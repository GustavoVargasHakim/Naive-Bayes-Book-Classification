The First Amendment

Preface	  
This Casebook is intended to be used in an upper-division course covering
the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Its 14 chapters are substantially the same length, with the exception of
Chapter One, the introduction, and Chapters Eleven and Twelve which in
combination are the usual length. It is intended for 13 or 14 week semester
that meets once or twice per week. Each Chapter contains a “Chapter
Outline” at the beginning for ease of reference.
The Casebook is organized with the Speech Clauses as Part One and the
Religion Clauses as Part Two. Unlike many other courses, there is no
accepted organizational scheme within these broad areas. As the
Introduction notes, First Amendment doctrine, especially within freedom of
speech, presents a varied and haphazard landscape. The Casebook follows a
scheme that has proven effective in my years of teaching the course to
hundreds of students.
The selection of cases tends toward the most recent and these tend to be less
heavily edited. These recent cases often contain extended discussions of
earlier cases that are not included in the Casebook.
The excerpted cases and all cases in the Notes contain the official citation.
However, within the text of excerpted cases, the full citations of cases are
not included: only the case name and year appears the first time the case is
cited within the opinion. Moreover, case citations are not always indicated
by ellipses. When content is omitted, this is indicated by this symbol: ***.
This Casebook has been immeasurably improved by comments from my
students in First Amendment at CUNY School of Law, especially those in
the class in the Spring of 2015 when a “dry run” of the Casebook was used.
Their responses to my queries (e.g., “which 5 pages did you find least
helpful in this chapter?”), their engagement with the materials and original
contributions, as well as their notations of typographical errors, are deeply
appreciated.

I.	  	   Text	  
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or
of the press; or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to
petition the Government from redress of grievances.

II.	  	   The	  Clauses	  
	  

A.	   The	  Religion	  Clauses	  

The religion clauses are two separate but intertwined clauses.
First, the text forbids Congress making laws respecting “an
establishment of religion.” The Establishment Clause - - - more properly
denominated an anti-Establishment Clause or disestablishment Clause,
but routinely called the Establishment Clause - - means at its most
basic that there cannot be a government religion. This is distinct from
many other nations in which there is a national religion, including Great
Britain’s Church of England. More specific meanings of what an
“establishment” of religion might mean have been the subject of
Robson

The First Amendment

numerous cases and controversies. Most vexing have been government
support for religious education and for government displays of religiosity.
Second, the text forbids Congress making laws that would prohibit “the
free exercise” of religion. This “freedom of religion” clause means at its
most basic that government cannot outlaw a religion. Again, the history
of England is instructive including criminal trials for heresy. And again,
the more specific meanings of “prohibiting” and “free exercise” have been
the subject of numerous cases and controversies. The extent to which
the government must accommodate religious beliefs and practices has
been the most contentious.
(Part Two, Chapters Eleven through Fourteen discuss the Religion
Clauses).

	  

B.	  	   The	  Free	  Speech	  Clause	  

The First Amendment’s “freedom of speech” clause is the primary means
of protecting expression. It is the clause that most people think of when
they think of the First Amendment and it occupies a central place in
First Amendment doctrine and theory. Indeed, other First Amendment
rights are often grounded in the free speech clause. (Part One treats the
extensive doctrine under the Speech Clause).

	  

C.	   The	  Press	  Clause	  

The text’s “or of the press” language immediately after the prohibition of
the abridgement of freedom of speech might seem to guarantee freedom
of the press as a separate right. Doctrinally, the “free press” clause is
often coextensive with the “free speech” clause. (The Press Clause is
further discussed in Chapter Four).

	  

D.	   The	  Assembly	  Clause	  

The Assembly Clause has not been the source of rights or doctrinal
explication. Some of the framers imagined the clause to be superfluous
and its interpretation has proven this to be true. (The Assembly Clause
is further discussed in Chapter Seven).

	  

E.	  	   The	  Petition	  Clause	  

Like the Assembly Clause, the Petition Clause has not been the source of
robust rights under the First Amendment. However, in Borough of
Duryea v. Guarnieri, 564 U.S. ___ (2011), the Court held that the Petition
Clause and the Speech Clause are not necessarily coextensive. In that
case, a public employee brought a First Amendment claim that he had
been terminated in retaliation for filing a grievance, i.e., a “petition.” The
Court held, however, that the Petition Clause should be interpreted in

Robson

The First Amendment

this case as coextensive with Speech Clause doctrine which would
require the employee to be speaking about a matter of public concern.
(The First Amendment rights of public employees are discussed in
Chapter Five).

	  

F.	  

Association:	  The	  “Missing”	  Clause	  

Note that the text of the First Amendment does not contain the word
“association” although it is often thought to include it. This right,
grounded in the Speech Clause, is often said to begin with the Court’s
decision in NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449 (1958)
(included in Chapter Eight). In addition to the right to anonymity in
belonging to an organization as in NAACP, other associational First
Amendment rights include the ability of organizations to determine their
membership in light of anti-discrimination laws. (These cases are
included in Chapter Six).

III.	   International	  Perspectives	  
The rights encompassed in the United States Constitution’s First
Amendment are generally included in human rights documents and
other national constitutions. The prohibition of government religion, as
mentioned above, is less universal.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1947) provides:
Article 18.
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right
includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in
community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief
in teaching, practice, worship and observance.
Article 19.
Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes
freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
Article 20.
(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
(2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (1966)
provides:
Article 18
1. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his
choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in
public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance,
practice and teaching.
2. No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or
to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.

Robson

The First Amendment

3. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such
limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety,
order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.
4. The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to have respect for the
liberty of parents and, when applicable, legal guardians to ensure the religious
and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions.
Article 19
1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.
2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include
freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds,
regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or
through any other media of his choice.
3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries
with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain
restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are
necessary:
(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;
(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of
public health or morals.
Article 20
1. Any propaganda for war shall be prohibited by law.
2. Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.
Article 21
The right of peaceful assembly shall be recognized. No restrictions may be
placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with
the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of
public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
Article 22
1. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of association with others, including
the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests.
2. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those
which are prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in
the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the
protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms
of others. This article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on
members of the armed forces and of the police in their exercise of this right.
3. Nothing in this article shall authorize States Parties to the International
Labour Organisation Convention of 1948 concerning Freedom of Association and
Protection of the Right to Organize to take legislative measures which would
prejudice, or to apply the law in such a manner as to prejudice, the guarantees
provided for in that Convention.

Note the qualifications and balancing in the ICCPR and the mandate for
the prohibition of hate speech. When the United States adopted the
ICCPR in 1992, it specifically included a reservation regarding Article 20:
That Article 20 does not authorize or require legislation or other action by the
United States that would restrict the right of free speech and association
protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.

IV.	   State	   Action	   and	   Incorporation	   Against	   the	  
States	  
The United States Constitution has two important features that are vital
in the consideration of its First Amendment.
First, there is the requirement of “state action” as evinced by the opening
words of the text: Congress shall make no law. Like other constitutional
protections (with the notable exception of the Thirteenth Amendment),
the First Amendment is a guarantee against infringement by the
government rather than private actors.
The First Amendment is notable, however, in that people often invoke it
against when they are “silenced” by criticism or even interrupted on a
talk show. For example, Dr. Laura Schlessinger, whose racial epithets on
her radio show have caused criticism, announced her retirement from
the show in 2010 reportedly claiming that she wants "to regain my First
Amendment rights." Sarah Palin also invoked the First Amendment in
two tweets defending Schlessinger:
Dr.Laura: don’t retreat…reload! (Steps aside bc her 1st Amend.rights ceased 2exist
thx 2activists trying 2silence”isn’t American,not fair”);
Dr.Laura=even more powerful & effective w/out the shackles, so watch out
Constitutional obstructionists. And b thankful 4 her voice,America!

Second, there is the question of federalism. Importantly, while the First
Amendment constrains only government, it constrains all governments.
Although the text begins “Congress shall make not law,” the provisions of
the First Amendment have been applied to the states (and thus their
subdivisions) through the process of selective incorporation under the
Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.
The First Amendment’s Speech Clause is considered the first of the rights
in the Bill of Rights to be incorporated against the states, see Gitlow v.
New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925). In Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 707
(1931), the Court noted discussed the Press Clause and stated it “is no
longer open to doubt that the liberty of the press and of speech is within
the liberty safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment from invasion by state action.”
The Religion Clauses were likewise deemed applicable to the states in the
Twentieth Century. In Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940),
the Court held that the “fundamental concept of liberty embodied” in the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “embraces the
liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment.” It continued, the “First

Robson

6

The First Amendment

Amendment declares that Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The
Fourteenth Amendment has rendered the legislatures of the states as
incompetent as Congress to enact such laws.”
However, because
Cantwell did not involve the Establishment Clause, the case of Everson v.
Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947), decided seven years later, is
generally considered authority for the proposition that the Establishment
Clause applies with equal force to the states as to the federal government.
There is one current United States Supreme Court Justice who has
expressed the opinion that the Establishment Clause is not incorporated
against the states. See Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. __ (2015)
(Thomas, J., concurring); Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542
U.S. 1, 49-51 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); Van Orden v.
Perry, 545 U. S. 677–693 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring); Zelman v.
Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639–680 (2002) (Thomas, J., concurring).
Justice Thomas has argued that unlike the Free Exercise Clause, which
protects an individual right, the “text and history of the Establishment
Clause strongly suggest that it is a federalism provision intended to
prevent Congress from interfering with state establishments.” Elk Grove,
542 U.S. at 49. Under Thomas’s view, states could “establish” a religion,
or, at the very least, the actions of states regarding establishment should
be analyzed with less rigor. The vast majority of First Amendment
practitioners and scholars, as well as judges, consider the Establishment
Clause to be applicable to the states and their subdivisions.

V.	   History:	  The	  Firstness	  of	  the	  First	  Amendment	  
It is often argued that the First Amendment contains the “first freedoms”
and were so highly valued by the Framers of the Constitution that they
were placed first.
However, the history is a bit more nuanced.
Articles of Amendment to the Constitution:

Consider the original

Congress of the United States begun and held at the City of New-York, on
Wednesday the fourth of March, one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine
(1789). Articles in addition to, and Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States of America, proposed by Congress and ratified by the Legislatures of the
several States, pursuant to the fifth Article of the original Constitution.
Original Amendments PASSED by Congress to be ratified by States
Article the first ... After the first enumeration required by the first article of the
Constitution, there shall be one Representative for every thirty thousand, until
the number shall amount to one hundred, after which the proportion shall be so
regulated by Congress, that there shall be not less than one hundred
Representatives, nor less than one Representative for every forty thousand

Robson

7

The First Amendment

persons, until the number of Representatives shall amount to two hundred; after
which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall not be
less than two hundred Representatives, nor more than one Representative for
every fifty thousand persons.
Article the second ... No law, varying the compensation for the services of the
Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of
Representatives shall have intervened.
Article the third ... Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Articles/Amendments One and Two are not ratified by the States. Thus,
Article/Amendment Third becomes Article/Amendment First: the current
First Amendment. (Note that Article/Amendment Two becomes the 27th
Amendment in 1992.)
Nevertheless, the Framers of the Constitution were undoubtedly
influenced by the history of England and their own experiences regarding
both speech and religion. In terms of speech and press, the “licensing” of
publications and criminal prosecutions for sedition were important. In
terms of religion, the violent history of religious conflicts in Great Britain
and the rest of Europe were paramount, especially given that the some
of the states were colonies founded on religious motives.

VI.	   Theoretical	  Perspectives	  
In addition to the usual theoretical perspectives governing constitutional
interpretation such as originalism and living constitutionalism, the First
Amendment provokes some distinct theoretical perspectives.
The absolutist perspective of the First Amendment gains credence from
the language of the Amendment: Congress shall make “no law” as
compared to other restraints in the Bill of Rights such as the Fourth
Amendment’s language of “unreasonable searches and seizures.” While
this absolutist perspective has not prevailed, it is often evoked, explicitly
or implicitly, in First Amendment arguments.
The notion of free speech is often premised on a “marketplace of ideas”
metaphor that appeared in early cases.
This capitalist sentiment
conceptualizes a free enterprise competition requiring little, if any,
government regulation. Another influential view is that of Alexander
Meiklejohn which envisions a more proactive view for government in
ensuring democratic processes; this might mean that the government
regulates abusive speech, for example, in the interest of democracy. A
good discussion comparing these two views is Robert Post, Reconciling

Robson

8

The First Amendment

Theory and Doctrine in First Amendment Jurisprudence, 88 Cal. L. Rev.
2353 (2000). Other views highlight an individualistic understanding of
free speech, akin to other rights accorded to autonomous persons.
However, no overarching theoretical perspective explains the disarray of
free speech theories and doctrines, especially because the distinctions
between theory and doctrine are often blurry. Even the question of
whether expression qualifies as speech can be complicated. The
categorization of types of expression - - - for example political or
commercial - - - is debated. Moreover, the exclusion of some types of
speech, for example obscenity, is also fraught. Concepts such as
“chilling speech” or “secondary effects” waver between theory and
doctrine.
Similarly, the status of religion is not amenable to an overall theoretical
perspective. In some senses, the two religion clauses are at odds if each
is extended to its logical conclusion. The Establishment Clause, more
accurately called the anti-Establishment Clause, generally means that
the government should not put its imprimatur on religion. However, the
Free Exercise Clause generally means that the government should
accommodate religious beliefs.
The issue is often when
“accommodation,” especially of majority beliefs, becomes an
“establishment” of religion objectionable to minority religious believers or
nonbelievers.
Additionally, protection of religious expression has been subject to
legislative action. These protections have prompted several important
and some controversial recent United States Supreme Court cases
(included in Chapter Fourteen).

VII.	   The	   Challenges	   of	   First	   Amendment	   Cases	   and	  
Controversies	  
There are several challenges to any study of the First Amendment.
First, many First Amendment cases, especially those involving speech
and speech-related issues, evoke numerous doctrines. At times, the
issue is what doctrine should apply. As Professor Julie Nice has
explained, a typical dispute can involve many of First Amendment
doctrines allowing the Court to “choose from among these various
doctrines to frame and structure its analysis” with an eye toward the
likely result. Julie A. Nice, How Equality Constitutes Liberty: The
Alignment of CLS v. Martinez, 38 HASTINGS CONST. L.Q. 631, 639-40
(2011).

Robson

9

The First Amendment

In her analysis of Christian Legal Society v. Martinez (excerpted in
Chapter Seven), Professor Nice contends that Martinez is a “textbook
example” of the problem. In Martinez, the Court could have focused on
the law school’s policy as content or even viewpoint based OR whether
the law school created a public forum OR the public university setting
OR the conditions of the benefit of student group recognition OR
compelled speech or compelled association OR free exercise of religion
OR on the prohibition of establishment of religion. Professor Nice
suggests that a fundamental question is whether the Court has been
consistent in selecting which doctrine will frame its decision. Id.
There is a good argument that the Court has not been consistent in
selecting doctrinal frames. Martinez may be a “textbook example,” but it
is not at all unusual. Many - - - perhaps even the majority - - - of cases
involve a choice of doctrine. This makes studying and litigating First
Amendment cases challenging.
A second challenge is doctrinal incoherence even within distinct
doctrines. This is not to say that there are not settled tests; there are.
This makes the First Amendment a consistent choice for those drafting
Bar Examination questions!
Nevertheless, the Court is often
undermining its own previously announced tests.
Third, the sheer number, the often extensive length, and the regularity of
fractured and closely divided opinions by the United States Supreme
Court can make First Amendment study challenging. Until the First
World War, the Court devoted little attention to the First Amendment,
but since then it has decided more than 500 cases that discuss the First
Amendment. Of course, not all of these cases are landmark cases or rest
exclusively on First Amendment grounds. Nevertheless, there is much
material.
Fourth and finally, other federal courts as well as state courts routinely
decide First Amendment cases, many of which are groundbreaking or
involve cutting-edge and unresolved questions of law.
These four challenges implicate this Casebook.
First, because of numerous doctrinal frames within a single case, there is
little agreement about organization and placement of cases within that
organization. Thus, casebooks and study aids deploy a dizzying array of
schemes and references to illustrative cases.
Generally speaking,
however, there is sharp divide between the Speech and Religion Clauses
(although a case may address both of these). Additionally, within speech,
there are distinct doctrines governing the press, public employees and
public school students, and commercial speech, although these doctrines
often overlap with other doctrines.
This Casebook deploys an

Robson

10

The First Amendment

organization that has worked well in previous years and points to
doctrinal selection issues as they occur.
Second, and not unlike other constitutional cases, the Court’s
articulation of a test in one case may be undermined by later cases. This
Casebook clearly identifies the landmark “tests” and then examines their
status.
Third, the number and length of the Supreme Court’s First Amendment
cases makes for difficult editing choices. The major cases are all
included or referenced. The Casebook’s inclusion preference has
generally been toward more recent cases and these cases have been more
lightly edited to provide more context for current controversies.
Fourth and finally, the Notes reference lower federal court and state
court cases. These cases often provide important context for developing
doctrine and issues.

during the “founding generation.”

The	  Alien	  Act:	  An	  Act	  Respecting	  Alien	  Enemies	  
APPROVED July 6, 1798

SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That whenever there shall be
a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government,
or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or
threatened against the territory of the United States, by any foreign nation or
government, and the President of the United States shall make public
proclamation of the event, all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the
hostile nation or government, being males of the age of fourteen years and
upwards, who shall be within the United States, and not actually naturalized,
shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien
enemies. And the President of the United States shall be, and he is hereby
authorized, in any event, as aforesaid, by his proclamation thereof, or other
public act, to direct the conduct to be observed, on the part of the United States,
towards the aliens who shall become liable, as aforesaid; the manner and
degree of the restraint to which they shall be subject, and in what cases, and
upon what security their residence shall be permitted, and to provide for the
removal of those, who, not being permitted to reside within the United States,
shall refuse or neglect to depart therefrom; and to establish any other
regulations which shall be found necessary in the premises and for the public
safety: Provided, that aliens resident within the United States, who shall
become liable as enemies, in the manner aforesaid, and who shall not be
chargeable with actual hostility, or other crime against the public safety, shall
be allowed, for the recovery, disposal, and removal of their goods and effects,
and for their departure, the full time which is, or shall be stipulated by any
treaty, where any shall have been between the United States, and the hostile
nation or government, of which they shall be natives, citizens, denizens or
subjects: and where no such treaty shall have existed, the President of the
United States may ascertain and declare such reasonable time as may be
consistent with the public safety, and according to the dictates of humanity and
national hospitality.
SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That after any proclamation shall be made as
aforesaid, it shall be the duty of the several courts of the United States, and of
each state, having criminal jurisdiction, and of the several judges and justices
of the courts of the United States, and they shall be, and are hereby respectively,
authorized upon complaint, against any alien or alien enemies, as aforesaid,
who shall be resident and at large within such jurisdiction or district, to the
danger of the public peace or safety, and contrary to the tenor or intent of such

shall and may establish in the premises, to cause such alien or aliens to be
duly apprehended and convened before such court, judge or justice; and after a
full examination and hearing on such complaint. and sufficient cause therefor
appearing, shall and may order such alien or aliens to be removed out of the
territory of the United States, or to give sureties of their good behaviour, or to

to execute such order, by himself or his deputy, or other discreet person or
persons to be employed by him, by causing a removal of such alien out of the
territory of the United States; and for such removal the marshal shall have the
warrant of the President of the United States, or of the court, judge or justice
ordering the same, as the case may be.

or shall knowingly and willingly assist or aid in writing, printing, uttering or
publishing any false, scandalous and malicious writing or writings against the
government of the United States, or either house of the Congress of the United
States, or the President of the United States, with intent to defame the said
government, or either house of the said Congress, or the said President, or to
bring them, or either of them, into contempt or disrepute; or to excite against
them, or either or any of them, the hatred of the good people of the United
States, or to stir up sedition within the United States, or to excite any unlawful
combinations therein, for opposing or resisting any law of the United States, or
any act of the President of the United States, done in pursuance of any such
law, or of the powers in him vested by the constitution of the United States, or
to resist, oppose, or defeat any such law or act, or to aid, encourage or abet any
hostile designs of any foreign nation against United States, their people or
government, then such person, being thereof convicted before any court of the
United States having jurisdiction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not
exceeding two thousand dollars, and by imprisonment not exceeding two years.
SEC. 3. And be it further enacted and declared, That if any person shall be
prosecuted under this act, for the writing or publishing any libel aforesaid, it
shall be lawful for the defendant, upon the trial of the cause, to give in evidence
in his defence, the truth of the matter contained in Republication charged as a
libel. And the jury who shall try the cause, shall have a right to determine the
law and the fact, under the direction of the court, as in other cases.
SEC. 4. And be it further enacted, That this act shall continue and be in force
until the third day of March, one thousand eight hundred and one, and no
longer: Provided, that the expiration of the act shall not prevent or defeat a
prosecution and punishment of any offence against the law, during the time it
shall be in force.

Notes	  
1.
Are these Acts consistent with our contemporary ideas of the high
regard in which the framers held the First Amendment? How do ideas of
criticism of the government and “citizenship” merge in the Acts?
2.
Consider 50 USC §§ 21–24 which remains in effect and allows for
the “restraint, regulation, and removal” of “aliens” who are “not actually
naturalized” in times of war or when the President makes a proclamation.
3.
Consider the proposed “Violent Radicalization and Homegrown
Terrorism Prevention Act” which would seek to address “Ideologically
Based Violence - the use, planned use, or threatened use of force or
violence by a group or individual to promote the group or individual's
political, religious, or social beliefs.”

A.	   The	  Challenge	  of	  World	  War	  I	  
Schenck	  v.	  United	  States	  
249 U.S. 47 (1919)

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
This is an indictment in three counts. The first charges a conspiracy to violate
the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, § 3, 40 Stat. 217, 219, by causing
and attempting to cause insubordination, &c., in the military and naval forces
of the United States, and to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service of
the United States, when the United States was at war with the German Empire,
to-wit, that the defendants willfully conspired to have printed and circulated to
men who had been called and accepted for military service under the Act of May
18, 1917, a document set forth and alleged to be calculated to cause such
insubordination and obstruction. The count alleges overt acts in pursuance of
the conspiracy, ending in the distribution of the document set forth. The second
count alleges a conspiracy to commit an offence against the United States, towit, to use the mails for the transmission of matter declared to be nonmailable
by Title XII, § 2 of the Act of June 15, 1917, to-wit, the above mentioned
document, with an averment of the same overt acts. The third count charges an
unlawful use of the mails for the transmission of the same matter and
otherwise as above. The defendants were found guilty on all the counts. They
set up the First Amendment to the Constitution forbidding Congress to make
any law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, and bringing the case
here on that ground have argued some other points also of which we must
dispose.
It is argued that the evidence, if admissible, was not sufficient to prove that the
defendant Schenck was concerned in sending the documents. According to the
testimony, Schenck said he was general secretary of the Socialist party, and
had charge of the Socialist headquarters from which the documents were sent.
He identified a book found there as the minutes of the Executive Committee of
the party. The book showed a resolution of August 13, 1917, that 15,000
leaflets should be printed on the other side of one of them in use, to be mailed
to men who had passed exemption boards, and for distribution. Schenck
personally attended to the printing. On August 20, the general secretary's
report said "Obtained new leaflets from printer and started work addressing
envelopes" &c., and there was a resolve that Comrade Schenck be allowed $125
for sending leaflets through the mail. He said that he had about fifteen or
sixteen thousand printed. There were files of the circular in question in the
inner office which he said were printed on the other side of the one sided
circular, and were there for distribution. Other copies were proved to have been
sent through the mails to drafted men. Without going into confirmatory details

Robson

The First Amendment

that were proved, no reasonable man could doubt that the defendant Schenck
was largely instrumental in sending the circulars about.***
The document in question, upon its first printed side, recited the first section of
the Thirteenth Amendment, said that the idea embodied in it was violated by
the Conscription Act, and that a conscript is little better than a convict. In
impassioned language, it intimated that conscription was despotism in its worst
form, and a monstrous wrong against humanity in the interest of Wall Street's
chosen few. It said "Do not submit to intimidation," but in form, at least,
confined itself to peaceful measures such as a petition for the repeal of the act.
The other and later printed side of the sheet was headed "Assert Your Rights." It
stated reasons for alleging that anyone violated the Constitution when he
refused to recognize "your right to assert your opposition to the draft," and went
on
If you do not assert and support your rights, you are helping to deny or
disparage rights which it is the solemn duty of all citizens and residents of the
United States to retain.

It described the arguments on the other side as coming from cunning
politicians and a mercenary capitalist press, and even silent consent to the
conscription law as helping to support an infamous conspiracy. It denied the
power to send our citizens away to foreign shores to shoot up the people of
other lands, and added that words could not express the condemnation such
cold-blooded ruthlessness deserves, &c., &c., winding up, "You must do your
share to maintain, support and uphold the rights of the people of this country."
Of course, the document would not have been sent unless it had been intended
to have some effect, and we do not see what effect it could be expected to have
upon persons subject to the draft except to influence them to obstruct the
carrying of it out. The defendants do not deny that the jury might find against
them on this point.
But it is said, suppose that that was the tendency of this circular, it is protected
by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Two of the strongest expressions
are said to be quoted respectively from well known public men. It well may be
that the prohibition of laws abridging the freedom of speech is not confined to
previous restraints, although to prevent them may have been the main purpose,
as intimated in Patterson v. Colorado (1907). We admit that, in many places
and in ordinary times, the defendants, in saying all that was said in the
circular, would have been within their constitutional rights. But the character
of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done. The most
stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting
fire in a theatre and causing a panic. It does not even protect a man from an
injunction against uttering words that may have all the effect of force. The
question in every case is whether the words used are used in such
circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger
that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to
prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree. When a nation is at war, many
things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that
their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight, and that no Court

Robson

19

The First Amendment

could regard them as protected by any constitutional right. It seems to be
admitted that, if an actual obstruction of the recruiting service were proved,
liability for words that produced that effect might be enforced. The statute of
1917, in § 4, punishes conspiracies to obstruct, as well as actual obstruction. If
the act (speaking, or circulating a paper), its tendency, and the intent with
which it is done are the same, we perceive no ground for saying that success
alone warrants making the act a crime. Indeed, that case might be said to
dispose of the present contention if the precedent covers all media concludendi.
But, as the right to free speech was not referred to specially, we have thought fit
to add a few words.
It was not argued that a conspiracy to obstruct the draft was not within the
words of the Act of 1917. The words are "obstruct the recruiting or enlistment
service," and it might be suggested that they refer only to making it hard to get
volunteers. Recruiting heretofore usually having been accomplished by getting
volunteers, the word is apt to call up that method only in our minds. But
recruiting is gaining fresh supplies for the forces, as well by draft as otherwise.
It is put as an alternative to enlistment or voluntary enrollment in this act. ***
Judgments affirmed.

Abrams	  v.	  United	  States	  
250 U.S. 616 (1919)

JUSTICE CLARKE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT; JUSTICE HOLMES FILED A DISSENTING
OPINION IN WHICH JUSTICE BRANDEIS JOINED.

MR. JUSTICE CLARKE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
On a single indictment, containing four counts, the five plaintiffs in error,
hereinafter designated the defendants, were convicted of conspiring to violate
provisions of the Espionage Act of Congress.
Each of the first three counts charged the defendants with conspiring, when the
United States was at war with the Imperial Government of Germany, to
unlawfully utter, print, write and publish: in the first count, "disloyal,
scurrilous and abusive language about the form of Government of the United
States;" in the second count, language "intended to bring the form of
Government of the United States into contempt, scorn, contumely and
disrepute;" and in the third count, language "intended to incite, provoke and
encourage resistance to the United States in said war." The charge in the fourth
count was that the defendants conspired,
when the United States was at war with the Imperial German Government,
unlawfully and willfully, by utterance, writing, printing and publication, to urge,
incite and advocate curtailment of production of things and products, to-wit,

Robson

20

The First Amendment

ordnance and ammunition, necessary and essential to the prosecution of the
war.

The offenses were charged in the language of the act of Congress.
* * * * [The Court excerpted the leaflets].
These excerpts sufficiently show that, while the immediate occasion for this
particular outbreak of lawlessness on the part of the defendant alien anarchists
may have been resentment caused by our Government's sending troops into
Russia as a strategic operation against the Germans on the eastern battle front,
yet the plain purpose of their propaganda was to excite, at the supreme crisis of
the war, disaffection, sedition, riots, and, as they hoped, revolution, in this
country for the purpose of embarrassing, and, if possible, defeating the military
plans of the Government in Europe. A technical distinction may perhaps be
taken between disloyal and abusive language applied to the form of our
government or language intended to bring the form of our government into
contempt and disrepute, and language of like character and intended to
produce like results directed against the President and Congress, the agencies
through which that form of government must function in time of war. But it is
not necessary to a decision of this case to consider whether such distinction is
vital or merely formal, for the language of these circulars was obviously
intended to provoke and to encourage resistance to the United States in the
war, as the third count runs, and the defendants, in terms, plainly urged and
advocated a resort to a general strike of workers in ammunition factories for the
purpose of curtailing the production of ordnance and munitions necessary and
essential to the prosecution of the war as is charged in the fourth count. Thus,
it is clear not only that some evidence, but that much persuasive evidence, was
before the jury tending to prove that the defendants were guilty as charged in
both the third and fourth counts of the indictment, and, under the long
established rule of law hereinbefore stated, the judgment of the District Court
must be
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES DISSENTING [MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS JOINS].
This indictment is founded wholly upon the publication of two leaflets which I
shall describe in a moment. The first count charges a conspiracy pending the
war with Germany to publish abusive language about the form of government of
the United States, laying the preparation and publishing of the first leaflet as
overt acts. The second count charges a conspiracy pending the war to publish
language intended to bring the form of government into contempt, laying the
preparation and publishing of the two leaflets as overt acts. The third count
alleges a conspiracy to encourage resistance to the United States in the same
war, and to attempt to effectuate the purpose by publishing the same leaflets.
The fourth count lays a conspiracy to incite curtailment of production of things
necessary to the prosecution of the war and to attempt to accomplish it by
publishing the second leaflet, to which I have referred.

Robson

21

The First Amendment

The first of these leaflets says that the President's cowardly silence about the
intervention in Russia reveals the hypocrisy of the plutocratic gang in
Washington. It intimates that "German militarism combined with allied
capitalism to crush the Russian evolution " -- goes on that the tyrants of the
world fight each other until they see a common enemy -- working class
enlightenment, when they combine to crush it, and that now militarism and
capitalism combined, though not openly, to crush the Russian revolution. It
says that there is only one enemy of the workers of the world, and that is
capitalism; that it is a crime for workers of America, &c., to fight the workers'
republic of Russia, and ends "Awake! Awake, you Workers of the World,
Revolutionists!" A note adds
It is absurd to call us pro-German. We hate and despise German militarism
more than do you hypocritical tyrants. We have more reasons for denouncing
German militarism than has the coward of the White House.

The other leaflet, headed "Workers -- Wake Up," with abusive language says
that America together with the Allies will march for Russia to help the CzeckoSlovaks in their struggle against the Bolsheviki, and that this time the
hypocrites shall not fool the Russian emigrants and friends of Russia in
America. It tells the Russian emigrants that they now must spit in the face of
the false military propaganda by which their sympathy and help to the
prosecution of the war have been called forth, and says that, with the money
they have lent or are going to lend, "they will make bullets not only for the
Germans, but also for the Workers Soviets of Russia," and further,
Workers in the ammunition factories, you are producing bullets, bayonets,
cannon, to murder not only the Germans, but also your dearest, best, who are
in Russia and are fighting for freedom.
It then appeals to the same Russian emigrants at some length not to consent to
the "inquisitionary expedition to Russia," and says that the destruction of the
Russian revolution is "the politics of the march to Russia." The leaflet winds up
by saying "Workers, our reply to this barbaric intervention has to be a general
strike!" and, after a few words on the spirit of revolution, exhortations not to be
afraid, and some usual tall talk ends, "Woe unto those who will be in the way of
progress. Let solidarity live! The Rebels."
No argument seems to me necessary to show that these pronunciamentos in no
way attack the form of government of the United States, or that they do not
support either of the first two counts. What little I have to say about the third
count may be postponed until I have considered the fourth. With regard to that,
it seems too plain to be denied that the suggestion to workers in the
ammunition factories that they are producing bullets to murder their dearest,
and the further advocacy of a general strike, both in the second leaflet, do urge
curtailment of production of things necessary to the prosecution of the war
within the meaning of the Act of May 16, 1918, c. 75, 40 Stat. 553, amending §
3 of the earlier Act of 1917. But to make the conduct criminal, that statute
requires that it should be "with intent by such curtailment to cripple or hinder

Robson

22

The First Amendment

the United States in the prosecution of the war." It seems to me that no such
intent is proved.
I am aware, of course, that the word intent as vaguely used in ordinary legal
discussion means no more than knowledge at the time of the act that the
consequences said to be intended will ensue. Even less than that will satisfy the
general principle of civil and criminal liability. A man may have to pay damages,
may be sent to prison, at common law might be hanged, if, at the time of his
act, he knew facts from which common experience showed that the
consequences would follow, whether he individually could foresee them or not.
But, when words are used exactly, a deed is not done with intent to produce a
consequence unless that consequence is the aim of the deed. It may be obvious,
and obvious to the actor, that the consequence will follow, and he may be liable
for it even if he regrets it, but he does not do the act with intent to produce it
unless the aim to produce it is the proximate motive of the specific act,
although there may be some deeper motive behind.
It seems to me that this statute must be taken to use its words in a strict and
accurate sense. They would be absurd in any other. A patriot might think that
we were wasting money on aeroplanes, or making more cannon of a certain
kind than we needed, and might advocate curtailment with success, yet, even if
it turned out that the curtailment hindered and was thought by other minds to
have been obviously likely to hinder the United States in the prosecution of the
war, no one would hold such conduct a crime. I admit that my illustration does
not answer all that might be said, but it is enough to show what I think, and to
let me pass to a more important aspect of the case. I refer to the First
Amendment to the Constitution, that Congress shall make no law abridging the
freedom of speech.
I never have seen any reason to doubt that the questions of law that alone were
before this Court in the cases of Schenck, Frohwerk and Debs, were rightly
decided. I do not doubt for a moment that, by the same reasoning that would
justify punishing persuasion to murder, the United States constitutionally may
punish speech that produces or is intended to produce a clear and imminent
danger that it will bring about forthwith certain substantive evils that the
United States constitutionally may seek to prevent. The power undoubtedly is
greater in time of war than in time of peace, because war opens dangers that do
not exist at other times.
But, as against dangers peculiar to war, as against others, the principle of the
right to free speech is always the same. It is only the present danger of
immediate evil or an intent to bring it about that warrants Congress in setting a
limit to the expression of opinion where private rights are not concerned.
Congress certainly cannot forbid all effort to change the mind of the country.
Now nobody can suppose that the surreptitious publishing of a silly leaflet by
an unknown man, without more, would present any immediate danger that its
opinions would hinder the success of the government arms or have any
appreciable tendency to do so. Publishing those opinions for the very purpose of
obstructing, however, might indicate a greater danger, and, at any rate, would

Robson

23

The First Amendment

have the quality of an attempt. * * * * It is necessary where the success of the
attempt depends upon others because, if that intent is not present, the actor's
aim may be accomplished without bringing about the evils sought to be
checked. An intent to prevent interference with the revolution in Russia might
have been satisfied without any hindrance to carrying on the war in which we
were engaged.
I do not see how anyone can find the intent required by the statute in any of the
defendants' words. The second leaflet is the only one that affords even a
foundation for the charge, and there, without invoking the hatred of German
militarism expressed in the former one, it is evident from the beginning to the
end that the only object of the paper is to help Russia and stop American
intervention there against the popular government -- not to impede the United
States in the war that it was carrying on. To say that two phrases, taken
literally, might import a suggestion of conduct that would have interference
with the war as an indirect and probably undesired effect seems to me by no
means enough to show an attempt to produce that effect.
* * * * In this case, sentences of twenty years' imprisonment have been imposed
for the publishing of two leaflets that I believe the defendants had as much
right to publish as the Government has to publish the Constitution of the
United States now vainly invoked by them. Even if I am technically wrong, and
enough can be squeezed from these poor and puny anonymities to turn the
color of legal litmus paper, I will add, even if what I think the necessary intent
were shown, the most nominal punishment seems to me all that possibly could
be inflicted, unless the defendants are to be made to suffer not for what the
indictment alleges, but for the creed that they avow -- a creed that I believe to
be the creed of ignorance and immaturity when honestly held, as I see no
reason to doubt that it was held here, but which, although made the subject of
examination at the trial, no one has a right even to consider in dealing with the
charges before the Court.
Persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me perfectly logical. If you
have no doubt of your premises or your power, and want a certain result with
all your heart, you naturally express your wishes in law, and sweep away all
opposition. To allow opposition by speech seems to indicate that you think the
speech impotent, as when a man says that he has squared the circle, or that
you do not care wholeheartedly for the result, or that you doubt either your
power or your premises. But when men have realized that time has upset many
fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very
foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better
reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the
thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is
the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That, at any
rate, is the theory of our Constitution. It is an experiment, as all life is an
experiment. Every year, if not every day, we have to wager our salvation upon
some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge. While that experiment is part
of our system, I think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to
check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with

Robson

24

The First Amendment

death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the
lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to
save the country. I wholly disagree with the argument of the Government that
the First Amendment left the common law as to seditious libel in force. History
seems to me against the notion. I had conceived that the United States, through
many years, had shown its repentance for the Sedition Act of 1798, by repaying
fines that it imposed. Only the emergency that makes it immediately dangerous
to leave the correction of evil counsels to time warrants making any exception to
the sweeping command, "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom
of speech." Of course, I am speaking only of expressions of opinion and
exhortations, which were all that were uttered here, but I regret that I cannot
put into more impressive words my belief that, in their conviction upon this
indictment, the defendants were deprived of their rights under the Constitution
of the United States.

268 U.S. 652 (1925)

JUSTICE SANFORD DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT; JUSTICE HOLMES FILED A DISSENTING
OPINION IN WHICH JUSTICE BRANDEIS JOINED.

MR. JUSTICE SANFORD DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Benjamin Gitlow was indicted in the Supreme Court of New York, with three
others, for the statutory crime of criminal anarchy. New York Penal Laws, §§
160, 161.*** The contention here is that the statute, by its terms and as applied
in this case, is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Its material provisions are:
§ 160. Criminal anarchy defined. Criminal anarchy is the doctrine that
organized government should be overthrown by force or violence, or by
assassination of the executive head or of any of the executive officials of

Robson

25

The First Amendment

government, or by any unlawful means. The advocacy of such doctrine either by
word of mouth or writing is a felony.
§ 161. Advocacy of criminal anarchy. Any person who:
1. By word of mouth or writing advocates, advises or teaches the duty, necessity
or propriety of overthrowing or overturning organized government by force or
violence, or by assassination of the executive head or of any of the executive
officials of government, or by any unlawful means; or,
2. Prints, publishes, edits, issues or knowingly circulates, sells, distributes or
publicly displays any book, paper, document, or written or printed matter in any
form, containing or advocating, advising or teaching the doctrine that organized
government should be overthrown by force, violence or any unlawful means
Is guilty of a felony and punishable by imprisonment or fine, or both.

The indictment was in two counts. The first charged that the defendant had
advocated, advised and taught the duty, necessity and propriety of
overthrowing and overturning organized government by force, violence and
unlawful means, by certain writings therein set forth entitled "The Left Wing
Manifesto"; the second, that he had printed, published and knowingly
circulated and distributed a certain paper called "The Revolutionary Age,"
containing the writings set forth in the first count advocating, advising and
teaching the doctrine that organized government should be overthrown by force,
violence and unlawful means.
The following facts were established on the trial by undisputed evidence and
admissions: the defendant is a member of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist
Party, a dissenting branch or faction of that party formed in opposition to its
dominant policy of "moderate Socialism." Membership in both is open to aliens
as well as citizens. The Left Wing Section was organized nationally at a
conference in New York City in June, 1919, attended by ninety delegates from
twenty different States. The conference elected a National Council, of which the
defendant was a member, and left to it the adoption of a "Manifesto." This was
published in The Revolutionary Age, the official organ of the Left Wing. The
defendant was on the board of managers of the paper, and was its business
manager. He arranged for the printing of the paper, and took to the printer the
manuscript of the first issue which contained the Left Wing Manifesto, and also
a Communist Program and a Program of the Left Wing that had been adopted
by the conference. Sixteen thousand copies were printed, which were delivered
at the premises in New York City used as the office of the Revolutionary Age and
the headquarters of the Left Wing, and occupied by the defendant and other
officials. These copies were paid for by the defendant, as business manager of
the paper. Employees at this office wrapped and mailed out copies of the paper
under the defendant's direction, and copies were sold from this office. It was
admitted that the defendant signed a card subscribing to the Manifesto and
Program of the Left Wing, which all applicants were required to sign before
being admitted to membership; that he went to different parts of the State to
speak to branches of the Socialist Party about the principles of the Left Wing
and advocated their adoption, and that he was responsible for the Manifesto as

Robson

26

The First Amendment

it appeared, that "he knew of the publication, in a general way, and he knew of
its publication afterwards, and is responsible for its circulation."
There was no evidence of any effect resulting from the publication and
circulation of the Manifesto.
No witnesses were offered in behalf of the defendant.
Coupled with a review of the rise of Socialism, [the Manifesto] condemned the
dominant "moderate Socialism" for its recognition of the necessity of the
democratic parliamentary state; repudiated its policy of introducing Socialism
by legislative measures, and advocated, in plain and unequivocal language, the
necessity of accomplishing the "Communist Revolution" by a militant and
"revolutionary Socialism", based on "the class struggle" and mobilizing the
"power of the proletariat in action," through mass industrial revolts developing
into mass political strikes and "revolutionary mass action", for the purpose of
conquering and destroying the parliamentary state and establishing in its place,
through a "revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat", the system of
Communist Socialism. The then recent strikes in Seattle and Winnipeg were
cited as instances of a development already verging on revolutionary action and
suggestive of proletarian dictatorship, in which the strike-workers were "trying
to usurp the functions of municipal government", and revolutionary Socialism,
it was urged, must use these mass industrial revolts to broaden the strike,
make it general and militant, and develop it into mass political strikes and
revolutionary mass action for the annihilation of the parliamentary state.
*** [Gitlow was convicted and the convictions upheld by the New York courts.]
The sole contention here is, essentially, that as there was no evidence of any
concrete result flowing from the publication of the Manifesto or of
circumstances showing the likelihood of such result, the statute as construed
and applied by the trial court penalizes the mere utterance, as such, of
"doctrine" having no quality of incitement, without regard either to the
circumstances of its utterance or to the likelihood of unlawful sequences, and
that, as the exercise of the right of free expression with relation to government
is only punishable "in circumstances involving likelihood of substantive evil,"
the statute contravenes the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The argument in support of this contention rests primarily upon the following
propositions: 1st, that the "liberty" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment
includes the liberty of speech and of the press, and 2nd, that while liberty of
expression "is not absolute," it may be restrained "only in circumstances where
its exercise bears a causal relation with some substantive evil, consummated,
attempted or likely," and as the statute "takes no account of circumstances," it
unduly restrains this liberty and is therefore unconstitutional.
The precise question presented, and the only question which we can consider
under this writ of error, then is whether the statute, as construed and applied
in this case by the state courts, deprived the defendant of his liberty of
expression in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Robson

27

The First Amendment

The statute does not penalize the utterance or publication of abstract "doctrine"
or academic discussion having no quality of incitement to any concrete action.
It is not aimed against mere historical or philosophical essays. It does not
restrain the advocacy of changes in the form of government by constitutional
and lawful means. What it prohibits is language advocating, advising or
teaching the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means. These
words imply urging to action. Advocacy is defined in the Century Dictionary as:
"1. The act of pleading for, supporting, or recommending; active espousal." It is
not the abstract "doctrine" of overthrowing organized government by unlawful
means which is denounced by the statute, but the advocacy of action for the
accomplishment of that purpose. It was so construed and applied by the trial
judge, who specifically charged the jury that:
A mere grouping of historical events and a prophetic deduction from them would
neither constitute advocacy, advice or teaching of a doctrine for the overthrow of
government by force, violence or unlawful means. [And] if it were a mere essay
on the subject, as suggested by counsel, based upon deductions from alleged
historical events, with no teaching, advice or advocacy of action, it would not
constitute a violation of the statute. . . .

The Manifesto, plainly, is neither the statement of abstract doctrine nor, as
suggested by counsel, mere prediction that industrial disturbances and
revolutionary mass strikes will result spontaneously in an inevitable process of
evolution in the economic system. It advocates and urges in fervent language
mass action which shall progressively foment industrial disturbances and,
through political mass strikes and revolutionary mass action, overthrow and
destroy organized parliamentary government. It concludes with a call to action
in these words:
The proletariat revolution and the Communist reconstruction of society -- the
struggle for these -- is now indispensable. . . . The Communist International
calls the proletariat of the world to the final struggle!

This is not the expression of philosophical abstraction, the mere prediction of
future events; it is the language of direct incitement.
The means advocated for bringing about the destruction of organized
parliamentary government, namely, mass industrial revolts usurping the
functions of municipal government, political mass strikes directed against the
parliamentary state, and revolutionary mass action for its final destruction,
necessarily imply the use of force and violence, and, in their essential nature,
are inherently unlawful in a constitutional government of law and order. That
the jury were warranted in finding that the Manifesto advocated not merely the
abstract doctrine of overthrowing organized government by force, violence and
unlawful means, but action to that end, is clear.
For present purposes, we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the
press which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by
Congress are among the fundamental personal rights and "liberties" protected

Robson

28

The First Amendment

by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by
the States. ***
It is a fundamental principle, long established, that the freedom of speech and
of the press which is secured by the Constitution does not confer an absolute
right to speak or publish, without responsibility, whatever one may choose, or
an unrestricted and unbridled license that gives immunity for every possible
use of language and prevents the punishment of those who abuse this freedom.
2 STORY ON THE CONSTITUTION, 5th ed., § 1580, p. 634; *** Reasonably limited, it
was said by Story in the passage cited, this freedom is an inestimable privilege
in a free government; without such limitation, it might become the scourge of
the republic.
That a State in the exercise of its police power may punish those who abuse
this freedom by utterances inimical to the public welfare, tending to corrupt
public morals, incite to crime, or disturb the public peace, is not open to
question.***
And, for yet more imperative reasons, a State may punish utterances
endangering the foundations of organized government and threatening its
overthrow by unlawful means. These imperil its own existence as a
constitutional State. Freedom of speech and press, said Story (supra) does not
protect disturbances to the public peace or the attempt to subvert the
government. It does not protect publications or teachings which tend to subvert
or imperil the government or to impede or hinder it in the performance of its
governmental duties. It does not protect publications prompting the overthrow
of government by force; the punishment of those who publish articles which
tend to destroy organized society being essential to the security of freedom and
the stability of the State. And a State may penalize utterances which openly
advocate the overthrow of the representative and constitutional form of
government of the United States and the several States, by violence or other
unlawful means. In short, this freedom does not deprive a State of the primary
and essential right of self-preservation, which, so long as human governments
endure, they cannot be denied.***
That utterances inciting to the overthrow of organized government by unlawful
means present a sufficient danger of substantive evil to bring their punishment
within the range of legislative discretion is clear. Such utterances, by their very
nature, involve danger to the public peace and to the security of the State. They
threaten breaches of the peace, and ultimate revolution. And the immediate
danger is none the less real and substantial because the effect of a given
utterance cannot be accurately foreseen. The State cannot reasonably be
required to measure the danger from every such utterance in the nice balance
of a jeweler's scale. A single revolutionary spark may kindle a fire that,
smouldering for a time, may burst into a sweeping and destructive
conflagration. It cannot be said that the State is acting arbitrarily or
unreasonably when, in the exercise of its judgment as to the measures
necessary to protect the public peace and safety, it seeks to extinguish the
spark without waiting until it has enkindled the flame or blazed into the

Robson

29

The First Amendment

conflagration. It cannot reasonably be required to defer the adoption of
measures for its own peace and safety until the revolutionary utterances lead to
actual disturbances of the public peace or imminent and immediate danger of
its own destruction; but it may, in the exercise of its judgment, suppress the
threatened danger in its incipiency.
We cannot hold that the present statute is an arbitrary or unreasonable
exercise of the police power of the State unwarrantably infringing the freedom of
speech or press, and we must and do sustain its constitutionality.
We need not enter upon a consideration of the English common law rule of
seditious libel or the Federal Sedition Act of 1798, to which reference is made in
the defendant's brief. These are so unlike the present statute that we think the
decisions under them cast no helpful light upon the questions here.
And finding, for the reasons stated, that the statute is not, in itself,
unconstitutional, and that it has not been applied in the present case in
derogation of any constitutional right, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES, DISSENTING.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS and I are of opinion that this judgment should be
reversed. The general principle of free speech, it seems to me, must be taken to
be included in the Fourteenth Amendment, in view of the scope that has been
given to the word "liberty" as there used, although perhaps it may be accepted
with a somewhat larger latitude of interpretation than is allowed to Congress by
the sweeping language that governs or ought to govern the laws of the United
States. If I am right, then I think that the criterion sanctioned by the full Court
in Schenck v. United States applies.
The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such
circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger
that they will bring about the substantive evils that [the State] has a right to
prevent.
*** If what I think the correct test is applied, it is manifest that there was no
present danger of an attempt to overthrow the government by force on the part
of the admittedly small minority who shared the defendant's views. It is said
that this manifesto was more than a theory, that it was an incitement. Every
idea is an incitement. It offers itself for belief, and, if believed, it is acted on
unless some other belief outweighs it or some failure of energy stifles the
movement at its birth. The only difference between the expression of an opinion
and an incitement in the narrower sense is the speaker's enthusiasm for the
result. Eloquence may set fire to reason. But whatever may be thought of the
redundant discourse before us, it had no chance of starting a present
conflagration. If, in the long run, the beliefs expressed in proletarian
dictatorship are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of the

Robson

community, the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their
chance and have their way.
If the publication of this document had been laid as an attempt to induce an
uprising against government at once, and not at some indefinite time in the
future, it would have presented a different question. The object would have
been one with which the law might deal, subject to the doubt whether there was
any danger that the publication could produce any result, or in other words,
whether it was not futile and too remote from possible consequences. But the
indictment alleges the publication, and nothing more.

274 U.S. 357 (1927)
JUSTICE SANFORD DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT; JUSTICE BRANDEIS FILED A
CONCURRING OPINION IN WHICH JUSTICE HOLMES JOINED.

MR. JUSTICE SANFORD DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
By a criminal information filed in the Superior Court of Alameda County,
California, the plaintiff in error was charged, in five counts, with violations of
the Criminal Syndicalism Act of that State. She was tried, convicted on the first
count, and sentenced to imprisonment. ***
The pertinent provisions of the [California] Criminal Syndicalism Act are:
Section 1. The term "criminal syndicalism" as used in this act is hereby defined
as any doctrine or precept advocating, teaching or aiding and abetting the
commission of crime, sabotage (which word is hereby defined as meaning willful
and malicious physical damage or injury to physical property), or unlawful acts
of force and violence or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of
accomplishing a change in industrial ownership or control, or effecting any
political change.
Sec. 2. Any person who: . . . 4. Organizes or assists in organizing, or is or
knowingly becomes a member of, any organization, society, group or assemblage
of persons organized or assembled to advocate, teach or aid and abet criminal
syndicalism.
Is guilty of a felony and punishable by imprisonment.

The first count of the information, on which the conviction was had charged
that, on or about November 28, 1919, in Alameda County, the defendant, in
violation of the Criminal Syndicalism Act,
did then and there unlawfully, willfully, wrongfully, deliberately and feloniously
organize and assist in organizing, and was, is, and knowingly became a member
of an organization, society, group and assemblage of persons organized and
assembled to advocate, teach, aid and abet criminal syndicalism.***

Robson

31

The First Amendment

The following facts, among many others, were established on the trial by
undisputed evidence: the defendant, a resident of Oakland, in Alameda County,
California, had been a member of the Local Oakland branch of the Socialist
Party. This Local sent delegates to the national convention of the Socialist Party
held in Chicago in 1919, which resulted in a split between the "radical" group
and the old-wing Socialists. The "radicals" -- to whom the Oakland delegates
adhered -- being ejected, went to another hall, and formed the Communist
Labor Party of America. Its Constitution provided for the membership of
persons subscribing to the principles of the Party and pledging themselves to be
guided by its Platform, and for the formation of state organizations conforming
to its Platform as the supreme declaration of the Party. In its "Platform and
Program," the Party declared that it was in full harmony with "the revolutionary
working class parties of all countries," and adhered to the principles of
Communism laid down in the Manifesto of the Third International at Moscow,
and that its purpose was "to create a unified revolutionary working class
movement in America," organizing the workers as a class in a revolutionary
class struggle to conquer the capitalist state for the overthrow of capitalist rule,
the conquest of political power and the establishment of a working class
government, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, in place of the state machinery
of the capitalists, which should make and enforce the laws, reorganize society
on the basis of Communism, and bring about the Communist Commonwealth -advocated, as the most important means of capturing state power, the action of
the masses, proceeding from the shops and factories, the use of the political
machinery of the capitalist state being only secondary; the organization of the
workers into "revolutionary industrial unions"; propaganda pointing out their
revolutionary nature and possibilities, and great industrial battles showing the
value of the strike as a political weapon -- commended the propaganda and
example of the Industrial Workers of the World and their struggles and
sacrifices in the class war -- pledged support and cooperation to "the
revolutionary industrial proletariat of America" in their struggles against the
capitalist class -- cited the Seattle and Winnipeg strikes and the numerous
strikes all over the country "proceeding without the authority of the old
reactionary Trade Union officials," as manifestations of the new tendency -- and
recommended that strikes of national importance be supported and given a
political character, and that propagandists and organizers be mobilized "who
cannot only teach, but actually help to put in practice the principles of
revolutionary industrial unionism and Communism."
Shortly thereafter, the Local Oakland withdrew from the Socialist Party and
sent accredited delegates, including the defendant, to a convention held in
Oakland in November, 1919, for the purpose of organizing a California branch
of the Communist Labor Party. The defendant, after taking out a temporary
membership in the Communist Labor Party, attended this convention as a
delegate and took an active part in its proceedings. She was elected a member
of the Credentials Committee, and, as its chairman, made a report to the
convention upon which the delegates were seated. She was also appointed a
member of the Resolutions Committee, and, as such, signed the following
resolution in reference to political action, among others proposed by the
Committee:

Robson

32

The First Amendment

The C.L.P. of California fully recognizes the value of political action as a means
of spreading communist propaganda; it insists that, in proportion to the
development of the economic strength of the working class, it, the working
class, must also develop its political power. The C.L.P. of California proclaims
and insists that the capture of political power, locally or nationally by the
revolutionary working class, can be of tremendous assistance to the workers in
their struggle of emancipation. Therefore, we again urge the workers who are
possessed of the right of franchise to cast their votes for the party which
represents their immediate and final interest -- the C.L.P. -- at all elections,
being fully convinced of the utter futility of obtaining any real measure of justice
or freedom under officials elected by parties owned and controlled by the
capitalist class.
The minutes show that this resolution, with the others proposed by the
committee, was read by its chairman to the convention before the Committee on
the Constitution had submitted its report. According to the recollection of the
defendant, however, she herself read this resolution. Thereafter, before the
report of the Committee on the Constitution had been acted upon, the
defendant was elected an alternate member of the State Executive Committee.
The Constitution, as finally read, was then adopted. This provided that the
organization should be named the Communist Labor Party of California; that it
should be "affiliated with" the Communist Labor Party of America, and
subscribe to its Program, Platform and Constitution, and, "through this
affiliation," be "joined with the Communist International of Moscow;" and that
the qualifications for membership should be those prescribed in the National
Constitution. The proposed resolutions were later taken, up and all adopted
except that on political action, which caused a lengthy debate, resulting in its
defeat and the acceptance of the National Program in its place. After this action,
the defendant, without, so far as appears, making any protest, remained in the
convention until it adjourned. She later attended as an alternate member one or
two meetings of the State Executive Committee in San Jose and San Francisco,
and stated, on the trial, that she was then a member of the Communist Labor
Party. She also testified that it was not her intention that the Communist Labor
Party of California should be an instrument of terrorism or violence, and that it
was not her purpose or that of the Convention to violate any known law.
In the light of this preliminary statement, we now take up, insofar as they
require specific consideration, the various grounds upon which it is here
contended that the Syndicalism Act and its application in this case is
repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
1. While it is not denied that the evidence warranted the jury in finding that the
defendant became a member of and assisted in organizing the Communist
Labor Party of California, and that this was organized to advocate, teach, aid or
abet criminal syndicalism as defined by the Act, it is urged that the Act, as here
construed and applied, deprived the defendant of her liberty without due
process of law in that it has made her action in attending the Oakland
convention unlawful by reason of "a subsequent event brought about against

Robson

33

The First Amendment

her will by the agency of others," with no showing of a specific intent on her
part to join in the forbidden purpose of the association, and merely because, by
reason of a lack of "prophetic" understanding, she failed to foresee the quality
that others would give to the convention. The argument is, in effect, that the
character of the state organization could not be forecast when she attended the
convention; that she had no purpose of helping to create an instrument of
terrorism and violence; that she
took part in formulating and presenting to the convention a resolution which, if
adopted, would have committed the new organization to a legitimate policy of
political reform by the use of the ballot;

that it was not until after the majority of the convention turned out to be
"contrary-minded, and other less temperate policies prevailed," that the
convention could have taken on the character of criminal syndicalism, and that,
as this was done over her protest, her mere presence in the convention,
however violent the opinions expressed therein, could not thereby become a
crime. This contention, while advanced in the form of a constitutional objection
to the Act, is in effect nothing more than an effort to review the weight of the
evidence for the purpose of showing that the defendant did not join and assist
in organizing the Communist Labor Party of California with a knowledge of its
unlawful character and purpose. ***
2. It is clear that the Syndicalism Act is not repugnant to the due process
clause by reason of vagueness and uncertainty of definition. *** The language of
§ 2, subd. 4, of the Act, under which the plaintiff in error was convicted, is
clear, the definition of "criminal syndicalism "specific. *** So, as applied here,
the Syndicalism Act required of the defendant no "prophetic" understanding of
its meaning. ***
3. Neither is the Syndicalism Act repugnant to the equal protection clause on
the ground that, as its penalties are confined to those who advocate a resort to
violent and unlawful methods as a means of changing industrial and political
conditions, it arbitrarily discriminates between such persons and those who
may advocate a resort to these methods as a means of maintaining such
conditions. *** The Syndicalism Act is not class legislation; it affects all alike, no
matter what their business associations or callings, who come within its terms
and do the things prohibited. ***
4. Nor is the Syndicalism Act, as applied in this case, repugnant to the due
process clause as a restraint of the rights of free speech, assembly, and
association.
That the freedom of speech which is secured by the Constitution does not
confer an absolute right to speak, without responsibility, whatever one may
choose, or an unrestricted and unbridled license giving immunity for every
possible use of language and preventing the punishment of those who abuse
this freedom, and that a State in the exercise of its police power may punish
those who abuse this freedom by utterances inimical to the public welfare,

Robson

34

The First Amendment

tending to incite to crime, disturb the public peace, or endanger the
foundations of organized government and threaten its overthrow by unlawful
means, is not open to question.
By enacting the provisions of the Syndicalism Act, the State has declared,
through its legislative body, that to knowingly be or become a member of or
assist in organizing an association to advocate, teach or aid and abet the
commission of crimes or unlawful acts of force, violence or terrorism as a
means of accomplishing industrial or political changes involves such danger to
the public peace and the security of the State, that these acts should be
penalized in the exercise of its police power. That determination must be given
great weight. Every presumption is to be indulged in favor of the validity of the
statute, and it may not be declared unconstitutional unless it is an arbitrary or
unreasonable attempt to exercise the authority vested in the State in the public
interest.
The essence of the offense denounced by the Act is the combining with others in
an association for the accomplishment of the desired ends through the
advocacy and use of criminal and unlawful methods. It partakes of the nature
of a criminal conspiracy. That such united and joint action involves even
greater danger to the public peace and security than the isolated utterances
and acts of individuals is clear. We cannot hold that, as here applied, the Act is
an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of the police power of the State,
unwarrantably infringing any right of free speech, assembly or association, or
that those persons are protected from punishment by the due process clause
who abuse such rights by joining and furthering an organization thus menacing
the peace and welfare of the State.
We find no repugnancy in the Syndicalism Act as applied in this case to either
the due process or equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment on
any of the grounds upon which its validity has been here challenged. ***
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS, CONCURRING [MR. JUSTICE HOLMES JOINS IN THIS OPINION].
Miss Whitney was convicted of the felony of assisting in organizing, in the year
1919, the Communist Labor Party of California, of being a member of it, and of
assembling with it. These acts are held to constitute a crime because the party
was formed to teach criminal syndicalism. The statute which made these acts a
crime restricted the right of free speech and of assembly theretofore existing.
The claim is that the statute, as applied, denied to Miss Whitney the liberty
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.
The felony which the statute created is a crime very unlike the old felony of
conspiracy or the old misdemeanor of unlawful assembly. The mere act of
assisting in forming a society for teaching syndicalism, of becoming a member
of it, or of assembling with others for that purpose, is given the dynamic quality
of crime. There is guilt although the society may not contemplate immediate

Robson

35

The First Amendment

promulgation of the doctrine. Thus, the accused is to be punished not for
contempt, incitement, or conspiracy, but for a step in preparation, which, if it
threatens the public order at all, does so only remotely. The novelty in the
prohibition introduced is that the statute aims not at the practice of criminal
syndicalism, nor even directly at the preaching of it, but at association with
those who propose to preach it.
Despite arguments to the contrary which had seemed to me persuasive, it is
settled that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to
matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure. Thus, all
fundamental rights comprised within the term liberty are protected by the
Federal Constitution from invasion by the States. The right of free speech, the
right to teach, and the right of assembly are, of course, fundamental rights.
These may not be denied or abridged. But, although the rights of free speech
and assembly are fundamental, they are not, in their nature, absolute. Their
exercise is subject to restriction if the particular restriction proposed is required
in order to protect the State from destruction or from serious injury, political,
economic, or moral. That the necessity which is essential to a valid restriction
does not exist unless speech would produce, or is intended to produce, a clear
and imminent danger of some substantive evil which the State constitutionally
may seek to prevent has been settled.
It is said to be the function of the legislature to determine whether, at a
particular time and under the particular circumstances, the formation of, or
assembly with, a society organized to advocate criminal syndicalism constitutes
a clear and present danger of substantive evil, and that, by enacting the law
here in question, the legislature of California determined that question in the
affirmative.
The legislature must obviously decide, in the first instance,
whether a danger exists which calls for a particular protective measure. But
where a statute is valid only in case certain conditions exist, the enactment of
the statute cannot alone establish the facts which are essential to its validity.
Prohibitory legislation has repeatedly been held invalid, because unnecessary,
where the denial of liberty involved was that of engaging in a particular
business. The power of the courts to strike down an offending law is no less
when the interests involved are not property rights, but the fundamental
personal rights of free speech and assembly.
This Court has not yet fixed the standard by which to determine when a danger
shall be deemed clear; how remote the danger may be and yet be deemed
present, and what degree of evil shall be deemed sufficiently substantial to
justify resort to abridgement of free speech and assembly as the means of
protection. To reach sound conclusions on these matters, we must bear in mind
why a State is, ordinarily, denied the power to prohibit dissemination of social,
economic and political doctrine which a vast majority of its citizens believes to
be false and fraught with evil consequence.
Those who won our independence believed that the final end of the State was to
make men free to develop their faculties, and that, in its government, the
deliberative forces should prevail over the arbitrary. They valued liberty both as

Robson

36

The First Amendment

an end, and as a means. They believed liberty to be the secret of happiness, and
courage to be the secret of liberty. They believed that freedom to think as you
will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and
spread of political truth; that, without free speech and assembly, discussion
would be futile; that, with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate
protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest
menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty,
and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government.
They recognized the risks to which all human institutions are subject. But they
knew that order cannot be secured merely through fear of punishment for its
infraction; that it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and imagination;
that fear breeds repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces
stable government; that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss
freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies, and that the fitting remedy
for evil counsels is good ones. Believing in the power of reason as applied
through public discussion, they eschewed silence coerced by law -- the
argument of force in its worst form. Recognizing the occasional tyrannies of
governing majorities, they amended the Constitution so that free speech and
assembly should be guaranteed.
Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and
assembly. Men feared witches and burnt women. It is the function of speech to
free men from the bondage of irrational fears. To justify suppression of free
speech, there must be reasonable ground to fear that serious evil will result if
free speech is practiced. There must be reasonable ground to believe that the
danger apprehended is imminent. There must be reasonable ground to believe
that the evil to be prevented is a serious one. Every denunciation of existing law
tends in some measure to increase the probability that there will be violation of
it. Condonation of a breach enhances the probability. Expressions of approval
add to the probability. Propagation of the criminal state of mind by teaching
syndicalism increases it. Advocacy of law-breaking heightens it still further. But
even advocacy of violation, however reprehensible morally, is not a justification
for denying free speech where the advocacy falls short of incitement and there is
nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on. The wide
difference between advocacy and incitement, between preparation and attempt,
between assembling and conspiracy, must be borne in mind. In order to
support a finding of clear and present danger, it must be shown either that
immediate serious violence was to be expected or was advocated, or that the
past conduct furnished reason to believe that such advocacy was then
contemplated.
Those who won our independence by revolution were not cowards. They did not
fear political change. They did not exalt order at the cost of liberty. To
courageous, self-reliant men, with confidence in the power of free and fearless
reasoning applied through the processes of popular government, no danger
flowing from speech can be deemed clear and present unless the incidence of
the evil apprehended is so imminent that it may befall before there is
opportunity for full discussion. If there be time to expose through discussion
the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the
remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence. Only an emergency
Robson

37

The First Amendment

can justify repression. Such must be the rule if authority is to be reconciled
with freedom. Such, in my opinion, is the command of the Constitution. It is
therefore always open to Americans to challenge a law abridging free speech
and assembly by showing that there was no emergency justifying it.
Moreover, even imminent danger cannot justify resort to prohibition of these
functions essential to effective democracy unless the evil apprehended is
relatively serious. Prohibition of free speech and assembly is a measure so
stringent that it would be inappropriate as the means for averting a relatively
trivial harm to society. A police measure may be unconstitutional merely
because the remedy, although effective as means of protection, is unduly harsh
or oppressive. Thus, a State might, in the exercise of its police power, make any
trespass upon the land of another a crime, regardless of the results or of the
intent or purpose of the trespasser. It might, also, punish an attempt, a
conspiracy, or an incitement to commit the trespass. But it is hardly
conceivable that this Court would hold constitutional a statute which punished
as a felony the mere voluntary assembly with a society formed to teach that
pedestrians had the moral right to cross unenclosed, unposted, wastelands and
to advocate their doing so, even if there was imminent danger that advocacy
would lead to a trespass. The fact that speech is likely to result in some violence
or in destruction of property is not enough to justify its suppression. There
must be the probability of serious injury to the State. Among free men, the
deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent crime are education and
punishment for violations of the law, not abridgment of the rights of free speech
and assembly. ***
Whenever the fundamental rights of free speech and assembly are alleged to
have been invaded, it must remain open to a defendant to present the issue
whether there actually did exist at the time a clear danger; whether the danger,
if any, was imminent, and whether the evil apprehended was one so substantial
as to justify the stringent restriction interposed by the legislature. The
legislative declaration, like the fact that the statute was passed and was
sustained by the highest court of the State, creates merely a rebuttable
presumption that these conditions have been satisfied.
Whether in 1919, when Miss Whitney did the things complained of, there was
in California such clear and present danger of serious evil might have been
made the important issue in the case. She might have required that the issue
be determined either by the court or the jury. She claimed below that the
statute, as applied to her, violated the Federal Constitution; but she did not
claim that it was void because there was no clear and present danger of serious
evil, nor did she request that the existence of these conditions of a valid
measure thus restricting the rights of free speech and assembly be passed upon
by the court or a jury. On the other hand, there was evidence on which the
court or jury might have found that such danger existed. I am unable to assent
to the suggestion in the opinion of the Court that assembling with a political
party, formed to advocate the desirability of a proletarian revolution by mass
action at some date necessarily far in the future, is not a right within the
protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the present case, however, there

Robson

38

The First Amendment

was other testimony which tended to establish the existence of a conspiracy, on
the part of members of the International Workers of the World, to commit
present serious crimes, and likewise to show that such a conspiracy would be
furthered by the activity of the society of which Miss Whitney was a member.
Under these circumstances, the judgment of the state court cannot be
disturbed.

Notes	  
1.
As the Court makes clear in Gitlow in 1925, the First Amendment
is incorporated against the states through the liberty provision of the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Note in later cases
how the question of incorporation resurfaces. Note also the relationship
between due process arguments and First Amendment arguments.
2.
The Court decided Debs v. United States, 249 U.S. 211 (1919), the
same year as Schenck, on which it largely relied. In this brief opinion,
the Court upheld Eugene Debs’ conviction for an anti-war speech
criticizing United States involvement in World War I and upheld the
Espionage Act of 1917. Debs was a prominent labor organizer and
candidate of the Socialist Party of America for the US presidency. Indeed,
Debs was a candidate in the 1920 Presidential election while he was in
prison for this conviction; he earned more than 3% of the vote. President
Woodrow Wilson denounced Debs as a “traitor” and refused to grant
clemency, but in 1921, President Horace Harding commuted Debs’
sentence to time-served and soon after the two met personally. Debs
died in 1926.
3.
Like Eugene Debs, Anita Whitney was also well-known. How does
the social or political status of the speaker influence the Court? Should
it? What is the relevance of the characterization of the defendants as
“poor and puny anonymities” in Holmes’ dissent in Abrams?
4.
The oft-called “war hypothesis” of First Amendment speech
doctrine is derived from these cases. Is there language in the cases that
would support a “war is different” perspective? Consider whether the
notion of “war” is extended in the rest of the cases in this Chapter.

JUSTICE BLACK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER FILED A
DISSENTING OPINION JOINED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE [STONE], JUSTICE ROBERTS AND JUSTICE
BYRNES.
MR.

JUSTICE BLACK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

These two cases, while growing out of different circumstances and concerning
different parties, both relate to the scope of our national constitutional policy
safeguarding free speech and a free press. All of the petitioners were adjudged
guilty and fined for contempt of court by the Superior Court of Los Angeles
County. Their conviction rested upon comments pertaining to pending litigation
which were published in newspapers. In the Superior Court, and later in the
California Supreme Court, petitioners challenged the state's action as an
abridgment, prohibited by the Federal Constitution, of freedom of speech and of
the press; but the Superior Court overruled this contention, and the Supreme
Court affirmed. The importance of the constitutional question prompted us to
grant certiorari. ***
In presenting the proposals which were later embodied in the Bill of Rights,
James Madison, the leader in the preparation of the First Amendment, said:
"Although I know whenever the great rights, the trial by jury, freedom of the
press, or liberty of conscience, come in question in that body [Parliament], the
invasion of them is resisted by able advocates, yet their Magna Charta does not
contain any one provision for the security of those rights, respecting which the
people of America are most alarmed. The freedom of the press and rights of
conscience, those choicest privileges of the people, are unguarded in the British
Constitution." 1 Annals of Congress 1789-1790, 434. And Madison elsewhere
wrote that "the state of the press . . . under the common law, cannot . . . be the
standard of its freedom in the United States."
There are no contrary implications in any part of the history of the period in
which the First Amendment was framed and adopted. No purpose in ratifying
the Bill of Rights was clearer than that of securing for the people of the United
States much greater freedom of religion, expression, assembly, and petition
than the people of Great Britain had ever enjoyed. It cannot be denied, for
example, that the religious test oath or the restrictions upon assembly then
prevalent in England would have been regarded as measures which the
Constitution prohibited the American Congress from passing. And since the
same unequivocal language is used with respect to freedom of the press, it
signifies a similar enlargement of that concept as well. Ratified as it was while
the memory of many oppressive English restrictions on the enumerated liberties
was still fresh, the First Amendment cannot reasonably be taken as approving
prevalent English practices. On the contrary, the only conclusion supported by

Robson

40

The First Amendment

history is that the unqualified prohibitions laid down by the framers were
intended to give to liberty of the press, as to the other liberties, the broadest
scope that could be countenanced in an orderly society.
The implications of subsequent American history confirm such a construction
of the First Amendment. To be sure, it occurred no more to the people who lived
in the decades following Ratification than it would to us now that the power of
courts to protect themselves from disturbances and disorder in the court room
by use of contempt proceedings could seriously be challenged as conflicting
with constitutionally secured guarantees of liberty. In both state and federal
courts, this power has been universally recognized. But attempts to expand it
in the post-Ratification years evoked popular reactions that bespeak a feeling of
jealous solicitude for freedom of the press. In Pennsylvania and New York, for
example, heated controversies arose over alleged abuses in the exercise of the
contempt power, which in both places culminated in legislation practically
forbidding summary punishment for publications.
*** [W]e are convinced that the judgments below result in a curtailment of
expression that cannot be dismissed as insignificant. If they can be justified at
all, it must be in terms of some serious substantive evil which they are designed
to avert. The substantive evil here sought to be averted has been variously
described below. It appears to be double: disrespect for the judiciary; and
disorderly and unfair administration of justice. The assumption that respect for
the judiciary can be won by shielding judges from published criticism wrongly
appraises the character of American public opinion. For it is a prized American
privilege to speak one's mind, although not always with perfect good taste, on
all public institutions. And an enforced silence, however limited, solely in the
name of preserving the dignity of the bench, would probably engender
resentment, suspicion, and contempt much more than it would enhance
respect.
The other evil feared, disorderly and unfair administration of justice, is more
plausibly associated with restricting publications which touch upon pending
litigation. The very word "trial" connotes decisions on the evidence and
arguments properly advanced in open court. Legal trials are not like elections,
to be won through the use of the meeting-hall, the radio, and the newspaper.
But we cannot start with the assumption that publications of the kind here
involved actually do threaten to change the nature of legal trials, and that to
preserve judicial impartiality, it is necessary for judges to have a contempt
power by which they can close all channels of public expression to all matters
which touch upon pending cases. We must therefore turn to the particular
utterances here in question and the circumstances of their publication to
determine to what extent the substantive evil of unfair administration of justice
was a likely consequence, and whether the degree of likelihood was sufficient to
justify summary punishment.
The Los Angeles Times Editorials. The Times-Mirror Company, publisher of the
Los Angeles Times, and L.D. Hotchkiss, its managing editor, were cited for
contempt for the publication of three editorials. Both found by the trial court to
be responsible for one of the editorials, the company and Hotchkiss were each
fined $100. The company alone was held responsible for the other two, and was
fined $100 more on account of one, and $300 more on account of the other.

Robson

The First Amendment

The $300 fine presumably marks the most serious offense. The editorial thus
distinguished was entitled "Probation for Gorillas?" After vigorously denouncing
two members of a labor union who had previously been found guilty of
assaulting nonunion truck drivers, it closes with the observation: "Judge A.A.
Scott will make a serious mistake if he grants probation to Matthew Shannon
and Kennan Holmes. This community needs the example of their assignment to
the jute mill." Judge Scott had previously set a day (about a month after the
publication) for passing upon the application of Shannon and Holmes for
probation and for pronouncing sentence.
The basis for punishing the publication as contempt was by the trial court said
to be its "inherent tendency" and by the [California] Supreme Court its
"reasonable tendency" to interfere with the orderly administration of justice in
an action then before a court for consideration. In accordance with what we
have said on the "clear and present danger" cases, neither "inherent tendency"
nor "reasonable tendency" is enough to justify a restriction of free expression.
But even if they were appropriate measures, we should find exaggeration in the
use of those phrases to describe the facts here. ***
The Bridges Telegram. While a motion for a new trial was pending in a case
involving a dispute between an A.F. of L. union and a C.I.O. union of which
Bridges was an officer, he either caused to be published or acquiesced in the
publication of a telegram which he had sent to the Secretary of Labor. The
telegram referred to the judge's decision as "outrageous"; said that attempted
enforcement of it would tie up the port of Los Angeles and involve the entire
Pacific Coast; and concluded with the announcement that the C.I.O. union,
representing some twelve thousand members, did "not intend to allow state
courts to override the majority vote of members in choosing its officers and
representatives and to override the National Labor Relations Board."
Apparently Bridges' conviction is not rested at all upon his use of the word
"outrageous." The remainder of the telegram fairly construed appears to be a
statement that if the court's decree should be enforced there would be a strike.
It is not claimed that such a strike would have been in violation of the terms of
the decree, nor that in any other way it would have run afoul of the law of
California. On no construction, therefore, can the telegram be taken as a threat
either by Bridges or the union to follow an illegal course of action.
Moreover, this statement of Bridges was made to the Secretary of Labor, who is
charged with official duties in connection with the prevention of strikes.
Whatever the cause might be if a strike was threatened or possible the
Secretary was entitled to receive all available information. Indeed, the Supreme
Court of California recognized that, publication in the newspapers aside, in
sending the message to the Secretary, Bridges was exercising the right of
petition to a duly accredited representative of the United States Government, a
right protected by the First Amendment.
It must be recognized that Bridges was a prominent labor leader speaking at a
time when public interest in the particular labor controversy was at its height.
The observations we have previously made here upon the timeliness and
importance of utterances as emphasizing rather than diminishing the value of
constitutional protection, and upon the breadth and seriousness of the

Robson

42

The First Amendment

censorial effects of punishing publications in the manner followed below, are
certainly no less applicable to a leading spokesman for labor than to a powerful
newspaper taking another point of view.
*** Again, we find exaggeration in the conclusion that the utterance even
"tended" to interfere with justice. If there was electricity in the atmosphere, it
was generated by the facts; the charge added by the Bridges telegram can be
dismissed as negligible. The words of Mr. Justice Holmes, spoken in reference
to very different facts, seem entirely applicable here: "I confess that I cannot
find in all this or in the evidence in the case anything that would have affected
a mind of reasonable fortitude, and still less can I find there anything that
obstructed the administration of justice in any sense that I possibly can give to
those words."
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, WITH WHOM CONCURRED THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR.
JUSTICE ROBERTS AND MR. JUSTICE BYRNES, DISSENTING.
Our whole history repels the view that it is an exercise of one of the civil
liberties secured by the Bill of Rights for a leader of a large following or for a
powerful metropolitan newspaper to attempt to overawe a judge in a matter
immediately pending before him. The view of the majority deprives California of
means for securing to its citizens justice according to law — means which, since
the Union was founded, have been the possession, hitherto unchallenged, of all
the states. This sudden break with the uninterrupted course of constitutional
history has no constitutional warrant. To find justification for such deprivation
of the historic powers of the states is to misconceive the idea of freedom of
thought and speech as guaranteed by the Constitution.***

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON ANNOUNCED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT.
Petitioners were indicted in July, 1948, for violation of the conspiracy
provisions of the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 671, 18 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) § 11, during the
period of April, 1945, to July, 1948. The pretrial motion to quash the
indictment on the grounds, inter alia, that the statute was unconstitutional was
denied. A verdict of guilty as to all the petitioners was returned by the jury. The

Robson

43

The First Amendment

Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions. We granted certiorari, limited to the
following two questions: (1) Whether either § 2 or § 3 of the Smith Act,
inherently or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates the First
Amendment and other provisions of the Bill of Rights; (2) whether either § 2 or §
3 of the Act, inherently or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates
the First and Fifth Amendments because of indefiniteness.
Sections 2 and 3 of the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 671, 18 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) §§ 10, 11
(see present 18 U. S. C. § 2385), provide as follows:
"SEC. 2. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person—
"(1) to knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise, or teach the duty, necessity,
desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the
United States by force or violence, or by the assassination of any officer of any
such government;
"(2) with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any government in the
United States, to print, publish, edit, issue, circulate, sell, distribute, or publicly
display any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching the duty,
necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any
government in the United States by force or violence;
"(3) to organize or help to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons
who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any
government in the United States by force or violence; or to be or become a
member of, or affiliate with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons,
knowing the purposes thereof.
"(b) For the purposes of this section, the term `government in the United States'
means the Government of the United States, the government of any State,
Territory, or possession of the United States, the government of the District of
Columbia, or the government of any political subdivision of any of them.
"SEC. 3. It shall be unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, or to conspire
to commit, any of the acts prohibited by the provisions of this title."

The indictment charged the petitioners with wilfully and knowingly conspiring
(1) to organize as the Communist Party of the United States of America a
society, group and assembly of persons who teach and advocate the overthrow
and destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence,
and (2) knowingly and wilfully to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of
overthrowing and destroying the Government of the United States by force and
violence. The indictment further alleged that § 2 of the Smith Act proscribes
these acts and that any conspiracy to take such action is a violation of § 3 of
the Act.
The trial of the case extended over nine months, six of which were devoted to
the taking of evidence, resulting in a record of 16,000 pages. Our limited grant
of the writ of certiorari has removed from our consideration any question as to
the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's determination that
petitioners are guilty of the offense charged. Whether on this record petitioners
did in fact advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence is
not before us *** [but by] virtue of their control over the political apparatus of
the Communist Political Association, petitioners were able to transform that
organization into the Communist Party; that the policies of the Association were

Robson

44

The First Amendment

changed from peaceful cooperation with the United States and its economic and
political structure to a policy which had existed before the United States and
the Soviet Union were fighting a common enemy, namely, a policy which worked
for the overthrow of the Government by force and violence; that the Communist
Party is a highly disciplined organization, adept at infiltration into strategic
positions, use of aliases, and double-meaning language; that the Party is rigidly
controlled; that Communists, unlike other political parties, tolerate no
dissension from the policy laid down by the guiding forces, but that the
approved program is slavishly followed by the members of the Party; that the
literature of the Party and the statements and activities of its leaders,
petitioners here, advocate, and the general goal of the Party was, during the
period in question, to achieve a successful overthrow of the existing order by
force and violence.
I.
It will be helpful in clarifying the issues to treat next the contention that the
trial judge improperly interpreted the statute by charging that the statute
required an unlawful intent before the jury could convict. ***
A survey of Title 18 of the U. S. Code indicates that the vast majority of the
crimes designated by that Title require, by express language, proof of the
existence of a certain mental state, in words such as "knowingly," "maliciously,"
"wilfully," "with the purpose of," "with intent to," or combinations or
permutations of these and synonymous terms. The existence of a mens rea is
the rule of, rather than the exception to, the principles of Anglo-American
criminal jurisprudence. *** If that precise mental state may be an essential
element of a crime, surely an intent to overthrow the Government of the United
States by advocacy thereof is equally susceptible of proof.
II.
The obvious purpose of the statute is to protect existing Government, not from
change by peaceable, lawful and constitutional means, but from change by
violence, revolution and terrorism. That it is within the power of the Congress to
protect the Government of the United States from armed rebellion is a
proposition which requires little discussion. Whatever theoretical merit there
may be to the argument that there is a "right" to rebellion against dictatorial
governments is without force where the existing structure of the government
provides for peaceful and orderly change. We reject any principle of
governmental helplessness in the face of preparation for revolution, which
principle, carried to its logical conclusion, must lead to anarchy. No one could
conceive that it is not within the power of Congress to prohibit acts intended to
overthrow the Government by force and violence. The question with which we
are concerned here is not whether Congress has such power, but whether the
means which it has employed conflict with the First and Fifth Amendments to
the Constitution.
One of the bases for the contention that the means which Congress has
employed are invalid takes the form of an attack on the face of the statute on
the grounds that by its terms it prohibits academic discussion of the merits of
Marxism-Leninism, that it stifles ideas and is contrary to all concepts of a free

Robson

45

The First Amendment

speech and a free press. Although we do not agree that the language itself has
that significance, we must bear in mind that it is the duty of the federal courts
to interpret federal legislation in a manner not inconsistent with the demands of
the Constitution. ***
The very language of the Smith Act negates the interpretation which petitioners
would have us impose on that Act. It is directed at advocacy, not discussion.
Thus, the trial judge properly charged the jury that they could not convict if
they found that petitioners did "no more than pursue peaceful studies and
discussions or teaching and advocacy in the realm of ideas." He further charged
that it was not unlawful "to conduct in an American college or university a
course explaining the philosophical theories set forth in the books which have
been placed in evidence." Such a charge is in strict accord with the statutory
language, and illustrates the meaning to be placed on those words. Congress
did not intend to eradicate the free discussion of political theories, to destroy
the traditional rights of Americans to discuss and evaluate ideas without fear of
governmental sanction. Rather Congress was concerned with the very kind of
activity in which the evidence showed these petitioners engaged.
III.
But although the statute is not directed at the hypothetical cases which
petitioners have conjured, its application in this case has resulted in
convictions for the teaching and advocacy of the overthrow of the Government
by force and violence, which, even though coupled with the intent to accomplish
that overthrow, contains an element of speech. For this reason, we must pay
special heed to the demands of the First Amendment marking out the
boundaries of speech.
*** [T]he basis of the First Amendment is the hypothesis that speech can rebut
speech, propaganda will answer propaganda, free debate of ideas will result in
the wisest governmental policies. It is for this reason that this Court has
recognized the inherent value of free discourse. An analysis of the leading cases
in this Court which have involved direct limitations on speech, however, will
demonstrate that both the majority of the Court and the dissenters in particular
cases have recognized that this is not an unlimited, unqualified right, but that
the societal value of speech must, on occasion, be subordinated to other values
and considerations.
No important case involving free speech was decided by this Court prior to
Schenck v.United States (1919). Indeed, the summary treatment accorded an
argument based upon an individual's claim that the First Amendment protected
certain utterances indicates that the Court at earlier dates placed no unique
emphasis upon that right. It was not until the classic dictum of Justice Holmes
in the Schenck case that speech per se received that emphasis in a majority
opinion. That case involved a conviction under the Criminal Espionage Act, 40
Stat. 217. The question the Court faced was whether the evidence was sufficient
to sustain the conviction. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Holmes
stated that the "question in every case is whether the words used are used in
such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present

Robson

46

The First Amendment

danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right
to prevent." ***
The basis of [Justices Holmes and Brandeis dissent in Abrams and other
opinions] was that, because of the protection which the First Amendment gives
to speech, the evidence in each case was insufficient to show that the
defendants had created the requisite danger under Schenck. But these dissents
did not mark a change of principle. The dissenters doubted only the probable
effectiveness of the puny efforts toward subversion. In Abrams, they wrote, "I do
not doubt for a moment that by the same reasoning that would justify
punishing persuasion to murder, the United States constitutionally may punish
speech that produces or is intended to produce a clear and imminent danger
that it will bring about forthwith certain substantive evils that the United States
constitutionally may seek to prevent." ***
The rule we deduce from these cases is that where an offense is specified by a
statute in nonspeech or nonpress terms, a conviction relying upon speech or
press as evidence of violation may be sustained only when the speech or
publication created a "clear and present danger" of attempting or accomplishing
the prohibited crime, e. g., interference with enlistment. The dissents, we
repeat, in emphasizing the value of speech, were addressed to the argument of
the sufficiency of the evidence.
The next important case before the Court in which free speech was the crux of
the conflict was Gitlow v. New York (1925). *** The convictions were sustained,
Justices Holmes and Brandeis dissenting. The majority refused to apply the
"clear and present danger" test to the specific utterance. Its reasoning was as
follows: The "clear and present danger" test was applied to the utterance itself
in Schenck because the question was merely one of sufficiency of evidence
under an admittedly constitutional statute. Gitlow, however, presented a
different question. There a legislature had found that a certain kind of speech
was, itself, harmful and unlawful. The constitutionality of such a state statute
had to be adjudged by this Court just as it determined the constitutionality of
any state statute, namely, whether the statute was "reasonable." Since it was
entirely reasonable for a state to attempt to protect itself from violent overthrow,
the statute was perforce reasonable. The only question remaining in the case
became whether there was evidence to support the conviction, a question which
gave the majority no difficulty. Justices Holmes and Brandeis refused to accept
this approach, but insisted that wherever speech was the evidence of the
violation, it was necessary to show that the speech created the "clear and
present danger" of the substantive evil which the legislature had the right to
prevent. Justices Holmes and Brandeis, then, made no distinction between a
federal statute which made certain acts unlawful, the evidence to support the
conviction being speech, and a statute which made speech itself the crime. This
approach was emphasized in Whitney v. California (1927), where the Court was
confronted with a conviction under the California Criminal Syndicalist statute.
The Court sustained the conviction, Justices Brandeis and Holmes concurring
in the result. In their concurrence they repeated that even though the
legislature had designated certain speech as criminal, this could not prevent
the defendant from showing that there was no danger that the substantive evil
would be brought about.

Robson

47

The First Amendment

Although no case subsequent to Whitney and Gitlow has expressly overruled the
majority opinions in those cases, there is little doubt that subsequent opinions
have inclined toward the Holmes-Brandeis rationale. *** But we further
suggested that neither Justice Holmes nor Justice Brandeis ever envisioned
that a shorthand phrase should be crystallized into a rigid rule to be applied
inflexibly without regard to the circumstances of each case. Speech is not an
absolute, above and beyond control by the legislature when its judgment,
subject to review here, is that certain kinds of speech are so undesirable as to
warrant criminal sanction. Nothing is more certain in modern society than the
principle that there are no absolutes, that a name, a phrase, a standard has
meaning only when associated with the considerations which gave birth to the
nomenclature. To those who would paralyze our Government in the face of
impending threat by encasing it in a semantic straitjacket we must reply that
all concepts are relative.
In this case we are squarely presented with the application of the "clear and
present danger" test, and must decide what that phrase imports. We first note
that many of the cases in which this Court has reversed convictions by use of
this or similar tests have been based on the fact that the interest which the
State was attempting to protect was itself too insubstantial to warrant
restriction of speech. *** Overthrow of the Government by force and violence is
certainly a substantial enough interest for the Government to limit speech.
Indeed, this is the ultimate value of any society, for if a society cannot protect
its very structure from armed internal attack, it must follow that no
subordinate value can be protected. If, then, this interest may be protected, the
literal problem which is presented is what has been meant by the use of the
phrase "clear and present danger" of the utterances bringing about the evil
within the power of Congress to punish.
Obviously, the words cannot mean that before the Government may act, it must
wait until the putsch is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the
signal is awaited. If Government is aware that a group aiming at its overthrow is
attempting to indoctrinate its members and to commit them to a course
whereby they will strike when the leaders feel the circumstances permit, action
by the Government is required. The argument that there is no need for
Government to concern itself, for Government is strong, it possesses ample
powers to put down a rebellion, it may defeat the revolution with ease needs no
answer. For that is not the question. Certainly an attempt to overthrow the
Government by force, even though doomed from the outset because of
inadequate numbers of power of the revolutionists, is a sufficient evil for
Congress to prevent. The damage which such attempts create both physically
and politically to a nation makes it impossible to measure the validity in terms
of the probability of success, or the immediacy of a successful attempt. *** We
must therefore reject the contention that success or probability of success is
the criterion.
The situation with which Justices Holmes and Brandeis were concerned in
Gitlow was a comparatively isolated event, bearing little relation in their minds
to any substantial threat to the safety of the community. *** They were not
confronted with any situation comparable to the instant one—the development

Robson

48

The First Amendment

of an apparatus designed and dedicated to the overthrow of the Government, in
the context of world crisis after crisis.
***It is the existence of the conspiracy which creates the danger. If the
ingredients of the reaction are present, we cannot bind the Government to wait
until the catalyst is added.
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, CONCURRING IN AFFIRMANCE OF THE JUDGMENT.
*** Few questions of comparable import have come before this Court in recent
years. The appellants maintain that they have a right to advocate a political
theory, so long, at least, as their advocacy does not create an immediate danger
of obvious magnitude to the very existence of our present scheme of society. On
the other hand, the Government asserts the right to safeguard the security of
the Nation by such a measure as the Smith Act. Our judgment is thus solicited
on a conflict of interests of the utmost concern to the well-being of the country.
This conflict of interests cannot be resolved by a dogmatic preference for one or
the other, nor by a sonorous formula which is in fact only a euphemistic
disguise for an unresolved conflict. If adjudication is to be a rational process,
we cannot escape a candid examination of the conflicting claims with full
recognition that both are supported by weighty title-deeds.
*** But even the all-embracing power and duty of self-preservation are not
absolute. Like the war power, which is indeed an aspect of the power of selfpreservation, it is subject to applicable constitutional limitations. ***
The First Amendment is such a restriction. It exacts obedience even during
periods of war; it is applicable when war clouds are not figments of the
imagination no less than when they are. The First Amendment categorically
demands that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances." The right of a man to think
what he pleases, to write what he thinks, and to have his thoughts made
available for others to hear or read has an engaging ring of universality. The
Smith Act and this conviction under it no doubt restrict the exercise of free
speech and assembly. Does that, without more, dispose of the matter?
Just as there are those who regard as invulnerable every measure for which the
claim of national survival is invoked, there are those who find in the
Constitution a wholly unfettered right of expression. Such literalness treats the
words of the Constitution as though they were found on a piece of outworn
parchment instead of being words that have called into being a nation with a
past to be preserved for the future. ***
The language of the First Amendment is to be read not as barren words found
in a dictionary but as symbols of historic experience illumined by the
presuppositions of those who employed them. Not what words did Madison and
Hamilton use, but what was it in their minds which they conveyed? Free speech
is subject to prohibition of those abuses of expression which a civilized society

Robson

49

The First Amendment

may forbid. As in the case of every other provision of the Constitution that is
not crystallized by the nature of its technical concepts, the fact that the First
Amendment is not self-defining and self-enforcing neither impairs its usefulness
nor compels its paralysis as a living instrument.
*** The demands of free speech in a democratic society as well as the interest in
national security are better served by candid and informed weighing of the
competing interests, within the confines of the judicial process, than by
announcing dogmas too inflexible for the non-Euclidian problems to be solved.
But how are competing interests to be assessed? Since they are not subject to
quantitative ascertainment, the issue necessarily resolves itself into asking, who
is to make the adjustment?—who is to balance the relevant factors and
ascertain which interest is in the circumstances to prevail? Full responsibility
for the choice cannot be given to the courts. Courts are not representative
bodies. They are not designed to be a good reflex of a democratic society. Their
judgment is best informed, and therefore most dependable, within narrow
limits. Their essential quality is detachment, founded on independence. History
teaches that the independence of the judiciary is jeopardized when courts
become embroiled in the passions of the day and assume primary responsibility
in choosing between competing political, economic and social pressures.
*** But in no case has a majority of this Court held that a legislative judgment,
even as to freedom of utterance, may be overturned merely because the Court
would have made a different choice between the competing interests had the
initial legislative judgment been for it to make.
*** Even though advocacy of overthrow deserves little protection, we should
hesitate to prohibit it if we thereby inhibit the interchange of rational ideas so
essential to representative government and free society.
But there is underlying validity in the distinction between advocacy and the
interchange of ideas, and we do not discard a useful tool because it may be
misused. That such a distinction could be used unreasonably by those in power
against hostile or unorthodox views does not negate the fact that it may be used
reasonably against an organization wielding the power of the centrally
controlled international Communist movement. The object of the conspiracy
before us is so clear that the chance of error in saying that the defendants
conspired to advocate rather than to express ideas is slight. Mr. Justice
Douglas quite properly points out that the conspiracy before us is not a
conspiracy to overthrow the Government. But it would be equally wrong to treat
it as a seminar in political theory.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON, CONCURRING.
*** The Constitution does not make conspiracy a civil right. The Court has
never before done so and I think it should not do so now. Conspiracies of labor
unions, trade associations, and news agencies have been condemned, although
accomplished, evidenced and carried out, like the conspiracy here, chiefly by
letter-writing, meetings, speeches and organization. Indeed, this Court seems,
particularly in cases where the conspiracy has economic ends, to be applying
its doctrines with increasing severity. While I consider criminal conspiracy a
dragnet device capable of perversion into an instrument of injustice in the

Robson

50

The First Amendment

hands of a partisan or complacent judiciary, it has an established place in our
system of law, and no reason appears for applying it only to concerted action
claimed to disturb interstate commerce and withholding it from those claimed
to undermine our whole Government.
*** I do not suggest that Congress could punish conspiracy to advocate
something, the doing of which it may not punish. Advocacy or exposition of the
doctrine of communal property ownership, or any political philosophy
unassociated with advocacy of its imposition by force or seizure of government
by unlawful means could not be reached through conspiracy prosecution. But it
is not forbidden to put down force or violence, it is not forbidden to punish its
teaching or advocacy, and the end being punishable, there is no doubt of the
power to punish conspiracy for the purpose.
*** The law of conspiracy has been the chief means at the Government's
disposal to deal with the growing problems created by such organizations. I
happen to think it is an awkward and inept remedy, but I find no constitutional
authority for taking this weapon from the Government. There is no
constitutional right to "gang up" on the Government.
While I think there was power in Congress to enact this statute and that, as
applied in this case, it cannot be held unconstitutional, I add that I have little
faith in the long-range effectiveness of this conviction to stop the rise of the
Communist movement. Communism will not go to jail with these Communists.
No decision by this Court can forestall revolution whenever the existing
government fails to command the respect and loyalty of the people and
sufficient distress and discontent is allowed to grow up among the masses.
Many failures by fallen governments attest that no government can long prevent
revolution by outlawry. Corruption, ineptitude, inflation, oppressive taxation,
militarization, injustice, and loss of leadership capable of intellectual initiative
in domestic or foreign affairs are allies on which the Communists count to bring
opportunity knocking to their door. Sometimes I think they may be mistaken.
But the Communists are not building just for today—the rest of us might profit
by their example.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, DISSENTING.
*** At the outset I want to emphasize what the crime involved in this case is,
and what it is not. These petitioners were not charged with an attempt to
overthrow the Government. They were not charged with overt acts of any kind
designed to overthrow the Government. They were not even charged with saying
anything or writing anything designed to overthrow the Government. The
charge was that they agreed to assemble and to talk and publish certain ideas
at a later date: The indictment is that they conspired to organize the
Communist Party and to use speech or newspapers and other publications in
the future to teach and advocate the forcible overthrow of the Government. No
matter how it is worded, this is a virulent form of prior censorship of speech
and press, which I believe the First Amendment forbids. I would hold § 3 of the
Smith Act authorizing this prior restraint unconstitutional on its face and as
applied.

Robson

51

The First Amendment

***The opinions for affirmance indicate that the chief reason for jettisoning the
rule is the expressed fear that advocacy of Communist doctrine endangers the
safety of the Republic. Undoubtedly, a governmental policy of unfettered
communication of ideas does entail dangers. To the Founders of this Nation,
however, the benefits derived from free expression were worth the risk. They
embodied this philosophy in the First Amendment's command that "Congress
shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press . . . ." I
have always believed that the First Amendment is the keystone of our
Government, that the freedoms it guarantees provide the best insurance against
destruction of all freedom. At least as to speech in the realm of public matters, I
believe that the "clear and present danger" test does not "mark the furthermost
constitutional boundaries of protected expression" but does "no more than
recognize a minimum compulsion of the Bill of Rights." Bridges v. California.
So long as this Court exercises the power of judicial review of legislation, I
cannot agree that the First Amendment permits us to sustain laws suppressing
freedom of speech and press on the basis of Congress' or our own notions of
mere "reasonableness." Such a doctrine waters down the First Amendment so
that it amounts to little more than an admonition to Congress. The Amendment
as so construed is not likely to protect any but those "safe" or orthodox views
which rarely need its protection. ***
Public opinion being what it now is, few will protest the conviction of these
Communist petitioners. There is hope, however, that in calmer times, when
present pressures, passions and fears subside, this or some later Court will
restore the First Amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they
belong in a free society.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, DISSENTING.
If this were a case where those who claimed protection under the First
Amendment were teaching the techniques of sabotage, the assassination of the
President, the filching of documents from public files, the planting of bombs,
the art of street warfare, and the like, I would have no doubts. The freedom to
speak is not absolute; the teaching of methods of terror and other seditious
conduct should be beyond the pale along with obscenity and immorality. This
case was argued as if those were the facts. The argument imported much
seditious conduct into the record. That is easy and it has popular appeal, for
the activities of Communists in plotting and scheming against the free world are
common knowledge. But the fact is that no such evidence was introduced at the
trial. There is a statute which makes a seditious conspiracy unlawful.
Petitioners, however, were not charged with a "conspiracy to overthrow" the
Government. They were charged with a conspiracy to form a party and groups
and assemblies of people who teach and advocate the overthrow of our
Government by force or violence and with a conspiracy to advocate and teach
its overthrow by force and violence. It may well be that indoctrination in the
techniques of terror to destroy the Government would be indictable under either
statute. But the teaching which is condemned here is of a different character.
So far as the present record is concerned, what petitioners did was to organize
people to teach and themselves teach the Marxist-Leninist doctrine contained

Robson

52

The First Amendment

chiefly in four books: STALIN, FOUNDATIONS OF LENINISM (1924); MARX AND
ENGELS, MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY (1848); LENIN, THE STATE AND
REVOLUTION (1917); HISTORY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE SOVIET UNION
(1939).
Those books are to Soviet Communism what MEIN KAMPF was to Nazism. If they
are understood, the ugliness of Communism is revealed, its deceit and cunning
are exposed, the nature of its activities becomes apparent, and the chances of
its success less likely. That is not, of course, the reason why petitioners chose
these books for their classrooms. They are fervent Communists to whom these
volumes are gospel. They preached the creed with the hope that some day it
would be acted upon.
The opinion of the Court does not outlaw these texts nor condemn them to the
fire, as the Communists do literature offensive to their creed. But if the books
themselves are not outlawed, if they can lawfully remain on library shelves, by
what reasoning does their use in a classroom become a crime? It would not be a
crime under the Act to introduce these books to a class, though that would be
teaching what the creed of violent overthrow of the Government is. The Act, as
construed, requires the element of intent—that those who teach the creed
believe in it. The crime then depends not on what is taught but on who the
teacher is. That is to make freedom of speech turn not on what is said, but on
the intent with which it is said. Once we start down that road we enter territory
dangerous to the liberties of every citizen.
*** There comes a time when even speech loses its constitutional immunity.
Speech innocuous one year may at another time fan such destructive flames
that it must be halted in the interests of the safety of the Republic. That is the
meaning of the clear and present danger test. When conditions are so critical
that there will be no time to avoid the evil that the speech threatens, it is time
to call a halt. Otherwise, free speech which is the strength of the Nation will be
the cause of its destruction.
Yet free speech is the rule, not the exception. The restraint to be constitutional
must be based on more than fear, on more than passionate opposition against
the speech, on more than a revolted dislike for its contents. There must be
some immediate injury to society that is likely if speech is allowed. The classic
statement of these conditions was made by Mr. Justice Brandeis in his
concurring opinion in Whitney v. California ***.
I had assumed that the question of the clear and present danger, being so
critical an issue in the case, would be a matter for submission to the jury. ***
Yet, whether the question is one for the Court or the jury, there should be
evidence of record on the issue. This record, however, contains no evidence
whatsoever showing that the acts charged, viz., the teaching of the Soviet theory
of revolution with the hope that it will be realized, have created any clear and
present danger to the Nation. The Court, however, rules to the contrary. ***
The nature of Communism as a force on the world scene would, of course, be
relevant to the issue of clear and present danger of petitioners' advocacy within
the United States. But the primary consideration is the strength and tactical
position of petitioners and their converts in this country. On that there is no

Robson

53

The First Amendment

evidence in the record. If we are to take judicial notice of the threat of
Communists within the nation, it should not be difficult to conclude that as a
political party they are of little consequence. Communists in this country have
never made a respectable or serious showing in any election. I would doubt that
there is a village, let alone a city or county or state, which the Communists
could carry. Communism in the world scene is no bogeyman; but Communism
as a political faction or party in this country plainly is. Communism has been
so thoroughly exposed in this country that it has been crippled as a political
force. Free speech has destroyed it as an effective political party. It is
inconceivable that those who went up and down this country preaching the
doctrine of revolution which petitioners espouse would have any success. In
days of trouble and confusion, when bread lines were long, when the
unemployed walked the streets, when people were starving, the advocates of a
short-cut by revolution might have a chance to gain adherents. But today there
are no such conditions. The country is not in despair; the people know Soviet
Communism; the doctrine of Soviet revolution is exposed in all of its ugliness
and the American people want none of it.
How it can be said that there is a clear and present danger that this advocacy
will succeed is, therefore, a mystery. Some nations less resilient than the United
States, where illiteracy is high and where democratic traditions are only
budding, might have to take drastic steps and jail these men for merely
speaking their creed. But in America they are miserable merchants of unwanted
ideas; their wares remain unsold. The fact that their ideas are abhorrent does
not make them powerful.
The political impotence of the Communists in this country does not, of course,
dispose of the problem. Their numbers; their positions in industry and
government; the extent to which they have in fact infiltrated the police, the
armed services, transportation, stevedoring, power plants, munitions works,
and other critical places—these facts all bear on the likelihood that their
advocacy of the Soviet theory of revolution will endanger the Republic. But the
record is silent on these facts. If we are to proceed on the basis of judicial
notice, it is impossible for me to say that the Communists in this country are so
potent or so strategically deployed that they must be suppressed for their
speech. I could not so hold unless I were willing to conclude that the activities
in recent years of committees of Congress, of the Attorney General, of labor
unions, of state legislatures, and of Loyalty Boards were so futile as to leave the
country on the edge of grave peril. To believe that petitioners and their following
are placed in such critical positions as to endanger the Nation is to believe the
incredible. It is safe to say that the followers of the creed of Soviet Communism
are known to the F. B. I.; that in case of war with Russia they will be picked up
overnight as were all prospective saboteurs at the commencement of World War
II; that the invisible army of petitioners is the best known, the most beset, and
the least thriving of any fifth column in history. Only those held by fear and
panic could think otherwise.
*** The First Amendment provides that "Congress shall make no law . . .
abridging the freedom of speech." The Constitution provides no exception. This
does not mean, however, that the Nation need hold its hand until it is in such
weakened condition that there is no time to protect itself from incitement to

Robson

54

The First Amendment

revolution. Seditious conduct can always be punished. But the command of the
First Amendment is so clear that we should not allow Congress to call a halt to
free speech except in the extreme case of peril from the speech itself. The First
Amendment makes confidence in the common sense of our people and in their
maturity of judgment the great postulate of our democracy. Its philosophy is
that violence is rarely, if ever, stopped by denying civil liberties to those
advocating resort to force. The First Amendment reflects the philosophy of
Jefferson "that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government,
for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against
peace and good order." The political censor has no place in our public debates.
Unless and until extreme and necessitous circumstances are shown, our aim
should be to keep speech unfettered and to allow the processes of law to be
invoked only when the provocateurs among us move from speech to action.

III.	  “Offensive”	  Speech	  
Chaplinsky	  v.	  New	  Hampshire	  
315 U.S. 568 (1942)

MR. JUSTICE MURPHY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE [UNANIMOUS] COURT.
Appellant, a member of the sect known as Jehovah's Witnesses, was convicted
in the municipal court of Rochester, New Hampshire, for violation of Chapter
378, § 2, of the Public Laws of New Hampshire:
No person shall address any offensive, derisive or annoying word to any other
person who is lawfully in any street or other public place, nor call him by any
offensive or derisive name, nor make any noise or exclamation in his presence
and hearing with intent to deride, offend or annoy him, or to prevent him from
pursuing his lawful business or occupation.

The complaint charged that appellant,
with force and arms, in a certain public place in said city of Rochester, to-wit, on
the public sidewalk on the easterly side of Wakefield Street, near unto the

Robson

55

The First Amendment

entrance of the City Hall, did unlawfully repeat the words following, addressed to
the complainant, that is to say, "You are a God damned racketeer" and "a
damned Fascist and the whole government of Rochester are Fascists or agents of
Fascists," the same being offensive, derisive and annoying words and names.

There is no substantial dispute over the facts. Chaplinsky was distributing the
literature of his sect on the streets of Rochester on a busy Saturday afternoon.
Members of the local citizenry complained to the City Marshal, Bowering, that
Chaplinsky was denouncing all religion as a "racket." Bowering told them that
Chaplinsky was lawfully engaged, and then warned Chaplinsky that the crowd
was getting restless. Some time later, a disturbance occurred and the traffic
officer on duty at the busy intersection started with Chaplinsky for the police
station, but did not inform him that he was under arrest or that he was going to
be arrested. On the way, they encountered Marshal Bowering, who had been
advised that a riot was under way and was therefore hurrying to the scene.
Bowering repeated his earlier warning to Chaplinsky, who then addressed to
Bowering the words set forth in the complaint.
Chaplinsky's version of the affair was slightly different. He testified that, when
he met Bowering, he asked him to arrest the ones responsible for the
disturbance. In reply, Bowering cursed him and told him to come along.
Appellant admitted that he said the words charged in the complaint, with the
exception of the name of the Deity.
It is now clear that “Freedom of speech and freedom of the press, which are
protected by the First Amendment from infringement by Congress, are among
the fundamental personal rights and liberties which are protected by the
Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action.”
Allowing the broadest scope to the language and purpose of the Fourteenth
Amendment, it is well understood that the right of free speech is not absolute at
all times and under all circumstances. There are certain well defined and
narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which
have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the
lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or "fighting"
words -- those which, by their very utterance, inflict injury or tend to incite an
immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances
are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social
value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is
clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.
Resort to epithets or personal abuse is not in any proper sense
communication of information or opinion safeguarded by the
Constitution, and its punishment as a criminal act would raise no
question under that instrument.
Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940).
We are unable to say that the limited scope of the statute as thus construed [by
the New Hampshire Supreme Court] contravenes the Constitutional right of free
expression. It is a statute narrowly drawn and limited to define and punish
specific conduct lying within the domain of state power, the use in a public
place of words likely to cause a breach of the peace.
This conclusion
necessarily disposes of appellant's contention that the statute is so vague and

Robson

56

The First Amendment

indefinite as to render a conviction thereunder a violation of due process. A
statute punishing verbal acts, carefully drawn so as not unduly to impair
liberty of expression, is not too vague for a criminal law.
Nor can we say that the application of the statute to the facts disclosed by the
record substantially or unreasonably impinges upon the privilege of free speech.
Argument is unnecessary to demonstrate that the appellations "damned
racketeer" and "damned Fascist" are epithets likely to provoke the average
person to retaliation, and thereby cause a breach of the peace.
The refusal of the state court to admit evidence of provocation and evidence
bearing on the truth or falsity of the utterances is open to no Constitutional
objection. Whether the facts sought to be proved by such evidence constitute a
defense to the charge, or may be shown in mitigation, are questions for the
state court to determine. Our function is fulfilled by a determination that the
challenged statute, on its face and as applied, does not contravene the
Fourteenth Amendment.
Affirmed.

Cohen	  v.	  California	  
403 U.S. 15 (1971)

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT. JUSTICE BLACKMUN FILED A
DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH THE CHIEF JUSTICE [BURGER] AND JUSTICE BLACK JOINED.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
This case may seem at first blush too inconsequential to find its way into our
books, but the issue it presents is of no small constitutional significance.
Appellant Paul Robert Cohen was convicted in the Los Angeles Municipal Court
of violating that part of California Penal Code § 415 which prohibits
"maliciously and willfully disturb[ing] the peace or quiet of any neighborhood or
person . . . by . . . offensive conduct. . . ." He was given 30 days' imprisonment.
The facts upon which his conviction rests are detailed in the opinion of the
Court of Appeal of California, Second Appellate District, as follows:
"On April 26, 1968, the defendant was observed in the Los Angeles County
Courthouse in the corridor outside of division 20 of the municipal court wearing
a jacket bearing the words `Fuck the Draft' which were plainly visible. There
were women and children present in the corridor. The defendant was arrested.
The defendant testified that he wore the jacket knowing that the words were on
the jacket as a means of informing the public of the depth of his feelings against
the Vietnam War and the draft.
"The defendant did not engage in, nor threaten to engage in, nor did anyone as
the result of his conduct in fact commit or threaten to commit any act of
violence. The defendant did not make any loud or unusual noise, nor was there
any evidence that he uttered any sound prior to his arrest."

Robson

57

The First Amendment

In affirming the conviction the Court of Appeal held that "offensive conduct"
means "behavior which has a tendency to provoke others to acts of violence or
to in turn disturb the peace," and that the State had proved this element
because, on the facts of this case, "[i]t was certainly reasonably foreseeable that
such conduct might cause others to rise up to commit a violent act against the
person of the defendant or attempt to forceably remove his jacket." The
California Supreme Court declined review by a divided vote. We brought the
case here ***. We now reverse. ***
I
In order to lay hands on the precise issue which this case involves, it is useful
first to canvass various matters which this record does not present.
The conviction quite clearly rests upon the asserted offensiveness of the words
Cohen used to convey his message to the public. The only "conduct" which the
State sought to punish is the fact of communication. Thus, we deal here with a
conviction resting solely upon "speech," not upon any separately identifiable
conduct which allegedly was intended by Cohen to be perceived by others as
expressive of particular views but which, on its face, does not necessarily
convey any message and hence arguably could be regulated without effectively
repressing Cohen's ability to express himself. Further, the State certainly lacks
power to punish Cohen for the underlying content of the message the
inscription conveyed. At least so long as there is no showing of an intent to
incite disobedience to or disruption of the draft, Cohen could not, consistently
with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, be punished for asserting the
evident position on the inutility or immorality of the draft his jacket reflected.
Appellant's conviction, then, rests squarely upon his exercise of the "freedom of
speech" protected from arbitrary governmental interference by the Constitution
and can be justified, if at all, only as a valid regulation of the manner in which
he exercised that freedom, not as a permissible prohibition on the substantive
message it conveys. This does not end the inquiry, of course, for the First and
Fourteenth Amendments have never been thought to give absolute protection to
every individual to speak whenever or wherever he pleases, or to use any form
of address in any circumstances that he chooses. In this vein, too, however, we
think it important to note that several issues typically associated with such
problems are not presented here.
In the first place, Cohen was tried under a statute applicable throughout the
entire State. Any attempt to support this conviction on the ground that the
statute seeks to preserve an appropriately decorous atmosphere in the
courthouse where Cohen was arrested must fail in the absence of any language
in the statute that would have put appellant on notice that certain kinds of
otherwise permissible speech or conduct would nevertheless, under California
law, not be tolerated in certain places. No fair reading of the phrase "offensive
conduct" can be said sufficiently to inform the ordinary person that distinctions
between certain locations are thereby created.

Robson

58

The First Amendment

In the second place, as it comes to us, this case cannot be said to fall within
those relatively few categories of instances where prior decisions have
established the power of government to deal more comprehensively with certain
forms of individual expression simply upon a showing that such a form was
employed. This is not, for example, an obscenity case. Whatever else may be
necessary to give rise to the States' broader power to prohibit obscene
expression, such expression must be, in some significant way, erotic. It cannot
plausibly be maintained that this vulgar allusion to the Selective Service System
would conjure up such psychic stimulation in anyone likely to be confronted
with Cohen's crudely defaced jacket.
This Court has also held that the States are free to ban the simple use, without
a demonstration of additional justifying circumstances, of so-called "fighting
words," those personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to the
ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to
provoke violent reaction. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942). While the fourletter word displayed by Cohen in relation to the draft is not uncommonly
employed in a personally provocative fashion, in this instance it was clearly not
"directed to the person of the hearer." Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940). No
individual actually or likely to be present could reasonably have regarded the
words on appellant's jacket as a direct personal insult. Nor do we have here an
instance of the exercise of the State's police power to prevent a speaker from
intentionally provoking a given group to hostile reaction. There is, as noted
above, no showing that anyone who saw Cohen was in fact violently aroused or
that appellant intended such a result.
Finally, in arguments before this Court much has been made of the claim that
Cohen's distasteful mode of expression was thrust upon unwilling or
unsuspecting viewers, and that the State might therefore legitimately act as it
did in order to protect the sensitive from otherwise unavoidable exposure to
appellant's crude form of protest. Of course, the mere presumed presence of
unwitting listeners or viewers does not serve automatically to justify curtailing
all speech capable of giving offense. While this Court has recognized that
government may properly act in many situations to prohibit intrusion into the
privacy of the home of unwelcome views and ideas which cannot be totally
banned from the public dialogue, we have at the same time consistently
stressed that "we are often `captives' outside the sanctuary of the home and
subject to objectionable speech." The ability of government, consonant with the
Constitution, to shut off discourse solely to protect others from hearing it is, in
other words, dependent upon a showing that substantial privacy interests are
being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner. Any broader view of this
authority would effectively empower a majority to silence dissidents simply as a
matter of personal predilections.
In this regard, persons confronted with Cohen's jacket were in a quite different
posture than, say, those subjected to the raucous emissions of sound trucks
blaring outside their residences. Those in the Los Angeles courthouse could
effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities simply by averting
their eyes. And, while it may be that one has a more substantial claim to a

Robson

59

The First Amendment

recognizable privacy interest when walking through a courthouse corridor than,
for example, strolling through Central Park, surely it is nothing like the interest
in being free from unwanted expression in the confines of one's own home.
Given the subtlety and complexity of the factors involved, if Cohen's "speech"
was otherwise entitled to constitutional protection, we do not think the fact that
some unwilling "listeners" in a public building may have been briefly exposed to
it can serve to justify this breach of the peace conviction where, as here, there
was no evidence that persons powerless to avoid appellant's conduct did in fact
object to it, and where that portion of the statute upon which Cohen's
conviction rests evinces no concern, either on its face or as construed by the
California courts, with the special plight of the captive auditor, but, instead,
indiscriminately sweeps within its prohibitions all "offensive conduct" that
disturbs "any neighborhood or person."
II
Against this background, the issue flushed by this case stands out in bold relief.
It is whether California can excise, as "offensive conduct," one particular
scurrilous epithet from the public discourse, either upon the theory of the court
below that its use is inherently likely to cause violent reaction or upon a more
general assertion that the States, acting as guardians of public morality, may
properly remove this offensive word from the public vocabulary.
The rationale of the California court is plainly untenable. At most it reflects an
"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance [which] is not enough to
overcome the right to freedom of expression." Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.
Community School Dist. (1969). We have been shown no evidence that
substantial numbers of citizens are standing ready to strike out physically at
whoever may assault their sensibilities with execrations like that uttered by
Cohen. There may be some persons about with such lawless and violent
proclivities, but that is an insufficient base upon which to erect, consistently
with constitutional values, a governmental power to force persons who wish to
ventilate their dissident views into avoiding particular forms of expression. The
argument amounts to little more than the self-defeating proposition that to
avoid physical censorship of one who has not sought to provoke such a
response by a hypothetical coterie of the violent and lawless, the States may
more appropriately effectuate that censorship themselves.
Admittedly, it is not so obvious that the First and Fourteenth Amendments
must be taken to disable the States from punishing public utterance of this
unseemly expletive in order to maintain what they regard as a suitable level of
discourse within the body politic. We think, however, that examination and
reflection will reveal the shortcomings of a contrary viewpoint.
At the outset, we cannot overemphasize that, in our judgment, most situations
where the State has a justifiable interest in regulating speech will fall within
one or more of the various established exceptions, discussed above but not
applicable here, to the usual rule that governmental bodies may not prescribe
the form or content of individual expression. Equally important to our
conclusion is the constitutional backdrop against which our decision must be

Robson

60

The First Amendment

made. The constitutional right of free expression is powerful medicine in a
society as diverse and populous as ours. It is designed and intended to remove
governmental restraints from the arena of public discussion, putting the
decision as to what views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us, in
the hope that use of such freedom will ultimately produce a more capable
citizenry and more perfect polity and in the belief that no other approach would
comport with the premise of individual dignity and choice upon which our
political system rests. See Whitney v. California (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring).
To many, the immediate consequence of this freedom may often appear to be
only verbal tumult, discord, and even offensive utterance. These are, however,
within established limits, in truth necessary side effects of the broader enduring
values which the process of open debate permits us to achieve. That the air may
at times seem filled with verbal cacophony is, in this sense not a sign of
weakness but of strength. We cannot lose sight of the fact that, in what
otherwise might seem a trifling and annoying instance of individual distasteful
abuse of a privilege, these fundamental societal values are truly implicated.
That is why "[w]holly neutral futilities . . . come under the protection of free
speech as fully as do Keats' poems or Donne's sermons," and why "so long as
the means are peaceful, the communication need not meet standards of
acceptability."
Against this perception of the constitutional policies involved, we discern
certain more particularized considerations that peculiarly call for reversal of
this conviction. First, the principle contended for by the State seems inherently
boundless. How is one to distinguish this from any other offensive word? Surely
the State has no right to cleanse public debate to the point where it is
grammatically palatable to the most squeamish among us. Yet no readily
ascertainable general principle exists for stopping short of that result were we
to affirm the judgment below. For, while the particular four-letter word being
litigated here is perhaps more distasteful than most others of its genre, it is
nevertheless often true that one man's vulgarity is another's lyric. Indeed, we
think it is largely because governmental officials cannot make principled
distinctions in this area that the Constitution leaves matters of taste and style
so largely to the individual.
Additionally, we cannot overlook the fact, because it is well illustrated by the
episode involved here, that much linguistic expression serves a dual
communicative function: it conveys not only ideas capable of relatively precise,
detached explication, but otherwise inexpressible emotions as well. In fact,
words are often chosen as much for their emotive as their cognitive force. We
cannot sanction the view that the Constitution, while solicitous of the cognitive
content of individual speech, has little or no regard for that emotive function
which, practically speaking, may often be the more important element of the
overall message sought to be communicated. ***
Finally, and in the same vein, we cannot indulge the facile assumption that one
can forbid particular words without also running a substantial risk of
suppressing ideas in the process. Indeed, governments might soon seize upon

Robson

61

The First Amendment

the censorship of particular words as a convenient guise for banning the
expression of unpopular views. We have been able, as noted above, to discern
little social benefit that might result from running the risk of opening the door
to such grave results.
It is, in sum, our judgment that, absent a more particularized and compelling
reason for its actions, the State may not, consistently with the First and
Fourteenth Amendments, make the simple public display here involved of this
single four-letter expletive a criminal offense. Because that is the only arguably
sustainable rationale for the conviction here at issue, the judgment below must
be
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE [BURGER] AND MR. JUSTICE
BLACK JOIN, DISSENTING.
I dissent, and I do so for two reasons:
Cohen's absurd and immature antic, in my view, was mainly conduct and little
speech. *** Further, the case appears to me to be well within the sphere of
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942), where Mr. Justice Murphy, a known
champion of First Amendment freedoms, wrote for a unanimous bench. As a
consequence, this Court's agonizing over First Amendment values seems
misplaced and unnecessary.
[The second reason concerns the Court’s “jurisdiction” over the constitutional
question].
[MR. JUSTICE WHITE, DISSENTING OPINION, discussing the second reason, omitted].

Notes	  
1.
The exclusion of certain types of speech as unprotected by the
First Amendment is often described as the “categorical” approach.
Consider the categories of speech that the Court excludes from First
Amendment consideration. What is the First Amendment doctrine that
develops for those categories? Is it operative in the next cases?
2.
Why does the Court reject the “appropriately decorous atmosphere
in the courthouse” for sustaining Cohen’s conviction?

Brandenburg	  v.	  Ohio	  
395 U.S. 444 (1969)

PER CURIAM OPINION FOR THE COURT. JUSTICE DOUGLAS AND JUSTICE BLACK FILED
CONCURRING OPINIONS.

PER CURIAM OPINION FOR THE COURT.
The appellant, a leader of a Ku Klux Klan group, was convicted under the Ohio
Criminal Syndicalism statute for "advocat[ing] . . . the duty, necessity, or
propriety of crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism as a
means of accomplishing industrial or political reform" and for "voluntarily
assembl[ing] with any society, group, or assemblage of persons formed to teach
or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism." Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §
2923.13. He was fined $1,000 and sentenced to one to 10 years' imprisonment.
The appellant challenged the constitutionality of the criminal syndicalism
statute under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution, but the intermediate appellate court of Ohio affirmed his
conviction without opinion. The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed his appeal,
sua sponte, "for the reason that no substantial constitutional question exists
herein." It did not file an opinion or explain its conclusions. Appeal was taken to
this Court, and we noted probable jurisdiction. We reverse.
The record shows that a man, identified at trial as the appellant, telephoned an
announcer-reporter on the staff of a Cincinnati television station and invited
him to come to a Ku Klux Klan "rally" to be held at a farm in Hamilton County.
With the cooperation of the organizers, the reporter and a cameraman attended
the meeting and filmed the events. Portions of the films were later broadcast on
the local station and on a national network.
The prosecution's case rested on the films and on testimony identifying the
appellant as the person who communicated with the reporter and who spoke at
the rally. The State also introduced into evidence several articles appearing in
the film, including a pistol, a rifle, a shotgun, ammunition, a Bible, and a red
hood worn by the speaker in the films.
One film showed 12 hooded figures, some of whom carried firearms. They were
gathered around a large wooden cross, which they burned. No one was present
other than the participants and the newsmen who made the film. Most of the
words uttered during the scene were incomprehensible when the film was
projected, but scattered phrases could be understood that were derogatory of
Negroes and, in one instance, of Jews. Another scene on the same film showed
the appellant, in Klan regalia, making a speech. The speech, in full, was as
follows:

Robson

63

The First Amendment

"This is an organizers' meeting. We have had quite a few members here today
which are—we have hundreds, hundreds of members throughout the State of
Ohio. I can quote from a newspaper clipping from the Columbus, Ohio Dispatch,
five weeks ago Sunday morning. The Klan has more members in the State of
Ohio than does any other organization. We're not a revengent organization, but
if our President, our Congress, our Supreme Court, continues to suppress the
white, Caucasian race, it's possible that there might have to be some
revengeance taken.
"We are marching on Congress July the Fourth, four hundred thousand strong.
From there we are dividing into two groups, one group to march on St.
Augustine, Florida, the other group to march into Mississippi. Thank you."

The second film showed six hooded figures one of whom, later identified as the
appellant, repeated a speech very similar to that recorded on the first film. The
reference to the possibility of "revengeance" was omitted, and one sentence was
added: "Personally, I believe the nigger should be returned to Africa, the Jew
returned to Israel." Though some of the figures in the films carried weapons, the
speaker did not.
The Ohio Criminal Syndicalism Statute was enacted in 1919. From 1917 to
1920, identical or quite similar laws were adopted by 20 States and two
territories. In 1927, this Court sustained the constitutionality of California's
Criminal Syndicalism Act, the text of which is quite similar to that of the laws of
Ohio. Whitney v. California (1927). The Court upheld the statute on the ground
that, without more, "advocating" violent means to effect political and economic
change involves such danger to the security of the State that the State may
outlaw it. But Whitney has been thoroughly discredited by later decisions. See
Dennis v. United States (1951). These later decisions have fashioned the
principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not
permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law
violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. As we
said in Noto v. United States (1961), "the mere abstract teaching . . . of the moral
propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence, is not the
same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action." A
statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly intrudes upon the
freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. It sweeps
within its condemnation speech which our Constitution has immunized from
governmental control.
Measured by this test, Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act cannot be sustained.
The Act punishes persons who "advocate or teach the duty, necessity, or
propriety" of violence "as a means of accomplishing industrial or political
reform"; or who publish or circulate or display any book or paper containing
such advocacy; or who "justify" the commission of violent acts "with intent to
exemplify, spread or advocate the propriety of the doctrines of criminal
syndicalism"; or who "voluntarily assemble" with a group formed "to teach or
advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism." Neither the indictment nor the
trial judge's instructions to the jury in any way refined the statute's bald

Robson

The First Amendment

definition of the crime in terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from
incitement to imminent lawless action.
Accordingly, we are here confronted with a statute which, by its own words and
as applied, purports to punish mere advocacy and to forbid, on pain of criminal
punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the described type of
action. Such a statute falls within the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. The contrary teaching of Whitney v. California, cannot be
supported, and that decision is therefore overruled.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, CONCURRING.
While I join the opinion of the Court, I desire to enter a caveat.
The "clear and present danger" test was adumbrated by Mr. Justice Holmes in a
case arising during World War I—a war "declared" by the Congress, not by the
Chief Executive. The case was Schenck v. United States, where the defendant
was charged with attempts to cause insubordination in the military and
obstruction of enlistment. * * * *
Though I doubt if the "clear and present danger" test is congenial to the First
Amendment in time of a declared war, I am certain it is not reconcilable with
the First Amendment in days of peace.
The Court quite properly overrules Whitney v. California, which involved
advocacy of ideas which the majority of the Court deemed unsound and
dangerous.
Mr. Justice Holmes, though never formally abandoning the "clear and present
danger" test, moved closer to the First Amendment ideal * * * in dissent in
Gitlow v.New York. * * * *
We have never been faithful to the philosophy of that dissent.
* * * * My own view is quite different. I see no place in the regime of the First
Amendment for any "clear and present danger" test, whether strict and tight as
some would make it, or free-wheeling as the Court in Dennis rephrased it.

Hess	  v.	  Indiana	  

414 U.S. 105 (1973)

PER CURIAM OPINION FOR THE COURT. JUSTICE REHNQUIST FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN
WHICH THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND JUSTICE BLACKMUN JOINED.

PER CURIAM OPINION FOR THE COURT.
Gregory Hess appeals from his conviction in the Indiana courts for violating the
State's disorderly conduct statute. Appellant contends that his conviction
should be reversed because the statute is unconstitutionally vague, because the
statute is overbroad in that it forbids activity that is protected under the First
and Fourteenth Amendments, and because the statute, as applied here,
abridged his constitutionally protected freedom of speech, These contentions
were rejected in the City Court, where Hess was convicted, and in the Superior
Court, which reviewed his conviction. The Supreme Court of Indiana, with one
dissent, considered and rejected each of Hess' constitutional contentions, and
accordingly affirmed his conviction.
The events leading to Hess' conviction began with an antiwar demonstration on
the campus of Indiana University. In the course of the demonstration,
approximately 100 to 150 of the demonstrators moved onto a public street and
blocked the passage of vehicles. When the demonstrators did not respond to
verbal directions from the sheriff to clear the street, the sheriff and his deputies
began walking up the street, and the demonstrators in their path moved to the
curbs on either side, joining a large number of spectators who had gathered.
Hess was standing off the street as the sheriff passed him. The sheriff heard
Hess utter the word "fuck" in what he later described as a loud voice and
immediately arrested him on the disorderly conduct charge. It was later
stipulated that what appellant had said was "We'll take the fucking street later,"
or "We'll take the fucking street again." Two witnesses who were in the
immediate vicinity testified, apparently without contradiction, that they heard
Hess' words and witnessed his arrest. They indicated that Hess did not appear
to be exhorting the crowd to go back into the street, that he was facing the
crowd and not the street when he uttered the statement, that his statement did
not appear to be addressed to any particular person or group, and that his
tone, although loud, was no louder than that of the other people in the area.
Indiana's disorderly conduct statute was applied in this case to punish only
spoken words. It hardly needs repeating that "[t]he constitutional guarantees of
freedom of speech forbid the States to punish the use of words or language not
within `narrowly limited classes of speech.'" The words here did not fall within
any of these "limited classes." In the first place, it is clear that the Indiana court
specifically abjured any suggestion that Hess' words could be punished as
obscene.*** Indeed, after Cohen v. California (1971) such a contention with
regard to the language at issue would not be tenable. By the same token, any
suggestion that Hess' speech amounted to "fighting words," Chaplinsky v. New
Hampshire (1942), could not withstand scrutiny. Even if under other
circumstances this language could be regarded as a personal insult, the
evidence is undisputed that Hess' statement was not directed to any person or

Robson

66

The First Amendment

group in particular. Although the sheriff testified that he was offended by the
language, he also stated that he did not interpret the expression as being
directed personally at him, and the evidence is clear that appellant had his
back to the sheriff at the time. Thus, under our decisions, the State could not
punish this speech as "fighting words."
*** The Indiana Supreme Court placed primary reliance on the trial court's
finding that Hess' statement "was intended to incite further lawless action on
the part of the crowd in the vicinity of appellant and was likely to produce such
action." At best, however, the statement could be taken as counsel for present
moderation; at worst, it amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal
action at some indefinite future time. This is not sufficient to permit the State to
punish Hess' speech. Under our decisions, "the constitutional guarantees of free
speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of
the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to
inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce
such action." Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969). (Emphasis added.) Since the
uncontroverted evidence showed that Hess' statement was not directed to any
person or group of persons, it cannot be said that he was advocating, in the
normal sense, any action. And since there was no evidence, or rational
inference from the import of the language, that his words were intended to
produce, and likely to produce, imminent disorder, those words could not be
punished by the State on the ground that they had "a `tendency to lead to
violence.'
Accordingly, the motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted and the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana is reversed.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND MR. JUSTICE
BLACKMUN JOIN, DISSENTING.
The Court's per curiam opinion rendered today aptly demonstrates the
difficulties inherent in substituting a different complex of factual inferences for
the inferences reached by the courts below. Since it is not clear to me that the
Court has a sufficient basis for its action, I dissent.
It should be noted at the outset that the case was tried de novo in the Superior
Court of Indiana upon a stipulated set of facts, and, therefore, the record is
perhaps unusually colorless and devoid of life. Nevertheless, certain facts are
clearly established. Appellant was arrested during the course of an antiwar
demonstration conducted at Indiana University in May 1970. The
demonstration was of sufficient size and vigor to require the summoning of
police, and both the Sheriff's Department and the Bloomington Police
Department were asked to help university officials and police remove
demonstrators blocking doorways to a campus building. At the time the sheriff
arrived, "approximately 200-300 persons" were assembled at that particular
building.
The doorways eventually were cleared of demonstrators, but, in the process, two
students were placed under arrest. This action did not go unnoticed by the
demonstrators. As the stipulation notes, "[i]n apparent response to these

Robson

67

The First Amendment

arrests, about 100-150 of the persons who had gathered as spectators went
into Indiana Avenue in front of Bryan Hall and in front of the patrol car in
which the two arrestees had been placed." Thus, by contrast to the majority's
somewhat antiseptic description of this massing as being "[i]n the course of the
demonstration," the demonstrators' presence in the street was not part of the
normal "course of the demonstration" but could reasonably be construed as an
attempt to intimidate and impede the arresting officers. Furthermore, as the
stipulation also notes, the demonstrators "did not respond to verbal directions"
from the sheriff to clear the street. Thus, the sheriff and his deputies found it
necessary to disperse demonstrators by walking up the street directly into their
path. Only at that point did the demonstrators move to the curbs.
The stipulation contains only one other declaration of fact: that Sheriff Thrasher
arrested the appellant, Gregory Hess, for disorderly conduct. The remainder of
the stipulation merely summarizes testimony, particularly the testimony of
Sheriff Thrasher, two female witnesses (both students at Indiana University)
who were apparently part of the crowd, and Dr. Owen Thomas, a professor of
English at the university. The only "established" facts which emerge from these
summaries are that "Hess was standing off the street on the eastern curb of
Indiana Avenue" and that he said, in the words of the trial court, "We'll take the
fucking street later (or again)." The two female witnesses testified, as the
majority correctly observes, that they were not offended by Hess' statement,
that it was said no louder than statements by other demonstrators, "that Hess
did not appear to be exhorting the crowd to go back into the street," that he was
facing the crowd, and "that his statement did not appear to be addressed to any
particular person or group." (Emphasis added.)
The majority makes much of this "uncontroverted evidence," but I am unable to
find anywhere in the opinion an explanation of why it must be believed. Surely
the sentence "We'll take the fucking street later (or again)" is susceptible of
characterization as an exhortation, particularly when uttered in a loud voice
while facing a crowd. The opinions of two defense witnesses cannot be
considered proof to the contrary, since the trial court was perfectly free to reject
this testimony if it so desired. Perhaps, as these witnesses and the majority
opinion seem to suggest, appellant was simply expressing his views to the world
at large, but that is surely not the only rational explanation.
The majority also places great emphasis on appellant's use of the word "later,"
even suggesting at one point that the statement "could be taken as counsel for
present moderation." The opinion continues: "[A]t worst, it amounted to nothing
more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time." From that
observation, the majority somehow concludes that the advocacy was not
directed towards inciting imminent action. But whatever other theoretical
interpretations may be placed upon the remark, there are surely possible
constructions of the statement which would encompass more or less immediate
and continuing action against the harassed police. They should not be rejected
out of hand because of an unexplained preference for other acceptable
alternatives.
The simple explanation for the result in this case is that the majority has
interpreted the evidence differently from the courts below. In doing so, however,
I believe the Court has exceeded the proper scope of our review. Rather than

Robson

68

The First Amendment

considering the "evidence" in the light most favorable to the appellee and
resolving credibility questions against the appellant, as many of our cases have
required, the Court has instead fashioned its own version of events from a paper
record, some "uncontroverted evidence," and a large measure of conjecture.
Since this is not the traditional function of any appellate court, and is surely
not a wise or proper use of the authority of this Court, I dissent.

Notes	  
1.
The Court in Brandenburg articulated a standard to distinguish
protected advocacy from unprotected speech.
Make sure you can
articulate that standard.
2.
The Court in Brandenburg overrules Whitney v. California explicitly,
reasoning that the Ohio Syndicalism Act at issue in Brandenburg is
similar to the California Syndicalism Act under which Whitney was
prosecuted. Should other cases also have been overruled, as Justice
Douglas seems to have suggested in his dissent?
3.
Is there an argument that the speech in Brandenburg was actually
more of a “clear and present” danger than the speech in Whitney?
4.
The dissent in Hess suggests that the statements and acts of Hess
are less clear that the Court describes them. Can you revise the
statements and the acts of Hess so that they would be unprotected under
the Brandenburg standard?
5.
Importantly, and similar to Cohen, Hess was convicted under a
disorderly conduct statute but was able to raise a First Amendment
claim to the statute as applied to his speech acts.

Note:	  The	  Heckler’s	  Veto	  
The danger of provoking violence by speech is sometimes said to pose the
problem of the “heckler’s veto.” Can a rowdy crowd or “hecklers”
essentially extinguish a speaker’s First Amendment rights by posing a
danger of violence? On the other hand, can apathetic or nonviolent
listeners essentially grant a speaker First Amendment protection.
Consider this situation: A group of people known as the "Bible Believers,"
came to the Arab International festival on the streets of Dearborn,
Michigan - - - as they had done the year before - - - to "preach." Their
speech included "strongly worded" slogans on signs, t-shirts, and
banners (e.g., "Islam Is A Religion of Blood and Murder"), a "severed pig's
head on a stick" (intended to protect the Bible Believers by repelling

Robson

69

The First Amendment

observers who feared it), statements through a megaphone castigating
the following of a "pedophile prophet" and warning of "God's impending
judgment." A crowd gathered, seemingly mostly of children, who yelled
back and threw items at the “preachers.” The throwing and yelling
escalated.
A law enforcement officer from the County asked the Bible Believers to
leave, and - when pressed - saying they would be cited for disorderly
conduct: "You need to leave. If you don’t leave, we’re going to cite you for
disorderly. You’re creating a disturbance. I mean, look at your people
here. This is crazy!” They were eventually escorted out.
Members of the Bible Believers brought suit in federal court arguing that
their First Amendment rights were violated. The district judge granted
summary judgment in favor of the County and its officials. On appeal, a
divided Sixth Circuit panel affirmed, with the dissenting judge arguing
that the “law enforcement is principally required to protect lawful
speakers over and above law-breakers.” The Sixth Circuit en banc
vacated the panel opinion.
What do you think the proper result should be and why?

THOMAS, AND ALITO, JJ., JOINED. BREYER, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH GINSBURG
AND SOTOMAYOR, JJ., JOINED.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Congress has prohibited the provision of "material support or resources" to
certain foreign organizations that engage in terrorist activity. 18 U. S. C.
§2339B(a)(1). That prohibition is based on a finding that the specified
organizations "are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to
such an organization facilitates that conduct." Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), §301(a)(7), 110 Stat. 1247, note following
18 U. S. C. §2339B (Findings and Purpose). The plaintiffs in this litigation seek
to provide support to two such organizations. Plaintiffs claim that they seek to
facilitate only the lawful, nonviolent purposes of those groups, and that

Robson

The First Amendment

applying the material-support law to prevent them from doing so violates the
Constitution. In particular, they claim that the statute is too vague, in violation
of the Fifth Amendment, and that it infringes their rights to freedom of speech
and association, in violation of the First Amendment. We conclude that the
material-support statute is constitutional as applied to the particular activities
plaintiffs have told us they wish to pursue. We do not, however, address the
resolution of more difficult cases that may arise under the statute in the future.
I
This litigation concerns 18 U. S. C. §2339B, which makes it a federal crime to
"knowingly provid[e] material support or resources to a foreign terrorist
organization." Congress has amended the definition of "material support or
resources" periodically, but at present it is defined as follows:
"[T]he term 'material support or resources' means any property, tangible or
intangible, or service, including currency or monetary instruments or financial
securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance,
safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment,
facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel (1 or more
individuals who may be or include oneself), and transportation, except medicine
or religious materials."

§2339A(b)(1); see also §2339B(g)(4).
The authority to designate an entity a "foreign terrorist organization" rests with
the Secretary of State. 8 U. S. C. §§1189(a)(1), (d)(4). She may, in consultation
with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General, so designate an
organization upon finding that it is foreign, engages in "terrorist activity" or
"terrorism," and thereby "threatens the security of United States nationals or
the national security of the United States." §§1189(a)(1), (d)(4). " '[N]ational
security' means the national defense, foreign relations, or economic interests of
the United States." §1189(d)(2). An entity designated a foreign terrorist
organization may seek review of that designation before the D. C. Circuit within
30 days of that designation. §1189(c)(1).
In 1997, the Secretary of State designated 30 groups as foreign terrorist
organizations. See 62 Fed. Reg. 52650. Two of those groups are the Kurdistan
Workers' Party (also known as the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan, or PKK) and the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The PKK is an organization founded in
1974 with the aim of establishing an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey. The LTTE is an organization founded in 1976 for the
purpose of creating an independent Tamil state in Sri Lanka. The District Court
in this action found that the PKK and the LTTE engage in political and
humanitarian activities. The Government has presented evidence that both
groups have also committed numerous terrorist attacks, some of which have
harmed American citizens. The LTTE sought judicial review of its designation as
a foreign terrorist organization; the D. C. Circuit upheld that designation. The
PKK did not challenge its designation.
Plaintiffs in this litigation are two U. S. citizens and six domestic organizations:
the Humanitarian Law Project (HLP) (a human rights organization with
consultative status to the United Nations); Ralph Fertig (the HLP's president,
and a retired administrative law judge); Nagalingam Jeyalingam (a Tamil

physician, born in Sri Lanka and a naturalized U. S. citizen); and five nonprofit
groups dedicated to the interests of persons of Tamil descent. Brief for
Petitioners in No. 09-89, pp. ii, 10 (hereinafter Brief for Plaintiffs); App. 48. In
1998, plaintiffs filed suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the
material-support statute, §2339B. Plaintiffs claimed that they wished to provide
support for the humanitarian and political activities of the PKK and the LTTE in
the form of monetary contributions, other tangible aid, legal training, and
political advocacy, but that they could not do so for fear of prosecution under
§2339B.
As relevant here, plaintiffs claimed that the material-support statute was
unconstitutional on two grounds: First, it violated their freedom of speech and
freedom of association under the First Amendment, because it criminalized
their provision of material support to the PKK and the LTTE, without requiring
the Government to prove that plaintiffs had a specific intent to further the
unlawful ends of those organizations. Second, plaintiffs argued that the statute
was unconstitutionally vague.
*** [While the litigation was pending] in 2001, Congress amended the definition
of "material support or resources" to add the term "expert advice or assistance."
Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to
Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act), §805(a)(2)(B), 115
Stat. 377.*** [And] Congress again amended §2339B and the definition of
"material support or resources." Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention
Act of 2004 (IRTPA), §6603, 118 Stat. 3762-3764.
In IRTPA, Congress clarified the mental state necessary to violate §2339B,
requiring knowledge of the foreign group's designation as a terrorist
organization or the group's commission of terrorist acts. §2339B(a)(1). Congress
also added the term "service" to the definition of "material support or
resources," §2339A(b)(1), and defined "training" to mean "instruction or
teaching designed to impart a specific skill, as opposed to general knowledge,"
§2339A(b)(2). It also defined "expert advice or assistance" to mean "advice or
assistance derived from scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge."
§2339A(b)(3). Finally, IRTPA clarified the scope of the term "personnel" by
providing:
"No person may be prosecuted under [§2339B] in connection with the term
'personnel' unless that person has knowingly provided, attempted to provide, or
conspired to provide a foreign terrorist organization with 1 or more individuals
(who may be or include himself) to work under that terrorist organization's
direction or control or to organize, manage, supervise, or otherwise direct the
operation of that organization. Individuals who act entirely independently of the
foreign terrorist organization to advance its goals or objectives shall not be
considered to be working under the foreign terrorist organization's direction and
control." §2339B(h).
*** The Government petitioned for certiorari, and plaintiffs filed a conditional
cross-petition. We granted both petitions. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).

The First Amendment

II
Given the complicated 12-year history of this litigation, we pause to clarify the
questions before us. Plaintiffs challenge §2339B's prohibition on four types of
material support--"training," "expert advice or assistance," "service," and
"personnel." They raise three constitutional claims. First, plaintiffs claim that
§2339B violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because these
four statutory terms are impermissibly vague. Second, plaintiffs claim that
§2339B violates their freedom of speech under the First Amendment. Third,
plaintiffs claim that §2339B violates their First Amendment freedom of
association.
Plaintiffs do not challenge the above statutory terms in all their applications.
Rather, plaintiffs claim that §2339B is invalid to the extent it prohibits them
from engaging in certain specified activities. With respect to the HLP and Judge
Fertig, those activities are: (1) "train[ing] members of [the] PKK on how to use
humanitarian and international law to peacefully resolve disputes"; (2)
"engag[ing] in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds who live in Turkey"; and (3)
"teach[ing] PKK members how to petition various representative bodies such as
the United Nations for relief." With respect to the other plaintiffs, those
activities are: (1) "train[ing] members of [the] LTTE to present claims for
tsunami-related aid to mediators and international bodies"; (2) "offer[ing] their
legal expertise in negotiating peace agreements between the LTTE and the Sri
Lankan government"; and (3) "engag[ing] in political advocacy on behalf of
Tamils who live in Sri Lanka."
Plaintiffs also state that "the LTTE was recently defeated militarily in Sri
Lanka," so "[m]uch of the support the Tamil organizations and Dr. Jeyalingam
sought to provide is now moot." Plaintiffs thus seek only to support the LTTE
"as a political organization outside Sri Lanka advocating for the rights of
Tamils."
Counsel for plaintiffs specifically stated at oral argument that
plaintiffs no longer seek to teach the LTTE how to present claims for tsunamirelated aid, because the LTTE now "has no role in Sri Lanka." For that reason,
helping the LTTE negotiate a peace agreement with Sri Lanka appears to be
moot as well. Thus, we do not consider the application of §2339B to those
activities here.
One last point. Plaintiffs seek preenforcement review of a criminal statute.
Before addressing the merits, we must be sure that this is a justiciable case or
controversy under Article III. We conclude that it is: Plaintiffs face "a credible
threat of prosecution" and "should not be required to await and undergo a
criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief." ***
III
Plaintiffs claim, as a threshold matter, that we should affirm the Court of
Appeals without reaching any issues of constitutional law. They contend that
we should interpret the material-support statute, when applied to speech, to
require proof that a defendant intended to further a foreign terrorist
organization's illegal activities. That interpretation, they say, would end the
litigation because plaintiffs' proposed activities consist of speech, but plaintiffs
do not intend to further unlawful conduct by the PKK or the LTTE.

Robson

73

The First Amendment

We reject plaintiffs' interpretation of §2339B because it is inconsistent with the
text of the statute. Section 2339B(a)(1) prohibits "knowingly" providing material
support. It then specifically describes the type of knowledge that is required: "To
violate this paragraph, a person must have knowledge that the organization is a
designated terrorist organization . . ., that the organization has engaged or
engages in terrorist activity ..., or that the organization has engaged or engages
in terrorism... ." Congress plainly spoke to the necessary mental state for a
violation of §2339B, and it chose knowledge about the organization's connection
to terrorism, not specific intent to further the organization's terrorist
activities.***
Finally, plaintiffs give the game away when they argue that a specific intent
requirement should apply only when the material-support statute applies to
speech. There is no basis whatever in the text of §2339B to read the same
provisions in that statute as requiring intent in some circumstances but not
others. It is therefore clear that plaintiffs are asking us not to interpret §2339B,
but to revise it. ***
We cannot avoid the constitutional issues in this litigation through plaintiffs'
proposed interpretation of §2339B.
IV
We turn to the question whether the material-support statute, as applied to
plaintiffs, is impermissibly vague under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment. "A conviction fails to comport with due process if the statute
under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair
notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or
encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement." United States v. Williams
(2008). *** We have said that when a statute "interferes with the right of free
speech or of association, a more stringent vagueness test should apply." "But
'perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of
regulations that restrict expressive activity.' " Williams (quoting Ward v. Rock
Against Racism (1989).
The Court of Appeals did not adhere to these principles. Instead, the lower
court merged plaintiffs' vagueness challenge with their First Amendment claims,
holding that portions of the material-support statute were unconstitutionally
vague because they applied to protected speech--regardless of whether those
applications were clear. The court stated that, even if persons of ordinary
intelligence understood the scope of the term "training," that term would
"remai[n] impermissibly vague" because it could "be read to encompass speech
and advocacy protected by the First Amendment." It also found "service" and a
portion of "expert advice or assistance" to be vague because those terms covered
protected speech.
*** [T]he Court of Appeals contravened the rule that "[a] plaintiff who engages in
some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of
the law as applied to the conduct of others." That rule makes no exception for
conduct in the form of speech. Thus, even to the extent a heightened vagueness
standard applies, a plaintiff whose speech is clearly proscribed cannot raise a
successful vagueness claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment for lack of notice. And he certainly cannot do so based on the

Robson

74

The First Amendment

speech of others. Such a plaintiff may have a valid overbreadth claim under the
First Amendment, but our precedents make clear that a Fifth Amendment
vagueness challenge does not turn on whether a law applies to a substantial
amount of protected expression. Otherwise the doctrines would be substantially
redundant.
Under a proper analysis, plaintiffs' claims of vagueness lack merit. ***
V
A
We next consider whether the material-support statute, as applied to plaintiffs,
violates the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. Both
plaintiffs and the Government take extreme positions on this question. Plaintiffs
claim that Congress has banned their "pure political speech." It has not. Under
the material-support statute, plaintiffs may say anything they wish on any topic.
They may speak and write freely about the PKK and LTTE, the governments of
Turkey and Sri Lanka, human rights, and international law. They may advocate
before the United Nations. As the Government states: "The statute does not
prohibit independent advocacy or expression of any kind." Section 2339B also
"does not prevent [plaintiffs] from becoming members of the PKK and LTTE or
impose any sanction on them for doing so." Congress has not, therefore,
sought to suppress ideas or opinions in the form of "pure political speech."
Rather, Congress has prohibited "material support," which most often does not
take the form of speech at all. And when it does, the statute is carefully drawn
to cover only a narrow category of speech to, under the direction of, or in
coordination with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist
organizations.4
For its part, the Government takes the foregoing too far, claiming that the only
thing truly at issue in this litigation is conduct, not speech. Section 2339B is
directed at the fact of plaintiffs' interaction with the PKK and LTTE, the
Government contends, and only incidentally burdens their expression. The
Government argues that the proper standard of review is therefore the one set
out in United States v. O'Brien (1968). In that case, the Court rejected a First
Amendment challenge to a conviction under a generally applicable prohibition
on destroying draft cards, even though O'Brien had burned his card in protest
against the draft. In so doing, we applied what we have since called
"intermediate scrutiny," under which a "content-neutral regulation will be
sustained under the First Amendment if it advances important governmental
interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not burden
substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests." Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC (1997)(citing O'Brien).
The Government is wrong that the only thing actually at issue in this litigation
is conduct, and therefore wrong to argue that O'Brien provides the correct
standard of review. O'Brien does not provide the applicable standard for
reviewing a content-based regulation of speech, see R. A. V. v. St. Paul (1992);
Texas v. Johnson (1989), and §2339B regulates speech on the basis of its
content. Plaintiffs want to speak to the PKK and the LTTE, and whether they
may do so under §2339B depends on what they say. If plaintiffs' speech to
those groups imparts a "specific skill" or communicates advice derived from

Robson

75

The First Amendment

"specialized knowledge"--for example, training on the use of international law or
advice on petitioning the United Nations--then it is barred. On the other hand,
plaintiffs' speech is not barred if it imparts only general or unspecialized
knowledge.
The Government argues that §2339B should nonetheless receive intermediate
scrutiny because it generally functions as a regulation of conduct. That
argument runs headlong into a number of our precedents, most prominently
Cohen v. California (1971). Cohen also involved a generally applicable regulation
of conduct, barring breaches of the peace. But when Cohen was convicted for
wearing a jacket bearing an epithet, we did not apply O'Brien. Instead, we
recognized that the generally applicable law was directed at Cohen because of
what his speech communicated--he violated the breach of the peace statute
because of the offensive content of his particular message. We accordingly
applied more rigorous scrutiny and reversed his conviction.
This suit falls into the same category. The law here may be described as
directed at conduct, as the law in Cohen was directed at breaches of the peace,
but as applied to plaintiffs the conduct triggering coverage under the statute
consists of communicating a message. As we explained in Texas v. Johnson: "If
the [Government's] regulation is not related to expression, then the less
stringent standard we announced in United States v. O'Brien for regulations of
noncommunicative conduct controls. If it is, then we are outside of O'Brien's
test, and we must [apply] a more demanding standard."
B
The First Amendment issue before us is more refined than either plaintiffs or
the Government would have it. It is not whether the Government may prohibit
pure political speech, or may prohibit material support in the form of conduct.
It is instead whether the Government may prohibit what plaintiffs want to do-provide material support to the PKK and LTTE in the form of speech.
Everyone agrees that the Government's interest in combating terrorism is an
urgent objective of the highest order. Plaintiffs' complaint is that the ban on
material support, applied to what they wish to do, is not "necessary to further
that interest." The objective of combating terrorism does not justify prohibiting
their speech, plaintiffs argue, because their support will advance only the
legitimate activities of the designated terrorist organizations, not their terrorism.
Whether foreign terrorist organizations meaningfully segregate support of their
legitimate activities from support of terrorism is an empirical question. When it
enacted §2339B in 1996, Congress made specific findings regarding the serious
threat posed by international terrorism. One of those findings explicitly rejects
plaintiffs' contention that their support would not further the terrorist activities
of the PKK and LTTE: "[F]oreign organizations that engage in terrorist activity
are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an
organization facilitates that conduct." §301(a)(7) (emphasis added).
Plaintiffs argue that the reference to "any contribution" in this finding meant
only monetary support. There is no reason to read the finding to be so limited,
particularly because Congress expressly prohibited so much more than
monetary support in §2339B. Congress's use of the term "contribution" is best

Robson

76

The First Amendment

read to reflect a determination that any form of material support furnished "to"
a foreign terrorist organization should be barred, which is precisely what the
material-support statute does. Indeed, when Congress enacted §2339B,
Congress simultaneously removed an exception that had existed in §2339A(a)
(1994 ed.) for the provision of material support in the form of "humanitarian
assistance to persons not directly involved in" terrorist activity. AEDPA §323,
110 Stat. 1255; 205 F. 3d, at 1136. That repeal demonstrates that Congress
considered and rejected the view that ostensibly peaceful aid would have no
harmful effects.
We are convinced that Congress was justified in rejecting that view. The PKK
and the LTTE are deadly groups. "The PKK's insurgency has claimed more than
22,000 lives." The LTTE has engaged in extensive suicide bombings and
political assassinations, including killings of the Sri Lankan President, Security
Minister, and Deputy Defense Minister. "On January 31, 1996, the LTTE
exploded a truck bomb filled with an estimated 1,000 pounds of explosives at
the Central Bank in Colombo, killing 100 people and injuring more than 1,400.
This bombing was the most deadly terrorist incident in the world in 1996." It is
not difficult to conclude as Congress did that the "tain[t]" of such violent
activities is so great that working in coordination with or at the command of the
PKK and LTTE serves to legitimize and further their terrorist means.
Material support meant to "promot[e] peaceable, lawful conduct," can further
terrorism by foreign groups in multiple ways. "Material support" is a valuable
resource by definition. Such support frees up other resources within the
organization that may be put to violent ends. It also importantly helps lend
legitimacy to foreign terrorist groups--legitimacy that makes it easier for those
groups to persist, to recruit members, and to raise funds--all of which facilitate
more terrorist attacks. "Terrorist organizations do not maintain organizational
'firewalls' that would prevent or deter . . . sharing and commingling of support
and benefits." "[I]nvestigators have revealed how terrorist groups systematically
conceal their activities behind charitable, social, and political fronts." M. LEVITT,
HAMAS: POLITICS, CHARITY, AND TERRORISM IN THE SERVICE OF JIHAD 2-3 (2006).
"Indeed, some designated foreign terrorist organizations use social and political
components to recruit personnel to carry out terrorist operations, and to
provide support to criminal terrorists and their families in aid of such
operations."
Money is fungible, and "[w]hen foreign terrorist organizations that have a dual
structure raise funds, they highlight the civilian and humanitarian ends to
which such moneys could be put." But "there is reason to believe that foreign
terrorist organizations do not maintain legitimate financial firewalls between
those funds raised for civil, nonviolent activities, and those ultimately used to
support violent, terrorist operations." Thus, "[f]unds raised ostensibly for
charitable purposes have in the past been redirected by some terrorist groups
to fund the purchase of arms and explosives." There is evidence that the PKK
and the LTTE, in particular, have not "respected the line between humanitarian
and violent activities."
The dissent argues that there is "no natural stopping place" for the proposition
that aiding a foreign terrorist organization's lawful activity promotes the
terrorist organization as a whole. But Congress has settled on just such a

Robson

77

The First Amendment

natural stopping place: The statute reaches only material support coordinated
with or under the direction of a designated foreign terrorist organization.
Independent advocacy that might be viewed as promoting the group's legitimacy
is not covered.
Providing foreign terrorist groups with material support in any form also
furthers terrorism by straining the United States' relationships with its allies
and undermining cooperative efforts between nations to prevent terrorist
attacks. We see no reason to question Congress's finding that "international
cooperation is required for an effective response to terrorism, as demonstrated
by the numerous multilateral conventions in force providing universal
prosecutive jurisdiction over persons involved in a variety of terrorist acts,
including hostage taking, murder of an internationally protected person, and
aircraft piracy and sabotage." The material-support statute furthers this
international effort by prohibiting aid for foreign terrorist groups that harm the
United States' partners abroad: "A number of designated foreign terrorist
organizations have attacked moderate governments with which the United
States has vigorously endeavored to maintain close and friendly relations," and
those attacks "threaten [the] social, economic and political stability" of such
governments. "[O]ther foreign terrorist organizations attack our NATO allies,
thereby
implicating
important
and
sensitive
multilateral
security
arrangements."
For example, the Republic of Turkey--a fellow member of NATO--is defending
itself against a violent insurgency waged by the PKK. That nation and our other
allies would react sharply to Americans furnishing material support to foreign
groups like the PKK, and would hardly be mollified by the explanation that the
support was meant only to further those groups' "legitimate" activities. From
Turkey's perspective, there likely are no such activities.
C
In analyzing whether it is possible in practice to distinguish material support
for a foreign terrorist group's violent activities and its nonviolent activities, we
do not rely exclusively on our own inferences drawn from the record evidence.
We have before us an affidavit stating the Executive Branch's conclusion on
that question. The State Department informs us that "[t]he experience and
analysis of the U. S. government agencies charged with combating terrorism
strongly suppor[t]" Congress's finding that all contributions to foreign terrorist
organizations further their terrorism. McKune Affidavit, App. 133, ¶8. In the
Executive's view: "Given the purposes, organizational structure, and clandestine
nature of foreign terrorist organizations, it is highly likely that any material
support to these organizations will ultimately inure to the benefit of their
criminal, terrorist functions--regardless of whether such support was ostensibly
intended to support non-violent, non-terrorist activities."
That evaluation of the facts by the Executive, like Congress's assessment, is
entitled to deference. This litigation implicates sensitive and weighty interests of
national security and foreign affairs. The PKK and the LTTE have committed
terrorist acts against American citizens abroad, and the material-support
statute addresses acute foreign policy concerns involving relationships with our
Nation's allies. ***

Robson

78

The First Amendment

Our precedents, old and new, make clear that concerns of national security and
foreign relations do not warrant abdication of the judicial role. We do not defer
to the Government's reading of the First Amendment, even when such interests
are at stake. We are one with the dissent that the Government's "authority and
expertise in these matters do not automatically trump the Court's own
obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to individuals."
But when it comes to collecting evidence and drawing factual inferences in this
area, "the lack of competence on the part of the courts is marked," and respect
for the Government's conclusions is appropriate.
*** This context is different from that in decisions like Cohen. In that case, the
application of the statute turned on the offensiveness of the speech at issue.
Observing that "one man's vulgarity is another's lyric," we invalidated Cohen's
conviction in part because we concluded that "governmental officials cannot
make principled distinctions in this area." In this litigation, by contrast,
Congress and the Executive are uniquely positioned to make principled
distinctions between activities that will further terrorist conduct and undermine
United States foreign policy, and those that will not.
We also find it significant that Congress has been conscious of its own
responsibility to consider how its actions may implicate constitutional concerns.
First, §2339B only applies to designated foreign terrorist organizations. There is,
and always has been, a limited number of those organizations designated by the
Executive Branch, and any groups so designated may seek judicial review of the
designation. Second, in response to the lower courts' holdings in this litigation,
Congress added clarity to the statute by providing narrowing definitions of the
terms "training," "personnel," and "expert advice or assistance," as well as an
explanation of the knowledge required to violate §2339B. Third, in effectuating
its stated intent not to abridge First Amendment rights, Congress has also
displayed a careful balancing of interests in creating limited exceptions to the
ban on material support. The definition of material support, for example,
excludes medicine and religious materials. In this area perhaps more than any
other, the Legislature's superior capacity for weighing competing interests
means that "we must be particularly careful not to substitute our judgment of
what is desirable for that of Congress."
Finally, and most importantly,
Congress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed any
activities not directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by foreign terrorist
groups.
At bottom, plaintiffs simply disagree with the considered judgment of Congress
and the Executive that providing material support to a designated foreign
terrorist organization--even seemingly benign support--bolsters the terrorist
activities of that organization. That judgment, however, is entitled to significant
weight, and we have persuasive evidence before us to sustain it. Given the
sensitive interests in national security and foreign affairs at stake, the political
branches have adequately substantiated their determination that, to serve the
Government's interest in preventing terrorism, it was necessary to prohibit
providing material support in the form of training, expert advice, personnel, and
services to foreign terrorist groups, even if the supporters meant to promote
only the groups' nonviolent ends.

Robson

79

The First Amendment

We turn to the particular speech plaintiffs propose to undertake. First, plaintiffs
propose to "train members of [the] PKK on how to use humanitarian and
international law to peacefully resolve disputes." Congress can, consistent with
the First Amendment, prohibit this direct training. *** A foreign terrorist
organization introduced to the structures of the international legal system
might use the information to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt. This possibility
is real, not remote.
Second, plaintiffs propose to "teach PKK members how to petition various
representative bodies such as the United Nations for relief." The Government
acts within First Amendment strictures in banning this proposed speech
because it teaches the organization how to acquire "relief," which plaintiffs
never define with any specificity, and which could readily include monetary aid.
*** Money is fungible and Congress logically concluded that money a terrorist
group such as the PKK obtains using the techniques plaintiffs propose to teach
could be redirected to funding the group's violent activities.
Finally, plaintiffs propose to "engage in political advocacy on behalf of Kurds
who live in Turkey," and "engage in political advocacy on behalf of Tamils who
live in Sri Lanka." *** Plaintiffs' proposals are phrased at such a high level of
generality that they cannot prevail in this preenforcement challenge.
In responding to the foregoing, the dissent fails to address the real dangers at
stake. It instead considers only the possible benefits of plaintiffs' proposed
activities in the abstract. The dissent seems unwilling to entertain the prospect
that training and advising a designated foreign terrorist organization on how to
take advantage of international entities might benefit that organization in a way
that facilitates its terrorist activities. In the dissent's world, such training is all
to the good. Congress and the Executive, however, have concluded that we live
in a different world: one in which the designated foreign terrorist organizations
"are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an
organization facilitates that conduct." AEDPA §301(a)(7). One in which, for
example, "the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was forced to
close a Kurdish refugee camp in northern Iraq because the camp had come
under the control of the PKK, and the PKK had failed to respect its 'neutral and
humanitarian nature.' " Training and advice on how to work with the United
Nations could readily have helped the PKK in its efforts to use the United
Nations camp as a base for terrorist activities.
If only good can come from training our adversaries in international dispute
resolution, presumably it would have been unconstitutional to prevent
American citizens from training the Japanese Government on using
international organizations and mechanisms to resolve disputes during World
War II. It would, under the dissent's reasoning, have been contrary to our
commitment to resolving disputes through " 'deliberative forces,' " (quoting
Whitney v. California (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring)), for Congress to
conclude that assisting Japan on that front might facilitate its war effort more
generally. That view is not one the First Amendment requires us to embrace.
All this is not to say that any future applications of the material-support statute
to speech or advocacy will survive First Amendment scrutiny. It is also not to
say that any other statute relating to speech and terrorism would satisfy the

Robson

80

The First Amendment

First Amendment. In particular, we in no way suggest that a regulation of
independent speech would pass constitutional muster, even if the Government
were to show that such speech benefits foreign terrorist organizations. We also
do not suggest that Congress could extend the same prohibition on material
support at issue here to domestic organizations. We simply hold that, in
prohibiting the particular forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to
foreign terrorist groups, §2339B does not violate the freedom of speech.
VI
Plaintiffs' final claim is that the material-support statute violates their freedom
of association under the First Amendment. Plaintiffs argue that the statute
criminalizes the mere fact of their associating with the PKK and the LTTE.***
The Court of Appeals correctly rejected this claim because the statute does not
penalize mere association with a foreign terrorist organization. ***
Plaintiffs also argue that the material-support statute burdens their freedom of
association because it prevents them from providing support to designated
foreign terrorist organizations, but not to other groups. Any burden on
plaintiffs' freedom of association in this regard is justified for the same reasons
that we have denied plaintiffs' free speech challenge. It would be strange if the
Constitution permitted Congress to prohibit certain forms of speech that
constitute material support, but did not permit Congress to prohibit that
support only to particularly dangerous and lawless foreign organizations.
Congress is not required to ban material support to every group or none at all.
The Preamble to the Constitution proclaims that the people of the United States
ordained and established that charter of government in part to "provide for the
common defence." As Madison explained, "[s]ecurity against foreign danger
is . . . an avowed and essential object of the American Union." THE FEDERALIST
NO. 41, p. 269 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). We hold that, in regulating the particular
forms of support that plaintiffs seek to provide to foreign terrorist organizations,
Congress has pursued that objective consistent with the limitations of the First
and Fifth Amendments.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is
affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BREYER, WITH WHOM JUSTICES GINSBURG AND SOTOMAYOR JOIN, DISSENTING.
Like the Court, and substantially for the reasons it gives, I do not think this
statute is unconstitutionally vague. But I cannot agree with the Court's
conclusion that the Constitution permits the Government to prosecute the
plaintiffs criminally for engaging in coordinated teaching and advocacy
furthering the designated organizations' lawful political objectives. In my view,
the Government has not met its burden of showing that an interpretation of the
statute that would prohibit this speech- and association-related activity serves
the Government's compelling interest in combating terrorism. And I would
interpret the statute as normally placing activity of this kind outside its scope.

Robson

81

The First Amendment

I
*** In my view, the Government has not made the strong showing necessary to
justify under the First Amendment the criminal prosecution of those who
engage in these [described] activities. All the activities involve the
communication and advocacy of political ideas and lawful means of achieving
political ends. Even the subjects the plaintiffs wish to teach--using
international law to resolve disputes peacefully or petitioning the United
Nations, for instance--concern political speech. We cannot avoid the
constitutional significance of these facts on the basis that some of this speech
takes place outside the United States and is directed at foreign governments, for
the activities also involve advocacy in this country directed to our government
and its policies. The plaintiffs, for example, wish to write and distribute
publications and to speak before the United States Congress.
That this speech and association for political purposes is the kind of activity to
which the First Amendment ordinarily offers its strongest protection is
elementary.
Although in the Court's view the statute applies only where the PKK helps to
coordinate a defendant's activities, the simple fact of "coordination" alone
cannot readily remove protection that the First Amendment would otherwise
grant. That amendment, after all, also protects the freedom of association.
"Coordination" with a political group, like membership, involves association.
"Coordination" with a group that engages in unlawful activity also does not
deprive the plaintiffs of the First Amendment's protection under any traditional
"categorical" exception to its protection. The plaintiffs do not propose to solicit a
crime. They will not engage in fraud or defamation or circulate obscenity. Cf.
United States v. Stevens (2010) (describing "categories" of unprotected speech).
And the First Amendment protects advocacy even of unlawful action so long as
that advocacy is not "directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action
and . . . likely to incite or produce such action." Brandenburg v. Ohio, (1969) (per
curiam) (emphasis added). Here the plaintiffs seek to advocate peaceful, lawful
action to secure political ends; and they seek to teach others how to do the same.
No one contends that the plaintiffs' speech to these organizations can be
prohibited as incitement under Brandenburg.
Moreover, the Court has previously held that a person who associates with a
group that uses unlawful means to achieve its ends does not thereby
necessarily forfeit the First Amendment's protection for freedom of association.
***
Not even the "serious and deadly problem" of international terrorism can
require automatic forfeiture of First Amendment rights. §301(a)(1), 110 Stat.
1247, note following 18 U. S. C. §2339B. Cf. §2339B(i) (instructing courts not to
"constru[e] or appl[y the statute] so as to abridge the exercise of right
guaranteed under the First Amendment"). After all, this Court has recognized
that not " '[e]ven the war power ... remove[s] constitutional limitations
safeguarding essential liberties.' " See also Abrams v. United States (1919)
(Holmes, J., dissenting) ("[A]s against dangers peculiar to war, as against others,
the principle of the right to free speech is always the same"). Thus, there is no
general First Amendment exception that applies here. If the statute is

Robson

82

The First Amendment

constitutional in this context, it would have to come with a strong justification
attached.
It is not surprising that the majority, in determining the constitutionality of
criminally prohibiting the plaintiffs' proposed activities, would apply, not the
kind of intermediate First Amendment standard that applies to conduct, but " 'a
more demanding standard.' " Indeed, where, as here, a statute applies criminal
penalties and at least arguably does so on the basis of content-based
distinctions, I should think we would scrutinize the statute and justifications
"strictly"--to determine whether the prohibition is justified by a "compelling"
need that cannot be "less restrictively" accommodated.
But, even if we assume for argument's sake that "strict scrutiny" does not apply,
no one can deny that we must at the very least "measure the validity of the
means adopted by Congress against both the goal it has sought to achieve and
the specific prohibitions of the First Amendment." And here I need go no
further, for I doubt that the statute, as the Government would interpret it, can
survive any reasonably applicable First Amendment standard.
The Government does identify a compelling countervailing interest, namely, the
interest in protecting the security of the United States and its nationals from
the threats that foreign terrorist organizations pose by denying those
organizations financial and other fungible resources. I do not dispute the
importance of this interest. But I do dispute whether the interest can justify the
statute's criminal prohibition. To put the matter more specifically, precisely how
does application of the statute to the protected activities before us help achieve
that important security-related end?
The Government makes two efforts to answer this question. First, the
Government says that the plaintiffs' support for these organizations is "fungible"
in the same sense as other forms of banned support. Being fungible, the
plaintiffs' support could, for example, free up other resources, which the
organization might put to terrorist ends.
The proposition that the two very different kinds of "support" are "fungible,"
however, is not obviously true. There is no obvious way in which undertaking
advocacy for political change through peaceful means or teaching the PKK and
LTTE, say, how to petition the United Nations for political change is fungible
with other resources that might be put to more sinister ends in the way that
donations of money, food, or computer training are fungible. It is far from
obvious that these advocacy activities can themselves be redirected, or will free
other resources that can be directed, towards terrorist ends. Thus, we must
determine whether the Government has come forward with evidence to support
its claim.
The Government has provided us with no empirical information that might
convincingly support this claim. Instead, the Government cites only to evidence
that Congress was concerned about the "fungible" nature in general of
resources, predominately money and material goods. It points to a
congressional finding that "foreign organizations that engage in terrorist activity
are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an
organization facilitates that conduct." §301(a)(7), 110 Stat. 1247, note following
18 U. S. C. §2339B (emphasis added). It also points to a House Report's

Robson

83

The First Amendment

statement that "supply[ing] funds, goods, or services" would "hel[p] defray the
cost to the terrorist organization of running the ostensibly legitimate activities,"
and "in turn fre[e] an equal sum that can then be spent on terrorist activities."
H. R. Rep. No. 104-383, p. 81 (1995) (emphasis added). Finally, the Government
refers to a State Department official's affidavit describing how ostensibly
charitable contributions have either been "redirected" to terrorist ends or, even
if spent charitably, have "unencumber[ed] funds raised from other sources for
use in facilitating violent, terrorist activities and gaining political support for
these activities." Declaration of Kenneth R. McKune, App. 134, 136 (emphasis
added).
The most one can say in the Government's favor about these statements is that
they might be read as offering highly general support for its argument. The
statements do not, however, explain in any detail how the plaintiffs' politicaladvocacy-related activities might actually be "fungible" and therefore capable of
being diverted to terrorist use. Nor do they indicate that Congress itself was
concerned with "support" of this kind. The affidavit refers to "funds,"
"financing," and "goods"--none of which encompasses the plaintiffs' activities.
The statutory statement and the House Report use broad terms like
"contributions" and "services" that might be construed as encompassing the
plaintiffs' activities. But in context, those terms are more naturally understood
as referring to contributions of goods, money, or training and other services (say,
computer programming) that could be diverted to, or free funding for, terrorist
ends. Peaceful political advocacy does not obviously fall into these categories.
And the statute itself suggests that Congress did not intend to curtail freedom
of speech or association. See §2339B(i) ("Nothing in this section shall be
construed or applied so as to abridge the exercise of rights guaranteed under
the First Amendment").
Second, the Government says that the plaintiffs' proposed activities will
"bolste[r] a terrorist organization's efficacy and strength in a community" and
"undermin[e] this nation's efforts to delegitimize and weaken those groups." In
the Court's view, too, the Constitution permits application of the statute to
activities of the kind at issue in part because those activities could provide a
group that engages in terrorism with "legitimacy." The Court suggests that,
armed with this greater "legitimacy," these organizations will more readily be
able to obtain material support of the kinds Congress plainly intended to ban-money, arms, lodging, and the like.
Yet the Government does not claim that the statute forbids any speech
"legitimating" a terrorist group. Rather, it reads the statute as permitting (1)
membership in terrorist organizations, (2) "peaceably assembling with members
of the PKK and LTTE for lawful discussion," or (3) "independent advocacy" on
behalf of these organizations. The Court, too, emphasizes that activities not
"coordinated with" the terrorist groups are not banned. And it argues that
speaking, writing, and teaching aimed at furthering a terrorist organization's
peaceful political ends could "mak[e] it easier for those groups to persist, to
recruit members, and to raise funds."
But this "legitimacy" justification cannot by itself warrant suppression of
political speech, advocacy, and association. Speech, association, and related
activities on behalf of a group will often, perhaps always, help to legitimate that

Robson

84

The First Amendment

group. Thus, were the law to accept a "legitimating" effect, in and of itself and
without qualification, as providing sufficient grounds for imposing such a ban,
the First Amendment battle would be lost in untold instances where it should
be won. Once one accepts this argument, there is no natural stopping place.
The argument applies as strongly to "independent" as to "coordinated" advocacy.
That fact is reflected in part in the Government's claim that the ban here, so
supported, prohibits a lawyer hired by a designated group from filing on behalf
of that group an amicus brief before the United Nations or even before this
Court.
That fact is also reflected in the difficulty of drawing a line designed to accept
the legitimacy argument in some instances but not in others. It is inordinately
difficult to distinguish when speech activity will and when it will not initiate the
chain of causation the Court suggests--a chain that leads from peaceful
advocacy to "legitimacy" to increased support for the group to an increased
supply of material goods that support its terrorist activities. Even were we to
find some such line of distinction, its application would seem so inherently
uncertain that it would often, perhaps always, "chill" protected speech beyond
its boundary. In short, the justification, put forward simply in abstract terms
and without limitation, must always, or it will never, be sufficient. Given the
nature of the plaintiffs' activities, "always" cannot possibly be the First
Amendment's answer.
*** In my own view, the majority's arguments stretch the concept of "fungibility"
beyond constitutional limits. Neither Congress nor the Government advanced
these particular hypothetical claims. I am not aware of any case in this Court-not Gitlow v. New York (1925), not Schenck v. United States (1919), not Abrams
(1919) not the later Communist Party cases decided during the heat of the Cold
War--in which the Court accepted anything like a claim that speech or teaching
might be criminalized lest it, e.g., buy negotiating time for an opponent who
would put that time to bad use.
Moreover, the risk that those who are taught will put otherwise innocent speech
or knowledge to bad use is omnipresent, at least where that risk rests on little
more than (even informed) speculation. Hence to accept this kind of argument
without more and to apply it to the teaching of a subject such as international
human rights law is to adopt a rule of law that, contrary to the Constitution's
text and First Amendment precedent, would automatically forbid the teaching of
any subject in a case where national security interests conflict with the First
Amendment. The Constitution does not allow all such conflicts to be decided in
the Government's favor. ***
II
For the reasons I have set forth, I believe application of the statute as the
Government interprets it would gravely and without adequate justification
injure interests of the kind the First Amendment protects. ***
I believe that a construction that would avoid the constitutional problem is
"fairly possible." In particular, I would read the statute as criminalizing FirstAmendment-protected pure speech and association only when the defendant
knows or intends that those activities will assist the organization's unlawful
terrorist actions. Under this reading, the Government would have to show, at a

Robson

85

The First Amendment

minimum, that such defendants provided support that they knew was
significantly likely to help the organization pursue its unlawful terrorist aims.
*** This reading of the statute protects those who engage in pure speech and
association ordinarily protected by the First Amendment. But it does not protect
that activity where a defendant purposefully intends it to help terrorism or
where a defendant knows (or willfully blinds himself to the fact) that the activity
is significantly likely to assist terrorism. Where the activity fits into these
categories of purposefully or knowingly supporting terrorist ends, the act of
providing material support to a known terrorist organization bears a close
enough relation to terrorist acts that, in my view, it likely can be prohibited
notwithstanding any First Amendment interest. Cf. Brandenburg. At the same
time, this reading does not require the Government to undertake the difficult
task of proving which, as between peaceful and nonpeaceful purposes, a
defendant specifically preferred; knowledge is enough.
*** [T]he defendant would have to know or intend (1) that he is providing
support or resources, (2) that he is providing that support to a foreign terrorist
organization, and (3) that he is providing support that is material, meaning (4)
that his support bears a significant likelihood of furthering the organization's
terrorist ends.
This fourth requirement flows directly from the statute's use of the word
"material." That word can mean being of a physical or worldly nature, but it
also can mean "being of real importance or great consequence." Webster's Third
New International Dictionary 1392 (1961). Here, it must mean the latter, for
otherwise the statute, applying only to physical aid, would not apply to speech
at all. See also §2339A(b)(1) (defining " 'material support or resources' " as "any
property, tangible or intangible" (emphasis added)). And if the statute applies
only to support that would likely be of real importance or great consequence, it
must have importance or consequence in respect to the organization's terrorist
activities. That is because support that is not significantly likely to help terrorist
activities, for purposes of this statute, neither has "importance" nor is of "great
consequence."
*** Thus, textually speaking, a statutory requirement that the defendant knew
the support was material can be read to require the Government to show that
the defendant knew that the consequences of his acts had a significant
likelihood of furthering the organization's terrorist, not just its lawful, aims. ***
The statute's history strongly supports this reading. That history makes clear
that Congress primarily sought to end assistance that takes the form of fungible
donations of money or goods. ***
In any event, the principle of constitutional avoidance demands this
interpretation. As Part II makes clear, there is a "serious" doubt--indeed, a
"grave" doubt--about the constitutionality of the statute insofar as it is read to
criminalize the activities before us. We therefore must "read the statute to
eliminate" that constitutional "doub[t] so long as such a reading is not plainly
contrary to the intent of Congress.
For this reason, the majority's statutory claim that Congress did not use the
word "knowingly" as I would use it is beside the point. Our consequent reading
is consistent with the statute's text; it is consistent with Congress' basic intent;

Robson

The First Amendment

it interprets but does not significantly add to what the statute otherwise
contains. We should adopt it.
III
Having interpreted the statute to impose the mens rea requirement just
described, I would remand the cases so that the lower courts could consider
more specifically the precise activities in which the plaintiffs still wish to engage
and determine whether and to what extent a grant of declaratory and injunctive
relief were warranted. I do not see why the majority does not also remand the
cases for consideration of the plaintiffs' activities relating to "advocating" for the
organizations' peaceful causes. *** Moreover, the majority properly rejects the
Government's argument that the plaintiffs' speech-related activities amount to
"conduct" and should be reviewed as such. Hence, I should think the majority
would wish the lower courts to reconsider this aspect of the cases, applying a
proper standard of review.
IV
In sum, these cases require us to consider how to apply the First Amendment
where national security interests are at stake. When deciding such cases,
courts are aware and must respect the fact that the Constitution entrusts to the
Executive and Legislative Branches the power to provide for the national
defense, and that it grants particular authority to the President in matters of
foreign affairs. Nonetheless, this Court has also made clear that authority and
expertise in these matters do not automatically trump the Court's own
obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to individuals.
In these cases, for the reasons I have stated, I believe the Court has failed to
examine the Government's justifications with sufficient care. It has failed to
insist upon specific evidence, rather than general assertion. It has failed to
require tailoring of means to fit compelling ends. And ultimately it deprives the
individuals before us of the protection that the First Amendment demands.
That is why, with respect, I dissent.

This chapter considers sometimes complex definitions of speech.
Speech must be distinguished from “mere” conduct, although the First
Amendment certainly protects expressive conduct and symbolic speech,
which are subject to definitional disputes.
The content of speech may place it in various categories of speech, some
more protected and some less protected as evinced by levels of scrutiny.
The content of speech may also exclude it from protection under the First
Amendment, as was apparent in the last chapter and which is also
explored in this and later chapters. Consider whether this “categorical
approach” to protectable speech is workable.

WARREN, C.J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT; MARSHALL, J., TOOK NO PART IN THE
CONSIDERATION OF THE CASE; HARLAN, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION. DOUGLAS, J., FILED A
DISSENTING OPINION.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
On the morning of March 31, 1966, David Paul O'Brien and three companions
burned their Selective Service registration certificates on the steps of the South
Boston Courthouse. A sizable crowd, including several agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, witnessed the event. Immediately after the burning,
members of the crowd began attacking O'Brien and his companions. An FBI
agent ushered O'Brien to safety inside the courthouse. After he was advised of
his right to counsel and to silence, O'Brien stated to FBI agents that he had
burned his registration certificate because of his beliefs, knowing that he was
violating federal law. He produced the charred remains of the certificate, which,
with his consent, were photographed.
For this act, O'Brien was indicted, tried, convicted, and sentenced in the United
States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. He did not contest the
fact that he had burned the certificate. He stated in argument to the jury that
he burned the certificate publicly to influence others to adopt his antiwar
beliefs, as he put it, "so that other people would reevaluate their positions with
Selective Service, with the armed forces, and reevaluate their place in the
culture of today, to hopefully consider my position."
The indictment upon which he was tried charged that he "willfully and
knowingly did mutilate, destroy, and change by burning . . . [his] Registration
Certificate (Selective Service System Form No. 2); in violation of Title 50, App.,
United States Code, Section 462 (b)." *** [It had been] amended by Congress in
1965, 79 Stat. 586 (adding the words italicized below), so that at the time
O'Brien burned his certificate an offense was committed by any person,
"who forges, alters, knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates, or in any
manner changes any such certificate. . . ." (Italics supplied.)
In the District Court, O'Brien argued that the 1965 Amendment prohibiting the
knowing destruction or mutilation of certificates was unconstitutional because
it was enacted to abridge free speech, and because it served no legitimate
legislative purpose. The District Court rejected these arguments, holding that
the statute on its face did not abridge First Amendment rights, that the court

Robson

89

The First Amendment

was not competent to inquire into the motives of Congress in enacting the 1965
Amendment, and that the Amendment was a reasonable exercise of the power
of Congress to raise armies.
On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held the 1965 Amendment
unconstitutional as a law abridging freedom of speech. *** [This] decision
conflicted with decisions by the Courts of Appeals for the Second and Eighth
Circuits upholding the 1965 Amendment against identical constitutional
challenges. *** We hold that the 1965 Amendment is constitutional both as
enacted and as applied. ***
I.
When a male reaches the age of 18, he is required by the Universal Military
Training and Service Act to register with a local draft board. He is assigned a
Selective Service number, and within five days he is issued a registration
certificate (SSS Form No. 2). Subsequently, and based on a questionnaire
completed by the registrant, he is assigned a classification denoting his
eligibility for induction, and "[a]s soon as practicable" thereafter he is issued a
Notice of Classification (SSS Form No. 110). This initial classification is not
necessarily permanent, and if in the interim before induction the registrant's
status changes in some relevant way, he may be reclassified. After such a
reclassification, the local board "as soon as practicable" issues to the registrant
a new Notice of Classification.
Both the registration and classification certificates are small white cards,
approximately 2 by 3 inches. The registration certificate specifies the name of
the registrant, the date of registration, and the number and address of the local
board with which he is registered. Also inscribed upon it are the date and place
of the registrant's birth, his residence at registration, his physical description,
his signature, and his Selective Service number. The Selective Service number
itself indicates his State of registration, his local board, his year of birth, and
his chronological position in the local board's classification record.
The classification certificate shows the registrant's name, Selective Service
number, signature, and eligibility classification. It specifies whether he was so
classified by his local board, an appeal board, or the President. It contains the
address of his local board and the date the certificate was mailed.
Both the registration and classification certificates bear notices that the
registrant must notify his local board in writing of every change in address,
physical condition, and occupational, marital, family, dependency, and military
status, and of any other fact which might change his classification. Both also
contain a notice that the registrant's Selective Service number should appear on
all communications to his local board.
Congress demonstrated its concern that certificates issued by the Selective
Service System might be abused well before the 1965 Amendment here
challenged. ***
By the 1965 Amendment, Congress added to § 12 (b) (3) of the 1948 Act the
provision here at issue, subjecting to criminal liability not only one who "forges,
alters, or in any manner changes" but also one who "knowingly destroys, [or]
knowingly mutilates" a certificate. We note at the outset that the 1965

Robson

90

The First Amendment

Amendment plainly does not abridge free speech on its face, and we do not
understand O'Brien to argue otherwise. Amended § 12 (b) (3) on its face deals
with conduct having no connection with speech. It prohibits the knowing
destruction of certificates issued by the Selective Service System, and there is
nothing necessarily expressive about such conduct. The Amendment does not
distinguish between public and private destruction, and it does not punish only
destruction engaged in for the purpose of expressing views. A law prohibiting
destruction of Selective Service certificates no more abridges free speech on its
face than a motor vehicle law prohibiting the destruction of drivers' licenses, or
a tax law prohibiting the destruction of books and records.
O'Brien nonetheless argues that the 1965 Amendment is unconstitutional in its
application to him, and is unconstitutional as enacted because what he calls
the "purpose" of Congress was "to suppress freedom of speech." We consider
these arguments separately.
II.
O'Brien first argues that the 1965 Amendment is unconstitutional as applied to
him because his act of burning his registration certificate was protected
"symbolic speech" within the First Amendment. His argument is that the
freedom of expression which the First Amendment guarantees includes all
modes of "communication of ideas by conduct," and that his conduct is within
this definition because he did it in "demonstration against the war and against
the draft."
We cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can
be labeled "speech" whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends
thereby to express an idea. However, even on the assumption that the alleged
communicative element in O'Brien's conduct is sufficient to bring into play the
First Amendment, it does not necessarily follow that the destruction of a
registration certificate is constitutionally protected activity. This Court has held
that when "speech" and "nonspeech" elements are combined in the same course
of conduct, a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the
nonspeech element can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment
freedoms. To characterize the quality of the governmental interest which must
appear, the Court has employed a variety of descriptive terms: compelling;
substantial; subordinating; paramount; cogent; strong. Whatever imprecision
inheres in these terms, we think it clear that a government regulation is
sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of the Government; if
it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the
governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if
the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater
than is essential to the furtherance of that interest. We find that the 1965
Amendment to § 12 (b) (3) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act
meets all of these requirements, and consequently that O'Brien can be
constitutionally convicted for violating it.
The constitutional power of Congress to raise and support armies and to make
all laws necessary and proper to that end is broad and sweeping. *** The
issuance of certificates indicating the registration and eligibility classification of
individuals is a legitimate and substantial administrative aid in the functioning

Robson

91

The First Amendment

of this system. And legislation to insure the continuing availability of issued
certificates serves a legitimate and substantial purpose in the system's
administration. ***
We think it apparent that the continuing availability to each registrant of his
Selective Service certificates substantially furthers the smooth and proper
functioning of the system that Congress has established to raise armies. We
think it also apparent that the Nation has a vital interest in having a system for
raising armies that functions with maximum efficiency and is capable of easily
and quickly responding to continually changing circumstances. For these
reasons, the Government has a substantial interest in assuring the continuing
availability of issued Selective Service certificates.
It is equally clear that the 1965 Amendment specifically protects this
substantial governmental interest. We perceive no alternative means that would
more precisely and narrowly assure the continuing availability of issued
Selective Service certificates than a law which prohibits their wilful mutilation
or destruction. The 1965 Amendment prohibits such conduct and does nothing
more. In other words, both the governmental interest and the operation of the
1965 Amendment are limited to the noncommunicative aspect of O'Brien's
conduct. The governmental interest and the scope of the 1965 Amendment are
limited to preventing harm to the smooth and efficient functioning of the
Selective Service System. When O'Brien deliberately rendered unavailable his
registration certificate, he wilfully frustrated this governmental interest. For this
noncommunicative impact of his conduct, and for nothing else, he was
convicted. ***
In conclusion, we find that because of the Government's substantial interest in
assuring the continuing availability of issued Selective Service certificates,
because amended § 462 (b) is an appropriately narrow means of protecting this
interest and condemns only the independent noncommunicative impact of
conduct within its reach, and because the noncommunicative impact of
O'Brien's act of burning his registration certificate frustrated the Government's
interest, a sufficient governmental interest has been shown to justify O'Brien's
conviction.
III.
O'Brien finally argues that the 1965 Amendment is unconstitutional as enacted
because what he calls the "purpose" of Congress was "to suppress freedom of
speech." We reject this argument because under settled principles the purpose
of Congress, as O'Brien uses that term, is not a basis for declaring this
legislation unconstitutional. ***
We think it not amiss, in passing, to comment upon O'Brien's legislativepurpose argument. There was little floor debate on this legislation in either
House. Only Senator Thurmond commented on its substantive features in the
Senate. 111 Cong. Rec. 19746, 20433. After his brief statement, and without
any additional substantive comments, the bill, H. R. 10306, passed the Senate.
111 Cong. Rec. 20434. In the House debate only two Congressmen addressed
themselves to the Amendment— Congressmen Rivers and Bray. 111 Cong. Rec.
19871, 19872. The bill was passed after their statements without any further
debate by a vote of 393 to 1. It is principally on the basis of the statements by

Robson

92

The First Amendment

these three Congressmen that O'Brien makes his congressional-"purpose"
argument. We note that if we were to examine legislative purpose in the instant
case, we would be obliged to consider not only these statements but also the
more authoritative reports of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees.
The portions of those reports explaining the purpose of the Amendment are
reproduced in the Appendix in their entirety. While both reports make clear a
concern with the "defiant" destruction of so-called "draft cards" and with "open"
encouragement to others to destroy their cards, both reports also indicate that
this concern stemmed from an apprehension that unrestrained destruction of
cards would disrupt the smooth functioning of the Selective Service System.
IV.
Since the 1965 Amendment to § 12 (b) (3) of the Universal Military Training and
Service Act is constitutional as enacted and as applied *** we vacate the
judgment of the Court of Appeals, and reinstate the judgment and sentence of
the District Court. ***
It is so ordered.

Spence	  v.	  Washington	  	  
418 U.S. 405 (1974)

PER CURIAM. DOUGLAS, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION. BURGER, C.J. FILED A DISSENTING
OPINION. REHNQUIST, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH BURGER, C.J., AND WHITE, J.,
JOINED.

PER CURIAM.
Appellant displayed a United States flag, which he owned, out of the window of
his apartment. Affixed to both surfaces of the flag was a large peace symbol
fashioned of removable tape. Appellant was convicted under a Washington
statute forbidding the exhibition of a United States flag to which is attached or
superimposed figures, symbols, or other extraneous material. The Supreme
Court of Washington affirmed appellant's conviction. It rejected appellant's
contentions that the statute under which he was charged, on its face and as
applied, contravened the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth
Amendment, and was void for vagueness. *** We reverse on the ground that as
applied to appellant's activity the Washington statute impermissibly infringed
protected expression.
I
On May 10, 1970, appellant, a college student, hung his United States flag from
the window of his apartment on private property in Seattle, Washington. The
flag was upside down, and attached to the front and back was a peace symbol
(i. e., a circle enclosing a trident) made of removable black tape. The window
was above the ground floor. The flag measured approximately three by five feet
and was plainly visible to passersby. The peace symbol occupied roughly half of
the surface of the flag.

Robson

93

The First Amendment

Three Seattle police officers observed the flag and entered the apartment house.
They were met at the main door by appellant, who said: "I suppose you are here
about the flag. I didn't know there was anything wrong with it. I will take it
down." Appellant permitted the officers to enter his apartment, where they
seized the flag and arrested him. Appellant cooperated with the officers. There
was no disruption or altercation.
Appellant was not charged under Washington's flag-desecration statute. See
Wash. Rev. Code § 9.86.030, as amended. Rather, the State relied on the socalled "improper use" statute, Wash. Rev. Code § 9.86.020. This statute
provides, in pertinent part:
"No person shall, in any manner, for exhibition or display:
"(1) Place or cause to be placed any word, figure, mark, picture, design, drawing
or advertisement of any nature upon any flag, standard, color, ensign or shield
of the United States or of this state . . . or
"(2) Expose to public view any such flag, standard, color, ensign or shield upon
which shall have been printed, painted or otherwise produced, or to which shall
have been attached, appended, affixed or annexed any such word, figure, mark,
picture, design, drawing or advertisement . . . ."

*** [At trial] he testified that he put a peace symbol on the flag and displayed it
to public view as a protest against the invasion of Cambodia and the killings at
Kent State University, events which occurred a few days prior to his arrest. He
said that his purpose was to associate the American flag with peace instead of
war and violence:
"I felt there had been so much killing and that this was not what America stood
for. I felt that the flag stood for America and I wanted people to know that I
thought America stood for peace."

Appellant further testified that he chose to fashion the peace symbol from tape
so that it could be removed without damaging the flag. The State made no effort
to controvert any of appellant's testimony.
The trial court instructed the jury in essence that the mere act of displaying the
flag with the peace symbol attached, if proved beyond a reasonable doubt, was
sufficient to convict. There was no requirement of specific intent to do anything
more than display the flag in that manner. The jury returned a verdict of guilty.
The court sentenced appellant to 10 days in jail, suspended, and to a $75 fine.
The Washington Court of Appeals reversed the conviction. It held the improperuse statute overbroad and invalid on its face under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. With one justice dissenting and two concurring in the result, the
Washington Supreme Court reversed and reinstated the conviction.
II
A number of factors are important in the instant case. First, this was a privately
owned flag. In a technical property sense it was not the property of any
government. We have no doubt that the State or National Governments
constitutionally may forbid anyone from mishandling in any manner a flag that
is public property. But this is a different case. Second, appellant displayed his
flag on private property. He engaged in no trespass or disorderly conduct. Nor is
this a case that might be analyzed in terms of reasonable time, place, or

Robson

94

The First Amendment

manner restraints on access to a public area. Third, the record is devoid of
proof of any risk of breach of the peace. It was not appellant's purpose to incite
violence or even stimulate a public demonstration. There is no evidence that
any crowd gathered or that appellant made any effort to attract attention
beyond hanging the flag out of his own window. Indeed, on the facts stipulated
by the parties there is no evidence that anyone other than the three police
officers observed the flag.
Fourth, the State concedes, as did the Washington Supreme Court, that
appellant engaged in a form of communication. Although the stipulated facts
fail to show that any member of the general public viewed the flag, the State's
concession is inevitable on this record. The undisputed facts are that appellant
"wanted people to know that I thought America stood for peace." To be sure,
appellant did not choose to articulate his views through printed or spoken
words. It is therefore necessary to determine whether his activity was
sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of
the First and Fourteenth Amendments, for as the Court noted in United States
v. O'Brien, "[w]e cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of
conduct can be labeled `speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct
intends thereby to express an idea." But the nature of appellant's activity,
combined with the factual context and environment in which it was
undertaken, lead to the conclusion that he engaged in a form of protected
expression.
The Court for decades has recognized the communicative connotations of the
use of flags. In many of their uses flags are a form of symbolism comprising a
"primitive but effective way of communicating ideas . . . ," and "a short cut from
mind to mind." Board of Education v. Barnette (1943). On this record there can
be little doubt that appellant communicated through the use of symbols. The
symbolism included not only the flag but also the superimposed peace symbol.
Moreover, the context in which a symbol is used for purposes of expression is
important, for the context may give meaning to the symbol. *** In this case,
appellant's activity was roughly simultaneous with and concededly triggered by
the Cambodian incursion and the Kent State tragedy, also issues of great public
moment. A flag bearing a peace symbol and displayed upside down by a
student today might be interpreted as nothing more than bizarre behavior, but
it would have been difficult for the great majority of citizens to miss the drift of
appellant's point at the time that he made it.
It may be noted, further, that this was not an act of mindless nihilism. Rather,
it was a pointed expression of anguish by appellant about the then-current
domestic and foreign affairs of his government. An intent to convey a
particularized message was present, and in the surrounding circumstances the
likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who
viewed it.
We are confronted then with a case of prosecution for the expression of an idea
through activity. Moreover, the activity occurred on private property, rather
than in an environment over which the State by necessity must have certain
supervisory powers unrelated to expression. Accordingly, we must examine with
particular care the interests advanced by appellee to support its prosecution.

Robson

95

The First Amendment

*** [The] state court's thesis [was] that Washington has an interest in preserving
the national flag as an unalloyed symbol of our country. The court did not
define this interest; it simply asserted it. Mr. Justice Rehnquist's dissenting
opinion today, adopts essentially the same approach. Presumably, this interest
might be seen as an effort to prevent the appropriation of a revered national
symbol by an individual, interest group, or enterprise where there was a risk
that association of the symbol with a particular product or viewpoint might be
taken erroneously as evidence of governmental endorsement. Alternatively, it
might be argued that the interest asserted by the state court is based on the
uniquely universal character of the national flag as a symbol. For the great
majority of us, the flag is a symbol of patriotism, of pride in the history of our
country, and of the service, sacrifice, and valor of the millions of Americans who
in peace and war have joined together to build and to defend a Nation in which
self-government and personal liberty endure. It evidences both the unity and
diversity which are America. For others the flag carries in varying degrees a
different message. "A person gets from a symbol the meaning he puts into it,
and what is one man's comfort and inspiration is another's jest and scorn."
Board of Education v. Barnette. It might be said that we all draw something
from our national symbol, for it is capable of conveying simultaneously a
spectrum of meanings. If it may be destroyed or permanently disfigured, it
could be argued that it will lose its capability of mirroring the sentiments of all
who view it.
But we need not decide in this case whether the interest advanced by the court
below is valid. We assume, arguendo, that it is. The statute is nonetheless
unconstitutional as applied to appellant's activity. There was no risk that
appellant's acts would mislead viewers into assuming that the Government
endorsed his viewpoint. To the contrary, he was plainly and peacefully
protesting the fact that it did not. Appellant was not charged under the
desecration statute nor did he permanently disfigure the flag or destroy it. He
displayed it as a flag of his country in a way closely analogous to the manner in
which flags have always been used to convey ideas. Moreover, his message was
direct, likely to be understood, and within the contours of the First Amendment.
Given the protected character of his expression and in light of the fact that no
interest the State may have in preserving the physical integrity of a privately
owned flag was significantly impaired on these facts, the conviction must be
invalidated.
The judgment is reversed.
It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND MR. JUSTICE WHITE
JOIN, DISSENTING.
The Court holds that a Washington statute prohibiting persons from attaching
material to the American flag was unconstitutionally applied to appellant.
Although I agree with the Court that appellant's activity was a form of
communication, I do not agree that the First Amendment prohibits the State
from restricting this activity in furtherance of other important interests. And I
believe the rationale by which the Court reaches its conclusion is unsound.

Robson

96

The First Amendment

"[T]he right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all
circumstances." Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942). This Court has long
recognized, for example, that some forms of expression are not entitled to any
protection at all under the First Amendment, despite the fact that they could
reasonably be thought protected under its literal language. See Roth v. United
States (1957). The Court has further recognized that even protected speech may
be subject to reasonable limitation when important countervailing interests are
involved. Citizens are not completely free to commit perjury, to libel other
citizens, to infringe copyrights, to incite riots, or to interfere unduly with
passage through a public thoroughfare. The right of free speech, though
precious, remains subject to reasonable accommodation to other valued
interests.
Since a State concededly may impose some limitations on speech directly, it
would seem to follow a fortiori that a State may legislate to protect important
state interests even though an incidental limitation on free speech results.
Virtually any law enacted by a State, when viewed with sufficient ingenuity,
could be thought to interfere with some citizen's preferred means of expression.
But no one would argue, I presume, that a State could not prevent the painting
of public buildings simply because a particular class of protesters believed their
message would best be conveyed through that medium. Had appellant here
chosen to tape his peace symbol to a federal courthouse, I have little doubt that
he could be prosecuted under a statute properly drawn to protect public
property.
Yet the Court today holds that the State of Washington cannot limit use of the
American flag, at least insofar as its statute prevents appellant from using a
privately owned flag to convey his personal message. Expressing its willingness
to assume, arguendo, that Washington has a valid interest in preserving the
integrity of the flag, the Court nevertheless finds that interest to be insufficient
in this case. To achieve this result the Court first devalues the State's interest
under these circumstances, noting that "no interest the State may have in
preserving the physical integrity of a privately owned flag was significantly
impaired on these facts . . . ." The Court takes pains to point out that appellant
did not "permanently disfigure the flag or destroy it," and emphasizes that the
flag was displayed "in a way closely analogous to the manner in which flags
have always been used to convey ideas." The Court then restates the notion that
such state interests are secondary to messages which are "direct, likely to be
understood, and within the contours of the First Amendment." In my view the
first premise demonstrates a total misunderstanding of the State's interest in
the integrity of the American flag, and the second premise places the Court in
the position either of ultimately favoring appellant's message because of its
subject matter, a position about which almost all members of the majority have
only recently expressed doubt, or, alternatively, of making the flag available for
a limitless succession of political and commercial messages. ***
What appellant here seeks is simply license to use the flag however he pleases,
so long as the activity can be tied to a concept of speech, regardless of any state
interest in having the flag used only for more limited purposes. I find no
reasoning in the Court's opinion which convinces me that the Constitution
requires such license to be given.

The First Amendment

The fact that the State has a valid interest in preserving the character of the
flag does not mean, of course, that it can employ all conceivable means to
enforce it. It certainly could not require all citizens to own the flag or compel
citizens to salute one. Board of Education v. Barnette (1943). It presumably
cannot punish criticism of the flag, or the principles for which it stands, any
more than it could punish criticism of this country's policies or ideas. But the
statute in this case demands no such allegiance. Its operation does not depend
upon whether the flag is used for communicative or noncommunicative
purposes; upon whether a particular message is deemed commercial or
political; upon whether the use of the flag is respectful or contemptuous; or
upon whether any particular segment of the State's citizenry might applaud or
oppose the intended message. It simply withdraws a unique national symbol
from the roster of materials that may be used as a background for
communications. Since I do not believe the Constitution prohibits Washington
from making that decision, I dissent.

DISSENTING OPINION.

JUSTICE BRENNAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
After publicly burning an American flag as a means of political protest, Gregory
Lee Johnson was convicted of desecrating a flag in violation of Texas law. This
case presents the question whether his conviction is consistent with the First
Amendment. We hold that it is not.
I
While the Republican National Convention was taking place in Dallas in 1984,
respondent Johnson participated in a political demonstration dubbed the
"Republican War Chest Tour." As explained in literature distributed by the
demonstrators and in speeches made by them, the purpose of this event was to
protest the policies of the Reagan administration and of certain Dallas-based
corporations. The demonstrators marched through the Dallas streets, chanting
political slogans and stopping at several corporate locations to stage "die-ins"
intended to dramatize the consequences of nuclear war. On several occasions
they spray-painted the walls of buildings and overturned potted plants, but
Johnson himself took no part in such activities. He did, however, accept an
American flag handed to him by a fellow protestor who had taken it from a
flagpole outside one of the targeted buildings.
The demonstration ended in front of Dallas City Hall, where Johnson unfurled
the American flag, doused it with kerosene, and set it on fire. While the flag
burned, the protestors chanted: "America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on

Robson

98

The First Amendment

you." After the demonstrators dispersed, a witness to the flag burning collected
the flag's remains and buried them in his backyard. No one was physically
injured or threatened with injury, though several witnesses testified that they
had been seriously offended by the flag burning.
Of the approximately 100 demonstrators, Johnson alone was charged with a
crime. The only criminal offense with which he was charged was the desecration
of a venerated object in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. 42.09(a)(3) (1989).
After a trial, he was convicted, sentenced to one year in prison, and fined
$2,000. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas at Dallas affirmed
Johnson's conviction, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed,
holding that the State could not, consistent with the First Amendment, punish
Johnson for burning the flag in these circumstances. *** Because it reversed
Johnson's conviction on the ground that 42.09 was unconstitutional as applied
to him, the state court did not address Johnson's argument that the statute
was, on its face, unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. We granted certiorari
and now affirm.
II
Johnson was convicted of flag desecration for burning the flag rather than for
uttering insulting words. This fact somewhat complicates our consideration of
his conviction under the First Amendment. We must first determine whether
Johnson's burning of the flag constituted expressive conduct, permitting him to
invoke the First Amendment in challenging his conviction. See, e. g., Spence v.
Washington (1974). If his conduct was expressive, we next decide whether the
State's regulation is related to the suppression of free expression. See, e. g.,
United States v. O'Brien (1968); Spence. If the State's regulation is not related to
expression, then the less stringent standard we announced in United States v.
O'Brien for regulations of noncommunicative conduct controls. If it is, then we
are outside of O'Brien's test, and we must ask whether this interest justifies
Johnson's conviction under a more demanding standard. A third possibility is
that the State's asserted interest is simply not implicated on these facts, and in
that event the interest drops out of the picture.
The First Amendment literally forbids the abridgment only of "speech," but we
have long recognized that its protection does not end at the spoken or written
word. While we have rejected "the view that an apparently limitless variety of
conduct can be labeled `speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct
intends thereby to express an idea," O'Brien, we have acknowledged that
conduct may be "sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall
within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments," Spence.
In deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative
elements to bring the First Amendment into play, we have asked whether "[a]n
intent to convey a particularized message was present, and [whether] the
likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who
viewed it." Spence. Hence, we have recognized the expressive nature of students'
wearing of black armbands to protest American military involvement in
Vietnam, Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist. (1969); of a
sit-in by blacks in a "whites only" area to protest segregation, Brown v.
Louisiana (1966); of the wearing of American military uniforms in a dramatic

Robson

99

The First Amendment

presentation criticizing American involvement in Vietnam, Schacht v. United
States (1970); and of picketing about a wide variety of causes.
Especially pertinent to this case are our decisions recognizing the
communicative nature of conduct relating to flags. That we have had little
difficulty identifying an expressive element in conduct relating to flags should
not be surprising. The very purpose of a national flag is to serve as a symbol of
our country; it is, one might say, "the one visible manifestation of two hundred
years of nationhood." *** Pregnant with expressive content, the flag as readily
signifies this Nation as does the combination of letters found in "America."
***The State of Texas conceded for purposes of its oral argument in this case
that Johnson's conduct was expressive conduct, and this concession seems to
us as prudent as was Washington's in Spence. Johnson burned an American
flag as part - indeed, as the culmination - of a political demonstration that
coincided with the convening of the Republican Party and its renomination of
Ronald Reagan for President. The expressive, overtly political nature of this
conduct was both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent. ***
III
The government generally has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct
than it has in restricting the written or spoken word. See O'Brien. It may not,
however, proscribe particular conduct because it has expressive elements. *** It
is, in short, not simply the verbal or nonverbal nature of the expression, but the
governmental interest at stake, that helps to determine whether a restriction on
that expression is valid.
Thus, although we have recognized that where "`speech' and `nonspeech'
elements are combined in the same course of conduct, a sufficiently important
governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify
incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms," O'Brien, we have limited
the applicability of O'Brien's relatively lenient standard to those cases in which
"the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression.”
[We] have highlighted the requirement that the governmental interest in
question be unconnected to expression in order to come under O'Brien's less
demanding rule.
In order to decide whether O'Brien's test applies here, therefore, we must decide
whether Texas has asserted an interest in support of Johnson's conviction that
is unrelated to the suppression of expression. If we find that an interest
asserted by the State is simply not implicated on the facts before us, we need
not ask whether O'Brien's test applies. The State offers two separate interests to
justify this conviction: preventing breaches of the peace and preserving the flag
as a symbol of nationhood and national unity. We hold that the first interest is
not implicated on this record and that the second is related to the suppression
of expression.
A
Texas claims that its interest in preventing breaches of the peace justifies
Johnson's conviction for flag desecration. However, no disturbance of the peace
actually occurred or threatened to occur because of Johnson's burning of the
flag. Although the State stresses the disruptive behavior of the protestors

Robson

100

The First Amendment

during their march toward City Hall, it admits that "no actual breach of the
peace occurred at the time of the flagburning or in response to the flagburning."
*** The State's position, therefore, amounts to a claim that an audience that
takes serious offense at particular expression is necessarily likely to disturb the
peace and that the expression may be prohibited on this basis. Our precedents
do not countenance such a presumption. ***
Thus, we have not permitted the government to assume that every expression of
a provocative idea will incite a riot, but have instead required careful
consideration of the actual circumstances surrounding such expression, asking
whether the expression "is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless
action and is likely to incite or produce such action." Brandenburg v. Ohio
(1969). To accept Texas' arguments that it need only demonstrate "the potential
for a breach of the peace," and that every flag burning necessarily possesses
that potential, would be to eviscerate our holding in Brandenburg. This we
decline to do.
Nor does Johnson's expressive conduct fall within that small class of "fighting
words" that are "likely to provoke the average person to retaliation, and thereby
cause a breach of the peace." Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942). ***
We thus conclude that the State's interest in maintaining order is not
implicated on these facts. The State need not worry that our holding will disable
it from preserving the peace. We do not suggest that the First Amendment
forbids a State to prevent "imminent lawless action." Brandenburg. And, in fact,
Texas already has a statute specifically prohibiting breaches of the peace, which
tends to confirm that Texas need not punish this flag desecration in order to
keep the peace.
B
The State also asserts an interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of
nationhood and national unity. In Spence, we acknowledged that the
government's interest in preserving the flag's special symbolic value "is directly
related to expression in the context of activity" such as affixing a peace symbol
to a flag. We are equally persuaded that this interest is related to expression in
the case of Johnson's burning of the flag. The State, apparently, is concerned
that such conduct will lead people to believe either that the flag does not stand
for nationhood and national unity, but instead reflects other, less positive
concepts, or that the concepts reflected in the flag do not in fact exist, that is,
that we do not enjoy unity as a Nation. These concerns blossom only when a
person's treatment of the flag communicates some message, and thus are
related "to the suppression of free expression" within the meaning of O'Brien.
We are thus outside of O'Brien's test altogether.
IV
It remains to consider whether the State's interest in preserving the flag as a
symbol of nationhood and national unity justifies Johnson's conviction.
***Johnson was not, we add, prosecuted for the expression of just any idea; he
was prosecuted for his expression of dissatisfaction with the policies of this
country, expression situated at the core of our First Amendment values.

Robson

101

The First Amendment

Moreover, Johnson was prosecuted because he knew that his politically charged
expression would cause "serious offense." If he had burned the flag as a means
of disposing of it because it was dirty or torn, he would not have been convicted
of flag desecration under this Texas law: federal law designates burning as the
preferred means of disposing of a flag "when it is in such condition that it is no
longer a fitting emblem for display," 36 U.S.C. 176(k), and Texas has no quarrel
with this means of disposal. The Texas law is thus not aimed at protecting the
physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances, but is designed instead to
protect it only against impairments that would cause serious offense to others.
Texas concedes as much. *** Johnson's political expression was restricted
because of the content of the message he conveyed. We must therefore subject
the State's asserted interest in preserving the special symbolic character of the
flag to "the most exacting scrutiny."
Texas argues that its interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood
and national unity survives this close analysis. Quoting extensively from the
writings of this Court chronicling the flag's historic and symbolic role in our
society, the State emphasizes the "`special place'" reserved for the flag in our
Nation.
The State's argument is not that it has an interest simply in
maintaining the flag as a symbol of something, no matter what it symbolizes;
indeed, if that were the State's position, it would be difficult to see how that
interest is endangered by highly symbolic conduct such as Johnson's. Rather,
the State's claim is that it has an interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of
nationhood and national unity, a symbol with a determinate range of meanings.
According to Texas, if one physically treats the flag in a way that would tend to
cast doubt on either the idea that nationhood and national unity are the flag's
referents or that national unity actually exists, the message conveyed thereby is
a harmful one and therefore may be prohibited.
If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the
government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society
finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.
We have not recognized an exception to this principle even where our flag has
been involved. ***
In short, nothing in our precedents suggests that a State may foster its own
view of the flag by prohibiting expressive conduct relating to it. To bring its
argument outside our precedents, Texas attempts to convince us that even if its
interest in preserving the flag's symbolic role does not allow it to prohibit words
or some expressive conduct critical of the flag, it does permit it to forbid the
outright destruction of the flag. The State's argument cannot depend here on
the distinction between written or spoken words and nonverbal conduct. That
distinction, we have shown, is of no moment where the nonverbal conduct is
expressive, as it is here, and where the regulation of that conduct is related to
expression, as it is here. In addition, both Barnette and Spence involved
expressive conduct, not only verbal communication, and both found that
conduct protected.
Texas' focus on the precise nature of Johnson's expression, moreover, misses
the point of our prior decisions: their enduring lesson, that the government may
not prohibit expression simply because it disagrees with its message, is not

Robson

102

The First Amendment

dependent on the particular mode in which one chooses to express an idea. If
we were to hold that a State may forbid flag burning wherever it is likely to
endanger the flag's symbolic role, but allow it wherever burning a flag promotes
that role - as where, for example, a person ceremoniously burns a dirty flag - we
would be saying that when it comes to impairing the flag's physical integrity,
the flag itself may be used as a symbol - as a substitute for the written or
spoken word or a "short cut from mind to mind" - only in one direction. We
would be permitting a State to "prescribe what shall be orthodox" by saying that
one may burn the flag to convey one's attitude toward it and its referents only if
one does not endanger the flag's representation of nationhood and national
unity.
We never before have held that the Government may ensure that a symbol be
used to express only one view of that symbol or its referents. ***
There is, moreover, no indication - either in the text of the Constitution or in
our cases interpreting it - that a separate juridical category exists for the
American flag alone. Indeed, we would not be surprised to learn that the
persons who framed our Constitution and wrote the Amendment that we now
construe were not known for their reverence for the Union Jack. The First
Amendment does not guarantee that other concepts virtually sacred to our
Nation as a whole - such as the principle that discrimination on the basis of
race is odious and destructive - will go unquestioned in the marketplace of
ideas. See Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969). We decline, therefore, to create for the
flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.
It is not the State's ends, but its means, to which we object. It cannot be
gainsaid that there is a special place reserved for the flag in this Nation, and
thus we do not doubt that the government has a legitimate interest in making
efforts to "preserv[e] the national flag as an unalloyed symbol of our country."
Spence. We reject the suggestion, urged at oral argument by counsel for
Johnson, that the government lacks "any state interest whatsoever" in
regulating the manner in which the flag may be displayed. Congress has, for
example, enacted precatory regulations describing the proper treatment of the
flag, and we cast no doubt on the legitimacy of its interest in making such
recommendations. To say that the government has an interest in encouraging
proper treatment of the flag, however, is not to say that it may criminally
punish a person for burning a flag as a means of political protest. "National
unity as an end which officials may foster by persuasion and example is not in
question. The problem is whether under our Constitution compulsion as here
employed is a permissible means for its achievement." Barnette.
We are fortified in today's conclusion by our conviction that forbidding criminal
punishment for conduct such as Johnson's will not endanger the special role
played by our flag or the feelings it inspires. To paraphrase Justice Holmes, we
submit that nobody can suppose that this one gesture of an unknown man will
change our Nation's attitude towards its flag. See Abrams v. United States (1919)
(Holmes, J., dissenting). ***
We are tempted to say, in fact, that the flag's deservedly cherished place in our
community will be strengthened, not weakened, by our holding today. Our
decision is a reaffirmation of the principles of freedom and inclusiveness that

Robson

103

The First Amendment

the flag best reflects, and of the conviction that our toleration of criticism such
as Johnson's is a sign and source of our strength. Indeed, one of the proudest
images of our flag, the one immortalized in our own national anthem, is of the
bombardment it survived at Fort McHenry. It is the Nation's resilience, not its
rigidity, that Texas sees reflected in the flag - and it is that resilience that we
reassert today.
The way to preserve the flag's special role is not to punish those who feel
differently about these matters. It is to persuade them that they are wrong. "To
courageous, self-reliant men, with confidence in the power of free and fearless
reasoning applied through the processes of popular government, no danger
flowing from speech can be deemed clear and present, unless the incidence of
the evil apprehended is so imminent that it may befall before there is
opportunity for full discussion. If there be time to expose through discussion
the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the
remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence." Whitney v. California
(1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). And, precisely because it is our flag that is
involved, one's response to the flag burner may exploit the uniquely persuasive
power of the flag itself. We can imagine no more appropriate response to
burning a flag than waving one's own, no better way to counter a flag burner's
message than by saluting the flag that burns, no surer means of preserving the
dignity even of the flag that burned than by - as one witness here did according its remains a respectful burial. We do not consecrate the flag by
punishing its desecration, for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this
cherished emblem represents.
V
Johnson was convicted for engaging in expressive conduct. The State's interest
in preventing breaches of the peace does not support his conviction because
Johnson's conduct did not threaten to disturb the peace. Nor does the State's
interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity
justify his criminal conviction for engaging in political expression. The judgment
of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is therefore
Affirmed.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, WITH WHOM JUSTICE WHITE AND JUSTICE O'CONNOR
JOIN, DISSENTING.
In holding this Texas statute unconstitutional, the Court ignores Justice
Holmes' familiar aphorism that "a page of history is worth a volume of logic."
For more than 200 years, the American flag has occupied a unique position as
the symbol of our Nation, a uniqueness that justifies a governmental
prohibition against flag burning in the way respondent Johnson did here. ***
The American flag, then, throughout more than 200 years of our history, has
come to be the visible symbol embodying our Nation. It does not represent the
views of any particular political party, and it does not represent any particular
political philosophy. The flag is not simply another "idea" or "point of view"
competing for recognition in the marketplace of ideas. Millions and millions of
Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence regardless of what sort of

Robson

104

The First Amendment

social, political, or philosophical beliefs they may have. I cannot agree that the
First Amendment invalidates the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50
States, which make criminal the public burning of the flag. ***
Our Constitution wisely places limits on powers of legislative majorities to act,
but the declaration of such limits by this Court "is, at all times, a question of
much delicacy, which ought seldom, if ever, to be decided in the affirmative, in
a doubtful case." Fletcher v. Peck (1810) (Marshall, C. J.). Uncritical extension of
constitutional protection to the burning of the flag risks the frustration of the
very purpose for which organized governments are instituted. The Court decides
that the American flag is just another symbol, about which not only must
opinions pro and con be tolerated, but for which the most minimal public
respect may not be enjoined. The government may conscript men into the
Armed Forces where they must fight and perhaps die for the flag, but the
government may not prohibit the public burning of the banner under which
they fight. I would uphold the Texas statute as applied in this case.
STEVENS, J., DISSENTING.
As the Court analyzes this case, it presents the question whether the State of
Texas, or indeed the Federal Government, has the power to prohibit the public
desecration of the American flag. The question is unique. In my judgment rules
that apply to a host of other symbols, such as state flags, armbands, or various
privately promoted emblems of political or commercial identity, are not
necessarily controlling. Even if flag burning could be considered just another
species of symbolic speech under the logical application of the rules that the
Court has developed in its interpretation of the First Amendment in other
contexts, this case has an intangible dimension that makes those rules
inapplicable.
A country's flag is a symbol of more than "nationhood and national unity." It
also signifies the ideas that characterize the society that has chosen that
emblem as well as the special history that has animated the growth and power
of those ideas. The fleurs-de-lis and the tricolor both symbolized "nationhood
and national unity," but they had vastly different meanings. The message
conveyed by some flags - the swastika, for example - may survive long after it
has outlived its usefulness as a symbol of regimented unity in a particular
nation.
So it is with the American flag. It is more than a proud symbol of the courage,
the determination, and the gifts of nature that transformed 13 fledgling
Colonies into a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of
religious tolerance, and of good will for other peoples who share our aspirations.
The symbol carries its message to dissidents both at home and abroad who may
have no interest at all in our national unity or survival.
The value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured. Even so, I have no doubt
that the interest in preserving that value for the future is both significant and
legitimate. Conceivably that value will be enhanced by the Court's conclusion
that our national commitment to free expression is so strong that even the

Robson

105

The First Amendment

United States as ultimate guarantor of that freedom is without power to
prohibit the desecration of its unique symbol. But I am unpersuaded. The
creation of a federal right to post bulletin boards and graffiti on the Washington
Monument might enlarge the market for free expression, but at a cost I would
not pay. Similarly, in my considered judgment, sanctioning the public
desecration of the flag will tarnish its value - both for those who cherish the
ideas for which it waves and for those who desire to don the robes of martyrdom
by burning it. That tarnish is not justified by the trivial burden on free
expression occasioned by requiring that an available, alternative mode of
expression - including uttering words critical of the flag, be employed.
It is appropriate to emphasize certain propositions that are not implicated by
this case. The statutory prohibition of flag desecration does not "prescribe what
shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion
or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein." West Virginia
Board of Education v. Barnette (1943). The statute does not compel any
conduct or any profession of respect for any idea or any symbol.
Nor does the statute violate "the government's paramount obligation of
neutrality in its regulation of protected communication." Young v. American
Mini Theatres, Inc. (1976) (plurality opinion). The content of respondent's
message has no relevance whatsoever to the case. The concept of "desecration"
does not turn on the substance of the message the actor intends to convey, but
rather on whether those who view the act will take serious offense. Accordingly,
one intending to convey a message of respect for the flag by burning it in a
public square might nonetheless be guilty of desecration if he knows that others
- perhaps simply because they misperceive the intended message - will be
seriously offended. Indeed, even if the actor knows that all possible witnesses
will understand that he intends to send a message of respect, he might still be
guilty of desecration if he also knows that this understanding does not lessen
the offense taken by some of those witnesses. Thus, this is not a case in which
the fact that "it is the speaker's opinion that gives offense" provides a special
"reason for according it constitutional protection," FCC v. Pacifica Foundation
(1978) (plurality opinion). The case has nothing to do with "disagreeable ideas."
It involves disagreeable conduct that, in my opinion, diminishes the value of an
important national asset.
The Court is therefore quite wrong in blandly asserting that respondent "was
prosecuted for his expression of dissatisfaction with the policies of this country,
expression situated at the core of our First Amendment values." Respondent
was prosecuted because of the method he chose to express his dissatisfaction
with those policies. Had he chosen to spray-paint - or perhaps convey with a
motion picture projector - his message of dissatisfaction on the facade of the
Lincoln Memorial, there would be no question about the power of the
Government to prohibit his means of expression. The prohibition would be
supported by the legitimate interest in preserving the quality of an important
national asset. Though the asset at stake in this case is intangible, given its
unique value, the same interest supports a prohibition on the desecration of the
American flag. *

Robson

106

The First Amendment

The ideas of liberty and equality have been an irresistible force in motivating
leaders like Patrick Henry, Susan B. Anthony, and Abraham Lincoln,
schoolteachers like Nathan Hale and Booker T. Washington, the Philippine
Scouts who fought at Bataan, and the soldiers who scaled the bluff at Omaha
Beach. If those ideas are worth fighting for - and our history demonstrates that
they are - it cannot be true that the flag that uniquely symbolizes their power is
not itself worthy of protection from unnecessary desecration.
I respectfully dissent.
[ Footnote * ] The Court suggests that a prohibition against flag desecration is not
content neutral because this form of symbolic speech is only used by persons who are
critical of the flag or the ideas it represents. In making this suggestion the Court does
not pause to consider the far-reaching consequences of its introduction of disparateimpact analysis into our First Amendment jurisprudence. It seems obvious that a
prohibition against the desecration of a gravesite is content neutral even if it denies
some protesters the right to make a symbolic statement by extinguishing the flame in
Arlington Cemetery where John F. Kennedy is buried while permitting others to salute
the flame by bowing their heads. Few would doubt that a protester who extinguishes
the flame has desecrated the gravesite, regardless of whether he prefaces that act with a
speech explaining that his purpose is to express deep admiration or unmitigated scorn
for the late President. Likewise, few would claim that the protester who bows his head
has desecrated the gravesite, even if he makes clear that his purpose is to show
disrespect. In such a case, as in a flag burning case, the prohibition against desecration
has absolutely nothing to do with the content of the message that the symbolic speech
is intended to convey.

Notes	  
1.
Is the American flag unique? Does the difference of opinion on this
issue fully explain the contrary conclusions of the Court and the
dissents?
Note that Congress reacted to Texas v. Johnson by passing the Flag
Protection Act of 1989, 103 Stat. 777, 18 U.S.C. § 700, which the Court
held unconstitutional in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990).
The House of Representatives has passed a resolution to amend the
United States Constitution, The Flag Desecration Amendment, to
specifically permit Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the physical
desecration of the flag of the United States, but the proposed
Constitutional amendment has not been enthusiastically advanced.
2.
What is the O’Brien standard?
Why did the Court find it
inapplicable in Texas v. Johnson? What is the argument that the O’Brien
standard should not have been applicable in O’Brien?
3.
What is the Spence test? How does it apply in the context of public
school dress codes that prohibit “saggy pants,” “gang attire,” fishnet
tights, gender non-conforming clothes or males wearing facial make-up?

How does a specific prohibition influence the analysis of whether an
“expression” is sufficient under Spence?

Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393
U.S. 503 (1969), involved students wearing black armbands which the
Court held was expressive conduct. This important case is included in
the chapter on Government as Employer and Educator.
5.
In Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288
(1984), the Court assumed but did not decide that sleeping could be
expressive conduct. The context was a challenge to a National Park
Service regulation prohibiting camping in certain parks as applied to
prohibit demonstrators from sleeping in D.C.’s Lafayette Park and the
Mall in connection with a demonstration intended to call attention to the
plight of the homeless. The National Park Service allowed “symbolic
tents” but disallowed sleeping in those tents. The Court found that there
was a substantial governmental interest (preserving park property)
unrelated to the suppression of the arguably protected expressive
sleeping and upheld the park regulation.

Clark was central to some of the First Amendment litigation
surrounding “Occupy” in 2011. At least one district judge determined
that sleeping was expressive conduct.
The Court finds that in the context of this case the tenting and sleeping in the
park as described by plaintiffs' counsel is symbolic conduct which is protected
by the First Amendment. The conduct of tenting and sleeping in the park 24
hours a day to simulate an “occupation” is intended to be communicative and in
context is reasonably understood by the viewer to be communicative. This
expressive conduct relates to matters of public concern because it can be fairly
considered as relating to matters of political, social, or other concern to the
community and is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the
public.

SOUTER, AND THOMAS, JJ., JOINED. WHITE, J., FILED AN OPINION CONCURRING IN THE
JUDGMENT, IN WHICH BLACKMUN AND O'CONNOR, JJ., JOINED, AND IN WHICH STEVENS, J.,

STEVENS, J., FILED AN OPINION CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT, IN PART I OF WHICH WHITE AND
BLACKMUN, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE SCALIA DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
In the predawn hours of June 21, 1990, petitioner and several other teenagers
allegedly assembled a crudely made cross by taping together broken chair legs.
They then allegedly burned the cross inside the fenced yard of a black family
that lived across the street from the house where petitioner was staying.
Although this conduct could have been punished under any of a number of
laws, one of the two provisions under which respondent city of St. Paul chose to
charge petitioner (then a juvenile) was the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime
Ordinance, St. Paul, Minn., Legis. Code 292.02 (1990), which provides:
"Whoever places on public or private property a symbol, object, appellation,
characterization or graffiti, including, but not limited to, a burning cross or Nazi
swastika, which one knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger,
alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or
gender commits disorderly conduct and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."

Petitioner moved to dismiss this count on the ground that the St. Paul
ordinance was substantially overbroad and impermissibly content based, and
therefore facially invalid under the First Amendment. The trial court granted
this motion, but the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed. That court rejected
petitioner's overbreadth claim because, as construed in prior Minnesota cases,
the modifying phrase "arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others" limited the
reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounts to "fighting words," i.e.,
"conduct that itself inflicts injury or tends to incite immediate violence . . . ,"
and therefore the ordinance reached only expression "that the first amendment
does not protect.” The court also concluded that the ordinance was not
impermissibly content based because, in its view, "the ordinance is a narrowly
tailored means toward accomplishing the compelling governmental interest in
protecting the community against bias-motivated threats to public safety and
order." We granted certiorari.

The First Amendment

I
In construing the St. Paul ordinance, we are bound by the construction given to
it by the Minnesota court. Accordingly, we accept the Minnesota Supreme
Court's authoritative statement that the ordinance reaches only those
expressions that constitute "fighting words" within the meaning of Chaplinsky.
Petitioner and his amici urge us to modify the scope of the Chaplinsky
formulation, thereby invalidating the ordinance as "substantially overbroad."
We find it unnecessary to consider this issue. Assuming, arguendo, that all of
the expression reached by the ordinance is proscribable under the "fighting
words" doctrine, we nonetheless conclude that the ordinance is facially
unconstitutional in that it prohibits otherwise permitted speech solely on the
basis of the subjects the speech addresses.
The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing speech
or even expressive conduct because of disapproval of the ideas expressed.
Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid. From 1791 to the present,
however, our society, like other free but civilized societies, has permitted
restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are "of
such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived
from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality."
Chaplinsky. We have recognized that "the freedom of speech" referred to by the
First Amendment does not include a freedom to disregard these traditional
limitations. See, e.g., Roth v. United States (1957) (obscenity); Beauharnais v.
Illinois (1952) (defamation); Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire ("fighting' words").
Our decisions since the 1960's have narrowed the scope of the traditional
categorical exceptions for defamation, see New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964);
Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974) and for obscenity, see Miller v. California
(1973), but a limited categorical approach has remained an important part of
our First Amendment jurisprudence.
We have sometimes said that these categories of expression are "not within the
area of constitutionally protected speech," or that the "protection of the First
Amendment does not extend" to them. Such statements must be taken in
context, however, and are no more literally true than is the occasionally
repeated shorthand characterizing obscenity "as not being speech at all." What
they mean is that these areas of speech can, consistently with the First
Amendment, be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content
(obscenity, defamation, etc.) - not that they are categories of speech entirely
invisible to the Constitution, so that they may be made the vehicles for content
discrimination unrelated to their distinctively proscribable content. Thus, the
government may proscribe libel; but it may not make the further content
discrimination of proscribing only libel critical of the government. ***
Our cases surely do not establish the proposition that the First Amendment
imposes no obstacle whatsoever to regulation of particular instances of such
proscribable expression, so that the government "may regulate [them] freely,"
post (White, J., concurring in judgment). That would mean that a city council
could enact an ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene works that
contain criticism of the city government or, indeed, that do not include
endorsement of the city government. Such a simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all
approach to First Amendment protection is at odds with common sense and

Robson

110

The First Amendment

with our jurisprudence as well. It is not true that "fighting words" have at most
a "de minimis" expressive content, or that their content is in all respects
"worthless and undeserving of constitutional protection;” sometimes they are
quite expressive indeed. We have not said that they constitute "no part of the
expression of ideas," but only that they constitute "no essential part of any
exposition of ideas." Chaplinsky (emphasis added).
The proposition that a particular instance of speech can be proscribable on the
basis of one feature (e.g., obscenity) but not on the basis of another (e.g.,
opposition to the city government) is commonplace and has found application in
many contexts. We have long held, for example, that nonverbal expressive
activity can be banned because of the action it entails, but not because of the
ideas it expresses - so that burning a flag in violation of an ordinance against
outdoor fires could be punishable, whereas burning a flag in violation of an
ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not. Similarly, we have upheld
reasonable "time, place, or manner" restrictions, but only if they are "justified
without reference to the content of the regulated speech." Ward v. Rock Against
Racism (1989); see also Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence (1984)
(noting that the O'Brien test differs little from the standard applied to time,
place, or manner restrictions). And just as the power to proscribe particular
speech on the basis of a non-content element (e.g., noise) does not entail the
power to proscribe the same speech on the basis of a content element, so also
the power to proscribe it on the basis of one content element (e.g., obscenity)
does not entail the power to proscribe it on the basis of other content elements.
In other words, the exclusion of "fighting words" from the scope of the First
Amendment simply means that, for purposes of that Amendment, the
unprotected features of the words are, despite their verbal character, essentially
a "nonspeech" element of communication. Fighting words are thus analogous to
a noisy sound truck: each is, as Justice Frankfurter recognized, a "mode of
speech," both can be used to convey an idea; but neither has, in and of itself, a
claim upon the First Amendment. As with the sound truck, however, so also
with fighting words: the government may not regulate use based on hostility or favoritism - towards the underlying message expressed.
The concurrences describe us as setting forth a new First Amendment principle
that prohibition of constitutionally proscribable speech cannot be
"underinclusiv[e]," post (White, J., concurring in judgment) - a First
Amendment "absolutism" whereby "[w]ithin a particular `proscribable' category
of expression, . . . a government must either proscribe all speech or no speech
at all," post (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). That easy target is of the
concurrences' own invention. In our view, the First Amendment imposes not an
"underinclusiveness" limitation, but a "content discrimination" limitation, upon
a State's prohibition of proscribable speech. There is no problem whatever, for
example, with a State's prohibiting obscenity (and other forms of proscribable
expression) only in certain media or markets, for although that prohibition
would be "underinclusive," it would not discriminate on the basis of content.
Even the prohibition against content discrimination that we assert the First
Amendment requires is not absolute. It applies differently in the context of
proscribable speech than in the area of fully protected speech. The rationale of
the general prohibition, after all, is that content discrimination "raises the

Robson

111

The First Amendment

specter that the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints
from the marketplace." But content discrimination among various instances of
a class of proscribable speech often does not pose this threat.
When the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very
reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable, no significant danger
of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists. Such a reason, having been adjudged
neutral enough to support exclusion of the entire class of speech from First
Amendment protection, is also neutral enough to form the basis of distinction
within the class. To illustrate: a State might choose to prohibit only that
obscenity which is the most patently offensive in its prurience - i.e., that which
involves the most lascivious displays of sexual activity. But it may not prohibit,
for example, only that obscenity which includes offensive political messages.
And the Federal Government can criminalize only those threats of violence that
are directed against the President, see 18 U.S.C. 871 - since the reasons why
threats of violence are outside the First Amendment (protecting individuals from
the fear of violence, from the disruption that fear engenders, and from the
possibility that the threatened violence will occur) have special force when
applied to the person of the President. See Watts v. United States (1969)
(upholding the facial validity of 871 because of the "overwhelmin[g] interest in
protecting the safety of [the] Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his
duties without interference from threats of physical violence"). But the Federal
Government may not criminalize only those threats against the President that
mention his policy on aid to inner cities. And to take a final example (one
mentioned by Justice Stevens, post), a State may choose to regulate price
advertising in one industry, but not in others, because the risk of fraud (one of
the characteristics of commercial speech that justifies depriving it of full First
Amendment protection is in its view greater there. But a State may not prohibit
only that commercial advertising that depicts men in a demeaning fashion.
Another valid basis for according differential treatment to even a contentdefined subclass of proscribable speech is that the subclass happens to be
associated with particular "secondary effects" of the speech, so that the
regulation is "justified without reference to the content of the . . . speech." A
State could, for example, permit all obscene live performances except those
involving minors. Moreover, since words can in some circumstances violate laws
directed not against speech but against conduct (a law against treason, for
example, is violated by telling the enemy the Nation's defense secrets), a
particular content-based subcategory of a proscribable class of speech can be
swept up incidentally within the reach of a statute directed at conduct, rather
than speech. Thus, for example, sexually derogatory "fighting words," among
other words, may produce a violation of Title VII's general prohibition against
sexual discrimination in employment practices, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2. Where the
government does not target conduct on the basis of its expressive content, acts
are not shielded from regulation merely because they express a discriminatory
idea or philosophy.
*** There may be other such bases as well. Indeed, to validate such selectivity
(where totally proscribable speech is at issue), it may not even be necessary to
identify any particular "neutral" basis, so long as the nature of the content
discrimination is such that there is no realistic possibility that official

Robson

112

The First Amendment

suppression of ideas is afoot. (We cannot think of any First Amendment interest
that would stand in the way of a State's prohibiting only those obscene motion
pictures with blue-eyed actresses.) Save for that limitation, the regulation of
"fighting words," like the regulation of noisy speech, may address some
offensive instances and leave other, equally offensive, instances alone.
II
Applying these principles to the St. Paul ordinance, we conclude that, even as
narrowly construed by the Minnesota Supreme Court, the ordinance is facially
unconstitutional. Although the phrase in the ordinance, "arouses anger, alarm
or resentment in others," has been limited by the Minnesota Supreme Court's
construction to reach only those symbols or displays that amount to "fighting
words," the remaining, unmodified terms make clear that the ordinance applies
only to "fighting words" that insult, or provoke violence, "on the basis of race,
color, creed, religion or gender." Displays containing abusive invective, no
matter how vicious or severe, are permissible unless they are addressed to one
of the specified disfavored topics. Those who wish to use "fighting words" in
connection with other ideas - to express hostility, for example, on the basis of
political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality - are not covered. The
First Amendment does not permit St. Paul to impose special prohibitions on
those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects.
In its practical operation, moreover, the ordinance goes even beyond mere
content discrimination to actual viewpoint discrimination. Displays containing
some words - odious racial epithets, for example - would be prohibited to
proponents of all views. But "fighting words" that do not themselves invoke
race, color, creed, religion, or gender - aspersions upon a person's mother, for
example - would seemingly be usable ad libitum in the placards of those
arguing in favor of racial, color, etc., tolerance and equality, but could not be
used by those speakers' opponents. One could hold up a sign saying, for
example, that all "anti-Catholic bigots" are misbegotten; but not that all
"papists" are, for that would insult and provoke violence "on the basis of
religion." St. Paul has no such authority to license one side of a debate to fight
freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis of Queensberry rules.
What we have here, it must be emphasized, is not a prohibition of fighting
words that are directed at certain persons or groups (which would be facially
valid if it met the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause); but rather, a
prohibition of fighting words that contain (as the Minnesota Supreme Court
repeatedly emphasized) messages of "bias-motivated" hatred and, in particular,
as applied to this case, messages "based on virulent notions of racial
supremacy." One must wholeheartedly agree with the Minnesota Supreme
Court that "[i]t is the responsibility, even the obligation, of diverse communities
to confront such notions in whatever form they appear," but the manner of that
confrontation cannot consist of selective limitations upon speech. St. Paul's
brief asserts that a general "fighting words" law would not meet the city's needs,
because only a content-specific measure can communicate to minority groups
that the "group hatred" aspect of such speech "is not condoned by the majority."
The point of the First Amendment is that majority preferences must be

Robson

113

The First Amendment

expressed in some fashion other than silencing speech on the basis of its
content.
Despite the fact that the Minnesota Supreme Court and St. Paul acknowledge
that the ordinance is directed at expression of group hatred, Justice Stevens
suggests that this "fundamentally misreads" the ordinance. It is directed, he
claims, not to speech of a particular content, but to particular "injur[ies]" that
are "qualitatively different" from other injuries. This is wordplay. What makes
the anger, fear, sense of dishonor, etc., produced by violation of this ordinance
distinct from the anger, fear, sense of dishonor, etc., produced by other fighting
words is nothing other than the fact that it is caused by a distinctive idea,
conveyed by a distinctive message. The First Amendment cannot be evaded that
easily. ***
Finally, St. Paul and its amici defend the conclusion of the Minnesota Supreme
Court that, even if the ordinance regulates expression based on hostility
towards its protected ideological content, this discrimination is nonetheless
justified because it is narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.
Specifically, they assert that the ordinance helps to ensure the basic human
rights of members of groups that have historically been subjected to
discrimination, including the right of such group members to live in peace
where they wish. We do not doubt that these interests are compelling, and that
the ordinance can be said to promote them. But the "danger of censorship"
presented by a facially content-based statute, requires that that weapon be
employed only where it is "necessary to serve the asserted [compelling] interest."
The existence of adequate content-neutral alternatives thus "undercut[s]
significantly" any defense of such a statute, casting considerable doubt on the
government's protestations that "the asserted justification is in fact an accurate
description of the purpose and effect of the law." The dispositive question in this
case, therefore, is whether content discrimination is reasonably necessary to
achieve St. Paul's compelling interests; it plainly is not. An ordinance not
limited to the favored topics, for example, would have precisely the same
beneficial effect. In fact, the only interest distinctively served by the content
limitation is that of displaying the city council's special hostility towards the
particular biases thus singled out. That is precisely what the First Amendment
forbids. The politicians of St. Paul are entitled to express that hostility - but not
through the means of imposing unique limitations upon speakers who (however
benightedly) disagree.
Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone's front
yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to
prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire.
The judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is
remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEVENS JOINS EXCEPT AS TO PART I-A, CONCURRING IN THE
JUDGMENT.

Robson

114

The First Amendment

I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court
should be reversed. However, our agreement ends there.
This case could easily be decided within the contours of established First
Amendment law by holding, as petitioner argues, that the St. Paul ordinance is
fatally overbroad because it criminalizes not only unprotected expression but
expression protected by the First Amendment. ***
Any contribution of this holding to First Amendment jurisprudence is surely a
negative one, since it necessarily signals that expressions of violence, such as
the message of intimidation and racial hatred conveyed by burning a cross on
someone's lawn, are of sufficient value to outweigh the social interest in order
and morality that has traditionally placed such fighting words outside the First
Amendment. Indeed, by characterizing fighting words as a form of "debate," the
majority legitimates hate speech as a form of public discussion. ***
As with its rejection of the Court's categorical analysis, the majority offers no
reasoned basis for discarding our firmly established strict scrutiny analysis at
this time. The majority appears to believe that its doctrinal revisionism is
necessary to prevent our elected lawmakers from prohibiting libel against
members of one political party, but not another, and from enacting similarly
preposterous laws. The majority is misguided.
Although the First Amendment does not apply to categories of unprotected
speech, such as fighting words, the Equal Protection Clause requires that the
regulation of unprotected speech be rationally related to a legitimate
government interest. A defamation statute that drew distinctions on the basis of
political affiliation or "an ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene works
that contain criticism of the city government," would unquestionably fail
rational-basis review. ***
I.
[A & B omitted]
C
The Court has patched up its argument with an apparently nonexhaustive list
of ad hoc exceptions, in what can be viewed either as an attempt to confine the
effects of its decision to the facts of this case, or as an effort to anticipate some
of the questions that will arise from its radical revision of First Amendment law.
For instance, if the majority were to give general application to the rule on
which it decides this case, today's decision would call into question the
constitutionality of the statute making it illegal to threaten the life of the
President. 18 U.S.C. 871. Surely, this statute, by singling out certain threats,
incorporates a content-based distinction; it indicates that the Government
especially disfavors threats against the President, as opposed to threats against
all others. But because the Government could prohibit all threats, and not just
those directed against the President, under the Court's theory, the compelling
reasons justifying the enactment of special legislation to safeguard the
President would be irrelevant, and the statute would fail First Amendment
review.
To save the statute, the majority has engrafted the following exception onto its
newly announced First Amendment rule: content-based distinctions may be

Robson

115

The First Amendment

drawn within an unprotected category of speech if the basis for the distinctions
is "the very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable." Thus,
the argument goes, the statute making it illegal to threaten the life of the
President is constitutional, since the reasons why threats of violence are outside
the First Amendment (protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the
disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened
violence will occur) have special force when applied to the person of the
President."
The exception swallows the majority's rule. Certainly, it should apply to the St.
Paul ordinance, since "the reasons why [fighting words] are outside the First
Amendment . . . have special force when applied to [groups that have
historically been subjected to discrimination]."
To avoid the result of its own analysis, the Court suggests that fighting words
are simply a mode of communication, rather than a content-based category,
and that the St. Paul ordinance has not singled out a particularly objectionable
mode of communication. Again, the majority confuses the issue. A prohibition
on fighting words is not a time, place, or manner restriction; it is a ban on a
class of speech that conveys an overriding message of personal injury and
imminent violence, a message that is at its ugliest when directed against groups
that have long been the targets of discrimination. Accordingly, the ordinance
falls within the first exception to the majority's theory.
*** As I see it, the Court's theory does not work, and will do nothing more than
confuse the law. Its selection of this case to rewrite First Amendment law is
particularly inexplicable, because the whole problem could have been avoided
by deciding this case under settled First Amendment principles.
II
Although I disagree with the Court's analysis, I do agree with its conclusion: the
St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutional. However, I would decide the case on
overbreadth grounds.
We have emphasized time and again that overbreadth doctrine is an exception
to the established principle that "a person to whom a statute may
constitutionally be applied will not be heard to challenge that statute on the
ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, in other
situations not before the Court." A defendant being prosecuted for speech or
expressive conduct may challenge the law on its face if it reaches protected
expression, even when that person's activities are not protected by the First
Amendment. This is because "the possible harm to society in permitting some
unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that
protected speech of others may be muted." ***
I agree with petitioner that the ordinance is invalid on its face. Although the
ordinance, as construed, reaches categories of speech that are constitutionally
unprotected, it also criminalizes a substantial amount of expression that however repugnant - is shielded by the First Amendment. ***
Our fighting words cases have made clear, however, that such generalized
reactions are not sufficient to strip expression of its constitutional protection.

Robson

116

The First Amendment

The mere fact that expressive activity causes hurt feelings, offense, or
resentment does not render the expression unprotected.
In the First Amendment context, “[c]riminal statutes must be scrutinized with
particular care; those that make unlawful a substantial amount of
constitutionally protected conduct may be held facially invalid even if they also
have legitimate application.” The St. Paul antibias ordinance is such a law.
Although the ordinance reaches conduct that is unprotected, it also makes
criminal expressive conduct that causes only hurt feelings, offense, or
resentment, and is protected by the First Amendment. The ordinance is
therefore fatally overbroad and invalid on its face.
III
Today, the Court has disregarded two established principles of First
Amendment law without providing a coherent replacement theory. Its decision
is an arid, doctrinaire interpretation, driven by the frequently irresistible
impulse of judges to tinker with the First Amendment. The decision is
mischievous at best, and will surely confuse the lower courts. I join the
judgment, but not the folly of the opinion.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
I regret what the Court has done in this case. The majority opinion signals one
of two possibilities: It will serve as precedent for future cases, or it will not.
Either result is disheartening.
In the first instance, by deciding that a State cannot regulate speech that
causes great harm unless it also regulates speech that does not (setting law and
logic on their heads), the Court seems to abandon the categorical approach, and
inevitably to relax the level of scrutiny applicable to content-based laws. As
Justice White points out, this weakens the traditional protections of speech. If
all expressive activity must be accorded the same protection, that protection
will be scant. The simple reality is that the Court will never provide child
pornography or cigarette advertising the level of protection customarily granted
political speech. If we are forbidden from categorizing, as the Court has done
here, we shall reduce protection across the board. It is sad that, in its effort to
reach a satisfying result in this case, the Court is willing to weaken First
Amendment protections.
In the second instance is the possibility that this case will not significantly alter
First Amendment jurisprudence but, instead, will be regarded as an aberration
- a case where the Court manipulated doctrine to strike down an ordinance
whose premise it opposed, namely, that racial threats and verbal assaults are of
greater harm than other fighting words. I fear that the Court has been
distracted from its proper mission by the temptation to decide the issue over
"politically correct speech" and "cultural diversity," neither of which is presented
here. If this is the meaning of today's opinion, it is perhaps even more
regrettable.
I see no First Amendment values that are compromised by a law that prohibits
hoodlums from driving minorities out of their homes by burning crosses on
their lawns, but I see great harm in preventing the people of Saint Paul from
Robson

117

The First Amendment

specifically punishing the race-based fighting words that so prejudice their
community.
I concur in the judgment, however, because I agree with Justice White that this
particular ordinance reaches beyond fighting words to speech protected by the
First Amendment.
JUSTICE STEVENS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE WHITE AND JUSTICE BLACKMUN JOIN AS TO
PART I, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
I.
*** I am, however, even more troubled by the second step of the Court's
analysis - namely, its conclusion that the St. Paul ordinance is an
unconstitutional content-based regulation of speech. Drawing on broadly
worded dicta, the Court establishes a near-absolute ban on content-based
regulations of expression, and holds that the First Amendment prohibits the
regulation of fighting words by subject matter. Thus, while the Court rejects the
"all-or-nothing-at-all" nature of the categorical approach, it promptly embraces
an absolutism of its own: Within a particular "proscribable" category of
expression, the Court holds, a government must either proscribe all speech or
no speech at all. This aspect of the Court's ruling fundamentally
misunderstands the role and constitutional status of content-based regulations
on speech, conflicts with the very nature of First Amendment jurisprudence,
and disrupts well-settled principles of First Amendment law. ***
Our First Amendment decisions have created a rough hierarchy in the
constitutional protection of speech. Core political speech occupies the highest,
most protected position; commercial speech and nonobscene, sexually explicit
speech are regarded as a sort of second-class expression; obscenity and fighting
words receive the least protection of all. Assuming that the Court is correct that
this last class of speech is not wholly "unprotected," it certainly does not follow
that fighting words and obscenity receive the same sort of protection afforded
core political speech. Yet, in ruling that proscribable speech cannot be
regulated based on subject matter, the Court does just that. Perversely, this
gives fighting words greater protection than is afforded commercial speech. If
Congress can prohibit false advertising directed at airline passengers without
also prohibiting false advertising directed at bus passengers, and if a city can
prohibit political advertisements in its buses, while allowing other
advertisements, it is ironic to hold that a city cannot regulate fighting words
based on "race, color, creed, religion or gender," while leaving unregulated
fighting words based on "union membership . . . or homosexuality." The Court
today turns First Amendment law on its head: Communication that was once
entirely unprotected (and that still can be wholly proscribed) is now entitled to
greater protection than commercial speech - and possibly greater protection
than core political speech. ***
II
Although I agree with much of Justice White's analysis, I do not join Part I-A of
his opinion because I have reservations about the "categorical approach" to the

Robson

118

The First Amendment

First Amendment. These concerns, which I have noted on other occasions, lead
me to find Justice White's response to the Court's analysis unsatisfying.
Admittedly, the categorical approach to the First Amendment has some appeal:
Either expression is protected or it is not - the categories create safe harbors for
governments and speakers alike. But this approach sacrifices subtlety for
clarity, and is, I am convinced, ultimately unsound. As an initial matter, the
concept of "categories" fits poorly with the complex reality of expression. Few
dividing lines in First Amendment law are straight and unwavering, and efforts
at categorization inevitably give rise only to fuzzy boundaries. Our definitions of
"obscenity," and "public forum," illustrate this all too well. The quest for
doctrinal certainty through the definition of categories and subcategories is, in
my opinion, destined to fail.
Moreover, the categorical approach does not take seriously the importance of
context. The meaning of any expression and the legitimacy of its regulation can
only be determined in context. Whether, for example, a picture or a sentence is
obscene cannot be judged in the abstract, but rather only in the context of its
setting, its use, and its audience. Similarly, although legislatures may freely
regulate most nonobscene child pornography, such pornography that is part of
"a serious work of art, a documentary on behavioral problems, or a medical or
psychiatric teaching device" may be entitled to constitutional protection; the
"question whether a specific act of communication is protected by the First
Amendment always requires some consideration of both its content and its
context." The categorical approach sweeps too broadly when it declares that all
such expression is beyond the protection of the First Amendment. ***
III
As the foregoing suggests, I disagree with both the Court's and part of Justice
White's analysis of the constitutionality of the St. Paul ordinance. Unlike the
Court, I do not believe that all content-based regulations are equally infirm and
presumptively invalid; unlike Justice White, I do not believe that fighting words
are wholly unprotected by the First Amendment. To the contrary, I believe our
decisions establish a more complex and subtle analysis, one that considers the
content and context of the regulated speech, and the nature and scope of the
restriction on speech. Applying this analysis and assuming arguendo (as the
Court does) that the St. Paul ordinance is not overbroad, I conclude that such a
selective, subject matter regulation on proscribable speech is constitutional.
Not all content-based regulations are alike; our decisions clearly recognize that
some content-based restrictions raise more constitutional questions than
others. Although the Court's analysis of content-based regulations cannot be
reduced to a simple formula, we have considered a number of factors in
determining the validity of such regulations. ***
In sum, the St. Paul ordinance (as construed by the Court) regulates expressive
activity that is wholly proscribable, and does so not on the basis of viewpoint,
but rather in recognition of the different harms caused by such activity. Taken
together, these several considerations persuade me that the St. Paul ordinance
is not an unconstitutional content-based regulation of speech. Thus, were the
ordinance not overbroad, I would vote to uphold it.

Wisconsin	  v.	  Mitchell	  
508 U.S. 476 (1993)

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE UNANIMOUS COURT.
Respondent Todd Mitchell's sentence for aggravated battery was enhanced
because he intentionally selected his victim on account of the victim's race. The
question presented in this case is whether this penalty enhancement is
prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. We hold that it is not.
On the evening of October 7, 1989, a group of young black men and boys,
including Mitchell, gathered at an apartment complex in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Several members of the group discussed a scene from the motion picture
"Mississippi Burning" in which a white man beat a young black boy who was
praying. The group moved outside and Mitchell asked them: "`Do you all feel
hyped up to move on some white people?'" Shortly thereafter, a young white boy
approached the group on the opposite side of the street where they were
standing. As the boy walked by, Mitchell said: "`You all want to fuck somebody
up? There goes a white boy; go get him.'" Mitchell counted to three and pointed
in the boy's direction. The group ran toward the boy, beat him severely, and
stole his tennis shoes. The boy was rendered unconscious and remained in a
coma for four days.
After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County, Mitchell was
convicted of aggravated battery. Wis.Stat. 939.05 and 940.19(1m) (1989-1990).
That offense ordinarily carries a maximum sentence of two years'
imprisonment. But because the jury found that Mitchell had intentionally
selected his victim because of the boy's race, the maximum sentence for
Mitchell's offense was increased to seven years under 939.645. That provision
enhances the maximum penalty for an offense whenever the defendant
"[i]ntentionally selects the person against whom the crime . . . is committed . . .
because of the race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin
or ancestry of that person. . . ." 939.645(1)(b). The Circuit Court sentenced
Mitchell to four years' imprisonment for the aggravated battery.
Mitchell unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief in the Circuit Court. Then
he appealed his conviction and sentence, challenging the constitutionality of
Wisconsin's penalty-enhancement provision on First Amendment grounds. The
Wisconsin Court of Appeals rejected Mitchell's challenge, but the Wisconsin
Supreme Court reversed. The Supreme Court held that the statute "violates the
First Amendment directly by punishing what the legislature has deemed to be
offensive thought." It rejected the State's contention "that the statute punishes
only the `conduct' of intentional selection of a victim." According to the court,
"[t]he statute punishes the "because of" aspect of the defendant's selection, the
reason the defendant selected the victim, the motive behind the selection." And
under R.A.V. v. St. Paul (1992), "the Wisconsin legislature cannot criminalize
bigoted thought with which it disagrees."

Robson

120

The First Amendment

The Supreme Court also held that the penalty-enhancement statute was
unconstitutionally overbroad. It reasoned that, in order to prove that a
defendant intentionally selected his victim because of the victim's protected
status, the State would often have to introduce evidence of the defendant's prior
speech, such as racial epithets he may have uttered before the commission of
the offense. This evidentiary use of protected speech, the court thought, would
have a "chilling effect" on those who feared the possibility of prosecution for
offenses subject to penalty enhancement. Finally, the court distinguished
antidiscrimination laws, which have long been held constitutional, on the
ground that the Wisconsin statute punishes the "subjective mental process" of
selecting a victim because of his protected status, whereas antidiscrimination
laws prohibit "objective acts of discrimination."
We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question presented and
the existence of a conflict of authority among state high courts on the
constitutionality of statutes similar to Wisconsin's penalty-enhancement
provision. We reverse.
Mitchell argues that we are bound by the Wisconsin Supreme Court's
conclusion that the statute punishes bigoted thought, and not conduct. There
is no doubt that we are bound by a state court's construction of a state statute.
*** But here the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not, strictly speaking, construe
the Wisconsin statute in the sense of defining the meaning of a particular
statutory word or phrase. Rather, it merely characterized the "practical effect" of
the statute for First Amendment purposes. This assessment does not bind us.
Once any ambiguities as to the meaning of the statute are resolved, we may
form our own judgment as to its operative effect.
The State argues that the statute does not punish bigoted thought, as the
Supreme Court of Wisconsin said, but instead punishes only conduct. While
this argument is literally correct, it does not dispose of Mitchell's First
Amendment challenge. To be sure, our cases reject the "view that an apparently
limitless variety of conduct can be labeled "speech" whenever the person
engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea." United States v.
O'Brien (1968); accord, R.A.V., Spence v. Washington. Thus, a physical assault
is not, by any stretch of the imagination, expressive conduct protected by the
First Amendment.
But the fact remains that, under the Wisconsin statute, the same criminal
conduct may be more heavily punished if the victim is selected because of his
race or other protected status than if no such motive obtained. Thus, although
the statute punishes criminal conduct, it enhances the maximum penalty for
conduct motivated by a discriminatory point of view more severely than the
same conduct engaged in for some other reason or for no reason at all. Because
the only reason for the enhancement is the defendant's discriminatory motive
for selecting his victim, Mitchell argues (and the Wisconsin Supreme Court
held) that the statute violates the First Amendment by punishing offenders'
bigoted beliefs.
Traditionally, sentencing judges have considered a wide variety of factors in
addition to evidence bearing on guilt in determining what sentence to impose on
a convicted defendant. Thus, in many States, the commission of a murder or

Robson

121

The First Amendment

other capital offense for pecuniary gain is a separate aggravating circumstance
under the capital sentencing statute.
But it is equally true that a defendant's abstract beliefs, however obnoxious to
most people, may not be taken into consideration by a sentencing judge.
Dawson v. Delaware (1992). In Dawson, the State introduced evidence at a
capital sentencing hearing that the defendant was a member of a white
supremacist prison gang. Because "the evidence proved nothing more than [the
defendant's] abstract beliefs," we held that its admission violated the
defendant's First Amendment rights. In so holding, however, we emphasized
that "the Constitution does not erect a per se barrier to the admission of
evidence concerning one's beliefs and associations at sentencing simply
because those beliefs and associations are protected by the First Amendment."
Thus, in Barclay v. Florida (1983) (plurality opinion), we allowed the sentencing
judge to take into account the defendant's racial animus towards his victim.
The evidence in that case showed that the defendant's membership in the Black
Liberation Army and desire to provoke a "race war" were related to the murder
of a white man for which he was convicted. Because "the elements of racial
hatred in [the] murder" were relevant to several aggravating factors, we held
that the trial judge permissibly took this evidence into account in sentencing
the defendant to death.
Mitchell suggests that Dawson and Barclay are inapposite because they did not
involve application of a penalty-enhancement provision. But in Barclay we held
that it was permissible for the sentencing court to consider the defendant's
racial animus in determining whether he should be sentenced to death, surely
the most severe "enhancement" of all. And the fact that the Wisconsin
Legislature has decided, as a general matter, that bias-motivated offenses
warrant greater maximum penalties across the board does not alter the result
here. For the primary responsibility for fixing criminal penalties lies with the
legislature.
Mitchell argues that the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement statute is invalid
because it punishes the defendant's discriminatory motive, or reason, for
acting. But motive plays the same role under the Wisconsin statute as it does
under federal and state antidiscrimination laws, which we have previously
upheld against constitutional challenge. Title VII, of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, for example, makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against
an employee "because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national
origin." 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1).***
Nothing in our decision last Term in R.A.V. compels a different result here. That
case involved a First Amendment challenge to a municipal ordinance
prohibiting the use of "`fighting words' that insult, or provoke violence, `on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.'" Because the ordinance only
proscribed a class of "fighting words" deemed particularly offensive by the city i.e., those "that contain . . . messages of `bias-motivated' hatred," we held that it
violated the rule against content-based discrimination. But whereas the
ordinance struck down in R.A.V. was explicitly directed at expression, the
statute in this case is aimed at conduct unprotected by the First Amendment.

Robson

122

The First Amendment

Moreover, the Wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement bias-inspired
conduct because this conduct is thought to inflict greater individual and
societal harm. For example, according to the State and its amici, bias-motivated
crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes, inflict distinct emotional
harms on their victims, and incite community unrest. See, e.g., Brief for
Petitioner 24-27; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13-15; Brief for
Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law as Amicus Curiae 18-22; Brief
for the American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 17-19; Brief for the
Anti-Defamation League et al. as Amici Curiae 910; Brief for Congressman
Charles E. Schumer et al. as Amici Curiae 8-9. The State's desire to redress
these perceived harms provides an adequate explanation for its penaltyenhancement provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders'
beliefs or biases. As Blackstone said long ago, "it is but reasonable that, among
crimes of different natures, those should be most severely punished which are
the most destructive of the public safety and happiness."
Finally, there remains to be considered Mitchell's argument that the Wisconsin
statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because of its "chilling effect" on free
speech. Mitchell argues (and the Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed) that the
statute is "overbroad" because evidence of the defendant's prior speech or
associations may be used to prove that the defendant intentionally selected his
victim on account of the victim's protected status. Consequently, the argument
goes, the statute impermissibly chills free expression with respect to such
matters by those concerned about the possibility of enhanced sentences if they
should, in the future, commit a criminal offense covered by the statute. We find
no merit in this contention.
The sort of chill envisioned here is far more attenuated and unlikely than that
contemplated in traditional "overbreadth" cases. We must conjure up a vision of
a Wisconsin citizen suppressing his unpopular bigoted opinions for fear that, if
he later commits an offense covered by the statute, these opinions will be
offered at trial to establish that he selected his victim on account of the victim's
protected status, thus qualifying him for penalty-enhancement. To stay within
the realm of rationality, we must surely put to one side minor misdemeanor
offenses covered by the statute, such as negligent operation of a motor vehicle
for it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of a situation where such offenses
would be racially motivated. We are left, then, with the prospect of a citizen
suppressing his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence of such beliefs will be
introduced against him at trial if he commits a more serious offense against
person or property. This is simply too speculative a hypothesis to support
Mitchell's overbreadth claim.
The First Amendment, moreover, does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech
to establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent. Evidence of a
defendant's previous declarations or statements is commonly admitted in
criminal trials subject to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability,
and the like. Nearly half a century ago, in Haupt v. United States (1947), we
rejected a contention similar to that advanced by Mitchell here. Haupt was tried
for the offense of treason, which, as defined by the Constitution (Art. III, 3), may
depend very much on proof of motive. To prove that the acts in question were
committed out of "adherence to the enemy" rather than "parental solicitude,"

Robson

123

The First Amendment

the Government introduced evidence of conversations that had taken place long
prior to the indictment, some of which consisted of statements showing Haupt's
sympathy with Germany and Hitler and hostility towards the United States. We
rejected Haupt's argument that this evidence was improperly admitted. While
"[s]uch testimony is to be scrutinized with care to be certain the statements are
not expressions of mere lawful and permissible difference of opinion with our
own government or quite proper appreciation of the land of birth, "we held that
"these statements . . . clearly were admissible on the question of intent and
adherence to the enemy."
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Mitchell's First Amendment rights were
not violated by the application of the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement provision
in sentencing him. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin is
therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

OPINION OF THE COURT WITH RESPECT TO PARTS I, II, AND III, AND AN OPINION WITH
RESPECT TO PARTS IV AND V, IN WHICH THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE STEVENS, AND
JUSTICE BREYER JOIN.
In this case we consider whether the Commonwealth of Virginia's statute
banning cross burning with "an intent to intimidate a person or group of
persons" violates the First Amendment. Va. Code Ann. §18.2-423 (1996). We
conclude that while a State, consistent with the First Amendment, may ban
cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate, the provision in the
Virginia statute treating any cross burning as prima facie evidence of intent to
intimidate renders the statute unconstitutional in its current form.
I
Respondents Barry Black, Richard Elliott, and Jonathan O'Mara were convicted
separately of violating Virginia's cross-burning statute, §18.2-423. That statute
provides:
"It shall be unlawful for any person or persons, with the intent of intimidating
any person or group of persons, to burn, or cause to be burned, a cross on the

Robson

124

The First Amendment

property of another, a highway or other public place. Any person who shall
violate any provision of this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.
"Any such burning of a cross shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to
intimidate a person or group of persons."

On August 22, 1998, Barry Black led a Ku Klux Klan rally in Carroll County,
Virginia. Twenty-five to thirty people attended this gathering, which occurred on
private property with the permission of the owner, who was in attendance. The
property was located on an open field just off Brushy Fork Road (State Highway
690) in Cana, Virginia.
When the sheriff of Carroll County learned that a Klan rally was occurring in
his county, he went to observe it from the side of the road. During the
approximately one hour that the sheriff was present, about 40 to 50 cars
passed the site, a "few" of which stopped to ask the sheriff what was happening
on the property. Eight to ten houses were located in the vicinity of the rally.
Rebecca Sechrist, who was related to the owner of the property where the rally
took place, "sat and watched to see wha[t] [was] going on" from the lawn of her
in-laws' house. She looked on as the Klan prepared for the gathering and
subsequently conducted the rally itself.
During the rally, Sechrist heard Klan members speak about "what they were"
and "what they believed in." The speakers "talked real bad about the blacks and
the Mexicans. One speaker told the assembled gathering that "he would love to
take a .30/.30 and just random[ly] shoot the blacks." The speakers also talked
about "President Clinton and Hillary Clinton," and about how their tax money
"goes to ... the black people." Sechrist testified that this language made her
"very ... scared."
At the conclusion of the rally, the crowd circled around a 25- to 30-foot cross.
The cross was between 300 and 350 yards away from the road. According to the
sheriff, the cross "then all of a sudden ... went up in a flame." As the cross
burned, the Klan played Amazing Grace over the loudspeakers. Sechrist stated
that the cross burning made her feel "awful" and "terrible."
When the sheriff observed the cross burning, he informed his deputy that they
needed to "find out who's responsible and explain to them that they cannot do
this in the State of Virginia." The sheriff then went down the driveway, entered
the rally, and asked "who was responsible for burning the cross." Black
responded, "I guess I am because I'm the head of the rally." The sheriff then
told Black, "[T]here's a law in the State of Virginia that you cannot burn a cross
and I'll have to place you under arrest for this."
Black was charged with burning a cross with the intent of intimidating a
person or group of persons, in violation of §18.2-423. At his trial, the jury was
instructed that "intent to intimidate means the motivation to intentionally put a
person or a group of persons in fear of bodily harm. Such fear must arise from
the willful conduct of the accused rather than from some mere temperamental
timidity of the victim." The trial court also instructed the jury that "the burning
of a cross by itself is sufficient evidence from which you may infer the required
intent." When Black objected to this last instruction on First Amendment
grounds, the prosecutor responded that the instruction was "taken straight out

Robson

125

The First Amendment

of the [Virginia] Model Instructions." The jury found Black guilty, and fined him
$2,500. The Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed Black's conviction.
On May 2, 1998, respondents Richard Elliott and Jonathan O'Mara, as well as
a third individual, attempted to burn a cross on the yard of James Jubilee.
Jubilee, an African-American, was Elliott's next-door neighbor in Virginia
Beach, Virginia. Four months prior to the incident, Jubilee and his family had
moved from California to Virginia Beach. Before the cross burning, Jubilee
spoke to Elliott's mother to inquire about shots being fired from behind the
Elliott home. Elliott's mother explained to Jubilee that her son shot firearms as
a hobby, and that he used the backyard as a firing range.
On the night of May 2, respondents drove a truck onto Jubilee's property,
planted a cross, and set it on fire. Their apparent motive was to "get back" at
Jubilee for complaining about the shooting in the backyard. Respondents were
not affiliated with the Klan. The next morning, as Jubilee was pulling his car
out of the driveway, he noticed the partially burned cross approximately 20 feet
from his house. After seeing the cross, Jubilee was "very nervous" because he
"didn't know what would be the next phase," and because "a cross burned in
your yard ... tells you that it's just the first round."
Elliott and O'Mara were charged with attempted cross burning and conspiracy
to commit cross burning. O'Mara pleaded guilty to both counts, reserving the
right to challenge the constitutionality of the cross-burning statute. The judge
sentenced O'Mara to 90 days in jail and fined him $2,500. The judge also
suspended 45 days of the sentence and $1,000 of the fine.
At Elliott's trial, the judge originally ruled that the jury would be instructed
"that the burning of a cross by itself is sufficient evidence from which you may
infer the required intent." At trial, however, the court instructed the jury that
the Commonwealth must prove that "the defendant intended to commit cross
burning," that "the defendant did a direct act toward the commission of the
cross burning," and that "the defendant had the intent of intimidating any
person or group of persons." The court did not instruct the jury on the
meaning of the word "intimidate," nor on the prima facie evidence provision of
§18.2-423. The jury found Elliott guilty of attempted cross burning and
acquitted him of conspiracy to commit cross burning. It sentenced Elliott to 90
days in jail and a $2,500 fine. The Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed the
convictions of both Elliott and O'Mara.
Each respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia, arguing that
§18.2-423 is facially unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Virginia
consolidated all three cases, and held that the statute is unconstitutional on its
face. It held that the Virginia cross-burning statute "is analytically
indistinguishable from the ordinance found unconstitutional in R. A. V. The
Virginia statute, the court held, discriminates on the basis of content since it
"selectively chooses only cross burning because of its distinctive message." The
court also held that the prima facie evidence provision renders the statute
overbroad because "[t]he enhanced probability of prosecution under the statute
chills the expression of protected speech."
Three justices dissented, concluding that the Virginia cross-burning statute
passes constitutional muster because it proscribes only conduct that

Robson

126

The First Amendment

constitutes a true threat. The justices noted that unlike the ordinance found
unconstitutional in R.A.V., the Virginia statute does not just target cross
burning "on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender." Rather, "the
Virginia statute applies to any individual who burns a cross for any reason
provided the cross is burned with the intent to intimidate." The dissenters also
disagreed with the majority's analysis of the prima facie provision because the
inference alone "is clearly insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt
that a defendant burned a cross with the intent to intimidate." The dissent
noted that the burden of proof still remains on the Commonwealth to prove
intent to intimidate. We granted certiorari.
II
Cross burning originated in the 14th century as a means for Scottish tribes to
signal each other. See M. NEWTON & J. NEWTON, THE KU KLUX KLAN: AN
ENCYCLOPEDIA 145 (1991). Sir Walter Scott used cross burnings for dramatic
effect in The Lady of the Lake, where the burning cross signified both a
summons and a call to arms. See W. SCOTT, THE LADY OF THE LAKE, CANTO THIRD.
Cross burning in this country, however, long ago became unmoored from its
Scottish ancestry. Burning a cross in the United States is inextricably
intertwined with the history of the Ku Klux Klan.
The first Ku Klux Klan began in Pulaski, Tennessee, in the spring of 1866.
Although the Ku Klux Klan started as a social club, it soon changed into
something far different. The Klan fought Reconstruction and the corresponding
drive to allow freed blacks to participate in the political process. Soon the Klan
imposed "a veritable reign of terror" throughout the South. S. KENNEDY,
SOUTHERN EXPOSURE 31 (1991) (hereinafter Kennedy). The Klan employed tactics
such as whipping, threatening to burn people at the stake, and murder. W.
Wade, THE FIERY CROSS: THE KU KLUX KLAN IN AMERICA 48-49 (1987) (hereinafter
Wade). The Klan's victims included blacks, southern whites who disagreed with
the Klan, and "carpetbagger" northern whites.
The activities of the Ku Klux Klan prompted legislative action at the national
level. In 1871, "President Grant sent a message to Congress indicating that the
Klan's reign of terror in the Southern States had rendered life and property
insecure." In response, Congress passed what is now known as the Ku Klux
Klan Act. See "An Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the Constitution of the United States, and for other Purposes," 17 Stat. 13 (now
codified at 42 U. S. C. §§1983, 1985, and 1986). President Grant used these
new powers to suppress the Klan in South Carolina, the effect of which severely
curtailed the Klan in other States as well. By the end of Reconstruction in 1877,
the first Klan no longer existed.
The genesis of the second Klan began in 1905, with the publication of Thomas
Dixon's THE CLANSMEN: AN HISTORICAL ROMANCE OF THE KU KLUX KLAN. Dixon's
book was a sympathetic portrait of the first Klan, depicting the Klan as a group
of heroes "saving" the South from blacks and the "horrors" of Reconstruction.
Although the first Klan never actually practiced cross burning, Dixon's book
depicted the Klan burning crosses to celebrate the execution of former slaves.
Cross burning thereby became associated with the first Ku Klux Klan. When D.
W. Griffith turned Dixon's book into the movie The Birth of a Nation in 1915, the

Robson

127

The First Amendment

association between cross burning and the Klan became indelible. In addition to
the cross burnings in the movie, a poster advertising the film displayed a
hooded Klansman riding a hooded horse, with his left hand holding the reins of
the horse and his right hand holding a burning cross above his head. Soon
thereafter, in November 1915, the second Klan began.
From the inception of the second Klan, cross burnings have been used to
communicate both threats of violence and messages of shared ideology. The
first initiation ceremony occurred on Stone Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia.
While a 40-foot cross burned on the mountain, the Klan members took their
oaths of loyalty. This cross burning was the second recorded instance in the
United States. The first known cross burning in the country had occurred a
little over one month before the Klan initiation, when a Georgia mob celebrated
the lynching of Leo Frank by burning a "gigantic cross" on Stone Mountain that
was "visible throughout" Atlanta.
The new Klan's ideology did not differ much from that of the first Klan. As one
Klan publication emphasized, "We avow the distinction between [the] races, ...
and we shall ever be true to the faithful maintenance of White Supremacy and
will strenuously oppose any compromise thereof in any and all things." Violence
was also an elemental part of this new Klan. By September 1921, the New York
World newspaper documented 152 acts of Klan violence, including 4 murders,
41 floggings, and 27 tar-and-featherings.
Often, the Klan used cross burnings as a tool of intimidation and a threat of
impending violence. For example, in 1939 and 1940, the Klan burned crosses in
front of synagogues and churches. After one cross burning at a synagogue, a
Klan member noted that if the cross burning did not "shut the Jews up, we'll
cut a few throats and see what happens." In Miami in 1941, the Klan burned
four crosses in front of a proposed housing project, declaring, "We are here to
keep niggers out of your town ... . When the law fails you, call on us." And in
Alabama in 1942, in "a whirlwind climax to weeks of flogging and terror," the
Klan burned crosses in front of a union hall and in front of a union leader's
home on the eve of a labor election. These cross burnings embodied threats to
people whom the Klan deemed antithetical to its goals. And these threats had
special force given the long history of Klan violence.
The Klan continued to use cross burnings to intimidate after World War II. In
one incident, an African-American "school teacher who recently moved his
family into a block formerly occupied only by whites asked the protection of city
police ... after the burning of a cross in his front yard." And after a cross
burning in Suffolk, Virginia during the late 1940's, the Virginia Governor stated
that he would "not allow any of our people of any race to be subjected to
terrorism or intimidation in any form by the Klan or any other organization."
These incidents of cross burning, among others, helped prompt Virginia to
enact its first version of the cross-burning statute in 1950.
The decision of this Court in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), along with the
civil rights movement of the 1950's and 1960's, sparked another outbreak of
Klan violence. These acts of violence included bombings, beatings, shootings,
stabbings, and mutilations. Members of the Klan burned crosses on the lawns
of those associated with the civil rights movement, assaulted the Freedom

Robson

128

The First Amendment

Riders, bombed churches, and murdered blacks as well as whites whom the
Klan viewed as sympathetic toward the civil rights movement.
Throughout the history of the Klan, cross burnings have also remained potent
symbols of shared group identity and ideology. The burning cross became a
symbol of the Klan itself and a central feature of Klan gatherings. According to
the Klan constitution (called the kloran), the "fiery cross" was the "emblem of
that sincere, unselfish devotedness of all klansmen to the sacred purpose and
principles we have espoused." And the Klan has often published its newsletters
and magazines under the name The Fiery Cross.
At Klan gatherings across the country, cross burning became the climax of the
rally or the initiation. Posters advertising an upcoming Klan rally often featured
a Klan member holding a cross. Typically, a cross burning would start with a
prayer by the "Klavern" minister, followed by the singing of Onward Christian
Soldiers. The Klan would then light the cross on fire, as the members raised
their left arm toward the burning cross and sang The Old Rugged Cross. Wade
185. Throughout the Klan's history, the Klan continued to use the burning
cross in their ritual ceremonies.
For its own members, the cross was a sign of celebration and ceremony. During
a joint Nazi-Klan rally in 1940, the proceeding concluded with the wedding of
two Klan members who "were married in full Klan regalia beneath a blazing
cross." In response to antimasking bills introduced in state legislatures after
World War II, the Klan burned crosses in protest. On March 26, 1960, the Klan
engaged in rallies and cross burnings throughout the South in an attempt to
recruit 10 million members. Later in 1960, the Klan became an issue in the
third debate between Richard Nixon and John Kennedy, with both candidates
renouncing the Klan. After this debate, the Klan reiterated its support for Nixon
by burning crosses. And cross burnings featured prominently in Klan rallies
when the Klan attempted to move toward more nonviolent tactics to stop
integration. In short, a burning cross has remained a symbol of Klan ideology
and of Klan unity.
To this day, regardless of whether the message is a political one or whether the
message is also meant to intimidate, the burning of a cross is a "symbol of
hate." And while cross burning sometimes carries no intimidating message, at
other times the intimidating message is the only message conveyed. For
example, when a cross burning is directed at a particular person not affiliated
with the Klan, the burning cross often serves as a message of intimidation,
designed to inspire in the victim a fear of bodily harm. Moreover, the history of
violence associated with the Klan shows that the possibility of injury or death is
not just hypothetical. The person who burns a cross directed at a particular
person often is making a serious threat, meant to coerce the victim to comply
with the Klan's wishes unless the victim is willing to risk the wrath of the Klan.
Indeed, as the cases of respondents Elliott and O'Mara indicate, individuals
without Klan affiliation who wish to threaten or menace another person
sometimes use cross burning because of this association between a burning
cross and violence.
In sum, while a burning cross does not inevitably convey a message of
intimidation, often the cross burner intends that the recipients of the message

fear for their lives. And when a cross burning is used to intimidate, few if any
messages are more powerful.
III
A
The First Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth
Amendment, provides that "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the
freedom of speech." The hallmark of the protection of free speech is to allow
"free trade in ideas"--even ideas that the overwhelming majority of people might
find distasteful or discomforting. Abrams v. United States (1919) (Holmes, J.,
dissenting); see also Texas v. Johnson, (1989). Thus, the First Amendment
"ordinarily" denies a State "the power to prohibit dissemination of social,
economic and political doctrine which a vast majority of its citizens believes to
be false and fraught with evil consequence." Whitney v. California (Brandeis,
J.,concurring). The First Amendment affords protection to symbolic or
expressive conduct as well as to actual speech. See, e.g., R. A. V.v. City of St.
Paul, Texas v. Johnson, United States v. O'Brien, Tinker v. Des Moines
Independent Community School Dist. (1969).
The protections afforded by the First Amendment, however, are not absolute,
and we have long recognized that the government may regulate certain
categories of expression consistent with the Constitution. See, e.g.,Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire (1942) ("There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited
classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which has never been
thought to raise any Constitutional problem"). The First Amendment permits
"restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are 'of
such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived
from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.' "
***
"True threats" encompass those statements where the speaker means to
communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful
violence to a particular individual or group of individuals. See Watts v. United
States (1969) ("political hyberbole" is not a true threat); R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul.
The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a
prohibition on true threats "protect[s] individuals from the fear of violence" and
"from the disruption that fear engenders," in addition to protecting people "from
the possibility that the threatened violence will occur." Intimidation in the
constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat, where a
speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of
placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. Respondents do not contest
that some cross burnings fit within this meaning of intimidating speech, and
rightly so. As noted in Part II, supra, the history of cross burning in this country
shows that cross burning is often intimidating, intended to create a pervasive
fear in victims that they are a target of violence.
B
The Supreme Court of Virginia ruled that in light of R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul,
even if it is constitutional to ban cross burning in a content-neutral manner,

Robson

130

The First Amendment

the Virginia cross-burning statute is unconstitutional because it discriminates
on the basis of content and viewpoint. It is true, as the Supreme Court of
Virginia held, that the burning of a cross is symbolic expression. The reason
why the Klan burns a cross at its rallies, or individuals place a burning cross
on someone else's lawn, is that the burning cross represents the message that
the speaker wishes to communicate. Individuals burn crosses as opposed to
other means of communication because cross burning carries a message in an
effective and dramatic manner.
The fact that cross burning is symbolic expression, however, does not resolve
the constitutional question. The Supreme Court of Virginia relied upon R.A.V. v.
City of St. Paul to conclude that once a statute discriminates on the basis of this
type of content, the law is unconstitutional. We disagree.
*** We did not hold in R.A.V. that the First Amendment prohibits all forms of
content-based discrimination within a proscribable area of speech. Rather, we
specifically stated that some types of content discrimination did not violate the
First Amendment:
"When the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very
reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable, no significant danger
of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists. Such a reason, having been adjudged
neutral enough to support exclusion of the entire class of speech from First
Amendment protection, is also neutral enough to form the basis of distinction
within the class."

*** Similarly, Virginia's statute does not run afoul of the First Amendment
insofar as it bans cross burning with intent to intimidate. Unlike the statute at
issue in R. A. V., the Virginia statute does not single out for opprobrium only
that speech directed toward "one of the specified disfavored topics." It does not
matter whether an individual burns a cross with intent to intimidate because of
the victim's race, gender, or religion, or because of the victim's "political
affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality." Moreover, as a factual matter
it is not true that cross burners direct their intimidating conduct solely to racial
or religious minorities. Indeed, in the case of Elliott and O'Mara, it is at least
unclear whether the respondents burned a cross due to racial animus.
The First Amendment permits Virginia to outlaw cross burnings done with the
intent to intimidate because burning a cross is a particularly virulent form of
intimidation. Instead of prohibiting all intimidating messages, Virginia may
choose to regulate this subset of intimidating messages in light of cross
burning's long and pernicious history as a signal of impending violence. Thus,
just as a State may regulate only that obscenity which is the most obscene due
to its prurient content, so too may a State choose to prohibit only those forms of
intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm. A ban on cross
burning carried out with the intent to intimidate is fully consistent with our
holding in R. A. V. and is proscribable under the First Amendment.
IV
[PLURALITY]
The Supreme Court of Virginia ruled in the alternative that Virginia's crossburning statute was unconstitutionally overbroad due to its provision stating
that "[a]ny such burning of a cross shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to
Robson

131

The First Amendment

intimidate a person or group of persons." Va. Code Ann. §18.2-423 (1996). The
Commonwealth added the prima facie provision to the statute in 1968. The
court below did not reach whether this provision is severable from the rest of
the cross-burning statute under Virginia law.
The Supreme Court of Virginia has not ruled on the meaning of the prima facie
evidence provision. It has, however, stated that "the act of burning a cross
alone, with no evidence of intent to intimidate, will nonetheless suffice for arrest
and prosecution and will insulate the Commonwealth from a motion to strike
the evidence at the end of its case-in-chief." The jury in the case of Richard
Elliott did not receive any instruction on the prima facie evidence provision, and
the provision was not an issue in the case of Jonathan O'Mara because he
pleaded guilty. The court in Barry Black's case, however, instructed the jury
that the provision means: "The burning of a cross, by itself, is sufficient
evidence from which you may infer the required intent." This jury instruction is
the same as the Model Jury Instruction in the Commonwealth of Virginia. See
Virginia Model Jury Instructions, Criminal, Instruction No. 10.250 (1998 and
Supp. 2001).
The prima facie evidence provision, as interpreted by the jury instruction,
renders the statute unconstitutional. Because this jury instruction is the Model
Jury Instruction, and because the Supreme Court of Virginia had the
opportunity to expressly disavow the jury instruction, the jury instruction's
construction of the prima facie provision "is a ruling on a question of state law
that is as binding on us as though the precise words had been written into" the
statute. As construed by the jury instruction, the prima facie provision strips
away the very reason why a State may ban cross burning with the intent to
intimidate. The prima facie evidence provision permits a jury to convict in every
cross-burning case in which defendants exercise their constitutional right not
to put on a defense. And even where a defendant like Black presents a defense,
the prima facie evidence provision makes it more likely that the jury will find an
intent to intimidate regardless of the particular facts of the case. The provision
permits the Commonwealth to arrest, prosecute, and convict a person based
solely on the fact of cross burning itself.
It is apparent that the provision as so interpreted "'would create an
unacceptable risk of the suppression of ideas.'" The act of burning a cross may
mean that a person is engaging in constitutionally proscribable intimidation.
But that same act may mean only that the person is engaged in core political
speech. The prima facie evidence provision in this statute blurs the line between
these two meanings of a burning cross. As interpreted by the jury instruction,
the provision chills constitutionally protected political speech because of the
possibility that a State will prosecute--and potentially convict--somebody
engaging only in lawful political speech at the core of what the First
Amendment is designed to protect.
As the history of cross burning indicates, a burning cross is not always
intended to intimidate. Rather, sometimes the cross burning is a statement of
ideology, a symbol of group solidarity. It is a ritual used at Klan gatherings, and
it is used to represent the Klan itself. Thus, "[b]urning a cross at a political rally
would almost certainly be protected expression." Indeed, occasionally a person
who burns a cross does not intend to express either a statement of ideology or

Robson

132

The First Amendment

intimidation. Cross burnings have appeared in movies such as Mississippi
Burning, and in plays such as the stage adaptation of Sir Walter Scott's The
Lady of the Lake.
The prima facie provision makes no effort to distinguish among these different
types of cross burnings. It does not distinguish between a cross burning done
with the purpose of creating anger or resentment and a cross burning done
with the purpose of threatening or intimidating a victim. It does not distinguish
between a cross burning at a public rally or a cross burning on a neighbor's
lawn. It does not treat the cross burning directed at an individual differently
from the cross burning directed at a group of like-minded believers. It allows a
jury to treat a cross burning on the property of another with the owner's
acquiescence in the same manner as a cross burning on the property of another
without the owner's permission. To this extent I agree with Justice Souter that
the prima facie evidence provision can "skew jury deliberations toward
conviction in cases where the evidence of intent to intimidate is relatively weak
and arguably consistent with a solely ideological reason for burning." Post
(opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part).
It may be true that a cross burning, even at a political rally, arouses a sense of
anger or hatred among the vast majority of citizens who see a burning cross.
But this sense of anger or hatred is not sufficient to ban all cross burnings.
***The prima facie evidence provision in this case ignores all of the contextual
factors that are necessary to decide whether a particular cross burning is
intended to intimidate. The First Amendment does not permit such a shortcut.
For these reasons, the prima facie evidence provision, as interpreted through
the jury instruction and as applied in Barry Black's case, is unconstitutional on
its face. We recognize that the Supreme Court of Virginia has not authoritatively
interpreted the meaning of the prima facie evidence provision. Unlike Justice
Scalia, we refuse to speculate on whether any interpretation of the prima facie
evidence provision would satisfy the First Amendment. Rather, all we hold is
that because of the interpretation of the prima facie evidence provision given by
the jury instruction, the provision makes the statute facially invalid at this
point. We also recognize the theoretical possibility that the court, on remand,
could interpret the provision in a manner different from that so far set forth in
order to avoid the constitutional objections we have described. We leave open
that possibility. We also leave open the possibility that the provision is
severable, and if so, whether Elliott and O'Mara could be retried under §18.2423.
V
With respect to Barry Black, we agree with the Supreme Court of Virginia that
his conviction cannot stand, and we affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Virginia. With respect to Elliott and O'Mara, we vacate the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Virginia, and remand the case for further proceedings.
It is so ordered.

PART.*** [OMITTED]

JUSTICE SOUTER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE KENNEDY AND JUSTICE GINSBURG JOIN,
CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART.
I agree with the majority that the Virginia statute makes a content-based
distinction within the category of punishable intimidating or threatening
expression, the very type of distinction we considered in R. A. V. v. St. Paul
(1992). I disagree that any exception should save Virginia's law from
unconstitutionality under the holding in R. A. V. or any acceptable variation of
it.
I
The ordinance struck down in R. A. V., as it had been construed by the State's
highest court, prohibited the use of symbols (including but not limited to a
burning cross) as the equivalent of generally proscribable fighting words, but
the ordinance applied only when the symbol was provocative " 'on the basis of
race, color, creed, religion or gender.' " Although the Virginia statute in issue
here contains no such express "basis of" limitation on prohibited subject
matter, the specific prohibition of cross burning with intent to intimidate selects
a symbol with particular content from the field of all proscribable expression
meant to intimidate. To be sure, that content often includes an essentially
intimidating message, that the cross burner will harm the victim, most probably
in a physical way, given the historical identification of burning crosses with
arson, beating, and lynching. But even when the symbolic act is meant to
terrify, a burning cross may carry a further, ideological message of white
Protestant supremacy. The ideological message not only accompanies many
threatening uses of the symbol, but is also expressed when a burning cross is
not used to threaten but merely to symbolize the supremacist ideology and the
solidarity of those who espouse it. As the majority points out, the burning cross
can broadcast threat and ideology together, ideology alone, or threat alone, as
was apparently the choice of respondents Elliott and O'Mara. ***
II
[omitted]
III
As I see the likely significance of the [prima facie] evidence provision, its
primary effect is to skew jury deliberations toward conviction in cases where the
evidence of intent to intimidate is relatively weak and arguably consistent with
a solely ideological reason for burning. To understand how the provision may
work, recall that the symbolic act of burning a cross, without more, is
consistent with both intent to intimidate and intent to make an ideological
statement free of any aim to threaten. One can tell the intimidating instance
from the wholly ideological one only by reference to some further circumstance.
In the real world, of course, and in real-world prosecutions, there will always be
further circumstances, and the factfinder will always learn something more

Robson

134

The First Amendment

than the isolated fact of cross burning. Sometimes those circumstances will
show an intent to intimidate, but sometimes they will be at least equivocal, as
in cases where a white supremacist group burns a cross at an initiation
ceremony or political rally visible to the public. In such a case, if the factfinder
is aware of the prima facie evidence provision, as the jury was in respondent
Black's case, the provision will have the practical effect of tilting the jury's
thinking in favor of the prosecution. What is significant is not that the provision
permits a factfinder's conclusion that the defendant acted with proscribable and
punishable intent without any further indication, because some such indication
will almost always be presented. What is significant is that the provision will
encourage a factfinder to err on the side of a finding of intent to intimidate
when the evidence of circumstances fails to point with any clarity either to the
criminal intent or to the permissible one. The effect of such a distortion is
difficult to remedy, since any guilty verdict will survive sufficiency review unless
the defendant can show that, "viewing the evidence in the light most favorable
to the prosecution, [no] rational trier of fact could have found the essential
elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt." The provision will thus tend
to draw nonthreatening ideological expression within the ambit of the
prohibition of intimidating expression, as Justice O'Connor notes (plurality
opinion).
To the extent the prima facie evidence provision skews prosecutions, then, it
skews the statute toward suppressing ideas. Thus, the appropriate way to
consider the statute's prima facie evidence term, in my view, is not as if it were
an overbroad statutory definition amenable to severance or a narrowing
construction. The question here is not the permissible scope of an arguably
overbroad statute, but the claim of a clearly content-based statute to an
exception from the general prohibition of content-based proscriptions, an
exception that is not warranted if the statute's terms show that suppression of
ideas may be afoot. Accordingly, the way to look at the prima facie evidence
provision is to consider it for any indication of what is afoot. And if we look at
the provision for this purpose, it has a very obvious significance as a
mechanism for bringing within the statute's prohibition some expression that is
doubtfully threatening though certainly distasteful.
It is difficult to conceive of an intimidation case that could be easier to prove
than one with cross burning, assuming any circumstances suggesting
intimidation are present. The provision, apparently so unnecessary to legitimate
prosecution of intimidation, is therefore quite enough to raise the question
whether Virginia's content-based statute seeks more than mere protection
against a virulent form of intimidation. It consequently bars any conclusion
that an exception to the general rule of R. A. V. is warranted on the ground
"that there is no realistic [or little realistic] possibility that official suppression
of ideas is afoot," Since no R. A. V. exception can save the statute as content
based, it can only survive if narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state
interest, a stringent test the statute cannot pass; a content-neutral statute
banning intimidation would achieve the same object without singling out
particular content.

Robson

IV
I conclude that the statute under which all three of the respondents were
prosecuted violates the First Amendment, since the statute's content-based
distinction was invalid at the time of the charged activities, regardless of
whether the prima facie evidence provision was given any effect in any
respondent's individual case. In my view, severance of the prima facie evidence
provision now could not eliminate the unconstitutionality of the whole statute
at the time of the respondents' conduct. I would therefore affirm the judgment
of the Supreme Court of Virginia vacating the respondents' convictions and
dismissing the indictments. Accordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment as to
respondent Black and dissent as to respondents Elliott and O'Mara.
JUSTICE THOMAS, DISSENTING.
In every culture, certain things acquire meaning well beyond what outsiders
can comprehend. That goes for both the sacred, see Texas v. Johnson, and the
profane. I believe that cross burning is the paradigmatic example of the latter.
I
Although I agree with the majority's conclusion that it is constitutionally
permissible to "ban ... cross burning carried out with intent to intimidate," I
believe that the majority errs in imputing an expressive component to the
activity in question. In my view, whatever expressive value cross burning has,
the legislature simply wrote it out by banning only intimidating conduct
undertaken by a particular means. A conclusion that the statute prohibiting
cross burning with intent to intimidate sweeps beyond a prohibition on certain
conduct into the zone of expression overlooks not only the words of the statute
but also reality.
A
"In holding [the ban on cross burning with intent to intimidate]
unconstitutional, the Court ignores Justice Holmes' familiar aphorism that 'a
page of history is worth a volume of logic.'" ***
To me, the majority's brief history of the Ku Klux Klan only reinforces this
common understanding of the Klan as a terrorist organization, which, in its
endeavor to intimidate, or even eliminate those its dislikes, uses the most
brutal of methods.
Such methods typically include cross burning--"a tool for the intimidation and
harassment of racial minorities, Catholics, Jews, Communists, and any other
groups hated by the Klan." For those not easily frightened, cross burning has
been followed by more extreme measures, such as beatings and murder. JUAN
WILLIAMS, EYES ON THE PRIZE: AMERICA'S CIVIL RIGHTS YEARS 1954-1965, at 39
(1965). As the Solicitor General points out, the association between acts of
intimidating cross burning and violence is well documented in recent American
history. Brief for the United States at 3-4 & n. 2. Indeed, the connection
between cross burning and violence is well ingrained, and lower courts have so
recognized. ***

Robson

The First Amendment

B
Virginia's experience has been no exception. In Virginia, though facing
widespread opposition in 1920s, the KKK developed localized strength in the
southeastern part of the State, where there were reports of scattered raids and
floggings. Although the KKK was disbanded at the national level in 1944, a
series of cross burnings in Virginia took place between 1949 and 1952.
Most of the crosses were burned on the lawns of black families, who either were
business owners or lived in predominantly white neighborhoods. At least one of
the cross burnings was accompanied by a shooting. The crosses burned near
residences were about five to six feet tall; while a "huge cross reminiscent of the
Ku Klux Klan days" burned "atop a hill" as part of the initiation ceremony of the
secret organization of the Knights of Kavaliers, was twelve feet tall. These
incidents were, in the words of the time, "terroristic [sic] . . . un-American act[s],
designed to intimidate Negroes from seeking their rights as citizens."
In February 1952, in light of this series of cross burnings and attendant reports
that the Klan, "long considered dead in Virginia, is being revitalized in
Richmond," Governor Battle announced that "Virginia 'might well consider
passing legislation' to restrict the activities of the Ku Klux Klan." As newspapers
reported at the time, the bill was "to ban the burning of crosses and other
similar evidences of terrorism." The bill was presented to the House of Delegates
by a former FBI agent and future two-term Governor, Delegate Mills E. Godwin,
Jr. "Godwin said law and order in the State were impossible if organized groups
could create fear by intimidation."
That in the early 1950s the people of Virginia viewed cross burning as creating
an intolerable atmosphere of terror is not surprising: Although the cross took
on some religious significance in the 1920's when the Klan became connected
with certain southern white clergy, by the postwar period it had reverted to its
original function "as an instrument of intimidation."
Strengthening Delegate Godwin's explanation, as well as my conclusion, that
the legislature sought to criminalize terrorizing conduct is the fact that at the
time the statute was enacted, racial segregation was not only the prevailing
practice, but also the law in Virginia. And, just two years after the enactment of
this statute, Virginia's General Assembly embarked on a campaign of "massive
resistance" in response to Brown v. Board of Education (1954).
It strains credulity to suggest that a state legislature that adopted a litany of
segregationist laws self-contradictorily intended to squelch the segregationist
message. Even for segregationists, violent and terroristic conduct, the Siamese
twin of cross burning, was intolerable. The ban on cross burning with intent to
intimidate demonstrates that even segregationists understood the difference
between intimidating and terroristic conduct and racist expression. It is simply
beyond belief that, in passing the statute now under review, the Virginia
legislature was concerned with anything but penalizing conduct it must have
viewed as particularly vicious.
Accordingly, this statute prohibits only conduct, not expression. And, just as
one cannot burn down someone's house to make a political point and then seek
refuge in the First Amendment, those who hate cannot terrorize and intimidate

Robson

137

The First Amendment

to make their point. In light of my conclusion that the statute here addresses
only conduct, there is no need to analyze it under any of our First Amendment
tests.
II
Even assuming that the statute implicates the First Amendment, in my view,
the fact that the statute permits a jury to draw an inference of intent to
intimidate from the cross burning itself presents no constitutional problems.
Therein lies my primary disagreement with the plurality.
A
But even with respect to statutes containing a mandatory irrebuttable
presumption as to intent, the Court has not shown much concern. For
instance, there is no scienter requirement for statutory rape. That is, a person
can be arrested, prosecuted, and convicted for having sex with a minor, without
the government ever producing any evidence, let alone proving beyond a
reasonable doubt, that a minor did not consent. In fact, "[f]or purposes of the
child molesting statute . . . consent is irrelevant. The legislature has determined
in such cases that children under the age of sixteen (16) cannot, as a matter of
law, consent to have sexual acts performed upon them, or consent to engage in
a sexual act with someone over the age of sixteen (16)." The legislature finds
the behavior so reprehensible that the intent is satisfied by the mere act
committed by a perpetrator. Considering the horrific effect cross burning has on
its victims, it is also reasonable to presume intent to intimidate from the act
itself.
Statutes prohibiting possession of drugs with intent to distribute operate much
the same way as statutory rape laws. Under these statutes, the intent to
distribute is effectively satisfied by possession of some threshold amount of
drugs. As with statutory rape, the presumption of intent in such statutes is
irrebuttable--not only can a person be arrested for the crime of possession with
intent to distribute (or "trafficking") without any evidence of intent beyond
quantity of drugs, but such person cannot even mount a defense to the element
of intent. However, as with statutory rape statutes, our cases do not reveal any
controversy with respect to the presumption of intent in these drug statutes.
Because the prima facie clause here is an inference, not an irrebuttable
presumption, there is all the more basis under our Due Process precedents to
sustain this statute.
B
The plurality, however, is troubled by the presumption because this is a First
Amendment case. The plurality laments the fate of an innocent cross-burner
who burns a cross, but does so without an intent to intimidate. The plurality
fears the chill on expression because, according to the plurality, the inference
permits "the Commonwealth to arrest, prosecute and convict a person based
solely on the fact of cross burning itself." First, it is, at the very least, unclear
that the inference comes into play during arrest and initiation of a prosecution,
that is, prior to the instructions stage of an actual trial. Second, as I explained
above, the inference is rebuttable and, as the jury instructions given in this

Robson

138

The First Amendment

case demonstrate, Virginia law still requires the jury to find the existence of
each element, including intent to intimidate, beyond a reasonable doubt.
Moreover, even in the First Amendment context, the Court has upheld such
regulations where conduct that initially appears culpable, ultimately results in
dismissed charges. A regulation of pornography is one such example. While
possession of child pornography is illegal, Ferber v. New York (1982), possession
of adult pornography, as long as it is not obscene, is allowed, Miller v. California
(1973). As a result, those pornographers trafficking in images of adults who
look like minors, may be not only deterred but also arrested and prosecuted for
possessing what a jury might find to be legal materials. This "chilling" effect has
not, however, been a cause for grave concern with respect to overbreadth of
such statutes among the members of this Court.
That the First Amendment gives way to other interests is not a remarkable
proposition. What is remarkable is that, under the plurality's analysis, the
determination of whether an interest is sufficiently compelling depends not on
the harm a regulation in question seeks to prevent, but on the area of society at
which it aims. For instance, in Hill v. Colorado (2000), the Court upheld a
restriction on protests near abortion clinics, explaining that the State had a
legitimate interest, which was sufficiently narrowly tailored, in protecting those
seeking services of such establishments "from unwanted advice" and "unwanted
communication." In so concluding, the Court placed heavy reliance on the
"vulnerable physical and emotional conditions" of patients. Thus, when it came
to the rights of those seeking abortions, the Court deemed restrictions on
"unwanted advice," which, notably, can be given only from a distance of at least
8 feet from a prospective patient, justified by the countervailing interest in
obtaining abortion. Yet, here, the plurality strikes down the statute because one
day an individual might wish to burn a cross, but might do so without an intent
to intimidate anyone. That cross burning subjects its targets, and, sometimes,
an unintended audience to extreme emotional distress, and is virtually never
viewed merely as "unwanted communication," but rather, as a physical threat,
is of no concern to the plurality. Henceforth, under the plurality's view, physical
safety will be valued less than the right to be free from unwanted
communications.
III
Because I would uphold the validity of this statute, I respectfully dissent.

The combination of symbolic speech and hate speech/conduct as
in Virginia v. Black occurs in some First Amendment challenges to the
anti-masking statutes Justice Thomas mentions in his dissent. The

Robson

139

The First Amendment

Second Circuit, in Church of Am. Knights of the Ku Klux Klan v. Kerik, 356
F.3d 197 (2d Cir. 2004), took an interesting approach to a challenge to
New York’s anti-masking statute. The KKK group had sought an
injunction against the statute to allow a demonstration while wearing
masks. Rejecting the First Amendment claim, the court agreed that the
KKK regalia - - - the robe, hood, and mask - - - met the threshold
requirement for expressive speech, but nevertheless separated the mask
in its analysis. In the court’s view, the mask was “redundant” and did
“not convey a message independently of the robe and hood.” Thus, the
mask did not rise to the level of symbolic speech.
Does this seem correct? In contexts other than the KKK? What
about the “Guy Fawkes” mask that was adopted by some during the
Occupy movements? Or the balaclava worn by “Pussy Riot” members
and supporters?

Note:	  “True	  Threats”	  
In Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705 (1969), the Court upheld the
constitutionality of the “threats against the President” statute, 18 U.S.C.
s 871(a), in a brief per curiam opinion. However, the Court concluded
that a “threat” under the statute “must be distinguished from what is
constitutionally protected speech.”
As the Court described it:
According to an investigator for the Army Counter Intelligence Corps who was
present, petitioner [Watts] responded: ‘They always holler at us to get an
education. And now I have already received my draft classification as 1-A and I
have got to report for my physical this Monday coming. I am not going. If they
ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.’ ‘They
are not going to make me kill my black brothers.’

Id. at 706.
The jury found that petitioner had committed a felony by knowingly and
willfully threatening the President; a divided Court of Appeals for the
D.C. Circuit affirmed.
The Court concluded:
whatever the "willfullness" requirement implies, the statute initially requires the
Government to prove a true "threat." We do not believe that the kind of political
hyperbole indulged in by petitioner fits within that statutory term.

Id. at 709.
In the years since Watts, whether statements are hyperbole or true
threats has become an issue in electronic and social media
communications.

The First Amendment

In Elonis v. United States, 575 U.S. ___ (2015), the Court considered
statements and “lyrics” in facebook postings in the context of a domestic
violence situation. Elonis was convicted and the Court granted certiorari
petition focused on the First Amendment and pointed to a split in the
circuits regarding an application of Virginia v. Black (2003) to a
conviction of threatening another person: did it require proof of the
defendant’s subjective intent to threaten or whether it is enough to show
that a “reasonable person” would regard the statement as threatening.
However, the Court's Order granting certiorari instructed:
In addition to the question presented by the petition, the parties are directed to
brief and argue the following question: "Whether, as a matter of statutory
interpretation, conviction of threatening another person under 18 U. S. C.
§875(c) requires proof of the defendant's subjective intent to threaten."

Given the Court’s instruction, not surprisingly the Court’s opinion,
authored by Chief Justice Roberts, “side-stepped” the First Amendment
issue.
It held that as a matter of statutory interpretation, the
instructions to the jury at trial that guilt could be predicated on a
"reasonable person" standard merited reversal. The Court added: “Given
our disposition, it is not necessary to consider any First Amendment
issues.”
However, many commentators believe that the constitutional contours of
true threats First Amendment doctrine will be returning to the Court in
the near future.

This next pair of cases concerns the constitutionality of specific statutes
Congress enacted to protect the military from civilian speech, not unlike
the wartime enactments considered in the previous chapter. Consider
how the opinions valorize - - - or not - - - the military, as well as whether
how the opinions construe “content” and “categories” in this context.

WHICH THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND STEWART, J. JOINED.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The petitioner, Daniel Jay Schacht, was indicted in a United States District
Court for violating 18 U.S.C. §702, which makes it a crime for any person
Robson

141

The First Amendment

"without authority [to wear] the uniform or a distinctive part thereof . . . of any
of the armed forces of the United States . . . ." He was tried and convicted by a
jury, and on February 29, 1968, he was sentenced to pay a fine of $250 and to
serve a six-month prison term, the maximum sentence allowable under 18
U.S.C. §702. There is no doubt that Schacht did wear distinctive parts of the
uniform of the United States Army and that he was not a member of the Armed
Forces. He has defended his conduct since the beginning, however, on the
ground that he was authorized to wear the uniform by an Act of Congress, 10
U.S.C. §772 (f), which provides as follows:
"When wearing by persons not on active duty authorized. . . . . .
"(f) While portraying a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, an
actor in a theatrical or motion-picture production may wear the uniform of that
armed force if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force."
(Emphasis added.)

Schacht argued in the trial court and in this Court that he wore the army
uniform as an "actor" in a "theatrical production" performed several times
between 6:30 and 8:30 a.m. on December 4, 1967, in front of the Armed Forces
Induction Center at Houston, Texas. The street skit in which Schacht wore the
army uniform as a costume was designed, in his view, to expose the evil of the
American presence in Vietnam and was part of a larger, peaceful antiwar
demonstration at the induction center that morning. The Court of Appeals'
opinion affirming the conviction summarized the facts surrounding the skit as
follows:
"The evidence indicates that the demonstration in Houston was part of a
nationally coordinated movement which was to take place contemporaneously at
several places throughout the country. The appellants and their colleagues
prepared a script to be followed at the induction center and they actually
rehearsed their roles at least once prior to the appointed day before a student
organization called the `Humanists.'
"The skit was composed of three people. There was Schacht who was dressed in
a uniform and cap. A second person was wearing `military colored' coveralls. The
third person was outfitted in typical Viet Cong apparel. The first two men carried
water pistols. One of them would yell, `Be an able American,' and then they
would shoot the Viet Cong with their pistols. The pistols expelled a red liquid
which, when it struck the victim, created the impression that he was bleeding.
Once the victim fell down the other two would walk up to him and exclaim, `My
God, this is a pregnant woman.' Without noticeable variation this skit was
reenacted several times during the morning of the demonstration."

I.
Our previous cases would seem to make it clear that 18 U.S.C. §702, making it
an offense to wear our military uniforms without authority is, standing alone, a
valid statute on its face. See, e. g., United States v. O'Brien (1968). But the
general prohibition of 18 U.S.C. §702 cannot always stand alone in view of 10
U.S.C. §772, which authorizes the wearing of military uniforms under certain
conditions and circumstances including the circumstance of an actor
portraying a member of the armed services in a "theatrical production." 10
U.S.C. §772(f). The Government's argument in this case seems to imply that

Robson

142

The First Amendment

somehow what these amateur actors did in Houston should not be treated as a
"theatrical production" within the meaning of §772(f). We are unable to follow
such a suggestion. Certainly theatrical productions need not always be
performed in buildings or even on a defined area such as a conventional stage.
Nor need they be performed by professional actors or be heavily financed or
elaborately produced. Since time immemorial, outdoor theatrical performances,
often performed by amateurs, have played an important part in the
entertainment and the education of the people of the world. Here, the record
shows without dispute the preparation and repeated presentation by amateur
actors of a short play designed to create in the audience an understanding of
and opposition to our participation in the Vietnam war. It may be that the
performances were crude and amateurish and perhaps unappealing, but the
same thing can be said about many theatrical performances. We cannot believe
that when Congress wrote out a special exception for theatrical productions it
intended to protect only a narrow and limited category of professionally
produced plays. Of course, we need not decide here all the questions
concerning what is and what is not within the scope of §772(f). We need only
find, as we emphatically do, that the street skit in which Schacht participated
was a "theatrical production" within the meaning of that section.
This brings us to petitioner's complaint that giving force and effect to the last
clause of §772(f) would impose an unconstitutional restraint on his right of free
speech. We agree. This clause on its face simply restricts §772(f)'s authorization
to those dramatic portrayals that do not "tend to discredit" the military, but,
when this restriction is read together with 18 U.S.C. §702, it becomes clear that
Congress has in effect made it a crime for an actor wearing a military uniform
to say things during his performance critical of the conduct or policies of the
Armed Forces. An actor, like everyone else in our country, enjoys a
constitutional right to freedom of speech, including the right openly to criticize
the Government during a dramatic performance. The last clause of §772(f)
denies this constitutional right to an actor who is wearing a military uniform by
making it a crime for him to say things that tend to bring the military into
discredit and disrepute. In the present case Schacht was free to participate in
any skit at the demonstration that praised the Army, but under the final clause
of §772(f) he could be convicted of a federal offense if his portrayal attacked the
Army instead of praising it. In light of our earlier finding that the skit in which
Schacht participated was a "theatrical production" within the meaning of
§772(f), it follows that his conviction can be sustained only if he can be
punished for speaking out against the role of our Army and our country in
Vietnam. Clearly punishment for this reason would be an unconstitutional
abridgment of freedom of speech. The final clause of §772(f), which leaves
Americans free to praise the war in Vietnam but can send persons like Schacht
to prison for opposing it, cannot survive in a country which has the First
Amendment. To preserve the constitutionality of §772(f) that final clause must
be stricken from the section.

CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT, IN WHICH KAGAN, J., JOINED. ALITO, J., FILED A DISSENTING
OPINION, IN WHICH SCALIA AND THOMAS, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE KENNEDY ANNOUNCED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT AND DELIVERED AN
OPINION, IN WHICH THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE GINSBURG, AND JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR
JOIN.
Lying was his habit. Xavier Alvarez, the respondent here, lied when he said that
he played hockey for the Detroit Red Wings and that he once married a starlet
from Mexico. But when he lied in announcing he held the Congressional Medal
of Honor, respondent ventured onto new ground; for that lie violates a federal
criminal statute, the Stolen Valor Act of 2005. 18 U. S. C. §704.
In 2007, respondent attended his first public meeting as a board member of the
Three Valley Water District Board. The board is a governmental entity with
headquarters in Claremont, California. He introduced himself as follows: "I'm a
retired marine of 25 years. I retired in the year 2001. Back in 1987, I was
awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I got wounded many times by the
same guy." None of this was true. For all the record shows, respondent's
statements were but a pathetic attempt to gain respect that eluded him. The
statements do not seem to have been made to secure employment or financial
benefits or admission to privileges reserved for those who had earned the
Medal.
Respondent was indicted under the Stolen Valor Act for lying about the
Congressional Medal of Honor at the meeting. The United States District Court
for the Central District of California rejected his claim that the statute is invalid
under the First Amendment. Respondent pleaded guilty to one count, reserving
the right to appeal on his First Amendment claim. The United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a decision by a divided panel, found the Act
invalid under the First Amendment and reversed the conviction. With further
opinions on the issue, and over a dissent by seven judges, rehearing en banc
was denied. This Court granted certiorari.
After certiorari was granted, and in an unrelated case, the United States Court
of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, also in a decision by a divided panel, found the
Act constitutional. United States v. Strandlof, 667 F. 3d 1146 (2012). So there is
now a conflict in the Courts of Appeals on the question of the Act's validity.
This is the second case in two Terms requiring the Court to consider speech
that can disparage, or attempt to steal, honor that belongs to those who fought
for this Nation in battle. See Snyder v. Phelps (2011) (hateful protests directed
at the funeral of a serviceman who died in Iraq). Here the statement that the
speaker held the Medal was an intended, undoubted lie.

Robson

The First Amendment

It is right and proper that Congress, over a century ago, established an award
so the Nation can hold in its highest respect and esteem those who, in the
course of carrying out the "supreme and noble duty of contributing to the
defense of the rights and honor of the nation," have acted with extraordinary
honor. And it should be uncontested that this is a legitimate Government
objective, indeed a most valued national aspiration and purpose. This does not
end the inquiry, however. Fundamental constitutional principles require that
laws enacted to honor the brave must be consistent with the precepts of the
Constitution for which they fought.
The Government contends the criminal prohibition is a proper means to further
its purpose in creating and awarding the Medal. When content-based speech
regulation is in question, however, exacting scrutiny is required. Statutes
suppressing or restricting speech must be judged by the sometimes
inconvenient principles of the First Amendment. By this measure, the statutory
provisions under which respondent was convicted must be held invalid, and his
conviction must be set aside.
I
Respondent's claim to hold the Congressional Medal of Honor was false. There
is no room to argue about interpretation or shades of meaning. On this
premise, respondent violated §704(b); and, because the lie concerned the
Congressional Medal of Honor, he was subject to an enhanced penalty under
subsection (c). Those statutory provisions are as follows:
"(b) False Claims About Receipt of Military Decorations or Medals.--Whoever
falsely represents himself or herself, verbally or in writing, to have been awarded
any decoration or medal authorized by Congress for the Armed Forces of the
United States . . . shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than six
months, or both.
"(c) Enhanced Penalty for Offenses Involving Congressional Medal of Honor.-"(1) In General.--If a decoration or medal involved in an offense under subsection
(a) or (b) is a Congressional Medal of Honor, in lieu of the punishment provided
in that subsection, the offender shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not
more than 1 year, or both."

Respondent challenges the statute as a content-based suppression of pure
speech, speech not falling within any of the few categories of expression where
content-based regulation is permissible. The Government defends the statute as
necessary to preserve the integrity and purpose of the Medal, an integrity and
purpose it contends are compromised and frustrated by the false statements
the statute prohibits. It argues that false statements "have no First Amendment
value in themselves," and thus "are protected only to the extent needed to avoid
chilling fully protected speech." Although the statute covers respondent's
speech, the Government argues that it leaves breathing room for protected
speech, for example speech which might criticize the idea of the Medal or the
importance of the military. The Government's arguments cannot suffice to save
the statute.

The First Amendment

"[A]s a general matter, the First Amendment means that government has no
power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject
matter, or its content." Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union (2002). As a
result, the Constitution "demands that content-based restrictions on speech be
presumed invalid . . . and that the Government bear the burden of showing
their constitutionality." Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union (2004).
In light of the substantial and expansive threats to free expression posed by
content-based restrictions, this Court has rejected as "startling and dangerous"
a "free-floating test for First Amendment coverage . . . [based on] an ad hoc
balancing of relative social costs and benefits." United States v. Stevens (2010).
Instead, content-based restrictions on speech have been permitted, as a general
matter, only when confined to the few " 'historic and traditional categories [of
expression] long familiar to the bar.' Among these categories are advocacy
intended, and likely, to incite imminent lawless action, see Brandenburg v. Ohio
(1969) (per curiam); obscenity, see, e.g., Miller v. California (1973); defamation,
see, e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964) (providing substantial protection
for speech about public figures); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (imposing some
limits on liability for defaming a private figure); speech integral to criminal
conduct, see, e.g., Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co. (1949); so-called "fighting
words," see Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942); child pornography, see New
York v. Ferber (1982); fraud, see Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens
Consumer Council, Inc., (1976); true threats, see Watts v. United States (1969)
(per curiam); and speech presenting some grave and imminent threat the
government has the power to prevent, see Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson (1931),
although a restriction under the last category is most difficult to sustain, see
New York Times Co. v. United States (1971) (per curiam). These categories have a
historical foundation in the Court's free speech tradition. The vast realm of free
speech and thought always protected in our tradition can still thrive, and even
be furthered, by adherence to those categories and rules.
Absent from those few categories where the law allows content-based regulation
of speech is any general exception to the First Amendment for false statements.
This comports with the common understanding that some false statements are
inevitable if there is to be an open and vigorous expression of views in public
and private conversation, expression the First Amendment seeks to guarantee.
See Sullivan v. New York Times ("Th[e] erroneous statement is inevitable in free
debate").
The Government disagrees with this proposition. It cites language from some of
this Court's precedents to support its contention that false statements have no
value and hence no First Amendment protection. These isolated statements in
some earlier decisions do not support the Government's submission that false
statements, as a general rule, are beyond constitutional protection. That
conclusion would take the quoted language far from its proper context. For
instance, the Court has stated "[f]alse statements of fact are particularly
valueless [because] they interfere with the truth-seeking function of the
marketplace of ideas," Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell (1988), and that false
statements "are not protected by the First Amendment in the same manner as
truthful statements," Brown v. Hartlage (1982). See also, e.g., Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy ("Untruthful speech, commercial or otherwise, has never been

Robson

146

The First Amendment

protected for its own sake"); Herbert v. Lando (1979) ("Spreading false
information in and of itself carries no First Amendment credentials"); Gertz,
("[T]here is no constitutional value in false statements of fact"); Garrison v.
Louisiana (1964) ("[T]he knowingly false statement and the false statement made
with reckless disregard of the truth, do not enjoy constitutional protection").
These quotations all derive from cases discussing defamation, fraud, or some
other legally cognizable harm associated with a false statement, such as an
invasion of privacy or the costs of vexatious litigation. In those decisions the
falsity of the speech at issue was not irrelevant to our analysis, but neither was
it determinative. The Court has never endorsed the categorical rule the
Government advances: that false statements receive no First Amendment
protection. Our prior decisions have not confronted a measure, like the Stolen
Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing more.
Even when considering some instances of defamation and fraud, moreover, the
Court has been careful to instruct that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the
speech outside the First Amendment. The statement must be a knowing or
reckless falsehood.
The Government thus seeks to use this principle for a new purpose. It seeks to
convert a rule that limits liability even in defamation cases where the law
permits recovery for tortious wrongs into a rule that expands liability in a
different, far greater realm of discourse and expression. That inverts the
rationale for the exception. The requirements of a knowing falsehood or reckless
disregard for the truth as the condition for recovery in certain defamation cases
exists to allow more speech, not less. A rule designed to tolerate certain speech
ought not blossom to become a rationale for a rule restricting it.
The Government then gives three examples of regulations on false speech that
courts generally have found permissible: first, the criminal prohibition of a false
statement made to a Government official, 18 U. S. C. §1001; second, laws
punishing perjury; and third, prohibitions on the false representation that one
is speaking as a Government official or on behalf of the Government, see, e.g.,
§912; §709. These restrictions, however, do not establish a principle that all
proscriptions of false statements are exempt from exacting First Amendment
scrutiny.
The federal statute prohibiting false statements to Government officials
punishes "whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,
legislative, or judicial branch of the Government . . . makes any materially false,
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation." §1001. Section 1001's
prohibition on false statements made to Government officials, in
communications concerning official matters, does not lead to the broader
proposition that false statements are unprotected when made to any person, at
any time, in any context.
The same point can be made about what the Court has confirmed is the
"unquestioned constitutionality of perjury statutes," both the federal statute,
§1623, and its state-law equivalents.
It is not simply because perjured
statements are false that they lack First Amendment protection. Perjured
testimony "is at war with justice" because it can cause a court to render a
"judgment not resting on truth. Perjury undermines the function and province

Robson

147

The First Amendment

of the law and threatens the integrity of judgments that are the basis of the
legal system. Unlike speech in other contexts, testimony under oath has the
formality and gravity necessary to remind the witness that his or her
statements will be the basis for official governmental action, action that often
affects the rights and liberties of others. Sworn testimony is quite distinct from
lies not spoken under oath and simply intended to puff up oneself.
Statutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is speaking on behalf of the
Government, or that prohibit impersonating a Government officer, also protect
the integrity of Government processes, quite apart from merely restricting false
speech. Title 18 U. S. C. §912, for example, prohibits impersonating an officer
or employee of the United States. Even if that statute may not require proving
an "actual financial or property loss" resulting from the deception, the statute is
itself confined to "maintain[ing] the general good repute and dignity of . . .
government . . . service itself." The same can be said for prohibitions on the
unauthorized use of the names of federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau
of Investigation in a manner calculated to convey that the communication is
approved, see §709, or using words such as "Federal" or "United States" in the
collection of private debts in order to convey that the communication has
official authorization. These examples, to the extent that they implicate fraud or
speech integral to criminal conduct, are inapplicable here.
As our law and tradition show, then, there are instances in which the falsity of
speech bears upon whether it is protected. Some false speech may be prohibited
even if analogous true speech could not be. This opinion does not imply that
any of these targeted prohibitions are somehow vulnerable. But it also rejects
the notion that false speech should be in a general category that is
presumptively unprotected.
Although the First Amendment stands against any "freewheeling authority to
declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment,"
Stevens, the Court has acknowledged that perhaps there exist "some categories
of speech that have been historically unprotected . . . but have not yet been
specifically identified or discussed . . . in our case law." Before exempting a
category of speech from the normal prohibition on content-based restrictions,
however, the Court must be presented with "persuasive evidence that a novel
restriction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of
proscription," Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn. (2011). The Government
has not demonstrated that false statements generally should constitute a new
category of unprotected speech on this basis.
III
The probable, and adverse, effect of the Act on freedom of expression illustrates,
in a fundamental way, the reasons for the Law's distrust of content-based
speech prohibitions.
The Act by its plain terms applies to a false statement made at any time, in any
place, to any person. It can be assumed that it would not apply to, say, a
theatrical performance. Still, the sweeping, quite unprecedented reach of the
statute puts it in conflict with the First Amendment. Here the lie was made in a
public meeting, but the statute would apply with equal force to personal,
whispered conversations within a home. The statute seeks to control and

Robson

148

The First Amendment

suppress all false statements on this one subject in almost limitless times and
settings. And it does so entirely without regard to whether the lie was made for
the purpose of material gain.
Permitting the government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense,
whether shouted from the rooftops or made in a barely audible whisper, would
endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false
statements are punishable. That governmental power has no clear limiting
principle. Our constitutional tradition stands against the idea that we need
Oceania's Ministry of Truth. See G. ORWELL, NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR (1949)
(Centennial ed. 2003). Were this law to be sustained, there could be an endless
list of subjects the National Government or the States could single out. Where
false claims are made to effect a fraud or secure moneys or other valuable
considerations, say offers of employment, it is well established that the
Government may restrict speech without affronting the First Amendment. See,
e.g., Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy (noting that fraudulent speech generally falls
outside the protections of the First Amendment). But the Stolen Valor Act is not
so limited in its reach. Were the Court to hold that the interest in truthful
discourse alone is sufficient to sustain a ban on speech, absent any evidence
that the speech was used to gain a material advantage, it would give
government a broad censorial power unprecedented in this Court's cases or in
our constitutional tradition. The mere potential for the exercise of that power
casts a chill, a chill the First Amendment cannot permit if free speech, thought,
and discourse are to remain a foundation of our freedom.
IV
The previous discussion suffices to show that the Act conflicts with free speech
principles. But even when examined within its own narrow sphere of operation,
the Act cannot survive. In assessing content-based restrictions on protected
speech, the Court has not adopted a free-wheeling approach, but rather has
applied the "most exacting scrutiny." Although the objectives the Government
seeks to further by the statute are not without significance, the Court must,
and now does, find the Act does not satisfy exacting scrutiny.
The Government is correct when it states military medals "serve the important
public function of recognizing and expressing gratitude for acts of heroism and
sacrifice in military service," and also " 'foste[r] morale, mission accomplishment
and esprit de corps' among service members." General George Washington
observed that an award for valor would "cherish a virtuous ambition in . . .
soldiers, as well as foster and encourage every species of military merit." Time
has not diminished this idea. In periods of war and peace alike public
recognition of valor and noble sacrifice by men and women in uniform
reinforces the pride and national resolve that the military relies upon to fulfill
its mission.
These interests are related to the integrity of the military honors system in
general, and the Congressional Medal of Honor in particular. Although millions
have served with brave resolve, the Medal, which is the highest military award
for valor against an enemy force, has been given just 3,476 times. Established
in 1861, the Medal is reserved for those who have distinguished themselves
"conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and

Robson

149

The First Amendment

beyond the call of duty." *** The Government's interest in protecting the
integrity of the Medal of Honor is beyond question.
But to recite the Government's compelling interests is not to end the matter.
The First Amendment requires that the Government's chosen restriction on the
speech at issue be "actually necessary" to achieve its interest. There must be a
direct causal link between the restriction imposed and the injury to be
prevented. The link between the Government's interest in protecting the
integrity of the military honors system and the Act's restriction on the false
claims of liars like respondent has not been shown. Although appearing to
concede that "an isolated misrepresentation by itself would not tarnish the
meaning of military honors," the Government asserts it is "common sense that
false representations have the tendency to dilute the value and meaning of
military awards." It must be acknowledged that when a pretender claims the
Medal to be his own, the lie might harm the Government by demeaning the high
purpose of the award, diminishing the honor it confirms, and creating the
appearance that the Medal is awarded more often than is true. Furthermore,
the lie may offend the true holders of the Medal. From one perspective it insults
their bravery and high principles when falsehood puts them in the unworthy
company of a pretender.
Yet these interests do not satisfy the Government's heavy burden when it seeks
to regulate protected speech. The Government points to no evidence to support
its claim that the public's general perception of military awards is diluted by
false claims such as those made by Alvarez. As one of the Government's amici
notes "there is nothing that charlatans such as Xavier Alvarez can do to stain
[the Medal winners'] honor." Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United
States et al. as Amici Curiae 1. This general proposition is sound, even if true
holders of the Medal might experience anger and frustration.
The lack of a causal link between the Government's stated interest and the Act
is not the only way in which the Act is not actually necessary to achieve the
Government's stated interest. The Government has not shown, and cannot
show, why counterspeech would not suffice to achieve its interest. The facts of
this case indicate that the dynamics of free speech, of counterspeech, of
refutation, can overcome the lie. Respondent lied at a public meeting. Even
before the FBI began investigating him for his false statements "Alvarez was
perceived as a phony." Once the lie was made public, he was ridiculed online,
his actions were reported in the press, and a fellow board member called for his
resignation. There is good reason to believe that a similar fate would befall other
false claimants. See Brief for Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press et
al. as Amici Curiae 30-33 (listing numerous examples of public exposure of
false claimants). Indeed, the outrage and contempt expressed for respondent's
lies can serve to reawaken and reinforce the public's respect for the Medal, its
recipients, and its high purpose. The acclaim that recipients of the
Congressional Medal of Honor receive also casts doubt on the proposition that
the public will be misled by the claims of charlatans or become cynical of those
whose heroic deeds earned them the Medal by right.
The remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true. This is the ordinary
course in a free society. The response to the unreasoned is the rational; to the
uninformed, the enlightened; to the straight-out lie, the simple truth. See

Robson

150

The First Amendment

Whitney v. California (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring) ("If there be time to
expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the
processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced
silence"). The theory of our Constitution is "that the best test of truth is the
power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,"
Abrams v. United States (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting). The First Amendment
itself ensures the right to respond to speech we do not like, and for good reason.
Freedom of speech and thought flows not from the beneficence of the state but
from the inalienable rights of the person. And suppression of speech by the
government can make exposure of falsity more difficult, not less so. Society has
the right and civic duty to engage in open, dynamic, rational discourse. These
ends are not well served when the government seeks to orchestrate public
discussion through content-based mandates.
Expressing its concern that counterspeech is insufficient, the Government
responds that because "some military records have been lost . . . some claims
[are] un-verifiable." This proves little, however; for without verifiable records,
successful criminal prosecution under the Act would be more difficult in any
event. So, in cases where public refutation will not serve the Government's
interest, the Act will not either. In addition, the Government claims that "many
[false claims] will remain unchallenged." The Government provides no support
for the contention. And in any event, in order to show that public refutation is
not an adequate alternative, the Government must demonstrate that
unchallenged claims undermine the public's perception of the military and the
integrity of its awards system. This showing has not been made.
It is a fair assumption that any true holders of the Medal who had heard of
Alvarez's false claims would have been fully vindicated by the community's
expression of outrage, showing as it did the Nation's high regard for the Medal.
The same can be said for the Government's interest. The American people do
not need the assistance of a government prosecution to express their high
regard for the special place that military heroes hold in our tradition. Only a
weak society needs government protection or intervention before it pursues its
resolve to preserve the truth. Truth needs neither handcuffs nor a badge for its
vindication.
In addition, when the Government seeks to regulate protected speech, the
restriction must be the "least restrictive means among available, effective
alternatives." There is, however, at least one less speech-restrictive means by
which the Government could likely protect the integrity of the military awards
system. A Government-created database could list Congressional Medal of
Honor winners. Were a database accessible through the Internet, it would be
easy to verify and expose false claims. It appears some private individuals have
already created databases similar to this, and at least one database of past
winners is online and fully searchable, see Congressional Medal of Honor
Society, Full Archive, http://www.cmohs.org/recipient-archive.php. The
Solicitor General responds that although Congress and the Department of
Defense investigated the feasibility of establishing a database in 2008, the
Government "concluded that such a database would be impracticable and
insufficiently comprehensive." Without more explanation, it is difficult to assess

the Government's claim, especially when at least one database of Congressional
Medal of Honor winners already exists.
The Government may have responses to some of these criticisms, but there has
been no clear showing of the necessity of the statute, the necessity required by
exacting scrutiny.
The Nation well knows that one of the costs of the First Amendment is that it
protects the speech we detest as well as the speech we embrace. Though few
might find respondent's statements anything but contemptible, his right to
make those statements is protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom
of speech and expression. The Stolen Valor Act infringes upon speech protected
by the First Amendment.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BREYER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE KAGAN JOINS, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
I agree with the plurality that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 violates the First
Amendment. But I do not rest my conclusion upon a strict categorical analysis.
Rather, I base that conclusion upon the fact that the statute works First
Amendment harm, while the Government can achieve its legitimate objectives in
less restrictive ways. ***
JUSTICE ALITO, WITH WHOM JUSTICE SCALIA AND JUSTICE THOMAS JOIN, DISSENTING.
Only the bravest of the brave are awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor,
but the Court today holds that every American has a constitutional right to
claim to have received this singular award. The Court strikes down the Stolen
Valor Act of 2005, which was enacted to stem an epidemic of false claims about
military decorations. These lies, Congress reasonably concluded, were
undermining our country's system of military honors and inflicting real harm
on actual medal recipients and their families.
Building on earlier efforts to protect the military awards system, Congress
responded to this problem by crafting a narrow statute that presents no threat
to the freedom of speech. The statute reaches only knowingly false statements
about hard facts directly within a speaker's personal knowledge. These lies have
no value in and of themselves, and proscribing them does not chill any valuable
speech.
By holding that the First Amendment nevertheless shields these lies, the Court
breaks sharply from a long line of cases recognizing that the right to free speech
does not protect false factual statements that inflict real harm and serve no
legitimate interest. I would adhere to that principle and would thus uphold the
constitutionality of this valuable law.
I
*** Congress long ago made it a federal offense for anyone to wear,
manufacture, or sell certain military decorations without authorization. See Act
of Feb. 24, 1923, ch. 110, 42 Stat. 1286 (codified as amended at 18 U. S. C.

Robson

152

The First Amendment

§704(a)). Although this Court has never opined on the constitutionality of that
particular provision, we have said that §702, which makes it a crime to wear a
United States military uniform without authorization, is "a valid statute on its
face." Schacht v. United States (1970).
Congress passed the Stolen Valor Act in response to a proliferation of false
claims concerning the receipt of military awards. For example, in a single year,
more than 600 Virginia residents falsely claimed to have won the Medal of
Honor. An investigation of the 333 people listed in the online edition of Who's
Who as having received a top military award revealed that fully a third of the
claims could not be substantiated. When the Library of Congress compiled oral
histories for its Veterans History Project, 24 of the 49 individuals who identified
themselves as Medal of Honor recipients had not actually received that award.
The same was true of 32 individuals who claimed to have been awarded the
Distinguished Service Cross and 14 who claimed to have won the Navy Cross.
Notorious cases brought to Congress' attention included the case of a judge who
falsely claimed to have been awarded two Medals of Honor and displayed
counterfeit medals in his courtroom; a television network's military consultant
who falsely claimed that he had received the Silver Star; and a former judge
advocate in the Marine Corps who lied about receiving the Bronze Star and a
Purple Heart.
As Congress recognized, the lies proscribed by the Stolen Valor Act inflict
substantial harm. In many instances, the harm is tangible in nature:
Individuals often falsely represent themselves as award recipients in order to
obtain financial or other material rewards, such as lucrative contracts and
government benefits. An investigation of false claims in a single region of the
United States, for example, revealed that 12 men had defrauded the
Department of Veterans Affairs out of more than $1.4 million in veteran's
benefits. In other cases, the harm is less tangible, but nonetheless significant.
The lies proscribed by the Stolen Valor Act tend to debase the distinctive honor
of military awards. And legitimate award recipients and their families have
expressed the harm they endure when an imposter takes credit for heroic
actions that he never performed. One Medal of Honor recipient described the
feeling as a " 'slap in the face of veterans who have paid the price and earned
their medals.' "
It is well recognized in trademark law that the proliferation of cheap imitations
of luxury goods blurs the " 'signal' given out by the purchasers of the originals."
In much the same way, the proliferation of false claims about military awards
blurs the signal given out by the actual awards by making them seem more
common than they really are, and this diluting effect harms the military by
hampering its efforts to foster morale and esprit de corps. Surely it was
reasonable for Congress to conclude that the goal of preserving the integrity of
our country's top military honors is at least as worthy as that of protecting the
prestige associated with fancy watches and designer handbags. Cf. San
Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U. S. 522,
539-541 (1987) (rejecting First Amendment challenge to law prohibiting certain
unauthorized uses of the word "Olympic" and recognizing that such uses harm
the U. S. Olympic Committee by "lessening the distinctiveness" of the term).

Robson

153

The First Amendment

Both the plurality and Justice Breyer argue that Congress could have preserved
the integrity of military honors by means other than a criminal prohibition, but
Congress had ample reason to believe that alternative approaches would not be
adequate. The chief alternative that is recommended is the compilation and
release of a comprehensive list or database of actual medal recipients. If the
public could readily access such a resource, it is argued, imposters would be
quickly and easily exposed, and the proliferation of lies about military honors
would come to an end.
This remedy, unfortunately, will not work. The Department of Defense has
explained that the most that it can do is to create a database of recipients of
certain top military honors awarded since 2001.
Because a sufficiently comprehensive database is not practicable, lies about
military awards cannot be remedied by what the plurality calls "counterspeech."
Without the requisite database, many efforts to refute false claims may be
thwarted, and some legitimate award recipients may be erroneously attacked.
In addition, a steady stream of stories in the media about the exposure of
imposters would tend to increase skepticism among members of the public
about the entire awards system. This would only exacerbate the harm that the
Stolen Valor Act is meant to prevent.
The plurality and the concurrence also suggest that Congress could protect the
system of military honors by enacting a narrower statute. The plurality
recommends a law that would apply only to lies that are intended to "secure
moneys or other valuable considerations." In a similar vein, the concurrence
comments that "a more finely tailored statute might . . . insist upon a showing
that the false statement caused specific harm." (opinion of Breyer, J.). But
much damage is caused, both to real award recipients and to the system of
military honors, by false statements that are not linked to any financial or other
tangible reward. Unless even a small financial loss--say, a dollar given to a
homeless man falsely claiming to be a decorated veteran--is more important in
the eyes of the First Amendment than the damage caused to the very integrity
of the military awards system, there is no basis for distinguishing between the
Stolen Valor Act and the alternative statutes that the plurality and concurrence
appear willing to sustain.
II
A
Time and again, this Court has recognized that as a general matter false factual
statements possess no intrinsic First Amendment value.***
Respondent and others who join him in attacking the Stolen Valor Act take a
different view. Respondent's brief features a veritable paean to lying. According
to respondent, his lie about the Medal of Honor was nothing out of the ordinary
for 21st-century Americans. "Everyone lies," he says. "We lie all the time."
"[H]uman beings are constantly forced to choose the persona we present to the
world, and our choices nearly always involve intentional omissions and
misrepresentations, if not outright deception." An academic amicus tells us that
the First Amendment protects the right to construct "self-aggrandizing
fabrications such as having been awarded a military decoration."

Robson

154

The First Amendment

This radical interpretation of the First Amendment is not supported by any
precedent of this Court. The lies covered by the Stolen Valor Act have no
intrinsic value and thus merit no First Amendment protection unless their
prohibition would chill other expression that falls within the Amendment's
scope. I now turn to that question.
B
While we have repeatedly endorsed the principle that false statements of fact do
not merit First Amendment protection for their own sake, we have recognized
that it is sometimes necessary to "exten[d] a measure of strategic protection" to
these statements in order to ensure sufficient " 'breathing space' " for protected
speech. Gertz. Thus, in order to prevent the chilling of truthful speech on
matters of public concern, we have held that liability for the defamation of a
public official or figure requires proof that defamatory statements were made
with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity. This same requirement
applies when public officials and figures seek to recover for the tort of
intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Falwell. ***
[T]here are broad areas in which any attempt by the state to penalize
purportedly false speech would present a grave and unacceptable danger of
suppressing truthful speech. Laws restricting false statements about
philosophy, religion, history, the social sciences, the arts, and other matters of
public concern would present such a threat. The point is not that there is no
such thing as truth or falsity in these areas or that the truth is always
impossible to ascertain, but rather that it is perilous to permit the state to be
the arbiter of truth.
Even where there is a wide scholarly consensus concerning a particular matter,
the truth is served by allowing that consensus to be challenged without fear of
reprisal. Today's accepted wisdom sometimes turns out to be mistaken. And in
these contexts, "[e]ven a false statement may be deemed to make a valuable
contribution to public debate, since it brings about 'the clearer perception and
livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.' " Sullivan
(quoting J. MILL, ON LIBERTY 15 (R. McCallum ed. 1947)).
Allowing the state to proscribe false statements in these areas also opens the
door for the state to use its power for political ends. Statements about history
illustrate this point. If some false statements about historical events may be
banned, how certain must it be that a statement is false before the ban may be
upheld? And who should make that calculation? While our cases prohibiting
viewpoint discrimination would fetter the state's power to some degree, see R. A.
V. v. St. Paul (1992) (explaining that the First Amendment does not permit the
government to engage in viewpoint discrimination under the guise of regulating
unprotected speech), the potential for abuse of power in these areas is simply
too great.
In stark contrast to hypothetical laws prohibiting false statements about
history, science, and similar matters, the Stolen Valor Act presents no risk at
all that valuable speech will be suppressed. The speech punished by the Act is
not only verifiably false and entirely lacking in intrinsic value, but it also fails to
serve any instrumental purpose that the First Amendment might protect.

Robson

155

The First Amendment

Tellingly, when asked at oral argument what truthful speech the Stolen Valor
Act might chill, even respondent's counsel conceded that the answer is none.
C
*** Neither of the two opinions endorsed by Justices in the majority claims that
the false statements covered by the Stolen Valor Act possess either intrinsic or
instrumental value. Instead, those opinions appear to be based on the distinct
concern that the Act suffers from overbreadth.
The Stolen Valor Act is a narrow law enacted to address an important problem,
and it presents no threat to freedom of expression. I would sustain the
constitutionality of the Act, and I therefore respectfully dissent.

Notes	  
1.
Schacht v. United States is a rare explicit viewpoint discrimination
case. The statute clearly allowed wearing the uniform in a theatrical
production if it flattered the military and not if the portray was
unflattering. Is there a way in which the Stolen Valor Act at issue in
United States v. Alvarez might be analyzed as viewpoint discrimination?
2.
In June 2013, President Obama signed the Stolen Valor Act of
2013 into law. Congress amended the law to include the type of “fraud”
provision suggested in the plurality and concurring opinions. The law
now subjects to criminal penalties whoever “with intent to obtain money,
property, or other tangible benefit, fraudulently holds oneself out to be a
recipient of a decoration or medal.” Pub.L. 113–12; 18 USC §704.
Additionally, there is now a government database listing military awards,
http://valor.defense.gov/. (There are also a number of nongovernmental
websites).
Do these developments undermine the arguments advanced in the
dissenting opinion in Alvarez?

would the first question be? What would the next questions be?

The First Amendment

I.	  

Prior	  Restraint	  	  	  

The notion of “censorship” is most akin to the doctrine of prior restraint,
which as the term implies, is when the government acts to prevent
speech before it can occur. In the context of the press, this is a prepublication injunction or criminalization rather than post-publication
damages.
The preeminent case involving prior restraint is New York Times v. United
States (1971), often known as The Pentagon Papers Case. The earlier
case of Near v. Minnesota (1931) is a landmark case setting out the
principles.

Near	  v.	  Minnesota	  	  
283 U.S. 697 (1931)

CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, JOINED BY HOLMES, BRANDEIS,
STONE, AND ROBERTS, J.J. JUSTICE BUTLER ISSUED A DISSENTING OPINION JOINED BY VAN
DEVANTER, MCREYNOLDS, AND SUTHERLAND, J.J.

CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Chapter 285 of the Session Laws of Minnesota for the year 1925 provides for
the abatement, as a public nuisance, of a 'malicious, scandalous and
defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical.' Section 1 of the act is as
follows:
'Section 1. Any person who, as an individual, or as a member or employee of a
firm, or association or organization, or as an officer, director, member or
employee of a corporation, shall be engaged in the business of regularly or
customarily producing, publishing or circulating, having in possession, selling
or giving away.
'(a) an obscene, lewd and lascivious newspaper, magazine, or other periodical, or
'(b) a malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper, magazine or other
periodical,
-is guilty of a nuisance, and all persons guilty of such nuisance may be enjoined,
as hereinafter provided.

Section 2 provides that, whenever any such nuisance is committed or exists,
the county attorney *** the Attorney General, or, upon like failure or refusal of
the latter, any citizen of the county, may maintain an action in the district court
of the county in the name of the state to enjoin perpetually the persons
committing or maintaining any such nuisance from further committing or
maintaining it. ***
[In this case] the county attorney of Hennepin county brought this action to
enjoin the publication of what was described as a 'malicious, scandalous and
defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical,' known as “The Saturday
Press” published by the defendants in the city of Minneapolis. *** Without

Robson

158

The First Amendment

attempting to summarize the contents of the voluminous exhibits attached to
the complaint, we deem it sufficient to say that the articles charged, in
substance, that a Jewish gangster was in control of gambling, bootlegging, and
racketeering in Minneapolis, and that law enforcing officers and agencies were
not energetically performing their duties. Most of the charges were directed
against the chief of police; he was charged with gross neglect of duty, illicit
relations with gangsters, and with participation in graft. The county attorney
was charged with knowing the existing conditions and with failure to take
adequate measures to remedy them. The mayor was accused of inefficiency and
dereliction. One member of the grand jury was stated to be in sympathy with
the gangsters. A special grand jury and a special prosecutor were demanded to
deal with the situation in general, and, in particular, to investigate an attempt
to assassinate one Guilford, one of the original defendants, who, it appears from
the articles, was shot by gangsters after the first issue of the periodical had
been published. There is no question but that the articles made serious
accusations against the public officers named and others in connection with the
prevalence of crimes and the failure to expose and punish them.
[A state district court found against the defendant, Jay Near, the publisher of
“The Saturday Press”] and found that the defendants through these
publications “did engage in the business of regularly and customarily producing,
publishing and circulating a malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper,”
and that “the said publication” “under said name of The Saturday Press, or any
other name, constitutes a public nuisance under the laws of the State.”
Judgment was thereupon entered adjudging that “the newspaper, magazine and
periodical known as The Saturday Press,” as a public nuisance, “be and is
hereby abated.” The judgment perpetually enjoined the defendants “from
producing, editing, publishing, circulating, having in their possession, selling or
giving away any publication whatsoever which is a malicious, scandalous or
defamatory newspaper, as defined by law,” and also “from further conducting
said nuisance under the name and title of said The Saturday Press or any other
name or title.” *** [Near appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court which
affirmed].
This statute, for the suppression as a public nuisance of a newspaper or
periodical, is unusual, if not unique, and raises questions of grave importance
transcending the local interests involved in the particular action. It is no longer
open to doubt that the liberty of the press and of speech is within the liberty
safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from
invasion by state action. *** Liberty, in each of its phases, has its history and
connotation, and, in the present instance, the inquiry is as to the historic
conception of the liberty of the press and whether the statute under review
violates the essential attributes of that liberty.
*** It is thus important to note precisely the purpose and effect of the statute as
the state court has construed it.
First. The statute is not aimed at the redress of individual or private wrongs.
Remedies for libel remain available and unaffected. ***
Second. The statute is directed not simply at the circulation of scandalous and
defamatory statements with regard to private citizens, but at the continued

Robson

159

The First Amendment

publication by newspapers and periodical of charges against public officers of
corruption, malfeasance in office, or serious neglect of duty.***
Third. The object of the statute is not punishment, in the ordinary sense, but
suppression of the offending newspaper or periodical.***
Fourth. The statute not only operates to suppress the offending newspaper or
periodical, but to put the publisher under an effective censorship. When a
newspaper or periodical is found to be “malicious, scandalous and defamatory,”
and is suppressed as such, resumption of publication is punishable as a
contempt of court by fine or imprisonment. ***
If we cut through mere details of procedure, the operation and effect of the
statute in substance is that public authorities may bring the owner or publisher
of a newspaper or periodical before a judge upon a charge of conducting a
business of publishing scandalous and defamatory matter- - - in particular that
the matter consists of charges against public officers of official dereliction- - and, unless the owner or publisher is able and disposed to bring competent
evidence to satisfy the judge that the charges are true and are published with
good motives and for justifiable ends, his newspaper or periodical is suppressed
and further publication is made punishable as a contempt. This is of the
essence of censorship.
The question is whether a statute authorizing such proceedings in restraint of
publication is consistent with the conception of the liberty of the press as
historically conceived and guaranteed. In determining the extent of the
constitutional protection, it has been generally, if not universally, considered
that it is the chief purpose of the guaranty to prevent previous restraints upon
publication. The struggle in England, directed against the legislative power of
the licenser, resulted in renunciation of the censorship of the press. The liberty
deemed to be established was thus described by Blackstone: 'The liberty of the
press is indeed essential to the nature of a free state; but this consists in laying
no previous restraints upon publications, and not in freedom from censure for
criminal matter when published. Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay
what sentiments he pleases before the public; to forbid this, is to destroy the
freedom of the press; but if he publishes what is improper, mischievous or
illegal, he must take the consequence of his own temerity.' 4 Bl. Com. 151, 152.
See Story on the Constitution, 1884, 1889. The distinction was early pointed
out between the extent of the freedom with respect to censorship under our
constitutional system and that enjoyed in England. Here, as Madison said, 'the
great and essential rights of the people are secured against legislative as well as
against executive ambition. They are secured, not by laws paramount to
prerogative, but by constitutions paramount to laws. This security of the
freedom of the press requires that it should be exempt not only from previous
restraint by the Executive, as in Great Britain, but from legislative restraint
also.' REPORT ON THE VIRGINIA RESOLUTIONS, MADISON'S WORKS, vol. IV, p. 543.
This Court said, in Patterson v. Colorado (1907) : 'In the first place, the main
purpose of such constitutional provisions is 'to prevent all such previous
restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments,' and
they do not prevent the subsequent punishment of such as may be deemed
contrary to the public welfare. The preliminary freedom extends as well to the
false as to the true; the subsequent punishment may extend as well to the true

Robson

160

The First Amendment

as to the false. This was the law of criminal libel apart from statute in most
cases, if not in all.
*** The objection has also been made that the principle as to immunity from
previous restraint is stated too broadly, if every such restraint is deemed to be
prohibited. That is undoubtedly true; the protection even as to previous
restraint is not absolutely unlimited. But the limitation has been recognized
only in exceptional cases. “When a nation is at war many things that might be
said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will
not be endured so long as men fight and that no Court could regard them as
protected by any constitutional right.” Schenck v. United States (1919). No one
would question but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its
recruiting service or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the
number and location of troops. On similar grounds, the primary requirements
of decency may be enforced against obscene publications. The security of the
community life may be protected against incitements to acts of violence and the
overthrow by force of orderly government. The constitutional guaranty of free
speech does not “protect a man from an injunction against uttering words that
may have all the effect of force.” These limitations are not applicable here. ***
The exceptional nature of its limitations places in a strong light the general
conception that liberty of the press, historically considered and taken up by the
Federal Constitution, has meant, principally although not exclusively, immunity
from previous restraints or censorship. The conception of the liberty of the
press in this country had broadened with the exigencies of the colonial period
and with the efforts to secure freedom from oppressive administration. That
liberty was especially cherished for the immunity it afforded from previous
restraint of the publication of censure of public officers and charges of official
misconduct. *** Madison, who was the leading spirit in the preparation of the
First Amendment of the Federal Constitution, thus described the practice and
sentiment which led to the guaranties of liberty of the press in State
Constitutions:
“In every State, probable, in the Union, the press has exerted a freedom
in canvassing the merits and measures of public men of every
description which has not been confined to the strict limits of the
common law. On this footing the freedom of the press has stood; on this
footing it yet stands. ... Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the
proper use of everything, and in no instance is this more true than in
that of the press. It has accordingly been decided by the practice of the
States, that it is better to leave a few of its noxious branches to their
luxuriant growth, than, by pruning them away, to injure the vigour of
those yielding the proper fruits. And can the wisdom of this policy be
doubted by any who reflect that to the press alone, chequered as it is
with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been
gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression; who reflect
that to the same beneficent source the United States owe much of the
lights which conducted them to the ranks of a free and independent
nation, and which have improved their political system into a shape so
auspicious to their happiness? Had ‘Sedition Acts,’ forbidding every
publication that might bring the constituted agents into contempt or

161

The First Amendment

disrepute, or that might excite the hatred of the people against the
authors of unjust or pernicious measures, been uniformly enforced
against the press, might not the United States have been languishing at
this day under the infirmities of a sickly Confederation? Might they not,
possibly, be miserable colonies, groaning under a foreign yoke?”
The fact that for approximately one hundred and fifty years there has been
almost an entire absence of attempts to impose previous restraints upon
publications relating to the malfeasance of public officers is significant of the
deep-seated conviction that such restraints would violate constitutional right.
*** The general principle that the constitutional guaranty of the liberty of the
press gives immunity from previous restraints has been approved in many
decisions under the provisions of state constitutions.
The statute in question cannot be justified by reason of the fact that the
publisher is permitted to show, before injunction issues, that the matter
published is true and is published with good motives and for justifiable ends. If
such a statute, authorizing suppression and injunction on such a basis, is
constitutionally valid, it would be equally permissible for the Legislature to
provide that at any time the publisher of any newspaper could be brought
before a court, or even an administrative officer (as the constitutional protection
may not be regarded as resting on mere procedural details), and required to
produce proof of the truth of his publication, or of what he intended to publish
and of his motives, or stand enjoined. If this can be done, the Legislature may
provide machinery for determining in the complete exercise of its discretion
what are justifiable ends and restrain publication accordingly. And it would be
but a step to a complete system of censorship. ***
*** For these reasons we hold the statute, so far as it authorized the
proceedings in this action under clause (b)of section 1, to be an infringement of
the liberty of the press guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. We should
add that this decision rests upon the operation and effect of the statute,
without regard to the question of the truth of the charges contained in the
particular periodical. The fact that the public officers named in this case, and
those associated with the charges of official dereliction, may be deemed to be
impeccable, cannot affect the conclusion that the statute imposes an
unconstitutional restraint upon publication.
Judgment reversed.

New	  York	  Times	  Co.	  v.	  United	  States	  	  
403 U.S. 713 (1971)

PER CURIAM
We granted certiorari in these cases in which the United States seeks to enjoin
the New York Times and the Washington Post from publishing the contents of a
classified study entitled “History of U.S. Decision-Making Process on Viet Nam
Policy.” [“The Pentagon Papers”]
“Any system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a
heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.” The Government “thus
carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition of such a
restraint.” The District Court for the Southern District of New York in the New
York Times case and the District Court for the District of Columbia and the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the Washington Post
case held that the Government had not met that burden. We agree.
*** The stays entered June 25, 1971, by the Court are vacated. The judgments
shall issue forthwith.

 MR. JUSTICE BLACK, WITH WHOM MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS JOINS, CONCURRING.
I adhere to the view that the Government's case against the Washington Post
should have been dismissed and that the injunction against the New York
Times should have been vacated without oral argument when the cases were
first presented to this Court. I believe that every moment's continuance of the
injunctions against these newspapers amounts to a flagrant, indefensible, and
continuing violation of the First Amendment. *** In my view it is unfortunate
that some of my Brethren are apparently willing to hold that the publication of
news may sometimes be enjoined. Such a holding would make a shambles of
the First Amendment.
Our Government was launched in 1789 with the adoption of the Constitution.
The Bill of Rights, including the First Amendment, followed in 1791. Now, for
the first time in the 182 years since the founding of the Republic, the federal
courts are asked to hold that the First Amendment does not mean what it says,
but rather means that the Government can halt the publication of current news
of vital importance to the people of this country.
In seeking injunctions against these newspapers and in its presentation to the
Court, the Executive Branch seems to have forgotten the essential purpose and
history of the First Amendment.***
In other words, we are asked to hold that despite the First Amendment's
emphatic command, the Executive Branch, the Congress, and the Judiciary can
make laws enjoining publication of current news and abridging freedom of the
press in the name of “national security.” The Government does not even attempt
to rely on any act of Congress. Instead it makes the bold and dangerously farreaching contention that the courts should take it upon themselves to “make” a
law abridging freedom of the press in the name of equity, presidential power
and national security, even when the representatives of the people in Congress

Robson

163

The First Amendment

have adhered to the command of the First Amendment and refused to make
such a law.***
The word “security” is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be
invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment.
The guarding of military and diplomatic secrets at the expense of informed
representative government provides no real security for our Republic. The
Framers of the First Amendment, fully aware of both the need to defend a new
nation and the abuses of the English and Colonial governments, sought to give
this new society strength and security by providing that freedom of speech,
press, religion, and assembly should not be abridged.

 
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, WITH WHOM MR. JUSTICE BLACK JOINS, CONCURRING.
*** The dominant purpose of the First Amendment was to prohibit the
widespread practice of governmental suppression of embarrassing information.
It is common knowledge that the First Amendment was adopted against the
widespread use of the common law of seditious libel to punish the
dissemination of material that is embarrassing to the powers-that-be. The
present cases will, I think, go down in history as the most dramatic illustration
of that principle. A debate of large proportions goes on in the Nation over our
posture in Vietnam. That debate antedated the disclosure of the contents of the
present documents. The latter are highly relevant to the debate in progress.
Secrecy in government is fundamentally anti-democratic, perpetuating
bureaucratic errors. Open debate and discussion of public issues are vital to
our national health. On public questions there should be "uninhibited, robust,
and wide-open" debate. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964).
The stays in these cases that have been in effect for more than a week
constitute a flouting of the principles of the First Amendment as interpreted in
Near v. Minnesota (1931).

 
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, CONCURRING.
*** The error that has pervaded these cases from the outset was the granting of
any injunctive relief whatsoever, interim or otherwise. The entire thrust of the
Government's claim throughout these cases has been that publication of the
material sought to be enjoined "could," or "might," or "may" prejudice the
national interest in various ways. But the First Amendment tolerates absolutely
no prior judicial restraints of the press predicated upon surmise or conjecture
that untoward consequences may result. Our cases, it is true, have indicated
that there is a single, extremely narrow class of cases in which the First
Amendment's ban on prior judicial restraint may be overridden. Our cases have
thus far indicated that such cases may arise only when the Nation "is at war,"
Schenck v. United States (1919), during which times "[n]o one would question
but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting service
or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location
of troops." Near v. Minnesota (1931). Even if the present world situation were
assumed to be tantamount to a time of war, or if the power of presently

Robson

164

The First Amendment

available armaments would justify even in peacetime the suppression of
information that would set in motion a nuclear holocaust, in neither of these
actions has the Government presented or even alleged that publication of items
from or based upon the material at issue would cause the happening of an
event of that nature. "[T]he chief purpose of [the First Amendment's] guaranty
[is] to prevent previous restraints upon publication." Near v. Minnesota. Thus,
only governmental allegation and proof that publication must inevitably,
directly, and immediately cause the occurrence of an event kindred to
imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can support even the
issuance of an interim restraining order. In no event may mere conclusions be
sufficient: for if the Executive Branch seeks judicial aid in preventing
publication, it must inevitably submit the basis upon which that aid is sought
to scrutiny by the judiciary. And therefore, every restraint issued in this case,
whatever its form, has violated the First Amendment - and not less so because
that restraint was justified as necessary to afford the courts an opportunity to
examine the claim more thoroughly. Unless and until the Government has
clearly made out its case, the First Amendment commands that no injunction
may issue.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, WITH WHOM MR. JUSTICE STEWART JOINS, CONCURRING.
I concur in today's judgments, but only because of the concededly extraordinary
protection against prior restraints enjoyed by the press under our constitutional
system. I do not say that in no circumstances would the First Amendment
permit an injunction against publishing information about government plans or
operations. Nor, after examining the materials the Government characterizes as
the most sensitive and destructive, can I deny that revelation of these
documents will do substantial damage to public interests. Indeed, I am
confident that their disclosure will have that result. But I nevertheless agree
that the United States has not satisfied the very heavy burden that it must meet
to warrant an injunction against publication in these cases, at least in the
absence of express and appropriately limited congressional authorization for
prior restraints in circumstances such as these.
The Government's position is simply stated: The responsibility of the Executive
for the conduct of the foreign affairs and for the security of the Nation is so
basic that the President is entitled to an injunction against publication of a
newspaper story whenever he can convince a court that the information to be
revealed threatens "grave and irreparable" injury to the public interest; and the
injunction should issue whether or not the material to be published is classified,
whether or not publication would be lawful under relevant criminal statutes
enacted by Congress, and regardless of the circumstances by which the
newspaper came into possession of the information.
[The remainder of Justice White’s concurring opinion, like the concurring
opinion of Justice Stewart, joined by Justice White, and the concurring opinion
of Justice Marshall discuss the separation of powers issues rather than the
First Amendment issues.]

The First Amendment

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, DISSENTING.
So clear are the constitutional limitations on prior restraint against expression,
that from the time of Near v. Minnesota (1931) *** we have had little occasion to
be concerned with cases involving prior restraints against news reporting on
matters of public interest. There is, therefore, little variation among the
members of the Court in terms of resistance to prior restraints against
publication. Adherence to this basic constitutional principle, however, does not
make these cases simple. In these cases, the imperative of a free and unfettered
press comes into collision with another imperative, the effective functioning of a
complex modern government and specifically the effective exercise of certain
constitutional powers of the Executive. Only those who view the First
Amendment as an absolute in all circumstances - a view I respect, but reject can find such cases as these to be simple or easy.
These cases are not simple for another and more immediate reason. We do not
know the facts of the cases. No District Judge knew all the facts. No Court of
Appeals judge knew all the facts. No member of this Court knows all the facts.
*** It is not disputed that the Times has had unauthorized possession of the
documents for three to four months, during which it has had its expert analysts
studying them, presumably digesting them and preparing the material for
publication. During all of this time, the Times, presumably in its capacity as
trustee of the public's "right to know," has held up publication for purposes it
considered proper and thus public knowledge was delayed. No doubt this was
for a good reason; the analysis of 7,000 pages of complex material drawn from a
vastly greater volume of material would inevitably take time and the writing of
good news stories takes time. But why should the United States Government,
from whom this information was illegally acquired by someone, along with all
the counsel, trial judges, and appellate judges be placed under needless
pressure? After these months of deferral, the alleged "right to know" has
somehow and suddenly become a right that must be vindicated instanter.
[The dissenting opinions of Justice Harlan and of Justice Blackmun are
omitted.]

Notes	  
1.
In their respective dissenting opinions in New York Times v. United
States, both Justice Harlan (joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice
Blackmun) and Justice Blackmun quote a passage from Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes:
Great cases like hard cases make bad law. For great cases are called great, not
by reason of their real importance in shaping the law of the future, but because
of some accident of immediate overwhelming interest which appeals to the
feelings and distorts the judgment. These immediate interests exercise a kind of
hydraulic pressure which makes what previously was clear seem doubtful, and
before which even well settled principles of law will bend.

Robson

166

The First Amendment

Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, 400-401 (1904).
Holmes was dissenting in a closely divided case that did not involve the
First Amendment but a monopoly.
Is New York Times v. United States still a “great” case, as even the
dissenters seemed to think? Has the “immediate interest” of the case
faded?
Is its status as a high-water mark of First Amendment
recognition for the press an “accident”?
2.
Reconsider the role of Justice Holmes, previously discussed in a
note in light of the fact that Justice Holmes proved popular with the
dissenting Justices in New York Times v. United States. In addition to the
“great cases” make “bad law” quote above, two dissenting opinions
specifically invoked Justice Holmes’ writing in Schenck v. United States
(1919). (While Justice Brennan also quotes Schenck, he does not use
Holmes’ name).
Justice Blackmun’s individual dissenting opinion states that “Mr. Justice
Holmes gave us a suggestion” of “situations where restraint is in order
and is constitutional” by writing in Schenck:
When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are
such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as
men fight and that no Court could regard them as protected by any
constitutional right.

Chief Justice Burger’s dissenting opinion invoked Holmes and alluded to
Schenck without specific citation:
Of course, the First Amendment right itself is not an absolute, as Justice
Holmes so long ago pointed out in his aphorism concerning the right to shout
“fire” in a crowded theater if there was no fire.

Would the Holmes of Abrams v. United States (1919) have agreed with the
dissenters?
3.
The doctrine of “prior restraint” is not limited to the press, but
appears in speech cases as well. The doctrine of prior restraint when it
involves the press need not involve the government (as in New York
Times) or government officials (as in Near); the next section includes
“prior restraint” cases as well as “punishment” (damages) cases.
Consider whether prior restraint is always more of an infringement than
punishment.

JUSTICE CLARK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT [JUSTICE BLACK DISSENTED
WITHOUT OPINION].
This federal habeas corpus application involves the question whether Sheppard
was deprived of a fair trial in his state conviction for the second-degree murder
of his wife because of the trial judge's failure to protect Sheppard sufficiently
from the massive, pervasive and prejudicial publicity that attended his
prosecution. The United States District Court held that he was not afforded a
fair trial *** The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed by a divided vote.
We granted certiorari. We have concluded that Sheppard did not receive a fair
trial consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and,
therefore, reverse the judgment.
I.
Marilyn Sheppard, petitioner's pregnant wife, was bludgeoned to death in the
upstairs bedroom of their lakeshore home in Bay Village, Ohio, a suburb of
Cleveland. *** [on July 4, 1954].
From the outset officials focused suspicion on [Dr. Sam] Sheppard. After a
search of the house and premises on the morning of the tragedy, Dr. Gerber,
the Coroner, is reported - and it is undenied - to have told his men, "Well, it is
evident the doctor did this, so let's go get the confession out of him." ***Until
the Coroner's inquest on July 22, at which time he was subpoenaed, Sheppard
made himself available for frequent and extended questioning without the
presence of an attorney.
On July 7, the day of Marilyn Sheppard's funeral, a newspaper story appeared
in which Assistant County Attorney Mahon - later the chief prosecutor of
Sheppard - sharply criticized the refusal of the Sheppard family to permit his
immediate questioning. From there on headline stories repeatedly stressed

Robson

168

The First Amendment

Sheppard's lack of cooperation with the police and other officials. Under the
headline "Testify Now In Death, Bay Doctor Is Ordered," one story described a
visit by Coroner Gerber and four police officers to the hospital on July 8. When
Sheppard insisted that his lawyer be present, the Coroner wrote out a subpoena
and served it on him. Sheppard then agreed to submit to questioning without
counsel and the subpoena was torn up. The officers questioned him for several
hours. On July 9, Sheppard, at the request of the Coroner, re-enacted the
tragedy at his home before the Coroner, police officers, and a group of newsmen,
who apparently were invited by the Coroner. The home was locked so that
Sheppard was obliged to wait outside until the Coroner arrived. Sheppard's
performance was reported in detail by the news media along with photographs.
The newspapers also played up Sheppard's refusal to take a lie detector test
and "the protective ring" thrown up by his family. Front-page newspaper
headlines announced on the same day that "Doctor Balks At Lie Test; Retells
Story." A column opposite that story contained an "exclusive" interview with
Sheppard headlined: "`Loved My Wife, She Loved Me,' Sheppard Tells News
Reporter." The next day, another headline story disclosed that Sheppard had
"again late yesterday refused to take a lie detector test" and quoted an Assistant
County Attorney as saying that "at the end of a nine-hour questioning of Dr.
Sheppard, I felt he was now ruling [a test] out completely." But subsequent
newspaper articles reported that the Coroner was still pushing Sheppard for a
lie detector test. More stories appeared when Sheppard would not allow
authorities to inject him with "truth serum."
On the 20th, the "editorial artillery" opened fire with a front-page charge that
somebody is "getting away with murder." The editorial attributed the ineptness
of the investigation to "friendships, relationships, hired lawyers, a husband who
ought to have been subjected instantly to the same third-degree to which any
other person under similar circumstances is subjected . . . ." The following day,
July 21, another page-one editorial was headed: "Why No Inquest? Do It Now,
Dr. Gerber." The Coroner called an inquest the same day and subpoenaed
Sheppard. It was staged the next day in a school gymnasium; the Coroner
presided with the County Prosecutor as his advisor and two detectives as
bailiffs. In the front of the room was a long table occupied by reporters,
television and radio personnel, and broadcasting equipment. The hearing was
broadcast with live microphones placed at the Coroner's seat and the witness
stand. A swarm of reporters and photographers attended. Sheppard was
brought into the room by police who searched him in full view of several
hundred spectators. Sheppard's counsel were present during the three-day
inquest but were not permitted to participate. When Sheppard's chief counsel
attempted to place some documents in the record, he was forcibly ejected from
the room by the Coroner, who received cheers, hugs, and kisses from ladies in
the audience. Sheppard was questioned for five and one-half hours about his
actions on the night of the murder, his married life, and a love affair with Susan
Hayes. At the end of the hearing the Coroner announced that he "could" order
Sheppard held for the grand jury, but did not do so.
Throughout this period the newspapers
incriminate Sheppard and pointed out
authorities. At the same time, Sheppard
press and wrote feature articles asserting

emphasized evidence that tended to
discrepancies in his statements to
made many public statements to the
his innocence. During the inquest on

169

The First Amendment

Robson

July 26, a headline in large type stated: "Kerr [Captain of the Cleveland Police]
Urges Sheppard's Arrest." In the story, Detective McArthur "disclosed that
scientific tests at the Sheppard home have definitely established that the killer
washed off a trail of blood from the murder bedroom to the downstairs section,"
a circumstance casting doubt on Sheppard's accounts of the murder. No such
evidence was produced at trial. The newspapers also delved into Sheppard's
personal life. Articles stressed his extramarital love affairs as a motive for the
crime. The newspapers portrayed Sheppard as a Lothario, fully explored his
relationship with Susan Hayes, and named a number of other women who were
allegedly involved with him. The testimony at trial never showed that Sheppard
had any illicit relationships besides the one with Susan Hayes.
On July 28, an editorial entitled "Why Don't Police Quiz Top Suspect"
demanded that Sheppard be taken to police headquarters. It described him in
the following language:
"Now proved under oath to be a liar, still free to go about his business, shielded
by his family, protected by a smart lawyer who has made monkeys of the police
and authorities, carrying a gun part of the time, left free to do whatever he
pleases . . . ."

A front-page editorial on July 30 asked: "Why Isn't Sam Sheppard in Jail?" It
was later titled "Quit Stalling - Bring Him In." After calling Sheppard "the most
unusual murder suspect ever seen around these parts" the article said that
"[e]xcept for some superficial questioning during Coroner Sam Gerber's inquest
he has been scot-free of any official grilling . . . ." It asserted that he was
"surrounded by an iron curtain of protection [and] concealment."
That night at 10 o'clock Sheppard was arrested at his father's home on a charge
of murder. He was taken to the Bay Village City Hall where hundreds of people,
newscasters, photographers and reporters were awaiting his arrival. He was
immediately arraigned - having been denied a temporary delay to secure the
presence of counsel - and bound over to the grand jury.
The publicity then grew in intensity until his indictment on August 17. Typical
of the coverage during this period is a front-page interview entitled: "DR. SAM:
`I Wish There Was Something I Could Get Off My Chest - but There Isn't.'"
Unfavorable publicity included items such as a cartoon of the body of a sphinx
with Sheppard's head and the legend below: "`I Will Do Everything In My Power
to Help Solve This Terrible Murder.' - Dr. Sam Sheppard." Headlines announced,
inter alia, that: "Doctor Evidence is Ready for Jury," "Corrigan Tactics Stall
Quizzing," "Sheppard `Gay Set' Is Revealed By Houk," "Blood Is Found In
Garage," "New Murder Evidence Is Found, Police Claim," "Dr. Sam Faces Quiz
At Jail On Marilyn's Fear Of Him." On August 18, an article appeared under the
headline "Dr. Sam Writes His Own Story." And reproduced across the entire
front page was a portion of the typed statement signed by Sheppard: "I am not
guilty of the murder of my wife, Marilyn. How could I, who have been trained to
help people and devoted my life to saving life, commit such a terrible and
revolting crime?" We do not detail the coverage further. There are five volumes
filled with similar clippings from each of the three Cleveland newspapers
covering the period from the murder until Sheppard's conviction in December
1954. The record includes no excerpts from newscasts on radio and television

Robson

170

The First Amendment

but since space was reserved in the courtroom for these media we assume that
their coverage was equally large.
II.
With this background the case came on for trial two weeks before the November
general election at which the chief prosecutor was a candidate for common
pleas judge and the trial judge, Judge Blythin, was a candidate to succeed
himself. Twenty-five days before the case was set, 75 veniremen were called as
prospective jurors. All three Cleveland newspapers published the names and
addresses of the veniremen. As a consequence, anonymous letters and
telephone calls, as well as calls from friends, regarding the impending
prosecution were received by all of the prospective jurors. The selection of the
jury began on October 18, 1954.
The courtroom in which the trial was held measured 26 by 48 feet. A long
temporary table was set up inside the bar, in back of the single counsel table. It
ran the width of the courtroom, parallel to the bar railing, with one end less
than three feet from the jury box. Approximately 20 representatives of
newspapers and wire services were assigned seats at this table by the court.
Behind the bar railing there were four rows of benches. These seats were
likewise assigned by the court for the entire trial. The first row was occupied by
representatives of television and radio stations, and the second and third rows
by reporters from out-of-town newspapers and magazines. One side of the last
row, which accommodated 14 people, was assigned to Sheppard's family and
the other to Marilyn's. The public was permitted to fill vacancies in this row on
special passes only. Representatives of the news media also used all the rooms
on the courtroom floor, including the room where cases were ordinarily called
and assigned for trial. Private telephone lines and telegraphic equipment were
installed in these rooms so that reports from the trial could be speeded to the
papers. Station WSRS was permitted to set up broadcasting facilities on the
third floor of the courthouse next door to the jury room, where the jury rested
during recesses in the trial and deliberated. Newscasts were made from this
room throughout the trial, and while the jury reached its verdict.
On the sidewalk and steps in front of the courthouse, television and newsreel
cameras were occasionally used to take motion pictures of the participants in
the trial, including the jury and the judge. Indeed, one television broadcast
carried a staged interview of the judge as he entered the courthouse. In the
corridors outside the courtroom there was a host of photographers and
television personnel with flash cameras, portable lights and motion picture
cameras. This group photographed the prospective jurors during selection of
the jury. After the trial opened, the witnesses, counsel, and jurors were
photographed and televised whenever they entered or left the courtroom.
Sheppard was brought to the courtroom about 10 minutes before each session
began; he was surrounded by reporters and extensively photographed for the
newspapers and television. A rule of court prohibited picture-taking in the
courtroom during the actual sessions of the court, but no restraints were put
on photographers during recesses, which were taken once each morning and
afternoon, with a longer period for lunch.

Robson

171

The First Amendment

All of these arrangements with the news media and their massive coverage of
the trial continued during the entire nine weeks of the trial. The courtroom
remained crowded to capacity with representatives of news media. Their
movement in and out of the courtroom often caused so much confusion that,
despite the loud-speaker system installed in the courtroom, it was difficult for
the witnesses and counsel to be heard. Furthermore, the reporters clustered
within the bar of the small courtroom made confidential talk among Sheppard
and his counsel almost impossible during the proceedings. They frequently had
to leave the courtroom to obtain privacy. And many times when counsel wished
to raise a point with the judge out of the hearing of the jury it was necessary to
move to the judge's chambers. Even then, news media representatives so
packed the judge's anteroom that counsel could hardly return from the
chambers to the courtroom. The reporters vied with each other to find out what
counsel and the judge had discussed, and often these matters later appeared in
newspapers accessible to the jury.
The daily record of the proceedings was made available to the newspapers and
the testimony of each witness was printed verbatim in the local editions, along
with objections of counsel, and rulings by the judge. Pictures of Sheppard, the
judge, counsel, pertinent witnesses, and the jury often accompanied the daily
newspaper and television accounts. At times the newspapers published
photographs of exhibits introduced at the trial, and the rooms of Sheppard's
house were featured along with relevant testimony.
The jurors themselves were constantly exposed to the news media. Every juror,
except one, testified at voir dire to reading about the case in the Cleveland
papers or to having heard broadcasts about it. Seven of the 12 jurors who
rendered the verdict had one or more Cleveland papers delivered in their home;
the remaining jurors were not interrogated on the point. Nor were there
questions as to radios or television sets in the jurors' homes, but we must
assume that most of them owned such conveniences. As the selection of the
jury progressed, individual pictures of prospective members appeared daily.
During the trial, pictures of the jury appeared over 40 times in the Cleveland
papers alone. The court permitted photographers to take pictures of the jury in
the box, and individual pictures of the members in the jury room. One
newspaper ran pictures of the jurors at the Sheppard home when they went
there to view the scene of the murder. Another paper featured the home life of
an alternate juror. The day before the verdict was rendered - while the jurors
were at lunch and sequestered by two bailiffs - the jury was separated into two
groups to pose for photographs which appeared in the newspapers.
III.
We now reach the conduct of the trial. While the intense publicity continued
unabated, it is sufficient to relate only the more flagrant episodes:
1. On October 9, 1954, nine days before the case went to trial, an editorial in
one of the newspapers criticized defense counsel's random poll of people on the
streets as to their opinion of Sheppard's guilt or innocence in an effort to use
the resulting statistics to show the necessity for change of venue. The article
said the survey "smacks of mass jury tampering," called on defense counsel to
drop it, and stated that the bar association should do something about it. It

Robson

172

The First Amendment

characterized the poll as "non-judicial, non-legal, and nonsense." The article
was called to the attention of the court but no action was taken.
2. On the second day of voir dire examination a debate was staged and
broadcast live over WHK radio. The participants, newspaper reporters, accused
Sheppard's counsel of throwing roadblocks in the way of the prosecution and
asserted that Sheppard conceded his guilt by hiring a prominent criminal
lawyer. Sheppard's counsel objected to this broadcast and requested a
continuance, but the judge denied the motion. When counsel asked the court to
give some protection from such events, the judge replied that "WHK doesn't
have much coverage," and that "[a]fter all, we are not trying this case by radio
or in newspapers or any other means. We confine ourselves seriously to it in
this courtroom and do the very best we can."
3. While the jury was being selected, a two-inch headline asked: "But Who Will
Speak for Marilyn?" The front-page story spoke of the "perfect face" of the
accused. "Study that face as long as you want. Never will you get from it a hint
of what might be the answer . . . ." The two brothers of the accused were
described as "Prosperous, poised. His two sisters-in law. Smart, chic, wellgroomed. His elderly father. Courtly, reserved. A perfect type for the patriarch of
a staunch clan." The author then noted Marilyn Sheppard was "still off stage,"
and that she was an only child whose mother died when she was very young
and whose father had no interest in the case. But the author - through quotes
from Detective Chief James McArthur - assured readers that the prosecution's
exhibits would speak for Marilyn. "Her story," McArthur stated, "will come into
this courtroom through our witnesses." The article ends:
"Then you realize how what and who is missing from the perfect setting will be
supplied.
"How in the Big Case justice will be done.
"Justice to Sam Sheppard.
"And to Marilyn Sheppard."

4. As has been mentioned, the jury viewed the scene of the murder on the first
day of the trial. Hundreds of reporters, cameramen and onlookers were there,
and one representative of the news media was permitted to accompany the jury
while it inspected the Sheppard home. The time of the jury's visit was revealed
so far in advance that one of the newspapers was able to rent a helicopter and
fly over the house taking pictures of the jurors on their tour.
5. On November 19, a Cleveland police officer gave testimony that tended to
contradict details in the written statement Sheppard made to the Cleveland
police. Two days later, in a broadcast heard over Station WHK in Cleveland,
Robert Considine likened Sheppard to a perjurer and compared the episode to
Alger Hiss' confrontation with Whittaker Chambers. Though defense counsel
asked the judge to question the jury to ascertain how many heard the broadcast,
the court refused to do so. The judge also overruled the motion for continuance
based on the same ground, saying:
"Well, I don't know, we can't stop people, in any event, listening to it. It is a
matter of free speech, and the court can't control everybody. . . . We are not
going to harass the jury every morning. . . . It is getting to the point where if we

Robson

173

The First Amendment

do it every morning, we are suspecting the jury. I have confidence in this
jury . . . ."

6. On November 24, a story appeared under an eight-column headline: "Sam
Called A `Jekyll-Hyde' By Marilyn, Cousin To Testify." It related that Marilyn
had recently told friends that Sheppard was a "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"
character. No such testimony was ever produced at the trial. The story went on
to announce: "The prosecution has a `bombshell witness' on tap who will testify
to Dr. Sam's display of fiery temper - countering the defense claim that the
defendant is a gentle physician with an even disposition." Defense counsel
made motions for change of venue, continuance and mistrial, but they were
denied. No action was taken by the court.
7. When the trial was in its seventh week, Walter Winchell broadcast over
WXEL television and WJW radio that Carole Beasley, who was under arrest in
New York City for robbery, had stated that, as Sheppard's mistress, she had
borne him a child. The defense asked that the jury be queried on the broadcast.
Two jurors admitted in open court that they had heard it. The judge asked
each: "Would that have any effect upon your judgment?" Both replied, "No."
This was accepted by the judge as sufficient; he merely asked the jury to "pay
no attention whatever to that type of scavenging. . . . Let's confine ourselves to
this courtroom, if you please." In answer to the motion for mistrial, the judge
said:
"Well, even, so, Mr. Corrigan, how are you ever going to prevent those things, in
any event? I don't justify them at all. I think it is outrageous, but in a sense, it is
outrageous even if there were no trial here. The trial has nothing to do with it in
the Court's mind, as far as its outrage is concerned, but "Mr. CORRIGAN: I don't know what effect it had on the mind of any of these
jurors, and I can't find out unless inquiry is made.
"The COURT: How would you ever, in any jury, avoid that kind of a thing?"

8. On December 9, while Sheppard was on the witness stand he testified that
he had been mistreated by Cleveland detectives after his arrest. Although he
was not at the trial, Captain Kerr of the Homicide Bureau issued a press
statement denying Sheppard's allegations which appeared under the headline:
"`Bare-faced Liar,' Kerr Says of Sam." Captain Kerr never appeared as a witness
at the trial.
9. After the case was submitted to the jury, it was sequestered for its
deliberations, which took five days and four nights. After the verdict, defense
counsel ascertained that the jurors had been allowed to make telephone calls to
their homes every day while they were sequestered at the hotel. Although the
telephones had been removed from the jurors' rooms, the jurors were permitted
to use the phones in the bailiffs' rooms. The calls were placed by the jurors
themselves; no record was kept of the jurors who made calls, the telephone
numbers or the parties called. The bailiffs sat in the room where they could
hear only the jurors' end of the conversation. The court had not instructed the
bailiffs to prevent such calls. By a subsequent motion, defense counsel urged
that this ground alone warranted a new trial, but the motion was overruled and
no evidence was taken on the question.

Robson

The First Amendment

IV.
The principle that justice cannot survive behind walls of silence has long been
reflected in the "Anglo-American distrust for secret trials." A responsible press
has always been regarded as the handmaiden of effective judicial
administration, especially in the criminal field. Its function in this regard is
documented by an impressive record of service over several centuries. The press
does not simply publish information about trials but guards against the
miscarriage of justice by subjecting the police, prosecutors, and judicial
processes to extensive public scrutiny and criticism. This Court has, therefore,
been unwilling to place any direct limitations on the freedom traditionally
exercised by the news media for "[w]hat transpires in the court room is public
property." The "unqualified prohibitions laid down by the framers were intended
to give to liberty of the press . . . the broadest scope that could be countenanced
in an orderly society." Bridges v. California (1941). And where there was "no
threat or menace to the integrity of the trial," we have consistently required that
the press have a free hand, even though we sometimes deplored its
sensationalism.
But the Court has also pointed out that "[l]egal trials are not like elections, to be
won through the use of the meeting-hall, the radio, and the newspaper."
Bridges v. California. And the Court has insisted that no one be punished for a
crime without "a charge fairly made and fairly tried in a public tribunal free of
prejudice, passion, excitement, and tyrannical power." "Freedom of discussion
should be given the widest range compatible with the essential requirement of
the fair and orderly administration of justice." But it must not be allowed to
divert the trial from the "very purpose of a court system . . . to adjudicate
controversies, both criminal and civil, in the calmness and solemnity of the
courtroom according to legal procedures." Among these "legal procedures" is the
requirement that the jury's verdict be based on evidence received in open court,
not from outside sources. ***
Moreover, "the burden of showing essential unfairness . . . as a demonstrable
reality," need not be undertaken when television has exposed the community
"repeatedly and in depth to the spectacle of [the accused] personally confessing
in detail to the crimes with which he was later to be charged." In Turner v.
Louisiana (1965), two key witnesses were deputy sheriffs who doubled as jury
shepherds during the trial. The deputies swore that they had not talked to the
jurors about the case, but the Court nonetheless held that,
"even if it could be assumed that the deputies never did discuss the case directly
with any members of the jury, it would be blinking reality not to recognize the
extreme prejudice inherent in this continual association . . . ."

Only last Term in Estes v. Texas (1965), we set aside a conviction despite the
absence of any showing of prejudice. We said there:
"It is true that in most cases involving claims of due process deprivations we
require a showing of identifiable prejudice to the accused. Nevertheless, at times
a procedure employed by the State involves such a probability that prejudice will
result that it is deemed inherently lacking in due process." ***

V.

Robson

175

The First Amendment

It is clear that the totality of circumstances in this case also warrants such an
approach. Unlike Estes, Sheppard was not granted a change of venue to a
locale away from where the publicity originated; nor was his jury sequestered.
The Estes jury saw none of the television broadcasts from the courtroom. On
the contrary, the Sheppard jurors were subjected to newspaper, radio and
television coverage of the trial while not taking part in the proceedings. They
were allowed to go their separate ways outside of the courtroom, without
adequate directions not to read or listen to anything concerning the case. The
judge's "admonitions" at the beginning of the trial are representative:
"I would suggest to you and caution you that you do not read any newspapers
during the progress of this trial, that you do not listen to radio comments nor
watch or listen to television comments, insofar as this case is concerned. You
will feel very much better as the trial proceeds . . . . I am sure that we shall all
feel very much better if we do not indulge in any newspaper reading or listening
to any comments whatever about the matter while the case is in progress. After
it is all over, you can read it all to your heart's content . . . ."

At intervals during the trial, the judge simply repeated his "suggestions" and
"requests" that the jurors not expose themselves to comment upon the case.
Moreover, the jurors were thrust into the role of celebrities by the judge's failure
to insulate them from reporters and photographers. The numerous pictures of
the jurors, with their addresses, which appeared in the newspapers before and
during the trial itself exposed them to expressions of opinion from both cranks
and friends. The fact that anonymous letters had been received by prospective
jurors should have made the judge aware that this publicity seriously
threatened the jurors' privacy.
The press coverage of the Estes trial was not nearly as massive and pervasive as
the attention given by the Cleveland newspapers and broadcasting stations to
Sheppard's prosecution. Sheppard stood indicted for the murder of his wife;
the State was demanding the death penalty. For months the virulent publicity
about Sheppard and the murder had made the case notorious. Charges and
countercharges were aired in the news media besides those for which Sheppard
was called to trial. In addition, only three months before trial, Sheppard was
examined for more than five hours without counsel during a three-day inquest
which ended in a public brawl. The inquest was televised live from a high school
gymnasium seating hundreds of people. Furthermore, the trial began two weeks
before a hotly contested election at which both Chief Prosecutor Mahon and
Judge Blythin were candidates for judgeships.
While we cannot say that Sheppard was denied due process by the judge's
refusal to take precautions against the influence of pretrial publicity alone, the
court's later rulings must be considered against the setting in which the trial
was held. In light of this background, we believe that the arrangements made
by the judge with the news media caused Sheppard to be deprived of that
“judicial serenity and calm to which [he] was entitled.” The fact is that bedlam
reigned at the courthouse during the trial and newsmen took over practically
the entire courtroom, hounding most of the participants in the trial, especially
Sheppard. At a temporary table within a few feet of the jury box and counsel
table sat some 20 reporters staring at Sheppard and taking notes. The erection
of a press table for reporters inside the bar is unprecedented. The bar of the

Robson

176

The First Amendment

court is reserved for counsel, providing them a safe place in which to keep
papers and exhibits, and to confer privately with client and co-counsel. It is
designed to protect the witness and the jury from any distractions, intrusions
or influences, and to permit bench discussions of the judge's rulings away from
the hearing of the public and the jury. Having assigned almost all of the
available seats in the courtroom to the news media the judge lost his ability to
supervise that environment. The movement of the reporters in and out of the
courtroom caused frequent confusion and disruption of the trial. And the record
reveals constant commotion within the bar. Moreover, the judge gave the throng
of newsmen gathered in the corridors of the courthouse absolute free rein.
Participants in the trial, including the jury, were forced to run a gantlet of
reporters and photographers each time they entered or left the courtroom. The
total lack of consideration for the privacy of the jury was demonstrated by the
assignment to a broadcasting station of space next to the jury room on the floor
above the courtroom, as well as the fact that jurors were allowed to make
telephone calls during their five-day deliberation.
VI.
There can be no question about the nature of the publicity which surrounded
Sheppard's trial. We agree, as did the Court of Appeals, with the findings in
Judge Bell's opinion for the Ohio Supreme Court:
"Murder and mystery, society, sex and suspense were combined in this case in
such a manner as to intrigue and captivate the public fancy to a degree perhaps
unparalleled in recent annals. Throughout the preindictment investigation, the
subsequent legal skirmishes and the nine-week trial, circulation-conscious
editors catered to the insatiable interest of the American public in the
bizarre. . . . In this atmosphere of a `Roman holiday' for the news media, Sam
Sheppard stood trial for his life."

Indeed, every court that has considered this case, save the court that tried it,
has deplored the manner in which the news media inflamed and prejudiced the
public.
Much of the material printed or broadcast during the trial was never heard from
the witness stand, such as the charges that Sheppard had purposely impeded
the murder investigation and must be guilty since he had hired a prominent
criminal lawyer; that Sheppard was a perjurer; that he had sexual relations
with numerous women; that his slain wife had characterized him as a "JekyllHyde"; that he was "a bare-faced liar" because of his testimony as to police
treatment; and, finally, that a woman convict claimed Sheppard to be the father
of her illegitimate child. As the trial progressed, the newspapers summarized
and interpreted the evidence, devoting particular attention to the material that
incriminated Sheppard, and often drew unwarranted inferences from testimony.
At one point, a front-page picture of Mrs. Sheppard's blood-stained pillow was
published after being "doctored" to show more clearly an alleged imprint of a
surgical instrument.
Nor is there doubt that this deluge of publicity reached at least some of the jury.
On the only occasion that the jury was queried, two jurors admitted in open
court to hearing the highly inflammatory charge that a prison inmate claimed
Sheppard as the father of her illegitimate child. Despite the extent and nature of
the publicity to which the jury was exposed during trial, the judge refused
Robson

177

The First Amendment

defense counsel's other requests that the jurors be asked whether they had
read or heard specific prejudicial comment about the case, including the
incidents we have previously summarized. In these circumstances, we can
assume that some of this material reached members of the jury.
VII.
The court's fundamental error is compounded by the holding that it lacked
power to control the publicity about the trial. From the very inception of the
proceedings the judge announced that neither he nor anyone else could restrict
prejudicial news accounts. And he reiterated this view on numerous occasions.
Since he viewed the news media as his target, the judge never considered other
means that are often utilized to reduce the appearance of prejudicial material
and to protect the jury from outside influence. We conclude that these
procedures would have been sufficient to guarantee Sheppard a fair trial and so
do not consider what sanctions might be available against a recalcitrant press
nor the charges of bias now made against the state trial judge.
The carnival atmosphere at trial could easily have been avoided since the
courtroom and courthouse premises are subject to the control of the court. As
we stressed in Estes, the presence of the press at judicial proceedings must be
limited when it is apparent that the accused might otherwise be prejudiced or
disadvantaged. Bearing in mind the massive pretrial publicity, the judge should
have adopted stricter rules governing the use of the courtroom by newsmen, as
Sheppard's counsel requested. The number of reporters in the courtroom itself
could have been limited at the first sign that their presence would disrupt the
trial. They certainly should not have been placed inside the bar. Furthermore,
the judge should have more closely regulated the conduct of newsmen in the
courtroom. For instance, the judge belatedly asked them not to handle and
photograph trial exhibits lying on the counsel table during recesses.
Secondly, the court should have insulated the witnesses. All of the newspapers
and radio stations apparently interviewed prospective witnesses at will, and in
many instances disclosed their testimony. A typical example was the
publication of numerous statements by Susan Hayes, before her appearance in
court, regarding her love affair with Sheppard. Although the witnesses were
barred from the courtroom during the trial the full verbatim testimony was
available to them in the press. This completely nullified the judge's imposition
of the rule.
Thirdly, the court should have made some effort to control the release of leads,
information, and gossip to the press by police officers, witnesses, and the
counsel for both sides. Much of the information thus disclosed was inaccurate,
leading to groundless rumors and confusion. That the judge was aware of his
responsibility in this respect may be seen from his warning to Steve Sheppard,
the accused's brother, who had apparently made public statements in an
attempt to discredit testimony for the prosecution. ***
Defense counsel immediately brought to the court's attention the tremendous
amount of publicity in the Cleveland press that "misrepresented entirely the
testimony" in the case. Under such circumstances, the judge should have at
least warned the newspapers to check the accuracy of their accounts. And it is
obvious that the judge should have further sought to alleviate this problem by

Robson

178

The First Amendment

imposing control over the statements made to the news media by counsel,
witnesses, and especially the Coroner and police officers. The prosecution
repeatedly made evidence available to the news media which was never offered
in the trial. Much of the "evidence" disseminated in this fashion was clearly
inadmissible. The exclusion of such evidence in court is rendered meaningless
when news media make it available to the public. For example, the publicity
about Sheppard's refusal to take a lie detector test came directly from police
officers and the Coroner. The story that Sheppard had been called a "JekyllHyde" personality by his wife was attributed to a prosecution witness. No such
testimony was given. The further report that there was "a `bombshell witness'
on tap" who would testify as to Sheppard's "fiery temper" could only have
emanated from the prosecution. Moreover, the newspapers described in detail
clues that had been found by the police, but not put into the record.
The fact that many of the prejudicial news items can be traced to the
prosecution, as well as the defense, aggravates the judge's failure to take any
action. Effective control of these sources - concededly within the court's power might well have prevented the divulgence of inaccurate information, rumors,
and accusations that made up much of the inflammatory publicity, at least
after Sheppard's indictment.
More specifically, the trial court might well have proscribed extrajudicial
statements by any lawyer, party, witness, or court official which divulged
prejudicial matters, such as the refusal of Sheppard to submit to interrogation
or take any lie detector tests; any statement made by Sheppard to officials; the
identity of prospective witnesses or their probable testimony; any belief in guilt
or innocence; or like statements concerning the merits of the case. Being
advised of the great public interest in the case, the mass coverage of the press,
and the potential prejudicial impact of publicity, the court could also have
requested the appropriate city and county officials to promulgate a regulation
with respect to dissemination of information about the case by their employees.
In addition, reporters who wrote or broadcast prejudicial stories, could have
been warned as to the impropriety of publishing material not introduced in the
proceedings. The judge was put on notice of such events by defense counsel's
complaint about the WHK broadcast on the second day of trial. In this manner,
Sheppard's right to a trial free from outside interference would have been given
added protection without corresponding curtailment of the news media. Had the
judge, the other officers of the court, and the police placed the interest of justice
first, the news media would have soon learned to be content with the task of
reporting the case as it unfolded in the courtroom - not pieced together from
extrajudicial statements.
From the cases coming here we note that unfair and prejudicial news comment
on pending trials has become increasingly prevalent. Due process requires that
the accused receive a trial by an impartial jury free from outside influences.
Given the pervasiveness of modern communications and the difficulty of
effacing prejudicial publicity from the minds of the jurors, the trial courts must
take strong measures to ensure that the balance is never weighed against the
accused. And appellate tribunals have the duty to make an independent
evaluation of the circumstances. Of course, there is nothing that proscribes the
press from reporting events that transpire in the courtroom. But where there is

Robson

179

The First Amendment

a reasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair
trial, the judge should continue the case until the threat abates, or transfer it to
another county not so permeated with publicity. In addition, sequestration of
the jury was something the judge should have raised sua sponte with counsel.
If publicity during the proceedings threatens the fairness of the trial, a new trial
should be ordered. But we must remember that reversals are but palliatives;
the cure lies in those remedial measures that will prevent the prejudice at its
inception. The courts must take such steps by rule and regulation that will
protect their processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither
prosecutors, counsel for defense, the accused, witnesses, court staff nor
enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the court should be
permitted to frustrate its function. Collaboration between counsel and the press
as to information affecting the fairness of a criminal trial is not only subject to
regulation, but is highly censurable and worthy of disciplinary measures.
Since the state trial judge did not fulfill his duty to protect Sheppard from the
inherently prejudicial publicity which saturated the community and to control
disruptive influences in the courtroom, we must reverse the denial of the
habeas petition. The case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to
issue the writ and order that Sheppard be released from custody unless the
State puts him to its charges again within a reasonable time.
It is so ordered.

OPINION. POWELL, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION. BRENNAN, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION,
IN WHICH STEWART AND MARSHALL, J.J., JOINED. STEVENS FILED A CONCURRING OPINION.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The respondent State District Judge entered an order restraining the petitioners
from publishing or broadcasting accounts of confessions or admissions made
by the accused or facts "strongly implicative" of the accused in a widely reported
murder of six persons. We granted certiorari to decide whether the entry of
such an order on the showing made before the state court violated the
constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press.
I
On the evening of October 18, 1975, local police found the six members of the
Henry Kellie family murdered in their home in Sutherland, Neb., a town of
about 850 people. Police released the description of a suspect, Erwin Charles
Simants, to the reporters who had hastened to the scene of the crime. Simants
was arrested and arraigned in Lincoln County Court the following morning,
ending a tense night for this small rural community.

Robson

180

The First Amendment

The crime immediately attracted widespread news coverage, by local, regional,
and national newspapers, radio and television stations. *** [A broad initial
order prohibiting reporting was later amended by the Nebraska Supreme Court
and] prohibited reporting of only three matters: (a) the existence and nature of
any confessions or admissions made by the defendant to law enforcement
officers, (b) any confessions or admissions made to any third parties, except
members of the press, and (c) other facts "strongly implicative" of the accused.
The Nebraska Supreme Court did not rely on the Nebraska Bar-Press
Guidelines. After construing Nebraska law to permit closure in certain
circumstances, the court remanded the case to the District Judge for
reconsideration of the issue whether pretrial hearings should be closed to the
press and public.
We granted certiorari to address the important issues raised by the District
Court order as modified by the Nebraska Supreme Court, but we denied the
motion to expedite review or to stay entirely the order of the State District Court
pending Simants' trial. We are informed by the parties that since we granted
certiorari, Simants has been convicted of murder and sentenced to death. His
appeal is pending in the Nebraska Supreme Court.
II
The order at issue in this case expired by its own terms when the jury was
impaneled on January 7, 1976. There were no restraints on publication once
the jury was selected, and there are now no restrictions on what may be spoken
or written about the Simants case. Intervenor Simants argues that for this
reason the case is moot. *** [We] conclude that this case is not moot, and
proceed to the merits.
III
The problems presented by this case are almost as old as the Republic. Neither
in the Constitution nor in contemporaneous writings do we find that the conflict
between these two important rights was anticipated, yet it is inconceivable that
the authors of the Constitution were unaware of the potential conflicts between
the right to an unbiased jury and the guarantee of freedom of the press. The
unusually able lawyers who helped write the Constitution and later drafted the
Bill of Rights were familiar with the historic episode in which John Adams
defended British soldiers charged with homicide for firing into a crowd of
Boston demonstrators; they were intimately familiar with the clash of the
adversary system and the part that passions of the populace sometimes play in
influencing potential jurors. They did not address themselves directly to the
situation presented by this case; their chief concern was the need for freedom of
expression in the political arena and the dialogue in ideas. But they recognized
that there were risks to private rights from an unfettered press. ***
[Jefferson, for example, writing from Paris in 1786 concerning press attacks on
John Jay ***; The trial of Aaron Burr in 1807 presented Mr. Chief Justice
Marshall, presiding as a trial judge, with acute problems in selecting an
unbiased jury***]
The speed of communication and the pervasiveness of the modern news media
have exacerbated these problems, however, as numerous appeals demonstrate.

Robson

181

The First Amendment

The trial of Bruno Hauptmann in a small New Jersey community for the
abduction and murder of the Charles Lindberghs' infant child probably was the
most widely covered trial up to that time, and the nature of the coverage
produced widespread public reaction. Criticism was directed at the "carnival"
atmosphere that pervaded the community and the courtroom itself. Responsible
leaders of press and the legal profession - including other judges - pointed out
that much of this sorry performance could have been controlled by a vigilant
trial judge and by other public officers subject to the control of the court.
The excesses of press and radio and lack of responsibility of those in authority
in the Hauptmann case and others of that era led to efforts to develop voluntary
guidelines for courts, lawyers, press, and broadcasters. The effort was renewed
in 1965 when the American Bar Association embarked on a project to develop
standards for all aspects of criminal justice, including guidelines to
accommodate the right to a fair trial and the rights of a free press. See Powell,
The Right to a Fair Trial, 51 A. B. A. J. 534 (1965) [Lewis Powell was then
president of the ABA; he joined the Court as an Associate Justice in 1972]. The
resulting standards, approved by the Association in 1968, received support
from most of the legal profession. American Bar Association Project on
Standards for Criminal Justice, Fair Trial and Free Press (Approved Draft 1968).
Other groups have undertaken similar studies. ***
In practice, of course, even the most ideal guidelines are subjected to powerful
strains when a case such as Simants' arises, with reporters from many parts of
the country on the scene. Reporters from distant places are unlikely to consider
themselves bound by local standards. They report to editors outside the area
covered by the guidelines, and their editors are likely to be guided only by their
own standards. To contemplate how a state court can control acts of a
newspaper or broadcaster outside its jurisdiction, even though the newspapers
and broadcasts reach the very community from which jurors are to be selected,
suggests something of the practical difficulties of managing such guidelines.
The problems presented in this case have a substantial history outside the
reported decisions of courts, in the efforts of many responsible people to
accommodate the competing interests. We cannot resolve all of them, for it is
not the function of this Court to write a code. We look instead to this particular
case and the legal context in which it arises.
IV
The Sixth Amendment in terms guarantees "trial, by an impartial jury . . ." in
federal criminal prosecutions. Because "trial by jury in criminal cases is
fundamental to the American scheme of justice," the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the same right in state criminal
prosecutions. Duncan v. Louisiana (1968). ***
In the overwhelming majority of criminal trials, pretrial publicity presents few
unmanageable threats to this important right. But when the case is a
"sensational" one tensions develop between the right of the accused to trial by
an impartial jury and the rights guaranteed others by the First Amendment. ***
[Our cases demonstrate that] pretrial publicity - even pervasive, adverse
publicity - does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial. The capacity of the jury

Robson

182

The First Amendment

eventually impaneled to decide the case fairly is influenced by the tone and
extent of the publicity, which is in part, and often in large part, shaped by what
attorneys, police, and other officials do to precipitate news coverage. The trial
judge has a major responsibility. What the judge says about a case, in or out of
the courtroom, is likely to appear in newspapers and broadcasts. More
important, the measures a judge takes or fails to take to mitigate the effects of
pretrial publicity - the measures described in Sheppard - may well determine
whether the defendant receives a trial consistent with the requirements of due
process. That this responsibility has not always been properly discharged is
apparent from the decisions just reviewed.
*** The state trial judge in the case before us acted responsibility, out of a
legitimate concern, in an effort to protect the defendant's right to a fair trial.
What we must decided is not simply whether the Nebraska courts erred in
seeing the possibility of real danger to the defendant's rights, but whether in the
circumstances of this case the means employed were foreclosed by another
provision of the Constitution.
V
The First Amendment provides that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging
the freedom . . . of the press," and it is "no longer open to doubt that the liberty
of the press, and of speech, is within the liberty safeguarded by the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action." Near v.
Minnesota ex rel. Olson (1931). The Court has interpreted these guarantees to
afford special protection against orders that prohibit the publication or
broadcast of particular information or commentary - orders that impose a
"previous" or "prior" restraint on speech. None of our decided cases on prior
restraint involved restrictive orders entered to protect a defendant's right to a
fair and impartial jury, but the opinions on prior restraint have a common
thread relevant to this case. ***
The thread running through all these cases is that prior restraints on speech
and publication are the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on
First Amendment rights. A criminal penalty or a judgment in a defamation case
is subject to the whole panoply of protections afforded by deferring the impact
of the judgment until all avenues of appellate review have been exhausted. Only
after judgment has become final, correct or otherwise, does the law's sanction
become fully operative.
A prior restraint, by contrast and by definition, has an immediate and
irreversible sanction. If it can be said that a threat of criminal or civil sanctions
after publication "chills" speech, prior restraint "freezes" it at least for the time.
The damage can be particularly great when the prior restraint falls upon the
communication of news and commentary on current events. Truthful reports of
public judicial proceedings have been afforded special protection against
subsequent punishment. For the same reasons the protection against prior
restraint should have particular force as applied to reporting of criminal
proceedings, whether the crime in question is a single isolated act or a pattern
of criminal conduct. ***

Robson

183

The First Amendment

The extraordinary protections afforded by the First Amendment carry with them
something in the nature of a fiduciary duty to exercise the protected rights
responsibly - a duty widely acknowledged but not always observed by editors
and publishers. It is not asking too much to suggest that those who exercise
First Amendment rights in newspapers or broadcasting enterprises direct some
effort to protect the rights of an accused to a fair trial by unbiased jurors.
Of course, the order at issue - like the order requested in New York Times - does
not prohibit but only postpones publication. Some news can be delayed and
most commentary can even more readily be delayed without serious injury, and
there often is a self-imposed delay when responsible editors call for verification
of information. But such delays are normally slight and they are self-imposed.
Delays imposed by governmental authority are a different matter. ***
The authors of the Bill of Rights did not undertake to assign priorities as
between First Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights, ranking one as
superior to the other. In this case, the petitioners would have us declare the
right of an accused subordinate to their right to publish in all circumstances.
But if the authors of these guarantees, fully aware of the potential conflicts
between them, were unwilling or unable to resolve the issue by assigning to one
priority over the other, it is not for us to rewrite the Constitution by
undertaking what they declined to do. It is unnecessary, after nearly two
centuries, to establish a priority applicable in all circumstances. Yet it is
nonetheless clear that the barriers to prior restraint remain high unless we are
to abandon what the Court has said for nearly a quarter of our national
existence and implied throughout all of it. The history of even wartime
suspension of categorical guarantees, such as habeas corpus or the right to
trial by civilian courts, see Ex parte Milligan (1867), cautions against
suspending explicit guarantees. ***
VI
We turn now to the record in this case *** and must examine the evidence
before the trial judge when the order was entered to determine (a) the nature
and extent of pretrial news coverage; (b) whether other measures would be
likely to mitigate the effects of unrestrained pretrial publicity; and (c) how
effectively a restraining order would operate to prevent the threatened danger.
The precise terms of the restraining order are also important. We must then
consider whether the record supports the entry of a prior restraint on
publication, one of the most extraordinary remedies known to our
jurisprudence.
A
In assessing the probable extent of publicity, the trial judge had before him
newspapers demonstrating that the crime had already drawn intensive news
coverage, and the testimony of the County Judge, who had entered the initial
restraining order based on the local and national attention the case had
attracted. The District Judge was required to assess the probable publicity that
would be given these shocking crimes prior to the time a jury was selected and
sequestered. He then had to examine the probable nature of the publicity and
determine how it would affect prospective jurors.

Robson

184

The First Amendment

Our review of the pretrial record persuades us that the trial judge was justified
in concluding that there would be intense and pervasive pretrial publicity
concerning this case. He could also reasonably conclude, based on common
human experience, that publicity might impair the defendant's right to a fair
trial. He did not purport to say more, for he found only "a clear and present
danger that pre-trial publicity could impinge upon the defendant's right to a fair
trial." (Emphasis added.) His conclusion as to the impact of such publicity on
prospective jurors was of necessity speculative, dealing as he was with factors
unknown and unknowable.
B
We find little in the record that goes to another aspect of our task, determining
whether measures short of an order restraining all publication would have
insured the defendant a fair trial. Although the entry of the order might be read
as a judicial determination that other measures would not suffice, the trial
court made no express findings to that effect; the Nebraska Supreme Court
referred to the issue only by implication. ***
We have therefore examined this record to determine the probable efficacy of
the measures short of prior restraint on the press and speech. There is no
finding that alternative measures would not have protected Simants' rights, and
the Nebraska Supreme Court did no more than imply that such measures
might not be adequate. Moreover, the record is lacking in evidence to support
such a finding.
C
We must also assess the probable efficacy of prior restraint on publication as a
workable method of protecting Simants' right to a fair trial, and we cannot
ignore the reality of the problems of managing and enforcing pretrial restraining
orders. The territorial jurisdiction of the issuing court is limited by concepts of
sovereignty, see, e. g., Hanson v. Denckla (1958); Pennoyer v. Neff (1878). The
need for in personam jurisdiction also presents an obstacle to a restraining
order that applies to publication at large as distinguished from restraining
publication within a given jurisdiction. ***
Finally, we note that the events disclosed by the record took place in a
community of 850 people. It is reasonable to assume that, without any news
accounts being printed or broadcast, rumors would travel swiftly by word of
mouth. One can only speculate on the accuracy of such reports, given the
generative propensities of rumors; they could well be more damaging than
reasonably accurate news accounts. But plainly a whole community cannot be
restrained from discussing a subject intimately affecting life within it.
Given these practical problems, it is far from clear that prior restraint on
publication would have protected Simants' rights.
D
Finally, another feature of this case leads us to conclude that the restrictive
order entered here is not supportable. *** [The final order] enjoined reporting of
(1) "[c]onfessions or admissions against interest made by the accused to law
enforcement officials"; (2) "[c]onfessions or admissions against interest, oral or
written, if any, made by the accused to third parties, excepting any statements,
Robson

185

The First Amendment

if any, made by the accused to representatives of the news media"; and (3) all
"[o]ther information strongly implicative of the accused as the perpetrator of the
slayings."
To the extent that this order prohibited the reporting of evidence adduced at the
open preliminary hearing, it plainly violated settled principles: "[T]here is
nothing that proscribes the press from reporting events that transpire in the
courtroom." The County Court could not know that closure of the preliminary
hearing was an alternative open to it until the Nebraska Supreme Court so
construed state law; but once a public hearing had been held, what transpired
there could not be subject to prior restraint.
The third prohibition of the order was defective in another respect as well. As
part of a final order, entered after plenary review, this prohibition regarding
"implicative" information is too vague and too broad to survive the scrutiny we
have given to restraints on First Amendment rights. The third phase of the
order entered falls outside permissible limits.
E
The record demonstrates, as the Nebraska courts held, that there was indeed a
risk that pretrial news accounts, true or false, would have some adverse impact
on the attitudes of those who might be called as jurors. But on the record now
before us it is not clear that further publicity, unchecked, would so distort the
views of potential jurors that 12 could not be found who would, under proper
instructions, fulfill their sworn duty to render a just verdict exclusively on the
evidence presented in open court. We cannot say on this record that
alternatives to a prior restraint on petitioners would not have sufficiently
mitigated the adverse effects of pretrial publicity so as to make prior restraint
unnecessary. Nor can we conclude that the restraining order actually entered
would serve its intended purpose. Reasonable minds can have few doubts about
the gravity of the evil pretrial publicity can work, but the probability that it
would do so here was not demonstrated with the degree of certainty our cases
on prior restraint require.
Of necessity our holding is confined to the record before us. But our conclusion
is not simply a result of assessing the adequacy of the showing made in this
case; it results in part from the problems inherent in meeting the heavy burden
of demonstrating, in advance of trial, that without prior restraint a fair trial will
be denied. The practical problems of managing and enforcing restrictive orders
will always be present. In this sense, the record now before us is illustrative
rather than exceptional. It is significant that when this Court has reversed a
state conviction because of prejudicial publicity, it has carefully noted that
some course of action short of prior restraint would have made a critical
difference. However difficult it may be, we need not rule out the possibility of
showing the kind of threat to fair trial rights that would possess the requisite
degree of certainty to justify restraint. This Court has frequently denied that
First Amendment rights are absolute and has consistently rejected the
proposition that a prior restraint can never be employed.
Our analysis ends as it began, with a confrontation between prior restraint
imposed to protect one vital constitutional guarantee and the explicit command
of another that the freedom to speak and publish shall not be abridged. We

Robson

186

The First Amendment

reaffirm that the guarantees of freedom of expression are not an absolute
prohibition under all circumstances, but the barriers to prior restraint remain
high and the presumption against its use continues intact. We hold that, with
respect to the order entered in this case prohibiting reporting or commentary on
judicial proceedings held in public, the barriers have not been overcome; to the
extent that this order restrained publication of such material, it is clearly
invalid. To the extent that it prohibited publication based on information gained
from other sources, we conclude that the heavy burden imposed as a condition
to securing a prior restraint was not met and the judgment of the Nebraska
Supreme Court is therefore
Reversed.

as imposed upon lawyers. In Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S.
1030 (1991), a very fractured Court considered a disciplinary rule which
prohibited lawyers from making extrajudicial statements to the press
that they know or reasonably should know will have a "substantial
likelihood of materially prejudicing" an adjudicative proceeding, although
it also provided that “notwithstanding” this provision lawyers “may state
without elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . . defense.” The
Court found that the rule and its exception were void for vagueness,
concluding that it creates a trap for the wary as well as the unwary.
However, the Court found that the rule’s language prohibiting
“substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing" statements by attorneys
was a constitutionally permissible balance between the First Amendment
rights of attorneys in pending cases and the State's interest in fair trials.
Do you know the professional responsibility rules in the state where you
intend to practice regarding interactions with the press? Do you feel
confident you could abide by them? Do you have personal values
regarding dealing with the press as an attorney? How would you define
“press” in these instances?

467 U.S. 20 (1984)

POWELL, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION FOR A UNANIMOUS COURT. BRENNAN, J., FILED A
CONCURRING OPINION, IN WHICH MARSHALL, J., JOINED.

JUSTICE POWELL DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
This case presents the issue whether parties to civil litigation have a First
Amendment right to disseminate, in advance of trial, information gained
through the pretrial discovery process.
I
Respondent Rhinehart is the spiritual leader of a religious group, the Aquarian
Foundation. The Foundation has fewer than 1,000 members, most of whom live
in the State of Washington. Aquarian beliefs include life after death and the
ability to communicate with the dead through a medium. Rhinehart is the
primary Aquarian medium.
In recent years, the Seattle Times and the Walla Walla Union-Bulletin have
published stories about Rhinehart and the Foundation. Altogether 11 articles
appeared in the newspapers during the years 1973, 1978, and 1979. The five
articles that appeared in 1973 focused on Rhinehart and the manner in which
he operated the Foundation. They described seances conducted by Rhinehart in
which people paid him to put them in touch with deceased relatives and friends.
The articles also stated that Rhinehart had sold magical "stones" that had been
"expelled" from his body. One article referred to Rhinehart's conviction, later
vacated, for sodomy. The four articles that appeared in 1978 concentrated on
an "extravaganza" sponsored by Rhinehart at the Walla Walla State Penitentiary.
The articles stated that he had treated 1,100 inmates to a 6-hour-long show,
during which he gave away between $35,000 and $50,000 in cash and prizes.
One article described a "chorus line of girls [who] shed their gowns and bikinis
and sang . . . ." The two articles that appeared in 1979 referred to a purported
connection between Rhinehart and Lou Ferrigno, star of the popular television
program, "The Incredible Hulk."
II
Rhinehart brought this action in the Washington Superior Court on behalf of
himself and the Foundation against the Seattle Times, the Walla Walla UnionBulletin, the authors of the articles, and the spouses of the authors. Five female
members of the Foundation who had participated in the presentation at the
penitentiary joined the suit as plaintiffs. The complaint alleges that the articles
contained statements that were "fictional and untrue," and that the defendants
- petitioners here - knew, or should have known, they were false. According to
the complaint, the articles "did and were calculated to hold [Rhinehart] up to

Robson

188

The First Amendment

public scorn, hatred and ridicule, and to impeach his honesty, integrity, virtue,
religious philosophy, reputation as a person and in his profession as a spiritual
leader." With respect to the Foundation, the complaint also states: "[T]he
articles have, or may have had, the effect of discouraging contributions by the
membership and public and thereby diminished the financial ability of the
Foundation to pursue its corporate purposes." The complaint alleges that the
articles misrepresented the role of the Foundation's "choir" and falsely implied
that female members of the Foundation had "stripped off all their clothes and
wantonly danced naked . . . ." The complaint requests $14,100,000 in damages
for the alleged defamation and invasions of privacy.
Petitioners filed an answer, denying many of the allegations of the complaint
and asserting affirmative defenses. Petitioners promptly initiated extensive
discovery. They deposed Rhinehart, requested production of documents
pertaining to the financial affairs of Rhinehart and the Foundation, and served
extensive interrogatories on Rhinehart and the other respondents. Respondents
turned over a number of financial documents, including several of Rhinehart's
income tax returns. Respondents refused, however, to disclose certain financial
information, 4 the identity of the Foundation's donors during the preceding 10
years, and a list of its members during that period.
Petitioners filed a motion under the State's Civil Rule 37 requesting an order
compelling discovery. In their supporting memorandum, petitioners recognized
that the principal issue as to discovery was respondents'"refusa[l] to permit any
effective inquiry into their financial affairs, such as the source of their
donations, their financial transactions, uses of their wealth and assets, and
their financial condition in general." Respondents opposed the motion, arguing
in particular that compelled production of the identities of the Foundation's
donors and members would violate the First Amendment rights of members and
donors to privacy, freedom of religion, and freedom of association. Respondents
also moved for a protective order preventing petitioners from disseminating any
information gained through discovery. Respondents noted that petitioners had
stated their intention to continue publishing articles about respondents and
this litigation, and their intent to use information gained through discovery in
future articles.
In a lengthy ruling, the trial court initially granted the motion to compel and
ordered respondents to identify all donors who made contributions during the
five years preceding the date of the complaint, along with the amounts donated.
*** Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration in which they renewed their
motion for a protective order. They submitted affidavits of several Foundation
members to support their request. *** In general, the affidavits averred that
public release of the donor lists would adversely affect Foundation membership
and income and would subject its members to additional harassment and
reprisals.
Persuaded by these affidavits, the trial court issued a protective order covering
all information obtained through the discovery process that pertained to "the
financial affairs of the various plaintiffs, the names and addresses of Aquarian
Foundation members, contributors, or clients, and the names and addresses of
those who have been contributors, clients, or donors to any of the various
plaintiffs." The order prohibited petitioners from publishing, disseminating, or

Robson

189

The First Amendment

using the information in any way except where necessary to prepare for and try
the case. By its terms, the order did not apply to information gained by means
other than the discovery process. In an accompanying opinion, the trial court
recognized that the protective order would restrict petitioners' right to publish
information obtained by discovery, but the court reasoned that the restriction
was necessary to avoid the "chilling effect" that dissemination would have on "a
party's willingness to bring his case to court."
Respondents appealed from the trial court's production order, and petitioners
appealed from the protective order. The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed
both. *** The Supreme Court of Washington recognized that its holding
conflicts with the holdings of the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit *** and applies a different standard from that of the Court
of Appeals for the First Circuit *** . We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.
We affirm.
III
Most States, including Washington, have adopted discovery provisions modeled
on Rules 26 through 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 26(b)(1)
provides that a party "may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged,
which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action." It
further provides that discovery is not limited to matters that will be admissible
at trial so long as the information sought "appears reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence."
The Rules do not differentiate between information that is private or intimate
and that to which no privacy interests attach. Under the Rules, the only express
limitations are that the information sought is not privileged, and is relevant to
the subject matter of the pending action. Thus, the Rules often allow extensive
intrusion into the affairs of both litigants and third parties. If a litigant fails to
comply with a request for discovery, the court may issue an order directing
compliance that is enforceable by the court's contempt powers.
Petitioners argue that the First Amendment imposes strict limits on the
availability of any judicial order that has the effect of restricting expression.
They contend that civil discovery is not different from other sources of
information, and that therefore the information is "protected speech" for First
Amendment purposes. Petitioners assert the right in this case to disseminate
any information gained through discovery. They do recognize that in limited
circumstances, not thought to be present here, some information may be
restrained. They submit, however: "When a protective order seeks to limit
expression, it may do so only if the proponent shows a compelling governmental
interest. Mere speculation and conjecture are insufficient. Any restraining order,
moreover, must be narrowly drawn and precise. Finally, before issuing such an
order a court must determine that there are no alternatives which intrude less
directly on expression."
We think the rule urged by petitioners would impose an unwarranted
restriction on the duty and discretion of a trial court to oversee the discovery
process.
IV

Robson

190

The First Amendment

It is, of course, clear that information obtained through civil discovery
authorized by modern rules of civil procedure would rarely, if ever, fall within
the classes of unprotected speech identified by decisions of this Court. In this
case, as petitioners argue, there certainly is a public interest in knowing more
about respondents. This interest may well include most - and possibly all - of
what has been discovered as a result of the court's order under Rule 26(b)(1). It
does not necessarily follow, however, that a litigant has an unrestrained right to
disseminate information that has been obtained through pretrial discovery. For
even though the broad sweep of the First Amendment seems to prohibit all
restraints on free expression, this Court has observed that "[f]reedom of
speech . . . does not comprehend the right to speak on any subject at any time."
The critical question that this case presents is whether a litigant's freedom
comprehends the right to disseminate information that he has obtained
pursuant to a court order that both granted him access to that information and
placed restraints on the way in which the information might be used. In
addressing that question it is necessary to consider whether the "practice in
question [furthers] an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated
to the suppression of expression" and whether "the limitation of First
Amendment freedoms [is] no greater than is necessary or essential to the
protection of the particular governmental interest involved."
A
At the outset, it is important to recognize the extent of the impairment of First
Amendment rights that a protective order, such as the one at issue here, may
cause. As in all civil litigation, petitioners gained the information they wish to
disseminate only by virtue of the trial court's discovery processes. As the Rules
authorizing discovery were adopted by the state legislature, the processes
thereunder are a matter of legislative grace. A litigant has no First Amendment
right of access to information made available only for purposes of trying his suit.
Thus, continued court control over the discovered information does not raise
the same specter of government censorship that such control might suggest in
other situations.
Moreover, pretrial depositions and interrogatories are not public components of
a civil trial. Such proceedings were not open to the public at common law and,
in general, they are conducted in private as a matter of modern practice. Much
of the information that surfaces during pretrial discovery may be unrelated, or
only tangentially related, to the underlying cause of action. Therefore, restraints
placed on discovered, but not yet admitted, information are not a restriction on
a traditionally public source of information.
Finally, it is significant to note that an order prohibiting dissemination of
discovered information before trial is not the kind of classic prior restraint that
requires exacting First Amendment scrutiny. As in this case, such a protective
order prevents a party from disseminating only that information obtained
through use of the discovery process. Thus, the party may disseminate the
identical information covered by the protective order as long as the information
is gained through means independent of the court's processes. In sum, judicial
limitations on a party's ability to disseminate information discovered in advance
of trial implicates the First Amendment rights of the restricted party to a far

Robson

191

The First Amendment

lesser extent than would restraints on dissemination of information in a
different context. Therefore, our consideration of the provision for protective
orders contained in the Washington Civil Rules takes into account the unique
position that such orders occupy in relation to the First Amendment.
B
Rule 26(c) furthers a substantial governmental interest unrelated to the
suppression of expression. The Washington Civil Rules enable parties to
litigation to obtain information "relevant to the subject matter involved" that
they believe will be helpful in the preparation and trial of the case. Rule 26,
however, must be viewed in its entirety. Liberal discovery is provided for the
sole purpose of assisting in the preparation and trial, or the settlement, of
litigated disputes. Because of the liberality of pretrial discovery permitted by
Rule 26(b)(1), it is necessary for the trial court to have the authority to issue
protective orders conferred by Rule 26(c). It is clear from experience that
pretrial discovery by depositions and interrogatories has a significant potential
for abuse. This abuse is not limited to matters of delay and expense; discovery
also may seriously implicate privacy interests of litigants and third parties. The
Rules do not distinguish between public and private information. Nor do they
apply only to parties to the litigation, as relevant information in the hands of
third parties may be subject to discovery.
There is an opportunity, therefore, for litigants to obtain - incidentally or
purposefully - information that not only is irrelevant but if publicly released
could be damaging to reputation and privacy. The government clearly has a
substantial interest in preventing this sort of abuse of its processes. *** The
prevention of the abuse that can attend the coerced production of information
under a State's discovery rule is sufficient justification for the authorization of
protective orders.
C
We also find that the provision for protective orders in the Washington Rules
requires, in itself, no heightened First Amendment scrutiny. To be sure, Rule
26(c) confers broad discretion on the trial court to decide when a protective
order is appropriate and what degree of protection is required. The Legislature
of the State of Washington, following the example of the Congress in its
approval of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, has determined that such
discretion is necessary, and we find no' reason to disagree. The trial court is in
the best position to weigh fairly the competing needs and interests of parties
affected by discovery. The unique character of the discovery process requires
that the trial court have substantial latitude to fashion protective orders.
V
The facts in this case illustrate the concerns that justifiably may prompt a court
to issue a protective order. As we have noted, the trial court's order allowing
discovery was extremely broad. It compelled respondents - among other things to identify all persons who had made donations over a 5-year period to
Rhinehart and the Aquarian Foundation, together with the amounts donated. In
effect the order would compel disclosure of membership as well as sources of
financial support. The Supreme Court of Washington found that dissemination

Robson

192

The First Amendment

of this information would "result in annoyance, embarrassment and even
oppression." It is sufficient for purposes of our decision that the highest court
in the State found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision to issue a
protective order pursuant to a constitutional state law. We therefore hold that
where, as in this case, a protective order is entered on a showing of good cause
as required by Rule 26(c), is limited to the context of pretrial civil discovery, and
does not restrict the dissemination of the information if gained from other
sources, it does not offend the First Amendment.
The judgment accordingly is
Affirmed.

C.	   Access	  by	  the	  Press	  
Note:	  “Public	  Proceedings”	  	  

In fractured opinions in Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S.
555 (1980), the Court was nevertheless clear that there is a right of the
public and press to attend criminal trials. But this raises questions
about whether or not particular criminal proceedings or particular civil
proceedings are included in the definition of “trial.”
Whether or not a particular proceeding qualifies as “public” is often
analyzed with resort to the “complimentary” factors of
“experience” - whether the public has historically been granted
access to the place or process and
“logic” - whether access enhances the functioning of the particular
process in question,
as derived from the “Press–Enterprise” cases.
In Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of California for Riverside County,
464 U.S. 501 (1984) (“Press–Enterprise I”), the Court held voir dire
examinations in criminal jury trial should generally be public). In Press–
Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of California for Riverside County, 478 U.S.
1 (1986) ( “Press–Enterprise II”), the Court held that preliminary hearings
in criminal trial should generally be public).
Are executions “public” proceedings? Considering this issue, a district
judge in Oklahoma applied the Press-Enterprise cases and found that
while there were many public executions and hangings, the trend since
1915 has been to have such events occur within the prison. See

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER ANNOUNCED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT AND DELIVERED
AN OPINION, IN WHICH WHITE AND REHNQUIST, JJ., JOINED.
The question presented is whether the news media have a constitutional right of
access to a county jail, over and above that of other persons, to interview
inmates and make sound recordings, films, and photographs for publication
and broadcasting by newspapers, radio, and television.
I
Petitioner Houchins, as Sheriff of Alameda County, Cal., controls all access to
the Alameda County Jail at Santa Rita. Respondent KQED operates licensed
television and radio broadcasting stations which have frequently reported
newsworthy events relating to penal institutions in the San Francisco Bay Area.
On March 31, 1975, KQED reported the suicide of a prisoner in the Greystone
portion of the Santa Rita jail. The report included a statement by a psychiatrist
that the conditions at the Greystone facility were responsible for the illnesses of
his patient-prisoners there, and a statement from petitioner denying that prison
conditions were responsible for the prisoners' illnesses.
KQED requested permission to inspect and take pictures within the Greystone
facility. After permission was refused, KQED and the Alameda and Oakland
branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP) filed suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983. They alleged that petitioner had
violated the First Amendment by refusing to permit media access and failing to
provide any effective means by which the public could be informed of conditions
prevailing in the Greystone facility or learn of the prisoners' grievances. Public
access to such information was essential, they asserted, in order for NAACP
members to participate in the public debate on jail conditions in Alameda
County. They further asserted that television coverage of the conditions in the
cells and facilities was the most effective way of informing the public of prison
conditions.

Robson

194

The First Amendment

The complaint requested a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent
petitioner from "excluding KQED news personnel from the Greystone cells and
Santa Rita facilities and generally preventing full and accurate news coverage of
the conditions prevailing therein." On June 17, 1975, when the complaint was
filed, there appears to have been no formal policy regarding public access to the
Santa Rita jail. However, according to petitioner, he had been in the process of
planning a program of regular monthly tours since he took office six months
earlier. On July 8, 1975, he announced the program and invited all interested
persons to make arrangements for the regular public tours. News media were
given notice in advance of the public and presumably could have made early
reservations.
Six monthly tours were planned and funded by the county at an estimated cost
of $1,800. The first six scheduled tours were filled within a week after the July
8 announcement. A KQED reporter and several other reporters were on the first
tour on July 14, 1975.
Each tour was limited to 25 persons and permitted only limited access to the
jail. The tours did not include the disciplinary cells or the portions of the jail
known as "Little Greystone," the scene of alleged rapes, beatings, and adverse
physical conditions. Photographs of some parts of the jail were made available,
but no cameras or tape recorders were allowed on the tours. Those on the tours
were not permitted to interview inmates, and inmates were generally removed
from view.
In support of the request for a preliminary injunction, respondents presented
testimony and affidavits stating that other penal complexes had permitted
media interviews of inmates and substantial media access without experiencing
significant security or administrative problems. They contended that the
monthly public tours at Santa Rita failed to provide adequate access to the jail
for two reasons: (a) once the scheduled tours had been filled, media
representatives who had not signed up for them had no access and were unable
to cover newsworthy events at the jail; (b) the prohibition on photography and
tape recordings, the exclusion of portions of the jail from the tours, and the
practice of keeping inmates generally removed from view substantially reduced
the usefulness of the tours to the media.
In response, petitioner admitted that Santa Rita had never experimented with
permitting media access beyond that already allowed; he did not claim that
disruption had been caused by media access to other institutions. He asserted,
however, that unregulated access by the media would infringe inmate privacy, 2
and tend to create "jail celebrities," who in turn tend to generate internal
problems and undermine jail security. He also contended that unscheduled
media tours would disrupt jail operations.
Petitioner filed an affidavit noting the various means by which information
concerning the jail could reach the public. Attached to the affidavit were the
current prison mail, visitation, and phone call regulations. The regulations
allowed inmates to send an unlimited number of letters to judges, attorneys,
elected officials, the Attorney General, petitioner, jail officials, or probation
officers, all of which could be sealed prior to mailing. Other letters were subject

Robson

195

The First Amendment

to inspection for contraband but the regulations provided that no inmate mail
would be read.
With few exceptions, all persons, including representatives of the media, who
knew a prisoner could visit him. Media reporters could interview inmates
awaiting trial with the consent of the inmate, his attorney, the district attorney,
and the court. Social services officers were permitted to contact "relatives,
community agencies, employers, etc.," by phone to assist in counseling inmates
with vocational, educational, or personal problems. Maximum-security inmates
were free to make unmonitored collect telephone calls from designated areas of
the jail without limit.
After considering the testimony, affidavits, and documentary evidence presented
by the parties, the District Court preliminarily enjoined petitioner from denying
KQED news personnel and "responsible representatives" of the news media
access to the Santa Rita facilities, including Greystone, "at reasonable times
and hours" and "from preventing KQED news personnel and responsible
representatives of the news media from utilizing photographic and sound
equipment or from utilizing inmate interviews in providing full and accurate
coverage of the Santa Rita facilities."
The District Court rejected petitioner's contention that the media policy then in
effect was necessary to protect inmate privacy or minimize security and
administrative problems. It found that the testimony of officials involved with
other jails indicated that a "more flexible press policy at Santa Rita [was] both
desirable and attainable." The District Court concluded that the respondents
had "demonstrated irreparable injury, absence of an adequate remedy at law,
probability of success on the merits, a favorable public interest, and a balance
of hardships" in their favor.
On interlocutory appeal from the District Court's order, petitioner invoked Pell v.
Procunier (1974), where this Court held that "newsmen have no constitutional
right of access to prisons or their inmates beyond that afforded to the general
public." He contended that the District Court had departed from Pell and
abused its discretion because it had ordered that he give the media greater
access to the jail than he gave to the general public. The Court of Appeals
rejected petitioner's argument that Pell and Saxbe v. Washington Post Co. (1974),
were controlling. It concluded, albeit in three separate opinions, that the public
and the media had a First and Fourteenth Amendment right of access to
prisons and jails, and sustained the District Court's order.
II
Notwithstanding our holding in Pell v. Procunier respondents assert that the
right recognized by the Court of Appeals flows logically from our decisions
construing the First Amendment. They argue that there is a constitutionally
guaranteed right to gather news under Pell v. Procunier and Branzburg v. Hayes
(1972). From the right to gather news and the right to receive information, they
argue for an implied special right of access to government-controlled sources of
information. This right, they contend, compels access as a constitutional matter.
Respondents suggest further support for this implicit First Amendment right in
the language of Grosjean v. American Press Co. (1936), and Mills v. Alabama
(1966), which notes the importance of an informed public as a safeguard

Robson

The First Amendment

against "misgovernment" and the crucial role of the media in providing
information. Respondents contend that public access to penal institutions is
necessary to prevent officials from concealing prison conditions from the voters
and impairing the public's right to discuss and criticize the prison system and
its administration.
III
We can agree with many of the respondents' generalized assertions; conditions
in jails and prisons are clearly matters "of great public importance." Penal
facilities are public institutions which require large amounts of public funds,
and their mission is crucial in our criminal justice system. Each person placed
in prison becomes, in effect, a ward of the state for whom society assumes
broad responsibility. It is equally true that with greater information, the public
can more intelligently form opinions about prison conditions. Beyond question,
the role of the media is important; acting as the "eyes and ears" of the public,
they can be a powerful and constructive force, contributing to remedial action
in the conduct of public business. They have served that function since the
beginning of the Republic, but like all other components of our society media
representatives are subject to limits.
The media are not a substitute for or an adjunct of government and, like the
courts, they are "ill equipped" to deal with problems of prison administration.
We must not confuse the role of the media with that of government; each has
special, crucial functions, each complementing - and sometimes conflicting with
- the other.
The public importance of conditions in penal facilities and the media's role of
providing information afford no basis for reading into the Constitution a right of
the public or the media to enter these institutions, with camera equipment, and
take moving and still pictures of inmates for broadcast purposes. This Court
has never intimated a First Amendment guarantee of a right of access to all
sources of information within government control. Nor does the rationale of the
decisions upon which respondents rely lead to the implication of such a right.
Grosjean v. American Press Co., and Mills v. Alabama emphasized the
importance of informed public opinion and the traditional role of a free press as
a source of public information. But an analysis of those cases reveals that the
Court was concerned with the freedom of the media to communicate
information once it is obtained; neither case intimated that the Constitution
compels the government to provide the media with information or access to it
on demand. Grosjean involved a challenge to a state tax on advertising revenues
of newspapers, the "plain purpose" of which was to penalize the publishers and
curtail the publication of a selected group of newspapers. The Court
summarized the familiar but important history of the attempts to prevent
criticism of the Crown in England by the infamous licensing requirements and
special taxes on the press, and concluded that the First Amendment had been
designed to prevent similar restrictions or any other "form of previous restraint
upon printed publications, or their circulation."
In discussing the importance of an "untrammeled press," the Court in Grosjean
readily acknowledged the need for "informed public opinion" as a restraint upon
misgovernment. It also criticized the tax at issue because it limited " the

Robson

197

The First Amendment

circulation of information to which the public [was] entitled." But nothing in the
Court's holding implied a special privilege of access to information as
distinguished from a right to publish information which has been obtained;
Grosjean dealt only with government attempts to burden and restrain a
newspaper's communication with the public. The reference to a public
entitlement to information meant no more than that the government cannot
restrain communication of whatever information the media acquire - and which
they elect to reveal. ***
The right to receive ideas and information is not the issue in this case. The
issue is a claimed special privilege of access which the Court rejected in Pell
and Saxbe, a right which is not essential to guarantee the freedom to
communicate or publish.
IV
The respondents' argument is flawed, not only because it lacks precedential
support and is contrary to statements in this Court's opinions, but also because
it invites the Court to involve itself in what is clearly a legislative task which the
Constitution has left to the political processes. Whether the government should
open penal institutions in the manner sought by respondents is a question of
policy which a legislative body might appropriately resolve one way or the other.
A number of alternatives are available to prevent problems in penal facilities
from escaping public attention. The early penal reform movements in this
country and England gained impetus as a result of reports from citizens and
visiting committees who volunteered or received commissions to visit penal
institutions and make reports. See T. ERIKSSON, THE REFORMERS 32-42, 69
(Djurklou translation 1976); W. CRAWFORD, REPORT ON THE PENITENTIARIES OF THE
UNITED STATES vii-viii, xiii-xv, 10-11, App. 9 (1969 ed.); B. MCKELVEY, AMERICAN
PRISONS 52-56, 193 (1936). Citizen task forces and prison visitation committees
continue to play an important role in keeping the public informed on
deficiencies of prison systems and need for reforms. Grand juries, with the
potent subpoena power - not available to the media - traditionally concern
themselves with conditions in public institutions; a prosecutor or judge may
initiate similar inquiries, and the legislative power embraces an arsenal of
weapons for inquiry relating to tax-supported institutions. In each case, these
public bodies are generally compelled to publish their findings and, if they
default, the power of the media is always available to generate public pressure
for disclosure. But the choice as to the most effective and appropriate method is
a policy decision to be resolved by legislative decision. We must not confuse
what is "good," "desirable," or "expedient" with what is constitutionally
commanded by the First Amendment. To do so is to trivialize constitutional
adjudication.
Unarticulated but implicit in the assertion that media access to the jail is
essential for informed public debate on jail conditions is the assumption that
media personnel are the best qualified persons for the task of discovering
malfeasance in public institutions. But that assumption finds no support in the
decisions of this Court or the First Amendment. Editors and newsmen who
inspect a jail may decide to publish or not to publish what information they
acquire. Public bodies and public officers, on the other hand, may be coerced by

Robson

198

The First Amendment

public opinion to disclose what they might prefer to conceal. No comparable
pressures are available to anyone to compel publication by the media of what
they might prefer not to make known.
There is no discernible basis for a constitutional duty to disclose, or for
standards governing disclosure of or access to information. Because the
Constitution affords no guidelines, absent statutory standards, hundreds of
judges would, under the Court of Appeals' approach, be at large to fashion ad
hoc standards, in individual cases, according to their own ideas of what seems
"desirable" or "expedient." We, therefore, reject the Court of Appeals' conclusory
assertion that the public and the media have a First Amendment right to
government information regarding the conditions of jails and their inmates and
presumably all other public facilities such as hospitals and mental institutions.
***
Petitioner cannot prevent respondents from learning about jail conditions in a
variety of ways, albeit not as conveniently as they might prefer. Respondents
have a First Amendment right to receive letters from inmates criticizing jail
officials and reporting on conditions. Respondents are free to interview those
who render the legal assistance to which inmates are entitled. They are also free
to seek out former inmates, visitors to the prison, public officials, and
institutional personnel, as they sought out the complaining psychiatrist here.
Moreover, California statutes currently provide for a prison Board of Corrections
that has the authority to inspect jails and prisons and must provide a public
report at regular intervals. Health inspectors are required to inspect prisons
and provide reports to a number of officials, including the State Attorney
General and the Board of Corrections. Fire officials are also required to inspect
prisons. Following the reports of the suicide at the jail involved here, the County
Board of Supervisors called for a report from the County Administrator; held a
public hearing on the report, which was open to the media; and called for
further reports when the initial report failed to describe the conditions in the
cells in the Greystone portion of the jail.
Neither the First Amendment nor the Fourteenth Amendment mandates a right
of access to government information or sources of information within the
government's control. Under our holdings *** until the political branches decree
otherwise, as they are free to do, the media have no special right of access to
the Alameda County Jail different from or greater than that accorded the public
generally.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings.
Reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE STEWART, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
I agree that the preliminary injunction issued against the petitioner was
unwarranted, and therefore concur in the judgment. In my view, however,
KQED was entitled to injunctive relief of more limited scope.

Robson

199

The First Amendment

The First and Fourteenth Amendments do not guarantee the public a right of
access to information generated or controlled by government, nor do they
guarantee the press any basic right of access superior to that of the public
generally. The Constitution does no more than assure the public and the press
equal access once government has opened its doors. Accordingly, I agree
substantially with what the opinion of The Chief Justice has to say on that
score.
We part company, however, in applying these abstractions to the facts of this
case. Whereas he appears to view "equal access" as meaning access that is
identical in all respects, I believe that the concept of equal access must be
accorded more flexibility in order to accommodate the practical distinctions
between the press and the general public.
When on assignment, a journalist does not tour a jail simply for his own
edification. He is there to gather information to be passed on to others, and his
mission is protected by the Constitution for very specific reasons. ***
That the First Amendment speaks separately of freedom of speech and freedom
of the press is no constitutional accident, but an acknowledgment of the critical
role played by the press in American society. The Constitution requires
sensitivity to that role, and to the special needs of the press in performing it
effectively. A person touring Santa Rita jail can grasp its reality with his own
eyes and ears. But if a television reporter is to convey the jail's sights and
sounds to those who cannot personally visit the place, he must use cameras
and sound equipment. In short, terms of access that are reasonably imposed on
individual members of the public may, if they impede effective reporting without
sufficient justification, be unreasonable as applied to journalists who are there
to convey to the general public what the visitors see.
Under these principles, KQED was clearly entitled to some form of preliminary
injunctive relief. At the time of the District Court's decision, members of the
public were permitted to visit most parts of the Santa Rita jail, and the First
and Fourteenth Amendments required the Sheriff to give members of the press
effective access to the same areas. The Sheriff evidently assumed that he could
fulfill this obligation simply by allowing reporters to sign up for tours on the
same terms as the public. I think he was mistaken in this assumption, as a
matter of constitutional law. ***
I would not foreclose the possibility of further relief for KQED on remand. In my
view, the availability and scope of future permanent injunctive relief must
depend upon the extent of access then permitted the public, and the decree
must be framed to accommodate equitably the constitutional role of the press
and the institutional requirements of the jail.
JUSTICE STEVENS, WITH WHOM BRENNAN AND POWELL, JJ., JOIN, DISSENTING.
The Court holds that the scope of press access to the Santa Rita jail required by
the preliminary injunction issued against petitioner is inconsistent with the
holding in Pell v. Procunier that "newsmen have no constitutional right of access
to prisons or their inmates beyond that afforded the general public" and

Robson

200

The First Amendment

therefore the injunction was an abuse of the District Court's discretion. I
respectfully disagree. ***
For two reasons, which will be discussed separately, the decisions in Pell and
Saxbe do not control the propriety of the District Court's preliminary injunction.
First, the unconstitutionality of petitioner's policies which gave rise to this
litigation does not rest on the premise that the press has a greater right of
access to information regarding prison conditions than do other members of the
public. Second, relief tailored to the needs of the press may properly be awarded
to a representative of the press which is successful in proving that it has been
harmed by a constitutional violation and need not await the grant of relief to
members of the general public who may also have been injured by petitioner's
unconstitutional access policy but have not yet sought to vindicate their rights.
I
This litigation grew out of petitioner's refusal to allow representatives of the
press access to the inner portions of the Santa Rita facility. Following those
refusals and the institution of this suit, certain remedial action was taken by
petitioner. The mail censorship was relaxed and an experimental tour program
was initiated. ***
Here, the broad restraints on access to information regarding operation of the
jail that prevailed on the date this suit was instituted are plainly disclosed by
the record. The public and the press had consistently been denied any access to
those portions of the Santa Rita facility where inmates were confined and there
had been excessive censorship of inmate correspondence. Petitioner's no-access
policy, modified only in the wake of respondents' resort to the courts, could
survive constitutional scrutiny only if the Constitution affords no protection to
the public's right to be informed about conditions within those public
institutions where some of its members are confined because they have been
charged with or found guilty of criminal offenses.
II
The preservation of a full and free flow of information to the general public has
long been recognized as a core objective of the First Amendment to the
Constitution. It is for this reason that the First Amendment protects not only
the dissemination but also the receipt of information and ideas. Thus, in
Procunier v. Martinez, the Court invalidated prison regulations authorizing
excessive censorship of outgoing inmate correspondence because such
censorship abridged the rights of the intended recipients. So here, petitioner's
prelitigation prohibition on mentioning the conduct of jail officers in outgoing
correspondence must be considered an impingement on the noninmate
correspondent's interest in receiving the intended communication.
In addition to safeguarding the right of one individual to receive what another
elects to communicate, the First Amendment serves an essential societal
function. Our system of self-government assumes the existence of an informed
citizenry. As Madison wrote:
"A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring
it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will

Robson

201

The First Amendment

forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors,
must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives."

9 WRITINGS OF JAMES MADISON 103 (G. Hunt ed. 1910).
It is not sufficient, therefore, that the channels of communication be free of
governmental restraints. Without some protection for the acquisition of
information about the operation of public institutions such as prisons by the
public at large, the process of self-governance contemplated by the Framers
would be stripped of its substance.
For that reason information gathering is entitled to some measure of
constitutional protection. As this Court's decisions clearly indicate, however,
this protection is not for the private benefit of those who might qualify as
representatives of the "press" but to insure that the citizens are fully informed
regarding matters of public interest and importance.
In Grosjean v. American Press Co. representatives of the "press" challenged a
state tax on the advertising revenues of newspapers. In the Court's words, the
issue raised by the tax went "to the heart of the natural right of the members of
an organized society, united for their common good, to impart and acquire
information about their common interests." The opinion described the long
struggle in England against the stamp tax and tax on advertisements - the socalled "taxes on knowledge":
"[I]n the adoption of the [taxes] the dominant and controlling aim was to prevent,
or curtail the opportunity for, the acquisition of knowledge by the people in
respect of their governmental affairs. . . . The aim of the struggle [against those
taxes] was . . . to establish and preserve the right of the English people to full
information in respect of the doings or misdoings of their government. Upon the
correctness of this conclusion the very characterization of the exactions as
`taxes on knowledge' sheds a flood of corroborative light. In the ultimate, an
informed and enlightened public opinion was the thing at stake."

Noting the familiarity of the Framers with this struggle, the Court held:
"[S]ince informed public opinion is the most potent of all restraints upon
misgovernment, the suppression or abridgement of the publicity afforded by a
free press cannot be regarded otherwise than with grave concern. The tax here
involved is bad . . . because, in light of its history and of its present setting, it is
seen to be a deliberate and calculated device . . . to limit the circulation of
information to which the public is entitled in virtue of the constitutional
guaranties."

A recognition that the "underlying right is the right of the public generally" is
also implicit in the doctrine that "newsmen have no constitutional right of
access to prisons or their inmates beyond that afforded the general public." Pell
v. Procunier. In Pell it was unnecessary to consider the extent of the public's
right of access to information regarding the prison and its inmates in order to
adjudicate the press claim to a particular form of access, since the record
demonstrated that the flow of information to the public, both directly and
through the press, was adequate to survive constitutional challenge;
institutional considerations justified denying the single, additional mode of
access sought by the press in that case.

Robson

202

The First Amendment

Here, in contrast, the restrictions on access to the inner portions of the Santa
Rita jail that existed on the date this litigation commenced concealed from the
general public the conditions of confinement within the facility. The question is
whether petitioner's policies, which cut off the flow of information at its source,
abridged the public's right to be informed about those conditions.
The answer to that question does not depend upon the degree of public
disclosure which should attend the operation of most governmental activity.
Such matters involve questions of policy which generally must be resolved by
the political branches of government. Moreover, there are unquestionably
occasions when governmental activity may properly be carried on in complete
secrecy. For example, the public and the press are commonly excluded from
"grand jury proceedings, our own conferences, [and] the meetings of other
official bodies gathered in executive session . . . ." Branzburg v. Hayes. In
addition, some functions of government - essential to the protection of the
public and indeed our country's vital interests - necessarily require a large
measure of secrecy, subject to appropriate legislative oversight. In such
situations the reasons for withholding information from the public are both
apparent and legitimate.
In this case, however, "[r]espondents do not assert a right to force disclosure of
confidential information or to invade in any way the decisionmaking processes
of governmental officials." They simply seek an end to petitioner's policy of
concealing prison conditions from the public. Those conditions are wholly
without claim to confidentiality. While prison officials have an interest in the
time and manner of public acquisition of information about the institutions
they administer, there is no legitimate penological justification for concealing
from citizens the conditions in which their fellow citizens are being confined.
*** The reasons which militate in favor of providing special protection to the
flow of information to the public about prisons relate to the unique function
they perform in a democratic society. Not only are they public institutions,
financed with public funds and administered by public servants, they are an
integral component of the criminal justice system. The citizens confined therein
are temporarily, and sometimes permanently, deprived of their liberty as a
result of a trial which must conform to the dictates of the Constitution. By
express command of the Sixth Amendment the proceeding must be a "public
trial." It is important not only that the trial itself be fair, but also that the
community at large have confidence in the integrity of the proceeding. That
public interest survives the judgment of conviction and appropriately carries
over to an interest in how the convicted person is treated during his period of
punishment and hoped-for rehabilitation. While a ward of the State and subject
to its stern discipline, he retains constitutional protections against cruel and
unusual punishment, a protection which may derive more practical support
from access to information about prisons by the public than by occasional
litigation in a busy court.
Some inmates - in Santa Rita, a substantial number - are pretrial detainees.
Though confined pending trial, they have not been convicted of an offense
against society and are entitled to the presumption of innocence. Certain
penological objectives, i. e., punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, which
are legitimate in regard to convicted prisoners, are inapplicable to pretrial

Robson

203

The First Amendment

detainees. Society has a special interest in ensuring that unconvicted citizens
are treated in accord with their status.
In this case, the record demonstrates that both the public and the press had
been consistently denied any access to the inner portions of the Santa Rita jail,
that there had been excessive censorship of inmate correspondence, and that
there was no valid justification for these broad restraints on the flow of
information. ***
III
The preliminary injunction entered by the District Court granted relief to KQED
without providing any specific remedy for other members of the public.
Moreover, it imposed duties on petitioner that may not be required by the
Constitution itself. The injunction was not an abuse of discretion for either of
these reasons. ***
I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Notes	  	  
1.
How effective do you think the Court’s suggested alternatives to
press access to the prison would be? Do you think that the current
prison conditions would be improved - - - or at least different - - - had
the Court reached a different conclusion in KQED?
2.
Press access to military operations is similarly contested. In Nation
Magazine v. U.S. Dep't of Def., 762 F. Supp. 1558 (S.D.N.Y. 1991), a
district judge rejected the claim of a number of publications that the
press has a First Amendment right to unlimited access to a foreign arena
in which American military forces are engaged. The plaintiffs had urged
that the Department of Defense (DOD) “pooling” regulations, which limit
access to the battlefield to a specified number of press representatives
and subject them to certain restrictions, infringe on news gathering
privileges accorded by the First Amendment. The plaintiffs - - -including
The Nation, Mother Jones, The Progressive Magazine, The Village Voice,
and Pacifica Radio News - - - also contended that the DOD preferences
for certain news organizations and reporters discriminated in favor of
particular viewpoints, but the court found that this claim was not
adequately supported.
The subsequent process of “embedding” reporters is also subject to
First Amendment concerns, including discrimination and distortion of
the news. For an excellent discussion see Student Note, Elana J. Zeide,
In Bed with the Military: First Amendment Implications of Embedded
Journalism, 80 N.Y.U. L. REV. 1309 (2005).

D.	  	   (Un)lawful	  Information	  

Members of the press routinely use statutory or regulatory provisions
such as the federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, and its
state counterparts to obtain “public” information.
They also use other means, including the receipt of anonymous
information which may have been gathered through unlawful means.

Note:	  Bartnicki	  v.	  Vopper	  
In Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 (2001), the Court held that a
statutory wiretapping prohibition could not be constitutionally applied to
a radio host who played a tape of an intercepted conversation on his
radio show. The host received the tape anonymously, but had reason to
know that the conversation had been illegally intercepted. Title III of the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended,
generally prohibited the interception of wire, electronic, and oral
communications. Title 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(a) applies to the person who
willfully intercepts such communications and subsection (c) to any
person who, knowing or having reason to know that the communication
was obtained through an illegal interception, willfully discloses its
contents.
The Court’s opinion, authored by Justice Stevens, stated:
The Government identifies two interests served by the statute — first, the
interest in removing an incentive for parties to intercept private conversations,
and second, the interest in minimizing the harm to persons whose conversations
have been illegally intercepted. We assume that those interests adequately
justify the prohibition in § 2511(1)(d) against the interceptor's own use of
information that he or she acquired by violating § 2511(1)(a), but it by no means
follows that punishing disclosures of lawfully obtained information of public
interest by one not involved in the initial illegality is an acceptable means of
serving those ends.

The Court considered the first interest not served by prohibiting third
parties from disclosing the information, but took the second interest
more seriously. The Court concluded, however, that in this case - - involving a conversation between members of a teachers’ union in
negotiations and a possible strike - - - an application of the anti-wiretap
statute “implicates the core purposes of the First Amendment because it
imposes sanctions on the publication of truthful information of public
concern.”
The months of negotiations over the proper level of compensation for
teachers at the Wyoming Valley West High School were unquestionably a
matter of public concern, and respondents were clearly engaged in

Robson

205

The First Amendment

debate about that concern. That debate may be more mundane than the
Communist rhetoric that inspired Justice Brandeis' classic opinion in
Whitney v. California (1919), but it is no less worthy of constitutional
protection.
In these cases, privacy concerns give way when balanced against the
interest in publishing matters of public importance.

FILED A DISSENTING OPINION. STEWART, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH BRENNAN AND
MARSHALL, JJ., JOINED.

OPINION OF THE COURT BY MR. JUSTICE WHITE, ANNOUNCED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE
The issue in these cases is whether requiring newsmen to appear and testify
before state or federal grand juries abridges the freedom of speech and press
guaranteed by the First Amendment. We hold that it does not.
[There were three consolidated cases: Branzburg was a reporter for the
Louisville, Kentucky newspaper the Courier-Journal, who published articles
including his observations of people “synthesizing hashish from marihuana”
and the “drug scene” in Kentucky; Pappas was a television reporterphotographer in Providence, Rhode Island who gained entrance to a Black
Panther headquarters waiting for a police raid that did not occur and did not
write about the incident; and Caldwell was a “reporter for the New York Times
assigned to cover the Black Panther Party” in Northern California. All three
were subpoenaed by grand juries].
Petitioners Branzburg and Pappas and respondent Caldwell press First
Amendment claims that may be simply put: that to gather news it is often
necessary to agree either not to identify the source of information published or
to publish only part of the facts revealed, or both; that if the reporter is
nevertheless forced to reveal these confidences to a grand jury, the source so
identified and other confidential sources of other reporters will be measurably
deterred from furnishing publishable information, all to the detriment of the
free flow of information protected by the First Amendment. Although the
newsmen in these cases do not claim an absolute privilege against official
interrogation in all circumstances, they assert that the reporter should not be
forced either to appear or to testify before a grand jury or at trial until and
unless sufficient grounds are shown for believing that the reporter possesses
information relevant to a crime the grand jury is investigating, that the
information the reporter has is unavailable from other sources, and that the

Robson

206

The First Amendment

need for the information is sufficiently compelling to override the claimed
invasion of First Amendment interests occasioned by the disclosure. Principally
relied upon are prior cases emphasizing the importance of the First Amendment
guarantees to individual development and to our system of representative
government, decisions requiring that official action with adverse impact on First
Amendment rights be justified by a public interest that is "compelling" or
"paramount," and those precedents establishing the principle that justifiable
governmental goals may not be achieved by unduly broad means having an
unnecessary impact on protected rights of speech, press, or association. The
heart of the claim is that the burden on news gathering resulting from
compelling reporters to disclose confidential information outweighs any public
interest in obtaining the information.
We do not question the significance of free speech, press, or assembly to the
country's welfare. Nor is it suggested that news gathering does not qualify for
First Amendment protection; without some protection for seeking out the news,
freedom of the press could be eviscerated. But these cases involve no intrusions
upon speech or assembly, no prior restraint or restriction on what the press
may publish, and no express or implied command that the press publish what
it prefers to withhold. No exaction or tax for the privilege of publishing, and no
penalty, civil or criminal, related to the content of published material is at issue
here. The use of confidential sources by the press is not forbidden or restricted;
reporters remain free to seek news from any source by means within the law.
No attempt is made to require the press to publish its sources of information or
indiscriminately to disclose them on request.
The sole issue before us is the obligation of reporters to respond to grand jury
subpoenas as other citizens do and to answer questions relevant to an
investigation into the commission of crime. Citizens generally are not
constitutionally immune from grand jury subpoenas; and neither the First
Amendment nor any other constitutional provision protects the average citizen
from disclosing to a grand jury information that he has received in confidence.
The claim is, however, that reporters are exempt from these obligations because
if forced to respond to subpoenas and identify their sources or disclose other
confidences, their informants will refuse or be reluctant to furnish newsworthy
information in the future. This asserted burden on news gathering is said to
make compelled testimony from newsmen constitutionally suspect and to
require a privileged position for them.
***The prevailing view is that the press is not free to publish with impunity
everything and anything it desires to publish. Although it may deter or regulate
what is said or published, the press may not circulate knowing or reckless
falsehoods damaging to private reputation without subjecting itself to liability
for damages, including punitive damages, or even criminal prosecution. ***
Despite the fact that news gathering may be hampered, the press is regularly
excluded from grand jury proceedings, our own conferences, the meetings of
other official bodies gathered in executive session, and the meetings of private
organizations. Newsmen have no constitutional right of access to the scenes of

prohibited from attending or publishing information about trials if such
restrictions are necessary to assure a defendant a fair trial before an impartial
tribunal. ***
It is thus not surprising that the great weight of authority is that newsmen are
not exempt from the normal duty of appearing before a grand jury and
answering questions relevant to a criminal investigation. At common law, courts
consistently refused to recognize the existence of any privilege authorizing a
newsman to refuse to reveal confidential information to a grand jury. ***
A number of States have provided newsmen a statutory privilege of varying
breadth, but the majority have not done so, and none has been provided by
federal statute. Until now the only testimonial privilege for unofficial witnesses
that is rooted in the Federal Constitution is the Fifth Amendment privilege
against compelled self-incrimination. We are asked to create another by
interpreting the First Amendment to grant newsmen a testimonial privilege that
other citizens do not enjoy. This we decline to do. ***
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, CONCURRING.
I add this brief statement to emphasize what seems to me to be the limited
nature of the Court's holding. The Court does not hold that newsmen,
subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, are without constitutional rights with
respect to the gathering of news or in safeguarding their sources. Certainly, we
do not hold, as suggested in Mr. Justice Stewart's dissenting opinion, that state
and federal authorities are free to "annex" the news media as "an investigative
arm of government." The solicitude repeatedly shown by this Court for First
Amendment freedoms should be sufficient assurance against any such effort,
even if one seriously believed that the media - properly free and untrammeled in
the fullest sense of these terms - were not able to protect themselves.
As indicated in the concluding portion of the opinion, the Court states that no
harassment of newsmen will be tolerated. If a newsman believes that the grand
jury investigation is not being conducted in good faith he is not without remedy.
Indeed, if the newsman is called upon to give information bearing only a remote
and tenuous relationship to the subject of the investigation, or if he has some
other reason to believe that his testimony implicates confidential source
relationships without a legitimate need of law enforcement, he will have access
to the court on a motion to quash and an appropriate protective order may be
entered. The asserted claim to privilege should be judged on its facts by the
striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation of
all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct. The
balance of these vital constitutional and societal interests on a case-by-case
basis accords with the tried and traditional way of adjudicating such questions.
[Footnote*]
In short, the courts will be available to newsmen under circumstances where
legitimate First Amendment interests require protection.

The First Amendment

[ Footnote * ] It is to be remembered that Caldwell asserts a constitutional privilege not even to
appear before the grand jury unless a court decides that the Government has made a showing
that meets the three preconditions specified in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Stewart. To
be sure, this would require a "balancing" of interests by the court, but under circumstances and
constraints significantly different from the balancing that will be appropriate under the court's
decision. The newsman witness, like all other witnesses, will have to appear; he will not be in a
position to litigate at the threshold the State's very authority to subpoena him. Moreover, absent
the constitutional preconditions that Caldwell and that dissenting opinion would impose as heavy
burdens of proof to be carried by the State, the court - when called upon to protect a newsman
from improper or prejudicial questioning - would be free to balance the competing interests on
their merits in the particular case. The new constitutional rule endorsed by that dissenting
opinion would, as a practical matter, defeat such a fair balancing and the essential societal
interest in the detection and prosecution of crime would be heavily subordinated.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, DISSENTING.
*** The starting point for decision pretty well marks the range within which the
end result lies. The New York Times, whose reporting functions are at issue
here, takes the amazing position that First Amendment rights are to be
balanced against other needs or conveniences of government. My belief is that
all of the "balancing" was done by those who wrote the Bill of Rights. By casting
the First Amendment in absolute terms, they repudiated the timid, watereddown, emasculated versions of the First Amendment which both the
Government and the New York Times advance in the case. ***
I see no way of making mandatory the disclosure of a reporter's confidential
source of the information on which he bases his news story. *** The press has a
preferred position in our constitutional scheme, not to enable it to make money,
not to set newsmen apart as a favored class, but to bring fulfillment to the
public's right to know. The right to know is crucial to the governing powers of
the people, to paraphrase Alexander Meiklejohn. Knowledge is essential to
informed decisions. ***
***A reporter is no better than his source of information. Unless he has a
privilege to withhold the identity of his source, he will be the victim of
governmental intrigue or aggression. If he can be summoned to testify in secret
before a grand jury, his sources will dry up and the attempted exposure, the
effort to enlighten the public, will be ended. If what the Court sanctions today
becomes settled law, then the reporter's main function in American society will
be to pass on to the public the press releases which the various departments of
government issue.***
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, WITH WHOM MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN AND MR. JUSTICE
MARSHALL JOIN, DISSENTING.
The Court's crabbed view of the First Amendment reflects a disturbing
insensitivity to the critical role of an independent press in our society. The
question whether a reporter has a constitutional right to a confidential
relationship with his source is of first impression here, but the principles that
should guide our decision are as basic as any to be found in the Constitution.
While Mr. Justice Powell's enigmatic concurring opinion gives some hope of a
more flexible view in the future, the Court in these cases holds that a newsman
Robson

209

The First Amendment

has no First Amendment right to protect his sources when called before a grand
jury. The Court thus invites state and federal authorities to undermine the
historic independence of the press by attempting to annex the journalistic
profession as an investigative arm of government. Not only will this decision
impair performance of the press' constitutionally protected functions, but it will,
I am convinced, in the long run harm rather than help the administration of
justice.
I respectfully dissent. ***
*** [W]hen a reporter is asked to appear before a grand jury and reveal
confidences, I would hold that the government must (1) show that there is
probable cause to believe that the newsman has information that is clearly
relevant to a specific probable violation of law; (2) demonstrate that the
information sought cannot be obtained by alternative means less destructive of
First Amendment rights; and (3) demonstrate a compelling and overriding
interest in the information.

MARSHALL AND SOUTER, JJ., JOINED, SOUTER, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH
MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, AND O'CONNOR, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE WHITE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The question before us is whether the First Amendment prohibits a plaintiff
from recovering damages, under state promissory estoppel law, for a
newspaper's breach of a promise of confidentiality given to the plaintiff in
exchange for information. We hold that it does not.
During the closing days of the 1982 Minnesota gubernatorial race, Dan Cohen,
an active Republican associated with Wheelock Whitney's IndependentRepublican gubernatorial campaign, approached reporters from the St. Paul
Pioneer Press Dispatch (Pioneer Press) and the Minneapolis Star and Tribune
(Star Tribune) and offered to provide documents relating to a candidate in the
upcoming election. Cohen made clear to the reporters that he would provide the
information only if he was given a promise of confidentiality. Reporters from
both papers promised to keep Cohen's identity anonymous, and Cohen turned
over copies of two public court records concerning Marlene Johnson, the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate for Lieutenant Governor. The first record
indicated that Johnson had been charged in 1969 with three counts of unlawful
assembly, and the second that she had been convicted in 1970 of petit theft.
Both newspapers interviewed Johnson for her explanation, and one reporter
tracked down the person who had found the records for Cohen. As it turned
out, the unlawful assembly charges arose out of Johnson's participation in a
protest of an alleged failure to hire minority workers on municipal construction
Robson

210

The First Amendment

projects, and the charges were eventually dismissed. The petit theft conviction
was for leaving a store without paying for $6.00 worth of sewing materials. The
incident apparently occurred at a time during which Johnson was emotionally
distraught, and the conviction was later vacated.
After consultation and debate, the editorial staffs of the two newspapers
independently decided to publish Cohen's name as part of their stories
concerning Johnson. In their stories, both papers identified Cohen as the
source of the court records, indicated his connection to the Whitney campaign,
and included denials by Whitney campaign officials of any role in the matter.
The same day the stories appeared, Cohen was fired by his employer.
Cohen sued respondents, the publishers of the Pioneer Press and Star Tribune,
in Minnesota state court, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of
contract. The trial court rejected respondents' argument that the First
Amendment barred Cohen's lawsuit. A jury returned a verdict in Cohen's favor,
awarding him $200,000 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive
damages. The Minnesota Court of Appeals, in a split decision, reversed the
award of punitive damages after concluding that Cohen had failed to establish a
fraud claim, the only claim which would support such an award. However, the
court upheld the finding of liability for breach of contract and the $200,000
compensatory damage award.
A divided Minnesota Supreme Court reversed the compensatory damages
award. After affirming the Court of Appeals' determination that Cohen had not
established a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation, the court considered his
breach of contract claim and concluded that "a contract cause of action is
inappropriate for these particular circumstances." The court then went on to
address the question whether Cohen could establish a cause of action under
Minnesota law on a promissory estoppel theory. *** In addressing the
promissory estoppel question, the court decided that the most problematic
element in establishing such a cause of action here was whether injustice could
be avoided only by enforcing the promise of confidentiality made to Cohen. The
court stated “Under a promissory estoppel analysis, there can be no neutrality
towards the First Amendment. In deciding whether it would be unjust not to
enforce the promise, the court must necessarily weigh the same considerations
that are weighed for whether the First Amendment has been violated. The court
must balance the constitutional rights of a free press against the common law
interest in protecting a promise of anonymity.” After a brief discussion, the
court concluded that “in this case, enforcement of the promise of confidentiality
under a promissory estoppel theory would violate defendants' First Amendment
rights.”
We granted certiorari to consider the First Amendment implications of this case.
There can be little doubt that the Minnesota doctrine of promissory estoppel is
a law of general applicability. It does not target or single out the press. Rather,
insofar as we are advised, the doctrine is generally applicable to the daily
transactions of all the citizens of Minnesota. The First Amendment does not
forbid its application to the press.
Respondents and amici argue that permitting Cohen to maintain a cause of
action for promissory estoppel will inhibit truthful reporting because news

Robson

211

The First Amendment

organizations will have legal incentives not to disclose a confidential source's
identity even when that person's identity is itself newsworthy. Justice Souter [in
dissent] makes a similar argument. But if this is the case, it is no more than
the incidental, and constitutionally insignificant, consequence of applying to the
press a generally applicable law that requires those who make certain kinds of
promises to keep them. Although we conclude that the First Amendment does
not confer on the press a constitutional right to disregard promises that would
otherwise be enforced under state law, we reject Cohen's request that, in
reversing the Minnesota Supreme Court's judgment, we reinstate the jury
verdict awarding him $200,000 in compensatory damages. The Minnesota
Supreme Court's incorrect conclusion that the First Amendment barred
Cohen's claim may well have truncated its consideration of whether a
promissory estoppel claim had otherwise been established under Minnesota
law, and whether Cohen's jury verdict could be upheld on a promissory
estoppel basis. Or perhaps the State Constitution may be construed to shield
the press from a promissory estoppel cause of action such as this one. These
are matters for the Minnesota Supreme Court to address and resolve in the first
instance on remand. Accordingly, the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme
Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
JUSTICE SOUTER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN AND JUSTICE
O'CONNOR JOIN, DISSENTING.
*** Because I do not believe the fact of general applicability to be dispositive, I
find it necessary to articulate, measure, and compare the competing interests
involved in any given case to determine the legitimacy of burdening
constitutional interests, and such has been the Court's recent practice in
publication cases.
Nor can I accept the majority's position that we may dispense with balancing
because the burden on publication is in a sense "self-imposed" by the
newspaper's voluntary promise of confidentiality. This suggests both the
possibility of waiver, the requirements for which have not been met here as well
as a conception of First Amendment rights as those of the speaker alone, with a
value that may be measured without reference to the importance of the
information to public discourse. But freedom of the press is ultimately founded
on the value of enhancing such discourse for the sake of a citizenry better
informed, and thus more prudently self-governed.
***The importance of this public interest is integral to the balance that should
be struck in this case. There can be no doubt that the fact of Cohen's identity
expanded the universe of information relevant to the choice faced by Minnesota
voters in that State's 1982 gubernatorial election, the publication of which was
thus of the sort quintessentially subject to strict First Amendment protection.
The propriety of his leak to respondents could be taken to reflect on his
character, which in turn could be taken to reflect on the character of the
candidate who had retained him as an adviser. An election could turn on just
such a factor; if it should, I am ready to assume that it would be to the greater
public good, at least over the long run.

Robson

212

The First Amendment

This is not to say that the breach of such a promise of confidentiality could
never give rise to liability. One can conceive of situations in which the injured
party is a private individual whose identity is of less public concern than that of
the petitioner; liability there might not be constitutionally prohibited. Nor do I
mean to imply that the circumstances of acquisition are irrelevant to the
balance although they may go only to what balances against, and not to
diminish, the First Amendment value of any particular piece of information.
Because I believe the State's interest in enforcing a newspaper's promise of
confidentiality insufficient to outweigh the interest in unfettered publication of
the information revealed in this case, I respectfully dissent.

Notes	  	  
1.
On remand in Cohen v. Cowles, the Minnesota Supreme Court
declined to provide broader protection under its state constitutional
provision than the United States Supreme Court recognized under the
First Amendment, although recognizing it was free to do so. Its reasoning
in part was based on the novelty of the issue: “The enforceability of
promises of confidentiality given a news source is an issue of first
impression, and this case presents only one variation of such promises.
The full First Amendment implications of this new issue may not yet
have surfaced.” The court upheld the award of $200,000 on the theory of
promissory estoppel. Cohen v. Cowles Media Co., 479 N.W.2d 387,
391(Minn. 1992).
2.
The meaning of Branzburg is hotly debated. In its sharply divided
opinion in United States v. Sterling, 724 F.3d 482 (4th Cir. 2013) cert.
denied sub nom. Risen v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 2696, 189 L. Ed. 2d
739 (2014), the Fourth Circuit majority held:
There is no First Amendment testimonial privilege, absolute or qualified, that
protects a reporter from being compelled to testify by the prosecution or the
defense in criminal proceedings about criminal conduct that the reporter
personally witnessed or participated in, absent a showing of bad faith,
harassment, or other such non-legitimate motive, even though the reporter
promised confidentiality to his source. In Branzburg v. Hayes (1972), the
Supreme Court “in no uncertain terms rejected the existence of such a privilege.”
In re Grand Jury Subpoena, Judith Miller, 438 F.3d 1141, 1146 (D.C.Cir.2006).

However, the dissenting judge argued:
The full import of Justice Powell's concurrence continues to be debated. Some
analogize the Branzburg majority opinion to a plurality opinion, and therefore
assert Justice Powell's concurrence as the narrowest opinion is controlling. See
In re Grand Jury Subpoena, Judith Miller, 438 F.3d 1141, 1148 (D.C.Cir.2006)
(describing appellants' argument that in a five-to-four decision, “the opinion of
the least encompassing justice [ ] determines the precedent set by the decision”).
Others, like my good friends in the majority, treat Justice Powell's concurrence
as ancillary, and simply rejoin that “the meaning of a majority opinion is to be
found within the opinion itself.”

Robson

213

The First Amendment

Given this confusion, appellate courts have subsequently hewed closer to
Justice Powell's concurrence—and Justice Stewart's dissent—than to the
majority opinion, and a number of courts have since recognized a qualified
reporter's privilege, often utilizing a three-part balancing test. See, e.g., United
States v. Caporale, 806 F.2d 1487, 1504 (11th Cir.1986) (applying the reporter's
privilege in the criminal context); United States v. Burke, 700 F.2d 70, 76–77 (2d
Cir.1983) (recognizing the qualified privilege in criminal cases); Zerilli v. Smith,
656 F.2d 705, 711–13 (D.C.Cir.1981) (applying the reporter's privilege in a civil
case). Indeed, a mere five years after Branzburg, a federal court of appeals
confidently asserted that the existence of a qualified reporter's privilege was “no
longer in doubt.” Silkwood v. Kerr–McGee Corp., 563 F.2d 433, 437 (10th
Cir.1977). In short, Justice Powell's concurrence and the subsequent appellate
history have made the lessons of Branzburg about as clear as mud.

3.
The cases involving a First Amendment reporter’s privilege also
discuss whether there is a common law right. Additionally, many states
have reporter’s shield laws. There has also long been pending legislation
in Congress to adopt a federal reporter’s shield law, see Free Flow of
Information Act, SB 987 (available at: https://www.congress.gov/
congressional-report/113th-congress/senate-report/118/1).
Do you think a statutory remedy is a good idea? Why or why not?

JUSTICE MARSHALL DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Florida Stat. § 794.03 (1987) makes it unlawful to "print, publish, or
broadcast . . . in any instrument of mass communication" the name of the
victim of a sexual offense. Pursuant to this statute, appellant The Florida Star
was found civilly liable for publishing the name of a rape victim which it had
obtained from a publicly released police report. The issue presented here is
whether this result comports with the First Amendment. We hold that it does
not.
The Florida Star is a weekly newspaper which serves the community of
Jacksonville, Florida, and which has an average circulation of approximately
18,000 copies. A regular feature of the newspaper is its "Police Reports" section.
That section, typically two to three pages in length, contains brief articles
describing local criminal incidents under police investigation.

Robson

214

The First Amendment

On October 20, 1983, appellee B. J. F. reported to the Duval County, Florida,
Sheriff's Department (Department) that she had been robbed and sexually
assaulted by an unknown assailant. The Department prepared a report on the
incident which identified B. J. F. by her full name. The Department then placed
the report in its pressroom. The Department does not restrict access either to
the pressroom or to the reports made available therein.
A Florida Star reporter-trainee sent to the pressroom copied the police report
verbatim, including B. J. F.'s full name, on a blank duplicate of the
Department's forms. A Florida Star reporter then prepared a one-paragraph
article about the crime, derived entirely from the trainee's copy of the police
report. The article included B. J. F.'s full name. It appeared in the "Robberies"
subsection of the "Police Reports" section on October 29, 1983, one of 54 police
blotter stories in that day's edition. ***
[B. J. F. filed suit against the Sheriff’s Department and The Florida Star,
alleging that these parties negligently violated § 794.03. The Department settled
with B. J. F. for $2,500. After a trial, a jury awarded B. J. F. $75,000 in
compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages against The Florida
Star. An appellate court affirmed. The Florida Star’s First Amendment
arguments during trial and on appeal were rejected.]
We *** now reverse.
The tension between the right which the First Amendment accords to a free
press, on the one hand, and the protections which various statutes and
common-law doctrines accord to personal privacy against the publication of
truthful information, on the other, is a subject we have addressed several times
in recent years. Our decisions in cases involving government attempts to
sanction the accurate dissemination of information as invasive of privacy, have
not, however, exhaustively considered this conflict. On the contrary, although
our decisions have without exception upheld the press' right to publish, we
have emphasized each time that we were resolving this conflict only as it arose
in a discrete factual context. ***
The parties to this case frame their contentions in light of a trilogy of cases
which have presented, in different contexts, the conflict between truthful
reporting and state-protected privacy interests. In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v.
Cohn (1975), we found unconstitutional a civil damages award entered against
a television station for broadcasting the name of a rape-murder victim which
the station had obtained from courthouse records. In Oklahoma Publishing Co. v.
Oklahoma County District Court (1977), we found unconstitutional a state court's
pretrial order enjoining the media from publishing the name or photograph of
an 11-year-old boy in connection with a juvenile proceeding involving that child
which reporters had attended. Finally, in Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co.
(1979), we found unconstitutional the indictment of two newspapers for
violating a state statute forbidding newspapers to publish, without written
approval of the juvenile court, the name of any youth charged as a juvenile
offender. The papers had learned about a shooting by monitoring a police band
radio frequency and had obtained the name of the alleged juvenile assailant
from witnesses, the police, and a local prosecutor.

Robson

215

The First Amendment

*** We conclude that imposing damages on appellant for publishing B. J. F.'s
name violates the First Amendment, although not for either of the reasons
appellant urges. Despite the strong resemblance this case bears to Cox
Broadcasting, that case cannot fairly be read as controlling here. The name of
the rape victim in that case was obtained from courthouse records that were
open to public inspection, a fact which Justice White's opinion for the Court
repeatedly noted. Significantly, one of the reasons we gave in Cox Broadcasting
for invalidating the challenged damages award was the important role the press
plays in subjecting trials to public scrutiny and thereby helping guarantee their
fairness. That role is not directly compromised where, as here, the information
in question comes from a police report prepared and disseminated at a time at
which not only had no adversarial criminal proceedings begun, but no suspect
had been identified.
Nor need we accept appellant's invitation to hold broadly that truthful
publication may never be punished consistent with the First Amendment. Our
cases have carefully eschewed reaching this ultimate question, mindful that the
future may bring scenarios which prudence counsels our not resolving
anticipatorily. *** Respecting the fact that press freedom and privacy rights are
both "plainly rooted in the traditions and significant concerns of our society,"
we instead focused on the less sweeping issue "whether the State may impose
sanctions on the accurate publication of the name of a rape victim obtained
from public records — more specifically, from judicial records which are
maintained in connection with a public prosecution and which themselves are
open to public inspection." We continue to believe that the sensitivity and
significance of the interests presented in clashes between First Amendment and
privacy rights counsel relying on limited principles that sweep no more broadly
than the appropriate context of the instant case. ***
Our holding today is limited. We do not hold that truthful publication is
automatically constitutionally protected, or that there is no zone of personal
privacy within which the State may protect the individual from intrusion by the
press, or even that a State may never punish publication of the name of a
victim of a sexual offense. We hold only that where a newspaper publishes
truthful information which it has lawfully obtained, punishment may lawfully
be imposed, if at all, only when narrowly tailored to a state interest of the
highest order, and that no such interest is satisfactorily served by imposing
liability under § 794.03 to appellant under the facts of this case. The decision
below is therefore
Reversed.
JUSTICE SCALIA, CONCURRING IN PART AND CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT [OMITTED]
JUSTICE WHITE, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND JUSTICE O'CONNOR JOIN,
DISSENTING.
"Short of homicide, [rape] is the `ultimate violation of self.'" For B. J. F., however,
the violation she suffered at a rapist's knifepoint marked only the beginning of
her ordeal. A week later, while her assailant was still at large, an account of this
assault — identifying by name B. J. F. as the victim — was published by The
Florida Star. As a result, B. J. F. received harassing phone calls, required
mental health counseling, was forced to move from her home, and was even

Robson

216

The First Amendment

threatened with being raped again. Yet today, the Court holds that a jury award
of $75,000 to compensate B. J. F. for the harm she suffered due to the Star's
negligence is at odds with the First Amendment. I do not accept this result. ***
At issue in this case is whether there is any information about people, which —
thought true — may not be published in the press. By holding that only "a state
interest of the highest order" permits the State to penalize the publication of
truthful information, and by holding that protecting a rape victim's right to
privacy is not among those state interests of the highest order, the Court
accepts appellant's invitation to obliterate one of the most noteworthy legal
inventions of the 20th century: the tort of the publication of private facts. Even
if the Court's opinion does not say as much today, such obliteration will follow
inevitably from the Court's conclusion here. If the First Amendment prohibits
wholly private persons (such as B. J. F.) from recovering for the publication of
the fact that she was raped, I doubt that there remain any "private facts" which
persons may assume will not be published in the newspapers or broadcast on
television.
Of course, the right to privacy is not absolute. Even the article widely relied
upon in cases vindicating privacy rights, Warren Brandeis, The Right to Privacy,
4 HARV. L. REV. 193 (1890), recognized that this right inevitably conflicts with
the public's right to know about matters of general concern — and that
sometimes, the latter must trump the former. Resolving this conflict is a
difficult matter, and I fault the Court not for attempting to strike an appropriate
balance between the two, but rather, fault it for according too little weight to B.
J. F.'s side of equation, and too much on the other. ***
Ironically, this Court, too, had occasion to consider this same balance just a few
weeks ago, in United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for
Freedom of Press (1989). There, we were faced with a press request, under the
Freedom of Information Act, for a "rap sheet" on a person accused of bribing a
Congressman — presumably, a person whose privacy rights would be far less
than B. J. F.'s. Yet this Court rejected the media's request for disclosure of the
"rap sheet," *** [concluding] that disclosure of rap sheets "categorical[ly]"
constitutes an "unwarranted" invasion of privacy. The same surely must be
true — indeed, much more so — for the disclosure of a rape victim's name.
I do not suggest that the Court's decision today is a radical departure from a
previously charted course. The Court's ruling has been foreshadowed. In Time,
Inc. v. Hill (1967), we observed that — after a brief period early in this century
where Brandeis' view was ascendant — the trend in "modern" jurisprudence
has been to eclipse an individual's right to maintain private any truthful
information that the press wished to publish. More recently, in Cox
Broadcasting, we acknowledged the possibility that the First Amendment may
prevent a State from ever subjecting the publication of truthful but private
information to civil liability. Today, we hit the bottom of the slippery slope.
I would find a place to draw the line higher on the hillside: a spot high enough
to protect B. J. F.'s desire for privacy and peace-of-mind in the wake of a
horrible personal tragedy. There is no public interest in publishing the names,
addresses, and phone numbers of persons who are the victims of crime — and
no public interest in immunizing the press from liability in the rare cases where

FILED A CONCURRING OPINION IN WHICH REHNQUIST, J., JOINED. WHITE, J., FILED A CONCURRING
OPINION.

BURGER, C.J., FOR THE COURT.
The issue in this case is whether a state statute granting a political candidate a
right to equal space to reply to criticism and attacks on his record by a
newspaper violates the guarantees of a free press.
I
In the fall of 1972, appellee, Executive Director of the Classroom Teachers
Association, apparently a teachers' collective-bargaining agent, was a candidate
for the Florida House of Representatives. On September 20, 1972, and again on
September 29, 1972, appellant printed editorials critical of appellee's candidacy.
In response to these editorials appellee demanded that appellant print verbatim
his replies, defending the role of the Classroom Teachers Association and the
organization's accomplishments for the citizens of Dade County. Appellant
declined to print the appellee's replies, and appellee brought suit in Circuit
Court, Dade County, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and actual and
punitive damages in excess of $5,000. The action was premised on Florida
Statute §104.38 (1973), a "right of reply" statute which provides that if a
candidate for nomination or election is assailed regarding his personal
character or official record by any newspaper, the candidate has the right to
demand that the newspaper print, free of cost to the candidate, any reply the
candidate may make to the newspaper's charges. The reply must appear in as
conspicuous a place and in the same kind of type as the charges which
prompted the reply, provided it does not take up more space than the charges.
Failure to comply with the statute constitutes a first-degree misdemeanor.
Appellant sought a declaration that §104.38 was unconstitutional. After an
emergency hearing requested by appellee, the Circuit Court denied injunctive
relief because, absent special circumstances, no injunction could properly issue
against the commission of a crime, and held that 104.38 was unconstitutional
as an infringement on the freedom of the press under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments to the Constitution. The Circuit Court concluded that dictating
what a newspaper must print was no different from dictating what it must not
print. The Circuit Judge viewed the statute's vagueness as serving "to restrict
and stifle protected expression." Appellee's cause was dismissed with prejudice.
On direct appeal, the Florida Supreme Court reversed, holding that 104.38 did
not violate constitutional guarantees. It held that free speech was enhanced and
not abridged by the Florida right-of-reply statute, which in that court's view,

Robson

218

The First Amendment

furthered the "broad societal interest in the free flow of information to the
public." It also held that the statute is not impermissibly vague; the statute
informs "those who are subject to it as to what conduct on their part will render
them liable to its penalties." Civil remedies, including damages, were held to be
available under this statute; the case was remanded to the trial court for
further proceedings not inconsistent with the Florida Supreme Court's opinion.
We postponed consideration of the question of jurisdiction to the hearing of the
case on the merits.

A
The challenged statute creates a right to reply to press criticism of a candidate
for nomination or election. The statute was enacted in 1913, and this is only
the second recorded case decided under its provisions.
Appellant contends the statute is void on its face because it purports to regulate
the content of a newspaper in violation of the First Amendment. Alternatively it
is urged that the statute is void for vagueness since no editor could know
exactly what words would call the statute into operation. It is also contended
that the statute fails to distinguish between critical comment which is and
which is not defamatory.
B
The appellee and supporting advocates of an enforceable right of access to the
press vigorously argue that government has an obligation to ensure that a wide
variety of views reach the public. The contentions of access proponents will be
set out in some detail. It is urged that at the time the First Amendment to the
Constitution was ratified in 1791 as part of our Bill of Rights the press was
broadly representative of the people it was serving. While many of the
newspapers were intensely partisan and narrow in their views, the press
collectively presented a broad range of opinions to readers. Entry into
publishing was inexpensive; pamphlets and books provided meaningful
alternatives to the organized press for the expression of unpopular ideas and
often treated events and expressed views not covered by conventional
newspapers. A true marketplace of ideas existed in which there was relatively
easy access to the channels of communication.
Access advocates submit that although newspapers of the present are
superficially similar to those of 1791 the press of today is in reality very
different from that known in the early years of our national existence. In the
past half century a communications revolution has seen the introduction of
radio and television into our lives, the promise of a global community through
the use of communications satellites, and the specter of a "wired" nation by
means of an expanding cable television network with two-way capabilities. The
printed press, it is said, has not escaped the effects of this revolution.
Newspapers have become big business and there are far fewer of them to serve
a larger literate population. Chains of newspapers, national newspapers,

Robson

219

The First Amendment

national wire and news services, and one-newspaper towns, are the dominant
features of a press that has become noncompetitive and enormously powerful
and influential in its capacity to manipulate popular opinion and change the
course of events. Major metropolitan newspapers have collaborated to establish
news services national in scope. Such national news organizations provide
syndicated "interpretive reporting" as well as syndicated features and
commentary, all of which can serve as part of the new school of "advocacy
journalism."
The elimination of competing newspapers in most of our large cities, and the
concentration of control of media that results from the only newspaper's being
owned by the same interests which own a television station and a radio station,
are important components of this trend toward concentration of control of
outlets to inform the public.
The result of these vast changes has been to place in a few hands the power to
inform the American people and shape public opinion. Much of the editorial
opinion and commentary that is printed is that of syndicated columnists
distributed nationwide and, as a result, we are told, on national and world
issues there tends to be a homogeneity of editorial opinion, commentary, and
interpretive analysis. The abuses of bias and manipulative reportage are,
likewise, said to be the result of the vast accumulations of unreviewable power
in the modern media empires. In effect, it is claimed, the public has lost any
ability to respond or to contribute in a meaningful way to the debate on issues.
The monopoly of the means of communication allows for little or no critical
analysis of the media except in professional journals of very limited readership.
***
The obvious solution, which was available to dissidents at an earlier time when
entry into publishing was relatively inexpensive, today would be to have
additional newspapers. But the same economic factors which have caused the
disappearance of vast numbers of metropolitan newspapers, have made entry
into the marketplace of ideas served by the print media almost impossible. It is
urged that the claim of newspapers to be "surrogates for the public" carries with
it a concomitant fiduciary obligation to account for that stewardship. From this
premise it is reasoned that the only effective way to insure fairness and
accuracy and to provide for some accountability is for government to take
affirmative action. The First Amendment interest of the public in being informed
is said to be in peril because the "marketplace of ideas" is today a monopoly
controlled by the owners of the market.
Proponents of enforced access to the press take comfort from language in
several of this Court's decisions which suggests that the First Amendment acts
as a sword as well as a shield, that it imposes obligations on the owners of the
press in addition to protecting the press from government regulation. ***
IV
However much validity may be found in these arguments, at each point the
implementation of a remedy such as an enforceable right of access necessarily
calls for some mechanism, either governmental or consensual. If it is
governmental coercion, this at once brings about a confrontation with the

Robson

220

The First Amendment

express provisions of the First Amendment and the judicial gloss on that
Amendment developed over the years. ***
We see that *** the Court has expressed sensitivity as to whether a restriction
or requirement constituted the compulsion exerted by government on a
newspaper to print that which it would not otherwise print. The clear
implication has been that any such a compulsion to publish that which
"`reason' tells them should not be published" is unconstitutional. A responsible
press is an undoubtedly desirable goal, but press responsibility is not
mandated by the Constitution and like many other virtues it cannot be
legislated.
Appellee's argument that the Florida statute does not amount to a restriction of
appellant's right to speak because "the statute in question here has not
prevented the Miami Herald from saying anything it wished" begs the core
question. Compelling editors or publishers to publish that which "`reason' tells
them should not be published" is what is at issue in this case. The Florida
statute operates as a command in the same sense as a statute or regulation
forbidding appellant to publish specified matter. Governmental restraint on
publishing need not fall into familiar or traditional patterns to be subject to
constitutional limitations on governmental powers. The Florida statute exacts a
penalty on the basis of the content of a newspaper. The first phase of the
penalty resulting from the compelled printing of a reply is exacted in terms of
the cost in printing and composing time and materials and in taking up space
that could be devoted to other material the newspaper may have preferred to
print. It is correct, as appellee contends, that a newspaper is not subject to the
finite technological limitations of time that confront a broadcaster but it is not
correct to say that, as an economic reality, a newspaper can proceed to infinite
expansion of its column space to accommodate the replies that a government
agency determines or a statute commands the readers should have available.
Faced with the penalties that would accrue to any newspaper that published
news or commentary arguably within the reach of the right-of-access statute,
editors might well conclude that the safe course is to avoid controversy.
Therefore, under the operation of the Florida statute, political and electoral
coverage would be blunted or reduced. Government-enforced right of access
inescapably "dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate," New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). ***
Even if a newspaper would face no additional costs to comply with a
compulsory access law and would not be forced to forgo publication of news or
opinion by the inclusion of a reply, the Florida statute fails to clear the barriers
of the First Amendment because of its intrusion into the function of editors. A
newspaper is more than a passive receptacle or conduit for news, comment,
and advertising. The choice of material to go into a newspaper, and the
decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and
treatment of public issues and public officials - whether fair or unfair constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment. It has yet to be
demonstrated how governmental regulation of this crucial process can be
exercised consistent with First Amendment guarantees of a free press as they
have evolved to this time. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Florida is reversed.

I join the Court's opinion which, as I understand it, addresses only "right of

Notes	  	  
1.
How have the concerns raised in B.J.F. and Tornillo been altered by
the change in media landscape in the “information age” of the internet?
2.
Consider the First Amendment arguments against so-called
“paparazzi” laws meant to limit members of the press from invading the
privacy of celebrities.
For example, California Vehicle Code § 40008 entitled “Intent to capture
image, recording or impression for a commercial purpose,” passed in
2011, provides in part:
a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except as otherwise provided in
subdivision (c) [providing for multiple penalties], any person who violates Section
21701[Interference with driver or mechanism] 21703 [Following too closely], or
23103[Reckless driving] with the intent to capture any type of visual image,
sound recording, or other physical impression of another person for a
commercial purpose, is guilty of a misdemeanor and not an infraction and shall
be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than six months and
by a fine of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).

In 2014, California Civil Code §1708.8 was amended to provide:
(a) A person is liable for physical invasion of privacy when the defendant
knowingly enters onto the land of another person without permission or
otherwise committed a trespass in order to capture any type of visual image,
sound recording, or other physical impression of the plaintiff engaging in a
private, personal, or familial activity and the invasion occurs in a manner that is
offensive to a reasonable person.
(b) A person is liable for constructive invasion of privacy when the defendant
attempts to capture, in a manner that is offensive to a reasonable person, any
type of visual image, sound recording, or other physical impression of the
plaintiff engaging in a private, personal, or familial activity, through the use of a
visual or auditory enhancing device, regardless of whether there is a physical
trespass, if this image, sound recording, or other physical impression could not
have been achieved without a trespass unless the visual or auditory enhancing
device was used.

Do you think such laws would be upheld as constitutional?

The First Amendment

Note:	  Taxation	  of	  the	  Press	  	  
Taxing the press, especially as a means of regulation, restraint, and
control of speech rather than the raising of revenue, has roots in English
Acts, and was arguably disfavored by the framers of the First
Amendment.
The general key in these cases is not that the press or media is subject to
tax, but that this tax is somehow discriminatory or aimed at their speech.
The United States Supreme Court’s most famous press-taxing case is
Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 US 233 (1936), in which a
unanimous Court held unconstitutional a Louisiana statute taxing at 2%
of gross receipts all publications with a circulation of over 20,000 copies
per week. While the Court discussed the history of taxing the press and
waxed eloquent on press freedom - - - and some of this language is
quoted in subsequent cases - - - the Court found the form of the tax
“suspicious.” What is not apparent from the published opinion, but is
well-documented in the briefs and other discussions of the case, is that
the tax was passed with the encouragement of Governor Huey Long,
known as the “Kingfisher,” and that the larger media outlets in the state
who were being subject to the tax were opposed to the Governor.
In Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Com'r of Revenue, 460 U.S.
575 (1983), the Court held unconstitutional a “use tax” on the cost of
paper and ink products consumed in the production of such a
publication, exempting the first $100,000 worth of paper and ink
consumed in any calendar year. Although there was no indication of a
bad motive as in Grosjean, Minnesota’s singling out the press for special
treatment, with a tax that was not structured similar to any other state
tax, suggested that the goal of the tax is not unrelated to suppression of
expression, and such goal is presumptively unconstitutional.
In Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 22 (1987), the
Court held unconstitutional a tax scheme that taxed general interest
magazines, but exempted newspapers and religious, professional, trade,
and sports journals. Again, there was no Grosjean bad motive, but the
Court applied strict scrutiny finding there was content discrimination.
However, in Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S. 439 (1991), the Court upheld
the Arkansas taxing scheme that exempted print media from sales tax
but did not exempt cable television. The Court held that although cable
television, which provides news, information, and entertainment to its
subscribers, is engaged in “speech” and is part of the “press” in much of
its operation, the fact that it is taxed differently from other media does
not by itself raise First Amendment concerns. Here, the Court found it
important that there was no evidence of censorious intent and there was
Robson

223

The First Amendment

no discrimination based on content; discrimination based on speakers,
without more, did not merit strict scrutiny.

The “constitutionalization” of defamation and other torts is often viewed
as integral to not abridging freedom of the press. Consider how First

BRENNAN J., FOR THE UNANIMOUS COURT. BLACK, J., ISSUED A CONCURRING OPINION JOINED BY
DOUGLAS, J. GOLDBERG, J., ISSUED A CONCURRING OPINION JOINED BY DOUGLAS, J.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
We are required in this case to determine for the first time the extent to which
the constitutional protections for speech and press limit a State's power to
award damages in a libel action brought by a public official against critics of his
official conduct.
Respondent L. B. Sullivan is one of the three elected Commissioners of the City
of Montgomery, Alabama. He testified that he was "Commissioner of Public
Affairs and the duties are supervision of the Police Department, Fire
Department, Department of Cemetery and Department of Scales." He brought
this civil libel action against the four individual petitioners, who are Negroes
and Alabama clergymen, and against petitioner the New York Times Company,
a New York corporation which publishes the New York Times, a daily
newspaper. A jury in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County awarded him
damages of $500,000, the full amount claimed, against all the petitioners, and
the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed.
Respondent's complaint alleged that he had been libeled by statements in a fullpage advertisement that was carried in the New York Times on March 29, 1960.
Entitled "Heed Their Rising Voices," the advertisement began by stating that "As
the whole world knows by now, thousands of Southern Negro students are
engaged in widespread non-violent demonstrations in positive affirmation of the
right to live in human dignity as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the
Bill of Rights." It went on to charge that "in their efforts to uphold these
guarantees, they are being met by an unprecedented wave of terror by those

Robson

224

The First Amendment

who would deny and negate that document which the whole world looks upon
as setting the pattern for modern freedom. . . ." Succeeding paragraphs
purported to illustrate the "wave of terror" by describing certain alleged events.
The text concluded with an appeal for funds for three purposes: support of the
student movement, "the struggle for the right-to-vote," and the legal defense of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., leader of the movement, against a perjury
indictment then pending in Montgomery.
The text appeared over the names of 64 persons, many widely known for their
activities in public affairs, religion, trade unions, and the performing arts.
Below these names, and under a line reading "We in the south who are
struggling daily for dignity and freedom warmly endorse this appeal," appeared
the names of the four individual petitioners and of 16 other persons, all but two
of whom were identified as clergymen in various Southern cities. The
advertisement was signed at the bottom of the page by the "Committee to
Defend Martin Luther King and the Struggle for Freedom in the South," and the
officers of the Committee were listed.
Of the 10 paragraphs of text in the advertisement, the third and a portion of the
sixth were the basis of respondent's claim of libel. They read as follows:
Third paragraph:
"In Montgomery, Alabama, after students sang `My Country, 'Tis of Thee' on the
State Capitol steps, their leaders were expelled from school, and truckloads of
police armed with shotguns and tear-gas ringed the Alabama State College
Campus. When the entire student body protested to state authorities by refusing
to re-register, their dining hall was padlocked in an attempt to starve them into
submission."

Sixth paragraph:
"Again and again the Southern violators have answered Dr. King's peaceful
protests with intimidation and violence. They have bombed his home almost
killing his wife and child. They have assaulted his person. They have arrested
him seven times - for `speeding,' `loitering' and similar `offenses.' And now they
have charged him with `perjury' - a felony under which they could imprison him
for ten years. . . ."

Although neither of these statements mentions respondent by name, he
contended that the word "police" in the third paragraph referred to him as the
Montgomery Commissioner who supervised the Police Department, so that he
was being accused of "ringing" the campus with police. He further claimed that
the paragraph would be read as imputing to the police, and hence to him, the
padlocking of the dining hall in order to starve the students into submission. 2
As to the sixth paragraph, he contended that since arrests are ordinarily made
by the police, the statement "They have arrested [Dr. King] seven times" would
be read as referring to him; he further contended that the "They" who did the
arresting would be equated with the "They" who committed the other described
acts and with the "Southern violators." Thus, he argued, the paragraph would

Robson

225

The First Amendment

be read as accusing the Montgomery police, and hence him, of answering Dr.
King's protests with "intimidation and violence," bombing his home, assaulting
his person, and charging him with perjury. Respondent and six other
Montgomery residents testified that they read some or all of the statements as
referring to him in his capacity as Commissioner.
It is uncontroverted that some of the statements contained in the paragraphs
were not accurate descriptions of events which occurred in Montgomery.
Although Negro students staged a demonstration on the State Capitol steps,
they sang the National Anthem and not "My Country, 'Tis of Thee." Although
nine students were expelled by the State Board of Education, this was not for
leading the demonstration at the Capitol, but for demanding service at a lunch
counter in the Montgomery County Courthouse on another day. Not the entire
student body, but most of it, had protested the expulsion, not by refusing to
register, but by boycotting classes on a single day; virtually all the students did
register for the ensuing semester. The campus dining hall was not padlocked on
any occasion, and the only students who may have been barred from eating
there were the few who had neither signed a preregistration application nor
requested temporary meal tickets. Although the police were deployed near the
campus in large numbers on three occasions, they did not at any time "ring" the
campus, and they were not called to the campus in connection with the
demonstration on the State Capitol steps, as the third paragraph implied. Dr.
King had not been arrested seven times, but only four; and although he claimed
to have been assaulted some years earlier in connection with his arrest for
loitering outside a courtroom, one of the officers who made the arrest denied
that there was such an assault.
On the premise that the charges in the sixth paragraph could be read as
referring to him, respondent was allowed to prove that he had not participated
in the events described. Although Dr. King's home had in fact been bombed
twice when his wife and child were there, both of these occasions antedated
respondent's tenure as Commissioner, and the police were not only not
implicated in the bombings, but had made every effort to apprehend those who
were. Three of Dr. King's four arrests took place before respondent became
Commissioner. Although Dr. King had in fact been indicted (he was
subsequently acquitted) on two counts of perjury, each of which carried a
possible five-year sentence, respondent had nothing to do with procuring the
indictment.
Respondent made no effort to prove that he suffered actual pecuniary loss as a
result of the alleged libel. *** The trial judge submitted the case to the jury
under instructions that the statements in the advertisement were "libelous per
se" and were not privileged, so that petitioners might be held liable if the jury
found that they had published the advertisement and that the statements were
made "of and concerning" respondent. The jury was instructed that, because
the statements were libelous per se, "the law . . . implies legal injury from the
bare fact of publication itself," "falsity and malice are presumed," "general
damages need not be alleged or proved but are presumed," and "punitive
damages may be awarded by the jury even though the amount of actual

Robson

226

The First Amendment

damages is neither found nor shown." An award of punitive damages - as
distinguished from "general" damages, which are compensatory in nature apparently requires proof of actual malice under Alabama law, and the judge
charged that "mere negligence or carelessness is not evidence of actual malice
or malice in fact, and does not justify an award of exemplary or punitive
damages." He refused to charge, however, that the jury must be "convinced" of
malice, in the sense of "actual intent" to harm or "gross negligence and
recklessness," to make such an award, and he also refused to require that a
verdict for respondent differentiate between compensatory and punitive
damages. The judge rejected petitioners' contention that his rulings abridged
the freedoms of speech and of the press that are guaranteed by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments.
[The jury found for the plaintiff and the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed].
Because of the importance of the constitutional issues involved, we granted the
separate petitions for certiorari of the individual petitioners and of the Times.
We reverse the judgment. We hold that the rule of law applied by the Alabama
courts is constitutionally deficient for failure to provide the safeguards for
freedom of speech and of the press that are required by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments in a libel action brought by a public official against
critics of his official conduct. We further hold that under the proper safeguards
the evidence presented in this case is constitutionally insufficient to support the
judgment for respondent.
[The Court first held that there was state action and that the publication was
not a "commercial" advertisement unprotected by the First Amendment because
it “communicated information, expressed opinion, recited grievances, protested
claimed abuses, and sought financial support on behalf of a movement whose
existence and objectives are matters of the highest public interest and
concern.”]
Under Alabama law as applied in this case, a publication is "libelous per se" if
the words "tend to injure a person . . . in his reputation" or to "bring [him] into
public contempt.” *** Once "libel per se" has been established, the defendant
has no defense as to stated facts unless he can persuade the jury that they
were true in all their particulars. ***
The question before us is whether this rule of liability, as applied to an action
brought by a public official against critics of his official conduct, abridges the
freedom of speech and of the press that is guaranteed by the first and
Fourteenth Amendments. ***In deciding the question now, we are compelled by
neither precedent nor policy to give any more weight to the epithet "libel" than
we have to other "mere labels" of state law. Like insurrection, contempt,
advocacy of unlawful acts, breach of the peace, obscenity, solicitation of legal
business, and the various other formulae for the repression of expression that
have been challenged in this court, libel can claim no talismanic immunity from
constitutional limitations. It must be measured by standards that satisfy the
First Amendment.

Robson

227

The First Amendment

The general proposition that freedom of expression upon public questions is
secured by the First Amendment has long been settled by our decisions. ***
Thus we consider this case against the background of a profound national
commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be
uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement,
caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public
officials. The present advertisement, as an expression of grievance and protest
on one of the major public issues of our time, would seem clearly to qualify for
the constitutional protection. The question is whether it forfeits that protection
by the falsity of some of its factual statements and by its alleged defamation of
respondent.
Authoritative interpretations of the First Amendment guarantees have
consistently refused to recognize an exception for any test of truth - whether
administered by judges, juries, or administrative officials - and especially one
that puts the burden of proving truth on the speaker. The constitutional
protection does not turn upon "the truth, popularity, or social utility of the
ideas and beliefs which are offered." As Madison said, "Some degree of abuse is
inseparable from the proper use of every thing; and in no instance is this more
true than in that of the press." ***
[E]rroneous statement is inevitable in free debate, and ***must be protected if
the freedoms of expression are to have the "breathing space" that they "need . . .
to survive."
Injury to official reputation affords no more warrant for repressing speech that
would otherwise be free than does factual error. Where judicial officers are
involved, this Court has held that concern for the dignity and reputation of the
courts does not justify the punishment as criminal contempt of criticism of the
judge or his decision. This is true even though the utterance contains "halftruths" and "misinformation." Such repression can be justified, if at all, only by
a clear and present danger of the obstruction of justice. If judges are to be
treated as "men of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate," surely the same
must be true of other government officials, such as elected city commissioners.
Criticism of their official conduct does not lose its constitutional protection
merely because it is effective criticism and hence diminishes their official
reputations.
If neither factual error nor defamatory content suffices to remove the
constitutional shield from criticism of official conduct, the combination of the
two elements is no less inadequate. This is the lesson to be drawn from the
great controversy over the Sedition Act of 1798 which first crystallized a
national awareness of the central meaning of the First Amendment. That
statute made it a crime, punishable by a $5,000 fine and five years in prison, "if
any person shall write, print, utter or publish . . . any false, scandalous and
malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States, or
either house of the Congress. . ., or the President . . ., with intent to defame . . .
or to bring them, or either of them, into contempt or disrepute; or to excite

Robson

228

The First Amendment

against them, or either or any of them, the hatred of the good people of the
United States." The Act allowed the defendant the defense of truth, and
provided that the jury were to be judges both of the law and the facts. Despite
these qualifications, the Act was vigorously condemned as unconstitutional in
an attack joined in by Jefferson and Madison. ***
Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court, the attack upon its
validity has carried the day in the court of history. *** [There is] a broad
consensus that the Act, because of the restraint it imposed upon criticism of
government and public officials, was inconsistent with the First Amendment. ***
There is no force in respondent's argument that the constitutional limitations
implicit in the history of the Sedition Act apply only to Congress and not to the
States. *** [T]his distinction was eliminated with the adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment and the application to the States of the First Amendment's
restrictions.
What a State may not constitutionally bring about by means of a criminal
statute is likewise beyond the reach of its civil law of libel. The fear of damage
awards under a rule such as that invoked by the Alabama courts here may be
markedly more inhibiting than the fear of prosecution under a criminal statute.
*** The judgment awarded in this case - without the need for any proof of actual
pecuniary loss - was one thousand times greater than the maximum fine
provided by the Alabama criminal statute, and one hundred times greater than
that provided by the Sedition Act. And since there is no double-jeopardy
limitation applicable to civil lawsuits, this is not the only judgment that may be
awarded against petitioners for the same publication. Whether or not a
newspaper can survive a succession of such judgments, the pall of fear and
timidity imposed upon those who would give voice to public criticism is an
atmosphere in which the First Amendment freedoms cannot survive. Plainly the
Alabama law of civil libel is "a form of regulation that creates hazards to
protected freedoms markedly greater than those that attend reliance upon the
criminal law."
The state rule of law is not saved by its allowance of the defense of truth. ***
A rule compelling the critic of official conduct to guarantee the truth of all his
factual assertions - and to do so on pain of libel judgments virtually unlimited
in amount - leads to a comparable "self-censorship." Allowance of the defense of
truth, with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not mean that only
false speech will be deterred. Even courts accepting this defense as an
adequate safeguard have recognized the difficulties of adducing legal proofs that
the alleged libel was true in all its factual particulars. Under such a rule,
would-be critics of official conduct may be deterred from voicing their criticism,
even though it is believed to be true and even though it is in fact true, because
of doubt whether it can be proved in court or fear of the expense of having to do
so. They tend to make only statements which "steer far wider of the unlawful
zone." The rule thus dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate.
It is inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

Robson

229

The First Amendment

The constitutional guarantees require, we think, a federal rule that prohibits a
public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to
his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with "actual
malice" - that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of
whether it was false or not. ***
Such a privilege for criticism of official conduct is appropriately analogous to
the protection accorded a public official when he is sued for libel by a private
citizen. *** Analogous considerations support the privilege for the citizen-critic
of government. It is as much his duty to criticize as it is the official's duty to
administer. *** We conclude that such a privilege is required by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments.
We hold today that the Constitution delimits a State's power to award damages
for libel in actions brought by public officials against critics of their official
conduct. Since this is such an action, the rule requiring proof of actual malice
is applicable. While Alabama law apparently requires proof of actual malice for
an award of punitive damages, where general damages are concerned malice is
"presumed." Such a presumption is inconsistent with the federal rule.*** Since
the trial judge did not instruct the jury to differentiate between general and
punitive damages, it may be that the verdict was wholly an award of one or the
other. But it is impossible to know, in view of the general verdict returned.
Because of this uncertainty, the judgment must be reversed and the case
remanded.
Since respondent may seek a new trial, we deem that considerations of effective
judicial administration require us to review the evidence in the present record
to determine whether it could constitutionally support a judgment for
respondent. This Court's duty is not limited to the elaboration of constitutional
principles; we must also in proper cases review the evidence to make certain
that those principles have been constitutionally applied. This is such a case,
particularly since the question is one of alleged trespass across "the line
between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately
be regulated." In cases where that line must be drawn, the rule is that we
"examine for ourselves the statements in issue and the circumstances under
which they were made to see . . . whether they are of a character which the
principles of the First Amendment, as adopted by the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, protect." We must "make an independent examination
of the whole record," so as to assure ourselves that the judgment does not
constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.
Applying these standards, we consider that the proof presented to show actual
malice lacks the convincing clarity which the constitutional standard demands,
and hence that it would not constitutionally sustain the judgment for
respondent under the proper rule of law. *** [T]here is evidence that the Times
published the advertisement without checking its accuracy against the news
stories in the Times' own files. The mere presence of the stories in the files does
not, of course, establish that the Times "knew" the advertisement was false,
since the state of mind required for actual malice would have to be brought

Robson

230

The First Amendment

home to the persons in the Times' organization having responsibility for the
publication of the advertisement. With respect to the failure of those persons to
make the check, the record shows that they relied upon their knowledge of the
good reputation of many of those whose names were listed as sponsors of the
advertisement, and upon the letter from A. Philip Randolph, known to them as
a responsible individual, certifying that the use of the names was authorized.
There was testimony that the persons handling the advertisement saw nothing
in it that would render it unacceptable under the Times' policy of rejecting
advertisements containing "attacks of a personal character"; their failure to
reject it on this ground was not unreasonable. We think the evidence against
the Times supports at most a finding of negligence in failing to discover the
misstatements, and is constitutionally insufficient to show the recklessness
that is required for a finding of actual malice.
We also think the evidence was constitutionally defective in another respect: it
was incapable of supporting the jury's finding that the allegedly libelous
statements were made "of and concerning" respondent. *** There was no
reference to respondent in the advertisement, either by name or official position.
A number of the allegedly libelous statements - the charges that the dining hall
was padlocked and that Dr. King's home was bombed, his person assaulted,
and a perjury prosecution instituted against him - did not even concern the
police; despite the ingenuity of the arguments which would attach this
significance to the word "They," it is plain that these statements could not
reasonably be read as accusing respondent of personal involvement in the acts
in question. The statements upon which respondent principally relies as
referring to him are the two allegations that did concern the police or police
functions: that "truckloads of police . . . ringed the Alabama State College
Campus" after the demonstration on the State Capitol steps, and that Dr. King
had been "arrested . . . seven times." These statements were false only in that
the police had been "deployed near" the campus but had not actually "ringed" it
and had not gone there in connection with the State Capitol demonstration, and
in that Dr. King had been arrested only four times. The ruling that these
discrepancies between what was true and what was asserted were sufficient to
injure respondent's reputation may itself raise constitutional problems, but we
need not consider them here. Although the statements may be taken as
referring to the police, they did not on their face make even an oblique reference
to respondent as an individual. Support for the asserted reference must,
therefore, be sought in the testimony of respondent's witnesses. But none of
them suggested any basis for the belief that respondent himself was attacked in
the advertisement beyond the bare fact that he was in overall charge of the
Police Department and thus bore official responsibility for police conduct; to the
extent that some of the witnesses thought respondent to have been charged
with ordering or approving the conduct or otherwise being personally involved
in it, they based this notion not on any statements in the advertisement, and
not on any evidence that he had in fact been so involved, but solely on the
unsupported assumption that, because of his official position, he must have
been. *** Raising as it does the possibility that a good-faith critic of government
will be penalized for his criticism, the proposition relied on by the Alabama
courts strikes at the very center of the constitutionally protected area of free
expression. We hold that such a proposition may not constitutionally be utilized

Robson

231

The First Amendment

to establish that an otherwise impersonal attack on governmental operations
was a libel of an official responsible for those operations. Since it was relied on
exclusively here, and there was no other evidence to connect the statements
with respondent, the evidence was constitutionally insufficient to support a
finding that the statements referred to respondent.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is reversed and the case is
remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK, WITH WHOM MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS JOINS, CONCURRING.
I concur in reversing this half-million-dollar judgment against the New York
Times Company and the four individual defendants. In reversing the Court
holds that "the Constitution delimits a State's power to award damages for libel
in actions brought by public officials against critics of their official conduct." I
base my vote to reverse on the belief that the First and Fourteenth Amendments
not merely "delimit" a State's power to award damages to "public officials
against critics of their official conduct" but completely prohibit a State from
exercising such a power. The Court goes on to hold that a State can subject
such critics to damages if "actual malice" can be proved against them. "Malice,"
even as defined by the Court, is an elusive, abstract concept, hard to prove and
hard to disprove. The requirement that malice be proved provides at best an
evanescent protection for the right critically to discuss public affairs and
certainly does not measure up to the sturdy safeguard embodied in the First
Amendment. Unlike the Court, therefore, I vote to reverse exclusively on the
ground that the Times and the individual defendants had an absolute,
unconditional constitutional right to publish in the Times advertisement their
criticisms of the Montgomery agencies and officials. ***
We would, I think, more faithfully interpret the First Amendment by holding
that at the very least it leaves the people and the press free to criticize officials
and discuss public affairs with impunity. This Nation of ours elects many of its
important officials; so do the States, the municipalities, the counties, and even
many precincts. These officials are responsible to the people for the way they
perform their duties. While our Court has held that some kinds of speech and
writings, such as "obscenity," Roth v. United States (1957) and "fighting words,"
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942) are not expression within the protection of
the First Amendment, freedom to discuss public affairs and public officials is
unquestionably, as the Court today holds, the kind of speech the First
Amendment was primarily designed to keep within the area of free discussion.
To punish the exercise of this right to discuss public affairs or to penalize it
through libel judgments is to abridge or shut off discussion of the very kind
most needed. This Nation, I suspect, can live in peace without libel suits based
on public discussions of public affairs and public officials. But I doubt that a
country can live in freedom where its people can be made to suffer physically or
financially for criticizing their government, its actions, or its officials. "For a

representative democracy ceases to exist the moment that the public
functionaries are by any means absolved from their responsibility to their
constituents; and this happens whenever the constituent can be restrained in
any manner from speaking, writing, or publishing his opinions upon any public
measure, or upon the conduct of those who may advise or execute it." An
unconditional right to say what one pleases about public affairs is what I
consider to be the minimum guarantee of the First Amendment. I regret that
the Court has stopped short of this holding indispensable to preserve our free
press from destruction.

MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, WITH WHOM MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS JOINS, CONCURRING.
The Court today announces a constitutional standard which prohibits "a public
official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his
official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with `actual
malice' - that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of
whether it was false or not." The Court thus rules that the Constitution gives
citizens and newspapers a "conditional privilege" immunizing nonmalicious
misstatements of fact regarding the official conduct of a government officer. The
impressive array of history and precedent marshaled by the Court, however,
confirms my belief that the Constitution affords greater protection than that
provided by the Court's standard to citizen and press in exercising the right of
public criticism.
In my view, the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution afford to
the citizen and to the press an absolute, unconditional privilege to criticize
official conduct despite the harm which may flow from excesses and abuses.***

The First Amendment

In 1968 a Chicago policeman named Nuccio shot and killed a youth named
Nelson. The state authorities prosecuted Nuccio for the homicide and ultimately
obtained a conviction for murder in the second degree. The Nelson family
retained petitioner Elmer Gertz, a reputable attorney, to represent them in civil
litigation against Nuccio.
Respondent publishes American Opinion, a monthly outlet for the views of the
John Birch Society. Early in the 1960's the magazine began to warn of a
nationwide conspiracy to discredit local law enforcement agencies and create in
their stead a national police force capable of supporting a Communist
dictatorship. As part of the continuing effort to alert the public to this assumed
danger, the managing editor of American Opinion commissioned an article on
the murder trial of Officer Nuccio. For this purpose he engaged a regular
contributor to the magazine. In March 1969 respondent published the resulting
article under the title "FRAME-UP: Richard Nuccio and The War On Police." The
article purports to demonstrate that the testimony against Nuccio at his
criminal trial was false and that his prosecution was part of the Communist
campaign against the police.
In his capacity as counsel for the Nelson family in the civil litigation, petitioner
attended the coroner's inquest into the boy's death and initiated actions for
damages, but he neither discussed Officer Nuccio with the press nor played any
part in the criminal proceeding. Notwithstanding petitioner's remote connection
with the prosecution of Nuccio, respondent's magazine portrayed him as an
architect of the "frame-up." According to the article, the police file on petitioner
took "a big, Irish cop to lift." The article stated that petitioner had been an
official of the "Marxist League for Industrial Democracy, originally known as the
Intercollegiate Socialist Society, which has advocated the violent seizure of our
government." It labeled Gertz a "Leninist" and a "Communist-fronter." It also
stated that Gertz had been an officer of the National Lawyers Guild, described
as a Communist organization that "probably did more than any other outfit to
plan the Communist attack on the Chicago police during the 1968 Democratic
Convention."
These statements contained serious inaccuracies. The implication that
petitioner had a criminal record was false. Petitioner had been a member and
officer of the National Lawyers Guild some 15 years earlier, but there was no
evidence that he or that organization had taken any part in planning the 1968
demonstrations in Chicago. There was also no basis for the charge that
petitioner was a "Leninist" or a "Communist-fronter." And he had never been a
member of the "Marxist League for Industrial Democracy" or the "Intercollegiate
Socialist Society."
The managing editor of American Opinion made no effort to verify or
substantiate the charges against petitioner. Instead, he appended an editorial
introduction stating that the author had "conducted extensive research into the
Richard Nuccio Case." And he included in the article a photograph of petitioner
and wrote the caption that appeared under it: "Elmer Gertz of Red Guild
harrasses Nuccio." Respondent placed the issue of American Opinion

Robson

234

The First Amendment

containing the article on sale at newsstands throughout the country and
distributed reprints of the article on the streets of Chicago.
Petitioner filed a diversity action for libel in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois. He claimed that the falsehoods published by
respondent injured his reputation as a lawyer and a citizen. *** After answering
the complaint, respondent filed a pretrial motion for summary judgment,
claiming a constitutional privilege against liability for defamation. It asserted
that petitioner was a public official or a public figure and that the article
concerned an issue of public interest and concern. For these reasons,
respondent argued, it was entitled to invoke the privilege enunciated in New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). Under this rule respondent would escape
liability unless petitioner could prove publication of defamatory falsehood "with
`actual malice' - that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless
disregard of whether it was false or not." Respondent claimed that petitioner
could not make such a showing and submitted a supporting affidavit by the
magazine's managing editor. The editor denied any knowledge of the falsity of
the statements concerning petitioner and stated that he had relied on the
author's reputation and on his prior experience with the accuracy and
authenticity of the author's contributions to American Opinion.
The District Court denied respondent's motion for summary judgment ***. The
court did not dispute respondent's claim to the protection of the New York
Times standard. *** It thought that respondent's claim to the protection of the
constitutional privilege depended on the contention that petitioner was either a
public official under the New York Times decision *** apparently discounting
the argument that a privilege would arise from the presence of a public issue.
After all the evidence had been presented but before submission of the case to
the jury, the court ruled in effect that petitioner was neither a public official nor
a public figure. *** The jury awarded $50,000 to petitioner.
Following the jury verdict and on further reflection, the District Court
concluded that the New York Times standard should govern this case even
though petitioner was not a public official or public figure. It accepted
respondent's contention that that privilege protected discussion of any public
issue without regard to the status of a person defamed therein. Accordingly, the
court entered judgment for respondent notwithstanding the jury's verdict. ***
Petitioner appealed to contest the applicability of the New York Times standard
to this case. Although the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit doubted the
correctness of the District Court's determination that petitioner was not a
public figure, it did not overturn that finding. It agreed with the District Court
that respondent could assert the constitutional privilege because the article
concerned a matter of public interest *** After reviewing the record, the Court of
Appeals endorsed the District Court's conclusion that petitioner had failed to
show by clear and convincing evidence that respondent had acted with "actual
malice" as defined by New York Times. There was no evidence that the
managing editor of American Opinion knew of the falsity of the accusations
made in the article. In fact, he knew nothing about petitioner except what he

Robson

235

The First Amendment

learned from the article. The court correctly noted that mere proof of failure to
investigate, without more, cannot establish reckless disregard for the truth. ***
The Court of Appeals therefore affirmed. For the reasons stated below, we
reverse.
II
The principal issue in this case is whether a newspaper or broadcaster that
publishes defamatory falsehoods about an individual who is neither a public
official nor a public figure may claim a constitutional privilege against liability
for the injury inflicted by those statements. ***
III
We begin with the common ground. Under the First Amendment there is no
such thing as a false idea. However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend
for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the
competition of other ideas. But there is no constitutional value in false
statements of fact. Neither the intentional lie nor the careless error materially
advances society's interest in "uninhibited, robust, and wide-open" debate on
public issues. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. They belong to that category of
utterances which "are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of
such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived
from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality."
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942).
Although the erroneous statement of fact is not worthy of constitutional
protection, it is nevertheless inevitable in free debate. As James Madison
pointed out in the Report on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798: "Some degree of
abuse is inseparable from the proper use of every thing; and in no instance is
this more true than in that of the press." 4 J. ELLIOT, DEBATES ON THE FEDERAL
CONSTITUTION OF 1787, p. 571 (1876). And punishment of error runs the risk of
inducing a cautious and restrictive exercise of the constitutionally guaranteed
freedoms of speech and press. Our decisions recognize that a rule of strict
liability that compels a publisher or broadcaster to guarantee the accuracy of
his factual assertions may lead to intolerable self-censorship. Allowing the
media to avoid liability only by proving the truth of all injurious statements
does not accord adequate protection to First Amendment liberties. As the Court
stated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan: "Allowance of the defense of truth,
with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not mean that only false
speech will be deterred." The First Amendment requires that we protect some
falsehood in order to protect speech that matters.
The need to avoid self-censorship by the news media is, however, not the only
societal value at issue. If it were, this Court would have embraced long ago the
view that publishers and broadcasters enjoy an unconditional and indefeasible
immunity from liability for defamation. Such a rule would, indeed, obviate the
fear that the prospect of civil liability for injurious falsehood might dissuade a
timorous press from the effective exercise of First Amendment freedoms. Yet

Robson

236

The First Amendment

absolute protection for the communications media requires a total sacrifice of
the competing value served by the law of defamation.
The legitimate state interest underlying the law of libel is the compensation of
individuals for the harm inflicted on them by defamatory falsehood. ***
Some tension necessarily exists between the need for a vigorous and
uninhibited press and the legitimate interest in redressing wrongful injury. As
Mr. Justice Harlan stated, "some antithesis between freedom of speech and
press and libel actions persists, for libel remains premised on the content of
speech and limits the freedom of the publisher to express certain sentiments, at
least without guaranteeing legal proof of their substantial accuracy." Curtis
Publishing Co. v. Butts. In our continuing effort to define the proper
accommodation between these competing concerns, we have been especially
anxious to assure to the freedoms of speech and press that "breathing space"
essential to their fruitful exercise. NAACP v. Button (1963). To that end this
Court has extended a measure of strategic protection to defamatory falsehood.
The New York Times standard defines the level of constitutional protection
appropriate to the context of defamation of a public person. Those who, by
reason of the notoriety of their achievements or the vigor and success with
which they seek the public's attention, are properly classed as public figures
and those who hold governmental office may recover for injury to reputation
only on clear and convincing proof that the defamatory falsehood was made
with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth. This
standard administers an extremely powerful antidote to the inducement to
media self-censorship of the common-law rule of strict liability for libel and
slander. And it exacts a correspondingly high price from the victims of
defamatory falsehood. Plainly many deserving plaintiffs, including some
intentionally subjected to injury, will be unable to surmount the barrier of the
New York Times test. Despite this substantial abridgment of the state law right
to compensation for wrongful hurt to one's reputation, the Court has concluded
that the protection of the New York Times privilege should be available to
publishers and broadcasters of defamatory falsehood concerning public officials
and public figures. We think that these decisions are correct, but we do not find
their holdings justified solely by reference to the interest of the press and
broadcast media in immunity from liability. Rather, we believe that the New
York Times rule states an accommodation between this concern and the limited
state interest present in the context of libel actions brought by public persons.
For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the state interest in
compensating injury to the reputation of private individuals requires that a
different rule should obtain with respect to them.
Theoretically, of course, the balance between the needs of the press and the
individual's claim to compensation for wrongful injury might be struck on a
case-by-case basis. *** But this approach would lead to unpredictable results
and uncertain expectations, and it could render our duty to supervise the lower
courts unmanageable. Because an ad hoc resolution of the competing interests
at stake in each particular case is not feasible, we must lay down broad rules of

Robson

237

The First Amendment

general application. Such rules necessarily treat alike various cases involving
differences as well as similarities. Thus it is often true that not all of the
considerations which justify adoption of a given rule will obtain in each
particular case decided under its authority.
With that caveat we have no difficulty in distinguishing among defamation
plaintiffs. The first remedy of any victim of defamation is self-help - using
available opportunities to contradict the lie or correct the error and thereby to
minimize its adverse impact on reputation. Public officials and public figures
usually enjoy significantly greater access to the channels of effective
communication and hence have a more realistic opportunity to counteract false
statements than private individuals normally enjoy. Private individuals are
therefore more vulnerable to injury, and the state interest in protecting them is
correspondingly greater.
More important than the likelihood that private individuals will lack effective
opportunities for rebuttal, there is a compelling normative consideration
underlying the distinction between public and private defamation plaintiffs. An
individual who decides to seek governmental office must accept certain
necessary consequences of that involvement in public affairs. He runs the risk
of closer public scrutiny than might otherwise be the case. And society's
interest in the officers of government is not strictly limited to the formal
discharge of official duties. As the Court pointed out in Garrison v. Louisiana,
the public's interest extends to "anything which might touch on an official's
fitness for office . . . . Few personal attributes are more germane to fitness for
office than dishonesty, malfeasance, or improper motivation, even though these
characteristics may also affect the official's private character."
Those classed as public figures stand in a similar position. Hypothetically, it
may be possible for someone to become a public figure through no purposeful
action of his own, but the instances of truly involuntary public figures must be
exceedingly rare. For the most part those who attain this status have assumed
roles of especial prominence in the affairs of society. Some occupy positions of
such persuasive power and influence that they are deemed public figures for all
purposes. More commonly, those classed as public figures have thrust
themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to
influence the resolution of the issues involved. In either event, they invite
attention and comment.
Even if the foregoing generalities do not obtain in every instance, the
communications media are entitled to act on the assumption that public
officials and public figures have voluntarily exposed themselves to increased
risk of injury from defamatory falsehood concerning them. No such assumption
is justified with respect to a private individual. He has not accepted public office
or assumed an "influential role in ordering society." He has relinquished no
part of his interest in the protection of his own good name, and consequently he
has a more compelling call on the courts for redress of injury inflicted by
defamatory falsehood. Thus, private individuals are not only more vulnerable to

Robson

238

The First Amendment

injury than public officials and public figures; they are also more deserving of
recovery.
For these reasons we conclude that the States should retain substantial
latitude in their efforts to enforce a legal remedy for defamatory falsehood
injurious to the reputation of a private individual. *** Nor does the Constitution
require us to draw so thin a line between the drastic alternatives of the New
York Times privilege and the common law of strict liability for defamatory error.
The "public or general interest" test for determining the applicability of the New
York Times standard to private defamation actions inadequately serves both of
the competing values at stake. On the one hand, a private individual whose
reputation is injured by defamatory falsehood that does concern an issue of
public or general interest has no recourse unless he can meet the rigorous
requirements of New York Times. This is true despite the factors that
distinguish the state interest in compensating private individuals from the
analogous interest involved in the context of public persons. On the other hand,
a publisher or broadcaster of a defamatory error which a court deems unrelated
to an issue of public or general interest may be held liable in damages even if it
took every reasonable precaution to ensure the accuracy of its assertions. And
liability may far exceed compensation for any actual injury to the plaintiff, for
the jury may be permitted to presume damages without proof of loss and even
to award punitive damages.
We hold that, so long as they do not impose liability without fault, the States
may define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or
broadcaster of defamatory falsehood injurious to a private individual. 10 This
approach provides a more equitable boundary between the competing concerns
involved here. It recognizes the strength of the legitimate state interest in
compensating private individuals for wrongful injury to reputation, yet shields
the press and broadcast media from the rigors of strict liability for defamation.
At least this conclusion obtains where, as here, the substance of the defamatory
statement "makes substantial danger to reputation apparent." This phrase
places in perspective the conclusion we announce today. Our inquiry would
involve considerations somewhat different from those discussed above if a State
purported to condition civil liability on a factual misstatement whose content
did not warn a reasonably prudent editor or broadcaster of its defamatory
potential. Such a case is not now before us, and we intimate no view as to its
proper resolution.

Notwithstanding our refusal to extend the New York Times privilege to
defamation of private individuals, respondent contends that we should affirm
the judgment below on the ground that petitioner is either a public official or a
public figure. There is little basis for the former assertion. Several years prior to
the present incident, petitioner had served briefly on housing committees
appointed by the mayor of Chicago, but at the time of publication he had never

Robson

239

The First Amendment

held any remunerative governmental position. Respondent admits this but
argues that petitioner's appearance at the coroner's inquest rendered him a "de
facto public official." Our cases recognize no such concept. Respondent's
suggestion would sweep all lawyers under the New York Times rule as officers of
the court and distort the plain meaning of the "public official" category beyond
all recognition. We decline to follow it.
Respondent's characterization of petitioner as a public figure raises a different
question. That designation may rest on either of two alternative bases. In some
instances an individual may achieve such pervasive fame or notoriety that he
becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts. More commonly, an
individual voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public
controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues. In
either case such persons assume special prominence in the resolution of public
questions.
Petitioner has long been active in community and professional affairs. He has
served as an officer of local civic groups and of various professional
organizations, and he has published several books and articles on legal
subjects. Although petitioner was consequently well known in some circles, he
had achieved no general fame or notoriety in the community. None of the
prospective jurors called at the trial had ever heard of petitioner prior to this
litigation, and respondent offered no proof that this response was atypical of the
local population. We would not lightly assume that a citizen's participation in
community and professional affairs rendered him a public figure for all
purposes. Absent clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community,
and pervasive involvement in the affairs of society, an individual should not be
deemed a public personality for all aspects of his life. It is preferable to reduce
the public-figure question to a more meaningful context by looking to the
nature and extent of an individual's participation in the particular controversy
giving rise to the defamation.
In this context it is plain that petitioner was not a public figure. He played a
minimal role at the coroner's inquest, and his participation related solely to his
representation of a private client. He took no part in the criminal prosecution of
Officer Nuccio. Moreover, he never discussed either the criminal or civil
litigation with the press and was never quoted as having done so. He plainly did
not thrust himself into the vortex of this public issue, nor did he engage the
public's attention in an attempt to influence its outcome. We are persuaded
that the trial court did not err in refusing to characterize petitioner as a public
figure for the purpose of this litigation.
We therefore conclude that the New York Times standard is inapplicable to this
case and that the trial court erred in entering judgment for respondent.
Because the jury was allowed to impose liability without fault and was
permitted to presume damages without proof of injury, a new trial is necessary.
We reverse and remand for further proceedings in accord with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

The First Amendment

DOUGLAS, J., DISSENTING.
The Court describes this case as a return to the struggle of "defin[ing] the
proper accommodation between the law of defamation and the freedoms of
speech and press protected by the First Amendment." It is indeed a struggle,
once described by Mr. Justice Black as "the same quagmire" in which the Court
"is now helplessly struggling in the field of obscenity." I would suggest that the
struggle is a quite hopeless one, for, in light of the command of the First
Amendment, no "accommodation" of its freedoms can be "proper" except those
made by the Framers themselves.
Unlike the right of privacy which, by the terms of the Fourth Amendment, must
be accommodated with reasonable searches and seizures and warrants issued
by magistrates, the rights of free speech and of a free press were protected by
the Framers in verbiage whose proscription seems clear. I have stated before my
view that the First Amendment would bar Congress from passing any libel law.
This was the view held by Thomas Jefferson and it is one Congress has never
challenged through enactment of a civil libel statute. The sole congressional
attempt at this variety of First Amendment muzzle was in the Sedition Act of
1798 - a criminal libel act never tested in this Court and one which expired by
its terms three years after enactment. As President, Thomas Jefferson pardoned
those who were convicted under the Act, and fines levied in its prosecution were
repaid by Act of Congress. The general consensus was that the Act constituted
a regrettable legislative exercise plainly in violation of the First Amendment. ***
There can be no doubt that a State impinges upon free and open discussion
when it sanctions the imposition of damages for such discussion through its
civil libel laws. Discussion of public affairs is often marked by highly charged
emotions, and jurymen, not unlike us all, are subject to those emotions. It is
indeed this very type of speech which is the reason for the First Amendment
since speech which arouses little emotion is little in need of protection. The
vehicle for publication in this case was the American Opinion, a most
controversial periodical which disseminates the views of the John Birch Society,
an organization which many deem to be quite offensive. The subject matter
involved "Communist plots," "conspiracies against law enforcement agencies,"
and the killing of a private citizen by the police. With any such amalgam of
controversial elements pressing upon the jury, a jury determination,
unpredictable in the most neutral circumstances, becomes for those who
venture to discuss heated issues, a virtual roll of the dice separating them from
liability for often massive claims of damage.
It is only the hardy publisher who will engage in discussion in the face of such
risk, and the Court's preoccupation with proliferating standards in the area of
libel increases the risks. It matters little whether the standard be articulated as
"malice" or "reckless disregard of the truth" or "negligence," for jury
determinations by any of those criteria are virtually unreviewable. This Court,
in its continuing delineation of variegated mantles of First Amendment
protection, is, like the potential publisher, left with only speculation on how
jury findings were influenced by the effect the subject matter of the publication

Robson

241

The First Amendment

had upon the minds and viscera of the jury. The standard announced today
leaves the States free to "define for themselves the appropriate standard of
liability for a publisher or broadcaster" in the circumstances of this case. This
of course leaves the simple negligence standard as an option, with the jury free
to impose damages upon a finding that the publisher failed to act as "a
reasonable man." With such continued erosion of First Amendment protection, I
fear that it may well be the reasonable man who refrains from speaking.
Since in my view the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the imposition
of damages upon respondent for this discussion of public affairs, I would affirm
the judgment below.

OPINIONS OF BURGER, C.J., BRENNAN, AND WHITE ARE OMITTED].

Notes	  	  
1.
In Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S. 749
(1985), the Court refused to extend Gertz to a nonmedia defendant in a
matter not of “public concern.” The facts, as explained in the Court’s
plurality opinion, authored by Justice Powell, and joined by Justices
Rehnquist and O’Connor were these:
Petitioner Dun & Bradstreet, a credit reporting agency, provides subscribers
with financial and related information about businesses. All the information is
confidential; under the terms of the subscription agreement the subscribers may
not reveal it to anyone else. On July 26, 1976, petitioner sent a report to five
subscribers indicating that respondent, a construction contractor, had filed a
voluntary petition for bankruptcy. This report was false and grossly
misrepresented respondent's assets and liabilities. That same day, while
discussing the possibility of future financing with its bank, respondent's
president was told that the bank had received the defamatory report. He
immediately called petitioner's regional office, explained the error, and asked for
a correction. In addition, he requested the names of the firms that had received
the false report in order to assure them that the company was solvent. Petitioner
promised to look into the matter but refused to divulge the names of those who
had received the report.
After determining that its report was indeed false, petitioner issued a corrective
notice on or about August 3, 1976, to the five subscribers who had received the
initial report. The notice stated that one of respondent's former employees, not
respondent itself, had filed for bankruptcy and that respondent “continued in
business as usual.” Respondent told petitioner that it was dissatisfied with the
notice, and it again asked for a list of subscribers who had seen the initial report.
Again petitioner refused to divulge their names.
Respondent then brought this defamation action in Vermont state court. It
alleged that the false report had injured its reputation and sought both
compensatory and punitive damages. The trial established that the error in
petitioner's report had been caused when one of its employees, a 17-year-old

Robson

242

The First Amendment

high school student paid to review Vermont bankruptcy pleadings, had
inadvertently attributed to respondent a bankruptcy petition filed by one of
respondent's former employees. Although petitioner's representative testified
that it was routine practice to check the accuracy of such reports with the
businesses themselves, it did not try to verify the information about respondent
before reporting it.

The Court held that “actual malice,” the standard derived from New York
Times v. Sullivan, was not applicable and concluded that damages - - even presumed damages or punitive damages - - - were permissible. It
declined to “constitutionalize the entire common law of libel.” (Id. at 761
n.7). Thus, one might say that Dun & Bradstreet marks the limit to the
Court’s First Amendment shaping of defamation.
Moreover, Dun & Bradstreet might be most important for what it did not
decide. Argued twice, it provided an opportunity for the Court to revisit
both New York Times and Gertz, as some Justices reportedly were wont
to do. See Lee Levine & Stephen Wermiel, The Landmark That Wasn't: A
First Amendment Play in Five Acts, 88 WASH. L. REV. 1 (2013). As Levine
and Wermeil noted as the fiftieth anniversary of New York Times v.
Sullivan was approaching, and as remains true, the Court has not
decided another defamation case since Dun & Bradstreet. However, the
Court certainly has considered similar issues, such as false statements
in United States v. Alvarez (2012), we which we previously covered, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress in Snyder v. Phelps (2011),
which we will consider in a subsequent chapter. Neither of these cases
involved the press, but both rely heavily on defamation precedent.
2.
What about bloggers who are sued for defamation? In Obsidian Fin.
Grp., LLC v. Cox, 740 F.3d 1284 (9th Cir.) cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 2680
(2014), the Ninth Circuit agreed with other circuits that
The protections of the First Amendment do not turn on whether the defendant
was a trained journalist, formally affiliated with traditional news entities,
engaged in conflict-of-interest disclosure, went beyond just assembling others'
writings, or tried to get both sides of a story. As the Supreme Court has
accurately warned, a First Amendment distinction between the institutional
press and other speakers is unworkable: “With the advent of the Internet and
the decline of print and broadcast media ... the line between the media and
others who wish to comment on political and social issues becomes far more
blurred.” Citizens United (2010) [Chapter 8]. In defamation cases, the publicfigure status of a plaintiff and the public importance of the statement at issue—
to the identity of the speaker—provide the First Amendment touchstones.

Id. at 1291. Yet the facts of Obsidian might be troubling to some:
Kevin Padrick is a principal of Obsidian Finance Group, LLC (Obsidian), a firm
that provides advice to financially distressed businesses. In December 2008,
Summit Accommodators, Inc. (Summit), retained Obsidian in connection with a
contemplated bankruptcy. After Summit filed for reorganization, the bankruptcy
court appointed Padrick as the Chapter 11 trustee. Because Summit had

Robson

243

The First Amendment

misappropriated funds from clients, Padrick's principal task was to marshal the
firm's assets for the benefit of those clients.
After Padrick's appointment, Crystal Cox published blog posts on several
websites that she created, accusing Padrick and Obsidian of fraud, corruption,
money-laundering, and other illegal activities in connection with the Summit
bankruptcy. Cox apparently has a history of making similar allegations and
seeking payoffs in exchange for retraction. See David Carr, When Truth Survives
Free Speech, N.Y. Times, Dec. 11, 2011, at B1. Padrick and Obsidian sent Cox a
cease-and-desist letter, but she continued posting allegations. This defamation
suit ensued.

Id. at 1287. Do you agree that the Gertz standard should apply?

OPINION CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART. FORTAS, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION
IN WHICH THE CHIEF JUSTICE [WARREN] AND CLARK JOINED.

JUSTICE BRENNAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The question in this case is whether appellant, publisher of Life Magazine, was
denied constitutional protections of speech and press by the application by the
New York courts of 50-51 of the New York Civil Rights Law [fn1] to award
appellee damages on allegations that Life falsely reported that a new play
portrayed an experience suffered by appellee and his family.
[fn 1: The complete text of the New York Civil Rights Law 50-51 is as follows:
" 50. Right of privacy
"A person, firm or corporation that uses for advertising purposes, or for
the purposes of trade, the name, portrait or picture of any living person without
having first obtained the written consent of such person, or if a minor of his or
her parent or guardian, is guilty of a misdemeanor."
" 51. Action for injunction and for damages
"Any person whose name, portrait or picture is used within this state for
advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade without the written consent
first obtained as above provided may maintain an equitable action in the
supreme court of this state against the person, firm or corporation so using his
name, portrait or picture, to prevent and restrain the use thereof; and may also
sue and recover damages for any injuries sustained by reason of such use and if
the defendant shall have knowingly used such person's name, portrait or picture
in such manner as is forbidden or declared to be unlawful by the last section,
the jury, in its discretion, may award exemplary damages. But nothing
contained in this act shall be so construed as to prevent any person, firm or
corporation, practicing the profession of photography, from exhibiting in or
about his or its establishment specimens of the work of such establishment,

Robson

244

The First Amendment

unless the same is continued by such person, firm or corporation after written
notice objecting thereto has been given by the person portrayed; and nothing
contained in this act shall be so construed as to prevent any person, firm or
corporation from using the name, portrait or picture of any manufacturer or
dealer in connection with the goods, wares and merchandise manufactured,
produced or dealt in by him which he has sold or disposed of with such name,
portrait or picture used in connection therewith; or from using the name,
portrait or picture of any author, composer or artist in connection with his
literary, musical or artistic productions which he has sold or disposed of with
such name, portrait or picture used in connection therewith." ]

The article appeared in Life in February 1955. It was entitled "True Crime
Inspires Tense Play," with the subtitle, "The ordeal of a family trapped by
convicts gives Broadway a new thriller, ‘The Desperate Hours.’" The text of the
article reads as follows:
"Three years ago Americans all over the country read about the desperate ordeal
of the James Hill family, who were held prisoners in their home outside
Philadelphia by three escaped convicts. Later they read about it in Joseph
Hayes's novel, The Desperate Hours, inspired by the family's experience. Now
they can see the story re-enacted in Hayes's Broadway play based on the book,
and next year will see it in his movie, which has been filmed but is being held up
until the play has a chance to pay off.
"The play, directed by Robert Montgomery and expertly acted, is a heartstopping account of how a family rose to heroism in a crisis. LIFE photographed
the play during its Philadelphia tryout, transported some of the actors to the
actual house where the Hills were besieged. On the next page scenes from the
play are re-enacted on the site of the crime."

The pictures on the ensuing two pages included an enactment of the son being
"roughed up" by one of the convicts, entitled "brutish convict," a picture of the
daughter biting the hand of a convict to make him drop a gun, entitled "daring
daughter," and one of the father throwing his gun through the door after a
"brave try" to save his family is foiled.
The James Hill referred to in the article is the appellee. He and his wife and five
children involuntarily became the subjects of a front-page news story after
being held hostage by three escaped convicts in their suburban, Whitemarsh,
Pennsylvania, home for 19 hours on September 11-12, 1952. The family was
released unharmed. In an interview with newsmen after the convicts departed,
appellee stressed that the convicts had treated the family courteously, had not
molested them, and had not been at all violent. The convicts were thereafter
apprehended in a widely publicized encounter with the police which resulted in
the killing of two of the convicts. Shortly thereafter the family moved to
Connecticut. The appellee discouraged all efforts to keep them in the public
spotlight through magazine articles or appearances on television.
In the spring of 1953, Joseph Hayes' novel, The Desperate Hours, was published.
The story depicted the experience of a family of four held hostage by three
escaped convicts in the family's suburban home. But, unlike Hill's experience,
the family of the story suffer violence at the hands of the convicts; the father
and son are beaten and the daughter subjected to a verbal sexual insult.

Robson

245

The First Amendment

The book was made into a play, also entitled The Desperate Hours, and it is
Life's article about the play which is the subject of appellee's action. The
complaint sought damages under [the New York statute] on allegations that the
Life article was intended to, and did, give the impression that the play mirrored
the Hill family's experience, which, to the knowledge of defendant ". . . was false
and untrue." Appellant's defense was that the article was "a subject of
legitimate news interest," "a subject of general interest and of value and concern
to the public" at the time of publication, and that it was "published in good faith
without any malice whatsoever . . . ." A motion to dismiss the complaint for
substantially these reasons was made at the close of the case and was denied
by the trial judge on the ground that the proofs presented a jury question as to
the truth of the article.
The jury awarded appellee $50,000 compensatory and $25,000 punitive
damages. On appeal the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court ordered a new
trial as to damages but sustained the jury verdict of liability. ***
At the new trial on damages, a jury was waived and the court awarded $30,000
compensatory damages without punitive damages. The New York Court of
Appeals affirmed the Appellate Division "on the majority and concurring
opinions at the Appellate Division," two judges dissenting. We noted probable
jurisdiction of the appeal to consider the important constitutional questions of
freedom of speech and press involved. After argument last Term, the case was
restored to the docket for reargument. We reverse and remand the case to the
Court of Appeals for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
I.
*** The guarantees for speech and press are not the preserve of political
expression or comment upon public affairs, essential as those are to healthy
government. One need only pick up any newspaper or magazine to comprehend
the vast range of published matter which exposes persons to public view, both
private citizens and public officials. Exposure of the self to others in varying
degrees is a concomitant of life in a civilized community. The risk of this
exposure is an essential incident of life in a society which places a primary
value on freedom of speech and of press. "Freedom of discussion, if it would
fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which
information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope
with the exigencies of their period." "No suggestion can be found in the
Constitution that the freedom there guaranteed for speech and the press bears
an inverse ratio to the timeliness and importance of the ideas seeking
expression." Bridges v. California (1941). We have no doubt that the subject of
the Life article, the opening of a new play linked to an actual incident, is a
matter of public interest. *** Erroneous statement is no less inevitable in such a
case than in the case of comment upon public affairs, and in both, if innocent
or merely negligent, ". . . it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are
to have the `breathing space' that they `need . . . to survive'. . . ." New York
Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). As James Madison said, "Some degree of abuse is
inseparable from the proper use of every thing; and in no instance is this more
true than in that of the press." Elliot's DEBATES ON THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION
571 (1876 ed.). We create a grave risk of serious impairment of the
indispensable service of a free press in a free society if we saddle the press with

Robson

246

The First Amendment

the impossible burden of verifying to a certainty the facts associated in news
articles with a person's name, picture or portrait, particularly as related to nondefamatory matter. Even negligence would be a most elusive standard,
especially when the content of the speech itself affords no warning of
prospective harm to another through falsity. A negligence test would place on
the press the intolerable burden of guessing how a jury might assess the
reasonableness of steps taken by it to verify the accuracy of every reference to a
name, picture or portrait.
In this context, sanctions against either innocent or negligent misstatement
would present a grave hazard of discouraging the press from exercising the
constitutional guarantees. Those guarantees are not for the benefit of the press
so much as for the benefit of all of us. A broadly defined freedom of the press
assures the maintenance of our political system and an open society. Fear of
large verdicts in damage suits for innocent or merely negligent misstatement,
even fear of the expense involved in their defense, must inevitably cause
publishers to "steer . . . wider of the unlawful zone," New York Times Co. v.
Sullivan and thus "create the danger that the legitimate utterance will be
penalized."
But the constitutional guarantees can tolerate sanctions against calculated
falsehood without significant impairment of their essential function. We held in
New York Times that calculated falsehood enjoyed no immunity in the case of
alleged defamation of a public official concerning his official conduct. Similarly,
calculated falsehood should enjoy no immunity in the situation here presented
us. ***
We find applicable here the standard of knowing or reckless falsehood, not
through blind application of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, relating solely to
libel actions by public officials, but only upon consideration of the factors which
arise in the particular context of the application of the New York statute in
cases involving private individuals. This is neither a libel action by a private
individual nor a statutory action by a public official. Therefore, although the
First Amendment principles pronounced in New York Times guide our
conclusion, we reach that conclusion only by applying these principles in this
discrete context. It therefore serves no purpose to distinguish the facts here
from those in New York Times. Were this a libel action, the distinction which
has been suggested between the relative opportunities of the public official and
the private individual to rebut defamatory charges might be germane. And the
additional state interest in the protection of the individual against damage to
his reputation would be involved. Moreover, a different test might be required in
a statutory action by a public official, as opposed to a libel action by a public
official or a statutory action by a private individual. Different considerations
might arise concerning the degree of "waiver" of the protection the State might
afford. But the question whether the same standard should be applicable both
to persons voluntarily and involuntarily thrust into the public limelight is not
here before us.
II.
Turning to the facts of the present case, the proofs reasonably would support
either a jury finding of innocent or merely negligent misstatement by Life, or a

Robson

247

The First Amendment

finding that Life portrayed the play as a re-enactment of the Hill family's
experience reckless of the truth or with actual knowledge that the portrayal was
false. ***
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is set aside and the case is remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

Hustler	  Magazine	  v.	  Falwell	  
485 U.S. 46 (1988)

REHNQUIST, C.J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH BRENNAN, MARSHALL,
BLACKMUN, STEVENS, O'CONNOR, AND SCALIA, JJ., JOINED. WHITE, J., FILED AN OPINION
CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT. KENNEDY, J., TOOK NO PART IN THE CONSIDERATION OR DECISION
OF THE CASE.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Petitioner Hustler Magazine, Inc., is a magazine of nationwide circulation.
Respondent Jerry Falwell, a nationally known minister who has been active as a
commentator on politics and public affairs, sued petitioner and its publisher,
petitioner Larry Flynt, to recover damages for invasion of privacy, libel, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. The District Court directed a verdict
against respondent on the privacy claim, and submitted the other two claims to
a jury. The jury found for petitioners on the defamation claim, but found for
respondent on the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and
awarded damages. We now consider whether this award is consistent with the
First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.
The inside front cover of the November 1983 issue of Hustler Magazine featured
a "parody" of an advertisement for Campari Liqueur that contained the name
and picture of respondent and was entitled "Jerry Falwell talks about his first
time." This parody was modeled after actual Campari ads that included
interviews with various celebrities about their "first times." Although it was
apparent by the end of each interview that this meant the first time they
sampled Campari, the ads clearly played on the sexual double entendre of the
general subject of "first times." Copying the form and layout of these Campari
ads, Hustler's editors chose respondent as the featured celebrity and drafted an
alleged "interview" with him in which he states that his "first time" was during a
drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother in an outhouse. The Hustler
parody portrays respondent and his mother as drunk and immoral, and
suggests that respondent is a hypocrite who preaches only when he is drunk. In
small print at the bottom of the page, the ad contains the disclaimer, "ad
parody - not to be taken seriously." The magazine's table of contents also lists
the ad as "Fiction; Ad and Personality Parody."

Robson

248

The First Amendment

Soon after the November issue of Hustler became available to the public,
respondent brought this diversity action in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Virginia against Hustler Magazine, Inc., Larry C. Flynt,
and Flynt Distributing Co., Inc. Respondent stated in his complaint that
publication of the ad parody in Hustler entitled him to recover damages for libel,
invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The case
proceeded to trial. At the close of the evidence, the District Court granted a
directed verdict for petitioners on the invasion of privacy claim. The jury then
found against respondent on the libel claim, specifically finding that the ad
parody could not "reasonably be understood as describing actual facts about
[respondent] or actual events in which [he] participated." The jury ruled for
respondent on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, however,
and stated that he should be awarded $100,000 in compensatory damages, as
well as $50,000 each in punitive damages from petitioners. Petitioners' motion
for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied.
On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed
the judgment against petitioners. The court rejected petitioners' argument that
the "actual malice" standard of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), must be
met before respondent can recover for emotional distress. The court agreed that
because respondent is concededly a public figure, petitioners are "entitled to the
same level of first amendment protection in the claim for intentional infliction of
emotional distress that they received in [respondent's] claim for libel." But this
does not mean that a literal application of the actual malice rule is appropriate
in the context of an emotional distress claim. *** The Court of Appeals then
went on to reject the contention that because the jury found that the ad parody
did not describe actual facts about respondent, the ad was an opinion that is
protected by the First Amendment. As the court put it, this was "irrelevant," as
the issue is "whether [the ad's] publication was sufficiently outrageous to
constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress." Petitioners then filed a
petition for rehearing en banc, but this was denied by a divided court. Given the
importance of the constitutional issues involved, we granted certiorari.
This case presents us with a novel question involving First Amendment
limitations upon a State's authority to protect its citizens from the intentional
infliction of emotional distress. We must decide whether a public figure may
recover damages for emotional harm caused by the publication of an ad parody
offensive to him, and doubtless gross and repugnant in the eyes of most.
Respondent would have us find that a State's interest in protecting public
figures from emotional distress is sufficient to deny First Amendment protection
to speech that is patently offensive and is intended to inflict emotional injury,
even when that speech could not reasonably have been interpreted as stating
actual facts about the public figure involved. This we decline to do.
At the heart of the First Amendment is the recognition of the fundamental
importance of the free flow of ideas and opinions on matters of public interest
and concern. "[T]he freedom to speak one's mind is not only an aspect of
individual liberty - and thus a good unto itself - but also is essential to the
common quest for truth and the vitality of society as a whole." We have
therefore been particularly vigilant to ensure that individual expressions of
ideas remain free from governmentally imposed sanctions. The First

Robson

249

The First Amendment

Amendment recognizes no such thing as a "false" idea. Gertz v. Robert Welch,
Inc. (1974). As Justice Holmes wrote, "when men have realized that time has
upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they
believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired
is better reached by free trade in ideas - that the best test of truth is the power
of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market . . . ."
Abrams v. United States (1919) (dissenting opinion).
The sort of robust political debate encouraged by the First Amendment is bound
to produce speech that is critical of those who hold public office or those public
figures who are "intimately involved in the resolution of important public
questions or, by reason of their fame, shape events in areas of concern to
society at large." ***
Of course, this does not mean that any speech about a public figure is immune
from sanction in the form of damages. Since New York Times Co. v. Sullivan
(1964), we have consistently ruled that a public figure may hold a speaker liable
for the damage to reputation caused by publication of a defamatory falsehood,
but only if the statement was made "with knowledge that it was false or with
reckless disregard of whether it was false or not." False statements of fact are
particularly valueless; they interfere with the truth-seeking function of the
marketplace of ideas, and they cause damage to an individual's reputation that
cannot easily be repaired by counterspeech, however persuasive or effective.
But even though falsehoods have little value in and of themselves, they are
"nevertheless inevitable in free debate," and a rule that would impose strict
liability on a publisher for false factual assertions would have an undoubted
"chilling" effect on speech relating to public figures that does have
constitutional value. "Freedoms of expression require "`breathing space.'" This
breathing space is provided by a constitutional rule that allows public figures to
recover for libel or defamation only when they can prove both that the
statement was false and that the statement was made with the requisite level of
culpability.
Respondent argues, however, that a different standard should apply in this case
because here the State seeks to prevent not reputational damage, but the
severe emotional distress suffered by the person who is the subject of an
offensive publication. In respondent's view, and in the view of the Court of
Appeals, so long as the utterance was intended to inflict emotional distress, was
outrageous, and did in fact inflict serious emotional distress, it is of no
constitutional import whether the statement was a fact or an opinion, or
whether it was true or false. It is the intent to cause injury that is the gravamen
of the tort, and the State's interest in preventing emotional harm simply
outweighs whatever interest a speaker may have in speech of this type.
Generally speaking the law does not regard the intent to inflict emotional
distress as one which should receive much solicitude, and it is quite
understandable that most if not all jurisdictions have chosen to make it civilly
culpable where the conduct in question is sufficiently "outrageous." But in the
world of debate about public affairs, many things done with motives that are
less than admirable are protected by the First Amendment. *** Thus while
such a bad motive may be deemed controlling for purposes of tort liability in

Robson

250

The First Amendment

other areas of the law, we think the First Amendment prohibits such a result in
the area of public debate about public figures.
Were we to hold otherwise, there can be little doubt that political cartoonists
and satirists would be subjected to damages awards without any showing that
their work falsely defamed its subject. Webster's defines a caricature as "the
deliberately distorted picturing or imitating of a person, literary style, etc. by
exaggerating features or mannerisms for satirical effect." WEBSTER'S NEW
UNABRIDGED TWENTIETH CENTURY DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 275 (2d
ed. 1979). The appeal of the political cartoon or caricature is often based on
exploitation of unfortunate physical traits or politically embarrassing events an exploitation often calculated to injure the feelings of the subject of the
portrayal. The art of the cartoonist is often not reasoned or evenhanded, but
slashing and one-sided. One cartoonist expressed the nature of the art in these
words:
"The political cartoon is a weapon of attack, of scorn and ridicule and satire; it is
least effective when it tries to pat some politician on the back. It is usually as
welcome as a bee sting and is always controversial in some quarters."

Long, The Political Cartoon: Journalism's Strongest Weapon, THE QUILL 56, 57
(Nov. 1962).
Several famous examples of this type of intentionally injurious speech were
drawn by Thomas Nast, probably the greatest American cartoonist to date, who
was associated for many years during the post-Civil War era with Harper's
Weekly. In the pages of that publication Nast conducted a graphic vendetta
against William M. "Boss" Tweed and his corrupt associates in New York City's
"Tweed Ring." It has been described by one historian of the subject as "a
sustained attack which in its passion and effectiveness stands alone in the
history of American graphic art." M. KELLER, THE ART AND POLITICS OF THOMAS
NAST 177 (1968). Another writer explains that the success of the Nast cartoon
was achieved "because of the emotional impact of its presentation. It
continuously goes beyond the bounds of good taste and conventional manners."
C. PRESS, THE POLITICAL CARTOON 251 (1981).
Despite their sometimes caustic nature, from the early cartoon portraying
George Washington as an ass down to the present day, graphic depictions and
satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public and political debate.
Nast's castigation of the Tweed Ring, Walt McDougall's characterization of
Presidential candidate James G. Blaine's banquet with the millionaires at
Delmonico's as "The Royal Feast of Belshazzar," and numerous other efforts
have undoubtedly had an effect on the course and outcome of
contemporaneous debate. Lincoln's tall, gangling posture, Teddy Roosevelt's
glasses and teeth, and Franklin D. Roosevelt's jutting jaw and cigarette holder
have been memorialized by political cartoons with an effect that could not have
been obtained by the photographer or the portrait artist. From the viewpoint of
history it is clear that our political discourse would have been considerably
poorer without them.
Respondent contends, however, that the caricature in question here was so
"outrageous" as to distinguish it from more traditional political cartoons. There
is no doubt that the caricature of respondent and his mother published in

Robson

251

The First Amendment

Hustler is at best a distant cousin of the political cartoons described above, and
a rather poor relation at that. If it were possible by laying down a principled
standard to separate the one from the other, public discourse would probably
suffer little or no harm. But we doubt that there is any such standard, and we
are quite sure that the pejorative description "outrageous" does not supply one.
"Outrageousness" in the area of political and social discourse has an inherent
subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis
of the jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a
particular expression. An "outrageousness" standard thus runs afoul of our
longstanding refusal to allow damages to be awarded because the speech in
question may have an adverse emotional impact on the audience. ***
Admittedly, these oft-repeated First Amendment principles, like other principles,
are subject to limitations. *** But the sort of expression involved in this case
does not seem to us to be governed by any exception to the general First
Amendment principles stated above.
We conclude that public figures and public officials may not recover for the tort
of intentional infliction of emotional distress by reason of publications such as
the one here at issue without showing in addition that the publication contains
a false statement of fact which was made with "actual malice," i. e., with
knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard as to whether
or not it was true. This is not merely a "blind application" of the New York
Times standard, it reflects our considered judgment that such a standard is
necessary to give adequate "breathing space" to the freedoms protected by the
First Amendment.
Here it is clear that respondent Falwell is a "public figure" for purposes of First
Amendment law. The jury found against respondent on his libel claim when it
decided that the Hustler ad parody could not "reasonably be understood as
describing actual facts about [respondent] or actual events in which [he]
participated." The Court of Appeals interpreted the jury's finding to be that the
ad parody "was not reasonably believable," and in accordance with our custom
we accept this finding. Respondent is thus relegated to his claim for damages
awarded by the jury for the intentional infliction of emotional distress by
"outrageous" conduct. But for reasons heretofore stated this claim cannot,
consistently with the First Amendment, form a basis for the award of damages
when the conduct in question is the publication of a caricature such as the ad
parody involved here. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly
Reversed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY TOOK NO PART IN THE CONSIDERATION OR DECISION OF THIS CASE.
JUSTICE WHITE, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
As I see it, the decision in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), has little to do
with this case, for here the jury found that the ad contained no assertion of fact.
But I agree with the Court that the judgment below, which penalized the
publication of the parody, cannot be squared with the First Amendment.

1.
The lines between “truth” and “opinion” and “parody” are often
unclear. How important should it be that the target of a publication is a
public official or public figure under Gertz and Falwell?
2.
Consider this action for compensatory and punitive damages
alleging defamation, false light, interference with business relations, and
invasion of privacy based upon the publication of an article by journalist
Mark Warren on Esquire Magazine's Politics Blog.
The article was posted one day after the release of a book entitled “Where's the
Birth Certificate? The Case that Barack Obama is not Eligible to Be President,”
written by Jerome Corsi and published by Joseph Farah's WND Books. Farah's
website, WorldNetDaily, announced the book launch with the headline, “It's out!
The book that proves Obama's ineligible: Today's the day Corsi is unleashed to
tell all about that ‘birth certificate’ ” (emphasis in original). Approximately three
weeks earlier, President Obama had released his long-form birth certificate
showing that he was born in Hawaii. Warren's article was entitled “BREAKING:
Jerome Corsi's Birther Book Pulled from Shelves!” (emphasis in original). It stated,
in part: “In a stunning development one day after the release of [the Corsi book],
[Farah] has announced plans to recall and pulp the entire 200,000 first printing
run of the book, as well as announcing an offer to refund the purchase price to
anyone who has already bought ... the book.” Approximately ninety minutes
later, Esquire published an “update” on its blog “for those who didn't figure it
out,” that Warren's article was “satire”; the “update” clarified that the article was
untrue and referenced other “serious” Esquire articles on the birth certificate
issue. Farah observed the same day that he thought the blog post was a “poorly
executed parody.” Also that day, Warren told The Daily Caller that he had no
regrets about publishing the fictitious article and expressed his negative view of
the book's author; his statements were published on The Daily Caller website
that day and the following day.

In Farah v. Esquire Magazine, 736 F.3d 528 (D.C. Cir. 2013), the Court
upheld the dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a cause of
action. Interestingly, the court concluded that
[b]ecause Farah's and Corsi's defamation claim fails, so do their other tort
claims based upon the same allegedly defamatory speech. “[A] plaintiff may not
use related causes of action to avoid the constitutional requisites of a
defamation claim.” The First Amendment considerations that apply to
defamation therefore apply also to Farah's and Corsi's counts for false light, and
tortious interference.

This seems to “constitutionalize” a wide range of tort actions aimed at
speech. Is it relevant at all that the original blog post was not understood
as parody?

The First Amendment

Chapter	  Five:	  GOVERNMENT	  AS	  
EMPLOYER	  AND	  EDUCATOR	  	  
This chapter considers applications of the First Amendment’s speech
clause when the government is not acting as a general sovereign but is
acting as an employer or educator. The basic question in such instances
is the extent to which the First Amendment doctrine that generally
applies should also apply to the employment and educational contexts.
The doctrine plows a middle ground. The courts have rejected the
antiquated notion that public employment or education is a “privilege”
that requires the abandonment of constitutional rights. [This concept of
“unconstitutional conditions” is discussed in the next chapter]. The
courts have also rejected the notion that employees and students retain
the same First Amendment rights at work and school as they do outside
these contexts.

I.	  

The	  Politics	  of	  Public	  Employment	  	  	  

The First Amendment rights of public employees to engage in political
speech and campaigning is in tension with the interest in a government
that is not exclusively partisan and in which public employment
positions are attributable to political patronage.

Civil	  Service	  Commission	  v.	  National	  Association	  of	  Letter	  
Carriers	  	  
413 U.S. 548 (1973)

WHITE, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH BURGER, C. J., AND STEWART,
BLACKMUN, POWELL, AND REHNQUIST, JJ., JOINED. DOUGLAS, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION,
IN WHICH BRENNAN AND MARSHALL, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE WHITE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
On December 11, 1972, we noted probable jurisdiction of this appeal based on
a jurisdictional statement presenting the single question whether the
prohibition in § 9(a) of the Hatch Act, now codified in 5 U.S.C. § 7324 (a)(2),
against federal employees taking "an active part in political management or in
political campaigns," is unconstitutional on its face.
Section 7324(a) provides:
"An employee in an Executive agency or an individual employed by the
government of the District of Columbia may not —
"(1) use his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or
affecting the result of an election; or
"(2) take an active part in political management or in political campaigns.
"For the purpose of this subsection, the phrase `an active part in political
management or in political campaigns' means those acts of political
management or political campaigning which were prohibited on the part of
employees in the competitive service before July 19, 1940, by determinations of
the Civil Service Commission under the rules prescribed by the President."

A divided three-judge court sitting in the District of Columbia had held the
section unconstitutional. We reverse the judgment of the District Court.

I
The case began when the National Association of Letter Carriers, six individual
federal employees and certain local Democratic and Republican political
committees filed a complaint, asserting on behalf of themselves and all federal
employees that 5 U.S.C. § 7324 (a)(2) was unconstitutional on its face and
seeking an injunction against its enforcement. Each of the plaintiffs alleged that
the Civil Service Commission was enforcing, or threatening to enforce, the

Robson

255

The First Amendment

Hatch Act's prohibition against active participation in political management or
political campaigns with respect to certain defined activity in which that
plaintiff desired to engage. The Union, for example, stated among other things
that its members desired to campaign for candidates for public office. The
Democratic and Republican Committees complained of not being able to get
federal employees to run for state and local offices. Plaintiff Hummel stated that
he was aware of the provision of the Hatch Act and that the activities he desired
to engage in would violate that Act as, for example, his participating as a
delegate in a party convention or holding office in a political club.
A three-judge court was convened, and the case was tried on both stipulated
evidence and oral testimony. The District Court then ruled that § 7324(a)(2) was
unconstitutional on its face and enjoined its enforcement. The court recognized
the "well-established governmental interest in restricting political activities by
federal employees which [had been] asserted long before enactment of the Hatch
Act," as well as the fact that the "appropriateness of this governmental objective
was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States when it endorsed the
objectives of the Hatch Act. ***
II
*** Our judgment is that neither the First Amendment nor any other provision
of the Constitution invalidates a law barring this kind of partisan political
conduct by federal employees.
A
Such decision on our part would no more than confirm the judgment of history,
a judgment made by this country over the last century that it is in the best
interest of the country, indeed essential, that federal service should depend
upon meritorious performance rather than political service, and that the
political influence of federal employees on others and on the electoral process
should be limited. That this judgment eventuated is indisputable, and the
major steps in reaching it may be simply and briefly set down.
Early in our history, Thomas Jefferson was disturbed by the political activities
of some of those in the Executive Branch of the Government. See 10 J.
Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents 98 (1899). The heads of the
executive departments, in response to his directive, issued an order stating in
part that "[t]he right of any officer to give his vote at elections as a qualified
citizen is not meant to be restrained, nor, however given, shall it have any effect
to his prejudice; but it is expected that he will not attempt to influence the votes
of others nor take any part in the business of electioneering, that being deemed
inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution and his duties to it."
There were other voices raised in the 19th century against the mixing of
partisan politics and routine federal service. But until after the Civil War, the
spoils system under which federal employees came and went, depending upon
party service and changing administrations, rather than meritorious
performance, was much the vogue and the prevalent basis for governmental
employment and advancement. That system did not survive. Congress
authorized the President to prescribe regulations for the creation of a civil
service of federal employees in 1871, known as the Pendleton Act, that declared

Robson

256

The First Amendment

that "no person in the public service is for that reason under any obligations to
contribute to any political fund, or to render any political service" and that "no
person in said service has any right to use his official authority or influence to
coerce the political action of any person or body." That Act authorized the
President to promulgate rules to carry the Act into effect and created the Civil
Service Commission as the agency or administrator of the Act under the rules of
the President.
The original Civil Service rules were promulgated on May 7, 1883, by President
Arthur. Civil Service Rule I repeated the language of the Act that no one in the
executive service should use his official authority or influence to coerce any
other person or to interfere with an election, but went no further in restricting
the political activities of federal employees. Problems with political activity
continued to arise *** [historical discussion omitted].
This account of the efforts by the Federal Government to limit partisan political
activities by those covered by the Hatch Act should not obscure the equally
relevant fact that all 50 States have restricted the political activities of their own
employees.
B
Until now, the judgment of Congress, the Executive, and the country appears to
have been that partisan political activities by federal employees must be limited
if the Government is to operate effectively and fairly, elections are to play their
proper part in representative government, and employees themselves are to be
sufficiently free from improper influences. The restrictions so far imposed on
federal employees are not aimed at particular parties, groups, or points of view,
but apply equally to all partisan activities of the type described. They
discriminate against no racial, ethnic, or religious minorities. Nor do they seek
to control political opinions or beliefs, or to interfere with or influence anyone's
vote at the polls. ***
It seems fundamental in the first place that employees in the Executive Branch
of the Government, or those working for any of its agencies, should administer
the law in accordance with the will of Congress, rather than in accordance with
their own or the will of a political party. They are expected to enforce the law
and execute the programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or
against any political party or group or the members thereof. A major thesis of
the Hatch Act is that to serve this great end of Government - the impartial
execution of the laws - it is essential that federal employees, for example, not
take formal positions in political parties, not undertake to play substantial roles
in partisan political campaigns, and not run for office on partisan political
tickets. Forbidding activities like these will reduce the hazards to fair and
effective government.
There is another consideration in this judgment: it is not only important that
the Government and its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice, but
it is also critical that they appear to the public to be avoiding it, if confidence in
the system of representative Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous
extent.

Robson

257

The First Amendment

Another major concern of the restriction against partisan activities by federal
employees was perhaps the immediate occasion for enactment of the Hatch Act
in 1939. That was the conviction that the rapidly expanding Government work
force should not be employed to build a powerful, invincible, and perhaps
corrupt political machine. The experience of the 1936 and 1938 campaigns
convinced Congress that these dangers were sufficiently real that substantial
barriers should be raised against the party in power - or the party out of power,
for that matter - using the thousands or hundreds of thousands of federal
employees, paid for at public expense, to man its political structure and
political campaigns.
A related concern, and this remains as important as any other, was to further
serve the goal that employment and advancement in the Government service
not depend on political performance, and at the same time to make sure that
Government employees would be free from pressure and from express or tacit
invitation to vote in a certain way or perform political chores in order to curry
favor with their superiors rather than to act out their own beliefs. It may be
urged that prohibitions against coercion are sufficient protection; but for many
years the joint judgment of the Executive and Congress has been that to protect
the rights of federal employees with respect to their jobs and their political acts
and beliefs it is not enough merely to forbid one employee to attempt to
influence or coerce another. For example, at the hearings in 1972 on proposed
legislation for liberalizing the prohibition against political activity, the Chairman
of the Civil Service Commission stated that "the prohibitions against active
participation in partisan political management and partisan political campaigns
constitute the most significant safeguards against coercion . . . ." Hearings on
S. 3374 and S. 3417, supra, at 52. Perhaps Congress at some time will come to
a different view of the realities of political life and Government service; but that
is its current view of the matter, and we are not now in any position to dispute
it. Nor, in our view, does the Constitution forbid it.
Neither the right to associate nor the right to participate in political activities is
absolute in any event. ***
III
But however constitutional the proscription of identifiable partisan conduct in
understandable language may be, the District Court's judgment was that 7324
(a) (2) was both unconstitutionally vague and fatally overbroad. Appellees make
the same contentions here, but we cannot agree that the section is
unconstitutional on its face for either reason.
*** Whatever might be the difficulty with a provision against taking "active part
in political management or in political campaigns," the Act specifically provides
that the employee retains the right to vote as he chooses and to express his
opinion on political subjects and candidates. The Act exempts research and
educational activities supported by the District of Columbia or by religious,
philanthropic, or cultural organizations, 5 U.S.C. 7324 (c); and 7326 exempts
nonpartisan political activity: questions, that is, that are not identified with
national or state political parties are not covered by the Act, including issues
with respect to constitutional amendments, referendums, approval of municipal
ordinances, and the like. Moreover, the plain import of the 1940 amendment to

Robson

258

The First Amendment

the Hatch Act is that the proscription against taking an active part in the
proscribed activities is not open-ended but is limited to those rules and
proscriptions that had been developed under Civil Service Rule I up to the date
of the passage of the 1940 Act. Those rules, as refined by further adjudications
within the outer limits of the 1940 rules, were restated by the Commission in
1970 in the form of regulations specifying the conduct that would be prohibited
or permitted by 7324 and its companion sections.
We have set out these regulations in the margin. We see nothing impermissibly
vague in 5 CFR 733.122, which specifies in separate paragraphs the various
activities deemed to be prohibited by 7324 (a)(2). There might be quibbles about
the meaning of taking an "active part in managing" or about "actively
participating in . . . fund-raising" or about the meaning of becoming a "partisan"
candidate for office; but there are limitations in the English language with
respect to being both specific and manageably brief, and it seems to us that
although the prohibitions may not satisfy those intent on finding fault at any
cost, they are set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary
common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with, without sacrifice
to the public interest. "[T]he general class of offenses to which . . . [the
provisions are] directed is plainly within [their] terms, . . . [and they] will not be
struck down as vague, even though marginal cases could be put where doubts
might arise." Surely, there seemed to be little question in the minds of the
plaintiffs who brought this lawsuit as to the meaning of the law, or as to
whether or not the conduct in which they desire to engage was or was not
prohibited by the Act.
The Act permits the individual employee to "express his opinion on political
subjects and candidates," 5 U.S.C. 7324 (b); and the corresponding regulation,
5 CFR 733.111 (a) (2), privileges the employee to "[e]xpress his opinion as an
individual privately and publicly on political subjects and candidates." The
section of the regulations which purports to state the partisan acts that are
proscribed, id., 733.122, forbids in subparagraph (a) (10) the endorsement of "a
partisan candidate for public office or political party office in a political
advertisement, a broadcast, campaign literature, or similar material," and in
subparagraph (a) (12), prohibits "[a]ddressing a convention, caucus, rally, or
similar gathering of a political party in support of or in opposition to a partisan
candidate for public office or political party office." Arguably, there are problems
in meshing 733.111 (a) (2) with 733.122 (a) (10) and (12), but we think the
latter prohibitions sufficiently clearly carve out the prohibited political conduct
from the expressive activity permitted by the prior section to survive any attack
on the ground of vagueness or in the name of any of those policies that doctrine
may be deemed to further.
It is also important in this respect that the Commission has established a
procedure by which an employee in doubt about the validity of a proposed
course of conduct may seek and obtain advice from the Commission and
thereby remove any doubt there may be as to the meaning of the law, at least
insofar as the Commission itself is concerned.
*** For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is reversed.
So ordered.

The First Amendment

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE BRENNAN AND JUSTICE MARSHALL CONCUR,
DISSENTING.
The Hatch Act by 9 (a) prohibits federal employees from taking "an active part in
political management or in political campaigns." Some of the employees, whose
union is speaking for them, want
"to run in state and local elections for the school board, for city council,
for mayor";
"to write letters on political subjects to newspapers";
"to be a delegate in political convention";
"to run for an office and hold office in a political party or political club";
"to campaign for candidates for political office";
"to work at polling places in behalf of a political party."
There is no definition of what "an active part . . . in political campaigns" means.
The Act incorporates over 3,000 rulings of the Civil Service Commission
between 1886 and 1940 and many hundreds of rulings since 1940. But even
with that gloss on the Act, the critical phrases lack precision. In 1971 the
Commission published a three-volume work entitled Political Activities Reporter
which contains over 800 of its decision since the enactment of the Hatch Act.
One can learn from studying those volumes that it is not "political activity" to
march in a band during a political parade or to wear political badges or to
"participate fully in public affairs, except as prohibited by law, in a manner
which does not materially compromise his efficiency or integrity as an employee
or the neutrality, efficiency, or integrity of his agency."
That is to say, some things, like marching in a band, are clear. Others are
pregnant with ambiguity as "participate fully in public affairs, except as
prohibited by law, in a manner which does not materially compromise," etc.
Permission to "[t]ake an active part . . . in a nonpartisan election," also raises
large questions of uncertainty because one may be partisan for a person, an
issue, a candidate without feeling an identification with one political party or
the other.
*** The chilling effect of these vague and generalized prohibitions is so obvious
as not to need elaboration. That effect would not be material to the issue of
constitutionality if only the normal contours of the police power were involved.
*** [But] We deal here with a First Amendment right to speak, to propose, to
publish, to petition Government, to assemble. Time and place are obvious
limitations. Thus no one could object if employees were barred from using office
time to engage in outside activities whether political or otherwise. But it is of no
concern of Government what an employee does in his spare time, whether
religion, recreation, social work, or politics is his hobby - unless what he does
impairs efficiency or other facets of the merits of his job. Some things, some
activities do affect or may be thought to affect the employee's job performance.
But his political creed, like his religion, is irrelevant. In the areas of speech, like
religion, it is of no concern what the employee says in private to his wife or to
the public in Constitution Hall. If Government employment were only a
Robson

260

The First Amendment

"privilege," then all sorts of conditions might be attached. But it is now settled
that Government employment may not be denied or penalized "on a basis that
infringes [the employee's] constitutionally protected interests - especially, his
interest in freedom of speech." ***
Free discussion of governmental affairs is basic in our constitutional system.
Laws that trench on that area must be narrowly and precisely drawn to deal
with precise ends. Overbreadth in the area of the First Amendment has a
peculiar evil, the evil of creating chilling effects which deter the exercise of those
freedoms. ***
The present Act cannot be appropriately narrowed to meet the need for
narrowly drawn language not embracing First Amendment speech or writing
without substantial revision. That rewriting cannot be done by the Commission
because Congress refused to delegate to it authority to regulate First
Amendment rights. The proposal to do so aroused a great debate in Congress
and Senator Hatch finally submitted a substitute, saying "[i]t does away with
the question of the delegation of power."
The Commission, on a case-by-case approach, has listed 13 categories of
prohibited activities, 5 CFR 733.122 (b), starting with the catch-all "include but
are not limited to." So the Commission ends up with open-end discretion to
penalize X or not to penalize him. For example, a "permissible" activity is the
employee's right to "[e]xpress his opinion as an individual privately and publicly
on political subjects and candidates." 5 CFR 733.111 (a) (2). Yet "soliciting
votes" is prohibited. 5 CFR 733.122 (b) (7). Is an employee safe from
punishment if he expresses his opinion that candidate X is the best and
candidate Y the worst? Is that crossing the forbidden line of soliciting votes?
A nursing assistant at a veterans' hospital put an ad in a newspaper reading:
"To All My Many Friends of Poplar Bluff and Butler County I want to take this
opportunity to ask your vote and support in the election, TUESDAY, AUGUST
7th. A very special person is seeking the Democratic nomination for Sheriff. I do
not have to tell you of his qualifications, his past records stand.
"This person is my dad, Lester (Less) Massingham.
"THANK YOU
"WALLACE (WALLY) MASSINGHAM"

He was held to have violated the Act. Massingham, 1 Political Activity Reporter
792, 793 (1959).
Is a letter a permissible "expression" of views or a prohibited "solicitation?" The
Solicitor General says it is a "permissible" expression; but the Commission
ruled otherwise. For an employee who does not have the Solicitor General as
counsel great consequences flow from an innocent decision. He may lose his
job. Therefore the most prudent thing is to do nothing. Thus is self-imposed
censorship imposed on many nervous people who live on narrow economic
margins.
I would strike this provision of the law down as unconstitutional so that a new
start may be made on this old problem that confuses and restricts nearly five

	  Branti	  v.	  Finkel	  

445 U.S. 507 (1980)

	  
STEVENS, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION FOR THE COURT, IN WHICH BURGER, C. J., AND BRENNAN,
WHITE, MARSHALL, AND BLACKMUN, JJ., JOINED. STEWART, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION;
POWELL, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH REHNQUIST, J., JOINED AND IN PART I OF
WHICH STEWART, J., JOINED.

JUSTICE STEVENS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The question presented is whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the
Constitution protect an assistant public defender who is satisfactorily
performing his job from discharge solely because of his political beliefs.
Respondents, Aaron Finkel and Alan Tabakman, commenced this action in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in order to
preserve their positions as assistant public defenders in Rockland County, New
York. On January 4, 1978, on the basis of a showing that the petitioner public
defender was about to discharge them solely because they were Republicans,
the District Court entered a temporary restraining order preserving the status
quo. After hearing evidence for eight days, the District Court entered detailed
findings of fact and permanently enjoined petitioner from terminating or
attempting to terminate respondents' employment "upon the sole grounds of
their political beliefs." The Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished
memorandum opinion.
The critical facts can be summarized briefly. The Rockland County Public
Defender is appointed by the County Legislature for a term of six years. He in
turn appoints nine assistants who serve at his pleasure. The two respondents
have served as assistants since their respective appointments in March 1971
and September 1975; they are both Republicans.
Petitioner Branti's predecessor, a Republican, was appointed in 1972 by a
Republican-dominated County Legislature. By 1977, control of the legislature
had shifted to the Democrats and petitioner, also a Democrat, was appointed to
replace the incumbent when his term expired. As soon as petitioner was
formally appointed on January 3, 1978, he began executing termination notices
for six of the nine assistants then in office. Respondents were among those who
were to be terminated. With one possible exception, the nine who were to be
appointed or retained were all Democrats and were all selected by Democratic
legislators or Democratic town chairmen on a basis that had been determined
by the Democratic caucus.
The District Court found that Finkel and Tabakman had been selected for
termination solely because they were Republicans and thus did not have the
necessary Democratic sponsors***
Having concluded that respondents had been discharged solely because of their
political beliefs, the District Court held that those discharges would be

Robson

262

The First Amendment

permissible under this Court's [plurality] decision in Elrod v. Burns (1976) only
if assistant public defenders are the type of policymaking, confidential
employees who may be discharged solely on the basis of their political
affiliations. The court concluded that respondents clearly did not fall within
that category. Although recognizing that they had broad responsibilities with
respect to particular cases that were assigned to them, the court found that
respondents had "very limited, if any, responsibility" with respect to the overall
operation of the public defender's office. They did not "act as advisors or
formulate plans for the implementation of the broad goals of the office" and,
although though they made decisions in the context of specific cases, "they do
not make decisions about the orientation and operation of the office in which
they work."
The District Court also rejected the argument that the confidential character of
respondents' work justified conditioning their employment on political grounds.
The court found that they did not occupy any confidential relationship to the
policymaking process, and did not have access to confidential documents that
influenced policymaking deliberations. Rather, the only confidential information
to which they had access was the product of their attorney-client relationship
with the office's clients; to the extent that such information was shared with the
public defender, it did not relate to the formulation of office policy.
In light of these factual findings, the District Court concluded that petitioner
could not terminate respondents' employment as assistant public defenders
consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments. On appeal, a panel of
the Second Circuit affirmed, specifically holding that the District Court's
findings of fact were adequately supported by the record. That court also
expressed "no doubt" that the District Court "was correct in concluding that an
assistant public defender was neither a policymaker nor a confidential
employee." We granted certiorari and now affirm.
Petitioner advances two principal arguments for reversal: First, that the holding
in Elrod v. Burns is limited to situations in which government employees are
coerced into pledging allegiance to a political party that they would not
voluntarily support and does not apply to a simple requirement that an
employee be sponsored by the party in power; and, second, that, even if party
sponsorship is an unconstitutional condition of continued public employment
for clerks, deputies, and janitors, it is an acceptable requirement for an
assistant public defender.
I
In Elrod v. Burns the Court held that the newly elected Democratic Sheriff of
Cook County, Ill., had violated the constitutional rights of certain non-civilservice employees by discharging them "because they did not support and were
not members of the Democratic Party and had failed to obtain the sponsorship
of one of its leaders." That holding was supported by two separate opinions.
Writing for the plurality, Justice Brennan identified two separate but
interrelated reasons supporting the conclusion that the discharges were
prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. First, he analyzed the
impact of a political patronage system on freedom of belief and association.
Noting that in order to retain their jobs, the Sheriff's employees were required to

Robson

263

The First Amendment

pledge their allegiance to the Democratic Party, work for or contribute to the
party's candidates, or obtain a Democratic sponsor, he concluded that the
inevitable tendency of such a system was to coerce employees into
compromising their true beliefs. That conclusion, in his opinion, brought the
practice within the rule of cases like West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette
(1943) [Chapter 6] condemning the use of governmental power to prescribe
what the citizenry must accept as orthodox opinion.
Second, apart from the potential impact of patronage dismissals on the
formation and expression of opinion, Justice Brennan also stated that the
practice had the effect of imposing an unconstitutional condition on the receipt
of a public benefit and therefore came within the rule of cases like Perry v.
Sindermann. In support of the holding in Perry that even an employee with no
contractual right to retain his job cannot be dismissed for engaging in
constitutionally protected speech, the Court had stated:
"For at least a quarter-century, this Court has made clear that even though a
person has no `right' to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the
government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are
some reasons upon which the government may not rely. It may not deny a
benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected
interests - especially, his interest in freedom of speech. For if the government
could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech
or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and
inhibited. This would allow the government to `produce a result which [it] could
not command directly.' Such interference with constitutional rights is
impermissible. . . . . .
"Thus, the respondent's lack of a contractual or tenure `right' to re-employment
for the 1969-1970 academic year is immaterial to his free speech claim. Indeed,
twice before, this Court has specifically held that the non-renewal of a
nontenured public school teacher's one-year contract may not be predicated on
his exercise of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. ***

If the First Amendment protects a public employee from discharge based on
what he has said, it must also protect him from discharge based on what he
believes. Under this line of analysis, unless the government can demonstrate
"an overriding interest" "of vital importance," requiring that a person's private
beliefs conform to those of the hiring authority, his beliefs cannot be the sole
basis for depriving him of continued public employment.
*** Petitioner argues that Elrod v. Burns should be read to prohibit only
dismissals resulting from an employee's failure to capitulate to political
coercion. Thus, he argues that, so long as an employee is not asked to change
his political affiliation or to contribute to or work for the party's candidates, he
may be dismissed with impunity - even though he would not have been
dismissed if he had had the proper political sponsorship and even though the
sole reason for dismissing him was to replace him with a person who did have
such sponsorship. Such an interpretation would surely emasculate the
principles set forth in Elrod. While it would perhaps eliminate the more blatant
forms of coercion described in Elrod, it would not eliminate the coercion of belief
that necessarily flows from the knowledge that one must have a sponsor in the
dominant party in order to retain one's job. *** More importantly, petitioner's
interpretation would require the Court to repudiate entirely the conclusion ***

Robson

264

The First Amendment

that the First Amendment prohibits the dismissal of a public employee solely
because of his private political beliefs.
In sum, there is no requirement that dismissed employees prove that they, or
other employees, have been coerced into changing, either actually or ostensibly,
their political allegiance. To prevail in this type of an action, it was sufficient, as
Elrod holds, for respondents to prove that they were discharged "solely for the
reason that they were not affiliated with or sponsored by the Democratic Party."
II
Both opinions in Elrod recognize that party affiliation may be an acceptable
requirement for some types of government employment. Thus, if an employee's
private political beliefs would interfere with the discharge of his public duties,
his First Amendment rights may be required to yield to the State's vital interest
in maintaining governmental effectiveness and efficiency. In Elrod, it was clear
that the duties of the employees - the chief deputy of the process division of the
sheriff's office, a process server and another employee in that office, and a bailiff
and security guard at the Juvenile Court of Cook County - were not of that
character, for they were "nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential" employees.
As Justice Brennan noted in Elrod, it is not always easy to determine whether a
position is one in which political affiliation is a legitimate factor to be
considered. Under some circumstances, a position may be appropriately
considered political even though it is neither confidential nor policymaking in
character. As one obvious example, if a State's election laws require that
precincts be supervised by two election judges of different parties, a Republican
judge could be legitimately discharged solely for changing his party registration.
That conclusion would not depend on any finding that the job involved
participation in policy decisions or access to confidential information. Rather, it
would simply rest on the fact that party membership was essential to the
discharge of the employee's governmental responsibilities.
It is equally clear that party affiliation is not necessarily relevant to every
policymaking or confidential position. The coach of a state university's football
team formulates policy, but no one could seriously claim that Republicans
make better coaches than Democrats, or vice versa, no matter which party is in
control of the state government. On the other hand, it is equally clear that the
Governor of a State may appropriately believe that the official duties of various
assistants who help him write speeches, explain his views to the press, or
communicate with the legislature cannot be performed effectively unless those
persons share his political beliefs and party commitments. In sum, the ultimate
inquiry is not whether the label "policymaker" or "confidential" fits a particular
position; rather, the question is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate
that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance
of the public office involved.
Having thus framed the issue, it is manifest that the continued employment of
an assistant public defender cannot properly be conditioned upon his allegiance
to the political party in control of the county government. The primary, if not
the only, responsibility of an assistant public defender is to represent individual
citizens in controversy with the State. As we recently observed in commenting

Robson

265

The First Amendment

on the duties of counsel appointed to represent indigent defendants in federal
criminal proceedings:
"[T]he primary office performed by appointed counsel parallels the office of
privately retained counsel. Although it is true that appointed counsel serves
pursuant to statutory authorization and in furtherance of the federal interest in
insuring effective representation of criminal defendants, his duty is not to the
public at large, except in that general way. His principal responsibility is to serve
the undivided interests of his client. Indeed, an indispensable element of the
effective performance of his responsibilities is the ability to act independently of
the government and to oppose it in adversary litigation."

Thus, whatever policymaking occurs in the public defender's office must relate
to the needs of individual clients and not to any partisan political interests.
Similarly, although an assistant is bound to obtain access to confidential
information arising out of various attorney-client relationships, that information
has no bearing whatsoever on partisan political concerns. Under these
circumstances, it would undermine, rather than promote, the effective
performance of an assistant public defender's office to make his tenure
dependent on his allegiance to the dominant political party.
Accordingly, the entry of an injunction against termination of respondents'
employment on purely political grounds was appropriate and the judgment of
the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
JUSTICE POWELL, WITH WHOM JUSTICE REHNQUIST JOINS, AND WITH WHOM JUSTICE
STEWART JOINS AS TO PART I, DISSENTING.
The Court today continues the evisceration of patronage practices begun in
Elrod v. Burns (1976). With scarcely a glance at almost 200 years of American
political tradition, the Court further limits the relevance of political affiliation to
the selection and retention of public employees. Many public positions
previously filled on the basis of membership in national political parties now
must be staffed in accordance with a constitutionalized civil service standard
that will affect the employment practices of federal, state, and local
governments. Governmental hiring practices long thought to be a matter of
legislative and executive discretion now will be subjected to judicial oversight.
Today's decision is an exercise of judicial lawmaking that, as The Chief Justice
wrote in his Elrod dissent, "represents a significant intrusion into the area of
legislative and policy concerns." I dissent.
I
The Court contends that its holding is compelled by the First Amendment. In
reaching this conclusion, the Court largely ignores the substantial
governmental interests served by patronage. Patronage is a long-accepted
practice that never has been eliminated totally by civil service laws and
regulations. The flaw in the Court's opinion lies not only in its application of
First Amendment principles, but also in its promulgation of a new, and
substantially expanded, standard for determining which governmental
employees may be retained or dismissed on the basis of political affiliation.

Robson

266

The First Amendment

*** The standard articulated by the Court is framed in vague and sweeping
language certain to create vast uncertainty. Elected and appointed officials at
all levels who now receive guidance from civil service laws, no longer will know
when political affiliation is an appropriate consideration in filling a position.
Legislative bodies will not be certain whether they have the final authority to
make the delicate line-drawing decisions embodied in the civil service laws.
Prudent individuals requested to accept a public appointment must consider
whether their predecessors will threaten to oust them through legal action.
One example at the national level illustrates the nature and magnitude of the
problem created by today's holding. The President customarily has considered
political affiliation in removing and appointing United States attorneys. Given
the critical role that these key law enforcement officials play in the
administration of the Department of Justice, both Democratic and Republican
Attorneys General have concluded, not surprisingly, that they must have the
confidence and support of the United States attorneys. And political affiliation
has been used as one indicator of loyalty.
Yet, it would be difficult to say, under the Court's standard, that "partisan"
concerns properly are relevant to the performance of the duties of a United
States attorney. This Court has noted that "`[t]he office of public prosecutor is
one which must be administered with courage and independence.'"
Nevertheless, I believe that the President must have the right to consider
political affiliation when he selects top ranking Department of Justice officials.
The President and his Attorney General, not this Court, are charged with the
responsibility for enforcing the laws and administering the Department of
Justice. The Court's vague, overbroad decision may cast serious doubt on the
propriety of dismissing United States attorneys, as well as thousands of other
policymaking employees at all levels of government, because of their
membership in a national political party.
A constitutional standard that is both uncertain in its application and
impervious to legislative change will now control selection and removal of key
governmental personnel. Federal judges will now be the final arbiters as to who
federal, state, and local governments may employ. In my view, the Court is not
justified in removing decisions so essential to responsible and efficient
governance from the discretion of legislative and executive officials.
II
The Court errs not only in its selection of a standard, but more fundamentally
in its conclusion that the First Amendment prohibits the use of membership in
a national political party as a criterion for the dismissal of public employees. In
reaching this conclusion, the Court makes new law from inapplicable
precedents. The Court suggests that its decision is mandated by the principle
that governmental action may not "prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics,
nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion. . . ." Board of Education v.
Barnette (1943). The Court also relies upon the decisions in Perry v. Sindermann
(1972), and Keyishian v. Board of Regents (1967). But the propriety of patronage
was neither questioned nor addressed in those cases.
Both Keyishian and Perry involved faculty members who were dismissed from
state educational institutions because of their political views. In Keyishian, the

Robson

267

The First Amendment

Court reviewed a state statute that permitted dismissals of faculty members
from state institutions for "treasonable or seditious" utterances or acts. The
Court noted that academic freedom is "a special concern of the First
Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the
classroom." Because of the ambiguity in the statutory language, the Court held
that the law was unconstitutionally vague. The Court also held that
membership in the Communist Party could not automatically disqualify a
person from holding a faculty position in a state university. In Perry, the Court
held that the Board of Regents of a state university system could not discharge
a professor in retaliation for his exercise of free speech. In neither case did the
State suggest that the governmental positions traditionally had been regarded
as patronage positions. Thus, the Court correctly held that no substantial state
interest justified the infringement of free speech. This case presents a question
quite different from that in Keyishian and Perry.
The constitutionality of appointing or dismissing public employees on the basis
of political affiliation depends upon the governmental interests served by
patronage. No constitutional violation exists if patronage practices further
sufficiently important interests to justify tangential burdening of First
Amendment rights. See Buckley v. Valeo (1976). This inquiry cannot be resolved
by reference to First Amendment cases in which patronage was neither involved
nor discussed. Nor can the question in this case be answered in a principled
manner without identifying and weighing the governmental interest served by
patronage.
III
Patronage appointments help build stable political parties by offering rewards to
persons who assume the tasks necessary to the continued functioning of
political organizations. "As all parties are concerned with power they naturally
operate by placing members and supporters into positions of power. Thus there
is nothing derogatory in saying that a primary function of parties is patronage."
J. JUPP, POLITICAL PARTIES 25-26 (1968). The benefits of patronage to a political
organization do not derive merely from filling policymaking positions on the
basis of political affiliation. Many, if not most, of the jobs filled by patronage at
the local level may not involve policymaking functions. The use of patronage to
fill such positions builds party loyalty and avoids "splintered parties and
unrestrained factionalism [that might] do significant damage to the fabric of
government."
Until today, I would have believed that the importance of political parties was
self-evident. Political parties, dependent in many ways upon patronage, serve a
variety of substantial governmental interests. A party organization allows
political candidates to muster donations of time and money necessary to
capture the attention of the electorate. Particularly in a time of growing reliance
upon expensive television advertisements, a candidate who is neither
independently wealthy nor capable of attracting substantial contributions must
rely upon party workers to bring his message to the voters. In contests for less
visible offices, a candidate may have no efficient method of appealing to the
voters unless he enlists the efforts of persons who seek reward through the
patronage system. Insofar as the Court's decision today limits the ability of

Robson

268

The First Amendment

candidates to present their views to the electorate, our democratic process
surely is weakened.
Strong political parties also aid effective governance after election campaigns
end. Elected officials depend upon appointees who hold similar views to carry
out their policies and administer their programs. Patronage - the right to select
key personnel and to reward the party "faithful" - serves the public interest by
facilitating the implementation of policies endorsed by the electorate. The
Court's opinion casts a shadow over this time-honored element of our system. It
appears to recognize that the implementation of policy is a legitimate goal of the
patronage system and that some, but not all, policymaking employees may be
replaced on the basis of their political affiliation. But the Court does not
recognize that the implementation of policy often depends upon the cooperation
of public employees who do not hold policymaking posts. As one commentator
has written: "What the Court forgets is that, if government is to work, policy
implementation is just as important as policymaking. No matter how wise the
chief, he has to have the right Indians to transform his ideas into action, to get
the job done." The growth of the civil service system already has limited the
ability of elected politicians to effect political change. Public employees immune
to public pressure "can resist changes in policy without suffering either the loss
of their jobs or a cut in their salary." Such effects are proper when they follow
from legislative or executive decisions to withhold some jobs from the patronage
system. But the Court tips the balance between patronage and nonpatronage
positions, and, in my view, imposes unnecessary constraints upon the ability of
responsible officials to govern effectively and to carry out new policies. ***
In sum, the effect of the Court's decision will be to decrease the accountability
and denigrate the role of our national political parties. This decision comes at a
time when an increasing number of observers question whether our national
political parties can continue to operate effectively. Broad-based political parties
supply an essential coherence and flexibility to the American political scene.
They serve as coalitions of different interests that combine to seek national
goals. The decline of party strength inevitably will enhance the influence of
special interest groups whose only concern all too often is how a political
candidate votes on a single issue. The quality of political debate, and indeed the
capacity of government to function in the national interest, suffer when
candidates and officeholders are forced to be more responsive to the narrow
concerns of unrepresentative special interest groups than to overarching issues
of domestic and foreign policy. The Court ignores the substantial governmental
interests served by reasonable patronage. In my view, its decision will seriously
hamper the functioning of stable political parties.
IV
The facts of this case also demonstrate that the Court's decision well may
impair the right of local voters to structure their government. Consideration of
the form of local government in Rockland County, N. Y., demonstrates the
antidemocratic effect of the Court's decision.
The voters of the county elect a legislative body. Among the responsibilities that
the voters give to the legislature is the selection of a county public defender. In
1972, when the county voters elected a Republican majority in the legislature, a

Robson

269

The First Amendment

Republican was selected as Public Defender. The Public Defender retained one
respondent and appointed the other as Assistant Public Defenders. Not
surprisingly, both respondents are Republicans. In 1976, the voters elected a
majority of Democrats to the legislature. The Democratic majority, in turn,
selected a Democratic Public Defender who replaced both respondents with
Assistant Public Defenders approved by the Democratic legislators.
The voters of Rockland County are free to elect their public defender and
assistant public defenders instead of delegating their selection to elected and
appointed officials. Certainly the Court's holding today would not preclude the
voters, the ultimate "hiring authority," from choosing both public defenders and
their assistants by party membership. The voters' choice of public officials on
the basis of political affiliation is not yet viewed as an inhibition of speech; it is
democracy. Nor may any incumbent contend seriously that the voters' decision
not to re-elect him because of his political views is an impermissible
infringement upon his right of free speech or affiliation. In other words, the
operation of democratic government depends upon the selection of elected
officials on precisely the basis rejected by the Court today.
Although the voters of Rockland County could have elected both the public
defender and his assistants, they have given their legislators a representative
proxy to appoint the public defender. And they have delegated to the public
defender the power to choose his assistants. Presumably the voters have
adopted this course in order to facilitate more effective representative
government. Of course, the voters could have instituted a civil service system
that would preclude the selection of either the public defender or his assistants
on the basis of political affiliation. But the continuation of the present system
reflects the electorate's decision to select certain public employees on the basis
of political affiliation.
The Court's decision today thus limits the ability of the voters of a county to
structure their democratic government in the way that they please. Now those
voters must elect both the public defender and his assistants if they are to fill
governmental positions on a partisan basis. Because voters certainly may elect
governmental officials on the basis of party ties, it is difficult to perceive a
constitutional reason for prohibiting them from delegating that same authority
to legislators and appointed officials.
V
The benefits of political patronage and the freedom of voters to structure their
representative government are substantial governmental interests that justify
the selection of the assistant public defenders of Rockland County on the basis
of political affiliation. The decision to place certain governmental positions
within a civil service system is a sensitive political judgment that should be left
to the voters and to elected representatives of the people. But the Court's
constitutional holding today displaces political responsibility with judicial fiat.
In my view, the First Amendment does not incorporate a national civil service
system. I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Notes	  	  
1.
In Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois, 497 U.S. 62 (1990), a closely
divided Court extended Branti and Elrod to a range of public employment
decisions. The Governor of Illinois had issued an executive order
instituting a “hiring freeze” absent the Governor’s express permission.
The Governor then allegedly used that permission to operate a
“patronage system” in that Republican party members were routinely
hired, allowed to transfer, or promoted, while non-Republican party
members were not. Writing for the Court, Justice Brennan began his
opinion thusly:
To the victor belong only those spoils that may be constitutionally obtained.
Elrod v. Burns (1976), and Branti v. Finkel (1980) decided that the First
Amendment forbids government officials to discharge or threaten to discharge
public employees solely for not being supporters of the political party in power,
unless party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position involved.
Today we are asked to decide the constitutionality of several related political
patronage practices — whether promotion, transfer, recall, and hiring decisions
involving low-level public employees may be constitutionally based on party
affiliation and support. We hold that they may not.

The dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Scalia, and joined by Chief
Justice Rehnquist, as well as Justices Kennedy and (in part) O'Connor,
began:
Today the Court establishes the constitutional principle that party membership
is not a permissible factor in the dispensation of government jobs, except those
jobs for the performance of which party affiliation is an "appropriate
requirement." It is hard to say precisely (or even generally) what that exception
means, but if there is any category of jobs for whose performance party
affiliation is not an appropriate requirement, it is the job of being a judge, where
partisanship is not only unneeded but positively undesirable. It is, however, rare
that a federal administration of one party will appoint a judge from another
party. And it has always been rare. See Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137
(1803). Thus, the new principle that the Court today announces will be enforced
by a corps of judges (the Members of this Court included) who overwhelmingly
owe their office to its violation. Something must be wrong here, and I suggest it
is the Court.

2.
In O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake, 518 U.S. 712 (1996),
the Court held that the protections of Elrod and Branti extend to an
instance where government retaliates against a contractor, or a regular
provider of services, for the exercise of rights of political association or
the expression of political allegiance.
3.
Do you think there should be a distinction between prosecutors
and public defenders regarding the rule of Elrod and Branti?
4.
How do you see the relationship between The Hatch Act and
patronage?

BRENNAN, STEWART, AND FORTAS, JJ., JOINED. DOUGLAS, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION IN
WHICH BLACK, J., JOINED. WHITE, J., FILED AN OPINION CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN
PART.

JUSTICE MARSHALL DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Appellant Marvin L. Pickering, a teacher in Township High School District 205,
Will County, Illinois, was dismissed from his position by the appellee Board of
Education for sending a letter to a local newspaper in connection with a
recently proposed tax increase that was critical of the way in which the Board
and the district superintendent of schools had handled past proposals to raise
new revenue for the schools. Appellant's dismissal resulted from a
determination by the Board, after a full hearing, that the publication of the
letter was 'detrimental to the efficient operation and administration of the
schools of the district' and hence, under the relevant Illinois statute,
Ill.Rev.Stat., c. 122, § 10—22.4(1963), that 'interests of the schools require(d)
(his dismissal).'
Appellant's claim that his writing of the letter was protected by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments was rejected. Appellant then sought review of the
Board's action in the Circuit Court of Will County, which affirmed his dismissal
on the ground that the determination that appellant's letter was detrimental to
the interests of the school system was supported by substantial evidence and
that the interests of the schools overruled appellant's First Amendment rights.
On appeal, the Supreme Court of Illinois, two Justices dissenting, affirmed the
judgment of the Circuit Court. We noted probable jurisdiction of appellant's
claim that the Illinois statute permitting his dismissal on the facts of this case
was unconstitutional as applied under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
For the reasons detailed below we agree that appellant's rights to freedom of
speech were violated and we reverse.
I.
In February of 1961 the appellee Board of Education asked the voters of the
school district to approve a bond issue to raise $4,875,000 to erect two new
schools. The proposal was defeated. Then, in December of 1961, the Board
submitted another bond proposal to the voters which called for the raising of
$5,500,000 to build two new schools. This second proposal passed and the
schools were built with the money raised by the bond sales. In May of 1964 a
proposed increase in the tax rate to be used for educational purposes was

Robson

272

The First Amendment

submitted to the voters by the Board and was defeated. Finally, on September
19, 1964, a second proposal to increase the tax rate was submitted by the
Board and was likewise defeated. It was in connection with this last proposal of
the School Board that appellant wrote the letter to the editor (which we
reproduce in an Appendix to this opinion) that resulted in his dismissal.
Prior to the vote on the second tax increase proposal a variety of articles
attributed to the District 205 Teachers' Organization appeared in the local
paper. These articles urged passage of the tax increase and stated that failure
to pass the increase would result in a decline in the quality of education
afforded children in the district's schools. A letter from the superintendent of
schools making the same point was published in the paper two days before the
election and submitted to the voters in mimeographed form the following day. It
was in response to the foregoing material, together with the failure of the tax
increase to pass, that appellant submitted the letter in question to the editor of
the local paper.
The letter constituted, basically, an attack on the School Board's handling of
the 1961 bond issue proposals and its subsequent allocation of financial
resources between the schools' educational and athletic programs. It also
charged the superintendent of schools with attempting to prevent teachers in
the district from opposing or criticizing the proposed bond issue.
The Board dismissed Pickering for writing and publishing the letter. Pursuant
to Illinois law, the Board was then required to hold a hearing on the dismissal.
At the hearing the Board charged that numerous statements in the letter were
false and that the publication of the statements unjustifiably impugned the
'motives, honesty, integrity, truthfulness, responsibility and competence' of
both the Board and the school administration. The Board also charged that the
false statements damaged the professional reputations of its members and of
the school administrators, would be disruptive of faculty discipline, and would
tend to foment 'controversy, conflict and dissension' among teachers,
administrators, the Board of Education, and the residents of the district.
Testimony was introduced from a variety of witnesses on the truth or falsity of
the particular statements in the letter with which the Board took issue. The
Board found the statements to be false as charged. No evidence was introduced
at any point in the proceedings as to the effect of the publication of the letter on
the community as a whole or on the administration of the school system in
particular, and no specific findings along these lines were made.
The Illinois courts reviewed the proceedings solely to determine whether the
Board's findings were supported by substantial evidence and whether, on the
facts as found, the Board could reasonably conclude that appellant's
publication of the letter was 'detrimental to the best interests of the schools.'
Pickering's claim that his letter was protected by the First Amendment was
rejected on the ground that his acceptance of a teaching position in the public
schools obliged him to refrain from making statements about the operation of
the schools 'which in the absence of such position he would have an undoubted
right to engage in.' It is not altogether clear whether the Illinois Supreme Court
held that the First Amendment had no applicability to appellant's dismissal for
writing the letter in question or whether it determined that the particular
statements made in the letter were not entitled to First Amendment protection.

Robson

273

The First Amendment

In any event, it clearly rejected Pickering's claim that, on the facts of this case,
he could not constitutionally be dismissed from his teaching position.
II.
To the extent that the Illinois Supreme Court's opinion may be read to suggest
that teachers may constitutionally be compelled to relinquish the First
Amendment rights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on
matters of public interest in connection with the operation of the public schools
in which they work, it proceeds on a premise that has been unequivocally
rejected in numerous prior decisions of this Court. “(T)he theory that public
employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any
conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.”
Keyishian v. Board of Regents (1967). At the same time it cannot be gainsaid
that the State has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its
employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with
regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general. The problem in any case is
to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in
commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an
employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through
its employees.
III.
The Board contends that 'the teacher by virtue of his public employment has a
duty of loyalty to support his superiors in attaining the generally accepted goals
of education and that, if he must speak out publicly, he should do so factually
and accurately, commensurate with his education and experience.' Appellant,
on the other hand, argues that the test applicable to defamatory statements
directed against public officials by persons having no occupational relationship
with them, namely, that statements to be legally actionable must be made 'with
knowledge that (they were) * * * false or with reckless disregard of whether (they
were) * * * false or not,' New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), should also be
applied to public statements made by teachers. Because of the enormous
variety of fact situations in which critical statements by teachers and other
public employees may be thought by their superiors, against whom the
statements are directed to furnish grounds for dismissal, we do not deem it
either appropriate or feasible to attempt to lay down a general standard against
which all such statements may be judged. However, in the course of evaluating
the conflicting claims of First Amendment protection and the need for orderly
school administration in the context of this case, we shall indicate some of the
general lines along which an analysis of the controlling interests should run.
An examination of the statements in appellant's letter objected to by the Board
reveals that they, like the letter as a whole, consist essentially of criticism of the
Board's allocation of school funds between educational and athletic programs,
and of both the Board's and the superintendent's methods of informing, or
preventing the informing of, the district's taxpayers of the real reasons why
additional tax revenues were being sought for the schools. The statements are
in no way directed towards any person with whom appellant would normally be
in contact in the course of his daily work as a teacher. Thus no question of
maintaining either discipline by immediate superiors or harmony among

Robson

274

The First Amendment

coworkers is presented here. Appellant's employment relationships with the
Board and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with the superintendent are not the
kind of close working relationships for which it can persuasively be claimed that
personal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their proper functioning.
Accordingly, to the extent that the Board's position here can be taken to suggest
that even comments on matters of public concern that are substantially correct,
such as statements (1)—(4) of appellant's letter, see Appendix, infra, may
furnish grounds for dismissal if they are sufficiently critical in tone, we
unequivocally reject it.
We next consider the statements in appellant's letter which we agree to be false.
The Board's original charges included allegations that the publication of the
letter damaged the professional reputations of the Board and the
superintendent and would foment controversy and conflict among the Board,
teachers, administrators, and the residents of the district. However, no evidence
to support these allegations was introduced at the hearing. So far as the record
reveals, Pickering's letter was greeted by everyone but its main target, the Board,
with massive apathy and total disbelief. The Board must, therefore, have
decided, perhaps by analogy with the law of libel, that the statements were per
se harmful to the operation of the schools.
However, the only way in which the Board could conclude, absent any evidence
of the actual effect of the letter, that the statements contained therein were per
se detrimental to the interest of the schools was to equate the Board members'
own interests with that of the schools. Certainly an accusation that too much
money is being spent on athletics by the administrators of the school system
(which is precisely the import of that portion of appellant's letter containing the
statements that we have found to be false, see Appendix, infra) cannot
reasonably be regarded as per se detrimental to the district's schools. Such an
accusation reflects rather a difference of opinion between Pickering and the
Board as to the preferable manner of operating the school system, a difference
of opinion that clearly concerns an issue of general public interest.
In addition, the fact that particular illustrations of the Board's claimed
undesirable emphasis on athletic programs are false would not normally have
any necessary impact on the actual operation of the schools, beyond its
tendency to anger the Board. For example, Pickering's letter was written after
the defeat at the polls of the second proposed tax increase. It could, therefore,
have had no effect on the ability of the school district to raise necessary revenue,
since there was no showing that there was any proposal to increase taxes
pending when the letter was written.
More importantly, the question whether a school system requires additional
funds is a matter of legitimate public concern on which the judgment of the
school administration, including the School Board, cannot, in a society that
leaves such questions to popular vote, be taken as conclusive. On such a
question free and open debate is vital to informed decision-making by the
electorate. Teachers are, as a class, the members of a community most likely to
have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the operations
of the schools should be spent. Accordingly, it is essential that they be able to
speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal.

Robson

275

The First Amendment

In addition, the amounts expended on athletics which Pickering reported
erroneously were matters of public record on which his position as a teacher in
the district did not qualify him to speak with any greater authority than any
other taxpayer. The Board could easily have rebutted appellant's errors by
publishing the accurate figures itself, either via a letter to the same newspaper
or otherwise. We are thus not presented with a situation in which a teacher has
carelessly made false statements about matters so closely related to the day-today operations of the schools that any harmful impact on the public would be
difficult to counter because of the teacher's presumed greater access to the real
facts. Accordingly, we have no occasion to consider at this time whether under
such circumstances a school board could reasonably require that a teacher
make substantial efforts to verify the accuracy of his charges before publishing
them.
What we do have before us is a case in which a teacher has made erroneous
public statements upon issues then currently the subject of public attention,
which are critical of his ultimate employer but which are neither shown nor can
be presumed to have in any way either impeded the teacher's proper
performance of his daily duties in the classroom or to have interfered with the
regular operation of the schools generally. In these circumstances we conclude
that the interest of the school administration in limiting teachers' opportunities
to contribute to public debate is not significantly greater than its interest in
limiting a similar contribution by any member of the general public.
IV.
The public interest in having free and unhindered debate on matters of public
importance—the core value of the Free Speech Clause of the First
Amendment—is so great that it has been held that a State cannot authorize the
recovery of damages by a public official for defamatory statements directed at
him except when such statements are shown to have been made either with
knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity.
New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. The same test has been applied to suits for
invasion of privacy based on false statements where a 'matter of public interest'
is involved. Time, Inc. v. Hill (1967) . It is therefore perfectly clear that, were
appellant a member of the general public, the State's power to afford the
appellee Board of Education or its members any legal right to sue him for
writing the letter at issue here would be limited by the requirement that the
letter be judged by the standard laid down in New York Times.
This Court has also indicated, in more general terms, that statements by public
officials on matters of public concern must be accorded First Amendment
protection despite the fact that the statements are directed at their nominal
superiors. ***
While criminal sanctions and damage awards have a somewhat different impact
on the exercise of the right to freedom of speech from dismissal from
employment, it is apparent that the threat of dismissal from public employment
is nonetheless a potent means of inhibiting speech. We have already noted our
disinclination to make an across-the-board equation of dismissal from public
employment for remarks critical of superiors with awarding damages in a libel
suit by a public official for similar criticism. However, in a case such as the

Robson

276

The First Amendment

present one, in which the fact of employment is only tangentially and
insubstantially involved in the subject matter of the public communication
made by a teacher, we conclude that it is necessary to regard the teacher as the
member of the general public he seeks to be.
In sum, we hold that, in a case such as this, absent proof of false statements
knowingly or recklessly made by him, a teacher's exercise of his right to speak
on issues of public importance may not furnish the basis for his dismissal from
public employment. Since no such showing has been made in this case
regarding appellant's letter, see Appendix, infra, his dismissal for writing it
cannot be upheld and the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court must,
accordingly, be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.
Judgment reversed and case remanded with directions.

APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
* * * Graphic Newspapers, Inc. Thursday, September 24, 1964, Page 4
Dear Editor:
I enjoyed reading the back issues of your paper which you loaned to me.
Perhaps others would enjoy reading them in order to see just how far the two
new high schools have deviated from the original promises by the Board of
Education. First, let me state that I am referring to the February thru November,
1961 issues of your paper, so that it can be checked.
One statement in your paper declared that swimming pools, athletic fields, and
auditoriums had been left out of the program. They may have been left out but
they got put back in very quickly because Lockport West has both an
auditorium and athletic field. In fact, Lockport West has a better athletic field
than Lockport Central. It has a track that isn't quite regulation distance even
though the board spent a few thousand dollars on it. Whose fault is that? Oh, I
forgot, it wasn't supposed to be there in the first place. It must have fallen out of
the sky. Such responsibility has been touched on in other letters but it seems
one just can't help noticing it. I am not saying the school shouldn't have these
facilities, because I think they should, but promises are promises, or are they?
Since there seems to be a problem getting all the facts to the voter on the twice
defeated bond issue, many letters have been written to this paper and probably
more will follow, I feel I must say something about the letters and their writers.
Many of these letters did not give the whole story. Letters by your Board and
Administration have stated that teachers' salaries total $1,297,746 for one year.
Now that must have been the total payroll, otherwise the teachers would be
getting $10,000 a year. I teach at the high school and I know this just isn't the
case. However, this shows their 'stop at nothing' attitude. To illustrate further,
do you know that the superintendent told the teachers, and I quote, 'Any
teacher that opposes the referendum should be prepared for the consequences.'
I think this gets at the reason we have problems passing bond issues. Threats

Robson

277

The First Amendment

take something away; these are insults to voters in a free society. We should try
to sell a program on its merits, if it has any.
Remember those letters entitled 'District 205 Teachers Speak,' I think the voters
should know that those letters have been written and agreed to by only five or
six teachers, not 98% of the teachers in the high school. In fact, many teachers
didn't even know who was writing them. Did you know that those letters had to
have the approval of the superintendent before they could be put in the paper?
That's the kind of totalitarianism teachers live in at the high school, and your
children go to school in.
In last week's paper, the letter written by a few uninformed teachers threatened
to close the school cafeteria and fire its personnel. This is ridiculous and insults
the intelligence of the voter because properly managed school cafeterias do not
cost the school district any money. If the cafeteria is losing money, then the
board should not be packing free lunches for athletes on days of athletic
contests. Whatever the case, the taxpayer's child should only have to pay about
30¢ for his lunch instead of 35¢ to pay for free lunches for the athletes.
In a reply to this letter your Board of Administration will probably state that
these lunches are paid for from receipts from the games. But $20,000 in receipts
doesn't pay for the $200,000 a year they have been spending on varsity sports
while neglecting the wants of teachers.
You see we don't need an increase in the transportation tax unless the voters
want to keep paying $50,000 or more a year to transport athletes home after
practice and to away games, etc. Rest of the $200,000 is made up in coaches'
salaries, athletic directors' salaries, baseball pitching machines, sodded football
fields, and thousands of dollars for other sports equipment.
These things are all right, provided we have enough money for them. To sod
football fields on borrowed money and then not be able to pay teachers' salaries
is getting the cart before the horse.
If these things aren't enough for you, look at East High. No doors on many of the
classrooms, a plant room without any sunlight, no water in a first aid treatment
room, are just a few of many things. The taxpayers were really taken to the
cleaners. A part of the sidewalk in front of the building has already collapsed.
Maybe Mr. Hess would be interested to know that we need blinds on the
windows in that building also.
Once again, the board must have forgotten they were going to spend $3,200,000
on the West building and $2,300,000 on the East building.
As I see it, the bond issue is a fight between the Board of Education that is
trying to push tax-supported athletics down our throats with education, and a
public that has mixed emotions about both of these items because they feel they
are already paying enough taxes, and simply don't know whom to trust with any
more tax money.
I must sign this letter as a citizen, taxpayer and voter, not as a teacher, since
that freedom has been taken from the teachers by the administration. Do you
really know what goes on behind those stone walls at the high school?
Respectfully,
Marvin L. Pickering

Mt.	  Healthy	  City	  Board	  of	  Ed.	  v.	  Doyle	  	  
429 U.S. 274 (1977)

REHNQUIST, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION FOR A UNANIMOUS COURT.
Respondent Doyle sued petitioner Mt. Healthy Board of Education in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Doyle claimed that the
Board's refusal to renew his contract in 1971 violated his rights under the First
and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. After a bench
trial the District Court held that Doyle was entitled to reinstatement with
backpay. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the judgment, and
we granted the Board's petition for certiorari to consider an admixture of
jurisdictional and constitutional claims.
I -III
[omitted]
IV
Having concluded that respondent's complaint sufficiently pleaded jurisdiction
under 28 U.S.C. 1331, that the Board has failed to preserve the issue whether
that complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted against the
Board, and that the Board is not immune from suit under the Eleventh
Amendment, we now proceed to consider the merits of respondent's claim
under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Doyle was first employed by the Board in 1966. He worked under one-year
contracts for the first three years, and under a two-year contract from 1969 to
1971. In 1969 he was elected president of the Teachers' Association, in which
position he worked to expand the subjects of direct negotiation between the
Association and the Board of Education. During Doyle's one-year term as
president of the Association, and during the succeeding year when he served on
its executive committee, there was apparently some tension in relations
between the Board and the Association.
Beginning early in 1970, Doyle was involved in several incidents not directly
connected with his role in the Teachers' Association. In one instance, he
engaged in an argument with another teacher which culminated in the other
teacher's slapping him. Doyle subsequently refused to accept an apology and
insisted upon some punishment for the other teacher. His persistence in the
matter resulted in the suspension of both teachers for one day, which was
followed by a walkout by a number of other teachers, which in turn resulted in
the lifting of the suspensions.
On other occasions, Doyle got into an argument with employees of the school
cafeteria over the amount of spaghetti which had been served him; referred to
students, in connection with a disciplinary complaint, as "sons of bitches"; and
made an obscene gesture to two girls in connection with their failure to obey
commands made in his capacity as cafeteria supervisor. Chronologically the
last in the series of incidents which respondent was involved in during his
employment by the Board was a telephone call by him to a local radio station. It

Robson

279

The First Amendment

was the Board's consideration of this incident which the court below found to
be a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
In February 1971, the principal circulated to various teachers a memorandum
relating to teacher dress and appearance, which was apparently prompted by
the view of some in the administration that there was a relationship between
teacher appearance and public support for bond issues. Doyle's response to the
receipt of the memorandum - on a subject which he apparently understood was
to be settled by joint teacher-administration action - was to convey the
substance of the memorandum to a disc jockey at WSAI, a Cincinnati radio
station, who promptly announced the adoption of the dress code as a news item.
Doyle subsequently apologized to the principal, conceding that he should have
made some prior communication of his criticism to the school administration.
Approximately one month later the superintendent made his customary annual
recommendations to the Board as to the rehiring of nontenured teachers. He
recommended that Doyle not be rehired. The same recommendation was made
with respect to nine other teachers in the district, and in all instances,
including Doyle's, the recommendation was adopted by the Board. Shortly after
being notified of this decision, respondent requested a statement of reasons for
the Board's actions. He received a statement citing "a notable lack of tact in
handling professional matters which leaves much doubt as to your sincerity in
establishing good school relationships." That general statement was followed by
references to the radio station incident and to the obscene-gesture incident.
The District Court found that all of these incidents had in fact occurred. It
concluded that respondent Doyle's telephone call to the radio station was
"clearly protected by the First Amendment," and that because it had played a
"substantial part" in the decision of the Board not to renew Doyle's employment,
he was entitled to reinstatement with backpay. The District Court did not
expressly state what test it was applying in determining that the incident in
question involved conduct protected by the First Amendment, but simply held
that the communication to the radio station was such conduct. The Court of
Appeals affirmed in a brief per curiam opinion.
Doyle's claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments are not defeated by
the fact that he did not have tenure. Even though he could have been
discharged for no reason whatever, and had no constitutional right to a hearing
prior to the decision not to rehire him, Board of Regents v. Roth (1972), he may
nonetheless establish a claim to reinstatement if the decision not to rehire him
was made by reason of his exercise of constitutionally protected First
Amendment freedoms. Perry v. Sindermann (1972).
That question of whether speech of a government employee is constitutionally
protected expression necessarily entails striking "a balance between the
interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public
concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the
efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees." Pickering v.
Board of Education (1968). There is no suggestion by the Board that Doyle
violated any established policy, or that its reaction to his communication to the
radio station was anything more than an ad hoc response to Doyle's action in
making the memorandum public. We therefore accept the District Court's

Robson

280

The First Amendment

finding that the communication was protected by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. We are not, however, entirely in agreement with that court's
manner of reasoning from this finding to the conclusion that Doyle is entitled to
reinstatement with backpay.
The District Court made the following "conclusions" on this aspect of the case:
"1) If a non-permissible reason, e. g., exercise of First Amendment rights, played
a substantial part in the decision not to renew - even in the face of other
permissible grounds - the decision may not stand (citations omitted).
"2) A non-permissible reason did play a substantial part. That is clear from the
letter of the Superintendent immediately following the Board's decision, which
stated two reasons - the one, the conversation with the radio station clearly
protected by the First Amendment. A court may not engage in any limitation of
First Amendment rights based on `tact' - that is not to say that the `tactfulness'
is irrelevant to other issues in this case."

At the same time, though, it stated that
"[i]n fact, as this Court sees it and finds, both the Board and the Superintendent
were faced with a situation in which there did exist in fact reason . . .
independent of any First Amendment rights or exercise thereof, to not extend
tenure."

Since respondent Doyle had no tenure, and there was therefore not even a
state-law requirement of "cause" or "reason" before a decision could be made
not to renew his employment, it is not clear what the District Court meant by
this latter statement. Clearly the Board legally could have dismissed respondent
had the radio station incident never come to its attention. One plausible
meaning of the court's statement is that the Board and the Superintendent not
only could, but in fact would have reached that decision had not the
constitutionally protected incident of the telephone call to the radio station
occurred. We are thus brought to the issue whether, even if that were the case,
the fact that the protected conduct played a "substantial part" in the actual
decision not to renew would necessarily amount to a constitutional violation
justifying remedial action. We think that it would not.
A rule of causation which focuses solely on whether protected conduct played a
part, "substantial" or otherwise, in a decision not to rehire, could place an
employee in a better position as a result of the exercise of constitutionally
protected conduct than he would have occupied had he done nothing. The
difficulty with the rule enunciated by the District Court is that it would require
reinstatement in cases where a dramatic and perhaps abrasive incident is
inevitably on the minds of those responsible for the decision to rehire, and does
indeed play a part in that decision - even if the same decision would have been
reached had the incident not occurred. The constitutional principle at stake is
sufficiently vindicated if such an employee is placed in no worse a position than
if he had not engaged in the conduct. A borderline or marginal candidate
should not have the employment question resolved against him because of
constitutionally protected conduct. But that same candidate ought not to be
able, by engaging in such conduct, to prevent his employer from assessing his
performance record and reaching a decision not to rehire on the basis of that
record, simply because the protected conduct makes the employer more certain
of the correctness of its decision.

Robson

281

The First Amendment

This is especially true where, as the District Court observed was the case here,
the current decision to rehire will accord "tenure." The long-term consequences
of an award of tenure are of great moment both to the employee and to the
employer. They are too significant for us to hold that the Board in this case
would be precluded, because it considered constitutionally protected conduct in
deciding not to rehire Doyle, from attempting to prove to a trier of fact that quite
apart from such conduct Doyle's record was such that he would not have been
rehired in any event.
In other areas of constitutional law, this Court has found it necessary to
formulate a test of causation which distinguishes between a result caused by a
constitutional violation and one not so caused. We think those are instructive
in formulating the test to be applied here.
In Lyons v. Oklahoma (1944), the Court held that even though the first
confession given by a defendant had been involuntary, the Fourteenth
Amendment did not prevent the State from using a second confession obtained
12 hours later if the coercion surrounding the first confession had been
sufficiently dissipated as to make the second confession voluntary. In Wong Sun
v. United States (1963), the Court was willing to assume that a defendant's
arrest had been unlawful, but held that "the connection between the arrest and
the statement [given several days later] had `become so attenuated as to
dissipate the taint.' *** While the type of causation on which the taint cases
turn may differ somewhat from that which we apply here, those cases do
suggest that the proper test to apply in the present context is one which
likewise protects against the invasion of constitutional rights without
commanding undesirable consequences not necessary to the assurance of those
rights.
Initially, in this case, the burden was properly placed upon respondent to show
that his conduct was constitutionally protected, and that this conduct was a
"substantial factor" - or, to put it in other words, that it was a "motivating
factor" in the Board's decision not to rehire him. Respondent having carried
that burden, however, the District Court should have gone on to determine
whether the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would
have reached the same decision as to respondent's re-employment even in the
absence of the protected conduct.
We cannot tell from the District Court opinion and conclusions, nor from the
opinion of the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of the District Court,
what conclusion those courts would have reached had they applied this test.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore vacated, and the case
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
So ordered.

The First Amendment

Notes	  	  
1.
Importantly, Pickering rejects the notion that public employees
abandon their First Amendment rights as a condition of public
employment. The Court relies on Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of
State of N. Y. (1967), decided the previous year, in which the Court held
unconstitutional a “loyalty oath” that was a prerequisite of continued
state university employment. Each plaintiff had refused to sign a
“Feinberg Certificate,” that “he was not a Communist, and that if he had
ever been a Communist, he had communicated that fact to the President
of the State University of New York.” Writing for the Court in Keyishian,
Justice Brennan opined:
Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, which is of
transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned. That
freedom is therefore a special concern of the First Amendment, which does not
tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom. ‘The vigilant
protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the
community of American schools.’ The classroom is peculiarly the ‘marketplace of
ideas.’ The Nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure
to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth ‘out of a multitude of
tongues, (rather) than through any kind of authoritative selection.’

How is this notion of “academic freedom” in tension with the holding in
Pickering itself?
2.
Justice White, who concurs in part and dissents in part in
Pickering differed with the Court on whether false statements would be
protected:
Deliberate or reckless falsehoods serve no
no protection under that Amendment. ***
without violation of the First Amendment
false statements regardless of their harmful

First Amendment ends and deserve
As I see it, a teacher may be fired
for knowingly or recklessly making
impact on the schools.

Do White’s concerns survive United States v. Alvarez?
3.
Articulate the “Pickering test” which remains valid doctrine. Why is
it called a “balancing” test?
4.
Articulate the “Mt. Healthy test” which also remains valid doctrine.
When does it apply?
5.
While doctrinal cross-fertilization is not unusual, is the other area
of constitutional law that the Court finds “instructive” one that is
predictable? Have you encountered a test similar to Mt. Healthy in other
areas of law?

Givhan	  v.	  Western	  Line	  Consol.	  School	  Dist.	  
439 U.S. 410 (1979)

REHNQUIST, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION FOR A UNANIMOUS COURT. STEVENS, J., FILED A
CONCURRING OPINION.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Petitioner Bessie Givhan was dismissed from her employment as a junior high
English teacher at the end of the 1970-1971 school year. At the time of
petitioner's termination, respondent Western Line Consolidated School District
was the subject of a desegregation order entered by the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. Petitioner filed a complaint in
intervention in the desegregation action, seeking reinstatement on the dual
grounds that nonrenewal of her contract violated the rule laid down by the
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit *** and infringed her right of free speech
secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States
Constitution. In an effort to show that its decision was justified, respondent
School District introduced evidence of, among other things, a series of private
encounters between petitioner and the school principal in which petitioner
allegedly made "petty and unreasonable demands" in a manner variously
described by the principal as "insulting," "hostile," "loud," and "arrogant." After
a two-day bench trial, the District Court held that petitioner's termination had
violated the First Amendment. Finding that petitioner had made "demands" on
but two occasions and that those demands "were neither ‘petty’ nor
‘unreasonable,’ insomuch as all the complaints in question involved
employment policies and practices at [the] school which [petitioner] conceived to
be racially discriminatory in purpose or effect," the District Court concluded
that "the primary reason for the school district's failure to renew [petitioner's]
contract was her criticism of the policies and practices of the school district,
especially the school to which she was assigned to teach." Accordingly, the
District Court held that the dismissal violated petitioner's First Amendment
rights, as enunciated in Perry v. Sindermann (1972), and Pickering v. Board of
Education (1968), and ordered her reinstatement.
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. Although it found the
District Court's findings not clearly erroneous, the Court of Appeals concluded
that because petitioner had privately expressed her complaints and opinions to
the principal, her expression was not protected under the First Amendment.
Support for this proposition was thought to be derived from Pickering, Perry,
and Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle (1977), which were found to contain

Robson

284

The First Amendment

"[t]he strong implication . . . that private expression by a public employee is not
constitutionally protected." The Court of Appeals also concluded that there is no
constitutional right to "press even `good' ideas on an unwilling recipient," saying
that to afford public employees the right to such private expression "would in
effect force school principals to be ombudsmen, for damnable as well as
laudable expressions." We are unable to agree that private expression of one's
views is beyond constitutional protection, and therefore reverse the Court of
Appeals' judgment and remand the case so that it may consider the contentions
of the parties freed from this erroneous view of the First Amendment.
This Court's decisions in Pickering, Perry, and Mt. Healthy do not support the
conclusion that a public employee forfeits his protection against governmental
abridgment of freedom of speech if he decides to express his views privately
rather than publicly. While those cases each arose in the context of a public
employee's public expression, the rule to be derived from them is not dependent
on that largely coincidental fact. ***
The First Amendment forbids abridgment of the "freedom of speech." Neither
the Amendment itself nor our decisions indicate that this freedom is lost to the
public employee who arranges to communicate privately with his employer
rather than to spread his views before the public. We decline to adopt such a
view of the First Amendment.
*** Since this case was tried before Mt. Healthy was decided, it is not surprising
that respondents did not attempt to prove in the District Court that the decision
not to rehire petitioner would have been made even absent consideration of her
"demands." Thus, the case came to the Court of Appeals in very much the same
posture as Mt. Healthy was presented to this Court. And while the District
Court found that petitioner's "criticism" was the "primary" reason for the School
District's failure to rehire her, it did not find that she would have been rehired
but for her criticism. Respondents' Mt. Healthy claim called for a factual
determination which could not, on this record, be resolved by the Court of
Appeals.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated insofar as it
relates to petitioner, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
So ordered.

BLACKMUN, AND STEVENS, J.J., JOINED.

JUSTICE WHITE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
In Pickering v. Board of Education (1968), we stated that a public employee does
not relinquish First Amendment rights to comment on matters of public interest
by virtue of government employment. We also recognized that the State's
interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees "differ
significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech
of the citizenry in general." The problem, we thought, was arriving "at a balance
between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon
matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in
promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its
employees." We return to this problem today and consider whether the First
and Fourteenth Amendments prevent the discharge of a state employee for
circulating a questionnaire concerning internal office affairs.
I
The respondent, Sheila Myers, was employed as an Assistant District Attorney
in New Orleans for five and a half years. She served at the pleasure of petitioner
Harry Connick, the District Attorney for Orleans Parish. During this period
Myers competently performed her responsibilities of trying criminal cases.
In the early part of October 1980, Myers was informed that she would be
transferred to prosecute cases in a different section of the criminal court. Myers
was strongly opposed to the proposed transfer and expressed her view to several
of her supervisors, including Connick. Despite her objections, on October 6
Myers was notified that she was being transferred. Myers again spoke with
Dennis Waldron, one of the First Assistant District Attorneys, expressing her
reluctance to accept the transfer. A number of other office matters were
discussed and Myers later testified that, in response to Waldron's suggestion
that her concerns were not shared by others in the office, she informed him
that she would do some research on the matter.
That night Myers prepared a questionnaire soliciting the views of her fellow staff
members concerning office transfer policy, office morale, the need for a
grievance committee, the level of confidence in supervisors, and whether
employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns. Early the following
morning, Myers typed and copied the questionnaire. She also met with Connick
who urged her to accept the transfer. She said she would "consider" it. Connick
then left the office. Myers then distributed the questionnaire to 15 Assistant
District Attorneys. Shortly after noon, Dennis Waldron learned that Myers was
distributing the survey. He immediately phoned Connick and informed him that
Myers was creating a "mini-insurrection" within the office. Connick returned to
the office and told Myers that she was being terminated because of her refusal

Robson

286

The First Amendment

to accept the transfer. She was also told that her distribution of the
questionnaire was considered an act of insubordination. Connick particularly
objected to the question which inquired whether employees "had confidence in
and would rely on the word" of various superiors in the office, and to a question
concerning pressure to work in political campaigns which he felt would be
damaging if discovered by the press.
Myers filed suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 contending that her employment was
wrongfully terminated because she had exercised her constitutionally protected
right of free speech. The District Court agreed, ordered Myers reinstated, and
awarded backpay, damages, and attorney's fees. The District Court found that
although Connick informed Myers that she was being fired because of her
refusal to accept a transfer, the facts showed that the questionnaire was the
real reason for her termination. The court then proceeded to hold that Myers'
questionnaire involved matters of public concern and that the State had not
"clearly demonstrated" that the survey "substantially interfered" with the
operations of the District Attorney's office.
Connick appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,
which affirmed on the basis of the District Court's opinion. Connick then
sought review in this Court by way of certiorari, which we granted.
II
For at least 15 years, it has been settled that a State cannot condition public
employment on a basis that infringes the employee's constitutionally protected
interest in freedom of expression. Keyishian v. Board of Regents (1967);
Pickering v. Board of Education (1968); Perry v. Sindermann (1972); Branti v.
Finkel (1980). Our task, as we defined it in Pickering, is to seek "a balance
between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon
matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in
promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its
employees." The District Court, and thus the Court of Appeals as well,
misapplied our decision in Pickering and consequently, in our view, erred in
striking the balance for respondent.
*** Pickering, its antecedents, and its progeny lead us to conclude that if Myers'
questionnaire cannot be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter
of public concern, it is unnecessary for us to scrutinize the reasons for her
discharge. When employee expression cannot be fairly considered as relating to
any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community, government
officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices, without intrusive
oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment. Perhaps the
government employer's dismissal of the worker may not be fair, but ordinary
dismissals from government service which violate no fixed tenure or applicable
statute or regulation are not subject to judicial review even if the reasons for the
dismissal are alleged to be mistaken or unreasonable.
*** Whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public concern must
be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as
revealed by the whole record. In this case, with but one exception, the questions
posed by Myers to her co-workers do not fall under the rubric of matters of
"public concern." We view the questions pertaining to the confidence and trust

Robson

287

The First Amendment

that Myers' co-workers possess in various supervisors, the level of office morale,
and the need for a grievance committee as mere extensions of Myers' dispute
over her transfer to another section of the criminal court. Unlike the dissent, we
do not believe these questions are of public import in evaluating the
performance of the District Attorney as an elected official. Myers did not seek to
inform the public that the District Attorney's Office was not discharging its
governmental responsibilities in the investigation and prosecution of criminal
cases. Nor did Myers seek to bring to light actual or potential wrongdoing or
breach of public trust on the part of Connick and others. Indeed, the
questionnaire, if released to the public, would convey no information at all other
than the fact that a single employee is upset with the status quo. While
discipline and morale in the workplace are related to an agency's efficient
performance of its duties, the focus of Myers' questions is not to evaluate the
performance of the office but rather to gather ammunition for another round of
controversy with her superiors. These questions reflect one employee's
dissatisfaction with a transfer and an attempt to turn that displeasure into a
cause celebre.
To presume that all matters which transpire within a government office are of
public concern would mean that virtually every remark — and certainly every
criticism directed at a public official — would plant the seed of a constitutional
case. While as a matter of good judgment, public officials should be receptive to
constructive criticism offered by their employees, the First Amendment does not
require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over
internal office affairs.
One question in Myers' questionnaire, however, does touch upon a matter of
public concern. Question 11 inquires if assistant district attorneys "ever feel
pressured to work in political campaigns on behalf of office supported
candidates." We have recently noted that official pressure upon employees to
work for political candidates not of the worker's own choice constitutes a
coercion of belief in violation of fundamental constitutional rights. Branti v.
Finkel; Elrod v. Burns. In addition, there is a demonstrated interest in this
country that government service should depend upon meritorious performance
rather than political service. CSC v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548 (1973). Given
this history, we believe it apparent that the issue of whether assistant district
attorneys are pressured to work in political campaigns is a matter of interest to
the community upon which it is essential that public employees be able to
speak out freely without fear of retaliatory dismissal.
B
Because one of the questions in Myers' survey touched upon a matter of public
concern and contributed to her discharge, we must determine whether Connick
was justified in discharging Myers. Here the District Court again erred in
imposing an unduly onerous burden on the State to justify Myers' discharge.
The District Court viewed the issue of whether Myers' speech was upon a
matter of "public concern" as a threshold inquiry, after which it became the
government's burden to "clearly demonstrate" that the speech involved
"substantially interfered" with official responsibilities. Yet Pickering
unmistakably states, and respondent agrees, that the State's burden in
justifying a particular discharge varies depending upon the nature of the

Robson

288

The First Amendment

employee's expression. Although such particularized balancing is difficult, the
courts must reach the most appropriate possible balance of the competing
interests.
C
The Pickering balance requires full consideration of the government's interest in
the effective and efficient fulfillment of its responsibilities to the public. ***
We agree with the District Court that there is no demonstration here that the
questionnaire impeded Myers' ability to perform her responsibilities. The
District Court was also correct to recognize that "it is important to the efficient
and successful operation of the District Attorney's office for Assistants to
maintain close working relationships with their superiors." Connick's judgment,
and apparently also that of his first assistant Dennis Waldron, who
characterized Myers' actions as causing a "mini-insurrection," was that Myers'
questionnaire was an act of insubordination which interfered with working
relationships. When close working relationships are essential to fulfilling public
responsibilities, a wide degree of deference to the employer's judgment is
appropriate. Furthermore, we do not see the necessity for an employer to allow
events to unfold to the extent that the disruption of the office and the
destruction of working relationships is manifest before taking action. We
caution that a stronger showing may be necessary if the employee's speech
more substantially involved matters of public concern.
The District Court rejected Connick's position because "[u]nlike a statement of
fact which might be deemed critical of one's superiors, [Myers'] questionnaire
was not a statement of fact but the presentation and solicitation of ideas and
opinions," which are entitled to greater constitutional protection because "
`under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea.'" This
approach, while perhaps relevant in weighing the value of Myers' speech, bears
no logical relationship to the issue of whether the questionnaire undermined
office relationships. Questions, no less than forcefully stated opinions and facts,
carry messages and it requires no unusual insight to conclude that the purpose,
if not the likely result, of the questionnaire is to seek to precipitate a vote of no
confidence in Connick and his supervisors. Thus, Question 10, which asked
whether or not the Assistants had confidence in and relied on the word of five
named supervisors, is a statement that carries the clear potential for
undermining office relations.
Also relevant is the manner, time, and place in which the questionnaire was
distributed. As noted in Givhan: "Private expression . . . may in some situations
bring additional factors to the Pickering calculus. When a government employee
personally confronts his immediate superior, the employing agency's
institutional efficiency may be threatened not only by the content of the
employee's message but also by the manner, time, and place in which it is
delivered." Here the questionnaire was prepared and distributed at the office;
the manner of distribution required not only Myers to leave her work but others
to do the same in order that the questionnaire be completed. Although some
latitude in when official work is performed is to be allowed when professional
employees are involved, and Myers did not violate announced office policy, the

Robson

289

The First Amendment

fact that Myers, unlike Pickering, exercised her rights to speech at the office
supports Connick's fears that the functioning of his office was endangered.
Finally, the context in which the dispute arose is also significant. This is not a
case where an employee, out of purely academic interest, circulated a
questionnaire so as to obtain useful research. Myers acknowledges that it is no
coincidence that the questionnaire followed upon the heels of the transfer
notice. When employee speech concerning office policy arises from an
employment dispute concerning the very application of that policy to the
speaker, additional weight must be given to the supervisor's view that the
employee has threatened the authority of the employer to run the office.
Although we accept the District Court's factual finding that Myers' reluctance to
accede to the transfer order was not a sufficient cause in itself for her dismissal,
and thus does not constitute a sufficient defense under Mt. Healthy, this does
not render irrelevant the fact that the questionnaire emerged after a persistent
dispute between Myers and Connick and his deputies over office transfer policy.
III
Myers' questionnaire touched upon matters of public concern in only a most
limited sense; her survey, in our view, is most accurately characterized as an
employee grievance concerning internal office policy. The limited First
Amendment interest involved here does not require that Connick tolerate action
which he reasonably believed would disrupt the office, undermine his authority,
and destroy close working relationships. Myers' discharge therefore did not
offend the First Amendment. We reiterate, however, the caveat we expressed in
Pickering, "Because of the enormous variety of fact situations in which critical
statements by. . . public employees may be thought by their superiors . . . to
furnish grounds for dismissal, we do not deem it either appropriate or feasible
to attempt to lay down a general standard against which all such statements
may be judged."
Our holding today is grounded in our longstanding recognition that the First
Amendment's primary aim is the full protection of speech upon issues of public
concern, as well as the practical realities involved in the administration of a
government office. Although today the balance is struck for the government,
this is no defeat for the First Amendment. For it would indeed be a Pyrrhic
victory for the great principles of free expression if the Amendment's
safeguarding of a public employee's right, as a citizen, to participate in
discussions concerning public affairs were confused with the attempt to
constitutionalize the employee grievance that we see presented here. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.

JUSTICE BRENNAN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, AND
JUSTICE STEVENS JOIN, DISSENTING.
Sheila Myers was discharged for circulating a questionnaire to her fellow
Assistant District Attorneys seeking information about the effect of petitioner's
personnel policies on employee morale and the overall work performance of the
District Attorney's Office. The Court concludes that her dismissal does not
violate the First Amendment, primarily because the questionnaire addresses
matters that, in the Court's view, are not of public concern. It is hornbook law,
however, that speech about "the manner in which government is operated or
should be operated" is an essential part of the communications necessary for
self-governance the protection of which was a central purpose of the First
Amendment. Because the questionnaire addressed such matters and its
distribution did not adversely affect the operations of the District Attorney's
Office or interfere with Myers' working relationship with her fellow employees, I
dissent.
I
The Court correctly reaffirms the long-established principle that the government
may not constitutionally compel persons to relinquish their First Amendment
rights as a condition of public employment. ***
The Court's decision today is flawed in three respects. First, the Court distorts
the balancing analysis required under Pickering by suggesting that one factor,
Robson

291

The First Amendment

the context in which a statement is made, is to be weighed twice — first in
determining whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public
concern and then in deciding whether the statement adversely affected the
government's interest as an employer. Second, in concluding that the effect of
respondent's personnel policies on employee morale and the work performance
of the District Attorney's Office is not a matter of public concern, the Court
impermissibly narrows the class of subjects on which public employees may
speak out without fear of retaliatory dismissal. Third, the Court misapplies the
Pickering balancing test in holding that Myers could constitutionally be
dismissed for circulating a questionnaire addressed to at least one subject that
was "a matter of interest to the community," in the absence of evidence that her
conduct disrupted the efficient functioning of the District Attorney's Office.
II
*** The standard announced by the Court suggests that the manner and
context in which a statement is made must be weighed on both sides of the
Pickering balance. It is beyond dispute that how and where a public employee
expresses his views are relevant in the second half of the Pickering inquiry —
determining whether the employee's speech adversely affects the government's
interests as an employer. The Court explicitly acknowledged this in Givhan v.
Western Line Consolidated School District (1979) *** But the fact that a public
employee has chosen to express his views in private has nothing whatsoever to
do with the first half of the Pickering calculus — whether those views relate to a
matter of public concern. This conclusion is implicit in Givhan's holding that
the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is not "lost to the
public employee who arranges to communicate privately with his employer
rather than to spread his views before the public."
***Unconstrained discussion concerning the manner in which the government
performs its duties is an essential element of the public discourse necessary to
informed self-government. ***
Applying these principles, I would hold that Myers' questionnaire addressed
matters of public concern because it discussed subjects that could reasonably
be expected to be of interest to persons seeking to develop informed opinions
about the manner in which the Orleans Parish District Attorney, an elected
official charged with managing a vital governmental agency, discharges his
responsibilities. The questionnaire sought primarily to obtain information about
the impact of the recent transfers on morale in the District Attorney's Office. It
is beyond doubt that personnel decisions that adversely affect discipline and
morale may ultimately impair an agency's efficient performance of its duties.
Because I believe the First Amendment protects the right of public employees to
discuss such matters so that the public may be better informed about how their
elected officials fulfill their responsibilities, I would affirm the District Court's
conclusion that the questionnaire related to matters of public importance and
concern.
The Court's adoption of a far narrower conception of what subjects are of public
concern seems prompted by its fears that a broader view "would mean that
virtually every remark — and certainly every criticism directed at a public
official — would plant the seed of a constitutional case." Obviously, not every

Robson

292

The First Amendment

remark directed at a public official by a public employee is protected by the
First Amendment. But deciding whether a particular matter is of public concern
is an inquiry that, by its very nature, is a sensitive one for judges charged with
interpreting a constitutional provision intended to put "the decision as to what
views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us . . . ." Cohen v.
California, (1971). *** In making such a delicate inquiry, we must bear in mind
that "the citizenry is the final judge of the proper conduct of public business."
The Court's decision ignores these precepts. Based on its own narrow
conception of which matters are of public concern, the Court implicitly
determines that information concerning employee morale at an important
government office will not inform public debate. To the contrary, the First
Amendment protects the dissemination of such information so that the people,
not the courts, may evaluate its usefulness. The proper means to ensure that
the courts are not swamped with routine employee grievances mischaracterized
as First Amendment cases is not to restrict artificially the concept of "public
concern," but to require that adequate weight be given to the public's important
interests in the efficient performance of governmental functions and in
preserving employee discipline and harmony sufficient to achieve that end.
III
Although the Court finds most of Myers' questionnaire unrelated to matters of
public interest, it does hold that one question — asking whether Assistants felt
pressured to work in political campaigns on behalf of office-supported
candidates — addressed a matter of public importance and concern. The Court
also recognizes that this determination of public interest must weigh heavily in
the balancing of competing interests required by Pickering. Having gone that far,
however, the Court misapplies the Pickering test and holds — against our
previous authorities — that a public employer's mere apprehension that speech
will be disruptive justifies suppression of that speech when all the objective
evidence suggests that those fears are essentially unfounded. ***
The District Court weighed all of the relevant factors identified by our cases. It
found that petitioner failed to establish that Myers violated either a duty of
confidentiality or an office policy. Noting that most of the copies of the
questionnaire were distributed during lunch, it rejected the contention that the
distribution of the questionnaire impeded Myers' performance of her duties, and
it concluded that "Connick has not shown any evidence to indicate that the
plaintiff's work performance was adversely affected by her expression."
The Court accepts all of these findings. It concludes, however, that the District
Court failed to give adequate weight to the context in which the questionnaire
was distributed and to the need to maintain close working relationships in the
District Attorney's Office. In particular, the Court suggests the District Court
failed to give sufficient weight to the disruptive potential of Question 10, which
asked whether the Assistants had confidence in the word of five named
supervisors. The District Court, however, explicitly recognized that this was
petitioner's "most forceful argument"; but after hearing the testimony of four of
the five supervisors named in the question, it found that the question had no
adverse effect on Myers' relationship with her superiors. To this the Court
responds that an employer need not wait until the destruction of working

Robson

293

The First Amendment

relationships is manifest before taking action. In the face of the District Court's
finding that the circulation of the questionnaire had no disruptive effect, the
Court holds that respondent may be dismissed because petitioner "reasonably
believed [the action] would disrupt the office, undermine his authority, and
destroy close working relationships." Even though the District Court found that
the distribution of the questionnaire did not impair Myers' working relationship
with her supervisors, the Court bows to petitioner's judgment because "[w]hen
close working relationships are essential to fulfilling public responsibilities, a
wide degree of deference to the employer's judgment is appropriate."
Such extreme deference to the employer's judgment is not appropriate when
public employees voice critical views concerning the operations of the agency for
which they work. *** If the employer's judgment is to be controlling, public
employees will not speak out when what they have to say is critical of their
supervisors. In order to protect public employees' First Amendment right to
voice critical views on issues of public importance, the courts must make their
own appraisal of the effects of the speech in question.
*** After reviewing the evidence, the District Court found that "it cannot be said
that the defendant's interest in promoting the efficiency of the public services
performed through his employees was either adversely affected or substantially
impeded by plaintiff's distribution of the questionnaire." 507 F. Supp., at 759.
Based on these findings the District Court concluded that the circulation of the
questionnaire was protected by the First Amendment. The District Court
applied the proper legal standard and reached an acceptable accommodation
between the competing interests. I would affirm its decision and the judgment
of the Court of Appeals.
IV
The Court's decision today inevitably will deter public employees from making
critical statements about the manner in which government agencies are
operated for fear that doing so will provoke their dismissal. As a result, the
public will be deprived of valuable information with which to evaluate the
performance of elected officials. Because protecting the dissemination of such
information is an essential function of the First Amendment, I dissent.

The issue in this case is whether a clerical employee in a county Constable's
office was properly discharged for remarking, after hearing of an attempt on the
life of the President, "If they go for him again, I hope they get him."
I

Robson

294

The First Amendment

On January 12, 1981, respondent Ardith McPherson was appointed a deputy in
the office of the Constable of Harris County, Texas. The Constable is an elected
official who functions as a law enforcement officer. At the time of her
appointment, McPherson, a black woman, was 19 years old and had attended
college for a year, studying secretarial science. Her appointment was
conditional for a 90-day probationary period.
Although McPherson's title was "deputy constable," this was the case only
because all employees of the Constable's office, regardless of job function, were
deputy constables. She was not a commissioned peace officer, did not wear a
uniform, and was not authorized to make arrests or permitted to carry a gun.
McPherson's duties were purely clerical. Her work station was a desk at which
there was no telephone, in a room to which the public did not have ready
access. Her job was to type data from court papers into a computer that
maintained an automated record of the status of civil process in the county. Her
training consisted of two days of instruction in the operation of her computer
terminal.
On March 30, 1981, McPherson and some fellow employees heard on an office
radio that there had been an attempt to assassinate the President of the United
States. Upon hearing that report, McPherson engaged a co-worker, Lawrence
Jackson, who was apparently her boyfriend, in a brief conversation, which
according to McPherson's uncontroverted testimony went as follows:
"Q: What did you say?
"A: I said I felt that that would happen sooner or later.
"Q: Okay. And what did Lawrence say?
"A: Lawrence said, yeah, agreeing with me.
"Q: Okay. Now, when you - after Lawrence spoke, then what was your next
comment?
"A: Well, we were talking - it's a wonder why they did that. I felt like it would be
a black person that did that, because I feel like most of my kind is on welfare
and CETA, and they use medicaid, and at the time, I was thinking that's what it
was.
". . . But then after I said that, and then Lawrence said, yeah, he's cutting back
medicaid and food stamps. And I said, yeah, welfare and CETA. I said, shoot, if
they go for him again, I hope they get him."

McPherson's last remark was overheard by another Deputy Constable, who,
unbeknownst to McPherson, was in the room at the time. The remark was
reported to Constable Rankin, who summoned McPherson. McPherson readily
admitted that she had made the statement, but testified that she told Rankin,
upon being asked if she made the statement, "Yes, but I didn't mean anything
by it." After their discussion, Rankin fired McPherson.
McPherson brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Texas under 42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging that petitioner Rankin, in
discharging her, had violated her constitutional rights under color of state law.
She sought reinstatement, backpay, costs and fees, and other equitable relief.
The District Court held a hearing, and then granted summary judgment to
Constable Rankin, holding that McPherson's speech had been unprotected and
that her discharge had therefore been proper. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit vacated and remanded for trial on the ground that substantial issues of

Robson

295

The First Amendment

material fact regarding the context in which the statement had been made
precluded the entry of summary judgment.
On remand, the District Court held another hearing and ruled once again, this
time from the bench, that the statements were not protected speech. Again, the
Court of Appeals reversed. It held that McPherson's remark had addressed a
matter of public concern, requiring that society's interest in McPherson's
freedom of speech be weighed against her employer's interest in maintaining
efficiency and discipline in the workplace. Performing that balancing, the Court
of Appeals concluded that the Government's interest did not outweigh the First
Amendment interest in protecting McPherson's speech. Given the nature of
McPherson's job and the fact that she was not a law enforcement officer, was
not brought by virtue of her job into contact with the public, and did not have
access to sensitive information, the Court of Appeals deemed her "duties . . . so
utterly ministerial and her potential for undermining the office's mission so
trivial" as to forbid her dismissal for expression of her political opinions.
"However ill-considered Ardith McPherson's opinion was," the Court of Appeals
concluded, "it did not make her unfit" for the job she held in Constable
Rankin's office. The Court of Appeals remanded the case for determination of an
appropriate remedy.
We granted certiorari and now affirm.
II
It is clearly established that a State may not discharge an employee on a basis
that infringes that employee's constitutionally protected interest in freedom of
speech. Perry v. Sindermann (1972). Even though McPherson was merely a
probationary employee, and even if she could have been discharged for any
reason or for no reason at all, she may nonetheless be entitled to reinstatement
if she was discharged for exercising her constitutional right to freedom of
expression.
The determination whether a public employer has properly discharged an
employee for engaging in speech requires "a balance between the interests of
the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and
the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the
public services it performs through its employees." Pickering v. Board of
Education (1968); Connick v. Myers (1983). This balancing is necessary in order
to accommodate the dual role of the public employer as a provider of public
services and as a government entity operating under the constraints of the First
Amendment. On the one hand, public employers are employers, concerned with
the efficient function of their operations; review of every personnel decision
made by a public employer could, in the long run, hamper the performance of
public functions. On the other hand, "the threat of dismissal from public
employment is . . . a potent means of inhibiting speech." Pickering. Vigilance is
necessary to ensure that public employers do not use authority over employees
to silence discourse, not because it hampers public functions but simply
because superiors disagree with the content of employees' speech.
A

The First Amendment

The threshold question in applying this balancing test is whether McPherson's
speech may be "fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public
concern." Connick. "Whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public
concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given
statement, as revealed by the whole record." The District Court apparently
found that McPherson's speech did not address a matter of public concern. The
Court of Appeals rejected this conclusion, finding that "the life and death of the
President are obviously matters of public concern." ***
Considering the statement in context, as Connick requires, discloses that it
plainly dealt with a matter of public concern. The statement was made in the
course of a conversation addressing the policies of the President's
administration. It came on the heels of a news bulletin regarding what is
certainly a matter of heightened public attention: an attempt on the life of the
President. While a statement that amounted to a threat to kill the President
would not be protected by the First Amendment, the District Court concluded,
and we agree, that McPherson's statement did not amount to a threat
punishable under 18 U.S.C. 871(a) or 18 U.S.C. 2385, or, indeed, that could
properly be criminalized at all. The inappropriate or controversial character of a
statement is irrelevant to the question whether it deals with a matter of public
concern. "[D]ebate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and
wideopen, and . . . may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes
unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials." New York
Times Co. v. Sullivan.
B
Because McPherson's statement addressed a matter of public concern,
Pickering next requires that we balance McPherson's interest in making her
statement against "the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the
efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees." The State
bears a burden of justifying the discharge on legitimate grounds. Connick.
In performing the balancing, the statement will not be considered in a vacuum;
the manner, time, and place of the employee's expression are relevant, as is the
context in which the dispute arose. We have previously recognized as pertinent
considerations whether the statement impairs discipline by superiors or
harmony among co-workers, has a detrimental impact on close working
relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary, or
impedes the performance of the speaker's duties or interferes with the regular
operation of the enterprise.
These considerations, and indeed the very nature of the balancing test, make
apparent that the state interest element of the test focuses on the effective
functioning of the public employer's enterprise. Interference with work,
personnel relationships, or the speaker's job performance can detract from the
public employer's function; avoiding such interference can be a strong state
interest. From this perspective, however, petitioners fail to demonstrate a state
interest that outweighs McPherson's First Amendment rights. While
McPherson's statement was made at the workplace, there is no evidence that it
interfered with the efficient functioning of the office. The Constable was
evidently not afraid that McPherson had disturbed or interrupted other

Robson

297

The First Amendment

employees - he did not inquire to whom respondent had made the remark and
testified that he "was not concerned who she had made it to," Tr. 42. In fact,
Constable Rankin testified that the possibility of interference with the functions
of the Constable's office had not been a consideration in his discharge of
respondent and that he did not even inquire whether the remark had disrupted
the work of the office.
Nor was there any danger that McPherson had discredited the office by making
her statement in public. McPherson's speech took place in an area to which
there was ordinarily no public access; her remark was evidently made in a
private conversation with another employee. There is no suggestion that any
member of the general public was present or heard McPherson's statement. Nor
is there any evidence that employees other than Jackson who worked in the
room even heard the remark. Not only was McPherson's discharge unrelated to
the functioning of the office, it was not based on any assessment by the
Constable that the remark demonstrated a character trait that made
respondent unfit to perform her work.
While the facts underlying Rankin's discharge of McPherson are, despite
extensive proceedings in the District Court, still somewhat unclear, it is
undisputed that he fired McPherson based on the content of her speech.
Evidently because McPherson had made the statement, and because the
Constable believed that she "meant it," he decided that she was not a suitable
employee to have in a law enforcement agency. But in weighing the State's
interest in discharging an employee based on any claim that the content of a
statement made by the employee somehow undermines the mission of the
public employer, some attention must be paid to the responsibilities of the
employee within the agency. The burden of caution employees bear with respect
to the words they speak will vary with the extent of authority and public
accountability the employee's role entails. Where, as here, an employee serves
no confidential, policymaking, or public contact role, the danger to the agency's
successful functioning from that employee's private speech is minimal. We
cannot believe that every employee in Constable Rankin's office, whether
computer operator, electrician, or file clerk, is equally required, on pain of
discharge, to avoid any statement susceptible of being interpreted by the
Constable as an indication that the employee may be unworthy of employment
in his law enforcement agency. At some point, such concerns are so removed
from the effective functioning of the public employer that they cannot prevail
over the free speech rights of the public employee.
This is such a case. McPherson's employment-related interaction with the
Constable was apparently negligible. Her duties were purely clerical and were
limited solely to the civil process function of the Constable's office. There is no
indication that she would ever be in a position to further - or indeed to have any
involvement with - the minimal law enforcement activity engaged in by the
Constable's office. Given the function of the agency, McPherson's position in the
office, and the nature of her statement, we are not persuaded that Rankin's
interest in discharging her outweighed her rights under the First Amendment.

The First Amendment

Because we agree with the Court of Appeals that McPherson's discharge was
improper, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
JUSTICE POWELL, CONCURRING [OMITTED]
JUSTICE SCALIA, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, AND JUSTICE
O'CONNOR JOIN, DISSENTING.
I agree with the proposition, felicitously put by Constable Rankin's counsel,
that no law enforcement agency is required by the First Amendment to permit
one of its employees to "ride with the cops and cheer for the robbers." The issue
in this case is whether Constable Rankin, a law enforcement official, is
prohibited by the First Amendment from preventing his employees from saying
of the attempted assassination of President Reagan - on the job and within
hearing of other employees - "If they go for him again, I hope they get him." The
Court, applying the two-prong analysis of Connick v. Myers (1983), holds that
McPherson's statement was protected by the First Amendment because (1) it
"addressed a matter of public concern," and (2) McPherson's interest in making
the statement outweighs Rankin's interest in suppressing it. In so doing, the
Court significantly and irrationally expands the definition of "public concern"; it
also carves out a new and very large class of employees - i. e., those in
"nonpolicymaking" positions - who, if today's decision is to be believed, can
never be disciplined for statements that fall within the Court's expanded
definition. Because I believe the Court's conclusions rest upon a distortion of
both the record and the Court's prior decisions, I dissent.
I
*** McPherson's statement is indeed so different from those that [we have held
protected] it is only one step removed from statements that we have previously
held entitled to no First Amendment protection even in the nonemployment
context - including assassination threats against the President (which are illegal
under 18 U.S.C. 871), “fighting words,” epithets or personal abuse; and
advocacy of force or violence. A statement lying so near the category of
completely unprotected speech cannot fairly be viewed as lying within the
"heart" of the First Amendment's protection; it lies within that category of
speech that can neither be characterized as speech on matters of public
concern nor properly subject to criminal penalties. Once McPherson stopped
explicitly criticizing the President's policies and expressed a desire that he be
assassinated, she crossed the line.
The Court reaches the opposite conclusion only by distorting the concept of
"public concern." It does not explain how a statement expressing approval of a
serious and violent crime - assassination of the President - can possibly fall
within that category. It simply rehearses the "context" of McPherson's statement,
which as we have already seen is irrelevant here, and then concludes that
because of that context, and because the statement "came on the heels of a
news bulletin regarding what is certainly a matter of heightened public
attention: an attempt on the life of the President," the statement "plainly dealt
Robson

299

The First Amendment

with a matter of public concern." I cannot respond to this progression of
reasoning except to say I do not understand it. Surely the Court does not mean
to adopt the reasoning of the court below, which was that McPherson's
statement was "addressed to a matter of public concern" within the meaning of
Connick because the public would obviously be "concerned" about the
assassination of the President. That is obviously untenable: The public would
be "concerned" about a statement threatening to blow up the local federal
building or demanding a $1 million extortion payment, yet that kind of "public
concern" does not entitle such a statement to any First Amendment protection
at all.
II
Even if I agreed that McPherson's statement was speech on a matter of "public
concern," I would still find it unprotected. It is important to be clear on what
the issue is in this part of the case. It is not, as the Court suggests, whether
"Rankin's interest in discharging [McPherson] outweighed her rights under the
First Amendment." Rather, it is whether his interest in preventing the
expression of such statements in his agency outweighed her First Amendment
interest in making the statement. We are not deliberating, in other words, (or at
least should not be) about whether the sanction of dismissal was, as the
concurrence puts it, "an . . . intemperat[e] employment decision." It may well
have been - and personally I think it was. But we are not sitting as a panel to
develop sound principles of proportionality for adverse actions in the state civil
service. We are asked to determine whether, given the interests of this law
enforcement office, McPherson had a right to say what she did - so that she
could not only not be fired for it, but could not be formally reprimanded for it,
or even prevented from repeating it endlessly into the future. It boggles the
mind to think that she has such a right.
The Constable testified that he "was very concerned that this remark was
made." Rightly so. As a law enforcement officer, the Constable obviously has a
strong interest in preventing statements by any of his employees approving, or
expressing a desire for, serious, violent crimes - regardless of whether the
statements actually interfere with office operations at the time they are made or
demonstrate character traits that make the speaker unsuitable for law
enforcement work. ***
Statements by the Constable's employees to the effect that "if they go for the
President again, I hope they get him" might also, to put it mildly, undermine
public confidence in the Constable's office. ***
In sum, since Constable Rankin's interest in maintaining both an esprit de
corps and a public image consistent with his office's law enforcement duties
outweighs any interest his employees may have in expressing on the job a
desire that the President be killed, even assuming that such an expression
addresses a matter of public concern it is not protected by the First Amendment
from suppression. I emphasize once again that that is the issue here - and not,
as both the Court's opinion and especially the concurrence seem to assume,
whether the means used to effect suppression (viz., firing) were excessive. The
First Amendment contains no "narrow tailoring" requirement that speech the
government is entitled to suppress must be suppressed by the mildest means

Robson

300

The First Amendment

possible. If Constable Rankin was entitled (as I think any reasonable person
would say he was) to admonish McPherson for saying what she did on the job,
within hearing of her co-workers, and to warn her that if she did it again a
formal censure would be placed in her personnel file, then it follows that he is
entitled to rule that particular speech out of bounds in that particular work
environment - and that is the end of the First Amendment analysis. The
"intemperate" manner of the permissible suppression is an issue for another
forum, or at least for a more plausibly relevant provision of the Constitution.
Because the statement at issue here did not address a matter of public concern,
and because, even if it did, a law enforcement agency has adequate reason not
to permit such expression, I would reverse the judgment of the court below.

San	  Diego	  v.	  Roe	  
543 U.S. 77 (2004)

PER CURIAM.
The city of San Diego (City), a petitioner here, terminated a police officer,
respondent, for selling videotapes he made and for related activity. The tapes
showed the respondent engaging in sexually explicit acts. Respondent brought
suit alleging, among other things, that the termination violated his First and
Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech. The United States District
Court for the Southern District of California granted the City's motion to
dismiss. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.
The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is reversed.
I
Respondent John Roe, a San Diego police officer, made a video showing himself
stripping off a police uniform and masturbating. He sold the video on the
adults-only section of eBay, the popular online auction site. His user name was
"Code3stud@aol.com," a word play on a high priority police radio call. The
uniform apparently was not the specific uniform worn by the San Diego police,
but it was clearly identifiable as a police uniform. Roe also sold custom videos,
as well as police equipment, including official uniforms of the San Diego Police
Department (SDPD), and various other items such as men's underwear. Roe's
eBay user profile identified him as employed in the field of law enforcement.
Roe's supervisor, a police sergeant, discovered Roe's activities when, while on
eBay, he came across an official SDPD police uniform for sale offered by an
individual with the user-name "Code3stud@aol.com." He searched for other
items Code3stud offered and discovered listings for Roe's videos depicting the
objectionable material. Recognizing Roe's picture, the sergeant printed images
of certain of Roe's offerings and shared them with others in Roe's chain of
command, including a police captain. The captain notified the SDPD's internal
affairs department, which began an investigation. In response to a request by
an undercover officer, Roe produced a custom video. It showed Roe, again in
police uniform, issuing a traffic citation but revoking it after undoing the
uniform and masturbating.

Robson

301

The First Amendment

The investigation revealed that Roe's conduct violated specific SDPD policies,
including conduct unbecoming of an officer, outside employment, and immoral
conduct. When confronted, Roe admitted to selling the videos and police
paraphernalia. The SDPD ordered Roe to "cease displaying, manufacturing,
distributing or selling any sexually explicit materials or engaging in any similar
behaviors, via the internet, U. S. Mail, commercial vendors or distributors, or
any other medium available to the public." Although Roe removed some of the
items he had offered for sale, he did not change his seller's profile, which
described the first two videos he had produced and listed their prices as well as
the prices for custom videos. After discovering Roe's failure to follow its orders,
the SDPD—citing Roe for the added violation of disobedience of lawful orders—
began termination proceedings. The proceedings resulted in Roe's dismissal
from the police force.
Roe brought suit in the District Court *** alleging that the employment
termination violated his First Amendment right to free speech. In granting the
City's motion to dismiss, the District Court decided that Roe had not
demonstrated that selling official police uniforms and producing, marketing,
and selling sexually explicit videos for profit qualified as expression relating to a
matter of "public concern" under this Court's decision in Connick v.Myers.
In reversing, the Court of Appeals held Roe's conduct fell within the protected
category of citizen commentary on matters of public concern. Central to the
Court of Appeals' conclusion was that Roe's expression was not an internal
workplace grievance, took place while he was off duty and away from his
employer's premises, and was unrelated to his employment.
II
A government employee does not relinquish all First Amendment rights
otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of his or her employment. On the
other hand, a governmental employer may impose certain restraints on the
speech of its employees, restraints that would be unconstitutional if applied to
the general public. The Court has recognized the right of employees to speak on
matters of public concern, typically matters concerning government policies
that are of interest to the public at large, a subject on which public employees
are uniquely qualified to comment. Outside of this category, the Court has held
that when government employees speak or write on their own time on topics
unrelated to their employment, the speech can have First Amendment
protection, absent some governmental justification "far stronger than mere
speculation" in regulating it. We have little difficulty in concluding that the City
was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases.
A
In concluding that Roe's activities qualified as a matter of public concern, the
Court of Appeals relied heavily on the Court's decision in NTEU. [ United States
v. National Treasury Employees Union (1995)]. In NTEU it was established that
the speech was unrelated to the employment and had no effect on the mission
and purpose of the employer. The question was whether the Federal
Government could impose certain monetary limitations on outside earnings
from speaking or writing on a class of federal employees. The Court held that,
within the particular classification of employment, the Government had shown

Robson

302

The First Amendment

no justification for the outside salary limitations. The First Amendment right of
the employees sufficed to invalidate the restrictions on the outside earnings for
such activities. The Court noted that throughout history public employees who
undertook to write or to speak in their spare time had made substantial
contributions to literature and art, and observed that none of the speech at
issue "even arguably [had] any adverse impact" on the employer.
The Court of Appeals' reliance on NTEU was seriously misplaced. Although
Roe's activities took place outside the workplace and purported to be about
subjects not related to his employment, the SDPD demonstrated legitimate and
substantial interests of its own that were compromised by his speech. Far from
confining his activities to speech unrelated to his employment, Roe took
deliberate steps to link his videos and other wares to his police work, all in a
way injurious to his employer. The use of the uniform, the law enforcement
reference in the Web site, the listing of the speaker as "in the field of law
enforcement," and the debased parody of an officer performing indecent acts
while in the course of official duties brought the mission of the employer and
the professionalism of its officers into serious disrepute.
The Court of Appeals noted the City conceded Roe's activities were "unrelated"
to his employment. In the context of the pleadings and arguments, the proper
interpretation of the City's statement is simply to underscore the obvious
proposition that Roe's speech was not a comment on the workings or
functioning of the SDPD. It is quite a different question whether the speech was
detrimental to the SDPD. On that score the City's consistent position has been
that the speech is contrary to its regulations and harmful to the proper
functioning of the police force. The present case falls outside the protection
afforded in NTEU. The authorities that instead control, and which are
considered below, are this Court's decisions in Pickering, Connick, and the
decisions which follow them.
B
To reconcile the employee's right to engage in speech and the government
employer's right to protect its own legitimate interests in performing its mission,
the Pickering Court adopted a balancing test. It requires a court evaluating
restraints on a public employee's speech to balance "the interests of the
[employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the
interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public
services it performs through its employees."
Underlying the decision in Pickering is the recognition that public employees are
often the members of the community who are likely to have informed opinions
as to the operations of their public employers, operations which are of
substantial concern to the public. Were they not able to speak on these matters,
the community would be deprived of informed opinions on important public
issues. The interest at stake is as much the public's interest in receiving
informed opinion as it is the employee's own right to disseminate it.
Pickering did not hold that any and all statements by a public employee are
entitled to balancing. To require Pickering balancing in every case where speech
by a public employee is at issue, no matter the content of the speech, could
compromise the proper functioning of government offices. This concern

Robson

303

The First Amendment

prompted the Court in Connick to explain a threshold inquiry (implicit in
Pickering itself) that in order to merit Pickering balancing, a public employee's
speech must touch on a matter of "public concern." ***
Although the boundaries of the public concern test are not well defined,
Connick provides some guidance. It directs courts to examine the "content, form,
and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record" in assessing
whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public concern. In
addition, it notes that the standard for determining whether expression is of
public concern is the same standard used to determine whether a common-law
action for invasion of privacy is present. *** These cases make clear that public
concern is something that is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a
subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public at the time of
publication. The Court has also recognized that certain private remarks, such
as negative comments about the President of the United States, touch on
matters of public concern and should thus be subject to Pickering balancing.
Applying these principles to the instant case, there is no difficulty in concluding
that Roe's expression does not qualify as a matter of public concern under any
view of the public concern test. He fails the threshold test and Pickering
balancing does not come into play.
Connick is controlling precedent, but to show why this is not a close case it is
instructive to note that even under the view expressed by the dissent in Connick
from four Members of the Court, the speech here would not come within the
definition of a matter of public concern. The dissent in Connick would have held
that the entirety of the questionnaire circulated by the employee "discussed
subjects that could reasonably be expected to be of interest to persons seeking
to develop informed opinions about the manner in which . . . an elected official
charged with managing a vital governmental agency, discharges his
responsibilities." No similar purpose could be attributed to the employee's
speech in the present case. Roe's activities did nothing to inform the public
about any aspect of the SDPD's functioning or operation. Nor were Roe's
activities anything like the private remarks at issue in Rankin, where one coworker commented to another co-worker on an item of political news. Roe's
expression was widely broadcast, linked to his official status as a police officer,
and designed to exploit his employer's image.
The speech in question was detrimental to the mission and functions of the
employer. There is no basis for finding that it was of concern to the community
as the Court's cases have understood that term in the context of restrictions by
governmental entities on the speech of their employees.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.

the Court between 1979 and 2004 is Connick v. Myers, a 5-4 decision in

more persuasive? Is the case merely an application of Pickering or does it

A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH STEVENS AND GINSBURG, JJ., JOINED. BREYER, J., FILED A
DISSENTING OPINION.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
It is well settled that "a State cannot condition public employment on a basis
that infringes the employee's constitutionally protected interest in freedom of
expression." The question presented by the instant case is whether the First
Amendment protects a government employee from discipline based on speech
made pursuant to the employee's official duties.
I
Respondent Richard Ceballos has been employed since 1989 as a deputy
district attorney for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. During
the period relevant to this case, Ceballos was a calendar deputy in the office's
Pomona branch, and in this capacity he exercised certain supervisory
responsibilities over other lawyers. In February 2000, a defense attorney
contacted Ceballos about a pending criminal case. The defense attorney said
there were inaccuracies in an affidavit used to obtain a critical search warrant.
The attorney informed Ceballos that he had filed a motion to traverse, or
challenge, the warrant, but he also wanted Ceballos to review the case.
According to Ceballos, it was not unusual for defense attorneys to ask calendar
deputies to investigate aspects of pending cases.
After examining the affidavit and visiting the location it described, Ceballos
determined the affidavit contained serious misrepresentations. The affidavit
called a long driveway what Ceballos thought should have been referred to as a
separate roadway. Ceballos also questioned the affidavit's statement that tire
tracks led from a stripped-down truck to the premises covered by the warrant.

Robson

305

The First Amendment

His doubts arose from his conclusion that the roadway's composition in some
places made it difficult or impossible to leave visible tire tracks.
Ceballos spoke on the telephone to the warrant affiant, a deputy sheriff from
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, but he did not receive a
satisfactory explanation for the perceived inaccuracies. He relayed his findings
to his supervisors, petitioners Carol Najera and Frank Sundstedt, and followed
up by preparing a disposition memorandum. The memo explained Ceballos'
concerns and recommended dismissal of the case. On March 2, 2000, Ceballos
submitted the memo to Sundstedt for his review. A few days later, Ceballos
presented Sundstedt with another memo, this one describing a second
telephone conversation between Ceballos and the warrant affiant.
Based on Ceballos' statements, a meeting was held to discuss the affidavit.
Attendees included Ceballos, Sundstedt, and Najera, as well as the warrant
affiant and other employees from the sheriff's department. The meeting
allegedly became heated, with one lieutenant sharply criticizing Ceballos for his
handling of the case.
Despite Ceballos' concerns, Sundstedt decided to proceed with the prosecution,
pending disposition of the defense motion to traverse. The trial court held a
hearing on the motion. Ceballos was called by the defense and recounted his
observations about the affidavit, but the trial court rejected the challenge to the
warrant.
Ceballos claims that in the aftermath of these events he was subjected to a
series of retaliatory employment actions. The actions included reassignment
from his calendar deputy position to a trial deputy position, transfer to another
courthouse, and denial of a promotion. Ceballos initiated an employment
grievance, but the grievance was denied based on a finding that he had not
suffered any retaliation. Unsatisfied, Ceballos sued *** [and] alleged petitioners
violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments by retaliating against him based
on his memo of March 2.
Petitioners responded that no retaliatory actions were taken against Ceballos
and that all the actions of which he complained were explained by legitimate
reasons such as staffing needs. They further contended that, in any event,
Ceballos' memo was not protected speech under the First Amendment.
Petitioners moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted their
motion. Noting that Ceballos wrote his memo pursuant to his employment
duties, the court concluded he was not entitled to First Amendment protection
for the memo's contents. It held in the alternative that even if Ceballos' speech
was constitutionally protected, petitioners had qualified immunity because the
rights Ceballos asserted were not clearly established.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that "Ceballos's
allegations of wrongdoing in the memorandum constitute protected speech
under the First Amendment." *** Having concluded that Ceballos' memo
satisfied the public-concern requirement, the Court of Appeals proceeded to
balance Ceballos' interest in his speech against his supervisors' interest in
responding to it. The court struck the balance in Ceballos' favor, noting that
petitioners "failed even to suggest disruption or inefficiency in the workings of
the District Attorney's Office" as a result of the memo. The court further

Robson

306

The First Amendment

concluded that Ceballos' First Amendment rights were clearly established and
that petitioners' actions were not objectively reasonable.
Judge O'Scannlain specially concurred. Agreeing that the panel's decision was
compelled by Circuit precedent, he nevertheless concluded Circuit law should
be revisited and overruled. Judge O'Scannlain emphasized the distinction
"between speech offered by a public employee acting as an employee carrying
out his or her ordinary job duties and that spoken by an employee acting as a
citizen expressing his or her personal views on disputed matters of public
import." In his view, "when public employees speak in the course of carrying out
their routine, required employment obligations, they have no personal interest
in the content of that speech that gives rise to a First Amendment right."
We granted certiorari and we now reverse.
II
As the Court's decisions have noted, for many years "the unchallenged dogma
was that a public employee had no right to object to conditions placed upon the
terms of employment—including those which restricted the exercise of
constitutional rights." That dogma has been qualified in important respects. The
Court has made clear that public employees do not surrender all their First
Amendment rights by reason of their employment. Rather, the First Amendment
protects a public employee's right, in certain circumstances, to speak as a
citizen addressing matters of public concern.
*** Pickering and the cases decided in its wake identify two inquiries to guide
interpretation of the constitutional protections accorded to public employee
speech. The first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen
on a matter of public concern. If the answer is no, the employee has no First
Amendment cause of action based on his or her employer's reaction to the
speech. If the answer is yes, then the possibility of a First Amendment claim
arises. The question becomes whether the relevant government entity had an
adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other
member of the general public. This consideration reflects the importance of the
relationship between the speaker's expressions and employment. A government
entity has broader discretion to restrict speech when it acts in its role as
employer, but the restrictions it imposes must be directed at speech that has
some potential to affect the entity's operations.
To be sure, conducting these inquiries sometimes has proved difficult. This is
the necessary product of "the enormous variety of fact situations in which
critical statements by teachers and other public employees may be thought by
their superiors . . . to furnish grounds for dismissal." The Court's overarching
objectives, though, are evident.
***
III
With these principles in mind we turn to the instant case. Respondent Ceballos
believed the affidavit used to obtain a search warrant contained serious
misrepresentations. He conveyed his opinion and recommendation in a memo
to his supervisor. That Ceballos expressed his views inside his office, rather
than publicly, is not dispositive. Employees in some cases may receive First
Robson

307

The First Amendment

Amendment protection for expressions made at work. Many citizens do much of
their talking inside their respective workplaces, and it would not serve the goal
of treating public employees like "any member of the general public," to hold
that all speech within the office is automatically exposed to restriction.
The memo concerned the subject matter of Ceballos' employment, but this, too,
is nondispositive. The First Amendment protects some expressions related to
the speaker's job. As the Court noted in Pickering: "Teachers are, as a class, the
members of a community most likely to have informed and definite opinions as
to how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should be spent.
Accordingly, it is essential that they be able to speak out freely on such
questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal." The same is true of many other
categories of public employees.
The controlling factor in Ceballos' case is that his expressions were made
pursuant to his duties as a calendar deputy. That consideration—the fact that
Ceballos spoke as a prosecutor fulfilling a responsibility to advise his supervisor
about how best to proceed with a pending case— distinguishes Ceballos' case
from those in which the First Amendment provides protection against discipline.
We hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official
duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment
purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from
employer discipline.
Ceballos wrote his disposition memo because that is part of what he, as a
calendar deputy, was employed to do. It is immaterial whether he experienced
some personal gratification from writing the memo; his First Amendment rights
do not depend on his job satisfaction. The significant point is that the memo
was written pursuant to Ceballos' official duties. Restricting speech that owes
its existence to a public employee's professional responsibilities does not
infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen. It
simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself
has commissioned or created. Contrast, for example, the expressions made by
the speaker in Pickering, whose letter to the newspaper had no official
significance and bore similarities to letters submitted by numerous citizens
every day.
Ceballos did not act as a citizen when he went about conducting his daily
professional activities, such as supervising attorneys, investigating charges, and
preparing filings. In the same way he did not speak as a citizen by writing a
memo that addressed the proper disposition of a pending criminal case. When
he went to work and performed the tasks he was paid to perform, Ceballos
acted as a government employee. The fact that his duties sometimes required
him to speak or write does not mean his supervisors were prohibited from
evaluating his performance.
This result is consistent with our precedents' attention to the potential societal
value of employee speech. Refusing to recognize First Amendment claims based
on government employees' work product does not prevent them from
participating in public debate. The employees retain the prospect of
constitutional protection for their contributions to the civic discourse. This

Robson

308

The First Amendment

prospect of protection, however, does not invest them with a right to perform
their jobs however they see fit.
Our holding likewise is supported by the emphasis of our precedents on
affording government employers sufficient discretion to manage their operations.
Employers have heightened interests in controlling speech made by an
employee in his or her professional capacity. Official communications have
official consequences, creating a need for substantive consistency and clarity.
Supervisors must ensure that their employees' official communications are
accurate, demonstrate sound judgment, and promote the employer's mission.
Ceballos' memo is illustrative. It demanded the attention of his supervisors and
led to a heated meeting with employees from the sheriff's department. If
Ceballos' superiors thought his memo was inflammatory or misguided, they had
the authority to take proper corrective action.
Ceballos' proposed contrary rule, adopted by the Court of Appeals, would
commit state and federal courts to a new, permanent, and intrusive role,
mandating judicial oversight of communications between and among
government employees and their superiors in the course of official business.
This displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision finds no
support in our precedents. When an employee speaks as a citizen addressing a
matter of public concern, the First Amendment requires a delicate balancing of
the competing interests surrounding the speech and its consequences. When,
however, the employee is simply performing his or her job duties, there is no
warrant for a similar degree of scrutiny. To hold otherwise would be to demand
permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations to a
degree inconsistent with sound principles of federalism and the separation of
powers.
*** Proper application of our precedents thus leads to the conclusion that the
First Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an
employee's expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities. Because
Ceballos' memo falls into this category, his allegation of unconstitutional
retaliation must fail.
Two final points warrant mentioning. First, as indicated above, the parties in
this case do not dispute that Ceballos wrote his disposition memo pursuant to
his employment duties. We thus have no occasion to articulate a comprehensive
framework for defining the scope of an employee's duties in cases where there is
room for serious debate. We reject, however, the suggestion that employers can
restrict employees' rights by creating excessively broad job descriptions. The
proper inquiry is a practical one. Formal job descriptions often bear little
resemblance to the duties an employee actually is expected to perform, and the
listing of a given task in an employee's written job description is neither
necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that conducting the task is within the
scope of the employee's professional duties for First Amendment purposes.
Second, Justice Souter [dissenting] suggests today's decision may have
important ramifications for academic freedom, at least as a constitutional value.
There is some argument that expression related to academic scholarship or
classroom instruction implicates additional constitutional interests that are not
fully accounted for by this Court's customary employee-speech jurisprudence.

Robson

309

The First Amendment

We need not, and for that reason do not, decide whether the analysis we
conduct today would apply in the same manner to a case involving speech
related to scholarship or teaching.
IV
Exposing governmental inefficiency and misconduct is a matter of considerable
significance. *** These imperatives, as well as obligations arising from any other
applicable constitutional provisions and mandates of the criminal and civil laws,
protect employees and provide checks on supervisors who would order unlawful
or otherwise inappropriate actions.
We reject, however, the notion that the First Amendment shields from discipline
the expressions employees make pursuant to their professional duties. Our
precedents do not support the existence of a constitutional cause of action
behind every statement a public employee makes in the course of doing his or
her job.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS, DISSENTING [OMITTED]
JUSTICE SOUTER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEVENS AND JUSTICE GINSBURG JOIN,
DISSENTING.
The Court holds that "when public employees make statements pursuant to
their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First
Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their
communications from employer discipline." I respectfully dissent. I agree with
the majority that a government employer has substantial interests in
effectuating its chosen policy and objectives, and in demanding competence,
honesty, and judgment from employees who speak for it in doing their work.
But I would hold that private and public interests in addressing official
wrongdoing and threats to health and safety can outweigh the government's
stake in the efficient implementation of policy, and when they do public
employees who speak on these matters in the course of their duties should be
eligible to claim First Amendment protection.
I
Open speech by a private citizen on a matter of public importance lies at the
heart of expression subject to protection by the First Amendment. At the other
extreme, a statement by a government employee complaining about nothing
beyond treatment under personnel rules raises no greater claim to
constitutional protection against retaliatory response than the remarks of a
private employee. In between these points lies a public employee's speech
unwelcome to the government but on a significant public issue. Such an
employee speaking as a citizen, that is, with a citizen's interest, is protected
from reprisal unless the statements are too damaging to the government's

Robson

310

The First Amendment

capacity to conduct public business to be justified by any individual or public
benefit thought to flow from the statements. Entitlement to protection is thus
not absolute.
This significant, albeit qualified, protection of public employees who irritate the
government is understood to flow from the First Amendment, in part, because a
government paycheck does nothing to eliminate the value to an individual of
speaking on public matters, and there is no good reason for categorically
discounting a speaker's interest in commenting on a matter of public concern
just because the government employs him. Still, the First Amendment
safeguard rests on something more, being the value to the public of receiving
the opinions and information that a public employee may disclose. "Government
employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for
which they work." ***
The difference between a case like Givhan and this one is that the subject of
Ceballos's speech fell within the scope of his job responsibilities, whereas
choosing personnel was not what the teacher was hired to do. The effect of the
majority's constitutional line between these two cases, then, is that a Givhan
schoolteacher is protected when complaining to the principal about hiring
policy, but a school personnel officer would not be if he protested that the
principal disapproved of hiring minority job applicants. This is an odd place to
draw a distinction, and while necessary judicial line-drawing sometimes looks
arbitrary, any distinction obliges a court to justify its choice. Here, there is no
adequate justification for the majority's line categorically denying Pickering
protection to any speech uttered "pursuant to . . . official duties.”
As all agree, the qualified speech protection embodied in Pickering balancing
resolves the tension between individual and public interests in the speech, on
the one hand, and the government's interest in operating efficiently without
distraction or embarrassment by talkative or headline-grabbing employees. The
need for a balance hardly disappears when an employee speaks on matters his
job requires him to address; rather, it seems obvious that the individual and
public value of such speech is no less, and may well be greater, when the
employee speaks pursuant to his duties in addressing a subject he knows
intimately for the very reason that it falls within his duties.
As for the importance of such speech to the individual, it stands to reason that
a citizen may well place a very high value on a right to speak on the public
issues he decides to make the subject of his work day after day. Would anyone
doubt that a school principal evaluating the performance of teachers for
promotion or pay adjustment retains a citizen's interest in addressing the
quality of teaching in the schools? (Still, the majority indicates he could be fired
without First Amendment recourse for fair but unfavorable comment when the
teacher under review is the superintendent's daughter.) Would anyone deny
that a prosecutor like Richard Ceballos may claim the interest of any citizen in
speaking out against a rogue law enforcement officer, simply because his job
requires him to express a judgment about the officer's performance? (But the
majority says the First Amendment gives Ceballos no protection, even if his
judgment in this case was sound and appropriately expressed.)

Robson

311

The First Amendment

Indeed, the very idea of categorically separating the citizen's interest from the
employee's interest ignores the fact that the ranks of public service include
those who share the poet's "object . . . to unite [m]y avocation and my vocation";
these citizen servants are the ones whose civic interest rises highest when they
speak pursuant to their duties, and these are exactly the ones government
employers most want to attract. There is no question that public employees
speaking on matters they are obliged to address would generally place a high
value on a right to speak, as any responsible citizen would.
Nor is there any reason to raise the counterintuitive question whether the
public interest in hearing informed employees evaporates when they speak as
required on some subject at the core of their jobs. ***
Nothing, then, accountable on the individual and public side of the Pickering
balance changes when an employee speaks "pursuant" to public duties. On the
side of the government employer, however, something is different, and to this
extent, I agree with the majority of the Court. The majority is rightly concerned
that the employee who speaks out on matters subject to comment in doing his
own work has the greater leverage to create office uproars and fracture the
government's authority to set policy to be carried out coherently through the
ranks. *** Up to a point, then, the majority makes good points: government
needs civility in the workplace, consistency in policy, and honesty and
competence in public service.
But why do the majority's concerns, which we all share, require categorical
exclusion of First Amendment protection against any official retaliation for
things said on the job? Is it not possible to respect the unchallenged individual
and public interests in the speech through a Pickering balance without drawing
the strange line I mentioned before? This is, to be sure, a matter of judgment,
but the judgment has to account for the undoubted value of speech to those,
and by those, whose specific public job responsibilities bring them face to face
with wrongdoing and incompetence in government, who refuse to avert their
eyes and shut their mouths. And it has to account for the need actually to
disrupt government if its officials are corrupt or dangerously incompetent. It is
thus no adequate justification for the suppression of potentially valuable
information simply to recognize that the government has a huge interest in
managing its employees and preventing the occasionally irresponsible one from
turning his job into a bully pulpit. Even there, the lesson of Pickering (and the
object of most constitutional adjudication) is still to the point: when
constitutionally significant interests clash, resist the demand for winner-takeall; try to make adjustments that serve all of the values at stake. ***
II
The majority seeks support in two lines of argument extraneous to Pickering
doctrine. The one turns on a fallacious reading of cases on government speech,
the other on a mistaken assessment of protection available under whistleblower statutes.
A
The majority accepts the fallacy propounded by the county petitioners and the
Federal Government as amicus that any statement made within the scope of

Robson

312

The First Amendment

public employment is (or should be treated as) the government's own speech,
and should thus be differentiated as a matter of law from the personal
statements the First Amendment protects. The majority invokes *** Rust v.
Sullivan (1991) [Chapter 6] which held there was no infringement of the speech
rights of Title X funds recipients and their staffs when the Government forbade
any on-the-job counseling in favor of abortion as a method of family planning.
We have read Rust to mean that "when the government appropriates public
funds to promote a particular policy of its own it is entitled to say what it
wishes."
The key to understanding the difference between this case and Rust lies in the
terms of the respective employees' jobs and, in particular, the extent to which
those terms require espousal of a substantive position prescribed by the
government in advance. Some public employees are hired to "promote a
particular policy" by broadcasting a particular message set by the government,
but not everyone working for the government, after all, is hired to speak from a
government manifesto. See Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez (2001)
[Chapter 6]. There is no claim or indication that Ceballos was hired to perform
such a speaking assignment. He was paid to enforce the law by constitutional
action: to exercise the county government's prosecutorial power by acting
honestly, competently, and constitutionally. The only sense in which his
position apparently required him to hew to a substantive message was at the
relatively abstract point of favoring respect for law and its evenhanded
enforcement, subjects that are not at the level of controversy in this case and
were not in Rust. Unlike the doctors in Rust, Ceballos was not paid to advance
one specific policy among those legitimately available, defined by a specific
message or limited by a particular message forbidden. The county government's
interest in his speech cannot therefore be equated with the terms of a specific,
prescribed, or forbidden substantive position comparable to the Federal
Government's interest in Rust, and Rust is no authority for the notion that
government may exercise plenary control over every comment made by a public
employee in doing his job. ***
B
The majority's second argument for its disputed limitation of Pickering doctrine
is that the First Amendment has little or no work to do here owing to an
assertedly comprehensive complement of state and national statutes protecting
government whistle-blowers from vindictive bosses. But even if I close my eyes
to the tenet that "`[t]he applicability of a provision of the Constitution has never
depended on the vagaries of state or federal law,'" the majority's counsel to rest
easy fails on its own terms.
To begin with, speech addressing official wrongdoing may well fall outside
protected whistle-blowing, defined in the classic sense of exposing an official's
fault to a third party or to the public; the teacher in Givhan, for example, who
raised the issue of unconstitutional hiring bias, would not have qualified as
that sort of whistle-blower, for she was fired after a private conversation with
the school principal. In any event, the combined variants of statutory whistleblower definitions and protections add up to a patchwork, not a showing that
worries may be remitted to legislatures for relief. See D. WESTMAN & N. MODESITT,
WHISTLEBLOWING: LAW OF RETALIATORY DISCHARGE 67-75, 281-307 (2d ed. 2004).

Robson

313

The First Amendment

Some state statutes protect all government workers, including the employees of
municipalities and other subdivisions; others stop at state employees. Some
limit protection to employees who tell their bosses before they speak out; others
forbid bosses from imposing any requirement to warn. As for the federal
Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, 5 U. S. C. § 1213 et seq. (2000 ed. and
Supp. III), current case law requires an employee complaining of retaliation to
show that “ ‘a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts
known to and readily ascertainable by the employee [could] reasonably
conclude that the actions of the government evidence gross mismanagement.’”
And federal employees have been held to have no protection for disclosures
made to immediate supervisors, or for statements of facts publicly known
already. Most significantly, federal employees have been held to be unprotected
for statements made in connection with normal employment duties, the very
speech that the majority says will be covered by "the powerful network of
legislative enactments . . . available to those who seek to expose wrongdoing."
My point is not to disparage particular statutes or speak here to the merits of
interpretations by other federal courts, but merely to show the current
understanding of statutory protection: individuals doing the same sorts of
governmental jobs and saying the same sorts of things addressed to civic
concerns will get different protection depending on the local, state, or federal
jurisdictions that happened to employ them.
III
The Court remands because the Court of Appeals considered only the
disposition memorandum and because Ceballos charges retaliation for some
speech apparently outside the ambit of utterances "pursuant to their official
duties." When the Court of Appeals takes up this case once again, it should
consider some of the following facts that escape emphasis in the majority
opinion owing to its focus. Ceballos says he sought his position out of a
personal commitment to perform civic work. After showing his superior,
petitioner Frank Sundstedt, the disposition memorandum at issue in this case,
Ceballos complied with Sundstedt's direction to tone down some accusatory
rhetoric out of concern that the memorandum would be unnecessarily
incendiary when shown to the Sheriff's Department. After meeting with
members of that department, Ceballos told his immediate supervisor, petitioner
Carol Najera, that he thought Brady v. Maryland (1963), obliged him to give the
defense his internal memorandum as exculpatory evidence. He says that Najera
responded by ordering him to write a new memorandum containing nothing but
the deputy sheriff's statements, but that he balked at that. Instead, he
proposed to turn over the existing memorandum with his own conclusions
redacted as work product, and this is what he did. The issue over revealing his
conclusions arose again in preparing for the suppression hearing. Ceballos
maintains that Sundstedt ordered Najera, representing the prosecution, to give
the trial judge a full picture of the circumstances, but that Najera told Ceballos
he would suffer retaliation if he testified that the affidavit contained intentional
fabrications. In any event, Ceballos's testimony generally stopped short of his
own conclusions. After the hearing, the trial judge denied the motion to
suppress, explaining that he found grounds independent of the challenged
material sufficient to show probable cause for the warrant.

Robson

314

The First Amendment

Ceballos says that over the next six months his supervisors retaliated against
him not only for his written reports, but also for his spoken statements to them
and his hearing testimony in the pending criminal case. While an internal
grievance filed by Ceballos challenging these actions was pending, Ceballos
spoke at a meeting of the Mexican-American Bar Association about misconduct
of the Sheriff's Department in the criminal case, the lack of any policy at the
District Attorney's Office for handling allegations of police misconduct, and the
retaliatory acts he ascribed to his supervisors. Two days later, the office
dismissed Ceballos's grievance, a result he attributes in part to his bar
association speech.
Ceballos's action against petitioners under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 claims that the
individuals retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment rights in
submitting the memorandum, discussing the matter with Najera and Sundstedt,
testifying truthfully at the hearing, and speaking at the bar meeting. As I
mentioned, the Court of Appeals saw no need to address the protection afforded
to Ceballos's statements other than the disposition memorandum, which it
thought was protected under the Pickering test. Upon remand, it will be open to
the Court of Appeals to consider the application of Pickering to any retaliation
shown for other statements; not all of those statements would have been made
pursuant to official duties in any obvious sense, and the claim relating to
truthful testimony in court must surely be analyzed independently to protect
the integrity of the judicial process.
JUSTICE BREYER, DISSENTING.
This case asks whether the First Amendment protects public employees when
they engage in speech that both (1) involves matters of public concern and (2)
takes place in the ordinary course of performing the duties of a government job.
I write separately to explain why I cannot fully accept either the Court's or
Justice Souter's answer to the question presented.
*** Nonetheless, there may well be circumstances with special demand for
constitutional protection of the speech at issue, where governmental
justifications may be limited, and where administrable standards seem readily
available—to the point where the majority's fears of department management by
lawsuit are misplaced. In such an instance, I believe that courts should apply
the Pickering standard, even though the government employee speaks upon
matters of public concern in the course of his ordinary duties.
This is such a case. The respondent, a government lawyer, complained of
retaliation, in part, on the basis of speech contained in his disposition
memorandum that he says fell within the scope of his obligations under Brady
v. Maryland (1963). The facts present two special circumstances that together
justify First Amendment review.
First, the speech at issue is professional speech—the speech of a lawyer. Such
speech is subject to independent regulation by canons of the profession. Those
canons provide an obligation to speak in certain instances. And where that is so,
the government's own interest in forbidding that speech is diminished. The
objective specificity and public availability of the profession's canons also help

Robson

315

The First Amendment

to diminish the risk that the courts will improperly interfere with the
government's necessary authority to manage its work.
Second, the Constitution itself here imposes speech obligations upon the
government's professional employee. A prosecutor has a constitutional
obligation to learn of, to preserve, and to communicate with the defense about
exculpatory and impeachment evidence in the government's possession. So, for
example, might a prison doctor have a similar constitutionally related
professional obligation to communicate with superiors about seriously unsafe
or unsanitary conditions in the cellblock. There may well be other examples.
Where professional and special constitutional obligations are both present, the
need to protect the employee's speech is augmented, the need for broad
government authority to control that speech is likely diminished, and
administrable standards are quite likely available. Hence, I would find that the
Constitution mandates special protection of employee speech in such
circumstances. Thus I would apply the Pickering balancing test here. ***

SOTOMAYOR, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION FOR A UNANIMOUS COURT. THOMAS, J., FILED A
CONCURRING OPINION, IN WHICH SCALIA AND ALITO, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Almost 50 years ago, this Court declared that citizens do not surrender their
First Amendment rights by accepting public employment. Rather, the First
Amendment protection of a public employee's speech depends on a careful
balance "between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting
upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in
promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its
employees." Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.
(1968). In Pickering, the Court struck the balance in favor of the public
employee, extending First Amendment protection to a teacher who was fired
after writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper criticizing the school
board that employed him. Today, we consider whether the First Amendment
similarly protects a public employee who provided truthful sworn testimony,
compelled by subpoena, outside the course of his ordinary job responsibilities.
We hold that it does.
I
In 2006, Central Alabama Community College (CACC) hired petitioner Edward
Lane to be the Director of Community Intensive Training for Youth (CITY), a
statewide program for underprivileged youth. CACC hired Lane on a
probationary basis. In his capacity as Director, Lane was responsible for
overseeing CITY's day-to-day operations, hiring and firing employees, and
making decisions with respect to the program's finances.
At the time of Lane's appointment, CITY faced significant financial difficulties.
That prompted Lane to conduct a comprehensive audit of the program's

Robson

316

The First Amendment

expenses. The audit revealed that Suzanne Schmitz, an Alabama State
Representative on CITY's payroll, had not been reporting to her CITY office.
After unfruitful discussions with Schmitz, Lane shared his finding with CACC's
president and its attorney. They warned him that firing Schmitz could have
negative repercussions for him and CACC.
Lane nonetheless contacted Schmitz again and instructed her to show up to the
Huntsville office to serve as a counselor. Schmitz refused; she responded that
she wished to " 'continue to serve the CITY program in the same manner as [she
had] in the past.' " Lane fired her shortly thereafter. Schmitz told another CITY
employee, Charles Foley, that she intended to " 'get [Lane] back' " for firing her.
She also said that if Lane ever requested money from the state legislature for
the program, she would tell him, " '[y]ou're fired.' "
Schmitz' termination drew the attention of many, including agents of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, which initiated an investigation into Schmitz'
employment with CITY. In November 2006, Lane testified before a federal grand
jury about his reasons for firing Schmitz. In January 2008, the grand jury
indicted Schmitz on four counts of mail fraud and four counts of theft
concerning a program receiving federal funds. The indictment alleged that
Schmitz had collected $177,251.82 in federal funds even though she performed
" 'virtually no services,' " " 'generated virtually no work product,' " and " 'rarely
even appeared for work at the CITY Program offices.' " Id., at 1260. It further
alleged that Schmitz had submitted false statements concerning the hours she
worked and the nature of the services she performed.
Schmitz' trial, which garnered extensive press coverage, commenced in August
2008. Lane testified, under subpoena, regarding the events that led to his
terminating Schmitz. The jury failed to reach a verdict. Roughly six months
later, federal prosecutors retried Schmitz, and Lane testified once again. This
time, the jury convicted Schmitz on three counts of mail fraud and four counts
of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds. The District Court
sentenced her to 30 months in prison and ordered her to pay $177,251.82 in
restitution and forfeiture.
Meanwhile, CITY continued to experience considerable budget shortfalls. In
November 2008, Lane began reporting to respondent Steve Franks, who had
become president of CACC in January 2008. Lane recommended that Franks
consider layoffs to address the financial difficulties. In January 2009, Franks
decided to terminate 29 probationary CITY employees, including Lane. Shortly
thereafter, however, Franks rescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminations--those of
Lane and one other employee-- because of an "ambiguity in [those other
employees'] probationary service." Brief for Respondent Franks 11. Franks
claims that he "did not rescind Lane's termination . . . because he believed that
Lane was in a fundamentally different category than the other employees: he
was the director of the entire CITY program, and not simply an employee." In
September 2009, CACC eliminated the CITY program and terminated the
program's remaining employees. Franks later retired, and respondent Susan
Burrow, the current Acting President of CACC, replaced him while this case was
pending before the Eleventh Circuit.

Robson

317

The First Amendment

In January 2011, Lane sued Franks in his individual and official capacities
alleging that Franks had violated the First Amendment by firing him in
retaliation for his testimony against Schmitz. Lane sought damages from
Franks in his individual capacity and sought equitable relief, including
reinstatement, from Franks in his official capacity.
The District Court granted Franks' motion for summary judgment. Although the
court concluded that the record raised "genuine issues of material fact . . .
concerning [Franks'] true motivation for terminating [Lane's] employment," it
held that Franks was entitled to qualified immunity as to the damages claims
because "a reasonable government official in [Franks'] position would not have
had reason to believe that the Constitution protected [Lane's] testimony." The
District Court relied on Garcetti v. Ceballos (2006), which held that " 'when
public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the
employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes.' " The
court found no violation of clearly established law because Lane had "learned of
the information that he testified about while working as Director at [CITY],"
such that his "speech [could] still be considered as part of his official job duties
and not made as a citizen on a matter of public concern.".
The Eleventh Circuit affirmed [in a summary opinion without oral argument].
*** We granted certiorari to resolve discord among the Courts of Appeals as to
whether public employees may be fired--or suffer other adverse employment
consequences--for providing truthful subpoenaed testimony outside the course
of their ordinary job responsibilities.
II
Speech by citizens on matters of public concern lies at the heart of the First
Amendment, which "was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for
the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people," Roth v.
United States (1957). This remains true when speech concerns information
related to or learned through public employment. After all, public employees do
not renounce their citizenship when they accept employment, and this Court
has cautioned time and again that public employers may not condition
employment on the relinquishment of constitutional rights. There is
considerable value, moreover, in encouraging, rather than inhibiting, speech by
public employees. For "[g]overnment employees are often in the best position to
know what ails the agencies for which they work." "The interest at stake is as
much the public's interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employee's
own right to disseminate it."
Our precedents have also acknowledged the government's countervailing
interest in controlling the operation of its workplaces. "Government employers,
like private employers, need a significant degree of control over their employees'
words and actions; without it, there would be little chance for the efficient
provision of public services."
Pickering provides the framework for analyzing whether the employee's interest
or the government's interest should prevail in cases where the government
seeks to curtail the speech of its employees. It requires "balanc[ing] . . . the
interests of the [public employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of

Robson

318

The First Amendment

public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the
efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees."***
In Garcetti, we described a two-step inquiry into whether a public employee's
speech is entitled to protection:
"The first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a
matter of public concern. If the answer is no, the employee has no First
Amendment cause of action based on his or her employer's reaction to the
speech. If the answer is yes, then the possibility of a First Amendment claim
arises. The question becomes whether the relevant government entity had an
adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other
member of the general public."

In describing the first step in this inquiry, Garcetti distinguished between
employee speech and citizen speech. Whereas speech as a citizen may trigger
protection, the Court held that "when public employees make statements
pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for
First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their
communications from employer discipline." Applying that rule to the facts
before it, the Court found that an internal memorandum prepared by a
prosecutor in the course of his ordinary job responsibilities constituted
unprotected employee speech.
III
Against this backdrop, we turn to the question presented: whether the First
Amendment protects a public employee who provides truthful sworn testimony,
compelled by subpoena, outside the scope of his ordinary job responsibilities.
We hold that it does.
A
The first inquiry is whether the speech in question--Lane's testimony at
Schmitz' trials--is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern. It clearly is.
1
Truthful testimony under oath by a public employee outside the scope of his
ordinary job duties is speech as a citizen for First Amendment purposes. That is
so even when the testimony relates to his public employment or concerns
information learned during that employment.
In rejecting Lane's argument that his testimony was speech as a citizen, the
Eleventh Circuit gave short shrift to the nature of sworn judicial statements
and ignored the obligation borne by all witnesses testifying under oath. Sworn
testimony in judicial proceedings is a quintessential example of speech as a
citizen for a simple reason: Anyone who testifies in court bears an obligation, to
the court and society at large, to tell the truth. When the person testifying is a
public employee, he may bear separate obligations to his employer--for example,
an obligation not to show up to court dressed in an unprofessional manner. But
any such obligations as an employee are distinct and independent from the
obligation, as a citizen, to speak the truth. That independent obligation renders
sworn testimony speech as a citizen and sets it apart from speech made purely
in the capacity of an employee.

The First Amendment

In holding that Lane did not speak as a citizen when he testified, the Eleventh
Circuit read Garcetti far too broadly. *** The sworn testimony in this case is far
removed from the speech at issue in Garcetti--an internal memorandum
prepared by a deputy district attorney for his supervisors recommending
dismissal of a particular prosecution. ***
But Garcetti said nothing about speech that simply relates to public
employment or concerns information learned in the course of public
employment. The Garcetti Court made explicit that its holding did not turn on
the fact that the memo at issue "concerned the subject matter of [the
prosecutor's] employment," because "[t]he First Amendment protects some
expressions related to the speaker's job." In other words, the mere fact that a
citizen's speech concerns information acquired by virtue of his public
employment does not transform that speech into employee--rather than citizen-speech. The critical question under Garcetti is whether the speech at issue is
itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee's duties, not whether it merely
concerns those duties.
It bears emphasis that our precedents dating back to Pickering have recognized
that speech by public employees on subject matter related to their employment
holds special value precisely because those employees gain knowledge of
matters of public concern through their employment. In Pickering, for example,
the Court observed that "[t]eachers are . . . the members of a community most
likely to have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the
operation of the schools should be spent. Accordingly, it is essential that they
be able to speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory
dismissal." Most recently, in San Diego v. Roe, the Court again observed that
public employees "are uniquely qualified to comment" on "matters concerning
government policies that are of interest to the public at large."
The importance of public employee speech is especially evident in the context of
this case: a public corruption scandal. The United States, for example,
represents that because "[t]he more than 1000 prosecutions for federal
corruption offenses that are brought in a typical year . . . often depend on
evidence about activities that government officials undertook while in office,"
those prosecutions often "require testimony from other government employees."
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae. It would be antithetical to our
jurisprudence to conclude that the very kind of speech necessary to prosecute
corruption by public officials--speech by public employees regarding
information learned through their employment--may never form the basis for a
First Amendment retaliation claim. Such a rule would place public employees
who witness corruption in an impossible position, torn between the obligation
to testify truthfully and the desire to avoid retaliation and keep their jobs.
Applying these principles, it is clear that Lane's sworn testimony is speech as a
citizen.
2
Lane's testimony is also speech on a matter of public concern. Speech involves
matters of public concern "when it can 'be fairly considered as relating to any
matter of political, social, or other concern to the community,' or when it 'is a
subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of general interest and of

Robson

320

The First Amendment

value and concern to the public.' " Snyder v. Phelps (2011) [Chapter 7]. The
inquiry turns on the "content, form, and context" of the speech. Connick.
The content of Lane's testimony--corruption in a public program and misuse of
state funds--obviously involves a matter of significant public concern. And the
form and context of the speech--sworn testimony in a judicial proceeding-fortify that conclusion. "Unlike speech in other contexts, testimony under oath
has the formality and gravity necessary to remind the witness that his or her
statements will be the basis for official governmental action, action that often
affects the rights and liberties of others." United States v. Alvarez (2013)
[Chapter 3].
We hold, then, that Lane's truthful sworn testimony at Schmitz' criminal trials
is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern.
B
This does not settle the matter, however. A public employee's sworn testimony
is not categorically entitled to First Amendment protection simply because it is
speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern. Under Pickering, if an
employee speaks as a citizen on a matter of public concern, the next question is
whether the government had "an adequate justification for treating the
employee differently from any other member of the public" based on the
government's needs as an employer.
As discussed previously, we have recognized that government employers often
have legitimate "interest[s] in the effective and efficient fulfillment of [their]
responsibilities to the public," including " 'promot[ing] efficiency and integrity in
the discharge of official duties,' " and " 'maintain[ing] proper discipline in public
service.' " Connick, We have also cautioned, however, that "a stronger showing
[of government interests] may be necessary if the employee's speech more
substantially involve[s] matters of public concern." Id.
Here, the employer's side of the Pickering scale is entirely empty: Respondents
do not assert, and cannot demonstrate, any government interest that tips the
balance in their favor. There is no evidence, for example, that Lane's testimony
at Schmitz' trials was false or erroneous or that Lane unnecessarily disclosed
any sensitive, confidential, or privileged information while testifying. In these
circumstances, we conclude that Lane's speech is entitled to protection under
the First Amendment. The Eleventh Circuit erred in holding otherwise and
dismissing Lane's claim of retaliation on that basis.
IV
Respondent Franks argues that even if Lane's testimony is protected under the
First Amendment, the claims against him in his individual capacity should be
dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity. We agree. ***
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

JUSTICE THOMAS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE SCALIA AND JUSTICE ALITO JOIN, CONCURRING.
This case presents the discrete question whether a public employee speaks "as
a citizen on a matter of public concern," when the employee gives "[t]ruthful
testimony under oath . . . outside the scope of his ordinary job duties."
Answering that question requires little more than a straightforward application
of Garcetti. ***
We accordingly have no occasion to address the quite different question
whether a public employee speaks "as a citizen" when he testifies in the course
of his ordinary job responsibilities. For some public employees--such as police
officers, crime scene technicians, and laboratory analysts--testifying is a routine
and critical part of their employment duties. Others may be called to testify in
the context of particular litigation as the designated representatives of their
employers. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 30(b)(6). The Court properly leaves the
constitutional questions raised by these scenarios for another day.

Notes	  	  
1.
Garcetti v. Ceballos was argued in October 2005 and reargued in
March 2006. The intervening event necessitating reargument was the
retirement of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and her replacement by
Justice Samuel Alito. This change in Justices may also have changed
the outcome in the case.
Based on the timing and practice of opinion assignments, at least one
Court-watcher believes that Justice Souter originally had been assigned
the majority opinion (in which O’Connor joined). Justice Kennedy, who
had been assigned another majority opinion from that October sitting
was writing a dissenting opinion, but Alito’s preference for Kennedy’s
position transformed Kennedy’s opinion into the Court’s opinion. See
Karl Blanke, The Effect of Justice Alito, ScotusBlog, June 27, 2006,

However, even in the original oral argument there was some
concern about the breadth of “public concern” in a government office.
Both Justice Breyer and Chief Justice Roberts proffered brief examples
using their own offices and law clerks. Here is a portion of the Roberts
colloquy with the attorney for Ceballos:
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Government misconduct -- if I get a memo
from a law clerk that says, "Justice So-and-So's jurisprudence is wacky," that
goes to -[Laughter.] -- that goes to Government misconduct, under your theory, right?
And I fire them, because I think that's not appropriate to put in a memo.

interest. What could be more important than how the Court decides cases? And
that violates their first-amendment rights.

How would you respond?
3.
After Garcetti v. Ceballos, the term “Garcettized” began to be used
by some as many courts began to routinely deny First Amendment
protection to employees for any statements made related to employment.
Indeed, one might view Edward Lane’s claims as having been
“Garcettized” when the district judge entered summary judgment in favor
of the employer and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in a per curiam
opinion without oral argument.
4.
In Lane v. Franks the Court found that the Eleventh Circuit read
Garcetti “far too broadly” and unanimously concluded that resolving the
issue in Lane v. Franks “requires little more than a straightforward
application of Garcetti.”
Why then does the Court hold that the
defendants are entitled to qualified immunity?

District	  
393 U.S. 503 (1969)

FORTAS, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH WARREN, C.J., DOUGLAS,
BRENNAN, WHITE, AND MARSHALL, J.J., JOINED. STEWART, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION.
BLACK, J., AND HARLAN, J., FILED DISSENTING OPINIONS.

JUSTICE FORTAS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Petitioner John F. Tinker, 15 years old, and petitioner Christopher Eckhardt, 16
years old, attended high schools in Des Moines, Iowa. Petitioner Mary Beth
Tinker, John's sister, was a 13-year-old student in junior high school.
In December, 1965, a group of adults and students in Des Moines held a
meeting at the Eckhardt home. The group determined to publicize their
objections to the hostilities in Vietnam and their support for a truce by wearing
black armbands during the holiday season and by fasting on December 16 and
New Year's Eve. Petitioners and their parents had previously engaged in similar
activities, and they decided to participate in the program.
The principals of the Des Moines schools became aware of the plan to wear
armbands. On December 14, 1965, they met and adopted a policy that any
student wearing an armband to school would be asked to remove it, and, if he

Robson

323

The First Amendment

refused, he would be suspended until he returned without the armband.
Petitioners were aware of the regulation that the school authorities adopted.
On December 16, Mary Beth and Christopher wore black armbands to their
schools. John Tinker wore his armband the next day. They were all sent home
and suspended from school until they would come back without their
armbands. They did not return to school until after the planned period for
wearing armbands had expired -- that is, until after New Year's Day.
This complaint was filed in the United States District Court by petitioners,
through their fathers, under § 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code. It
prayed for an injunction restraining the respondent school officials and the
respondent members of the board of directors of the school district from
disciplining the petitioners, and it sought nominal damages. After an
evidentiary hearing, the District Court dismissed the complaint. It upheld the
constitutionality of the school authorities' action on the ground that it was
reasonable in order to prevent disturbance of school discipline. The court
referred to, but expressly declined to follow, the Fifth Circuit's holding in a
similar case that the wearing of symbols like the armbands cannot be
prohibited unless it "materially and substantially interfere[s] with the
requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school." Burnside
v. Byars, 363 F.2d 744, 749 (1966).
On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit considered the case en
banc. The court was equally divided, and the District Court's decision was
accordingly affirmed without opinion. We granted certiorari.
I
The District Court recognized that the wearing of an armband for the purpose of
expressing certain views is the type of symbolic act that is within the Free
Speech Clause of the First Amendment. As we shall discuss, the wearing of
armbands in the circumstances of this case was entirely divorced from actually
or potentially disruptive conduct by those participating in it. It was closely akin
to "pure speech" which, we have repeatedly held, is entitled to comprehensive
protection under the First Amendment.
First Amendment rights, applied in light of the special characteristics of the
school environment, are available to teachers and students. It can hardly be
argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to
freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate. This has been the
unmistakable holding of this Court for almost 50 years. In Meyer v. Nebraska
(1923) and Bartels v. Iowa (1923), this Court, in opinions by Mr. Justice
McReynolds, held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
prevents States from forbidding the teaching of a foreign language to young
students. Statutes to this effect, the Court held, unconstitutionally interfere
with the liberty of teacher, student, and parent. See also Pierce v. Society of
Sisters (1925). ***
In West Virginia v. Barnette (1943) [Chapter 6] this Court held that, under the
First Amendment, the student in public school may not be compelled to salute
the flag. *** *** On the other hand, the Court has repeatedly emphasized the
need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school

Robson

The First Amendment

officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe
and control conduct in the schools. Our problem lies in the area where
students in the exercise of First Amendment rights collide with the rules of the
school authorities.
II
The problem posed by the present case does not relate to regulation of the
length of skirts or the type of clothing, to hair style, or deportment. It does not
concern aggressive, disruptive action or even group demonstrations. Our
problem involves direct, primary First Amendment rights akin to "pure speech."
The school officials banned and sought to punish petitioners for a silent,
passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance
on the part of petitioners. There is here no evidence whatever of petitioners'
interference, actual or nascent, with the schools' work or of collision with the
rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone. Accordingly, this case
does not concern speech or action that intrudes upon the work of the schools or
the rights of other students.
Only a few of the 18,000 students in the school system wore the black
armbands. Only five students were suspended for wearing them. There is no
indication that the work of the schools or any class was disrupted. Outside the
classrooms, a few students made hostile remarks to the children wearing
armbands, but there were no threats or acts of violence on school premises.
The District Court concluded that the action of the school authorities was
reasonable because it was based upon their fear of a disturbance from the
wearing of the armbands. But, in our system, undifferentiated fear or
apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of
expression. Any departure from absolute regimentation may cause trouble. Any
variation from the majority's opinion may inspire fear. Any word spoken, in
class, in the lunchroom, or on the campus, that deviates from the views of
another person may start an argument or cause a disturbance. But our
Constitution says we must take this risk and our history says that it is this sort
of hazardous freedom -- this kind of openness -- that is the basis of our
national strength and of the independence and vigor of Americans who grow up
and live in this relatively permissive, often disputatious, society.
In order for the State in the person of school officials to justify prohibition of a
particular expression of opinion, it must be able to show that its action was
caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and
unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint. Certainly
where there is no finding and no showing that engaging in the forbidden
conduct would "materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of
appropriate discipline in the operation of the school," the prohibition cannot be
sustained.
In the present case, the District Court made no such finding, and our
independent examination of the record fails to yield evidence that the school
authorities had reason to anticipate that the wearing of the armbands would
substantially interfere with the work of the school or impinge upon the rights of
other students. Even an official memorandum prepared after the suspension

Robson

325

The First Amendment

that listed the reasons for the ban on wearing the armbands made no reference
to the anticipation of such disruption.
On the contrary, the action of the school authorities appears to have been
based upon an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from
the expression, even by the silent symbol of armbands, of opposition to this
Nation's part in the conflagration in Vietnam. It is revealing, in this respect,
that the meeting at which the school principals decided to issue the contested
regulation was called in response to a student's statement to the journalism
teacher in one of the schools that he wanted to write an article on Vietnam and
have it published in the school paper. (The student was dissuaded.)
It is also relevant that the school authorities did not purport to prohibit the
wearing of all symbols of political or controversial significance. The record
shows that students in some of the schools wore buttons relating to national
political campaigns, and some even wore the Iron Cross, traditionally a symbol
of Nazism. The order prohibiting the wearing of armbands did not extend to
these. Instead, a particular symbol -- black armbands worn to exhibit
opposition to this Nation's involvement in Vietnam -- was singled out for
prohibition. Clearly, the prohibition of expression of one particular opinion, at
least without evidence that it is necessary to avoid material and substantial
interference with schoolwork or discipline, is not constitutionally permissible.
In our system, state-operated schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism.
School officials do not possess absolute authority over their students. Students
in school, as well as out of school, are "persons" under our Constitution. They
are possessed of fundamental rights which the State must respect, just as they
themselves must respect their obligations to the State. In our system, students
may not be regarded as closed-circuit recipients of only that which the State
chooses to communicate. They may not be confined to the expression of those
sentiments that are officially approved. In the absence of a specific showing of
constitutionally valid reasons to regulate their speech, students are entitled to
freedom of expression of their views. ***
The principle of these cases is not confined to the supervised and ordained
discussion which takes place in the classroom. The principal use to which the
schools are dedicated is to accommodate students during prescribed hours for
the purpose of certain types of activities. Among those activities is personal
intercommunication among the students. This is not only an inevitable part of
the process of attending school; it is also an important part of the educational
process. A student's rights, therefore, do not embrace merely the classroom
hours. When he is in the cafeteria, or on the playing field, or on the campus
during the authorized hours, he may express his opinions, even on
controversial subjects like the conflict in Vietnam, if he does so without
"materially and substantially interfer[ing] with the requirements of appropriate
discipline in the operation of the school" and without colliding with the rights of
others. But conduct by the student, in class or out of it, which for any reason -whether it stems from time, place, or type of behavior -- materially disrupts
classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is,
of course, not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.

Robson

326

The First Amendment

Under our Constitution, free speech is not a right that is given only to be so
circumscribed that it exists in principle, but not in fact. Freedom of expression
would not truly exist if the right could be exercised only in an area that a
benevolent government has provided as a safe haven for crackpots. The
Constitution says that Congress (and the States) may not abridge the right to
free speech. This provision means what it says. We properly read it to permit
reasonable regulation of speech-connected activities in carefully restricted
circumstances. But we do not confine the permissible exercise of First
Amendment rights to a telephone booth or the four corners of a pamphlet, or to
supervised and ordained discussion in a school classroom.
If a regulation were adopted by school officials forbidding discussion of the
Vietnam conflict, or the expression by any student of opposition to it anywhere
on school property except as part of a prescribed classroom exercise, it would
be obvious that the regulation would violate the constitutional rights of
students, at least if it could not be justified by a showing that the students'
activities would materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of
the school. In the circumstances of the present case, the prohibition of the
silent, passive "witness of the armbands," as one of the children called it, is no
less offensive to the Constitution's guarantees.
As we have discussed, the record does not demonstrate any facts which might
reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or
material interference with school activities, and no disturbances or disorders on
the school premises in fact occurred. These petitioners merely went about their
ordained rounds in school. Their deviation consisted only in wearing on their
sleeve a band of black cloth, not more than two inches wide. They wore it to
exhibit their disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce,
to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt
them. They neither interrupted school activities nor sought to intrude in the
school affairs or the lives of others. They caused discussion outside of the
classrooms, but no interference with work and no disorder. In the
circumstances, our Constitution does not permit officials of the State to deny
their form of expression.
We express no opinion as to the form of relief which should be granted, this
being a matter for the lower courts to determine. We reverse and remand for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.
Although I agree with much of what is said in the Court's opinion, and with its
judgment in this case, I cannot share the Court's uncritical assumption that,
school discipline aside, the First Amendment rights of children are coextensive
with those of adults. Indeed, I had thought the Court decided otherwise just
last Term in Ginsberg v. New York. I continue to hold the view I expressed in
that case:
"[A] State may permissibly determine that, at least in some precisely delineated
areas, a child -- like someone in a captive audience -- is not possessed of that

The First Amendment

full capacity for individual choice which is the presupposition of First
Amendment guarantees."

Id; Cf. Prince v. Massachusetts.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring [omitted].
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.
The Court's holding in this case ushers in what I deem to be an entirely new era
in which the power to control pupils by the elected "officials of state supported
public schools . . ." in the United States is in ultimate effect transferred to the
Supreme Court. The Court brought this particular case here on a petition for
certiorari urging that the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect the right of
school pupils to express their political views all the way "from kindergarten
through high school." Here, the constitutional right to "political expression"
asserted was a right to wear black armbands during school hours and at
classes in order to demonstrate to the other students that the petitioners were
mourning because of the death of United States soldiers in Vietnam and to
protest that war which they were against. Ordered to refrain from wearing the
armbands in school by the elected school officials and the teachers vested with
state authority to do so, apparently only seven out of the school system's
18,000 pupils deliberately refused to obey the order. One defying pupil was Paul
Tinker, 8 years old, who was in the second grade; another, Hope Tinker, was 11
years old and in the fifth grade; a third member of the Tinker family was 13, in
the eighth grade; and a fourth member of the same family was John Tinker, 15
years old, an 11th grade high school pupil. Their father, a Methodist minister
without a church, is paid a salary by the American Friends Service Committee.
Another student who defied the school order and insisted on wearing an
armband in school was Christopher Eckhardt, an 11th grade pupil and a
petitioner in this case. His mother is an official in the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom.
As I read the Court's opinion, it relies upon the following grounds for holding
unconstitutional the judgment of the Des Moines school officials and the two
courts below. First, the Court concludes that the wearing of armbands is
"symbolic speech," which is "akin to pure speech,'" and therefore protected by
the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Secondly, the Court decides that the
public schools are an appropriate place to exercise "symbolic speech" as long as
normal school functions are not "unreasonably" disrupted. Finally, the Court
arrogates to itself, rather than to the State's elected officials charged with
running the schools, the decision as to which school disciplinary regulations
are "reasonable."
Assuming that the Court is correct in holding that the conduct of wearing
armbands for the purpose of conveying political ideas is protected by the First
Amendment,
the crucial remaining questions are whether students and
teachers may use the schools at their whim as a platform for the exercise of free
speech -- "symbolic" or "pure" -- and whether the courts will allocate to
themselves the function of deciding how the pupils' school day will be spent.
While I have always believed that, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments,
neither the State nor the Federal Government has any authority to regulate or
censor the content of speech, I have never believed that any person has a right

Robson

328

The First Amendment

to give speeches or engage in demonstrations where he pleases and when he
pleases. *** While the record does not show that any of these armband
students shouted, used profane language, or were violent in any manner,
detailed testimony by some of them shows their armbands caused comments,
warnings by other students, the poking of fun at them, and a warning by an
older football player that other nonprotesting students had better let them alone.
There is also evidence that a teacher of mathematics had his lesson period
practically "wrecked," chiefly by disputes with Mary Beth Tinker, who wore her
armband for her "demonstration."
Even a casual reading of the record shows that this armband did divert
students' minds from their regular lessons, and that talk, comments, etc., made
John Tinker "self-conscious" in attending school with his armband. While the
absence of obscene remarks or boisterous and loud disorder perhaps justifies
the Court's statement that the few armband students did not actually "disrupt"
the classwork, I think the record overwhelmingly shows that the armbands did
exactly what the elected school officials and principals foresaw they would, that
is, took the students' minds off their classwork and diverted them to thoughts
about the highly emotional subject of the Vietnam war. And I repeat that, if the
time has come when pupils of state-supported schools, kindergartens, grammar
schools, or high schools, can defy and flout orders of school officials to keep
their minds on their own schoolwork, it is the beginning of a new revolutionary
era of permissiveness in this country fostered by the judiciary. The next logical
step, it appears to me, would be to hold unconstitutional laws that bar pupils
under 21 or 18 from voting, or from being elected members of the boards of
education.
*** I deny, therefore, that it has been the "unmistakable holding of this Court
for almost 50 years" that "students" and "teachers" take with them into the
"schoolhouse gate" constitutional rights to "freedom of speech or expression."
In my view, teachers in state-controlled public schools are hired to teach there.
Although Mr. Justice McReynolds may have intimated to the contrary in Meyer
v. Nebraska, supra, certainly a teacher is not paid to go into school and teach
subjects the State does not hire him to teach as a part of its selected
curriculum. Nor are public school students sent to the schools at public
expense to broadcast political or any other views to educate and inform the
public. The original idea of schools, which I do not believe is yet abandoned as
worthless or out of date, was that children had not yet reached the point of
experience and wisdom which enabled them to teach all of their elders. It may
be that the Nation has outworn the old-fashioned slogan that "children are to be
seen, not heard," but one may, I hope, be permitted to harbor the thought that
taxpayers send children to school on the premise that, at their age, they need to
learn, not teach.***
Change has been said to be truly the law of life, but sometimes the old and the
tried and true are worth holding. The schools of this Nation have undoubtedly
contributed to giving us tranquility and to making us a more law-abiding people.
Uncontrolled and uncontrollable liberty is an enemy to domestic peace. We
cannot close our eyes to the fact that some of the country's greatest problems
are crimes committed by the youth, too many of school age. School discipline,
like parental discipline, is an integral and important part of training our

Robson

329

The First Amendment

children to be good citizens -- to be better citizens. Here a very small number of
students have crisply and summarily refused to obey a school order designed to
give pupils who want to learn the opportunity to do so. One does not need to be
a prophet or the son of a prophet to know that, after the Court's holding today,
some students in Iowa schools -- and, indeed, in all schools -- will be ready,
able, and willing to defy their teachers on practically all orders. This is the more
unfortunate for the schools since groups of students all over the land are
already running loose, conducting break-ins, sit-ins, lie-ins, and smash-ins.
Many of these student groups, as is all too familiar to all who read the
newspapers and watch the television news programs, have already engaged in
rioting, property seizures, and destruction. They have picketed schools to force
students not to cross their picket lines, and have too often violently attacked
earnest but frightened students who wanted an education that the pickets did
not want them to get. Students engaged in such activities are apparently
confident that they know far more about how to operate public school systems
than do their parents, teachers, and elected school officials. It is no answer to
say that the particular students here have not yet reached such high points in
their demands to attend classes in order to exercise their political pressures.
Turned loose with lawsuits for damages and injunctions against their teachers
as they are here, it is nothing but wishful thinking to imagine that young,
immature students will not soon believe it is their right to control the schools,
rather than the right of the States that collect the taxes to hire the teachers for
the benefit of the pupils. This case, therefore, wholly without constitutional
reasons, in my judgment, subjects all the public schools in the country to the
whims and caprices of their loudest-mouthed, but maybe not their brightest,
students. I, for one, am not fully persuaded that school pupils are wise enough,
even with this Court's expert help from Washington, to run the 23,390 public
school systems in our 50 States. I wish, therefore, wholly to disclaim any
purpose on my part to hold that the Federal Constitution compels the teachers,
parents, and elected school officials to surrender control of the American public
school system to public school students. I dissent.

The First Amendment

On April 26, 1983, respondent Matthew N. Fraser, a student at Bethel High
School in Pierce County, Washington, delivered a speech nominating a fellow
student for student elective office. Approximately 600 high school students,
many of whom were 14-year-olds, attended the assembly. Students were
required to attend the assembly or to report to the study hall. The assembly
was part of a school-sponsored educational program in self-government.
Students who elected not to attend the assembly were required to report to
study hall. During the entire speech, Fraser referred to his candidate in terms
of an elaborate, graphic, and explicit sexual metaphor.
Two of Fraser's teachers, with whom he discussed the contents of his speech in
advance, informed him that the speech was "inappropriate and that he probably
should not deliver it," and that his delivery of the speech might have "severe
consequences."
During Fraser's delivery of the speech, a school counselor observed the reaction
of students to the speech. Some students hooted and yelled; some by gestures
graphically simulated the sexual activities pointedly alluded to in respondent's
speech. Other students appeared to be bewildered and embarrassed by the
speech. One teacher reported that, on the day following the speech, she found it
necessary to forgo a portion of the scheduled class lesson in order to discuss
the speech with the class. A Bethel High School disciplinary rule prohibiting
the use of obscene language in the school provides:
Conduct which materially and substantially interferes with the
educational process is prohibited, including the use of obscene, profane
language or gestures.
The morning after the assembly, the Assistant Principal called Fraser into her
office and notified him that the school considered his speech to have been a
violation of this rule. Fraser was presented with copies of five letters submitted
by teachers, describing his conduct at the assembly; he was given a chance to
explain his conduct and he admitted to having given the speech described and
that he deliberately used sexual innuendo in the speech. Fraser was then
informed that he would be suspended for three days, and that his name would
be removed from the list of candidates for graduation speaker at the school's
commencement exercises.
Fraser sought review of this disciplinary action through the School District's
grievance procedures. The hearing officer determined that the speech given by
respondent was "indecent, lewd, and offensive to the modesty and decency of
many of the students and faculty in attendance at the assembly." The examiner
determined that the speech fell within the ordinary meaning of "obscene," as
used in the disruptive conduct rule, and affirmed the discipline in its entirety.
Fraser served two days of his suspension, and was allowed to return to school
on the third day.
B
Respondent, by his father as guardian ad litem, then brought this action in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. Respondent
alleged a violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech, and
sought both injunctive relief and monetary damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

Robson

331

The First Amendment

The District Court held that the school's sanctions violated respondent's right to
freedom of speech under the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution, that the school's disruptive conduct rule is unconstitutionally
vague and overbroad, and that the removal of respondent's name from the
graduation speaker's list violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment because the disciplinary rule makes no mention of such removal as
a possible sanction. The District Court awarded respondent $278 in damages,
$12,750 in litigation costs and attorney's fees, and enjoined the School District
from preventing respondent from speaking at the commencement ceremonies.
Respondent, who had been elected graduation speaker by a write-in vote of his
classmates, delivered a speech at the commencement ceremonies on June 8,
1983.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District
Court, holding that respondent's speech was indistinguishable from the protest
armband in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist. (1969). ***
We granted certiorari. We reverse.
II
This Court acknowledged in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community
School Dist. that students do not "shed their constitutional rights to freedom of
speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate." The Court of Appeals read that
case as precluding any discipline of Fraser for indecent speech and lewd
conduct in the school assembly. That court appears to have proceeded on the
theory that the use of lewd and obscene speech in order to make what the
speaker considered to be a point in a nominating speech for a fellow student
was essentially the same as the wearing of an armband in Tinker as a form of
protest or the expression of a political position.
The marked distinction between the political "message" of the armbands in
Tinker and the sexual content of respondent's speech in this case seems to have
been given little weight by the Court of Appeals. In upholding the students' right
to engage in a nondisruptive, passive expression of a political viewpoint in
Tinker, this Court was careful to note that the case did "not concern speech or
action that intrudes upon the work of the schools or the rights of other
students."
It is against this background that we turn to consider the level of First
Amendment protection accorded to Fraser's utterances and actions before an
official high school assembly attended by 600 students.
III
The role and purpose of the American public school system were well described
by two historians, who stated:
[P]ublic education must prepare pupils for citizenship in the Republic. . . . It
must inculcate the habits and manners of civility as values in themselves
conducive to happiness and as indispensable to the practice of self-government
in the community and the nation.
C. BEARD & M. BEARD, NEW BASIC HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES 228 (1968). ***

Robson

332

The First Amendment

These fundamental values of "habits and manners of civility" essential to a
democratic society must, of course, include tolerance of divergent political and
religious views, even when the views expressed may be unpopular. But these
"fundamental values" must also take into account consideration of the
sensibilities of others, and, in the case of a school, the sensibilities of fellow
students. The undoubted freedom to advocate unpopular and controversial
views in schools and classrooms must be balanced against the society's
countervailing interest in teaching students the boundaries of socially
appropriate behavior. Even the most heated political discourse in a democratic
society requires consideration for the personal sensibilities of the other
participants and audiences. ***
The First Amendment guarantees wide freedom in matters of adult public
discourse. A sharply divided Court upheld the right to express an antidraft
viewpoint in a public place, albeit in terms highly offensive to most citizens. See
Cohen v. California (1971) [Chapter 2]. It does not follow, however, that, simply
because the use of an offensive form of expression may not be prohibited to
adults making what the speaker considers a political point, the same latitude
must be permitted to children in a public school. *** The determination of what
manner of speech in the classroom or in school assembly is inappropriate
properly rests with the school board.
The process of educating our youth for citizenship in public schools is not
confined to books, the curriculum, and the civics class; schools must teach by
example the shared values of a civilized social order. Consciously or otherwise,
teachers -- and indeed the older students -- demonstrate the appropriate form
of civil discourse and political expression by their conduct and deportment in
and out of class. Inescapably, like parents, they are role models. The schools,
as instruments of the state, may determine that the essential lessons of civil,
mature conduct cannot be conveyed in a school that tolerates lewd, indecent, or
offensive speech and conduct such as that indulged in by this confused boy.
The pervasive sexual innuendo in Fraser's speech was plainly offensive to both
teachers and students -- indeed, to any mature person. By glorifying male
sexuality, and in its verbal content, the speech was acutely insulting to teenage
girl students. The speech could well be seriously damaging to its less mature
audience, many of whom were only 14 years old and on the threshold of
awareness of human sexuality. Some students were reported as bewildered by
the speech and the reaction of mimicry it provoked.
This Court's First Amendment jurisprudence has acknowledged limitations on
the otherwise absolute interest of the speaker in reaching an unlimited
audience where the speech is sexually explicit and the audience may include
children. ***
We have also recognized an interest in protecting minors from exposure to
vulgar and offensive spoken language. ***
We hold that petitioner School District acted entirely within its permissible
authority in imposing sanctions upon Fraser in response to his offensively lewd
and indecent speech. Unlike the sanctions imposed on the students wearing
armbands in Tinker, the penalties imposed in this case were unrelated to any
political viewpoint. The First Amendment does not prevent the school officials

Robson

333

The First Amendment

from determining that to permit a vulgar and lewd speech such as respondent's
would undermine the school's basic educational mission. A high school
assembly or classroom is no place for a sexually explicit monologue directed
towards an unsuspecting audience of teenage students. Accordingly, it was
perfectly appropriate for the school to disassociate itself to make the point to
the pupils that vulgar speech and lewd conduct is wholly inconsistent with the
"fundamental values" of public school education. ***
IV
Respondent contends that the circumstances of his suspension violated due
process because he had no way of knowing that the delivery of the speech in
question would subject him to disciplinary sanctions. This argument is wholly
without merit. ***
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is
Reversed.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN CONCURS IN THE RESULT [WITHOUT OPINION].
JUSTICE BRENNAN, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
Respondent gave the following speech at a high school assembly in support of a
candidate for student government office:
I know a man who is firm -- he's firm in his pants, he's firm in his shirt,
his character is firm -- but most . . . of all, his belief in you, the students
of Bethel, is firm.
Jeff Kuhlman is a man who takes his point and pounds it in. If necessary,
he'll take an issue and nail it to the wall. He doesn't attack things in
spurts -- he drives hard, pushing and pushing until finally -- he
succeeds.
Jeff is a man who will go to the very end -- even the climax, for each and
every one of you.
So vote for Jeff for A.S.B. vice-president -- he'll never come between you
and the best our high school can be.
The Court, referring to these remarks as "obscene," "vulgar," "lewd," and
"offensively lewd," concludes that school officials properly punished respondent
for uttering the speech. Having read the full text of respondent's remarks, I find
it difficult to believe that it is the same speech the Court describes. To my mind,
the most that can be said about respondent's speech -- and all that need be
said -- is that, in light of the discretion school officials have to teach high school
students how to conduct civil and effective public discourse, and to prevent
disruption of school educational activities, it was not unconstitutional for
school officials to conclude, under the circumstances of this case, that
respondent's remarks exceeded permissible limits. Thus, while I concur in the
Court's judgment, I write separately to express my understanding of the
breadth of the Court's holding.

Robson

334

The First Amendment

The Court today reaffirms the unimpeachable proposition that students do not
"‘shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the
schoolhouse gate.'" If respondent had given the same speech outside of the
school environment, he could not have been penalized simply because
government officials considered his language to be inappropriate. Moreover,
despite the Court's characterizations, the language respondent used is far
removed from the very narrow class of "obscene" speech which the Court has
held is not protected by the First Amendment. It is true, however, that the
State has interests in teaching high school students how to conduct civil and
effective public discourse and in avoiding disruption of educational school
activities. Thus, the Court holds that, under certain circumstances, high school
students may properly be reprimanded for giving a speech at a high school
assembly which school officials conclude disrupted the school's educational
mission. Respondent's speech may well have been protected had he given it in
school but under different circumstances, where the school's legitimate
interests in teaching and maintaining civil public discourse were less weighty.
In the present case, school officials sought only to ensure that a high school
assembly proceed in an orderly manner. There is no suggestion that school
officials attempted to regulate respondent's speech because they disagreed with
the views he sought to express. Nor does this case involve an attempt by school
officials to ban written materials they consider "inappropriate" for high school
students, cf. Board of Education v. Pico (1982), or to limit what students should
hear, read, or learn about. Thus, the Court's holding concerns only the
authority that school officials have to restrict a high school student's use of
disruptive language in a speech given to a high school assembly.
The authority school officials have to regulate such speech by high school
students is not limitless. Under the circumstances of this case, however, I
believe that school officials did not violate the First Amendment in determining
that respondent should be disciplined for the disruptive language he used while
addressing a high school assembly. Thus, I concur in the judgment reversing
the decision of the Court of Appeals.
JUSTICE MARSHALL, DISSENTING.
I agree with the principles that Justice Brennan sets out in his opinion
concurring in the judgment. I dissent from the Court's decision, however,
because, in my view, the School District failed to demonstrate that respondent's
remarks were indeed disruptive. The District Court and Court of Appeals
conscientiously applied Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.
(1969), and concluded that the School District had not demonstrated any
disruption of the educational process. I recognize that the school administration
must be given wide latitude to determine what forms of conduct are
inconsistent with the school's educational mission; nevertheless, where speech
is involved, we may not unquestioningly accept a teacher's or administrator's
assertion that certain pure speech interfered with education. Here the School
District, despite a clear opportunity to do so, failed to bring in evidence
sufficient to convince either of the two lower courts that education at Bethel

Robson

335

The First Amendment

School was disrupted by respondent's speech. I therefore see no reason to
disturb the Court of Appeals' judgment.
JUSTICE STEVENS, DISSENTING.
"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."
When I was a high school student, the use of those words in a public forum
shocked the Nation. Today Clark Gable's four-letter expletive is less offensive
than it was then. Nevertheless, I assume that high school administrators may
prohibit the use of that word in classroom discussion and even in
extracurricular activities that are sponsored by the school and held on school
premises. For I believe a school faculty must regulate the content as well as the
style of student speech in carrying out its educational mission. It does seem to
me, however, that, if a student is to be punished for using offensive speech, he
is entitled to fair notice of the scope of the prohibition and the consequences of
its violation. The interest in free speech protected by the First Amendment and
the interest in fair procedure protected by the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment combine to require this conclusion.
*** I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

WHITE, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH REHNQUIST, C. J., AND STEVENS,
O'CONNOR, AND SCALIA, JJ., JOINED. BRENNAN, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH
MARSHALL AND BLACKMUN, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE WHITE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
This case concerns the extent to which educators may exercise editorial control
over the contents of a high school newspaper produced as part of the school's
journalism curriculum.
I
Petitioners are the Hazelwood School District in St. Louis County, Missouri;
various school officials; Robert Eugene Reynolds, the principal of Hazelwood
East High School; and Howard Emerson, a teacher in the school district.
Respondents are three former Hazelwood East students who were staff
members of Spectrum, the school newspaper. They contend that school officials
violated their First Amendment rights by deleting two pages of articles from the
May 13, 1983, issue of Spectrum.
Spectrum was written and edited by the Journalism II class at Hazelwood East.
The newspaper was published every three weeks or so during the 1982-1983
school year. More than 4,500 copies of the newspaper were distributed during
that year to students, school personnel, and members of the community.
The Board of Education allocated funds from its annual budget for the printing
of Spectrum. These funds were supplemented by proceeds from sales of the

Robson

336

The First Amendment

newspaper. The printing expenses during the 1982-1983 school year totaled
$4,668.50; revenue from sales was $1,166.84. The other costs associated with
the newspaper - such as supplies, textbooks, and a portion of the journalism
teacher's salary - were borne entirely by the Board.
The Journalism II course was taught by Robert Stergos for most of the 19821983 academic year. Stergos left Hazelwood East to take a job in private
industry on April 29, 1983, when the May 13 edition of Spectrum was nearing
completion, and petitioner Emerson took his place as newspaper adviser for the
remaining weeks of the term.
The practice at Hazelwood East during the spring 1983 semester was for the
journalism teacher to submit page proofs of each Spectrum issue to Principal
Reynolds for his review prior to publication. On May 10, Emerson delivered the
proofs of the May 13 edition to Reynolds, who objected to two of the articles
scheduled to appear in that edition. One of the stories described three
Hazelwood East students' experiences with pregnancy; the other discussed the
impact of divorce on students at the school.
Reynolds was concerned that, although the pregnancy story used false names
"to keep the identity of these girls a secret," the pregnant students still might be
identifiable from the text. He also believed that the article's references to sexual
activity and birth control were inappropriate for some of the younger students
at the school. In addition, Reynolds was concerned that a student identified by
name in the divorce story had complained that her father "wasn't spending
enough time with my mom, my sister and I" prior to the divorce, "was always
out of town on business or out late playing cards with the guys," and "always
argued about everything" with her mother. Reynolds believed that the student's
parents should have been given an opportunity to respond to these remarks or
to consent to their publication. He was unaware that Emerson had deleted the
student's name from the final version of the article.
Reynolds believed that there was no time to make the necessary changes in the
stories before the scheduled press run and that the newspaper would not
appear before the end of the school year if printing were delayed to any
significant extent. He concluded that his only options under the circumstances
were to publish a four-page newspaper instead of the planned six-page
newspaper, eliminating the two pages on which the offending stories appeared,
or to publish no newspaper at all. Accordingly, he directed Emerson to withhold
from publication the two pages containing the stories on pregnancy and divorce.
He informed his superiors of the decision, and they concurred.
Respondents subsequently commenced this action in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Missouri seeking a declaration that their First
Amendment rights had been violated, injunctive relief, and monetary damages.
After a bench trial, the District Court denied an injunction, holding that no
First Amendment violation had occurred. *** The Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit reversed. ***
We granted certiorari and we now reverse.
II

Robson

337

The First Amendment

Students in the public schools do not "shed their constitutional rights to
freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate." Tinker. They cannot
be punished merely for expressing their personal views on the school premises whether "in the cafeteria, or on the playing field, or on the campus during the
authorized hours," - unless school authorities have reason to believe that such
expression will "substantially interfere with the work of the school or impinge
upon the rights of other students."
We have nonetheless recognized that the First Amendment rights of students in
the public schools "are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in
other settings," Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, and must be "applied in
light of the special characteristics of the school environment." Tinker. A school
need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its "basic educational
mission," Fraser, even though the government could not censor similar speech
outside the school. *** It is in this context that respondents' First Amendment
claims must be considered.
A
We deal first with the question whether Spectrum may appropriately be
characterized as a forum for public expression. The public schools do not
possess all of the attributes of streets, parks, and other traditional public
forums that "time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly,
communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions."
Hague v. CIO (1939). Hence, school facilities may be deemed to be public forums
only if school authorities have "by policy or by practice" opened those facilities
"for indiscriminate use by the general public," Perry Education Assn. v. Perry
Local Educators' Assn. (1983), or by some segment of the public, such as
student organizations. Id. *** School officials did not evince either "by policy or
by practice" any intent to open the pages of Spectrum to "indiscriminate use,"
by its student reporters and editors, or by the student body generally. Instead,
they "reserve[d] the forum for its intended purpos[e]," as a supervised learning
experience for journalism students. Accordingly, school officials were entitled to
regulate the contents of Spectrum in any reasonable manner. It is this standard,
rather than our decision in Tinker, that governs this case.
B
The question whether the First Amendment requires a school to tolerate
particular student speech - the question that we addressed in Tinker - is
different from the question whether the First Amendment requires a school
affirmatively to promote particular student speech. The former question
addresses educators' ability to silence a student's personal expression that
happens to occur on the school premises. The latter question concerns
educators' authority over school-sponsored publications, theatrical productions,
and other expressive activities that students, parents, and members of the
public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school. These
activities may fairly be characterized as part of the school curriculum, whether
or not they occur in a traditional classroom setting, so long as they are
supervised by faculty members and designed to impart particular knowledge or
skills to student participants and audiences.

Robson

338

The First Amendment

Educators are entitled to exercise greater control over this second form of
student expression to assure that participants learn whatever lessons the
activity is designed to teach, that readers or listeners are not exposed to
material that may be inappropriate for their level of maturity, and that the
views of the individual speaker are not erroneously attributed to the school. ***
A school must be able to set high standards for the student speech that is
disseminated under its auspices - standards that may be higher than those
demanded by some newspaper publishers or theatrical producers in the "real"
world - and may refuse to disseminate student speech that does not meet those
standards. In addition, a school must be able to take into account the
emotional maturity of the intended audience in determining whether to
disseminate student speech on potentially sensitive topics, which might range
from the existence of Santa Claus in an elementary school setting to the
particulars of teenage sexual activity in a high school setting. A school must
also retain the authority to refuse to sponsor student speech that might
reasonably be perceived to advocate drug or alcohol use, irresponsible sex, or
conduct otherwise inconsistent with "the shared values of a civilized social
order," Fraser, or to associate the school with any position other than neutrality
on matters of political controversy. Otherwise, the schools would be unduly
constrained from fulfilling their role as "a principal instrument in awakening
the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and
in helping him to adjust normally to his environment." Brown v. Board of
Education (1954).
Accordingly, we conclude that the standard articulated in Tinker for
determining when a school may punish student expression need not also be the
standard for determining when a school may refuse to lend its name and
resources to the dissemination of student expression. Instead, we hold that
educators do not offend the First Amendment by exercising editorial control
over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive
activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate
pedagogical concerns.
This standard is consistent with our oft-expressed view that the education of
the Nation's youth is primarily the responsibility of parents, teachers, and state
and local school officials, and not of federal judges. It is only when the decision
to censor a school-sponsored publication, theatrical production, or other vehicle
of student expression has no valid educational purpose that the First
Amendment is so "directly and sharply implicate as to require judicial
intervention to protect students' constitutional rights.
III
We also conclude that Principal Reynolds acted reasonably in requiring the
deletion from the May 13 issue of Spectrum of the pregnancy article, the divorce
article, and the remaining articles that were to appear on the same pages of the
newspaper.
The initial paragraph of the pregnancy article declared that "[a]ll names have
been changed to keep the identity of these girls a secret." The principal
concluded that the students' anonymity was not adequately protected, however,
given the other identifying information in the article and the small number of

Robson

339

The First Amendment

pregnant students at the school. Indeed, a teacher at the school credibly
testified that she could positively identify at least one of the girls and possibly
all three. It is likely that many students at Hazelwood East would have been at
least as successful in identifying the girls. Reynolds therefore could reasonably
have feared that the article violated whatever pledge of anonymity had been
given to the pregnant students. In addition, he could reasonably have been
concerned that the article was not sufficiently sensitive to the privacy interests
of the students' boyfriends and parents, who were discussed in the article but
who were given no opportunity to consent to its publication or to offer a
response. The article did not contain graphic accounts of sexual activity. The
girls did comment in the article, however, concerning their sexual histories and
their use or nonuse of birth control. It was not unreasonable for the principal to
have concluded that such frank talk was inappropriate in a school-sponsored
publication distributed to 14-year-old freshmen and presumably taken home to
be read by students' even younger brothers and sisters.
The student who was quoted by name in the version of the divorce article seen
by Principal Reynolds made comments sharply critical of her father. The
principal could reasonably have concluded that an individual publicly identified
as an inattentive parent - indeed, as one who chose "playing cards with the
guys" over home and family - was entitled to an opportunity to defend himself
as a matter of journalistic fairness. These concerns were shared by both of
Spectrum's faculty advisers for the 1982-1983 school year, who testified that
they would not have allowed the article to be printed without deletion of the
student's name.
Principal Reynolds testified credibly at trial that, at the time that he reviewed
the proofs of the May 13 issue during an extended telephone conversation with
Emerson, he believed that there was no time to make any changes in the
articles, and that the newspaper had to be printed immediately or not at all. It
is true that Reynolds did not verify whether the necessary modifications could
still have been made in the articles, and that Emerson did not volunteer the
information that printing could be delayed until the changes were made. We
nonetheless agree with the District Court that the decision to excise the two
pages containing the problematic articles was reasonable given the particular
circumstances of this case. These circumstances included the very recent
replacement of Stergos by Emerson, who may not have been entirely familiar
with Spectrum editorial and production procedures, and the pressure felt by
Reynolds to make an immediate decision so that students would not be
deprived of the newspaper altogether.
In sum, we cannot reject as unreasonable Principal Reynolds' conclusion that
neither the pregnancy article nor the divorce article was suitable for publication
in Spectrum. Reynolds could reasonably have concluded that the students who
had written and edited these articles had not sufficiently mastered those
portions of the Journalism II curriculum that pertained to the treatment of
controversial issues and personal attacks, the need to protect the privacy of
individuals whose most intimate concerns are to be revealed in the newspaper,
and "the legal, moral, and ethical restrictions imposed upon journalists within
[a] school community" that includes adolescent subjects and readers. Finally,
we conclude that the principal's decision to delete two pages of Spectrum,

Robson

340

The First Amendment

rather than to delete only the offending articles or to require that they be
modified, was reasonable under the circumstances as he understood them.
Accordingly, no violation of First Amendment rights occurred.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is therefore
Reversed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE MARSHALL AND JUSTICE BLACKMUN JOIN,
DISSENTING.
When the young men and women of Hazelwood East High School registered for
Journalism II, they expected a civics lesson. Spectrum, the newspaper they
were to publish, "was not just a class exercise in which students learned to
prepare papers and hone writing skills, it was a . . . forum established to give
students an opportunity to express their views while gaining an appreciation of
their rights and responsibilities under the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution . . . ." "[A]t the beginning of each school year," the student
journalists published a Statement of Policy - tacitly approved each year by
school authorities - announcing their expectation that "Spectrum, as a studentpress publication, accepts all rights implied by the First Amendment . . . . Only
speech that `materially and substantially interferes with the requirements of
appropriate discipline' can be found unacceptable and therefore prohibited."
The school board itself affirmatively guaranteed the students of Journalism II
an atmosphere conducive to fostering such an appreciation and exercising the
full panoply of rights associated with a free student press. "School sponsored
student publications," it vowed, "will not restrict free expression or diverse
viewpoints within the rules of responsible journalism."
This case arose when the Hazelwood East administration breached its own
promise, dashing its students' expectations. The school principal, without prior
consultation or explanation, excised six articles - comprising two full pages - of
the May 13, 1983, issue of Spectrum. He did so not because any of the articles
would "materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of
appropriate discipline," but simply because he considered two of the six
"inappropriate, personal, sensitive, and unsuitable" for student consumption.
In my view the principal broke more than just a promise. He violated the First
Amendment's prohibitions against censorship of any student expression that
neither disrupts classwork nor invades the rights of others, and against any
censorship that is not narrowly tailored to serve its purpose.
I
*** [The Court has never suggested] the distinction, which the Court today finds
dispositive, between school-sponsored and incidental student expression.
II
Even if we were writing on a clean slate, I would reject the Court's rationale for
abandoning Tinker in this case. The Court offers no more than an obscure
tangle of three excuses to afford educators "greater control" over schoolsponsored speech than the Tinker test would permit: the public educator's
prerogative to control curriculum; the pedagogical interest in shielding the high
school audience from objectionable viewpoints and sensitive topics; and the

Robson

341

The First Amendment

school's need to dissociate itself from student expression. None of the excuses,
once disentangled, supports the distinction that the Court draws. Tinker fully
addresses the first concern; the second is illegitimate; and the third is readily
achievable through less oppressive means.***
III
Since the censorship served no legitimate pedagogical purpose, it cannot by any
stretch of the imagination have been designed to prevent "materia[l] disrup[tion
of] classwork," Tinker. Nor did the censorship fall within the category that
Tinker described as necessary to prevent student expression from "inva[ding]
the rights of others," ibid. If that term is to have any content, it must be limited
to rights that are protected by law. "Any yardstick less exacting than [that]
could result in school officials curtailing speech at the slightest fear of
disturbance," a prospect that would be completely at odds with this Court's
pronouncement that the "undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance
is not enough [even in the public school context] to overcome the right to
freedom of expression." Tinker. And, as the Court of Appeals correctly reasoned,
whatever journalistic impropriety these articles may have contained, they could
not conceivably be tortious, much less criminal.
Finally, even if the majority were correct that the principal could
constitutionally have censored the objectionable material, I would emphatically
object to the brutal manner in which he did so. Where "[t]he separation of
legitimate from illegitimate speech calls for more sensitive tools," the principal
used a paper shredder. He objected to some material in two articles, but excised
six entire articles. He did not so much as inquire into obvious alternatives, such
as precise deletions or additions (one of which had already been made),
rearranging the layout, or delaying publication. Such unthinking contempt for
individual rights is intolerable from any state official. It is particularly insidious
from one to whom the public entrusts the task of inculcating in its youth an
appreciation for the cherished democratic liberties that our Constitution
guarantees.
IV
The Court opens its analysis in this case by purporting to reaffirm Tinker's
time-tested proposition that public school students "do not `shed their
constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse
gate.'" That is an ironic introduction to an opinion that denudes high school
students of much of the First Amendment protection that Tinker itself
prescribed. Instead of "teach[ing] children to respect the diversity of ideas that
is fundamental to the American system," and "that our Constitution is a living
reality, not parchment preserved under glass," the Court today "teach[es] youth
to discount important principles of our government as mere platitudes." West
Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette. The young men and women of
Hazelwood East expected a civics lesson, but not the one the Court teaches
them today.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
At a school-sanctioned and school-supervised event, a high school principal
saw some of her students unfurl a large banner conveying a message she
reasonably regarded as promoting illegal drug use. Consistent with established
school policy prohibiting such messages at school events, the principal directed
the students to take down the banner. One student--among those who had
brought the banner to the event--refused to do so. The principal confiscated the
banner and later suspended the student. The Ninth Circuit held that the
principal's actions violated the First Amendment, and that the student could
sue the principal for damages.
Our cases make clear that students do not "shed their constitutional rights to
freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate." Tinker. At the same
time, we have held that "the constitutional rights of students in public school
are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings,"
Fraser, and that the rights of students "must be 'applied in light of the special
characteristics of the school environment.' " Hazelwood School Dist. Consistent
with these principles, we hold that schools may take steps to safeguard those
entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as
encouraging illegal drug use. We conclude that the school officials in this case
did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and
suspending the student responsible for it.
I
On January 24, 2002, the Olympic Torch Relay passed through Juneau, Alaska,
on its way to the winter games in Salt Lake City, Utah. The torchbearers were to
proceed along a street in front of Juneau-Douglas High School (JDHS) while
school was in session. Petitioner Deborah Morse, the school principal, decided
to permit staff and students to participate in the Torch Relay as an approved
social event or class trip. Students were allowed to leave class to observe the
relay from either side of the street. Teachers and administrative officials
monitored the students' actions.
Respondent Joseph Frederick, a JDHS senior, was late to school that day.
When he arrived, he joined his friends (all but one of whom were JDHS
students) across the street from the school to watch the event. Not all the
students waited patiently. Some became rambunctious, throwing plastic cola
bottles and snowballs and scuffling with their classmates. As the torchbearers
and camera crews passed by, Frederick and his friends unfurled a 14-foot
banner bearing the phrase: "BONG HiTS 4 JESUS." The large banner was easily
readable by the students on the other side of the street.

Robson

343

The First Amendment

Principal Morse immediately crossed the street and demanded that the banner
be taken down. Everyone but Frederick complied. Morse confiscated the banner
and told Frederick to report to her office, where she suspended him for 10 days.
Morse later explained that she told Frederick to take the banner down because
she thought it encouraged illegal drug use, in violation of established school
policy. Juneau School Board Policy No. 5520 states: "The Board specifically
prohibits any assembly or public expression that ... advocates the use of
substances that are illegal to minors ... ." In addition, Juneau School Board
Policy No. 5850 subjects "[p]upils who participate in approved social events and
class trips" to the same student conduct rules that apply during the regular
school program.
Frederick administratively appealed his suspension, but the Juneau School
District Superintendent upheld it, limiting it to time served (8 days). In a
memorandum setting forth his reasons, the superintendent determined that
Frederick had displayed his banner "in the midst of his fellow students, during
school hours, at a school-sanctioned activity." He further explained that
Frederick "was not disciplined because the principal of the school 'disagreed'
with his message, but because his speech appeared to advocate the use of
illegal drugs.” The superintendent continued:
"The common-sense understanding of the phrase 'bong hits' is that it is a
reference to a means of smoking marijuana. Given [Frederick's] inability
or unwillingness to express any other credible meaning for the phrase, I
can only agree with the principal and countless others who saw the
banner as advocating the use of illegal drugs. [Frederick's] speech was
not political. He was not advocating the legalization of marijuana or
promoting a religious belief. He was displaying a fairly silly message
promoting illegal drug usage in the midst of a school activity, for the
benefit of television cameras covering the Torch Relay. [Frederick's]
speech was potentially disruptive to the event and clearly disruptive of
and inconsistent with the school's educational mission to educate
students about the dangers of illegal drugs and to discourage their use."
Relying on our decision in Fraser, the superintendent concluded that the
principal's actions were permissible because Frederick's banner was "speech or
action that intrudes upon the work of the schools." The Juneau School District
Board of Education upheld the suspension.
Frederick then filed suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that the school board
and Morse had violated his First Amendment rights. He sought declaratory and
injunctive relief, unspecified compensatory damages, punitive damages, and
attorney's fees. The District Court granted summary judgment for the school
board and Morse, ruling that they were entitled to qualified immunity and that
they had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights. ***
The Ninth Circuit reversed. Deciding that Frederick acted during a "schoolauthorized activit[y]," and "proceed[ing] on the basis that the banner expressed
a positive sentiment about marijuana use," the court nonetheless found a
violation of Frederick's First Amendment rights because the school punished
Frederick without demonstrating that his speech gave rise to a "risk of
substantial disruption." The court further concluded that Frederick's right to

Robson

344

The First Amendment

display his banner was so "clearly established" that a reasonable principal in
Morse's position would have understood that her actions were unconstitutional,
and that Morse was therefore not entitled to qualified immunity.
We granted certiorari on two questions: whether Frederick had a First
Amendment right to wield his banner, and, if so, whether that right was so
clearly established that the principal may be held liable for damages. We resolve
the first question against Frederick, and therefore have no occasion to reach the
second.
II
At the outset, we reject Frederick's argument that this is not a school speech
case--as has every other authority to address the question. The event occurred
during normal school hours. It was sanctioned by Principal Morse "as an
approved social event or class trip," and the school district's rules expressly
provide that pupils in "approved social events and class trips are subject to
district rules for student conduct." Teachers and administrators were
interspersed among the students and charged with supervising them. The high
school band and cheerleaders performed. Frederick, standing among other
JDHS students across the street from the school, directed his banner toward
the school, making it plainly visible to most students. Under these
circumstances, we agree with the superintendent that Frederick cannot "stand
in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-sanctioned
activity and claim he is not at school." There is some uncertainty at the outer
boundaries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents, but not
on these facts.
III
The message on Frederick's banner is cryptic. It is no doubt offensive to some,
perhaps amusing to others. To still others, it probably means nothing at all.
Frederick himself claimed "that the words were just nonsense meant to attract
television cameras." But Principal Morse thought the banner would be
interpreted by those viewing it as promoting illegal drug use, and that
interpretation is plainly a reasonable one.
As Morse later explained in a declaration, when she saw the sign, she thought
that "the reference to a 'bong hit' would be widely understood by high school
students and others as referring to smoking marijuana." She further believed
that "display of the banner would be construed by students, District personnel,
parents and others witnessing the display of the banner, as advocating or
promoting illegal drug use"--in violation of school policy.
We agree with Morse. At least two interpretations of the words on the banner
demonstrate that the sign advocated the use of illegal drugs. First, the phrase
could be interpreted as an imperative: "[Take] bong hits ..."--a message
equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to "smoke marijuana" or "use
an illegal drug." Alternatively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug
use--"bong hits [are a good thing]," or "[we take] bong hits"--and we discern no
meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of
fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion.

Robson

345

The First Amendment

The pro-drug interpretation of the banner gains further plausibility given the
paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear. The best Frederick can
come up with is that the banner is "meaningless and funny." The dissent
similarly refers to the sign's message as "curious," "ambiguous," "nonsense,"
"ridiculous," "obscure," "silly," "quixotic," and "stupid." Gibberish is surely a
possible interpretation of the words on the banner, but it is not the only one,
and dismissing the banner as meaningless ignores its undeniable reference to
illegal drugs.
The dissent mentions Frederick's "credible and uncontradicted explanation for
the message--he just wanted to get on television." But that is a description of
Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; it is not an interpretation of what
the banner says. The way Frederick was going to fulfill his ambition of
appearing on television was by unfurling a pro-drug banner at a school event,
in the presence of teachers and fellow students.
Elsewhere in its opinion, the dissent emphasizes the importance of political
speech and the need to foster "national debate about a serious issue," as if to
suggest that the banner is political speech. But not even Frederick argues that
the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message. Contrary to the
dissent's suggestion, this is plainly not a case about political debate over the
criminalization of drug use or possession.
IV
The question thus becomes whether a principal may, consistent with the First
Amendment, restrict student speech at a school event, when that speech is
reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use. We hold that she may.
In Tinker, this Court made clear that "First Amendment rights, applied in light
of the special characteristics of the school environment, are available to
teachers and students." *** The essential facts of Tinker are quite stark,
implicating concerns at the heart of the First Amendment. The students sought
to engage in political speech, using the armbands to express their "disapproval
of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views
known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them." Political
speech, of course, is "at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to
protect." Virginia v. Black (2003). The only interest the Court discerned
underlying the school's actions was the "mere desire to avoid the discomfort
and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint," or "an
urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression."
Tinker. That interest was not enough to justify banning "a silent, passive
expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance." Id.
This Court's next student speech case was Fraser.*** The mode of analysis
employed in Fraser is not entirely clear. The Court was plainly attuned to the
content of Fraser's speech, citing the "marked distinction between the political
'message' of the armbands in Tinker and the sexual content of [Fraser's]
speech." But the Court also reasoned that school boards have the authority to
determine "what manner of speech in the classroom or in school assembly is
inappropriate."

Robson

346

The First Amendment

We need not resolve this debate to decide this case. For present purposes, it is
enough to distill from Fraser two basic principles. First, Fraser's holding
demonstrates that "the constitutional rights of students in public school are not
automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings." Had
Fraser delivered the same speech in a public forum outside the school context,
it would have been protected. *** Second, Fraser established that the mode of
analysis set forth in Tinker is not absolute. Whatever approach Fraser employed,
it certainly did not conduct the "substantial disruption" analysis prescribed by
Tinker.
Our most recent student speech case, Kuhlmeier, concerned "expressive
activities that students, parents, and members of the public might reasonably
perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school." ***
Kuhlmeier does not control this case because no one would reasonably believe
that Frederick's banner bore the school's imprimatur. The case is nevertheless
instructive because it confirms both principles cited above. Kuhlmeier
acknowledged that schools may regulate some speech "even though the
government could not censor similar speech outside the school." And, like
Fraser, it confirms that the rule of Tinker is not the only basis for restricting
student speech.
*** Congress has declared that part of a school's job is educating students
about the dangers of illegal drug use. It has provided billions of dollars to
support state and local drug-prevention programs, and required that schools
receiving federal funds under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities
Act of 1994 certify that their drug prevention programs "convey a clear and
consistent message that ... the illegal use of drugs [is] wrong and harmful." 20
U. S. C. §7114(d)(6) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).
Thousands of school boards throughout the country--including JDHS--have
adopted policies aimed at effectuating this message. Those school boards know
that peer pressure is perhaps "the single most important factor leading
schoolchildren to take drugs," and that students are more likely to use drugs
when the norms in school appear to tolerate such behavior. Student speech
celebrating illegal drug use at a school event, in the presence of school
administrators and teachers, thus poses a particular challenge for school
officials working to protect those entrusted to their care from the dangers of
drug abuse.
The "special characteristics of the school environment," Tinker,
and the
governmental interest in stopping student drug abuse--reflected in the policies
of Congress and myriad school boards, including JDHS--allow schools to
restrict student expression that they reasonably regard as promoting illegal
drug use. Tinker warned that schools may not prohibit student speech because
of "undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance" or "a mere desire to
avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular
viewpoint." Id.. The danger here is far more serious and palpable. The particular
concern to prevent student drug abuse at issue here, embodied in established
school policy, extends well beyond an abstract desire to avoid controversy.
Petitioners urge us to adopt the broader rule that Frederick's speech is
proscribable because it is plainly "offensive" as that term is used in Fraser. We

Robson

347

The First Amendment

think this stretches Fraser too far; that case should not be read to encompass
any speech that could fit under some definition of "offensive." After all, much
political and religious speech might be perceived as offensive to some. The
concern here is not that Frederick's speech was offensive, but that it was
reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use.
Although accusing this decision of doing "serious violence to the First
Amendment" by authorizing "viewpoint discrimination," the dissent concludes
that "it might well be appropriate to tolerate some targeted viewpoint
discrimination in this unique setting," . Nor do we understand the dissent to
take the position that schools are required to tolerate student advocacy of illegal
drug use at school events, even if that advocacy falls short of inviting
"imminent" lawless action. And even the dissent recognizes that the issues here
are close enough that the principal should not be held liable in damages, but
should instead enjoy qualified immunity for her actions. Stripped of rhetorical
flourishes, then, the debate between the dissent and this opinion is less about
constitutional first principles than about whether Frederick's banner
constitutes promotion of illegal drug use. We have explained our view that it
does. The dissent's contrary view on that relatively narrow question hardly
justifies sounding the First Amendment bugle.
School principals have a difficult job, and a vitally important one. When
Frederick suddenly and unexpectedly unfurled his banner, Morse had to decide
to act--or not act--on the spot. It was reasonable for her to conclude that the
banner promoted illegal drug use--in violation of established school policy--and
that failing to act would send a powerful message to the students in her charge,
including Frederick, about how serious the school was about the dangers of
illegal drug use. The First Amendment does not require schools to tolerate at
school events student expression that contributes to those dangers.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE THOMAS, CONCURRING.
The Court today decides that a public school may prohibit speech advocating
illegal drug use. I agree and therefore join its opinion in full. I write separately
to state my view that the standard set forth in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent
Community School Dist. (1969), is without basis in the Constitution.
*** Today, the Court creates another exception. In doing so, we continue to
distance ourselves from Tinker, but we neither overrule it nor offer an
explanation of when it operates and when it does not. I am afraid that our
jurisprudence now says that students have a right to speak in schools except
when they don't--a standard continuously developed through litigation against
local schools and their administrators. In my view, petitioners could prevail for
a much simpler reason: As originally understood, the Constitution does not
afford students a right to free speech in public schools. ***
I join the Court's opinion because it erodes Tinker's hold in the realm of student
speech, even though it does so by adding to the patchwork of exceptions to the

Robson

348

The First Amendment

Tinker standard. I think the better approach is to dispense with Tinker
altogether, and given the opportunity, I would do so.
JUSTICE ALITO, WITH WHOM JUSTICE KENNEDY JOINS, CONCURRING.
I join the opinion of the Court on the understanding that (a) it goes no further
than to hold that a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer
would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and (b) it provides no support for
any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on
any political or social issue, including speech on issues such as "the wisdom of
the war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use." ***
JUSTICE STEVENS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE SOUTER AND JUSTICE GINSBURG JOIN,
DISSENTING.
A significant fact barely mentioned by the Court sheds a revelatory light on the
motives of both the students and the principal of Juneau-Douglas High School
(JDHS). On January 24, 2002, the Olympic Torch Relay gave those Alaska
residents a rare chance to appear on national television. As Joseph Frederick
repeatedly explained, he did not address the curious message--"BONG HiTS 4
JESUS"--to his fellow students. He just wanted to get the camera crews'
attention. Moreover, concern about a nationwide evaluation of the conduct of
the JDHS student body would have justified the principal's decision to remove
an attention-grabbing 14-foot banner, even if it had merely proclaimed "Glaciers
Melt!"
I agree with the Court that the principal should not be held liable for pulling
down Frederick's banner. I would hold, however, that the school's interest in
protecting its students from exposure to speech "reasonably regarded as
promoting illegal drug use," cannot justify disciplining Frederick for his
attempt to make an ambiguous statement to a television audience simply
because it contained an oblique reference to drugs. The First Amendment
demands more, indeed, much more.
The Court holds otherwise only after laboring to establish two uncontroversial
propositions: first, that the constitutional rights of students in school settings
are not coextensive with the rights of adults, and second, that deterring drug
use by schoolchildren is a valid and terribly important interest. As to the first, I
take the Court's point that the message on Frederick's banner is not necessarily
protected speech, even though it unquestionably would have been had the
banner been unfurled elsewhere. As to the second, I am willing to assume that
the Court is correct that the pressing need to deter drug use supports JDHS's
rule prohibiting willful conduct that expressly "advocates the use of substances
that are illegal to minors." But it is a gross non sequitur to draw from these two
unremarkable propositions the remarkable conclusion that the school may
suppress student speech that was never meant to persuade anyone to do
anything.
In my judgment, the First Amendment protects student speech if the message
itself neither violates a permissible rule nor expressly advocates conduct that is
illegal and harmful to students. This nonsense banner does neither, and the
Court does serious violence to the First Amendment in upholding--indeed,

Robson

349

The First Amendment

lauding--a school's decision to punish Frederick for expressing a view with
which it disagreed.
*** Even if advocacy could somehow be wedged into Frederick's obtuse
reference to marijuana, that advocacy was at best subtle and ambiguous. There
is abundant precedent, including another opinion The Chief Justice announces
today, for the proposition that when the "First Amendment is implicated, the tie
goes to the speaker," Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.
(2007) and that "when it comes to defining what speech qualifies as the
functional equivalent of express advocacy ... we give the benefit of the doubt to
speech, not censorship." If this were a close case, the tie would have to go to
Frederick's speech, not to the principal's strained reading of his quixotic
message.
Among other things, the Court's ham-handed, categorical approach is deaf to
the constitutional imperative to permit unfettered debate, even among highschool students, about the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legalizing
marijuana for medicinal use. See Tinker. If Frederick's stupid reference to
marijuana can in the Court's view justify censorship, then high school students
everywhere could be forgiven for zipping their mouths about drugs at school
lest some "reasonable" observer censor and then punish them for promoting
drugs.
Consider, too, that the school district's rule draws no distinction between
alcohol and marijuana, but applies evenhandedly to all "substances that are
illegal to minors." Given the tragic consequences of teenage alcohol
consumption--drinking causes far more fatal accidents than the misuse of
marijuana--the school district's interest in deterring teenage alcohol use is at
least comparable to its interest in preventing marijuana use. Under the Court's
reasoning, must the First Amendment give way whenever a school seeks to
punish a student for any speech mentioning beer, or indeed anything else that
might be deemed risky to teenagers? While I find it hard to believe the Court
would support punishing Frederick for flying a "WINE SiPS 4 JESUS" banner-which could quite reasonably be construed either as a protected religious
message or as a pro-alcohol message--the breathtaking sweep of its opinion
suggests it would.
Although this case began with a silly, nonsensical banner, it ends with the
Court inventing out of whole cloth a special First Amendment rule permitting
the censorship of any student speech that mentions drugs, at least so long as
someone could perceive that speech to contain a latent pro-drug message. Our
First Amendment jurisprudence has identified some categories of expression
that are less deserving of protection than others--fighting words, obscenity, and
commercial speech, to name a few. Rather than reviewing our opinions
discussing such categories, I mention two personal recollections that have no
doubt influenced my conclusion that it would be profoundly unwise to create
special rules for speech about drug and alcohol use.
The Vietnam War is remembered today as an unpopular war. During its early
stages, however, "the dominant opinion" that Justice Harlan mentioned in his
Tinker dissent regarded opposition to the war as unpatriotic, if not treason.
That dominant opinion strongly supported the prosecution of several of those

Robson

350

The First Amendment

who demonstrated in Grant Park during the 1968 Democratic Convention in
Chicago and the vilification of vocal opponents of the war like Julian Bond. In
1965, when the Des Moines students wore their armbands, the school district's
fear that they might "start an argument or cause a disturbance" was well
founded. Tinker. Given that context, there is special force to the Court's
insistence that "our Constitution says we must take that risk; and our history
says that it is this sort of hazardous freedom--this kind of openness--that is the
basis of our national strength and of the independence and vigor of Americans
who grow up and live in this relatively permissive, often disputatious, society."
As we now know, the then-dominant opinion about the Vietnam War was not
etched in stone.
Reaching back still further, the current dominant opinion supporting the war
on drugs in general, and our antimarijuana laws in particular, is reminiscent of
the opinion that supported the nationwide ban on alcohol consumption when I
was a student. While alcoholic beverages are now regarded as ordinary articles
of commerce, their use was then condemned with the same moral fervor that
now supports the war on drugs. The ensuing change in public opinion occurred
much more slowly than the relatively rapid shift in Americans' views on the
Vietnam War, and progressed on a state-by-state basis over a period of many
years. But just as prohibition in the 1920's and early 1930's was secretly
questioned by thousands of otherwise law-abiding patrons of bootleggers and
speakeasies, today the actions of literally millions of otherwise law-abiding
users of marijuana, and of the majority of voters in each of the several States
that tolerate medicinal uses of the product, lead me to wonder whether the fear
of disapproval by those in the majority is silencing opponents of the war on
drugs. Surely our national experience with alcohol should make us wary of
dampening speech suggesting--however inarticulately--that it would be better to
tax and regulate marijuana than to persevere in a futile effort to ban its use
entirely.
Even in high school, a rule that permits only one point of view to be expressed
is less likely to produce correct answers than the open discussion of
countervailing views. Whitney (Brandeis, J., concurring); Abrams (Holmes, J.,
dissenting); Tinker. In the national debate about a serious issue, it is the
expression of the minority's viewpoint that most demands the protection of the
First Amendment. Whatever the better policy may be, a full and frank
discussion of the costs and benefits of the attempt to prohibit the use of
marijuana is far wiser than suppression of speech because it is unpopular.
I respectfully dissent.
JUSTICE BREYER, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART.
This Court need not and should not decide this difficult First Amendment issue
on the merits. Rather, I believe that it should simply hold that qualified
immunity bars the student's claim for monetary damages and say no more. ***

Notes	  	  
1.
The Tinker standard is often called the Tinker “disruption
standard,” yet in Tinker the Court includes in its pronouncement a
concern for the rights of other students. For example:
A student's rights, therefore, do not embrace merely the classroom hours. When
he is in the cafeteria, or on the playing field, or on the campus during the
authorized hours, he may express his opinions, even on controversial subjects
like the conflict in Vietnam, if he does so without "materially and substantially
interfer[ing] with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of
the school" and without colliding with the rights of others. But conduct by the
student, in class or out of it, which for any reason -- whether it stems from time,
place, or type of behavior -- materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial
disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the
constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.

How does attention to the “rights of others” change the constitutional
reasoning? Is it important in Fraser, Hazlewood, or Morse?
2.
How far should Tinker as well as Morse reach “outside” of the
school house gates? In Layshock ex rel. Layshock v. Hermitage Sch. Dist.,
650 F.3d 205 (3d Cir. en banc 2011) and J.S. ex rel. Snyder v. Blue
Mountain Sch. Dist., 650 F.3d 915 (3d Cir. en banc 2011), the Third
Circuit en banc considered two panel opinion cases decided the same
day on similar facts reaching opposite results. Both controversies
involved students who, while off school premises, used a social
networking site - - - myspace.com - - - to malign their principals by
creating false profiles. The en banc opinions found that the speech in
both of these cases was protected by the First Amendment, but there
remained room for finding that off-campus speech could nevertheless be
disciplined under the Tinker standard.
These Third Circuit cases involved student speech directed at
school officials, but what about student-on-student speech that raises
the specter of “cyber-bullying”?

I.	  

Unconstitutional	  Conditions	  and	  Speech	  	  

The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions is not limited to the First
Amendment. It can arise whenever the government attaches conditions
to funding if those conditions effect the exercise of a constitutional right.
For example, if the government requires a person to be sterilized before
she could collect unemployment benefits, this would be an example of
unconstitutional conditions. When the federal government is involved,
doctrine under the Spending Clause, Article I §8 cl. 1, is implicated.
When state or local governments are involved, there may be state
constitutional issues.
There are two opposing views of the doctrine of unconstitutional
conditions:
The most expansive view is that the government cannot impose a
condition on funding unless it could impose that condition directly. In
other words, the government could mandate sterilization as a condition
for unemployment benefits unless it could mandate sterilization generally.
The most restrictive view is that the government can impose any
condition on funding. In other words, the “doctrine” of “unconstitutional
conditions” does not exist. The government can subsidize whatever it
chooses and people are “free” to take the money or to refuse it.
When freedom of speech is the constitutional right at stake in an
unconstitutional conditions case, the issue is further complicated by
questions of whether the government itself is attempting to speak and
whether there are other constitutional considerations.
The major cases on unconstitutional conditions in the First Amendment
speech context are Rust v. Sullivan (1991) and Legal Services Corp. v.
Velazquez (2001).

Services (HHS) regulations which limit the ability of Title X fund recipients to
engage in abortion-related activities. ***

The First Amendment

I.
A.
In 1970, Congress enacted Title X of the Public Health Service Act (Act), which
provides federal funding for family-planning services. The Act authorizes the
Secretary to “make grants to and enter into contracts with public or nonprofit
private entities to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family
planning projects which shall offer a broad range of acceptable and effective
family planning methods and services.” Grants and contracts under Title X
must “be made in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may
promulgate.” Section 1008 of the Act, however, provides that “[n]one of the
funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where
abortion is a method of family planning.” That restriction was intended to
ensure that Title X funds would “be used only to support preventive family
planning services, population research, infertility services, and other related
medical, informational, and educational activities.”
In 1988, the Secretary promulgated new regulations designed to provide “‘clear
and operational guidance’ to grantees about how to preserve the distinction
between Title X programs and abortion as a method of family planning.” The
regulations clarify, through the definition of the term “family planning,” that
Congress intended Title X funds “to be used only to support preventive family
planning services.” (emphasis added). Accordingly, Title X services are limited to
“preconceptional counseling, education, and general reproductive health care,”
and expressly exclude “pregnancy care (including obstetric or prenatal care).”
The regulations “focus the emphasis of the Title X program on its traditional
mission: The provision of preventive family planning services specifically
designed to enable individuals to determine the number and spacing of their
children, while clarifying that pregnant women must be referred to appropriate
prenatal care services.”
The regulations attach three principal conditions on the grant of federal funds
for Title X projects. First, the regulations specify that a “Title X project may not
provide counseling concerning the use of abortion as a method of family
planning or provide referral for abortion as a method of family planning.”
Because Title X is limited to preconceptional services, the program does not
furnish services related to childbirth. Only in the context of a referral out of the
Title X program is a pregnant woman given transitional information. Title X
projects must refer every pregnant client “for appropriate prenatal and/or social
services by furnishing a list of available providers that promote the welfare of
mother and unborn child.” The list may not be used indirectly to encourage or
promote abortion, “such as by weighing the list of referrals in favor of health
care providers which perform abortions, by including on the list of referral
providers health care providers whose principal business is the provision of
abortions, by excluding available providers who do not provide abortions, or by
‘steering’ clients to providers who offer abortion as a method of family
planning.” The Title X project is expressly prohibited from referring a pregnant
woman to an abortion provider, even upon specific request. One permissible
response to such an inquiry is that “the project does not consider abortion an
appropriate method of family planning and therefore does not counsel or refer
for abortion.”

Robson

355

The First Amendment

Second, the regulations broadly prohibit a Title X project from engaging in
activities that “encourage, promote or advocate abortion as a method of family
planning.” Forbidden activities include lobbying for legislation that would
increase the availability of abortion as a method of family planning, developing
or disseminating materials advocating abortion as a method of family planning,
providing speakers to promote abortion as a method of family planning, using
legal action to make abortion available in any way as a method of family
planning, and paying dues to any group that advocates abortion as a method of
family planning as a substantial part of its activities.
Third, the regulations require that Title X projects be organized so that they are
“physically and financially separate” from prohibited abortion activities. To be
deemed physically and financially separate, “a Title X project must have an
objective integrity and independence from prohibited activities. Mere
bookkeeping separation of Title X funds from other monies is not sufficient.”
The regulations provide a list of nonexclusive factors for the Secretary to
consider in conducting a case-by-case determination of objective integrity and
independence, such as the existence of separate accounting records and
separate personnel, and the degree of physical separation of the project from
facilities for prohibited activities.
III

Petitioners contend that the regulations violate the First Amendment by
impermissibly discriminating based on viewpoint because they prohibit “all
discussion about abortion as a lawful option—including counseling, referral,
and the provision of neutral and accurate information about ending a
pregnancy—while compelling the clinic or counselor to provide information that
promotes continuing a pregnancy to term.” They assert that the regulations
violate the “free speech rights of private health care organizations that receive
Title X funds, of their staff, and of their patients” by impermissibly imposing
“viewpoint-discriminatory conditions on government subsidies” and thus
“penaliz [e] speech funded with non-Title X monies.” Because “Title X continues
to fund speech ancillary to pregnancy testing in a manner that is not
evenhanded with respect to views and information about abortion, it invidiously
discriminates on the basis of viewpoint.” Relying on Regan v. Taxation with
Representation of Wash. (1983), and Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland,
(1987), petitioners also assert that while the Government may place certain
conditions on the receipt of federal subsidies, it may not “discriminate
invidiously in its subsidies in such a way as to ‘ai[m] at the suppression of
dangerous ideas.’ ”
There is no question but that the statutory prohibition contained in § 1008 is
constitutional. In Maher v. Roe (1977), we upheld a state welfare regulation
under which Medicaid recipients received payments for services related to
childbirth, but not for nontherapeutic abortions. The Court rejected the claim
that this unequal subsidization worked a violation of the Constitution. We held
that the government may “make a value judgment favoring childbirth over
abortion, and ... implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.”
Here the Government is exercising the authority it possesses under Maher and
Harris v. McRae (1980), to subsidize family planning services which will lead to
conception and childbirth, and declining to “promote or encourage abortion.”

Robson

356

The First Amendment

The Government can, without violating the Constitution, selectively fund a
program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest,
without at the same time funding an alternative program which seeks to deal
with the problem in another way. In so doing, the Government has not
discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund one
activity to the exclusion of the other. “[A] legislature's decision not to subsidize
the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right.” “A refusal to
fund protected activity, without more, cannot be equated with the imposition of
a ‘penalty’ on that activity.” McRae, “There is a basic difference between direct
state interference with a protected activity and state encouragement of an
alternative activity consonant with legislative policy.” Maher.
The challenged regulations implement the statutory prohibition by prohibiting
counseling, referral, and the provision of information regarding abortion as a
method of family planning. They are designed to ensure that the limits of the
federal program are observed. The Title X program is designed not for prenatal
care, but to encourage family planning. A doctor who wished to offer prenatal
care to a project patient who became pregnant could properly be prohibited
from doing so because such service is outside the scope of the federally funded
program. The regulations prohibiting abortion counseling and referral are of the
same ilk; “no funds appropriated for the project may be used in programs where
abortion is a method of family planning,” and a doctor employed by the project
may be prohibited in the course of his project duties from counseling abortion
or referring for abortion. This is not a case of the Government “suppressing a
dangerous idea,” but of a prohibition on a project grantee or its employees from
engaging in activities outside of the project's scope.
To hold that the Government unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of
viewpoint when it chooses to fund a program dedicated to advance certain
permissible goals, because the program in advancing those goals necessarily
discourages alternative goals, would render numerous Government programs
constitutionally suspect. When Congress established a National Endowment for
Democracy to encourage other countries to adopt democratic principles, it was
not constitutionally required to fund a program to encourage competing lines of
political philosophy such as communism and fascism. Petitioners' assertions
ultimately boil down to the position that if the government chooses to subsidize
one protected right, it must subsidize analogous counterpart rights. But the
Court has soundly rejected that proposition. Within far broader limits than
petitioners are willing to concede, when the Government appropriates public
funds to establish a program it is entitled to define the limits of that program.
We believe that petitioners' reliance upon our decision in Arkansas Writers'
Project is misplaced. That case involved a state sales tax which discriminated
between magazines on the basis of their content. Relying on this fact, and on
the fact that the tax “targets a small group within the press,” *** the Court held
the tax invalid. But we have here not the case of a general law singling out a
disfavored group on the basis of speech content, but a case of the Government
refusing to fund activities, including speech, which are specifically excluded
from the scope of the project funded.
Petitioners rely heavily on their claim that the regulations would not, in the
circumstance of a medical emergency, permit a Title X project to refer a woman

Robson

357

The First Amendment

whose pregnancy places her life in imminent peril to a provider of abortions or
abortion-related services. *** On their face, we do not read the regulations to
bar abortion referral or counseling in such circumstances. Abortion counseling
as a “method of family planning” is prohibited, and it does not seem that a
medically necessitated abortion in such circumstances would be the equivalent
of its use as a “method of family planning.” ***
Petitioners also contend that the restrictions on the subsidization of abortionrelated speech contained in the regulations are impermissible because they
condition the receipt of a benefit, in these cases Title X funding, on the
relinquishment of a constitutional right, the right to engage in abortion
advocacy and counseling. ***
[H]ere the Government is not denying a benefit to anyone, but is instead simply
insisting that public funds be spent for the purposes for which they were
authorized. The Secretary's regulations do not force the Title X grantee to give
up abortion-related speech; they merely require that the grantee keep such
activities separate and distinct from Title X activities. Title X expressly
distinguishes between a Title X grantee and a Title X project. The grantee, which
normally is a health-care organization, may receive funds from a variety of
sources for a variety of purposes. The grantee receives Title X funds, however,
for the specific and limited purpose of establishing and operating a Title X
project. The regulations govern the scope of the Title X project's activities, and
leave the grantee unfettered in its other activities. The Title X grantee can
continue to perform abortions, provide abortion-related services, and engage in
abortion advocacy; it simply is required to conduct those activities through
programs that are separate and independent from the project that receives Title
X funds.
In contrast, our “unconstitutional conditions” cases involve situations in which
the Government has placed a condition on the recipient of the subsidy rather
than on a particular program or service, thus effectively prohibiting the
recipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the
federally funded program. In FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., we
invalidated a federal law providing that noncommercial television and radio
stations that receive federal grants may not “engage in editorializing.” Under
that law, a recipient of federal funds was “barred absolutely from all
editorializing” because it “is not able to segregate its activities according to the
source of its funding” and thus “has no way of limiting the use of its federal
funds to all noneditorializing activities.” The effect of the law was that “a
noncommercial educational station that receives only 1% of its overall income
from [federal] grants is barred absolutely from all editorializing” and “barred
from using even wholly private funds to finance its editorial activity.” We
expressly recognized, however, that were Congress to permit the recipient
stations to “establish ‘affiliate’ organizations which could then use the station's
facilities to editorialize with nonfederal funds, such a statutory mechanism
would plainly be valid.” Such a scheme would permit the station “to make
known its views on matters of public importance through its nonfederally
funded, editorializing affiliate without losing federal grants for its
noneditorializing broadcast activities.”

Robson

358

The First Amendment

By requiring that the Title X grantee engage in abortion-related activity
separately from activity receiving federal funding, Congress has, consistent with
our teachings in League of Women Voters and Regan, not denied it the right to
engage in abortion-related activities. Congress has merely refused to fund such
activities out of the public fisc, and the Secretary has simply required a certain
degree of separation from the Title X project in order to ensure the integrity of
the federally funded program.
The same principles apply to petitioners' claim that the regulations abridge the
free speech rights of the grantee's staff. Individuals who are voluntarily
employed for a Title X project must perform their duties in accordance with the
regulation's restrictions on abortion counseling and referral. The employees
remain free, however, to pursue abortion-related activities when they are not
acting under the auspices of the Title X project. The regulations, which govern
solely the scope of the Title X project's activities, do not in any way restrict the
activities of those persons acting as private individuals. The employees' freedom
of expression is limited during the time that they actually work for the project;
but this limitation is a consequence of their decision to accept employment in a
project, the scope of which is permissibly restricted by the funding authority.5
This is not to suggest that funding by the Government, even when coupled with
the freedom of the fund recipients to speak outside the scope of the
Government-funded project, is invariably sufficient to justify Government
control over the content of expression. For example, this Court has recognized
that the existence of a Government “subsidy,” in the form of Government-owned
property, does not justify the restriction of speech in areas that have “been
traditionally open to the public for expressive activity.” Similarly, we have
recognized that the university is a traditional sphere of free expression so
fundamental to the functioning of our society that the Government's ability to
control speech within that sphere by means of conditions attached to the
expenditure of Government funds is restricted by the vagueness and
overbreadth doctrines of the First Amendment. It could be argued by analogy
that traditional relationships such as that between doctor and patient should
enjoy protection under the First Amendment from Government regulation, even
when subsidized by the Government. We need not resolve that question here,
however, because the Title X program regulations do not significantly impinge
upon the doctor-patient relationship. Nothing in them requires a doctor to
represent as his own any opinion that he does not in fact hold. Nor is the
doctor-patient relationship established by the Title X program sufficiently all
encompassing so as to justify an expectation on the part of the patient of
comprehensive medical advice. The program does not provide post conception
medical care, and therefore a doctor's silence with regard to abortion cannot
reasonably be thought to mislead a client into thinking that the doctor does not
consider abortion an appropriate option for her. The doctor is always free to
make clear that advice regarding abortion is simply beyond the scope of the
program. In these circumstances, the general rule that the Government may
choose not to subsidize speech applies with full force.

STEVENS JOINS AS TO PARTS II AND III AND WITH WHOM JUSTICE O’CONNOR JOINS AS
TO PART I, DISSENTING.
I. [OMITTED]
II.
A.
Until today, the Court never has upheld viewpoint-based suppression of speech
simply because that suppression was a condition upon the acceptance of public
funds. Whatever may be the Government's power to condition the receipt of its
largess upon the relinquishment of constitutional rights, it surely does not
extend to a condition that suppresses the recipient's cherished freedom of
speech based solely upon the content or viewpoint of that speech. This rule is a
sound one, for, as the Court often has noted: “ ‘A regulation of speech that is
motivated by nothing more than a desire to curtail expression of a particular
point of view on controversial issues of general interest is the purest example of
a “law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” ’ ” League of Women
Voters. “[A]bove all else, the First Amendment means that government has no
power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject
matter, or its content.”
It cannot seriously be disputed that the counseling and referral provisions at
issue in the present cases constitute content-based regulation of speech. Title X
grantees may provide counseling and referral regarding any of a wide range of
family planning and other topics, save abortion.
The regulations are also clearly viewpoint based. While suppressing speech
favorable to abortion with one hand, the Secretary compels antiabortion speech
with the other. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services'
own description of the regulations makes plain that “Title X projects are
required to facilitate access to prenatal care and social services, including
adoption services, that might be needed by the pregnant client to promote her
well-being and that of her child, while making it abundantly clear that the
project is not permitted to promote abortion by facilitating access to abortion
through the referral process.” (emphasis added).
Moreover, the regulations command that a project refer for prenatal care each
woman diagnosed as pregnant, irrespective of the woman's expressed desire to
continue or terminate her pregnancy. If a client asks directly about abortion, a
Title X physician or counselor is required to say, in essence, that the project
does not consider abortion to be an appropriate method of family planning.
Both requirements are antithetical to the First Amendment. See Wooley v.
Maynard (1977).
The regulations pertaining to “advocacy” are even more explicitly viewpoint
based. These provide: “A Title X project may not encourage, promote or advocate
abortion as a method of family planning.” (emphasis added). They explain: “This
requirement prohibits actions to assist women to obtain abortions or increase
the availability or accessibility of abortion for family planning purposes.” §
(emphasis added). The regulations do not, however, proscribe or even regulate

Robson

360

The First Amendment

anti-abortion advocacy. These are clearly restrictions aimed at the suppression
of “dangerous ideas.”
Remarkably, the majority concludes that “the Government has not
discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund one
activity to the exclusion of the other.” But the majority's claim that the
regulations merely limit a Title X project's speech to preventive or
preconceptional services, rings hollow in light of the broad range of
nonpreventive services that the regulations authorize Title X projects to provide.
By refusing to fund those family-planning projects that advocate abortion
because they advocate abortion, the Government plainly has targeted a
particular viewpoint. The majority's reliance on the fact that the regulations
pertain solely to funding decisions simply begs the question. Clearly, there are
some bases upon which government may not rest its decision to fund or not to
fund. For example, the Members of the majority surely would agree that
government may not base its decision to support an activity upon
considerations of race. As demonstrated above, our cases make clear that
ideological viewpoint is a similarly repugnant ground upon which to base
funding decisions.
The advocacy regulations at issue here, however, are not limited to lobbying but
extend to all speech having the effect of encouraging, promoting, or advocating
abortion as a method of family planning. Thus, in addition to their
impermissible focus upon the viewpoint of regulated speech, the provisions
intrude upon a wide range of communicative conduct, including the very words
spoken to a woman by her physician. By manipulating the content of the
doctor-patient dialogue, the regulations upheld today force each of the
petitioners “to be an instrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological
point of view [he or she] finds unacceptable.” Wooley v. Maynard. This type of
intrusive, ideologically based regulation of speech goes far beyond the narrow
lobbying limitations approved in Regan and cannot be justified simply because
it is a condition upon the receipt of a governmental benefit.
B
The Court concludes that the challenged regulations do not violate the First
Amendment rights of Title X staff members because any limitation of the
employees' freedom of expression is simply a consequence of their decision to
accept employment at a federally funded project. But it has never been
sufficient to justify an otherwise unconstitutional condition upon public
employment that the employee may escape the condition by relinquishing his or
her job. It is beyond question “that a government may not require an individual
to relinquish rights guaranteed him by the First Amendment as a condition of
public employment.”
The majority attempts to circumvent this principle by emphasizing that Title X
physicians and counselors “remain free ... to pursue abortion-related activities
when they are not acting under the auspices of the Title X project.” “The
regulations,” the majority explains, “do not in any way restrict the activities of
those persons acting as private individuals.” Under the majority's reasoning,
the First Amendment could be read to tolerate any governmental restriction
upon an employee's speech so long as that restriction is limited to the funded

Robson

361

The First Amendment

workplace. This is a dangerous proposition, and one the Court has rightly
rejected in the past.
In the cases at bar, the speaker's interest in the communication is both clear
and vital. In addressing the family-planning needs of their clients, the
physicians and counselors who staff Title X projects seek to provide them with
the full range of information and options regarding their health and
reproductive freedom. Indeed, the legitimate expectations of the patient and the
ethical responsibilities of the medical profession demand no less. “The patient's
right of self-decision can be effectively exercised only if the patient possesses
enough information to enable an intelligent choice.... The physician has an
ethical obligation to help the patient make choices from among the therapeutic
alternatives consistent with good medical practice.” *** When a client becomes
pregnant, the full range of therapeutic alternatives includes the abortion option,
and Title X counselors' interest in providing this information is compelling.
The Government's articulated interest in distorting the doctor-patient
dialogue—ensuring that federal funds are not spent for a purpose outside the
scope of the program—falls far short of that necessary to justify the suppression
of truthful information and professional medical opinion regarding
constitutionally protected conduct. Moreover, the offending regulation is not
narrowly tailored to serve this interest. For example, the governmental interest
at stake could be served by imposing rigorous bookkeeping standards to ensure
financial separation or adopting content-neutral rules for the balanced
dissemination of family-planning and health information. By failing to balance
or even to consider the free speech interests claimed by Title X physicians
against the Government's asserted interest in suppressing the speech, the
Court falters in its duty to implement the protection that the First Amendment
clearly provides for this important message.
C
Finally, it is of no small significance that the speech the Secretary would
suppress is truthful information regarding constitutionally protected conduct of
vital importance to the listener. One can imagine no legitimate governmental
interest that might be served by suppressing such information. Concededly, the
abortion debate is among the most divisive and contentious issues that our
Nation has faced in recent years. “But freedom to differ is not limited to things
that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of
its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the
existing order.” West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943).

KENNEDY, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH STEVENS, SOUTER, GINSBURG,
AND BREYER, JJ., JOINED. SCALIA, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION IN WHICH REHNQUIST, C. J.,
AND O’CONNOR AND THOMAS, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
In 1974, Congress enacted the Legal Services Corporation Act. The Act
establishes the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) as a District of Columbia
nonprofit corporation. LSC’s mission is to distribute funds appropriated by
Congress to eligible local grantee organizations “for the purpose of providing
financial support for legal assistance in noncriminal proceedings or matters to
persons financially unable to afford legal assistance.”
LSC grantees consist of hundreds of local organizations governed, in the typical
case, by local boards of directors. In many instances the grantees are funded by
a combination of LSC funds and other public or private sources. The grantee
organizations hire and supervise lawyers to provide free legal assistance to
indigent clients. Each year LSC appropriates funds to grantees or recipients
that hire and supervise lawyers for various professional activities, including
representation of indigent clients seeking welfare benefits.
This suit requires us to decide whether one of the conditions imposed by
Congress on the use of LSC funds violates the First Amendment rights of LSC
grantees and their clients. For purposes of our decision, the restriction, to be
quoted in further detail, prohibits legal representation funded by recipients of
LSC moneys if the representation involves an effort to amend or otherwise
challenge existing welfare law. As interpreted by the LSC and by the
Government, the restriction prevents an attorney from arguing to a court that a
state statute conflicts with a federal statute or that either a state or federal
statute by its terms or in its application is violative of the United States
Constitution.
I.
From the inception of the LSC, Congress has placed restrictions on its use of
funds. For instance, the LSC Act prohibits recipients from making available LSC
funds, program personnel, or equipment to any political party, to any political
campaign, or for use in “advocating or opposing any ballot measures.” The Act
further proscribes use of funds in most criminal proceedings and in litigation
involving non- therapeutic abortions, secondary school desegregation, military
desertion, or violations of the Selective Service statute. Fund recipients are
barred from bringing class-action suits unless express approval is obtained
from LSC.
The restrictions at issue were part of a compromise set of restrictions enacted in
the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (1996
Act), and continued in each subsequent annual appropriations Act. The
relevant portion of §504(a)(16) prohibits funding of any organization

Robson

363

The First Amendment

“that initiates legal representation or participates in any other way, in litigation,
lobbying, or rulemaking, involving an effort to reform a Federal or State welfare
system, except that this paragraph shall not be construed to preclude a
recipient from representing an individual eligible client who is seeking specific
relief from a welfare agency if such relief does not involve an effort to amend or
otherwise challenge existing law in effect on the date of the initiation of the
representation.”

The prohibitions apply to all of the activities of an LSC grantee, including those
paid for by non-LSC funds. We are concerned with the statutory provision
which excludes LSC representation in cases which “involve an effort to amend
or otherwise challenge existing law in effect on the date of the initiation of the
representation.”
In 1997, LSC adopted final regulations clarifying §504(a)(16). LSC interpreted
the statutory provision to allow indigent clients to challenge welfare agency
determinations of benefit ineligibility under interpretations of existing law. For
example, an LSC grantee could represent a welfare claimant who argued that
an agency made an erroneous factual determination or that an agency misread
or misapplied a term contained in an existing welfare statute. According to LSC,
a grantee in that position could argue as well that an agency policy violated
existing law. Under LSC’s interpretation, however, grantees could not accept
representations designed to change welfare laws, much less argue against the
constitutionality or statutory validity of those laws. Even in cases where
constitutional or statutory challenges became apparent after representation was
well under way, LSC advised that its attorneys must withdraw.
II
The United States and LSC rely on Rust v. Sullivan (1991), as support for the
LSC program restrictions. In Rust, Congress established program clinics to provide subsidies for doctors to advise patients on a variety of family planning
topics. Congress did not consider abortion to be within its family planning
objectives, however, and it forbade doctors employed by the program from
discussing abortion with their patients. ***
We upheld the law, reasoning that Congress had not discriminated against
viewpoints on abortion, but had “merely chosen to fund one activity to the
exclusion of the other.” The restrictions were considered necessary “to ensure
that the limits of the federal program [were] observed.” Title X did not single
out a particular idea for suppression because it was dangerous or disfavored;
rather, Congress prohibited Title X doctors from counseling that was outside
the scope of the project.
The Court in Rust did not place explicit reliance on the rationale that the
counseling activities of the doctors under Title X amounted to governmental
speech; when interpreting the holding in later cases, however, we have
explained Rust on this understanding. We have said that viewpoint-based
funding decisions can be sustained in instances in which the government is
itself the speaker, see Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth,
(2000), or instances, like Rust, in which the government “used private speakers
to transmit specific information pertaining to its own program.” Rosenberger v.
Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995). As we said in Rosenberger, “[w]hen the
government disburses public funds to private entities to convey a governRobson

364

The First Amendment

mental message, it may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its
message is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee.” The latitude which
may exist for restrictions on speech where the government’s own message is
being delivered flows in part from our observation that, “[w]hen the government
speaks, for instance to promote its own policies or to advance a particular idea,
it is, in the end, accountable to the electorate and the political process for its
advocacy. If the citizenry objects, newly elected officials later could espouse
some different or contrary position.” Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v.
Southworth.
Neither the latitude for government speech nor its rationale applies to subsidies
for private speech in every instance, however. As we have pointed out, “[i]t does
not follow . . . that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the
[government] does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it
favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private
speakers.”
Although the LSC program differs from the program at issue in Rosenberger in
that its purpose is not to “encourage a diversity of views,” the salient point is
that, like the program in Rosenberger, the LSC program was designed to
facilitate private speech, not to promote a governmental message. Congress
funded LSC grantees to provide attorneys to represent the interests of indigent
clients. In the specific context of §504(a)(16) suits for benefits, an LSC-funded
attorney speaks on the behalf of the client in a claim against the government for
welfare benefits. The lawyer is not the government’s speaker. The attorney
defending the decision to deny benefits will deliver the government’s message in
the litigation. The LSC lawyer, however, speaks on the behalf of his or her
private, indigent client.
The Government has designed this program to use the legal profession and the
established Judiciary of the States and the Federal Government to accomplish
its end of assisting welfare claimants in determination or receipt of their
benefits. The advice from the attorney to the client and the advocacy by the
attorney to the courts cannot be classified as governmental speech even under
a generous understanding of the concept. In this vital respect this suit is
distinguishable from Rust.
The private nature of the speech involved here, and the extent of LSC’s
regulation of private expression, are indicated further by the circumstance that
the Government seeks to use an existing medium of expression and to control it,
in a class of cases, in ways which distort its usual functioning. Where the
government uses or attempts to regulate a particular medium, we have been
informed by its accepted usage in determining whether a particular restriction
on speech is necessary for the program’s purposes and limitations. ***
When the government creates a limited forum for speech, certain restrictions
may be necessary to define the limits and purposes of the program. The same is
true when the government establishes a subsidy for specified ends. Rust v.
Sullivan (1991). As this suit involves a subsidy, limited forum cases *** may not
be controlling in a strict sense, yet they do provide some instruction. Here the
program presumes that private, non-governmental speech is necessary, and a
substantial restriction is placed upon that speech. At oral argument and in its

Robson

The First Amendment

briefs the LSC advised us that lawyers funded in the Government program may
not undertake representation in suits for benefits if they must advise clients
respecting the questionable validity of a statute which defines benefit eligibility
and the payment structure. The limitation forecloses advice or legal assistance
to question the validity of statutes under the Constitution of the United States.
It extends further, it must be noted, so that state statutes inconsistent with
federal law under the Supremacy Clause may be neither challenged nor
questioned.
By providing subsidies to LSC, the Government seeks to facilitate suits for
benefits by using the state and federal courts and the independent bar on
which those courts depend for the proper performance of their duties and
responsibilities. Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and in
presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by
altering the traditional role of the attorneys in much the same way broadcast
systems or student publication networks were changed in the limited forum
cases we have cited. Just as government in those cases could not elect to use a
broadcasting network or a college publication structure in a regime which
prohibits speech necessary to the proper functioning of those systems, it may
not design a subsidy to effect this serious and fundamental restriction on
advocacy of attorneys and the functioning of the judiciary.
LSC has advised us, furthermore, that upon determining a question of statutory
validity is present in any anticipated or pending case or controversy, the LSCfunded attorney must cease the representation at once. This is true whether the
validity issue becomes apparent during initial attorney- client consultations or
in the midst of litigation proceedings. A disturbing example of the restriction
was discussed during oral argument before the Court. It is well understood that
when there are two reasonable constructions for a statute, yet one raises a
constitutional question, the Court should prefer the interpretation which avoids
the constitutional issue. [Ashwander]. Yet, as the LSC advised the Court, if,
during litigation, a judge were to ask an LSC attorney whether there was a
constitutional concern, the LSC attorney simply could not answer.
Interpretation of the law and the Constitution is the primary mission of the
judiciary when it acts within the sphere of its authority to resolve a case or
controversy. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (“It is emphatically
the province and the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is”). An
informed, independent judiciary presumes an informed, independent bar.
Under § 504(a)(16), however, cases would be presented by LSC attorneys who
could not advise the courts of serious questions of statutory validity. The
disability is inconsistent with the proposition that attorneys should present all
the reasonable and well-grounded arguments necessary for proper resolution of
the case. By seeking to prohibit the analysis of certain legal issues and to
truncate presentation to the courts, the enactment under review prohibits
speech and expression upon which courts must depend for the proper exercise
of the judicial power. Congress cannot wrest the law from the Constitution
which is its source. “Those then who controvert the principle that the
constitution is to be considered, in court, as a paramount law, are reduced to
the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the
constitution, and see only the law.”

Robson

366

The First Amendment

The restriction imposed by the statute here threatens severe impairment of the
judicial function. Section 504(a)(16) sifts out cases presenting constitutional
challenges in order to insulate the Government’s laws from judicial inquiry. If
the restriction on speech and legal advice were to stand, the result would be
two tiers of cases. In cases where LSC counsel were attorneys of record, there
would be lingering doubt whether the truncated representation had resulted in
complete analysis of the case, full advice to the client, and proper presentation
to the court. The courts and the public would come to question the adequacy
and fairness of professional representations when the attorney, either
consciously to comply with this statute or unconsciously to continue the
representation despite the statute, avoided all reference to questions of
statutory validity and constitutional authority. A scheme so inconsistent with
accepted separation-of-powers principles is an insufficient basis to sustain or
uphold the restriction on speech.
It is no answer to say the restriction on speech is harmless because, under
LSC’s interpretation of the Act, its attorneys can withdraw. This misses the
point. The statute is an attempt to draw lines around the LSC program to
exclude from litigation those arguments and theories Congress finds
unacceptable but which by their nature are within the province of the courts to
consider.
The restriction on speech is even more problematic because in cases where the
attorney withdraws from a representation, the client is unlikely to find other
counsel. The explicit premise for providing LSC attorneys is the necessity to
make available representation “to persons financially unable to afford legal
assistance.” There often will be no alternative source for the client to receive
vital information respecting constitutional and statutory rights bearing upon
claimed benefits. Thus, with respect to the litigation services Congress has
funded, there is no alternative channel for expression of the advocacy Congress
seeks to restrict. This is in stark contrast to Rust. There, a patient could receive
the approved Title X family planning counseling funded by the Government and
later could consult an affiliate or independent organization to receive abortion
counseling. Unlike indigent clients who seek LSC representation, the patient in
Rust was not required to forfeit the Government-funded advice when she also
received abortion counseling through alternative channels. Because LSC
attorneys must withdraw whenever a question of a welfare statute’s validity
arises, an individual could not obtain joint representation so that the
constitutional challenge would be presented by a non-LSC attorney, and other,
permitted, arguments advanced by LSC counsel.
Finally, LSC and the Government maintain that §504(a)(16) is necessary to
define the scope and contours of the federal program, a condition that ensures
funds can be spent for those cases most immediate to congressional concern. In
support of this contention, they suggest the challenged limitation takes into
account the nature of the grantees’ activities and provides limited congressional
funds for the provision of simple suits for benefits. In petitioners’ view, the
restriction operates neither to maintain the current welfare system nor insulate
it from attack; rather, it helps the current welfare system function in a more
efficient and fair manner by removing from the program complex challenges to
existing welfare laws.

Robson

367

The First Amendment

The effect of the restriction, however, is to prohibit advice or argumentation that
existing welfare laws are unconstitutional or unlawful. Congress cannot recast
a condition on funding as a mere definition of its program in every case, lest the
First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise. Here,
notwithstanding Congress’ purpose to confine and limit its program, the
restriction operates to insulate current welfare laws from constitutional
scrutiny and certain other legal challenges, a condition implicating central First
Amendment concerns. In no lawsuit funded by the Government can the LSC
attorney, speaking on behalf of a private client, challenge existing welfare laws.
As a result, arguments by indigent clients that a welfare statute is unlawful or
unconstitutional cannot be expressed in this Government- funded program for
petitioning the courts, even though the program was created for litigation
involving welfare benefits, and even though the ordinary course of litigation
involves the expression of theories and postulates on both, or multiple, sides of
an issue.
It is fundamental that the First Amendment “‘was fashioned to assure
unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social
changes desired by the people.’ ” New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964) (quoting
Roth v. United States (1957)). There can be little doubt that the LSC Act funds
constitutionally protected expression; and in the context of this statute there is
no programmatic message of the kind recognized in Rust and which sufficed
there to allow the Government to specify the advice deemed necessary for its
legitimate objectives. This serves to distinguish §504(a)(16) from any of the Title
X program restrictions upheld in Rust, and to place it beyond any congressional
funding condition approved in the past by this Court.
Congress was not required to fund an LSC attorney to represent indigent
clients; and when it did so, it was not required to fund the whole range of legal
representations or relationships. The LSC and the United States, however, in
effect ask us to permit Congress to define the scope of the litigation it funds to
exclude certain vital theories and ideas. The attempted restriction is designed to
insulate the Government’s interpretation of the Constitution from judicial
challenge. The Constitution does not permit the Government to confine litigants
and their attorneys in this manner. We must be vigilant when Congress
imposes rules and conditions which in effect insulate its own laws from
legitimate judicial challenge. Where private speech is involved, even Congress’
antecedent funding decision cannot be aimed at the suppression of ideas
thought inimical to the Government’s own interest.
For the reasons we have set forth, the funding condition is invalid. *** The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

Section 504(a)(16) of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations
Act of 1996 (Appropriations Act) defines the scope of a federal spending
program. It does not directly regulate speech, and it neither establishes a public
forum nor discriminates on the basis of viewpoint. The Court agrees with all
this, yet applies a novel and unsupportable interpretation of our public-forum

The First Amendment

precedents to declare §504(a)(16) facially unconstitutional. This holding not
only has no foundation in our jurisprudence; it is flatly contradicted by a recent
decision that is on all fours with the present cases. Having found the limitation
upon the spending program unconstitutional, the Court then declines to
consider the question of severability, allowing a judgment to stand that lets the
program go forward under a version of the statute Congress never enacted. I
respectfully dissent from both aspects of the judgment.
I [omitted] [description of LSC Act]
II
The LSC Act is a federal subsidy program, not a federal regulatory program, and
“[t]here is a basic difference between [the two].” Maher v. Roe (1977).
Regulations directly restrict speech; subsidies do not. Subsidies, it is true, may
indirectly abridge speech, but only if the funding scheme is “ ‘manipulated’ to
have a ‘coercive effect’ ” on those who do not hold the subsidized position.
Proving unconstitutional coercion is difficult enough when the spending
program has universal coverage and excludes only certain speech—such as a
tax exemption scheme excluding lobbying expenses. The Court has found such
programs un- constitutional only when the exclusion was “aimed at the
suppression of dangerous ideas.” Proving the requisite coercion is harder still
when a spending program is not universal but limited, providing benefits to a
restricted number of recipients, see Rust v. Sullivan. The Court has found such
selective spending unconstitutionally coercive only once, when the government
created a public forum with the spending program but then discriminated in
distributing funding within the forum on the basis of view-point. When the
limited spending program does not create a public forum, proving coercion is
virtually impossible, because simply denying a subsidy “does not ‘coerce’ belief,”
and because the criterion of unconstitutionality is whether denial of the subsidy
threatens “to drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.” Absent
such a threat, “the Government may allocate . . . funding according to criteria
that would be impermissible were direct regulation of speech or a criminal
penalty at stake.”
In Rust v. Sullivan, the Court applied these principles to a statutory scheme that
is in all relevant respects indistinguishable from §504(a)(16). The statute in Rust
authorized grants for the provision of family planning services, but provided
that “[n]one of the funds . . . shall be used in programs where abortion is a
method of family planning.” Valid regulations implementing the statute required
funding recipients to refer pregnant clients “for appropriate prenatal . . .
services by furnishing a list of avail- able providers that promote the welfare of
mother and unborn child,” but forbade them to refer a pregnant woman
specifically to an abortion provider, even upon request. We rejected a First
Amendment free-speech challenge to the funding scheme, explaining that “[t]he
Government can, without violating the Constitution, selectively fund a program
to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest, without at
the same time funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the
problem another way.” This was not, we said, the type of “discriminat[ion] on
the basis of viewpoint” that triggers strict scrutiny, , because the “ ‘decision not
to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right,’”

Robson

369

The First Amendment

The same is true here. The LSC Act, like the scheme in Rust, does not create a
public forum. Far from encouraging a diversity of views, it has always, as the
Court accurately states, “placed restrictions on its use of funds.” Nor does
§504(a)(16) discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, since it funds neither
challenges to nor defenses of existing welfare law. The provision simply declines
to subsidize a certain class of litigation, and under Rust that decision “does not
infringe the right” to bring such litigation. The Court’s repeated claims that §
504(a)(16) “restricts” and “prohibits” speech, and “insulates” laws from judicial
review, are simply baseless. No litigant who, in the absence of LSC funding,
would bring a suit challenging existing welfare law is deterred from doing so by
§504(a)(16). Rust thus controls these cases and compels the conclusion that
§504(a)(16) is constitutional.
The Court contends that Rust is different because the program at issue
subsidized government speech, while the LSC funds private speech. This is so
unpersuasive it hardly needs response. If the private doctors’ confidential
advice to their patients at issue in Rust constituted “government speech,” it is
hard to imagine what subsidized speech would not be government speech.
Moreover, the majority’s contention that the subsidized speech in these cases is
not government speech because the lawyers have a professional obligation to
represent the interests of their clients founders on the reality that the doctors in
Rust had a professional obligation to serve the interests of their patients —
which at the time of Rust we had held to be highly relevant to the permissible
scope of federal regulation. Even respondents agree that “the true speaker in
Rust was not the government, but a doctor.”
The Court further asserts that these cases are different from Rust because the
welfare funding restriction “seeks to use an existing medium of expression and
to control it . . . in ways which distort its usual functioning.” This is wrong on
both the facts and the law. It is wrong on the law because there is utterly no
precedent for the novel and facially implausible proposition that the First
Amendment has anything to do with government funding that—though it does
not actually abridge anyone’s speech—“distorts an existing medium of
expression.” None of the three cases cited by the Court mentions such an odd
principle. ***
The Court’s “nondistortion” principle is also wrong on the facts, since there is
no basis for believing that §504(a)(16), by causing “cases [to] be presented by
LSC attorneys who [can]not advise the courts of serious questions of statutory
validity,” will distort the operation of the courts. It may well be that the bar of
§504(a)(16) will cause LSC-funded attorneys to decline or to withdraw from
cases that involve statutory validity. But that means at most that fewer
statutory challenges to welfare laws will be presented to the courts because of
the unavailability of free legal services for that purpose. So what? The same
result would ensue from excluding LSC-funded lawyers from welfare litigation
entirely. It is not the mandated, nondistortable function of the courts to inquire
into all “serious questions of statutory validity” in all cases. Courts must
consider only those questions of statutory validity that are presented by litigants,
and if the Government chooses not to subsidize the presentation of some such
questions, that in no way “distorts” the courts’ role.
The only conceivable argument that can be made for distinguishing Rust is that

Robson

370

The First Amendment

there even patients who wished to receive abortion counseling could receive the
nonabortion services that the Government-funded clinic offered, whereas here
some potential LSC clients who wish to receive representation on a benefits
claim that does not challenge the statutes will be unable to do so because their
cases raise a reform claim that an LSC lawyer may not present. This difference,
of course, is required by the same ethical canons that the Court elsewhere does
not wish to distort. Rather than sponsor “truncated representation,” Congress
chose to subsidize only those cases in which the attorneys it subsidized could
work freely. And it is impossible to see how this difference from Rust has any
bearing upon the First Amendment question, which, to repeat, is whether the
funding scheme is “‘manipulated’ to have a ‘coercive effect’ ” on those who do
not hold the subsidized position. It could be claimed to have such an effect if
the client in a case ineligible for LSC representation could eliminate the
ineligibility by waiving the claim that the statute is invalid; but he cannot. No
conceivable coercive effect exists.
This has been a very long discussion to make a point that is embarrassingly
simple: The LSC subsidy neither prevents anyone from speaking nor coerces
anyone to change speech, and is indistinguishable in all relevant respects from
the subsidy upheld in Rust v. Sullivan. There is no legitimate basis for declaring
§ 504(a)(16) facially unconstitutional.

In National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569 (1998),

requiring “taking into consideration general standards of decency and
respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public” in the
award of prestigious National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grants to
artists.
Only Justice Souter dissented, concluding that such a
requirement, even in the context of funding, was “viewpoint
discrimination.” The Court’s opinion, authored by Justice O’Connor,
stated:
as we held in Rust, Congress may “selectively fund a program to encourage
certain activities it believes to be in the public interest, without at the same time
funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem in another
way.” In doing so, “the Government has not discriminated on the basis of
viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other.”

CONCURRING. ROBERTS, J. AND REED, J., DISSENTING. FRANKFURTER, J., DISSENTING WITH
OPINION.

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Following the decision by this Court on June 3, 1940, in Minersville School
District v. Gobitis, the West Virginia legislature amended its statutes to require
all schools therein to conduct courses of instruction in history, civics, and in
the Constitutions of the United States and of the State "for the purpose of
teaching, fostering and perpetuating the ideals, principles and spirit of
Americanism, and increasing the knowledge of the organization and machinery
of the government." Appellant Board of Education was directed, with advice of
the State Superintendent of Schools, to "prescribe the courses of study covering
these subjects" for public schools. ***
Robson

372

The First Amendment

The Board of Education on January 9, 1942, adopted a resolution containing
recitals taken largely from the Court's Gobitis opinion and ordering that the
salute to the flag become "a regular part of the program of activities in the
public schools," that all teachers and pupils "shall be required to participate in
the salute honoring the Nation represented by the Flag; provided, however, that
refusal to salute the Flag be regarded as an act of insubordination, and shall be
dealt with accordingly."
The resolution originally required the "commonly accepted salute to the Flag"
which it defined. Objections to the salute as "being too much like Hitler's" were
raised. *** Some modification appears to have been made in deference to these
objections, but no concession was made to Jehovah's Witnesses. What is now
required is the "stiff-arm" salute, the saluter to keep the right hand raised with
palm turned up while the following is repeated: "I pledge allegiance to the Flag
of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands; one
Nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
Failure to conform is "insubordination" dealt with by expulsion. Readmission is
denied by statute until compliance. Meanwhile the expelled child is "unlawfully
absent" and may be proceeded against as a delinquent. His parents or
guardians are liable to prosecution, and if convicted are subject to fine not
exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.
Appellees, citizens of the United States and of West Virginia, brought suit in the
United States District Court for themselves and others similarly situated asking
its injunction to restrain enforcement of these laws and regulations against
Jehovah's Witnesses. The Witnesses are an unincorporated body teaching that
the obligation imposed by law of God is superior to that of laws enacted by
temporal government. Their religious beliefs include a literal version of Exodus,
Chapter 20, verses 4 and 5, which says: "Thou shalt not make unto thee any
graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in
the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow
down thyself to them nor serve them." They consider that the flag is an "image"
within this command. For this reason they refuse to salute it.
This case calls upon us to reconsider a precedent decision, as the Court
throughout its history often has been required to do. Before turning to the
Gobitis case, however, it is desirable to notice certain characteristics by which
this controversy is distinguished.
The freedom asserted by these appellees does not bring them into collision with
rights asserted by any other individual. It is such conflicts which most
frequently require intervention of the State to determine where the rights of one
end and those of another begin. But the refusal of these persons to participate
in the ceremony does not interfere with or deny rights of others to do so. Nor is
there any question in this case that their behavior is peaceable and orderly. The
sole conflict is between authority and rights of the individual. The State asserts
power to condition access to public education on making a prescribed sign and
profession and at the same time to coerce attendance by punishing both parent

Robson

373

The First Amendment

and child. The latter stand on a right of self-determination in matters that
touch individual opinion and personal attitude.
As the present CHIEF JUSTICE said in dissent in the Gobitis case, the State
may "require teaching by instruction and study of all in our history and in the
structure and organization of our government, including the guaranties of civil
liberty, which tend to inspire patriotism and love of country." Here, however, we
are dealing with a compulsion of students to declare a belief. They are not
merely made acquainted with the flag salute so that they may be informed as to
what it is or even what it means. The issue here is whether this slow and easily
neglected route to aroused loyalties constitutionally may be short-cut by
substituting a compulsory salute and slogan. ***
There is no doubt that, in connection with the pledges, the flag salute is a form
of utterance. Symbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating
ideas. The use of an emblem or flag to symbolize some system, idea, institution,
or personality, is a short cut from mind to mind. Causes and nations, political
parties, lodges and ecclesiastical groups seek to knit the loyalty of their
followings to a flag or banner, a color or design. The State announces rank,
function, and authority through crowns and maces, uniforms and black robes;
the church speaks through the Cross, the Crucifix, the altar and shrine, and
clerical raiment. Symbols of State often convey political ideas just as religious
symbols come to convey theological ones. Associated with many of these
symbols are appropriate gestures of acceptance or respect: a salute, a bowed or
bared head, a bended knee. A person gets from a symbol the meaning he puts
into it, and what is one man's comfort and inspiration is another's jest and
scorn.
Over a decade ago Chief Justice Hughes led this Court in holding that the
display of a red flag as a symbol of opposition by peaceful and legal means to
organized government was protected by the free speech guaranties of the
Constitution. Here it is the State that employs a flag as a symbol of adherence
to government as presently organized. It requires the individual to communicate
by word and sign his acceptance of the political ideas it thus bespeaks.
Objection to this form of communication when coerced is an old one, well
known to the framers of the Bill of Rights. [fn: “Early Christians were frequently
persecuted for their refusal to participate in ceremonies before the statue of the
emperor or other symbol of imperial authority. The story of William Tell's
sentence to shoot an apple off his son's head for refusal to salute a bailiff's hat
is an ancient one. 21 ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA (14th ed.) 911-912. The
Quakers, William Penn included, suffered punishment, rather than uncover
their heads in deference to any civil authority. BRAITHWAITE, THE BEGINNINGS OF
QUAKERISM (1912) 200, 229-230, 232-233, 447, 451; FOX, QUAKERS
COURAGEOUS (1941) 113.”]
It is also to be noted that the compulsory flag salute and pledge requires
affirmation of a belief and an attitude of mind. It is not clear whether the
regulation contemplates that pupils forego any contrary convictions of their own
and become unwilling converts to the prescribed ceremony or whether it will be

Robson

374

The First Amendment

acceptable if they simulate assent by words without belief and by a gesture
barren of meaning. It is now a commonplace that censorship or suppression of
expression of opinion is tolerated by our Constitution only when the expression
presents a clear and present danger of action of a kind the State is empowered
to prevent and punish. It would seem that involuntary affirmation could be
commanded only on even more immediate and urgent grounds than silence.
But here the power of compulsion is invoked without any allegation that
remaining passive during a flag salute ritual creates a clear and present danger
that would justify an effort even to muffle expression. To sustain the
compulsory flag salute we are required to say that a Bill of Rights which guards
the individual's right to speak his own mind, left it open to public authorities to
compel him to utter what is not in his mind.
Whether the First Amendment to the Constitution will permit officials to order
observance of ritual of this nature does not depend upon whether as a
voluntary exercise we would think it to be good, bad or merely innocuous. Any
credo of nationalism is likely to include what some disapprove or to omit what
others think essential, and to give off different overtones as it takes on different
accents or interpretations. If official power exists to coerce acceptance of any
patriotic creed, what it shall contain cannot be decided by courts, but must be
largely discretionary with the ordaining authority, whose power to prescribe
would no doubt include power to amend. Hence validity of the asserted power to
force an American citizen publicly to profess any statement of belief or to
engage in any ceremony of assent to one, presents questions of power that must
be considered independently of any idea we may have as to the utility of the
ceremony in question.
Nor does the issue as we see it turn on one's possession of particular religious
views or the sincerity with which they are held. While religion supplies
appellees' motive for enduring the discomforts of making the issue in this case,
many citizens who do not share these religious views hold such a compulsory
rite to infringe constitutional liberty of the individual. It is not necessary to
inquire whether non-conformist beliefs will exempt from the duty to salute
unless we first find power to make the salute a legal duty.
The Gobitis decision, however, assumed, as did the argument in that case and
in this, that power exists in the State to impose the flag salute discipline upon
school children in general. The Court only examined and rejected a claim based
on religious beliefs of immunity from an unquestioned general rule. The
question which underlies the flag salute controversy is whether such a
ceremony so touching matters of opinion and political attitude may be imposed
upon the individual by official authority under powers committed to any
political organization under our Constitution. We examine rather than assume
existence of this power and, against this broader definition of issues in this
case, reexamine specific grounds assigned for the Gobitis decision.
It was said that the flag-salute controversy confronted the Court with "the
problem which Lincoln cast in memorable dilemma: `Must a government of

Robson

375

The First Amendment

necessity be too strong for the liberties of its people, or too weak to maintain its
own existence?'" and that the answer must be in favor of strength.
We think these issues may be examined free of pressure or restraint growing
out of such considerations.
It may be doubted whether Mr. Lincoln would have thought that the strength of
government to maintain itself would be impressively vindicated by our
confirming power of the State to expel a handful of children from school. Such
oversimplification, so handy in political debate, often lacks the precision
necessary to postulates of judicial reasoning. If validly applied to this problem,
the utterance cited would resolve every issue of power in favor of those in
authority and would require us to override every liberty thought to weaken or
delay execution of their policies.
Government of limited power need not be anemic government. Assurance that
rights are secure tends to diminish fear and jealousy of strong government, and
by making us feel safe to live under it makes for its better support. Without
promise of a limiting Bill of Rights it is doubtful if our Constitution could have
mustered enough strength to enable its ratification. To enforce those rights
today is not to choose weak government over strong government. It is only to
adhere as a means of strength to individual freedom of mind in preference to
officially disciplined uniformity for which history indicates a disappointing and
disastrous end.
The subject now before us exemplifies this principle. Free public education, if
faithful to the ideal of secular instruction and political neutrality, will not be
partisan or enemy of any class, creed, party, or faction. If it is to impose any
ideological discipline, however, each party or denomination must seek to
control, or failing that, to weaken the influence of the educational system.
Observance of the limitations of the Constitution will not weaken government in
the field appropriate for its exercise.
The Gobitis opinion reasoned that this is a field "where courts possess no
marked and certainly no controlling competence," that it is committed to the
legislatures as well as the courts to guard cherished liberties and that it is
constitutionally appropriate to "fight out the wise use of legislative authority in
the forum of public opinion and before legislative assemblies rather than to
transfer such a contest to the judicial arena," since all the "effective means of
inducing political changes are left free."
The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the
vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of
majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by
the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press,
freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be
submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.

The First Amendment

In weighing arguments of the parties it is important to distinguish between the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as an instrument for
transmitting the principles of the First Amendment and those cases in which it
is applied for its own sake. The test of legislation which collides with the
Fourteenth Amendment, because it also collides with the principles of the First,
is much more definite than the test when only the Fourteenth is involved. Much
of the vagueness of the due process clause disappears when the specific
prohibitions of the First become its standard. The right of a State to regulate,
for example, a public utility may well include, so far as the due process test is
concerned, power to impose all of the restrictions which a legislature may have
a "rational basis" for adopting. But freedoms of speech and of press, of
assembly, and of worship may not be infringed on such slender grounds. They
are susceptible of restriction only to prevent grave and immediate danger to
interests which the State may lawfully protect. It is important to note that while
it is the Fourteenth Amendment which bears directly upon the State it is the
more specific limiting principles of the First Amendment that finally govern this
case.
Nor does our duty to apply the Bill of Rights to assertions of official authority
depend upon our possession of marked competence in the field where the
invasion of rights occurs. True, the task of translating the majestic generalities
of the Bill of Rights, conceived as part of the pattern of liberal government in
the eighteenth century, into concrete restraints on officials dealing with the
problems of the twentieth century, is one to disturb self-confidence. These
principles grew in soil which also produced a philosophy that the individual was
the center of society, that his liberty was attainable through mere absence of
governmental restraints, and that government should be entrusted with few
controls and only the mildest supervision over men's affairs. We must
transplant these rights to a soil in which the laissez-faire concept or principle of
non-interference has withered at least as to economic affairs, and social
advancements are increasingly sought through closer integration of society and
through expanded and strengthened governmental controls. These changed
conditions often deprive precedents of reliability and cast us more than we
would choose upon our own judgment. But we act in these matters not by
authority of our competence but by force of our commissions. We cannot,
because of modest estimates of our competence in such specialties as public
education, withhold the judgment that history authenticates as the function of
this Court when liberty is infringed.
Lastly, and this is the very heart of the Gobitis opinion, it reasons that "National
unity is the basis of national security," that the authorities have "the right to
select appropriate means for its attainment," and hence reaches the conclusion
that such compulsory measures toward "national unity" are constitutional.
Upon the verity of this assumption depends our answer in this case.
The case is made difficult not because the principles of its decision are obscure
but because the flag involved is our own. Nevertheless, we apply the limitations
of the Constitution with no fear that freedom to be intellectually and spiritually
diverse or even contrary will disintegrate the social organization. To believe that

Robson

377

The First Amendment

patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and
spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an unflattering
estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds. We can have intellectual
individualism and the rich cultural diversities that we owe to exceptional minds
only at the price of occasional eccentricity and abnormal attitudes. When they
are so harmless to others or to the State as those we deal with here, the price is
not too great. But freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter
much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the
right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order.
If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official,
high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism,
religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act
their faith therein. If there are any circumstances which permit an exception,
they do not now occur to us.
We think the action of the local authorities in compelling the flag salute and
pledge transcends constitutional limitations on their power and invades the
sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment to
our Constitution to reserve from all official control.
The decision of this Court in Minersville School District v. Gobitis and the
holdings of those few per curiam decisions which preceded and foreshadowed it
are overruled, and the judgment enjoining enforcement of the West Virginia
Regulation is Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, DISSENTING.
One who belongs to the most vilified and persecuted minority in history is not
likely to be insensible to the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution. Were my
purely personal attitude relevant I should wholeheartedly associate myself with
the general libertarian views in the Court's opinion, representing as they do the
thought and action of a lifetime. But as judges we are neither Jew nor Gentile,
neither Catholic nor agnostic. We owe equal attachment to the Constitution and
are equally bound by our judicial obligations whether we derive our citizenship
from the earliest or the latest immigrants to these shores. As a member of this
Court I am not justified in writing my private notions of policy into the
Constitution, no matter how deeply I may cherish them or how mischievous I
may deem their disregard. The duty of a judge who must decide which of two
claims before the Court shall prevail, that of a State to enact and enforce laws
within its general competence or that of an individual to refuse obedience
because of the demands of his conscience, is not that of the ordinary person. It
can never be emphasized too much that one's own opinion about the wisdom or
evil of a law should be excluded altogether when one is doing one's duty on the
bench. The only opinion of our own even looking in that direction that is
material is our opinion whether legislators could in reason have enacted such a
law. In the light of all the circumstances, including the history of this question
in this Court, it would require more daring than I possess to deny that
reasonable legislators could have taken the action which is before us for review.

Robson

378

The First Amendment

Most unwillingly, therefore, I must differ from my brethren with regard to
legislation like this. I cannot bring my mind to believe that the "liberty" secured
by the Due Process Clause gives this Court authority to deny to the State of
West Virginia the attainment of that which we all recognize as a legitimate
legislative end, namely, the promotion of good citizenship, by employment of the
means here chosen.
Law is concerned with external behavior and not with the inner life of man. It
rests in large measure upon compulsion. Socrates lives in history partly
because he gave his life for the conviction that duty of obedience to secular law
does not presuppose consent to its enactment or belief in its virtue. The consent
upon which free government rests is the consent that comes from sharing in the
process of making and unmaking laws. The state is not shut out from a domain
because the individual conscience may deny the state's claim. The individual
conscience may profess what faith it chooses. It may affirm and promote that
faith — in the language of the Constitution, it may "exercise" it freely — but it
cannot thereby restrict community action through political organs in matters of
community concern, so long as the action is not asserted in a discriminatory
way either openly or by stealth. One may have the right to practice one's
religion and at the same time owe the duty of formal obedience to laws that run
counter to one's beliefs. Compelling belief implies denial of opportunity to
combat it and to assert dissident views. Such compulsion is one thing. Quite
another matter is submission to conformity of action while denying its wisdom
or virtue and with ample opportunity for seeking its change or abrogation.
The flag salute exercise has no kinship whatever to the oath tests so odious in
history. For the oath test was one of the instruments for suppressing heretical
beliefs. Saluting the flag suppresses no belief nor curbs it. Children and their
parents may believe what they please, avow their belief and practice it. It is not
even remotely suggested that the requirement for saluting the flag involves the
slightest restriction against the fullest opportunity on the part both of the
children and of their parents to dis-avow as publicly as they choose to do so the
meaning that others attach to the gesture of salute. All channels of affirmative
free expression are open to both children and parents. Had we before us any act
of the state putting the slightest curbs upon such free expression, I should not
lag behind any member of this Court in striking down such an invasion of the
right to freedom of thought and freedom of speech protected by the
Constitution.
Of course patriotism can not be enforced by the flag salute. But neither can the
liberal spirit be enforced by judicial invalidation of illiberal legislation. Our
constant preoccupation with the constitutionality of legislation rather than with
its wisdom tends to preoccupation of the American mind with a false value. The
tendency of focusing attention on constitutionality is to make constitutionality
synonymous with wisdom, to regard a law as all right if it is constitutional.
Such an attitude is a great enemy of liberalism. Particularly in legislation
affecting freedom of thought and freedom of speech much which should offend
a free-spirited society is constitutional. Reliance for the most precious interests
of civilization, therefore, must be found outside of their vindication in courts of

law. Only a persistent positive translation of the faith of a free society into the
convictions and habits and actions of a community is the ultimate reliance
against unabated temptations to fetter the human spirit.

INSOFAR AS IT AFFIRMS THE DISTRICT COURT'S ISSUANCE OF AN INJUNCTION. WHITE, J., FILED A
OPINION DISSENTING IN PART, IN WHICH BLACKMUN AND REHNQUIST, JJ., JOINED. REHNQUIST, J.,
FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH BLACKMUN, J., JOINED.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The issue on appeal is whether the State of New Hampshire may
constitutionally enforce criminal sanctions against persons who cover the motto
"Live Free or Die" on passenger vehicle license plates because that motto is
repugnant to their moral and religious beliefs.
Since 1969, New Hampshire has required that noncommercial vehicles bear
license plates embossed with the state motto, "Live Free or Die." Another New
Hampshire statute makes it a misdemeanor "knowingly [to obscure] . . . the
figures or letters on any number plate." The term "letters" in this section has
been interpreted by the State's highest court to include the state motto.
Appellees George Maynard and his wife Maxine are followers of the Jehovah's
Witnesses faith. The Maynards consider the New Hampshire State motto to be
repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs, and therefore assert it
objectionable to disseminate this message by displaying it on their automobiles.
Pursuant to these beliefs, the Maynards began early in 1974 to cover up the
motto on their license plates. [On three different occasions, George Maynard
was charged with violating the New Hampshire statutory scheme. He was found
guilty, fined, and then sentenced to 15 days jail for failure to pay the fines.]
The District Court held that, by covering up the state motto "Live Free or Die"
on his automobile license plate, Mr. Maynard was engaging in symbolic speech,
and that New Hampshire's interest in the enforcement of its defacement statute
is not sufficient to justify the restriction on [appellee's] constitutionally
protected expression. We find it unnecessary to pass on the "symbolic speech"
issue, since we find more appropriate First Amendment grounds to affirm the
judgment of the District Court. We turn instead to what, in our view, is the
essence of appellees' objection to the requirement that they display the motto
"Live Free or Die" on their automobile license plates. This is succinctly
summarized in the statement made by Mr. Maynard in his affidavit filed with
the District Court:

Robson

380

The First Amendment

I refuse to be coerced by the State into advertising a slogan which I find morally,
ethically, religiously and politically abhorrent.

We are thus faced with the question of whether the State may constitutionally
require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an ideological
message by displaying it on his private property in a manner and for the
express purpose that it be observed and read by the public. We hold that the
State may not do so.
We begin with the proposition that the right of freedom of thought protected by
the First Amendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely
and the right to refrain from speaking at all. A system which secures the right
to proselytize religious, political, and ideological causes must also guarantee the
concomitant right to decline to foster such concepts. The right to speak and the
right to refrain from speaking are complementary components of the broader
concept of "individual freedom of mind."
The Court in Barnette, was faced with a state statute which required public
school students to participate in daily public ceremonies by honoring the flag
both with words and traditional salute gestures. *** Compelling the affirmative
act of a flag salute involved a more serious infringement upon personal liberties
than the passive act of carrying the state motto on a license plate, but the
difference is essentially one of degree.
***New Hampshire's statute in effect requires that appellees use their private
property as a "mobile billboard" for the State's ideological message -- or suffer a
penalty, as Maynard already has. As a condition to driving an automobile -- a
virtual necessity for most Americans -- the Maynards must display "Live Free or
Die" to hundreds of people each day. The fact that most individuals agree with
the thrust of New Hampshire's motto is not the test; most Americans also find
the flag salute acceptable. The First Amendment protects the right of
individuals to hold a point of view different from the majority, and to refuse to
foster, in the way New Hampshire commands, an idea they find morally
objectionable.
Identifying the Maynards' interests as implicating First Amendment protections
does not end our inquiry however. We must also determine whether the State's
countervailing interest is sufficiently compelling to justify requiring appellees to
display the state motto on their license plates. See, e.g., United States v. O'Brien,
(1968). The two interests advanced by the State are that display of the motto (1)
facilitates the identification of passenger vehicles, and (2) promotes appreciation
of history, individualism, and state pride.
The State first points out that passenger vehicles, but not commercial, trailer,
or other vehicles are required to display the state motto. Thus, the argument
proceeds, officers of the law are more easily able to determine whether
passenger vehicles are carrying the proper plates. However, the record here
reveals that New Hampshire passenger license plates normally consist of a
specific configuration of letters and numbers, which makes them readily

Robson

381

The First Amendment

distinguishable from other types of plates, even without reference to the state
motto. Even were we to credit the State's reasons, and “even though the
governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that purpose cannot be
pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the
end can be more narrowly achieved. The breadth of legislative abridgment must
be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic
purpose.”
The State's second claimed interest is not ideologically neutral. The State is
seeking to communicate to others an official view as to proper appreciation of
history, state pride, and individualism. Of course, the State may legitimately
pursue such interests in any number of ways. However, where the State's
interest is to disseminate an ideology, no matter how acceptable to some, such
interest cannot outweigh an individual's First Amendment right to avoid
becoming the courier for such message.
We conclude that the State of New Hampshire my not require appellees to
display the state motto upon their vehicle license plates; and, accordingly, we
affirm the judgment of the District Court.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, WITH WHOM MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN JOINS, DISSENTING.
The Court holds that a State is barred by the Federal Constitution from
requiring that the state motto be displayed on a state license plate. The path
that the Court travels to reach this result demonstrates the difficulty in
supporting it. The Court holds that the required display of the motto is an
unconstitutional "required affirmation of belief." The District Court, however,
expressly refused to consider this contention, *** found for appellees on the
ground that the obscuring of the motto was protected "symbolic speech." This
Court, in relying upon a ground expressly avoided by the District Court,
appears to disagree with the ground adopted by the District Court. ***
I not only agree with the Court's implicit recognition that there is no protected
"symbolic speech" in this case, but I think that that conclusion goes far to
undermine the Court's ultimate holding that there is an element of protected
expression here. The State has not forced appellees to "say" anything, and it
has not forced them to communicate ideas with nonverbal actions reasonably
likened to "speech," such as wearing a lapel button promoting a political
candidate or waving a flag as a symbolic gesture. The State has simply required
that all noncommercial automobiles bear license tags with the state motto, "Live
Free or Die." Appellees have not been forced to affirm or reject that motto; they
are simply required by the State, under its police power, to carry a state auto
license tag for identification and registration purposes.
***[T]he Court relies almost solely on Board of Education v. Barnette (1943). The
Court cites Barnette for the proposition that there is a constitutional right, in
some cases, to "refrain from speaking." What the Court does not demonstrate is
that there is any "speech" or "speaking" in the context of this case. The Court
also relies upon the "right to decline to foster [religious, political, and

Robson

382

The First Amendment

ideological] concepts," and treats the state law in this case as if it were forcing
appellees to proselytize, or to advocate an ideological point of view. But this
begs the question. The issue, unconfronted by the Court, is whether appellees,
in displaying, as they are required to do, state license tags, the format of which
is known to all as having been prescribed by the State, would be considered to
be advocating political or ideological views.
The Court recognizes, as it must, that this case substantially differs from
Barnette, in which school children were forced to recite the pledge of allegiance
while giving the flag salute. However, the Court states "the difference is
essentially one of degree." But having recognized the rather obvious differences
between these two cases, the Court does not explain why the same result
should obtain. The Court suggests that the test is whether the individual is
forced "to be an instrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological
point of view he finds unacceptable." But, once again, these are merely
conclusory words, barren of analysis. For example, were New Hampshire to
erect a multitude of billboards, each proclaiming "Live Free or Die," and tax all
citizens for the cost of erection and maintenance, clearly the message would be
"fostered" by the individual citizen-taxpayers, and, just as clearly, those
individuals would be "instruments" in that communication. Certainly, however,
that case would not fall within the ambit of Barnette. In that case, as in this
case, there is no affirmation of belief. For First Amendment principles to be
implicated, the State must place the citizen in the position of either apparently
or actually "asserting as true" the message. This was the focus of Barnette, and
clearly distinguishes this case from that one.
In holding that the New Hampshire statute does not run afoul of our holding in
Barnette, the New Hampshire Supreme Court aptly articulated why there is no
required affirmation of belief in this case:
The defendants' membership in a class of persons required to display plates
bearing the State motto carries no implication, and is subject to no requirement,
that they endorse that motto or profess to adopt it as matter of belief.

As found by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in Hoskin, there is nothing in
state law which precludes appellees from displaying their disagreement with the
state motto as long as the methods used do not obscure the license plates.
Thus appellees could place on their bumper a conspicuous bumper sticker
explaining in no uncertain terms that they do not profess the motto "Live Free
or Die," and that they violently disagree with the connotations of that motto.
Since any implication that they affirm the motto can be so easily displaced, I
cannot agree that the state statutory system for motor vehicle identification and
tourist promotion may be invalidated under the fiction that appellees are
unconstitutionally forced to affirm, or profess belief in, the state motto.
The logic of the Court's opinion leads to startling, and, I believe, totally
unacceptable, results. For example, the mottoes "In God We Trust" and "E
Pluribus Unum" appear on the coin and currency of the United States. I cannot
imagine that the statutes, proscribing defacement of United States currency
impinge upon the First Amendment rights of an atheist. The fact that an atheist
Robson

383

The First Amendment

carries and uses United States currency does not, in any meaningful sense,
convey any affirmation of belief on his part in the motto "In God We Trust."
Similarly, there is no affirmation of belief involved in the display of state license
tags upon the private automobiles involved here.

Notes	  	  
1.
The Court in Barnette explicitly overruled Minersville School District
v. Gobitis, decided only three years earlier. Note that Justice Frankfurter
wrote the opinion for the Court in Gobitis; the only dissenting opinion
was by Justice Harlan Stone, who would be elevated to Chief Justice by
FDR in 1941. What traces of the historical events in 1940 – 1943 are
evident in the Barnette opinions?
2.
George Maynard eventually left New Hampshire, moving to
Connecticut, and covering up the license plate motto “The Constitution
State.” He later left the Jehovah’s Witnesses as well, although he
continued to resist secular government. As for his representation by the
ACLU, he reportedly stated that “they did right by me in my case and I
still appreciate that.” He objected, however, to ACLU involvement in “bad
things, such as protecting pornography and homosexuality — things that
conflict with the teachings of the Bible.” See David Hudson, George

Are all license plates subject to a First Amendment compelled

the sky. The plate also contained the words “Native America” to which
there was no objection. What result? See Cressman v. Thompson, 2014

REHNQUIST, C.J., DELIVERED THE OPINION FOR A UNANIMOUS COURT.

Robson

384

The First Amendment

Petitioners, members of respondent State Bar of California, sued that body,
claiming its use of their membership dues to finance certain ideological or
political activities to which they were opposed violated their rights under the
First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court of
California rejected this challenge on the grounds that the State Bar is a state
agency and, as such, may use the dues for any purpose within its broad
statutory authority. We agree that lawyers admitted to practice in the State may
be required to join and pay dues to the State Bar, but disagree as to the scope
of permissible dues-financed activities in which the State Bar may engage.
The State Bar is an organization created under California law to regulate the
State's legal profession. It is an entity commonly referred to as an "integrated
bar" - an association of attorneys in which membership and dues are required
as a condition of practicing law in a State. Respondent's broad statutory
mission is to "promote `the improvement of the administration of justice.'" The
association performs a variety of functions such as "examining applicants for
admission, formulating rules of professional conduct, disciplining members for
misconduct, preventing unlawful practice of the law, and engaging in study and
recommendation of changes in procedural law and improvement of the
administration of justice." Respondent also engages in a number of other
activities which are the subject of the dispute in this case. "[T]he State Bar for
many years has lobbied the Legislature and other governmental agencies, filed
amicus curiae briefs in pending cases, held an annual conference of delegates
at which issues of current interest are debated and resolutions approved, and
engaged in a variety of education programs." These activities are financed
principally through the use of membership dues.
Petitioners, 21 members of the State Bar, sued in state court claiming that
through these activities respondent expends mandatory dues payments to
advance political and ideological causes to which they do not subscribe.
Asserting that their compelled financial support of such activities violates their
First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association,
petitioners requested, inter alia, an injunction restraining respondent from
using mandatory bar dues or the name of the State Bar to advance political and
ideological causes or beliefs. ***
In Abood v. Detroit Board of Education (1977), the Court confronted the issue
whether, consistent with the First Amendment, agency-shop dues of nonunion
public employees could be used to support political and ideological causes of
the union which were unrelated to collective-bargaining activities. We held that
while the Constitution did not prohibit a union from spending "funds for the
expression of political views . . . or toward the advancement of other ideological
causes not germane to its duties as collective-bargaining representative," the
Constitution did require that such expenditures be "financed from charges,
dues, or assessments paid by employees who [did] not object to advancing those
ideas and who [were] not coerced into doing so against their will by the threat of
loss of governmental employment." The Court noted that just as prohibitions
on making contributions to organizations for political purposes implicate
fundamental First Amendment concerns, see Buckley v. Valeo (1976),

Robson

385

The First Amendment

"compelled . . . contributions for political purposes works no less an
infringement of . . . constitutional rights." The Court acknowledged Thomas
Jefferson's view that "`to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for
the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.'" ***
There is, by contrast [to the California Supreme Court’s holding], a substantial
analogy between the relationship of the State Bar and its members, on the one
hand, and the relationship of employee unions and their members, on the
other. The reason behind the legislative enactment of "agency-shop" laws is to
prevent "free riders" - those who receive the benefit of union negotiation with
their employers, but who do not choose to join the union and pay dues - from
avoiding their fair share of the cost of a process from which they benefit. The
members of the State Bar concededly do not benefit as directly from its
activities as do employees from union negotiations with management, but the
position of the organized bars has generally been that they prefer a large
measure of self-regulation to regulation conducted by a government body which
has little or no connection with the profession. The plan established by
California for the regulation of the profession is for recommendations as to
admission to practice, the disciplining of lawyers, codes of conduct, and the like
to be made to the courts or the legislature by the organized bar. It is entirely
appropriate that all of the lawyers who derive benefit from the unique status of
being among those admitted to practice before the courts should be called upon
to pay a fair share of the cost of the professional involvement in this effort.
But the very specialized characteristics of the State Bar of California discussed
above served to distinguish it from the role of the typical government official or
agency. Government officials are expected as a part of the democratic process to
represent and to espouse the views of a majority of their constituents. With
countless advocates outside of the government seeking to influence its policy, it
would be ironic if those charged with making governmental decisions were not
free to speak for themselves in the process. If every citizen were to have a right
to insist that no one paid by public funds express a view with which he
disagreed, debate over issues of great concern to the public would be limited to
those in the private sector, and the process of government as we know it
radically transformed.
The State Bar of California was created, not to participate in the general
government of the State, but to provide specialized professional advice to those
with the ultimate responsibility of governing the legal profession. Its members
and officers are such not because they are citizens or voters, but because they
are lawyers. We think that these differences between the State Bar, on the one
hand, and traditional government agencies and officials, on the other hand,
render unavailing respondent's argument that it is not subject to the same
constitutional rule with respect to the use of compulsory dues as are labor
unions representing public and private employees.
Respondent would further distinguish the two situations on the grounds that
the compelled association in the context of labor unions serves only a private
economic interest in collective bargaining, while the State Bar serves more

Robson

386

The First Amendment

substantial public interests. But legislative recognition that the agency-shop
arrangements serve vital national interests in preserving industrial peace,
indicates that such arrangements serve substantial public interests as well. We
are not possessed of any scales which would enable us to determine that the
one outweighs the other sufficiently to produce a different result here.
Abood held that a union could not expend a dissenting individual's dues for
ideological activities not "germane" to the purpose for which compelled
association was justified: collective bargaining. Here the compelled association
and integrated bar are justified by the State's interest in regulating the legal
profession and improving the quality of legal services. The State Bar may
therefore constitutionally fund activities germane to those goals out of the
mandatory dues of all members. It may not, however, in such manner fund
activities of an ideological nature which fall outside of those areas of activity.
The difficult question, of course, is to define the latter class of activities.
Petitioners assert that the State Bar has engaged in, inter alia, lobbying for or
against state legislation (1) prohibiting state and local agency employers from
requiring employees to take polygraph tests; (2) prohibiting possession of
armorpiercing handgun ammunition; (3) creating an unlimited right of action to
sue anybody causing air pollution; and (4) requesting Congress to refrain from
enacting a guest-worker program or from permitting the importation of workers
from other countries. Petitioners' complaint also alleges that the conference of
delegates funded and sponsored by the State Bar endorsed a gun control
initiative, disapproved statements of a United States senatorial candidate
regarding court review of a victim's bill of rights, endorsed a nuclear weapons
freeze initiative, and opposed federal legislation limiting federal-court
jurisdiction over abortions, public school prayer, and busing.
Precisely where the line falls between those State Bar activities in which the
officials and members of the Bar are acting essentially as professional advisers
to those ultimately charged with the regulation of the legal profession, on the
one hand, and those activities having political or ideological coloration which
are not reasonably related to the advancement of such goals, on the other, will
not always be easy to discern. But the extreme ends of the spectrum are clear:
Compulsory dues may not be expended to endorse or advance a gun control or
nuclear weapons freeze initiative; at the other end of the spectrum petitioners
have no valid constitutional objection to their compulsory dues being spent for
activities connected with disciplining members of the Bar or proposing ethical
codes for the profession.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is reversed. ***

529 U.S. 217 (2000)

KENNEDY, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH REHNQUIST, C. J., AND
O'CONNOR, SCALIA, THOMAS, AND GINSBURG, JJ., JOINED. SOUTER, J., FILED AN OPINION
CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT, IN WHICH STEVENS AND BREYER, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
For the second time in recent years we consider constitutional questions arising
from a program designed to facilitate extracurricular student speech at a public
university. Respondents are a group of students at the University of Wisconsin.
They brought a First Amendment challenge to a mandatory student activity fee
imposed by petitioner Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin and used
in part by the University to support student organizations engaging in political
or ideological speech. Respondents object to the speech and expression of some
of the student organizations. Relying upon our precedents which protect
members of unions and bar associations from being required to pay fees used
for speech the members find objectionable, both the District Court and the
Court of Appeals invalidated the University's student fee program. The
University contends that its mandatory student activity fee and the speech
which it supports are appropriate to further its educational mission.
We reverse. The First Amendment permits a public university to charge its
students an activity fee used to fund a program to facilitate extracurricular
student speech if the program is viewpoint neutral. We do not sustain, however,
the student referendum mechanism of the University's program, which appears
to permit the exaction of fees in violation of the viewpoint neutrality principle.
As to that aspect of the program, we remand for further proceedings.
It seems that since its founding the University has required full-time students
enrolled at its Madison campus to pay a nonrefundable activity fee. For the
1995-1996 academic year, when this suit was commenced, the activity fee
amounted to $331.50 per year. The fee is segregated from the University's
tuition charge. Once collected, the activity fees are deposited by the University
into the accounts of the State of Wisconsin. The fees are drawn upon by the
University to support various campus services and extracurricular student
activities. In the University's view, the activity fees "enhance the educational
experience" of its students by "promot[ing] extracurricular activities,"
"stimulating advocacy and debate on diverse points of view," enabling
"participa[tion] in political activity," "promot[ing] student participa[tion] in
campus administrative activity," and providing "opportunities to develop social
skills," all consistent with the University's mission.
The board of regents classifies the segregated fee into allocable and
nonallocable portions. The nonallocable portion approximates 80% of the total
fee and covers expenses such as student health services, intramural sports,
debt service, and the upkeep and operations of the student union facilities.
Robson

388

The First Amendment

Respondents did not challenge the purposes to which the University commits
the nonallocable portion of the segregated fee.
The allocable portion of the fee supports extracurricular endeavors pursued by
the University's registered student organizations or RSO's. To qualify for RSO
status students must organize as a not-for-profit group, limit membership
primarily to students, and agree to undertake activities related to student life
on campus. During the 1995-1996 school year, 623 groups had RSO status on
the Madison campus. To name but a few, RSO's included the Future Financial
Gurus of America; the International Socialist Organization; the College
Democrats; the College Republicans; and the American Civil Liberties Union
Campus Chapter. As one would expect, the expressive activities undertaken by
RSO's are diverse in range and content, from displaying posters and circulating
newsletters throughout the campus, to hosting campus debates and guest
speakers, and to what can best be described as political lobbying.
RSO's may obtain a portion of the allocable fees in one of three ways. Most do
so by seeking funding from the Student Government Activity Fund (SGAF),
administered by the ASM. SGAF moneys may be issued to support an RSO's
operations and events, as well as travel expenses "central to the purpose of the
organization." As an alternative, an RSO can apply for funding from the General
Student Services Fund (GSSF), administered through the ASM's finance
committee. During the 1995-1996 academic year, 15 RSO's received GSSF
funding. These RSO's included a campus tutoring center, the student radio
station, a student environmental group, a gay and bisexual student center, a
community legal office, an AIDS support network, a campus women's center,
and the Wisconsin Student Public Interest Research Group (WISPIRG). The
University acknowledges that, in addition to providing campus services ( e.g.,
tutoring and counseling), the GSSF-funded RSO's engage in political and
ideological expression.
The GSSF, as well as the SGAF, consists of moneys originating in the allocable
portion of the mandatory fee. The parties have stipulated that, with respect to
SGAF and GSSF funding, "[t]he process for reviewing and approving allocations
for funding is administered in a viewpoint-neutral fashion," and that the
University does not use the fee program for "advocating a particular point of
view."
A student referendum provides a third means for an RSO to obtain funding.
While the record is sparse on this feature of the University's program, the
parties inform us that the student body can vote either to approve or to
disapprove an assessment for a particular RSO. One referendum resulted in an
allocation of $45,000 to WISPIRG during the 1995-1996 academic year. At oral
argument, counsel for the University acknowledged that a referendum could
also operate to defund an RSO or to veto a funding decision of the ASM. In
October 1996, for example, the student body voted to terminate funding to a
national student organization to which the University belonged. Both parties
confirmed at oral argument that their stipulation regarding the program's
viewpoint neutrality does not extend to the referendum process. ***

The First Amendment

II.
It is inevitable that government will adopt and pursue programs and policies
within its constitutional powers but which nevertheless are contrary to the
profound beliefs and sincere convictions of some of its citizens. The
government, as a general rule, may support valid programs and policies by
taxes or other exactions binding on protesting parties. Within this broader
principle it seems inevitable that funds raised by the government will be spent
for speech and other expression to advocate and defend its own policies. The
case we decide here, however, does not raise the issue of the government's
right, or, to be more specific, the state-controlled University's right, to use its
own funds to advance a particular message. The University's whole justification
for fostering the challenged expression is that it springs from the initiative of
the students, who alone give it purpose and content in the course of their
extracurricular endeavors.
The University of Wisconsin exacts the fee at issue for the sole purpose of
facilitating the free and open exchange of ideas by, and among, its students. We
conclude the objecting students may insist upon certain safeguards with
respect to the expressive activities which they are required to support. Our
public forum cases are instructive here by close analogy. This is true even
though the student activities fund is not a public forum in the traditional sense
of the term and despite the circumstance that those cases most often involve a
demand for access, not a claim to be exempt from supporting speech. The
standard of viewpoint neutrality found in the public forum cases provides the
standard we find controlling. We decide that the viewpoint neutrality
requirement of the University program is in general sufficient to protect the
rights of the objecting students. The student referendum aspect of the program
for funding speech and expressive activities, however, appears to be
inconsistent with the viewpoint neutrality requirement.
We must begin by recognizing that the complaining students are being required
to pay fees which are subsidies for speech they find objectionable, even
offensive. The Abood and Keller cases, then, provide the beginning point for our
analysis. While those precedents identify the interests of the protesting
students, the means of implementing First Amendment protections adopted in
those decisions are neither applicable nor workable in the context of
extracurricular student speech at a university.
*** If the University conditions the opportunity to receive a college education, an
opportunity comparable in importance to joining a labor union or bar
association, on an agreement to support objectionable, extracurricular
expression by other students, the rights acknowledged in Abood and Keller
become implicated. It infringes on the speech and beliefs of the individual to be
required, by this mandatory student activity fee program, to pay subsidies for
the objectionable speech of others without any recognition of the State's
corresponding duty to him or her. Yet recognition must be given as well to the
important and substantial purposes of the University, which seeks to facilitate
a wide range of speech.

Robson

390

The First Amendment

In Abood and Keller the constitutional rule took the form of limiting the required
subsidy to speech germane to the purposes of the union or bar association. The
standard of germane speech as applied to student speech at a university is
unworkable, however, and gives insufficient protection both to the objecting
students and to the University program itself. *** To insist upon asking what
speech is germane would be contrary to the very goal the University seeks to
pursue. It is not for the Court to say what is or is not germane to the ideas to be
pursued in an institution of higher learning.
Just as the vast extent of permitted expression makes the test of germane
speech inappropriate for intervention, so too does it underscore the high
potential for intrusion on the First Amendment rights of the objecting students.
It is all but inevitable that the fees will result in subsidies to speech which some
students find objectionable and offensive to their personal beliefs. If the
standard of germane speech is inapplicable, then, it might be argued the
remedy is to allow each student to list those causes which he or she will or will
not support. If a university decided that its students' First Amendment interests
were better protected by some type of optional or refund system it would be free
to do so. We decline to impose a system of that sort as a constitutional
requirement, however. The restriction could be so disruptive and expensive that
the program to support extracurricular speech would be ineffective. The First
Amendment does not require the University to put the program at risk.
The University may determine that its mission is well served if students have
the means to engage in dynamic discussions of philosophical, religious,
scientific, social, and political subjects in their extracurricular campus life
outside the lecture hall. If the University reaches this conclusion, it is entitled
to impose a mandatory fee to sustain an open dialogue to these ends.
The University must provide some protection to its students' First Amendment
interests, however. The proper measure, and the principal standard of
protection for objecting students, we conclude, is the requirement of viewpoint
neutrality in the allocation of funding support. *** When a university requires
its students to pay fees to support the extracurricular speech of other students,
all in the interest of open discussion, it may not prefer some viewpoints to
others. There is symmetry then in our holding here and in Rosenberger:
Viewpoint neutrality is the justification for requiring the student to pay the fee
in the first instance and for ensuring the integrity of the program's operation
once the funds have been collected. We conclude that the University of
Wisconsin may sustain the extracurricular dimensions of its programs by using
mandatory student fees with viewpoint neutrality as the operational principle.
The parties have stipulated that the program the University has developed to
stimulate extracurricular student expression respects the principle of viewpoint
neutrality. If the stipulation is to continue to control the case, the University's
program in its basic structure must be found consistent with the First
Amendment.

Robson

391

The First Amendment

Our decision ought not to be taken to imply that in other instances the
University, its agents or employees, or--of particular importance--its faculty, are
subject to the First Amendment analysis which controls in this case. Where the
University speaks, either in its own name through its regents or officers, or in
myriad other ways through its diverse faculties, the analysis likely would be
altogether different. The Court has not held, or suggested, that when the
government speaks the rules we have discussed come into play.
III
It remains to discuss the referendum aspect of the University's program. While
the record is not well developed on the point, it appears that by majority vote of
the student body a given RSO may be funded or defunded. It is unclear to us
what protection, if any, there is for viewpoint neutrality in this part of the
process. To the extent the referendum substitutes majority determinations for
viewpoint neutrality it would undermine the constitutional protection the
program requires. The whole theory of viewpoint neutrality is that minority
views are treated with the same respect as are majority views. Access to a
public forum, for instance, does not depend upon majoritarian consent. That
principle is controlling here. A remand is necessary and appropriate to resolve
this point; and the case in all events must be reexamined in light of the
principles we have discussed.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.***

JUSTICE SCALIA DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
For the third time in eight years, we consider whether a federal program that
finances generic advertising to promote an agricultural product violates the
First Amendment. In these cases, unlike the previous two, the dispositive
question is whether the generic advertising at issue is the Government’s own
speech and therefore is exempt from First Amendment scrutiny.

The First Amendment

products,” using funds raised by an assessment on cattle sales and
importation. The statute directs the Secretary of Agriculture to implement this
policy by issuing a Beef Promotion and Research Order (Beef Order or Order),
and specifies four key terms it must contain: The Secretary is to appoint a
Cattlemen’s Beef Promotion and Research Board (Beef Board or Board), whose
members are to be a geographically representative group of beef producers and
importers, nominated by trade associations. The Beef Board is to convene an
Operating Committee, composed of 10 Beef Board members and 10
representatives named by a federation of state beef councils. The Secretary is to
impose a $1-per-head assessment (or “checkoff”) on all sales or importation of
cattle and a comparable assessment on imported beef products. And the
assessment is to be used to fund beef-related projects, including promotional
campaigns, designed by the Operating Committee and approved by the
Secretary.
The Secretary promulgated the Beef Order with the specified terms. The
assessment is collected primarily by state beef councils, which then forward the
proceeds to the Beef Board. The Operating Committee proposes projects to be
funded by the checkoff, including promotion and research. The Secretary or his
designee approves each project and, in the case of promotional materials, the
content of each communication. *** Many promotional messages funded by the
checkoff (though not all) bear the attribution “Funded by America’s Beef
Producers.” Most print and television messages also bear a Beef Board logo,
usually a check-mark with the word “BEEF.”
II
We have sustained First Amendment challenges to allegedly compelled
expression in two categories of cases: true “compelled speech” cases, in which
an individual is obliged personally to express a message he disagrees with,
imposed by the government; and “compelled subsidy” cases, in which an
individual is required by the government to subsidize a message he disagrees
with, expressed by a private entity. We have not heretofore considered the First
Amendment consequences of government-compelled subsidy of the
government’s own speech.
We first invalidated an outright compulsion of speech in West Virginia Bd. of Ed.
v. Barnette (1943). The State required every schoolchild to recite the Pledge of
Allegiance while saluting the American flag, on pain of expulsion from the
public schools. We held that the First Amendment does not “le[ave] it open to
public authorities to compel [a person] to utter” a message with which he does
not agree. Likewise, in Wooley v. Maynard (1977), we held that requiring a New
Hampshire couple to bear the State’s motto, “Live Free or Die,” on their cars’
license plates was an impermissible compulsion of expression. Obliging people
to “use their private property as a ‘mobile billboard’ for the State’s ideological
message” amounted to impermissible compelled expression.
The reasoning of these compelled-speech cases has been carried over to certain
instances in which individuals are compelled not to speak, but to subsidize a
private message with which they disagree. Thus, although we have upheld
state-imposed requirements that lawyers be members of the state bar and pay
its annual dues, and that public- school teachers either join the labor union

Robson

393

The First Amendment

representing their “shop” or pay “service fees” equal to the union dues, we have
invalidated the use of the compulsory fees to fund speech on political matters.
See Keller v. State Bar of Cal. (1990); Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. (1977). Bar or
union speech with such content, we held, was not germane to the regulatory
interests that justified compelled membership, and accordingly, making those
who disagreed with it pay for it violated the First Amendment.
These latter cases led us to sustain a compelled-subsidy challenge to an
assessment very similar to the beef check-off, imposed to fund mushroom
advertising. Deciding the case on the assumption that the advertising was
private speech, not government speech, we concluded that Abood and Keller
were controlling. As in those cases, mushroom producers were obliged by “law
or necessity” to pay the checkoff; although Abood and Keller would permit the
mandatory fee if it were “germane” to a “broader regulatory scheme,” in United
States v. United Foods (2001) the only regulatory purpose was the funding of the
advertising.
In all of the cases invalidating exactions to subsidize speech, the speech was, or
was presumed to be, that of an entity other than the government itself. *** Our
compelled-subsidy cases have consistently respected the principle that
“[c]ompelled support of a private association is fundamentally different from
compelled support of government.” Abood (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).
“Compelled support of government”—even those programs of government one
does not approve—is of course perfectly constitutional, as every taxpayer must
attest. And some government programs involve, or entirely consist of,
advocating a position. “The government, as a general rule, may support valid
programs and policies by taxes or other exactions binding on protesting parties.
Within this broader principle it seems inevitable that funds raised by the
government will be spent for speech and other expression to advocate and
defend its own policies.” Southworth. We have generally assumed, though not
yet squarely held, that compelled funding of government speech does not alone
raise First Amendment concerns.***
III
Respondents do not seriously dispute these principles, nor do they contend
that, as a general matter, their First Amendment challenge requires them to
show only that their checkoff dollars pay for speech with which they disagree.
Rather, they assert that the challenged promotional campaigns differ
dispositively from the type of government speech that, our cases suggest, is not
susceptible to First Amendment challenge. They point to the role of the Beef
Board and its Operating Committee in designing the promotional campaigns,
and to the use of a mandatory assessment on beef producers to fund the
advertising. We consider each in turn.
A
The Secretary of Agriculture does not write ad copy himself. Rather, the Beef
Board’s promotional campaigns are designed by the Beef Board’s Operating
Committee, only half of whose members are Beef Board members appointed by
the Secretary. (All members of the Operating Committee are subject to removal
by the Secretary.) Respondents contend that speech whose content is effectively
controlled by a nongovernmental entity—the Operating Committee—cannot be

Robson

394

The First Amendment

considered “government speech.” We need not address this contention, because
we reject its premise: The message of the promotional campaigns is effectively
controlled by the Federal Government itself.
Moreover, the record demonstrates that the Secretary exercises final approval
authority over every word used in every promotional campaign. All proposed
promotional messages are reviewed by Department officials both for substance
and for wording, and some proposals are rejected or rewritten by the
Department. Nor is the Secretary’s role limited to final approval or rejection:
officials of the Department also attend and participate in the open meetings at
which proposals are developed.
This degree of governmental control over the message funded by the checkoff
distinguishes these cases from Keller. *** When, as here, the government sets
the overall message to be communicated and approves every word that is
disseminated, it is not precluded from relying on the government-speech
doctrine merely because it solicits assistance from nongovernmental sources in
developing specific messages.
B
Respondents also contend that the beef program does not qualify as
“government speech” because it is funded by a targeted assessment on beef
producers, rather than by general revenues. This funding mechanism, they
argue, has two relevant effects: it gives control over the beef program not to
politically accountable legislators, but to a narrow interest group that will pay
no heed to respondents’ dissenting views, and it creates the perception that the
advertisements speak for beef producers such as respondents.
We reject the first point. The compelled-subsidy analysis is altogether
unaffected by whether the funds for the promotions are raised by general taxes
or through a targeted assessment. Citizens may challenge compelled support of
private speech, but have no First Amendment right not to fund government
speech. And that is no less true when the funding is achieved through targeted
assessments devoted exclusively to the program to which the assessed citizens
object. ***
Here, the beef advertisements are subject to political safeguards more than
adequate to set them apart from private messages. The program is authorized
and the basic message prescribed by federal statute, and specific requirements
for the promotions’ content are imposed by federal regulations promulgated
after notice and comment. The Secretary of Agriculture, a politically
accountable official, oversees the program, appoints and dismisses the key
personnel, and retains absolute veto power over the advertisements’ content,
right down to the wording. And Congress, of course, retains oversight authority,
not to mention the ability to reform the program at any time. No more is
required.
As to the second point, respondents’ argument proceeds as follows: They
contend that crediting the advertising to “America’s Beef Producers”
impermissibly uses not only their money but also their seeming endorsement to
pro- mote a message with which they do not agree. Communications cannot be
“government speech,” they argue, if they are attributed to someone other than

Robson

395

The First Amendment

the government; and the person to whom they are attributed, when he is, by
compulsory funding, made the unwilling instrument of communication, may
raise a First Amendment objection.
We need not determine the validity of this argument— which relates to
compelled speech rather than compelled subsidy—with regard to respondents’
facial challenge. Since neither the Beef Act nor the Beef Order requires
attribution, neither can be the cause of any possible First Amendment harm.
Whether the individual respondents who are beef producers would be
associated with speech labeled as coming from “America’s Beef Producers” is a
question on which the trial record is altogether silent. We have only the funding
tagline itself, a trademarked term that, standing alone, is not sufficiently
specific to convince a reasonable factfinder that any particular beef producer, or
all beef producers, would be tarred with the content of each trademarked ad.
We therefore conclude that on the record before us an as-applied First
Amendment challenge to the individual advertisements affords no basis on
which to sustain the Eighth Circuit’s judgment, even in part.

KENNEDY, AND THOMAS, JOINED. KAGAN, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH GINSBURG,
BREYER, AND SOTOMAYOR, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE ALITO DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
This case presents the question whether the First Amendment permits a State
to compel personal care providers to subsidize speech on matters of public
concern by a union that they do not wish to join or support. We hold that it
does not, and we therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
I
A
Millions of Americans, due to age, illness, or injury, are unable to live in their
own homes without assistance and are unable to afford the expense of in-home
care. In order to prevent these individuals from having to enter a nursing home
or other facility, the federal Medicaid program funds state-run programs that
provide in-home services to individuals whose conditions would otherwise
require institutionalization. A State that adopts such a program receives federal
funds to compensate persons who attend to the daily needs of individuals
needing in-home care. Almost every State has established such a program.
One of those States is Illinois, which has created the Illinois Department of
Human Services Home Services Program, known colloquially as the state
"Rehabilitation
Program."
"[D]esigned
to
prevent
the
unnecessary
institutionalization of individuals who may instead be satisfactorily maintained
at home at a lesser cost to the State," the Rehabilitation Program allows

Robson

396

The First Amendment

participants to hire a "personal assistant" who provides homecare services
tailored to the individual's needs. Many of these personal assistants are
relatives of the person receiving care, and some of them provide care in their
own homes.
Illinois law establishes an employer-employee relationship between the person
receiving the care and the person providing it. The law states explicitly that the
person receiving home care—the "customer"—"shall be the employer of the
[personal assistant]." (emphasis added). A "personal assistant" is defined as "an
individual employed by the customer to provide . . . varied services that have
been approved by the customer's physician," (emphasis added), and the law
makes clear that Illinois "shall not have control or input in the employment
relationship between the customer and the personal assistants."
Other provisions of the law emphasize the customer's employer status. The
customer "is responsible for controlling all aspects of the employment
relationship between the customer and the [personal assistant (or PA)],
including, without limitation, locating and hiring the PA, training the PA,
directing, evaluating and otherwise supervising the work performed by the
personal assistant, imposing . . . disciplinary action against the PA, and
terminating the employment relationship between the customer and the PA."
***In general, the customer "has complete discretion in which Personal
Assistant he/she wishes to hire." §684.20(b).
A customer also controls the contents of the document, the Service Plan, that
lists the services that the customer will receive. No Service Plan may take effect
without the approval of both the customer and the customer's physician.
Service Plans are highly individualized. The Illinois State Labor Relations Board
noted in 1985 that "[t]here is no typical employment arrangement here, public
or otherwise; rather, there simply exists an arrangement whereby the state of
Illinois pays individuals . . . to work under the direction and control of private
third parties."
While customers exercise predominant control over their employment
relationship with personal assistants, the State, subsidized by the federal
Medicaid program, pays the personal assistants' salaries. The amount paid
varies depending on the services provided, but as a general matter, it
"corresponds to the amount the State would expect to pay for the nursing care
component of institutionalization if the individual chose institutionalization."
Other than providing compensation, the State's role is comparatively small. The
State sets some basic threshold qualifications for employment.
B
Section 6 of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (PLRA) authorizes state
employees to join labor unions and to bargain collectively on the terms and
conditions of employment. This law applies to "[e]mployees of the State and any

Robson

397

The First Amendment

political subdivision of the State," subject to certain exceptions, and it provides
for a union to be recognized if it is "designated by the [Public Labor Relations]
Board as the representative of the majority of public employees in an
appropriate unit . . . ."
The PLRA contains an agency-fee provision, i.e., a provision under which
members of a bargaining unit who do not wish to join the union are
nevertheless required to pay a fee to the union. Labeled a "fair share" provision,
this section of the PLRA provides: "When a collective bargaining agreement is
entered into with an exclusive representative, it may include in the agreement a
provision requiring employees covered by the agreement who are not members
of the organization to pay their proportionate share of the costs of the collectivebargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting
wages, hours and conditions of employment." This payment is "deducted by the
employer from the earnings of the nonmember employees and paid to the
employee organization."
In the 1980's, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) petitioned the
Illinois Labor Relations Board for permission to represent personal assistants
employed by customers in the Rehabilitation Program, but the board rebuffed
this effort. The board concluded that "it is clear . . . that [Illinois] does not
exercise the type of control over the petitioned-for employees necessary to be
considered, in the collective bargaining context envisioned by the [PLRA], their
'employer' or, at least, their sole employer."
In March 2003, however, Illinois' newly elected Governor, Rod Blagojevich,
circumvented this decision by issuing Executive Order 2003-08. The order
noted the Illinois Labor Relations Board decision but nevertheless called for
state recognition of a union as the personal assistants' exclusive representative
for the purpose of collective bargaining with the State. This was necessary, Gov.
Blagojevich declared, so that the State could "receive feedback from the
personal assistants in order to effectively and efficiently deliver home services."
Without such representation, the Governor proclaimed, personal assistants
"cannot effectively voice their concerns about the organization of the Home
Services program, their role in the program, or the terms and conditions of their
employment under the Program."
Several months later, the Illinois Legislature codified that executive order by
amending the PLRA. While acknowledging "the right of the persons receiving
services . . . to hire and fire personal assistants or supervise them," the Act
declared personal assistants to be "public employees" of the State of Illinois—
but "[s]olely for the purposes of coverage under the Illinois Public Labor
Relations Act." The statute emphasized that personal assistants are not state
employees for any other purpose, "including but not limited to, purposes of
vicarious liability in tort and purposes of statutory retirement or health
insurance benefits."
Following a vote, SEIU Healthcare Illinois & Indiana (SEIU-HII) was designated
as the personal assistants' exclusive representative for purposes of collective

Robson

398

The First Amendment

bargaining. The union and the State subsequently entered into collectivebargaining agreements that require all personal assistants who are not union
members to pay a "fair share" of the union dues. These payments are deducted
directly from the personal assistants' Medicaid payments. The record in this
case shows that each year, personal assistants in Illinois pay SEIU-HII more
than $3.6 million in fees.
C
Three of the petitioners in the case now before us— Theresa Riffey, Susan
Watts, and Stephanie YencerPrice—are personal assistants under the
Rehabilitation Program. They all provide in-home services to family members or
other individuals suffering from disabilities. *** Susan Watts, for example,
serves as personal assistant for her daughter, who requires constant care due
to quadriplegic cerebral palsy and other conditions. In 2010, these petitioners
filed a putative class action on behalf of all Rehabilitation Program personal
assistants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois. Their complaint, which named the Governor and the union as
defendants, sought an injunction against enforcement of the fair-share
provision and a declaration that the Illinois PLRA violates the First Amendment
insofar as it requires personal assistants to pay a fee to a union that they do
not wish to support.
The District Court dismissed their claims with prejudice, and the Seventh
Circuit affirmed in relevant part, concluding that the case was controlled by
this Court's decision in Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. (1977). The Seventh Circuit
held that Illinois and the customers who receive in-home care are "joint
employers" of the personal assistants, and the court stated that it had "no
difficulty concluding that the State employs personal assistants within the
meaning of Abood."
Petitioners sought certiorari. Their petition pointed out that other States were
following Illinois' lead by enacting laws or issuing executive orders that deem
personal assistants to be state employees for the purpose of unionization and
the assessment of fair-share fees. Petitioners also noted that Illinois has
enacted a law that deems "individual maintenance home health workers"—a
category that includes registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and certain
therapists who work in private homes—to be "public employees" for similar
purposes.
In light of the important First Amendment questions these laws raise, we
granted certiorari.
II
In upholding the constitutionality of the Illinois law, the Seventh Circuit relied
on this Court's decision in Abood, which held that state employees who choose
not to join a public-sector union may nevertheless be compelled to pay an
agency fee to support union work that is related to the collective-bargaining

The First Amendment

process. Two Terms ago, in Knox v. Service Employees (2012), we pointed out
that Abood is "something of an anomaly." "'The primary purpose' of permitting
unions to collect fees from non-members," we noted, "is 'to prevent
nonmembers from free-riding on the union's efforts, sharing the employment
benefits obtained by the union's collective bargaining without sharing the costs
incurred.'" But "[s]uch free-rider arguments . . . are generally insufficient to
overcome First Amendment objections." For this reason, Abood stands out, but
the State of Illinois now asks us to sanction what amounts to a very significant
expansion of Abood—so that it applies, not just to full-fledged public employees,
but also to others who are deemed to be public employees solely for the purpose
of unionization and the collection of an agency fee. ***
D
The Abood Court's analysis is questionable on several grounds. Some of these
were noted or apparent at or before the time of the decision, but several have
become more evident and troubling in the years since then. ***
Abood failed to appreciate the difference between the core union speech
involuntarily subsidized by dissenting public-sector employees and the core
union speech involuntarily funded by their counterparts in the private sector.
In the public sector, core issues such as wages, pensions, and benefits are
important political issues, but that is generally not so in the private sector. In
the years since Abood, as state and local expenditures on employee wages and
benefits have mushroomed, the importance of the difference between bargaining
in the public and private sectors has been driven home.
Recent experience has borne out this concern. See DiSalvo, The Trouble with
Public Sector Unions, National Affairs No. 5, p. 15 (2010) ("In Illinois, for
example, public-sector unions have helped create a situation in which the
state's pension funds report a liability of more than $100 billion, at least 50% of
it unfunded").
Abood failed to appreciate the conceptual difficulty of distinguishing in publicsector cases between union expenditures that are made for collective-bargaining
purposes and those that are made to achieve political ends. In the private
sector, the line is easier to see. Collective bargaining concerns the union's
dealings with the employer; political advocacy and lobbying are directed at the
government. But in the public sector, both collective-bargaining and political
advocacy and lobbying are directed at the government.
Abood does not seem to have anticipated the magnitude of the practical
administrative problems that would result in attempting to classify publicsector union expenditures as either "chargeable" (in Abood's terms,
expenditures for "collective-bargaining, contract administration, and grievanceadjustment purposes") or nonchargeable (i.e., expenditures for political or
ideological purposes). In the years since Abood, the Court has struggled
repeatedly with this issue. In Lehnert [v. Ferris Faculty Assn .(1991)], the Court
held that "chargeable activities must (1) be 'germane' to collective-bargaining

Robson

400

The First Amendment

activity; (2) be justified by the government's vital policy interest in labor peace
and avoiding 'free riders'; and (3) not significantly add to the burdening of free
speech that is inherent in the allowance of an agency or union shop." But as
noted in JUSTICE SCALIA's dissent in that case, "each one of the three 'prongs'
of the test involves a substantial judgment call (What is 'germane'? What is
'justified'? What is a 'significant' additional burden)."
Abood likewise did not foresee the practical problems that would face objecting
nonmembers. Employees who suspect that a union has improperly put certain
expenses in the "germane" category must bear a heavy burden if they wish to
challenge the union's actions. ***
Finally, a critical pillar of the Abood Court's analysis rests on an unsupported
empirical assumption, namely, that the principle of exclusive representation in
the public sector is dependent on a union or agency shop. *** [T]his assumption
is unwarranted.
III
A
Despite all this, the State of Illinois now asks us to approve a very substantial
expansion of Abood's reach. Abood involved full-fledged public employees, but
in this case, the status of the personal assistants is much different. The Illinois
Legislature has taken pains to specify that personal assistants are public
employees for one purpose only: collective bargaining. For all other purposes,
Illinois regards the personal assistants as private-sector employees. This
approach has important practical consequences.
For one thing, the State's authority with respect to these two groups is vastly
different. In the case of full-fledged public employees, the State establishes all of
the duties imposed on each employee, as well as all of the qualifications needed
for each position. The State vets applicants and chooses the employees to be
hired. The State provides or arranges for whatever training is needed, and it
supervises and evaluates the employees' job performance and imposes
corrective measures if appropriate. If a state employee's performance is
deficient, the State may discharge the employee in accordance with whatever
procedures are required by law.
With respect to the personal assistants involved in this case, the picture is
entirely changed. The job duties of personal assistants are specified in their
individualized Service Plans, which must be approved by the customer and the
customer's physician. Customers have complete discretion to hire any personal
assistant who meets the meager basic qualifications that the State prescribes
***
Customers supervise their personal assistants on a daily basis, and no
provision of the Illinois statute or implementing regulations gives the State the
right to enter the home in which the personal assistant is employed for the
purpose of checking on the personal assistant's job performance. And while

Robson

401

The First Amendment

state law mandates an annual review of each personal assistant's work, that
evaluation is also controlled by the customer. A state counselor is assigned to
assist the customer in performing the review but has no power to override the
customer's evaluation. Nor do the regulations empower the State to discharge a
personal assistant for substandard performance. Discharge, like hiring, is
entirely in the hands of the customer.
Consistent with this scheme, under which personal assistants are almost
entirely answerable to the customers and not to the State, Illinois withholds
from personal assistants most of the rights and benefits enjoyed by full-fledged
state employees. ***
Just as the State denies personal assistants most of the rights and benefits
enjoyed by full-fledged state workers, the State does not assume responsibility
for actions taken by personal assistants during the course of their employment.
The governing statute explicitly disclaims "vicarious liability in tort." So if a
personal assistant steals from a customer, neglects a customer, or abuses a
customer, the State washes its hands.
Illinois deems personal assistants to be state employees for one purpose only,
collective bargaining * but the scope of bargaining that may be conducted on
their behalf is sharply limited. Under the governing Illinois statute, collective
bargaining can occur only for "terms and conditions of employment that are
within the State's control." That is not very much.
B
1
The unusual status of personal assistants has important implications for
present purposes. Abood's rationale, whatever its strengths and weaknesses, is
based on the assumption that the union possesses the full scope of powers and
duties generally available under American labor law. Under the Illinois scheme
now before us, however, the union's powers and duties are sharply
circumscribed, and as a result, even the best argument for the "extraordinary
power" that Abood allows a union to wield is a poor fit.
In our post-Abood cases involving public-sector agency fee issues, Abood has
been a given, and our task has been to attempt to understand its rationale and
to apply it in a way that is consistent with that rationale. In that vein, Abood's
reasoning has been described as follows. The mere fact that nonunion members
benefit from union speech is not enough to justify an agency fee because
"private speech often furthers the interests of nonspeakers, and that does not
alone empower the state to compel the speech to be paid for." Lehnert (opinion
*

	  	   [fn 10] What is significant is not the label that the State assigns to the personal assistants but
the substance of their relationship to the customers and the State. Our decision rests in no way
on state-law labels. Indeed, it is because the First Amendment's meaning does not turn on statelaw labels that we refuse to allow the state to make a nonemployee a full-fledged employee
"[s]olely for purposes of coverage under the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act” ***

The First Amendment

of SCALIA, J.). What justifies the agency fee, the argument goes, is the fact that
the State compels the union to promote and protect the interests of
nonmembers. Specifically, the union must not discriminate between members
and nonmembers in "negotiating and administering a collective-bargaining
agreement and representing the interests of employees in settling disputes and
processing grievances." This means that the union "cannot, for example,
negotiate particularly high wage increases for its members in exchange for
accepting no increases for others." And it has the duty to provide equal and
effective representation for nonmembers in grievance proceedings, an
undertaking that can be very involved.
This argument has little force in the situation now before us. Illinois law
specifies that personal assistants "shall be paid at the hourly rate set by law,"
and therefore the union cannot be in the position of having to sacrifice higher
pay for its members in order to protect the nonmembers whom it is obligated to
represent. And as for the adjustment of grievances, the union's authority and
responsibilities are narrow, as we have seen. The union has no authority with
respect to any grievances that a personal assistant may have with a customer,
and the customer has virtually complete control over a personal assistant's
work.
The union's limited authority in this area has important practical implications.
Suppose, for example that a customer fires a personal assistant because the
customer wrongly believes that the assistant stole a fork. Or suppose that a
personal assistant is discharged because the assistant shows no interest in the
customer's favorite daytime soaps. Can the union file a grievance on behalf of
the assistant? The answer is no.
2
Because of Abood's questionable foundations, and because the personal
assistants are quite different from full-fledged public employees, we refuse to
extend Abood to the new situation now before us.
It is therefore unnecessary for us to reach petitioners' argument that Abood
should be overruled, and the dissent's extended discussion of stare decisis is
beside the point.
Abood itself has clear boundaries; it applies to public employees. Extending
those boundaries to encompass partial-public employees, quasi-public
employees, or simply private employees would invite problems. Consider a
continuum, ranging, on the one hand, from full-fledged state employees to, on
the other hand, individuals who follow a common calling and benefit from
advocacy or lobbying conducted by a group to which they do not belong and pay
no dues. A State may not force every person who benefits from this group's
efforts to make payments to the group. But what if regulation of this group is
increased? What if the Federal Government or a State begins to provide or
increases subsidies in this area? At what point, short of the point at which the

Robson

403

The First Amendment

individuals in question become full-fledged state employees, should Abood
apply?
If respondents' and the dissent's views were adopted, a host of workers who
receive payments from a governmental entity for some sort of service would be
candidates for inclusion within Abood's reach. Medicare-funded home health
employees may be one such group. The same goes for adult foster care
providers in Oregon and Washington and certain workers under the federal
Child Care and Development Fund programs.
If we allowed Abood to be extended to those who are not full-fledged public
employees, it would be hard to see just where to draw the line, and we therefore
confine Abood's reach to full-fledged state employees.
IV
A
Because Abood is not controlling, we must analyze the constitutionality of the
payments compelled by Illinois law under generally applicable First Amendment
standards. As we explained in Knox, "[t]he government may not prohibit the
dissemination of ideas that it disfavors, nor compel the endorsement of ideas
that it approves." see also, e.g., R.A.V. v. St. Paul, (1992); Riley v. National
Federation of Blind of N.C., (1988) West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943);
Wooley v. Maynard (1977). And "compelled funding of the speech of other
private speakers or groups" presents the same dangers as compelled speech.
Knox. As a result, we explained in Knox that an agency-fee provision imposes "a
'significant impingement on First Amendment rights,'" and this cannot be
tolerated unless it passes "exacting First Amendment scrutiny."
B
For present purposes, however, no fine parsing of levels of First Amendment
scrutiny is needed because the agency-fee provision here cannot satisfy even
the test used in Knox. Specifically, this provision does not serve a '"compelling
state interes[t] . . . that cannot be achieved through means significantly less
restrictive of associational freedoms.'" Respondents contend that the agency-fee
provision in this case furthers several important interests, but none is
sufficient.
1
Focusing on the benefits of the union's status as the exclusive bargaining agent
for all employees in the unit, respondents argue that the agency-fee provision
promotes "labor peace," but their argument largely misses the point. Petitioners
do not contend that they have a First Amendment right to form a rival union.
Nor do they challenge the authority of the SEIU-HII to serve as the exclusive
representative of all the personal assistants in bargaining with the State. All
they seek is the right not to be forced to contribute to the union, with which
they broadly disagree.

Robson

404

The First Amendment

A union's status as exclusive bargaining agent and the right to collect an
agency fee from non-members are not inextricably linked. For example,
employees in some federal agencies may choose a union to serve as the
exclusive bargaining agent for the unit, but no employee is required to join the
union or to pay any union fee. Under federal law, in agencies in which
unionization is permitted, "[e]ach employee shall have the right to form, join, or
assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity, freely and
without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee shall be protected in the
exercise of such right." ***
Moreover, even if the agency fee provision at issue here were tied to the union's
status as exclusive bargaining agents, features of the Illinois scheme would still
undermine the argument that the agency fee plays an important role in
maintaining labor peace. For one thing, any threat to labor peace is diminished
because the personal assistants do not work together in a common state facility
but instead spend all their time in private homes, either the customers' or their
own. Federal labor law reflects the fact that the organization of household
workers like the personal assistants does not further the interest of labor peace.
"[A]ny individual employed . . . in the domestic service of any family or person at
his home" is excluded from coverage under the National Labor Relations Act.
The union's very restricted role under the Illinois law is also significant. Since
the union is largely limited to petitioning the State for greater pay and benefits,
the specter of conflicting demands by personal assistants is lessened. And of
course, State officials must deal on a daily basis with conflicting pleas for
funding in many contexts.
2
Respondents also maintain that the agency-fee provision promotes the welfare
of personal assistants and thus contributes to the success of the Rehabilitation
Program. As a result of unionization, they claim, the wages and benefits of
personal assistants have been substantially improved; orientation and training
programs, background checks, and a program to deal with lost and erroneous
paychecks have been instituted; and a procedure was established to resolve
grievances arising under the collective-bargaining agreement (but apparently
not grievances relating to a Service Plan or actions taken by a customer).
The thrust of these arguments is that the union has been an effective advocate
for personal assistants in the State of Illinois, and we will assume that this is
correct. But in order to pass exacting scrutiny, more must be shown. The
agency-fee provision cannot be sustained unless the cited benefits for personal
assistants could not have been achieved if the union had been required to
depend for funding on the dues paid by those personal assistants who chose to
join. No such showing has been made.
In claiming that the agency fee was needed to bring about the cited
improvements, the State is in a curious position. The State is not like the
closed-fisted employer that is bent on minimizing employee wages and benefits

Robson

405

The First Amendment

and that yields only grudgingly under intense union pressure. As Governor
Blagojevich put it in the executive order that first created the Illinois program,
the State took the initiative because it was eager for "feedback" regarding the
needs and views of the personal assistants. Thereafter, a majority of the
personal assistants voted to unionize. When they did so, they must have
realized that this would require the payment of union dues, and therefore it
may be presumed that a high percentage of these personal assistants became
union members and are willingly paying union dues. Why are these dues
insufficient to enable the union to provide "feedback" to a State that is highly
receptive to suggestions for increased wages and other improvements? A host of
organizations advocate on behalf of the interests of persons falling within an
occupational group, and many of these groups are quite successful even though
they are dependent on voluntary contributions. Respondents' showing falls far
short of what the First Amendment demands.
V
Respondents and their supporting amici make two additional arguments that
must be addressed.
A
First, respondents and the Solicitor General urge us to apply a balancing test
derived from Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will
Cty. (1968). And they claim that under the Pickering analysis, the Illinois
scheme must be sustained. This argument represents an effort to find a new
justification for the decision in Abood, because neither in that case nor in any
subsequent related case have we seen Abood as based on Pickering balancing.
*** [And] even if the permissibility of the agency-shop provision in the collectivebargaining agreement now at issue were analyzed under Pickering, that
provision could not be upheld.
B
Respondents contend, finally, that a refusal to extend Abood to cover the
situation presented in this case will call into question our decisions in Keller v.
State Bar of Cal. (1990), and Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v.
Southworth (2000). Respondents are mistaken.
In Keller, we considered the constitutionality of a rule applicable to all members
of an "integrated" bar, i.e., "an association of attorneys in which membership
and dues are required as a condition of practicing law." We held that members
of this bar could not be required to pay the portion of bar dues used for political
or ideological purposes but that they could be required to pay the portion of the
dues used for activities connected with proposing ethical codes and disciplining
bar members.

Robson

406

The First Amendment

This decision fits comfortably within the framework applied in the present case.
Licensed attorneys are subject to detailed ethics rules, and the bar rule
requiring the payment of dues was part of this regulatory scheme. The portion
of the rule that we upheld served the "State's interest in regulating the legal
profession and improving the quality of legal services." States also have a
strong interest in allocating to the members of the bar, rather than the general
public, the expense of ensuring that attorneys adhere to ethical practices. Thus,
our decision in this case is wholly consistent with our holding in Keller.
Contrary to respondents' submission, the same is true with respect to
Southworth. In that case, we upheld the constitutionality of a universityimposed mandatory student activities fee that was used in part to support a
wide array of student groups that engaged in expressive activity. The mandatory
fee was challenged by students who objected to some of the expression that the
fee was used to subsidize, but we rejected that challenge, and our holding is
entirely consistent with our decision in this case.
Public universities have a compelling interest in promoting student expression
in a manner that is viewpoint neutral. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of
Univ. of Va. (1995). This may be done by providing funding for a broad array of
student groups. If the groups funded are truly diverse, many students are likely
to disagree with things that are said by some groups. And if every student were
entitled to a partial exemption from the fee requirement so that no portion of
the student's fee went to support a group that the student did not wish to
support, the administrative problems would likely be insuperable. Our decision
today thus does not undermine Southworth.
For all these reasons, we refuse to extend Abood in the manner that Illinois
seeks. If we accepted Illinois' argument, we would approve an unprecedented
violation of the bedrock principle that, except perhaps in the rarest of
circumstances, no person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech
by a third party that he or she does not wish to support. The First Amendment
prohibits the collection of an agency fee from personal assistants in the
Rehabilitation Program who do not want to join or support the union.

JUSTICE KAGAN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, AND JUSTICE
SOTOMAYOR JOIN, DISSENTING.
Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. (1977), answers the question presented in this case.
Abood held that a government entity may, consistently with the First
Amendment, require public employees to pay a fair share of the cost that a
union incurs negotiating on their behalf for better terms of employment. That is
exactly what Illinois did in entering into collective bargaining agreements with
the Service Employees International Union Healthcare (SEIU) which included
fair-share provisions. Contrary to the Court's decision, those agreements fall
squarely within Abood’s holding. Here, Illinois employs, jointly with individuals
suffering from disabilities, the in-home care providers whom the SEIU

Robson

407

The First Amendment

represents. Illinois establishes, following negotiations with the union, the most
important terms of their employment, including wages, benefits, and basic
qualifications. And Illinois's interests in imposing fair-share fees apply no less
to those caregivers than to other state workers. The petitioners' challenge
should therefore fail.
And that result would fully comport with our decisions applying the First
Amendment to public employment. Abood is not, as the majority at one point
describes it, "something of an anomaly," allowing uncommon interference with
individuals' expressive activities. Rather, the lines it draws and the balance it
strikes reflect the way courts generally evaluate claims that a condition of
public employment violates the First Amendment. Our decisions have long
afforded government entities broad latitude to manage their workforces, even
when that affects speech they could not regulate in other contexts. Abood is of a
piece with all those decisions: While protecting an employee's most significant
expression, that decision also enables the government to advance its interests
in operating effectively—by bargaining, if it so chooses, with a single employee
representative and preventing free riding on that union's efforts.
For that reason, one aspect of today's opinion is cause for satisfaction, though
hardly applause. As this case came to us, the principal question it presented
was whether to overrule Abood: The petitioners devoted the lion's share of their
briefing and argument to urging us to overturn that nearly 40-year-old
precedent (and the respondents and amici countered in the same vein). Today's
majority cannot resist taking potshots at Abood, but it ignores the petitioners'
invitation to depart from principles of stare decisis. And the essential work in
the majority's opinion comes from its extended (though mistaken) distinction of
Abood, not from its gratuitous dicta critiquing Abood's foundations. That is to
the good—or at least better than it might be. The Abood rule is deeply
entrenched, and is the foundation for not tens or hundreds, but thousands of
contracts between unions and governments across the Nation. Our precedent
about precedent, fairly understood and applied, makes it impossible for this
Court to reverse that decision.
I
I begin where this case should also end—with this Court's decision in Abood. ***
This case thus raises a straightforward question: Does Abood apply equally to
Illinois's care providers as to Detroit's teachers? No one thinks that the fairshare provisions in the two cases differ in any relevant respect. Nor do the
petitioners allege that the SEIU is crossing the line Abood drew by using their
payments for political or ideological activities. The only point in dispute is
whether it matters that the personal assistants here are employees not only of
the State but also of the disabled persons for whom they care. Just as the Court
of Appeals held, that fact should make no difference to the analysis.
To see how easily Abood resolves this case, consider how Illinois structured the
petitioners' employment, and also why it did so. The petitioners work in

Robson

408

The First Amendment

Illinois's Medicaid-funded Rehabilitation Program, which provides in-home
services to persons with
disabilities who otherwise would
face
institutionalization. Under the program, each disabled person (the State calls
them "customers") receives care from a personal assistant; the total workforce
exceeds 20,000. The State could have asserted comprehensive control over all
the caregivers' activities. But because of the personalized nature of the services
provided, Illinois instead chose (as other States have as well) to share authority
with the customers themselves. The result is that each caregiver has joint
employers—the State and the customer—with each controlling significant
aspects of the assistant's work.
The majority describes the petitioners as "partial" or "quasi" public employees, a
label of its own devising. But employment law has a real name—joint
employees—for workers subject at once to the authority of two or more
employers (a not uncommon phenomenon). And the Department of Labor
recently explained that in-home care programs, if structured like Illinois's,
establish joint employment relationships.
For its part, Illinois sets all the workforce-wide terms of employment. Most
notably, the State determines and pays the employees' wages and benefits,
including health insurance (while also withholding taxes). By regulation, Illinois
establishes the job's basic qualifications: for example, the assistant must
provide references or recommendations and have adequate experience and
training for the services given. So too, the State describes the services any
personal assistant may provide, and prescribes the terms of standard
employment contracts entered into between personal assistants and customers.
Illinois as well structures the individual relationship between the customer and
his assistant (in ways the majority barely acknowledges). Along with both the
customer and his physician, a state-employed counselor develops a service plan
laying out the assistant's specific job responsibilities, hours, and working
conditions. That counselor also assists the customer in conducting a statemandated annual performance review, based on state-established criteria, and
mediates any resulting disagreements.
Within the structure designed by the State, the customer of course has crucial
responsibilities. He exercises day-to-day supervisory control over the personal
assistant. And he gets both to hire a particular caregiver (from among the pool
of applicants Illinois has deemed qualified) and to impose any needed discipline,
up to and including discharge. But even as to those matters, the State plays a
role. Before a customer may hire an assistant, the counselor must sign off on
the employee's ability to follow the customer's directions and communicate with
him. And although only a customer can actually fire an assistant, the State can
effectively do so by refusing to pay one who fails to "meet [state] standards." The
majority reads that language narrowly, but the State does not: It has made
clear not just in its litigation papers, but also in its collective bargaining
agreements and customer guidance that it will withhold payment from an
assistant (or altogether disqualify her from the program) based on credible
allegations of customer abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation.

Robson

409

The First Amendment

Indeed, pursuant to the grievance procedure in the present collective bargaining
agreement, the SEIU obtained an arbitration award reversing the State's
decision to disqualify an assistant from the program for such reasons.
Given that set of arrangements, Abood should control. Although a customer can
manage his own relationship with a caregiver, Illinois has sole authority over
every workforce-wide term and condition of the assistants' employment—in
other words, the issues most likely to be the subject of collective bargaining. In
particular, if an assistant wants an increase in pay, she must ask the State, not
the individual customer. So too if she wants better benefits. (Although the
majority notes that caregivers do not receive statutory retirement and health
insurance benefits, that is irrelevant: Collective bargaining between the State
and SEIU has focused on benefits from the beginning, and has produced statefunded health insurance for personal assistants.) And because it is Illinois that
would sit down at a bargaining table to address those subjects—the ones that
matter most to employees and so most affect workforce stability—the State's
stake in a fair-share provision is the same as in Abood. Here too, the State has
an interest in promoting effective operations by negotiating with an equitably
and adequately funded exclusive bargaining agent over terms and conditions of
employment. That Illinois has delegated to program customers various
individualized employment issues makes no difference to those state interests.
If anything, as the State has contended, the dispersion of employees across
numerous workplaces and the absence of day-to-day state supervision provides
an additional reason for Illinois to want to "address concerns common to all
personal assistants" by negotiating with a single representative: Only in that
way, the State explains, can the employees effectively convey their concerns
about employment under the Rehabilitation Program.
Indeed, the history of that program forcefully demonstrates Illinois's interest in
bargaining with an adequately funded exclusive bargaining agent—that is, the
interest Abood recognized and protected. Workforce shortages and high
turnover have long plagued in-home care programs, principally because of low
wages and benefits. That labor instability lessens the quality of care, which in
turn, forces disabled persons into institutions and (massively) increases costs to
the State. See Brief for Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute as Amicus Curiae
16-26; Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 4-5. The individual
customers are powerless to address those systemic issues; rather, the State—
because of its control over workforce-wide terms of employment—is the single
employer that can do so. And here Illinois determined (as have nine other
States) that negotiations with an exclusive representative offered the best
chance to set the Rehabilitation Program on firmer footing. Because of that
bargaining, as the majority acknowledges, home-care assistants have nearly
doubled their wages in less than 10 years, obtained state-funded health
insurance, and benefited from better training and workplace safety measures.
The State, in return, has obtained guarantees against strikes or other work
stoppages—and most important, believes it has gotten a more stable workforce
providing higher quality care, thereby avoiding the costs associated with
institutionalization. Illinois's experience thus might serve as a veritable poster
child for Abood—not, as the majority would have it, some strange extension of
that decision.
Robson

410

The First Amendment

It is not altogether easy to understand why the majority thinks what it thinks:
Today's opinion takes the tack of throwing everything against the wall in the
hope that something might stick. A vain hope, as it turns out. Even once
disentangled, the various strands of the majority's reasoning do not distinguish
this case from Abood.
*** The majority must agree (this Court has made the point often enough) that
"state law labels," adopted for a whole host of reasons, do not determine
whether the State is acting as an employer for purposes of the First
Amendment. The true issue is whether Illinois has a sufficient stake in, and
control over, the petitioners' terms and conditions of employment to implicate
Abood's rationales and trigger its application. And once more, that question has
a clear answer: As I have shown, Illinois negotiates all workforce-wide terms of
the caregivers' employment as part of its effort to promote labor stability and
effectively administer its Rehabilitation Program. As contrasted to that allimportant fact, whether Illinois incurs vicarious liability for caregivers' torts, or
grants them certain statutory benefits like health insurance, is beside the point.
And still more so because the State and SEIU can bargain over most such
matters; for example, as I have noted, the two have reached agreement on
providing state-funded health coverage.
Further, the majority claims, "the scope of bargaining" that the SEIU may
conduct for caregivers is "circumscribed" because the customer has authority
over individualized employment matters like hiring and firing. But (at the risk of
sounding like a broken record) so what? Most States limit the scope of
permissible bargaining in the public sector—often ruling out of bounds similar,
individualized decisions. Here, the scope of collective bargaining—over wages
and benefits, as well as basic duties and qualifications—more than suffices to
implicate the state interests justifying Abood. Those are the matters, after all,
most likely to concern employees generally and thus most likely to affect the
nature and quality of the State's workforce. The idea that Abood applies only if
a union can bargain with the State over every issue comes from nowhere and
relates to nothing in that decision—and would revolutionize public labor law.
Finally, the majority places weight on an idiosyncrasy of Illinois law: that a
regulation requires uniform wages for all personal assistants. According to the
majority, that means Abood's free-rider rationale "has little force in the situation
now before us": Even absent the duty of fair representation (requiring the union
to work on behalf of all employees, members and non-members alike), the
union could not bargain one employee's wages against another's.
The majority also suggests in this part of its opinion that even if the union had
latitude to demand higher wages only for its own supporters, it would not do so.
But why not? A rational union, in the absence of any legal obligation to the
contrary, would almost surely take that approach to bargaining.
But that idea is doubly wrong. First, the Illinois regulation applies only to
wages. It does not cover, for example, the significant health benefits that the
SEIU has obtained for in-home caregivers, or any other benefits for which it

Robson

411

The First Amendment

may bargain in the future. Nor does the regulation prevent preferential
participation in the grievance process, which governs all disputes between
Illinois and caregivers arising from the terms of their agreement. And second,
even if the regulation covered everything subject to collective bargaining, the
majority's reasoning is a non-sequitur. All the regulation would do then is serve
as suspenders to the duty of fair representation's belt: That Illinois has two
ways to ensure that the results of collective bargaining redound to the benefit of
all employees serves to compound, rather than mitigate, the union's free-rider
problem.
As far as I can tell, that covers the majority's reasons for distinguishing this
case from Abood. And even when considered in combination, as the majority
does, they do not succeed. What makes matters still worse is the perverse result
of the majority's decision: It penalizes the State for giving disabled persons
some control over their own care. If Illinois had structured the program, as it
could have, to centralize every aspect of the employment relationship, no
question could possibly have arisen about Abood's application. Nothing should
change because the State chose to respect the dignity and independence of
program beneficiaries by allowing them to select and discharge, as well as
supervise day-to-day, their own caregivers. A joint employer remains an
employer, and here, as I have noted, Illinois kept authority over all workforcewide terms of employment—the very issues most likely to be the subject of
collective bargaining. The State thus should also retain the prerogative—as part
of its effort to "ensure efficient and effective delivery of personal care services"—
to require all employees to contribute fairly to their bargaining agent.
II
Perhaps recognizing the difficulty of plausibly distinguishing this case from
Abood, the petitioners raised a more fundamental question: the continued
viability of Abood as to all public employees, even what the majority calls "fullfledged" ones.
Abood is not just any precedent: It is entrenched in a way not many decisions
are. Over nearly four decades, we have cited Abood favorably numerous times,
and we have repeatedly affirmed and applied its core distinction between the
costs of collective bargaining (which the government can demand its employees
share) and those of political activities (which it cannot). Reviewing those
decisions, this Court recently—and unanimously—called the Abood rule "a
general First Amendment principle." And indeed, the Court has relied on that
rule in deciding cases involving compulsory fees outside the labor context—
which today's majority reaffirms as good law. Not until two years ago, in Knox v.
Service Employees (2012), did the Court so much as whisper (there without the
benefit of briefing or argument, that it had any misgivings about Abood.
Perhaps still more important, Abood has created enormous reliance interests.
More than 20 States have enacted statutes authorizing fair-share provisions,
and on that basis public entities of all stripes have entered into multi-year
contracts with unions containing such clauses. "Stare decisis has added force,"

Robson

412

The First Amendment

we have held, when overturning a precedent would require "States to reexamine
[and amend] their statutes."
Readers of today's decision will know that Abood does not rank on the
majority's top-ten list of favorite precedents—and that the majority could not
restrain itself from saying (and saying and saying) so. Yet they will also know
that the majority could not, even after receiving full-dress briefing and
argument, come up with reasons anywhere near sufficient to reverse the
decision. Much has gone wrong in today's ruling, but this has not: Save for an
unfortunate hiving off of ostensibly "partial-public" employees, Abood remains
the law.
This Court, the majority insists, has never "seen Abood as based on Pickering
balancing." But to rely on Aboods failure to cite Pickering more often, as the
majority does, is to miss the essential point. Although stemming from different
historic antecedents, the two decisions addressed variants of the same issue:
the extent of the government's power to adopt employment conditions affecting
expression. And as just discussed, the two gave strikingly parallel answers,
providing a coherent framework to adjudicate the constitutionality of those
regulations.
To the extent the majority engages with that framework, its analysis founders at
the first step, in assessing the First Amendment value of the speech at issue
here. A running motif of the majority opinion is that collective bargaining in the
public sector raises significant questions about the level of government
spending. By financing the SEIU's collective bargaining over wages and benefits,
the majority suggests, in-home caregivers—whether they wish to or not—take
one side in a debate about those issues.
But that view of the First Amendment interests at stake blinks decades' worth
of this Court's precedent. Our decisions (tracing from Pickering as well as
Abood) teach that internal workplace speech about public employees' wages,
benefits, and such—that is, the prosaic stuff of collective bargaining—does not
become speech of "public concern" just because those employment terms may
have broader consequence. To the contrary, we have made clear that except in
narrow circumstances we will not allow an employee to make a "federal
constitutional issue" out of basic "employment matters, including working
conditions, pay, discipline, promotions, leave, vacations, and terminations."
Indeed, even Abood's original detractors conceded that an employee's interest in
expressing views, within the workplace context, about "narrowly defined
economic issues [like] salaries and pension benefits" is "relatively insignificant"
and "weak." And nowhere has the Court ever suggested, as the majority does
today, that if a certain dollar amount is at stake (but how much, exactly?), the
constitutional treatment of an employee's expression becomes any different.
Consider an analogy, not involving union fees: Suppose an employee violates a
government employer's work rules by demanding, at various inopportune times
and places, higher wages for both himself and his co-workers (which, of course,
will drive up public spending). The government employer disciplines the

Robson

413

The First Amendment

employee, and he brings a First Amendment claim. Would the Court consider
his speech a matter of public concern under Pickering? I cannot believe it
would, and indeed the petitioners' own counsel joins me in that view. He
maintained at oral argument that such speech would concern merely an
"internal proprietary matter," thus allowing the employer to take disciplinary
action. If the majority thinks otherwise, government entities across the country
should prepare themselves for unprecedented limitations on their ability to
regulate their workforces. But again, I doubt they need to worry, because this
Court has never come close to holding that any matter of public employment
affecting public spending (which is to say most such matters) becomes for that
reason alone an issue of public concern. (And on the off-chance that both the
petitioners and I are wrong on that score, I am doubly confident that the
government would prevail under Pickering's balancing test.)
I can see no reason to treat the expressive interests of workers objecting to
payment of union fees, like the petitioners here, as worthy of greater
consideration. The subject matter of the speech is the same: wages and benefits
for public employees. Or to put the point more fully: In both cases (mine and
the real one), the employer is sanctioning employees for choosing either to say
or not to say something respecting their terms and conditions of employment.
Of course, in my hypothetical, the employer is stopping the employee from
speaking, whereas in this or any other case involving union fees, the employer
is forcing the employee to support such expression. But I am sure the majority
would agree that that difference does not make a difference—in other words,
that the "difference between compelled speech and compelled silence" is
"without constitutional significance." Hence, in analyzing the kind of expression
involved in this case, Abood corresponds to Pickering (and vice versa)— with
each permitting a government to regulate such activity in aid of managing its
workforce to provide public services.
This case in fact offers a prime illustration of how a fairshare agreement may
serve important government interests. Recall that Illinois decided that collective
bargaining with an exclusive representative of in-home caregivers would enable
it to provide improved services through its Rehabilitation Program. The State
thought such bargaining would enable it to attract a better and more stable
workforce to serve disabled patients, preventing their institutionalization and
thereby decreasing total state expenditures. The majority does not deny the
State's legitimate interest in choosing to negotiate with an exclusive bargaining
agent, in service of administering an effective program. But the majority does
deny Illinois the means it reasonably deemed appropriate to effectuate that
policy—a fair-share provision ensuring that the union has the funds necessary
to carry out its responsibilities on behalf of in-home care-givers. The majority
does so against the weight of all precedent, and based on "empirical
assumption[s]," lacking any foundation. Abood got this matter right; the
majority gets it wrong: Illinois has a more than sufficient interest, in managing
its workforce and administering the Rehabilitation Program, to require
employees to pay a fair share of a union's costs of collective bargaining.
III

Robson

414

The First Amendment

For many decades, Americans have debated the pros and cons of right-to-work
laws and fair-share requirements. All across the country and continuing to the
present day, citizens have engaged in passionate argument about the issue and
have made disparate policy choices. The petitioners in this case asked this
Court to end that discussion for the entire public sector, by overruling Abood
and thus imposing a right-to-work regime for all government employees. The
good news out of this case is clear: The majority declined that radical request.
The Court did not, as the petitioners wanted, deprive every state and local
government, in the management of their employees and programs, of the tool
that many have thought necessary and appropriate to make collective
bargaining work.
The bad news is just as simple: The majority robbed Illinois of that choice in
administering its in-home care program. For some 40 years, Abood has struck a
stable balance—consistent with this Court's general framework for assessing
public employees' First Amendment claims— between those employees' rights
and government entities' interests in managing their workforces. The majority
today misapplies Abood, which properly should control this case. Nothing
separates, for purposes of that decision, Illinois's personal assistants from any
other public employees. The balance Abood struck thus should have defeated
the petitioners' demand to invalidate Illinois's fair-share agreement. I
respectfully dissent.

Notes	  	  
1.
In Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.S. 209 (1977), the Court
upheld an “agency shop” clause that allowed the assessment of dues on
all employees insofar as they were used to finance expenditures by the
union for collective bargaining, contract administration and grievance
adjustment purposes. How does the Court’s decision in Harris v. Quinn
alter Abood?
2.
The status of Abood is uncertain. In January 2015, the Court
granted certiorari in Friedrichs v. Cal. Teachers Association and certified
the first question as "Should Abood be overruled?" Most commentators
believed that the oral argument indicated that a majority of the Court
was leaning toward overruling Abood. However, a little over a month
after Justice Scalia’s death in February 2016, the equally divided Court
of 8 Justices issued a per curiam opinion reading in full : “The judgment
is affirmed by an equally divided Court.” Thus the Ninth Circuit’s opinion
affirming the constitutionality of the California union scheme was upheld.
3.
The Court in Abood held that the First Amendment prohibited a
union (or the employer) from requiring any teacher to contribute to
support of an ideological cause he might oppose as a condition of holding
a job as a public school teacher. Given the Court’s discussions in Keller
and Southworth, how would you advise a bar association or law school at
a university regarding “ideological” causes that might be promoted?

Would this include a mandatory pro bono requirement for attorneys or

As footnote 2 in Johanns states, the United States Department of
Agriculture has administered many similar “programs of promotional
advertising, funded by checkoffs, for a number of other agricultural
commodities. See 7 CFR §1205.10 et seq. (2004) (cotton); §1207.301 et

Can an anti-discrimination law or policy violate the First Amendment’s

included within freedom of speech. There is some overlap in these cases
between compelled association and compelled speech, although the
speech is not necessarily direct.

515 U.S. 557 (1995)

SOUTER, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION FOR A UNANIMOUS COURT.
March 17 is set aside for two celebrations in South Boston. As early as 1737,
some people in Boston observed the feast of the apostle to Ireland, and since
1776 the day has marked the evacuation of royal troops and Loyalists from the
city, prompted by the guns captured at Ticonderoga and set up on Dorchester
Heights under General Washington's command. Washington himself reportedly
drew on the earlier tradition in choosing "St. Patrick" as the response to
"Boston," the password used in the colonial lines on evacuation day. ***
Although the General Court of Massachusetts did not officially designate March
17 as Evacuation Day until 1938, the City Council of Boston had previously
sponsored public celebrations of Evacuation Day, including notable
commemorations on the centennial in 1876, and on the 125th anniversary in
1901, with its parade, salute, concert, and fireworks display. ***

Robson

416

The First Amendment

The tradition of formal sponsorship by the city came to an end in 1947,
however, when Mayor James Michael Curley himself granted authority to
organize and conduct the St. Patrick's Day Evacuation Day Parade to the
petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, an unincorporated
association of individuals elected from various South Boston veterans groups.
Every year since that time, the Council has applied for and received a permit for
the parade, which at times has included as many as 20,000 marchers and
drawn up to 1 million watchers. No other applicant has ever applied for that
permit. Through 1992, the city allowed the Council to use the city's official seal,
and provided printing services as well as direct funding.
1992 was the year that a number of gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of
the Irish immigrants joined together with other supporters to form the
respondent organization, GLIB, to march in the parade as a way to express
pride in their Irish heritage as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to
demonstrate that there are such men and women among those so descended,
and to express their solidarity with like individuals who sought to march in New
York's St. Patrick's Day Parade. Although the Council denied GLIB's application
to take part in the 1992 parade, GLIB obtained a state court order to include its
contingent, which marched "uneventfully" among that year's 10,000
participants and 750,000 spectators.
In 1993, after the Council had again refused to admit GLIB to the upcoming
parade, the organization and some of its members filed this suit against the
Council, the individual petitioner John J. "Wacko" Hurley, and the City of
Boston, alleging violations of the State and Federal Constitutions and of the
state public accommodations law, which prohibits "any distinction,
discrimination or restriction on account of . . . sexual orientation . . . relative to
the admission of any person to, or treatment in any place of public
accommodation, resort or amusement." After finding that "[f]or at least the past
47 years, the Parade has traveled the same basic route along the public streets
of South Boston, providing entertainment, amusement, and recreation to
participants and spectators alike," the state trial court ruled that the parade fell
within the statutory definition of a public accommodation, which includes "any
place . . . which is open to and accepts or solicits the patronage of the general
public and, without limiting the generality of this definition, whether or not it be
. . . (6) a boardwalk or other public highway [or] . . . (8) a place of public
amusement, recreation, sport, exercise or entertainment," Mass. Gen. Laws
§272:92A. The court found that the Council had no written criteria and
employed no particular procedures for admission, voted on new applications in
batches, had occasionally admitted groups who simply showed up at the parade
without having submitted an application, and did "not generally inquire into the
specific messages or views of each applicant." The court consequently rejected
the Council's contention that the parade was "private" (in the sense of being
exclusive), holding instead that "the lack of genuine selectivity in choosing
participants and sponsors demonstrates that the Parade is a public event." It
found the parade to be "eclectic," containing a wide variety of "patriotic,
commercial, political, moral, artistic, religious, athletic, public service, trade
union, and eleemosynary themes," as well as conflicting messages. While noting
that the Council had indeed excluded the Ku Klux Klan and ROAR (an
Robson

417

The First Amendment

antibusing group), it attributed little significance to these facts, concluding
ultimately that "[t]he only common theme among the participants and sponsors
is their public involvement in the Parade."
The court rejected the Council's assertion that the exclusion of "groups with
sexual themes merely formalized [the fact] that the Parade expresses traditional
religious and social values," and found the Council's "final position [to be] that
GLIB would be excluded because of its values and its message, i.e., its
members' sexual orientation." This position, in the court's view, was not only
violative of the public accommodations law but "paradoxical" as well, since "a
proper celebration of St. Patrick's and Evacuation Day requires diversity and
inclusiveness." The court rejected the notion that GLIB's admission would
trample on the Council's First Amendment rights since the court understood
that constitutional protection of any interest in expressive association would
"requir[e] focus on a specific message, theme, or group" absent from the parade.
"Given the [Council's] lack of selectivity in choosing participants and failure to
circumscribe the marchers' message," the court found it "impossible to discern
any specific expressive purpose entitling the Parade to protection under the
First Amendment." It concluded that the parade is "not an exercise of [the
Council's] constitutionally protected right of expressive association," but instead
"an open recreational event that is subject to the public accommodations law."
If there were no reason for a group of people to march from here to there except
to reach a destination, they could make the trip without expressing any
message beyond the fact of the march itself. Some people might call such a
procession a parade, but it would not be much of one. Real "[p]arades are
public dramas of social relations, and in them performers define who can be a
social actor and what subjects and ideas are available for communication and
consideration." S. DAVIS, PARADES AND POWER: STREET THEATRE IN NINETEENTH
CENTURY PHILADELPHIA 6 (1986). Hence, we use the word "parade" to indicate
marchers who are making some sort of collective point, not just to each other
but to bystanders along the way. Indeed a parade's dependence on watchers is
so extreme that nowadays, as with Bishop Berkeley's celebrated tree, "if a
parade or demonstration receives no media coverage, it may as well not have
happened." Parades are thus a form of expression, not just motion, and the
inherent expressiveness of marching to make a point explains our cases
involving protest marches. In Gregory v. Chicago (1969), for example, petitioners
had taken part in a procession to express their grievances to the city
government, and we held that such a "march, if peaceful and orderly, falls well
within the sphere of conduct protected by the First Amendment." Similarly, in
Edwards v. South Carolina (1963), where petitioners had joined in a march of
protest and pride, carrying placards and singing The Star Spangled Banner, we
held that the activities "reflect an exercise of these basic constitutional rights in
their most pristine and classic form."
The protected expression that inheres in a parade is not limited to its banners
and songs, however, for the Constitution looks beyond written or spoken words
as mediums of expression. Noting that "[s]ymbolism is a primitive but effective
way of communicating ideas," West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943), our

Robson

418

The First Amendment

cases have recognized that the First Amendment shields such acts as saluting a
flag (and refusing to do so), wearing an arm band to protest a war, Tinker v. Des
Moines Independent Community School Dist. (1969), displaying a red flag,
Stromberg v. California (1931), and even "[m]arching, walking or parading" in
uniforms displaying the swastika, National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie
(1977). As some of these examples show, a narrow, succinctly articulable
message is not a condition of constitutional protection, which if confined to
expressions conveying a "particularized message," cf. Spence v. Washington
1974) (per curiam), would never reach the unquestionably shielded painting of
Jackson Pollock, music of Arnold Schönberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis
Carroll.
Not many marches, then, are beyond the realm of expressive parades, and the
South Boston celebration is not one of them. Spectators line the streets; people
march in costumes and uniforms, carrying flags and banners with all sorts of
messages (e.g., "England get out of Ireland," "Say no to drugs"); marching bands
and pipers play, floats are pulled along, and the whole show is broadcast over
Boston television. To be sure, we agree with the state courts that in spite of
excluding some applicants, the Council is rather lenient in admitting
participants. But a private speaker does not forfeit constitutional protection
simply by combining multifarious voices, or by failing to edit their themes to
isolate an exact message as the exclusive subject matter of the speech. Nor,
under our precedent, does First Amendment protection require a speaker to
generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the communication. Cable
operators, for example, are engaged in protected speech activities even when
they only select programming originally produced by others. Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC (1994). For that matter, the presentation of an
edited compilation of speech generated by other persons is a staple of most
newspapers' opinion pages, which, of course, fall squarely within the core of
First Amendment security, as does even the simple selection of a paid
noncommercial advertisement for inclusion in a daily paper. The selection of
contingents to make a parade is entitled to similar protection.
Respondents' participation as a unit in the parade was equally expressive. GLIB
was formed for the very purpose of marching in it, as the trial court found, in
order to celebrate its members' identity as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual
descendants of the Irish immigrants, to show that there are such individuals in
the community, and to support the like men and women who sought to march
in the New York parade. The organization distributed a fact sheet describing the
members' intentions, and the record otherwise corroborates the expressive
nature of GLIB's participation. In 1993, members of GLIB marched behind a
shamrock strewn banner with the simple inscription "Irish American Gay,
Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston." GLIB understandably seeks to
communicate its ideas as part of the existing parade, rather than staging one of
its own.
The Massachusetts public accommodations law under which respondents
brought suit has a venerable history. At common law, innkeepers, smiths, and

Robson

419

The First Amendment

others who "made profession of a public employment," were prohibited from
refusing, without good reason, to serve a customer.
In the case before us, however, the Massachusetts law has been applied in a
peculiar way. Its enforcement does not address any dispute about the
participation of openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual individuals in various units
admitted to the parade. The petitioners disclaim any intent to exclude
homosexuals as such, and no individual member of GLIB claims to have been
excluded from parading as a member of any group that the Council has
approved to march. Instead, the disagreement goes to the admission of GLIB as
its own parade unit carrying its own banner. Since every participating unit
affects the message conveyed by the private organizers, the state courts'
application of the statute produced an order essentially requiring petitioners to
alter the expressive content of their parade. Although the state courts spoke of
the parade as a place of public accommodation, once the expressive character
of both the parade and the marching GLIB contingent is understood, it becomes
apparent that the state courts' application of the statute had the effect of
declaring the sponsors' speech itself to be the public accommodation. Under
this approach any contingent of protected individuals with a message would
have the right to participate in petitioners' speech, so that the communication
produced by the private organizers would be shaped by all those protected by
the law who wished to join in with some expressive demonstration of their own.
But this use of the State's power violates the fundamental rule of protection
under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the
content of his own message.
"Since all speech inherently involves choices of what to say and what to leave
unsaid," Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n of Cal. (1986)
(plurality opinion) (emphasis in original), one important manifestation of the
principle of free speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide "what
not to say."
Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle of autonomy to control one's
own speech is as sound as the South Boston parade is expressive. Rather like a
composer, the Council selects the expressive units of the parade from potential
participants, and though the score may not produce a particularized message,
each contingent's expression in the Council's eyes comports with what merits
celebration on that day. Even if this view gives the Council credit for a more
considered judgment than it actively made, the Council clearly decided to
exclude a message it did not like from the communication it chose to make, and
that is enough to invoke its right as a private speaker to shape its expression by
speaking on one subject while remaining silent on another. The message it
disfavored is not difficult to identify. Although GLIB's point (like the Council's)
is not wholly articulate, a contingent marching behind the organization's
banner would at least bear witness to the fact that some Irish are gay, lesbian,
or bisexual, and the presence of the organized marchers would suggest their
view that people of their sexual orientations have as much claim to unqualified
social acceptance as heterosexuals and indeed as members of parade units
organized around other identifying characteristics. The parade's organizers may

Robson

420

The First Amendment

not believe these facts about Irish sexuality to be so, or they may object to
unqualified social acceptance of gays and lesbians or have some other reason
for wishing to keep GLIB's message out of the parade. But whatever the reason,
it boils down to the choice of a speaker not to propound a particular point of
view, and that choice is presumed to lie beyond the government's power to
control.
Parades and demonstrations, in contrast [to cable broadcasting] are not
understood to be so neutrally presented or selectively viewed. Unlike the
programming offered on various channels by a cable network, the parade does
not consist of individual, unrelated segments that happen to be transmitted
together for individual selection by members of the audience. Although each
parade unit generally identifies itself, each is understood to contribute
something to a common theme, and accordingly there is no customary practice
whereby private sponsors disavow "any identity of viewpoint" between
themselves and the selected participants. Practice follows practicability here, for
such disclaimers would be quite curious in a moving parade. * * * Without
deciding on the precise significance of the likelihood of misattribution, it
nonetheless becomes clear that in the context of an expressive parade, as with
a protest march, the parade's overall message is distilled from the individual
presentations along the way, and each unit's expression is perceived by
spectators as part of the whole.
Our holding today rests not on any particular view about the Council's message
but on the Nation's commitment to protect freedom of speech. Disapproval of a
private speaker's statement does not legitimize use of the Commonwealth's
power to compel the speaker to alter the message by including one more
acceptable to others. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court
[of Massachusetts] is reversed * * *

is a private, not-for- profit organization engaged in instilling its system of values
in young people. The Boy Scouts asserts that homosexual conduct is

James Dale entered Scouting in 1978 at the age of eight by joining Monmouth
Council’s Cub Scout Pack 142. Dale became a Boy Scout in 1981 and remained
a Scout until he turned 18. By all accounts, Dale was an exemplary Scout. In
1988, he achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, one of Scouting’s highest honors.
Dale applied for adult membership in the Boy Scouts in 1989. The Boy Scouts
approved his application for the position of assistant scoutmaster of Troop 73.
Around the same time, Dale left home to attend Rutgers University. After
arriving at Rutgers, Dale first acknowledged to himself and others that he is gay.
He quickly became involved with, and eventually became the copresident of, the
Rutgers University Lesbian/Gay Alliance. In 1990, Dale attended a seminar
addressing the psychological and health needs of lesbian and gay teenagers. A
newspaper covering the event inter- viewed Dale about his advocacy of
homosexual teenagers’ need for gay role models. In early July 1990, the newspaper published the interview and Dale’s photograph over a caption identifying
him as the copresident of the Lesbian/ Gay Alliance.
Later that month, Dale received a letter from Monmouth Council Executive
James Kay revoking his adult membership. Dale wrote to Kay requesting the
reason for Monmouth Council’s decision. Kay responded by letter that the Boy
Scouts “specifically forbid membership to homosexuals.”
In 1992, Dale filed a complaint against the Boy Scouts in the New Jersey
Superior Court. The complaint alleged that the Boy Scouts had violated New
Jersey’s public accommodations statute and its common law by revoking Dale’s
membership based solely on his sexual orientation. New Jersey’s public
accommodations statute prohibits, among other things, discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation in places of public accommodation. *** The New
Jersey Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Division [in Dale’s
favor].

In Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984), we observed that “implicit in the
right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment” is “a
corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of
political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.” This right
is crucial in preventing the majority from imposing its views on groups that
would rather express other, perhaps unpopular, ideas. Government actions
that may unconstitutionally burden this freedom may take many forms, one of
which is “intrusion into the internal structure or affairs of an association” like a
“regulation that forces the group to accept members it does not desire.” Forcing
a group to accept certain members may impair the ability of the group to
express those views, and only those views, that it intends to express. Thus,
“[f]reedom of association . . . plainly presupposes a freedom not to associate.”
The forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group infringes the group’s
freedom of expressive association if the presence of that person affects in a

Robson

422

The First Amendment

significant way the group’s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints. But
the freedom of expressive association, like many freedoms, is not absolute. We
have held that the freedom could be overridden “by regulations adopted to serve
compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be
achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.”
To determine whether a group is protected by the First Amendment’s expressive
associational right, we must deter- mine whether the group engages in
“expressive association.” The First Amendment’s protection of expressive
association is not reserved for advocacy groups. But to come within its ambit, a
group must engage in some form of expression, whether it be public or private.
Because this is a First Amendment case where the ultimate conclusions of law
are virtually inseparable from findings of fact, we are obligated to independently
review the factual record to ensure that the state court’s judgment does not
unlawfully intrude on free expression. See Hurley. The record reveals the
following. The Boy Scouts is a private, nonprofit organization. According to its
mission statement:
“It is the mission of the Boy Scouts of America to serve others by helping to
instill values in young people and, in other ways, to prepare them to make
ethical choices over their lifetime in achieving their full potential.
“The values we strive to instill are based on those found in the Scout Oath and
Law:
“Scout Oath
“On my honor I will do my best “To do my duty to God and my country “and to
obey the Scout Law; “To help other people at all times; “To keep myself
physically strong, “mentally awake, and morally straight.
“A Scout is: “Trustworthy “Loyal “Helpful “Friendly “Courteous “Kind
“Scout Law
Obedient Cheerful Thrifty Brave Clean Reverent. ”

Thus, the general mission of the Boy Scouts is clear: “[T]o instill values in
young people.” The Boy Scouts seeks to instill these values by having its adult
leaders spend time with the youth members, instructing and engaging them in
activities like camping, archery, and fishing. During the time spent with the
youth members, the scoutmasters and assistant scoutmasters inculcate them
with the Boy Scouts’ values—both expressly and by example. It seems
indisputable that an association that seeks to transmit such a system of values
engages in expressive activity. See Roberts (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“Even the
training of outdoor survival skills or participation in community service might
become expressive when the activity is intended to develop good morals,
reverence, patriotism, and a desire for self-improvement”).
Given that the Boy Scouts engages in expressive activity, we must determine
whether the forced inclusion of Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would
significantly affect the Boy Scouts’ ability to advocate public or private
viewpoints. This inquiry necessarily requires us first to explore, to a limited
extent, the nature of the Boy Scouts’ view of homosexuality.
The values the Boy Scouts seeks to instill are “based on” those listed in the

Robson

423

The First Amendment

Scout Oath and Law. The Boy Scouts explains that the Scout Oath and Law
provide “a positive moral code for living; they are a list of ‘do’s’ rather than
‘don’ts.’” The Boy Scouts asserts that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with
the values embodied in the Scout Oath and Law, particularly with the values
represented by the terms “morally straight” and “clean.”
Obviously, the Scout Oath and Law do not expressly mention sexuality or
sexual orientation. And the terms “morally straight” and “clean” are by no
means self-defining. Different people would attribute to those terms very
different meanings. For example, some people may believe that engaging in
homosexual conduct is not at odds with being “morally straight” and “clean.”
And others may believe that engaging in homosexual conduct is contrary to
being “morally straight” and “clean.” The Boy Scouts says it falls within the
latter category.
The New Jersey Supreme Court analyzed the Boy Scouts’ beliefs and found that
the “exclusion of members solely on the basis of their sexual orientation is
inconsistent with Boy Scouts’ commitment to a diverse and ‘representative’
membership . . . [and] contradicts Boy Scouts’ overarching objective to reach ‘all
eligible youth.’” The court concluded that the exclusion of members like Dale
“appears antithetical to the organization’s goals and philosophy.” But our cases
reject this sort of inquiry; it is not the role of the courts to reject a group’s
expressed values because they disagree with those values or find them
internally inconsistent.
The Boy Scouts asserts that it “teach[es] that homosexual conduct is not
morally straight,” and that it does “not want to promote homosexual conduct as
a legitimate form of behavior.” We accept the Boy Scouts’ assertion. We need
not inquire further to determine the nature of the Boy Scouts’ expression with
respect to homosexuality. But because the record before us contains written
evidence of the Boy Scouts’ view- point, we look to it as instructive, if only on
the question of the sincerity of the professed beliefs.
We cannot doubt that the Boy Scouts sincerely holds this view.
We must then determine whether Dale’s presence as an assistant scoutmaster
would significantly burden the Boy Scouts’ desire to not “promote homosexual
conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.” As we give deference to an
association’s assertions regarding the nature of its expression, we must also
give deference to an association’s view of what would impair its expression. That
is not to say that an expressive association can erect a shield against
antidiscrimination laws simply by asserting that mere acceptance of a member
from a particular group would impair its message. But here Dale, by his own
admission, is one of a group of gay Scouts who have “become leaders in their
community and are open and honest about their sexual orientation.” Dale was
the copresident of a gay and lesbian organization at college and remains a gay
rights activist. Dale’s presence in the Boy Scouts would, at the very least, force
the organization to send a message, both to the youth members and the world,
that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of
behavior.
Hurley is illustrative on this point. There we considered whether the application
of Massachusetts’ public accommodations law to require the organizers of a

Robson

424

The First Amendment

private St. Patrick’s Day parade to include among the marchers an IrishAmerican gay, lesbian, and bisexual group, GLIB, violated the parade
organizers’ First Amendment rights. We noted that the parade organizers did
not wish to exclude the GLIB members because of their sexual orientations, but
because they wanted to march behind a GLIB banner. ***
Here, we have found that the Boy Scouts believes that homo- sexual conduct is
inconsistent with the values it seeks to instill in its youth members; it will not
“promote homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.” As the
presence of GLIB in Boston’s St. Patrick’s Day parade would have interfered
with the parade organizers’ choice not to propound a particular point of view,
the presence of Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would just as surely interfere
with the Boy Scout’s choice not to propound a point of view contrary to its
beliefs.
The New Jersey Supreme Court determined that the Boy Scouts’ ability to
disseminate its message was not significantly affected by the forced inclusion of
Dale as an assistant scoutmaster because of the following findings:
“Boy Scout members do not associate for the purpose of disseminating the belief
that homosexuality is immoral; Boy Scouts discourages its leaders from
disseminating any views on sexual issues; and Boy Scouts includes sponsors
and members who subscribe to different views in respect of homosexuality.”

We disagree with the New Jersey Supreme Court’s conclusion drawn from these
findings.
First, associations do not have to associate for the “purpose” of disseminating a
certain message in order to be entitled to the protections of the First
Amendment. An association must merely engage in expressive activity that
could be impaired in order to be entitled to protection. For example, the
purpose of the St. Patrick’s Day parade in Hurley was not to espouse any views
about sexual orientation, but we held that the parade organizers had a right to
exclude certain participants nonetheless.
Second, even if the Boy Scouts discourages Scout leaders from disseminating
views on sexual issues—a fact that the Boy Scouts disputes with contrary
evidence—the First Amendment protects the Boy Scouts’ method of expression.
If the Boy Scouts wishes Scout leaders to avoid questions of sexuality and teach
only by example, this fact does not negate the sincerity of its belief discussed
above.
Third, the First Amendment simply does not require that every member of a
group agree on every issue in order for the group’s policy to be “expressive
association.” The Boy Scouts takes an official position with respect to
homosexual conduct, and that is sufficient for First Amendment purposes. In
this same vein, Dale makes much of the claim that the Boy Scouts does not
revoke the membership of heterosexual Scout leaders that openly disagree with
the Boy Scouts’ policy on sexual orientation. But if this is true, it is irrelevant.
The presence of an avowed homosexual and gay rights activist in an assistant
scoutmaster’s uniform sends a distinctly different message from the presence of
a heterosexual assistant scoutmaster who is on record as disagreeing with Boy
Scouts policy. The Boy Scouts has a First Amendment right to choose to send
one message but not the other. The fact that the organization does not trumpet

Robson

425

The First Amendment

its views from the housetops, or that it tolerates dissent within its ranks, does
not mean that its views receive no First Amendment protection.
Having determined that the Boy Scouts is an expressive association and that
the forced inclusion of Dale would significantly affect its expression, we inquire
whether the application of New Jersey’s public accommodations law to require
that the Boy Scouts accept Dale as an assistant scoutmaster runs afoul of the
Scouts’ freedom of expressive association. We conclude that it does.
In Hurley, we applied traditional First Amendment analysis to hold that the
application of the Massachusetts public accommodations law to a parade
violated the First Amendment rights of the parade organizers. Although we did
not explicitly deem the parade in Hurley an expressive association, the analysis
we applied there is similar to the analysis we apply here. We have already
concluded that a state requirement that the Boy Scouts retain Dale as an
assistant scoutmaster would significantly burden the organization’s right to
oppose or disfavor homosexual conduct. The state interests embodied in New
Jersey’s public accommodations law do not justify such a severe intrusion on
the Boy Scouts’ rights to freedom of expressive association. That being the case,
we hold that the First Amendment prohibits the State from imposing such a
requirement through the application of its public accommodations law.
We are not, as we must not be, guided by our views of whether the Boy Scouts’
teachings with respect to homosexual conduct are right or wrong; public or
judicial disapproval of a tenet of an organization’s expression does not justify
the State’s effort to compel the organization to accept members where such
acceptance would derogate from the organization’s expressive message. “While
the law is free to pro- mote all sorts of conduct in place of harmful behavior, it
is not free to interfere with speech for no better reason than promoting an
approved message or discouraging a disfavored one, however enlightened either
purpose may strike the government.”
The judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court is reversed. ***
JUSTICE STEVENS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG, AND JUSTICE
BREYER JOIN, DISSENTING.
*** The majority holds that New Jersey’s law violates BSA’s right to associate
and its right to free speech. But that law does not “impos[e] any serious
burdens” on BSA’s “collective effort on behalf of [its] shared goals,” nor does it
force BSA to communicate any message that it does not wish to endorse. New
Jersey’s law, therefore, abridges no constitutional right of BSA.
*** In this case, BSA contends that it teaches the young boys who are Scouts
that homosexuality is immoral. Consequently, it argues, it would violate its
right to associate to force it to admit homosexuals as members, as doing so
would be at odds with its own shared goals and values. This contention, quite
plainly, requires us to look at what, exactly, are the values that BSA actually
teaches.
BSA’s mission statement reads as follows: “It is the mission of the Boy Scouts of
America to serve others by helping to instill values in young people and, in
other ways, to prepare them to make ethical choices over their lifetime in
Robson

426

The First Amendment

achieving their full potential.” Its federal charter declares its purpose is “to
promote, through organization, and cooperation with other agencies, the ability
of boys to do things for themselves and others, to train them in scoutcraft, and
to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred values, using the
methods which were in common use by Boy Scouts on June 15, 1916.” BSA
describes itself as having a “representative membership,” which it defines as
“boy membership [that] reflects proportionately the characteristics of the boy
population of its service area.”In particular, the group emphasizes that
“[n]either the charter nor the by- laws of the Boy Scouts of America permits the
exclusion of any boy. . . . To meet these responsibilities we have made a
commitment that our membership shall be representative of all the population
in every community, district, and council.” (emphasis in original).
To instill its shared values, BSA has adopted a “Scout Oath” and a “Scout Law”
setting forth its central tenets. For example, the Scout Law requires a member
to promise, among other things, that he will be “obedient.” Accompanying
definitions for the terms found in the Oath and Law are provided in the Boy
Scout Handbook and the Scoutmaster Handbook. For instance, the Boy Scout
Handbook defines “obedient” as follows:
“A Scout is OBEDIENT. A Scout follows the rules of his family, school, and troop.
He obeys the laws of his community and country. If he thinks these rules and
laws are unfair, he tries to have them changed in an orderly manner rather than
disobey them.”

To bolster its claim that its shared goals include teaching that homosexuality is
wrong, BSA directs our attention to two terms appearing in the Scout Oath and
Law. The first is the phrase “morally straight,” which appears in the Oath (“On
my honor I will do my best . . . To keep myself . . . morally straight”); the second
term is the word “clean,” which appears in a list of 12 characteristics together
constituting the Scout Law.
The Boy Scout Handbook defines “morally straight,” as such:
“To be a person of strong character, guide your life with honesty, purity, and
justice. Respect and defend the rights of all people. Your relationships with
others should be honest and open. Be clean in your speech and actions, and
faithful in your religious beliefs. The values you follow as a Scout will help you
become virtuous and self-reliant.”

The Scoutmaster Handbook emphasizes these points about being “morally
straight”:
“In any consideration of moral fitness, a key word has to be ‘courage.’ A boy’s
courage to do what his head and his heart tell him is right. And the courage to
re- fuse to do what his heart and his head say is wrong. Moral fitness, like
emotional fitness, will clearly present opportunities for wise guidance by an
alert Scoutmaster.”
As for the term “clean,” the Boy Scout Handbook offers the following:
“A Scout is CLEAN. A Scout keeps his body and mind fit and clean. He chooses
the company of those who live by these same ideals. He helps keep his home
and community clean.

Robson

The First Amendment

“You never need to be ashamed of dirt that will wash off. If you play hard and
work hard you can’t help getting dirty. But when the game is over or the work is
done, that kind of dirt disappears with soap and water. “There’s another kind of
dirt that won’t come off by washing. It is the kind that shows up in foul language
and harmful thoughts.
“Swear words, profanity, and dirty stories are weapons that ridicule other people
and hurt their feelings. The same is true of racial slurs and jokes making fun of
ethnic groups or people with physical or mental limitations. A Scout knows there
is no kindness or honor in such mean-spirited behavior. He avoids it in his own
words and deeds. He defends those who are targets of insults.” (emphasis in
original).

It is plain as the light of day that neither one of these principles—“morally
straight” and “clean”—says the slightest thing about homosexuality. Indeed,
neither term in the Boy Scouts’ Law and Oath expresses any position
whatsoever on sexual matters.
BSA’s published guidance on that topic underscores this point. Scouts, for
example, are directed to receive their sex education at home or in school, but
not from the organization: “Your parents or guardian or a sex education teacher
should give you the facts about sex that you must know.” To be sure, Scouts
are not forbidden from asking their Scoutmaster about issues of a sexual
nature, but Scoutmasters are, literally, the last person Scouts are encouraged
to ask: “If you have questions about growing up, about relationships, sex, or
making good decisions, ask. Talk with your parents, religious leaders, teachers,
or Scoutmaster.” Moreover, Scoutmasters are specifically directed to steer
curious adolescents to other sources of information:
“If Scouts ask for information regarding . . . sexual activity, answer honestly and
factually, but stay within your realm of expertise and comfort. If a Scout has
serious concerns that you cannot answer, refer him to his family, religious
leader, doctor, or other professional.”

More specifically, BSA has set forth a number of rules for Scoutmasters when
these types of issues come up:
“You may have boys asking you for information or ad- vice about sexual
matters. . . . “How should you handle such matters? “Rule number 1: You do not
undertake to instruct Scouts, in any formalized manner, in the subject of sex and
family life. The reasons are that it is not construed to be Scouting’s proper area,
and that you are probably not well qualified to do this.
“Rule number 2: If Scouts come to you to ask questions or to seek advice, you
would give it within your competence. A boy who appears to be asking about
sexual intercourse, however, may really only be worried about his pimples, so it
is well to find out just what information is needed.
“Rule number 3: You should refer boys with sexual problems to persons better
qualified than you [are] to handle them. If the boy has a spiritual leader or a
doctor who can deal with them, he should go there. If such persons are not
available, you may just have to do the best you can. But don’t try to play a
highly professional role. And at the other extreme, avoid passing the buck.”

In light of BSA’s self-proclaimed ecumenism, furthermore, it is even more
difficult to discern any shared goals or common moral stance on homosexuality.
Insofar as religious matters are concerned, BSA’s bylaws state that it is

Robson

428

The First Amendment

“absolutely nonsectarian in its attitude toward . . . religious training.” “The BSA
does not define what constitutes duty to God or the practice of religion. This is
the responsibility of parents and religious leaders.” In fact, many diverse
religious organizations sponsor local Boy Scout troops. Because a number of
religious groups do not view homosexuality as immoral or wrong and reject
discrimination against homo- sexuals,3 it is exceedingly difficult to believe that
BSA nonetheless adopts a single particular religious or moral philosophy when
it comes to sexual orientation. This is especially so in light of the fact that
Scouts are advised to seek guidance on sexual matters from their religious
leaders (and Scoutmasters are told to refer Scouts to them); BSA surely is
aware that some religions do not teach that homosexuality is wrong.
II
The Court seeks to fill the void by pointing to a statement of “policies and
procedures relating to homosexuality and Scouting,” signed by BSA’s President
and Chief Scout Executive in 1978 and addressed to the members of the
Executive Committee of the national organization. The letter says that the BSA
does “not believe that homosexuality and leadership in Scouting are
appropriate.” But when the entire 1978 letter is read, BSA’s position is far more
equivocal:
“4. Q. May an individual who openly declares himself to be a homosexual be
employed by the Boy Scouts of America as a professional or non-professional?
“A. Boy Scouts of America does not knowingly em- ploy homosexuals as
professionals or non-professionals. We are unaware of any present laws which
would prohibit this policy.
“5. Q. Should a professional or non-professional individual who openly declares
himself to be a homosexual be terminated?
“A. Yes, in the absence of any law to the contrary. At the present time we are
unaware of any statute or ordinance in the United States which prohibits
discrimination against individual’s employment upon the basis of homosexuality.
In the event that such a law was applicable, it would be necessary for the Boy
Scouts of America to obey it, in this case as in Paragraph 4 above. It is our
position, however, that homosexuality and professional or non-professional
employment in Scouting are not appropriate.”

Four aspects of the 1978 policy statement are relevant to the proper disposition
of this case. First, at most this letter simply adopts an exclusionary
membership policy. But simply adopting such a policy has never been
considered sufficient, by itself, to prevail on a right to associate claim.
Second, the 1978 policy was never publicly expressed—unlike, for example, the
Scout’s duty to be “obedient.” It was an internal memorandum, never circulated
beyond the few members of BSA’s Executive Committee. It remained, in effect, a
secret Boy Scouts policy. Far from claiming any intent to express an idea that
would be burdened by the presence of homosexuals, BSA’s public posture—to
the world and to the Scouts themselves—remained what it had always been:
one of tolerance, welcoming all classes of boys and young men. In this respect,
BSA’s claim is even weaker than those we have rejected in the past.
Third, it is apparent that the draftsmen of the policy statement foresaw the
possibility that laws against discrimination might one day be amended to

Robson

429

The First Amendment

protect homosexuals from employment discrimination. Their statement clearly
provided that, in the event such a law conflicted with their policy, a Scout’s
duty to be “obedient” and “obe[y] the laws,” even if “he thinks [the laws] are
unfair,” would prevail in such a contingency. ***
Fourth, the 1978 statement simply says that homosexuality is not “appropriate.”
It makes no effort to connect that statement to a shared goal or expressive
activity of the Boy Scouts. Whatever values BSA seeks to instill in Scouts, the
idea that homosexuality is not “appropriate” appears entirely unconnected to,
and is mentioned nowhere in, the myriad of publicly declared values and creeds
of the BSA. That idea does not appear to be among any of the principles
actually taught to Scouts. Rather, the 1978 policy appears to be no more than a
private statement of a few BSA executives that the organization wishes to
exclude gays—and that wish has nothing to do with any expression BSA
actually engages in.
The majority also relies on four other policy statements that were issued
between 1991 and 1993. All of them were written and issued after BSA revoked
Dale’s membership. Accordingly, they have little, if any, relevance to the legal
question before this Court. In any event, they do not bolster BSA’s claim.
It is clear, then, that nothing in these policy statements supports BSA’s claim.
The only policy written before the revocation of Dale’s membership was an
equivocal, undisclosed statement that evidences no connection between the
group’s discriminatory intentions and its expressive interests. The later policies
demonstrate a brief—though ultimately abandoned—attempt to tie BSA’s
exclusion to its expression, but other than a single sentence, BSA fails to show
that it ever taught Scouts that homosexuality is not “morally straight” or “clean,”
or that such a view was part of the group’s collective efforts to foster a belief.
Furthermore, BSA’s policy statements fail to establish any clear, consistent,
and unequivocal position on homosexuality. Nor did BSA have any reason to
think Dale’s sexual conduct, as opposed to his orientation, was contrary to the
group’s values.
III
BSA’s claim finds no support in our cases. We have recognized “a right to
associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First
Amendment— speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the
exercise of religion.” Roberts, 468 U.S., at 618. And we have acknowledged that
“when the State interferes with individuals’ selection of those with whom they
wish to join in a common endeavor, freedom of association . . . may be
implicated.” But “[t]he right to associate for expressive purposes is not . . .
absolute”; rather, “the nature and degree of constitutional protection afforded
freedom of association may vary depending on the extent to which . . . the
constitutionally protected liberty is at stake in a given case.” In- deed, the right
to associate does not mean “that in every setting in which individuals exercise
some discrimination in choosing associates, their selective process of inclusion
and exclusion is protected by the Constitution.” For example, we have routinely
and easily rejected assertions of this right by expressive organizations with
discriminatory membership policies, such as private schools, law firms, and
labor organizations. In fact, until today, we have never once found a claimed

Robson

430

The First Amendment

right to associate in the selection of members to prevail in the face of a State’s
anti- discrimination law. To the contrary, we have squarely held that a State’s
antidiscrimination law does not violate a group’s right to associate simply
because the law conflicts with that group’s exclusionary membership policy.
In Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984), we addressed just such a conflict.
The Jaycees was a non- profit membership organization “‘designed to inculcate
in the individual membership . . . a spirit of genuine American- ism and civic
interest, and . . . to provide . . . an avenue for intelligent participation by young
men in the affairs of their community.’” The organization was di- vided into
local chapters, described as “ ‘young men’s organization[s],’” in which regular
membership was restricted to males between the ages of 18 and 35. But
Minnesota’s Human Rights Act, which applied to the Jaycees, made it unlawful
to “‘deny any person the full and equal enjoyment of . . . a place of public
accommodation because of . . . sex.’” The Jaycees, however, claimed that
applying the law to it violated its right to associate—in particular its right to
maintain its selective membership policy.
We rejected that claim. Cautioning that the right to associate is not “absolute,”
we held that “[i]nfringements on that right may be justified by regulations
adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of
ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of
associational freedoms.” We found the State’s purpose of eliminating
discrimination is a compelling state interest that is unrelated to the
suppression of ideas. We also held that Minnesota’s law is the least restrictive
means of achieving that interest. The Jaycees had “failed to demonstrate that
the Act imposes any serious burdens on the male members’ freedom of
expressive association.” Though the Jaycees had “taken public positions on a
number of diverse issues, [and] . . . regularly engage in a variety of . . . activities
worthy of constitutional protection under the First Amendment,” there was “no
basis in the record for concluding that admission of women as full voting
members will impede the organization’s ability to engage in these protected
activities or to disseminate its preferred views.” “The Act,” we held, “requires no
change in the Jaycees’ creed of promoting the interest of young men, and it
imposes no restrictions on the organization’s ability to exclude individuals with
ideologies or philosophies different from those of its existing members.”
The evidence before this Court makes it exceptionally clear that BSA has, at
most, simply adopted an exclusionary membership policy and has no shared
goal of disapproving of homosexuality. BSA’s mission statement and federal
charter say nothing on the matter; its official membership policy is silent; its
Scout Oath and Law—and accompanying definitions—are devoid of any view on
the topic; its guidance for Scouts and Scoutmasters on sexuality declare that
such matters are “not construed to be Scouting’s proper area,” but are the
province of a Scout’s parents and pastor; and BSA’s posture respecting religion
tolerates a wide variety of views on the issue of homosexuality. Moreover, there
is simply no evidence that BSA otherwise teaches anything in this area, or that
it instructs Scouts on matters involving homosexuality in ways not conveyed in
the Boy Scout or Scoutmaster Handbooks. In short, Boy Scouts of America is
simply silent on homosexuality. There is no shared goal or collective effort to
foster a belief about homosexuality at all—let alone one that is significantly

Robson

431

The First Amendment

burdened by admitting homosexuals.
Equally important is BSA’s failure to adopt any clear position on homosexuality.
BSA’s temporary, though ultimately abandoned, view that homosexuality is
incompatible with being “morally straight” and “clean” is a far cry from the clear,
unequivocal statement necessary to prevail on its claim. Despite the solitary
sentences in the 1991 and 1992 policies, the group continued to disclaim any
single religious or moral position as a general matter and actively eschewed
teaching any lesson on sexuality. It also continued to define “morally straight”
and “clean” in the Boy Scout and Scout- master Handbooks without any
reference to homosexuality. As noted earlier, nothing in our cases suggests that
a group can prevail on a right to expressive association if it, effectively, speaks
out of both sides of its mouth. A State’s anti- discrimination law does not
impose a “serious burden” or a “substantial restraint” upon the group’s “shared
goals” if the group itself is unable to identify its own stance with any clarity.
IV
The majority pretermits this entire analysis. It finds that BSA in fact “ ‘teach[es]
that homosexual conduct is not morally straight.’ ” This conclusion, remarkably,
rests entirely on statements in BSA’s briefs. Moreover, the majority insists that
we must “give deference to an association’s assertions regarding the nature of
its expression” and “we must also give deference to an association’s view of
what would impair its expression.” ***
This is an astounding view of the law. I am unaware of any previous instance in
which our analysis of the scope of a constitutional right was determined by
looking at what a litigant asserts in his or her brief and inquiring no further. It
is even more astonishing in the First Amendment area, because, as the majority
itself acknowledges, “we are obligated to independently review the factual
record.” It is an odd form of independent review that consists of deferring
entirely to whatever a litigant claims. But the majority insists that our inquiry
must be “limited,” because “it is not the role of the courts to reject a group’s
expressed values because they disagree with those values or find them
internally inconsistent.”
But nothing in our cases calls for this Court to do any such thing. An
organization can adopt the message of its choice, and it is not this Court’s place
to disagree with it. But we must inquire whether the group is, in fact,
expressing a message (whatever it may be) and whether that message (if one is
expressed) is significantly affected by a State’s antidiscrimination law. More
critically, that inquiry requires our independent analysis, rather than deference
to a group’s litigating posture. Reflection on the subject dictates that such an
inquiry is required.
Surely there are instances in which an organization that truly aims to foster a
belief at odds with the purposes of a State’s antidiscrimination laws will have a
First Amendment right to association that precludes forced compliance with
those laws. But that right is not a freedom to discriminate at will, nor is it a
right to maintain an exclusionary membership policy simply out of fear of what
the public reaction would be if the group’s membership were opened up. It is an
implicit right designed to protect the enumerated rights of the First Amendment,
not a license to act on any discriminatory impulse. To prevail in asserting a

Robson

432

The First Amendment

right of expressive association as a defense to a charge of violating an antidiscrimination law, the organization must at least show it has adopted and
advocated an unequivocal position inconsistent with a position advocated or
epitomized by the person whom the organization seeks to exclude. If this Court
were to defer to whatever position an organization is prepared to assert in its
briefs, there would be no way to mark the proper boundary between genuine
exercises of the right to associate, on the one hand, and sham claims that are
simply at- tempts to insulate nonexpressive private discrimination, on the other
hand.
V
Even if BSA’s right to associate argument fails, it nonetheless might have a
First Amendment right to refrain from including debate and dialogue about
homosexuality as part of its mission to instill values in Scouts. It can, for
example, advise Scouts who are entering adulthood and have questions about
sex to talk “with your parents, religious leaders, teachers, or Scoutmaster,” and,
in turn, it can direct Scout- masters who are asked such questions “not
undertake to instruct Scouts, in any formalized manner, in the subject of sex
and family life” because “it is not construed to be Scouting’s proper area.”
Dale’s right to advocate certain beliefs in a public forum or in a private debate
does not include a right to advocate these ideas when he is working as a
Scoutmaster. And BSA cannot be compelled to include a message about
homosexuality among the values it actually chooses to teach its Scouts, if it
would prefer to remain silent on that subject.
In West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943), we recognized that the government
may not “requir[e] affirmation of a belief and an attitude of mind,” nor “force an
American citizen publicly to profess any statement of belief,” even if doing so
does not require the person to “forego any contrary convictions of their own.”
“[O]ne important manifestation of the principle of free speech is that one who
chooses to speak may also decide ‘what not to say.’ ” Hurley. Though the
majority mistakenly treats this statement as going to the right to associate, it
actually refers to a free speech claim. See Hurley (noting distinction between
free speech and right to associate claims). As with the right to associate claim,
though, the court is obligated to engage in an independent inquiry into whether
the mere inclusion of homosexuals would actually force BSA to proclaim a
message it does not want to send.
In its briefs, BSA implies, even if it does not directly argue, that Dale would use
his Scoutmaster position as a “bully pulpit” to convey immoral messages to his
troop, and therefore his inclusion in the group would compel BSA to include a
message it does not want to impart. Even though the majority does not endorse
that argument, I think it is important to explain why it lacks merit, before
considering the argument the majority does accept.
BSA has not contended, nor does the record support, that Dale had ever
advocated a view on homosexuality to his troop before his membership was
revoked.
Though Hurley has a superficial similarity to the present case, a close
inspection reveals a wide gulf between that case and the one before us today.

Robson

433

The First Amendment

First, it was critical to our analysis that GLIB was actually conveying a message
by participating in the parade—otherwise, the parade organizers could hardly
claim that they were being forced to include any unwanted message at all. Our
conclusion that GLIB was conveying a message was inextricably tied to the fact
that GLIB wanted to march in a parade, as well as the manner in which it
intended to march. We noted the “inherent expressiveness of marching [in a
parade] to make a point,” and in particular that GLIB was formed for the
purpose of making a particular point about gay pride. More specifically, GLIB
“distributed a fact sheet describing the members’ intentions” and, in a previous
parade, had “marched behind a shamrock-strewn banner with the simple
inscription ‘Irish American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston.’” “[A]
contingent marching behind the organization’s banner,” we said, would clearly
convey a message. Indeed, we expressly distinguished between the members of
GLIB, who marched as a unit to express their views about their own sexual
orientation, on the one hand, and homosexuals who might participate as
individuals in the parade without intending to express anything about their
sexuality by doing so.
Second, we found it relevant that GLIB’s message “would likely be perceived” as
the parade organizers’ own speech. That was so because “[p]arades and
demonstrations . . . are not understood to be so neutrally presented or
selectively viewed” as, say, a broadcast by a cable operator, who is usually
considered to be “merely ‘a conduit’ for the speech” produced by others. Rather,
parade organizers are usually understood to make the “customary
determination about a unit admitted to the parade.”
Dale’s inclusion in the Boy Scouts is nothing like the case in Hurley. His
participation sends no cognizable message to the Scouts or to the world. Unlike
GLIB, Dale did not carry a banner or a sign; he did not distribute any factsheet;
and he expressed no intent to send any message. If there is any kind of
message being sent, then, it is by the mere act of joining the Boy Scouts. Such
an act does not constitute an instance of symbolic speech under the First
Amendment.
It is true, of course, that some acts are so imbued with symbolic meaning that
they qualify as “speech” under the First Amendment. See United States v.
O’Brien (1968). At the same time, however, “[w]e cannot accept the view that an
apparently limitless variety of con- duct can be labeled ‘speech’ whenever the
person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.” Though
participating in the Scouts could itself conceivably send a message on some
level, it is not the kind of act that we have recognized as speech. Indeed, if
merely joining a group did constitute symbolic speech; and such speech were
attributable to the group being joined; and that group has the right to exclude
that speech (and hence, the right to exclude that person from joining), then the
right of free speech effectively becomes a limitless right to exclude for every
organization, whether or not it engages in any expressive activities. That cannot
be, and never has been, the law.
Furthermore, it is not likely that BSA would be understood to send any
message, either to Scouts or to the world, simply by admitting someone as a
member. Over the years, BSA has generously welcomed over 87 million young
Americans into its ranks. In 1992 over one million adults were active BSA

Robson

434

The First Amendment

members. The notion that an organization of that size and enormous prestige
implicitly endorses the views that each of those adults may express in a nonScouting context is simply mind boggling. Indeed, in this case there is no
evidence that the young Scouts in Dale’s troop, or members of their families,
were even aware of his sexual orientation, either before or after his public
statements at Rutgers University. It is equally farfetched to assert that Dale’s
open declaration of his homosexuality, reported in a local newspaper, will
effectively force BSA to send a message to anyone simply because it allows Dale
to be an Assistant Scoutmaster. For an Olympic gold medal winner or a
Wimbledon tennis champion, being “openly gay” perhaps communicates a
message—for example, that openness about one’s sexual orientation is more
virtuous than concealment; that a homosexual person can be a capable and
virtuous person who should be judged like anyone else; and that homosexuality
is not immoral— but it certainly does not follow that they necessarily send a
message on behalf of the organizations that sponsor the activities in which they
excel.***

1.
The Court in Hurley is unanimous while the Justices in Dale are
closely divided, with Justice Souter, the author of the Court’s opinion in
Hurley, joining the four dissenting Justices in Dale. (Justice Souter also
writes separately to emphasize that what one feels about homosexuality
is not pertinent). What are the distinctions the dissenters draw between
the St Patrick’s Day parade and the organization of the Boy Scouts?
Between GLIB and James Dale?
2.
Notice the analytic structure in both Hurley and Dale. First, the
plaintiffs must be engaged in speech or association that has a “message.”
Second, the person who seeks to be included must also be engaged in
speech that has a “message.” Third, those messages must be different,
so that the plaintiffs are being forced to “say” something they would not
otherwise say.

In Elane Photography LLC v. Wilcox, 309 P.3d 53 (N.M. 2013), the
New Mexico Supreme Court held that a photography company violated a
state anti-discrimination law when it refused to photograph a same-sex
wedding. The court rejected the First Amendment free speech claim of
compelled speech derived from “two lines” of cases, concluding that the
photographers were not being compelled to speak the government’s
message (as in Barnette and Wooley) or being compelled to include a
third parties’ message that would change its own (as in Hurley and Dale).

ROBERTS, C.J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH ALL OTHER MEMBERS JOINED,
EXCEPT ALITO, J., WHO TOOK NO PART IN THE CONSIDERATION OR DECISION OF THE CASE.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
When law schools began restricting the access of military recruiters to their
students because of disagreement with the Government’s policy on
homosexuals in the military, Congress responded by enacting the Solomon
Amendment. See 10 U. S. C. §983 (Supp. 2005). That provision specifies that if
any part of an institution of higher education denies military recruiters access
equal to that provided other recruiters, the entire institution would lose certain
federal funds. The law schools responded by suing, alleging that the Solomon
Amendment infringed their First Amendment freedoms of speech and
association. The District Court disagreed but was reversed by a divided panel of
the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which ordered the District Court to
enter a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Solomon Amendment.
We granted certiorari.
I
Respondent Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. (FAIR), is an
association of law schools and law faculties. Its declared mission is “to promote
academic freedom, support educational institutions in opposing discrimination
and vindicate the rights of institutions of higher education.” FAIR members
have adopted policies expressing their opposition to discrimination based on,
among other factors, sexual orientation. They would like to restrict military
recruiting on their campuses because they object to the policy Congress has
adopted with respect to homosexuals in the military. The Solomon Amendment,
however,
forces
institutions
to
choose
between
enforcing
their
nondiscrimination policy against military recruiters in this way and continuing
to receive specified federal funding.

Robson

436

The First Amendment

II
The Solomon Amendment denies federal funding to an institution of higher
education that “has a policy or practice . . . that either prohibits, or in effect
prevents” the military “from gaining access to campuses, or access to
students . . . on campuses, for purposes of military recruiting in a manner that
is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students
that is provided to any other employer.” The statute provides an exception for
an institution with “a longstanding policy of pacifism based on historical
religious affiliation.” The Government and FAIR agree on what this statute
requires: In order for a law school and its university to receive federal funding,
the law school must offer military recruiters the same access to its campus and
students that it provides to the nonmilitary recruiter receiving the most
favorable access.
III
The Constitution grants Congress the power to “provide for the common
Defence,” “[t]o raise and support Armies,” and “[t]o provide and maintain a
Navy.” Art. I, §8, cls. 1, 12–13. Congress’ power in this area “is broad and
sweeping,” and there is no dispute in this case that it includes the authority to
require campus access for military recruiters. That is, of course, unless
Congress exceeds constitutional limitations on its power in enacting such
legislation. But the fact that legislation that raises armies is subject to First
Amendment constraints does not mean that we ignore the purpose of this
legislation when determining its constitutionality; *** “judicial deference . . . is
at its apogee” when Congress legislates under its authority to raise and support
armies.
Although Congress has broad authority to legislate on matters of military
recruiting, it nonetheless chose to secure campus access for military recruiters
indirectly, through its Spending Clause power. The Solomon Amendment gives
universities a choice: Either allow military recruiters the same access to
students afforded any other recruiter or forgo certain federal funds. Congress’
decision to proceed indirectly does not reduce the deference given to Congress
in the area of military affairs. Congress’ choice to promote its goal by creating a
funding condition deserves at least as deferential treatment as if Congress had
imposed a mandate on universities.
Congress’ power to regulate military recruiting under the Solomon Amendment
is arguably greater because universities are free to decline the federal funds. In
Grove City College v. Bell (1984), we rejected a private college’s claim that
conditioning federal funds on its compliance with Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 violated the First Amendment. We thought this argument
“warrant[ed] only brief consideration” because “Congress is free to attach
reasonable and unambiguous conditions to federal financial assistance that
educational institutions are not obligated to accept.” We concluded that no First
Amendment violation had occurred—without reviewing the substance of the
First Amendment claims—because Grove City could decline the Government’s
funds.
Other decisions, however, recognize a limit on Congress’ ability to place
conditions on the receipt of funds. We recently held that “‘the government may

Robson

437

The First Amendment

not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally
protected . . . freedom of speech even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.’”
United States v. American Library Assn., Inc. (2003). Under this principle, known
as the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, the Solomon Amendment would be
unconstitutional if Congress could not directly require universities to provide
military recruiters equal access to their students.
This case does not require us to determine when a condition placed on
university funding goes beyond the “reasonable” choice offered in Grove City
and becomes an unconstitutional condition. It is clear that a funding condition
cannot be unconstitutional if it could be constitutionally imposed directly.
Because the First Amendment would not prevent Congress from directly
imposing the Solomon Amendment’s access requirement, the statute does not
place an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal funds.
A
The Solomon Amendment neither limits what law schools may say nor requires
them to say anything. Law schools remain free under the statute to express
whatever views they may have on the military’s congressionally mandated
employment policy, all the while retaining eligibility for federal funds. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 25 (Solicitor General acknowledging that law schools “could put signs
on the bulletin board next to the door, they could engage in speech, they could
help organize student protests”). As a general matter, the Solomon Amendment
regulates conduct, not speech. It affects what law schools must do—afford
equal access to military recruiters—not what they may or may not say.
Nevertheless, the Third Circuit concluded that the Solomon Amendment
violates law schools’ freedom of speech in a number of ways. First, in assisting
military recruiters, law schools provide some services, such as sending e-mails
and distributing flyers, that clearly involve speech. The Court of Appeals held
that in supplying these services law schools are unconstitutionally compelled to
speak the Government’s message. Second, military recruiters are, to some
extent, speaking while they are on campus. The Court of Appeals held that, by
forcing law schools to permit the military on campus to express its message, the
Solomon Amendment unconstitutionally requires law schools to host or
accommodate the military’s speech. Third, although the Court of Appeals
thought that the Solomon Amendment regulated speech, it held in the
alternative that, if the statute regulates conduct, this conduct is expressive and
regulating it unconstitutionally infringes law schools’ right to engage in
expressive con- duct. We consider each issue in turn.
1
Some of this Court’s leading First Amendment precedents have established the
principle that freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people
what they must say. In West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943), we held
unconstitutional a state law requiring schoolchildren to recite the Pledge of
Allegiance and to salute the flag. And in Wooley v. Maynard (1977), we held
unconstitutional another that required New Hampshire motorists to display the
state motto—“Live Free or Die”—on their license plates.
The Solomon Amendment does not require any similar expression by law

Robson

438

The First Amendment

schools. Nonetheless, recruiting assistance provided by the schools often
includes elements of speech. For example, schools may send e-mails or post
notices on bulletin boards on an employer’s behalf. Law schools offering such
services to other recruiters must also send e-mails and post notices on behalf of
the military to comply with the Solomon Amendment. As FAIR points out, these
compelled statements of fact (“The U. S. Army recruiter will meet interested
students in Room 123 at 11 a.m.”), like compelled statements of opinion, are
subject to First Amendment scrutiny.
This sort of recruiting assistance, however, is a far cry from the compelled
speech in Barnette and Wooley. The Solomon Amendment, unlike the laws at
issue in those cases, does not dictate the content of the speech at all, which is
only “compelled” if, and to the extent, the school provides such speech for other
recruiters. There is nothing in this case approaching a Government-mandated
pledge or motto that the school must endorse.
The compelled speech to which the law schools point is plainly incidental to the
Solomon Amendment’s regulation of conduct, and “it has never been deemed an
abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal
merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by
means of language, either spoken, written, or printed.” Congress, for example,
can prohibit employers from discriminating in hiring on the basis of race. The
fact that this will require an employer to take down a sign reading “White
Applicants Only” hardly means that the law should be analyzed as one
regulating the employer’s speech rather than conduct. See R. A. V. v. St. Paul,
(1992) (“[W]ords can in some circumstances violate laws directed not against
speech but against conduct”). Compelling a law school that sends scheduling emails for other recruiters to send one for a military recruiter is simply not the
same as forcing a student to pledge allegiance, or forcing a Jehovah’s Witness to
display the motto “Live Free or Die,” and it trivializes the freedom protected in
Barnette and Wooley to suggest that it is.
2
Our compelled-speech cases are not limited to the situation in which an
individual must personally speak the government’s message. We have also in a
number of instances limited the government’s ability to force one speaker to
host or accommodate another speaker’s message. ***
The compelled-speech violation in each of our prior cases, however, resulted
from the fact that the complaining speaker’s own message was affected by the
speech it was forced to accommodate. The expressive nature of a parade was
central to our holding in Hurley. We concluded that because “every
participating unit affects the message conveyed by the [parade’s] private
organizers,” a law dictating that a particular group must be included in the
parade “alter[s] the expressive content of th[e] parade.” As a result, we held that
the State’s public accommodation law, as applied to a private parade, “violates
the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker
has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.”
In this case, accommodating the military’s message does not affect the law
schools’ speech, because the schools are not speaking when they host
interviews and recruiting receptions. Unlike a parade organizer’s choice of

Robson

439

The First Amendment

parade contingents, a law school’s decision to allow recruiters on campus is not
inherently expressive. Law schools facilitate recruiting to assist their students
in obtaining jobs. A law school’s recruiting services lack the expressive quality
of a parade, a newsletter, or the editorial page of a news- paper; its
accommodation of a military recruiter’s message is not compelled speech
because the accommodation does not sufficiently interfere with any message of
the school.
The schools respond that if they treat military and nonmilitary recruiters alike
in order to comply with the Solomon Amendment, they could be viewed as
sending the message that they see nothing wrong with the military’s policies,
when they do. We rejected a similar argument in PruneYard Shopping Center v.
Robins (1980). In that case, we upheld a state law requiring a shopping center
owner to allow certain expressive activities by others on its property. We
explained that there was little likelihood that the views of those engaging in the
expressive activities would be identified with the owner, who remained free to
disassociate himself from those views and who was “not . . . being compelled to
affirm [a] belief in any governmentally prescribed position or view.”
The same is true here. Nothing about recruiting suggests that law schools agree
with any speech by recruiters, and nothing in the Solomon Amendment
restricts what the law schools may say about the military’s policies. We have
held that high school students can appreciate the difference between speech a
school sponsors and speech the school permits because legally required to do
so, pursuant to an equal access policy. Surely students have not lost that
ability by the time they get to law school.
3
Having rejected the view that the Solomon Amendment impermissibly regulates
speech, we must still consider whether the expressive nature of the conduct
regulated by the statute brings that conduct within the First Amendment’s
protection. In O’Brien, we recognized that some forms of “ ‘symbolic speech’ ”
were deserving of First Amendment protection. But we rejected the view that
“conduct can be labeled ‘speech’ whenever the person engaging in the conduct
intends thereby to express an idea.”
Instead, we have extended First
Amendment protection only to conduct that is inherently expressive. In Texas v.
Johnson (1989), for example, we applied O’Brien and held that burning the
American flag was sufficiently expressive to warrant First Amendment
protection.
Unlike flag burning, the conduct regulated by the Solomon Amendment is not
inherently expressive. Prior to the adoption of the Solomon Amendment’s equalaccess requirement, law schools “expressed” their disagreement with the
military by treating military recruiters differently from other recruiters. But
these actions were expressive only because the law schools accompanied their
conduct with speech explaining it. For example, the point of requiring military
interviews to be conducted on the undergraduate campus is not
“overwhelmingly apparent.” An observer who sees military recruiters
interviewing away from the law school has no way of knowing whether the law
school is expressing its disapproval of the military, all the law school’s interview
rooms are full, or the military recruiters decided for reasons of their own that

Robson

440

The First Amendment

they would rather interview someplace else.
The expressive component of a law school’s actions is not created by the
conduct itself but by the speech that accompanies it. The fact that such
explanatory speech is necessary is strong evidence that the conduct at issue
here is not so inherently expressive that it warrants protection under O’Brien. If
combining speech and conduct were enough to create expressive conduct, a
regulated party could always transform conduct into “speech” simply by talking
about it. For instance, if an individual announces that he intends to express his
disapproval of the Internal Revenue Service by refusing to pay his income taxes,
we would have to apply O’Brien to determine whether the Tax Code violates the
First Amendment. Neither O’Brien nor its progeny supports such a result.
Although the Third Circuit also concluded that O’Brien does not apply, it held in
the alternative that the Solomon Amendment does not pass muster under
O’Brien because the Government failed to produce evidence establishing that
the Solomon Amendment was necessary and effective. The Court of Appeals
surmised that “the military has ample resources to recruit through alternative
means,” suggesting “loan repayment programs” and “television and radio
advertisements.” As a result, the Government—according to the Third Circuit—
failed to establish that the statute’s burden on speech is no greater than
essential to furthering its interest in military recruiting.
We disagree with the Court of Appeals’ reasoning and result. We have held that
“an incidental burden on speech is no greater than is essential, and therefore is
permissible under O’Brien, so long as the neutral regulation promotes a
substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent
the regulation.” The Solomon Amendment clearly satisfies this requirement.
Military recruiting promotes the substantial Government interest in raising and
supporting the Armed Forces—an objective that would be achieved less
effectively if the military were forced to recruit on less favorable terms than
other employers. The Court of Appeals’ proposed alternative methods of
recruiting are beside the point. The issue is not whether other means of raising
an army and providing for a navy might be adequate. That is a judgment for
Congress, not the courts. It suffices that the means chosen by Congress add to
the effectiveness of military recruitment. Accordingly, even if the Solomon
Amendment were regarded as regulating expressive conduct, it would not
violate the First Amendment under O’Brien.
B
The Solomon Amendment does not violate law schools’ freedom of speech, but
the First Amendment’s protection extends beyond the right to speak. We have
recognized a First Amendment right to associate for the purpose of speaking,
which we have termed a “right of expressive association.” See, e.g., Boy Scouts
of America v. Dale (2000). The reason we have extended First Amendment
protection in this way is clear: The right to speak is often exercised most
effectively by combining one’s voice with the voices of others. See Roberts v.
United States Jaycees (1984). If the government were free to restrict individuals’
ability to join together and speak, it could essentially silence views that the
First Amendment is intended to protect.
FAIR argues that the Solomon Amendment violates law schools’ freedom of

Robson

441

The First Amendment

expressive association. According to FAIR, law schools’ ability to express their
message that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is wrong is
significantly affected by the presence of military recruiters on campus and the
schools’ obligation to assist them. Relying heavily on our decision in Dale, the
Court of Appeals agreed.
The Solomon Amendment, however, does not similarly affect a law school’s
associational rights. To comply with the statute, law schools must allow military
recruiters on campus and assist them in whatever way the school chooses to
assist other employers. Law schools therefore “associate” with military
recruiters in the sense that they interact with them. But recruiters are not part
of the law school. Recruiters are, by definition, outsiders who come onto
campus for the limited purpose of trying to hire students—not to become
members of the school’s expressive association. This distinction is critical.
Unlike the public accommodations law in Dale, the Solomon Amendment does
not force a law school “‘to accept members it does not desire.’” The law schools
say that allowing military recruiters equal access impairs their own expression
by requiring them to associate with the recruiters, but just as saying conduct is
undertaken for expressive purposes cannot make it symbolic speech, so too a
speaker cannot “erect a shield” against laws requiring access “simply by
asserting” that mere association “would impair its message.”
FAIR correctly notes that the freedom of expressive association protects more
than just a group’s membership decisions. For example, we have held laws
unconstitutional that require disclosure of membership lists for groups seeking
anonymity, Brown v. Socialist Workers ’74 Campaign Comm. (Ohio) (1982), or
impose penalties or withhold benefits based on membership in a disfavored
group, Healy v. James (1972). Although these laws did not directly interfere
with an organization’s composition, they made group membership less
attractive, raising the same First Amendment concerns about affecting the
group’s ability to express its message.
The Solomon Amendment has no similar effect on a law school’s associational
rights. Students and faculty are free to associate to voice their disapproval of
the military’s message; nothing about the statute affects the composition of the
group by making group membership less desirable. The Solomon Amendment
therefore does not violate a law school’s First Amendment rights. A military
recruiter’s mere presence on campus does not violate a law school’s right to
associate, regardless of how repugnant the law school considers the recruiter’s
message.
In this case, FAIR has attempted to stretch a number of First Amendment
doctrines well beyond the sort of activities these doctrines protect. The law
schools object to having to treat military recruiters like other recruiters, but
that regulation of conduct does not violate the First Amendment. To the extent
that the Solomon Amendment incidentally affects expression, the law schools’
effort to cast themselves as just like the schoolchildren in Barnette, the parade
organizers in Hurley, and the Boy Scouts in Dale plainly overstates the
expressive nature of their activity and the impact of the Solomon Amendment
on it, while exaggerating the reach of our First Amendment precedents.
Because Congress could require law schools to provide equal access to military

Robson

recruiters without violating the schools’ freedoms of speech or association, the
Court of Appeals erred in holding that the Solomon Amendment likely violates
the First Amendment. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Third Circuit ***.

ROBERTS, C. J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH KENNEDY, GINSBURG,

THOMAS, J., JOINED. KAGAN, J., TOOK NO PART IN THE CONSIDERATION OR DECISION OF THE
CASE.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act
of 2003 (Leadership Act) outlined a comprehensive strategy to combat the
spread of HIV/AIDS around the world. As part of that strategy, Congress
authorized the appropriation of billions of dollars to fund efforts by
nongovernmental organizations to assist in the fight. The Act imposes two
related conditions on that funding: First, no funds made available by the Act
“may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution
or sex trafficking.” And second, no funds may be used by an organization “that
does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking.” This
case concerns the second of these conditions, referred to as the Policy
Requirement. The question is whether that funding condition violates a
recipient’s First Amendment rights.
I
Congress passed the Leadership Act in 2003 after finding that HIV/AIDS had
“assumed pandemic proportions, spreading from the most severely affected
regions, sub- Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, to all corners of the world, and
leaving an unprecedented path of death and devastation.” According to
congressional findings, more than 65 million people had been infected by HIV
and more than 25 million had lost their lives, making HIV/AIDS the fourth
highest cause of death worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, AIDS had
claimed the lives of more than 19 million individuals and was projected to kill a
full quarter of the population of that area over the next decade. The disease not
only directly endangered those infected, but also increased the potential for
social and political instability and economic devastation, posing a security issue
for the entire international community.
In the Leadership Act, Congress directed the President to establish a
“comprehensive, integrated” strategy to combat HIV/AIDS around the world.
The Act sets out 29 different objectives the President’s strategy should seek to
fulfill, reflecting a multitude of approaches to the problem. The strategy must
include, among other things, plans to increase the availability of treatment for
infected individuals, prevent new infections, support the care of those affected
by the disease, promote training for physicians and other health care workers,

The First Amendment

and accelerate research on HIV/AIDS prevention methods, all while providing a
framework for cooperation with international organizations and partner
countries to further the goals of the program.
The Act “make[s] the reduction of HIV/AIDS behavioral risks a priority of all
prevention efforts.” The Act’s approach to reducing behavioral risks is multifaceted. The President’s strategy for addressing such risks must, for example,
promote abstinence, encourage monogamy, increase the availability of
condoms, promote voluntary counseling and treatment for drug users, and, as
relevant here, “educat[e] men and boys about the risks of procuring sex
commercially” as well as “promote alternative livelihoods, safety, and social
reintegration strategies for commercial sex workers.” Congress found that the
“sex industry, the trafficking of individuals into such industry, and sexual
violence” were factors in the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and determined that “it should be the policy of the United States to eradicate”
prostitution and “other sexual victimization.”
The United States has enlisted the assistance of non- governmental
organizations to help achieve the many goals of the program. Such
organizations “with experience in health care and HIV/AIDS counseling,”
Congress found, “have proven effective in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic
and can be a resource in . . . provid[ing] treatment and care for individuals
infected with HIV/AIDS.” Since 2003, Congress has authorized the
appropriation of billions of dollars for funding these organizations’ fight against
HIV/AIDS around the world.
Those funds, however, come with two conditions: First, no funds made available
to carry out the Leadership Act “may be used to promote or advocate the
legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking.” Second, no funds
made available may “provide assistance to any group or organization that does
not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking, except . . .
to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Health
Organization, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative or to any United Nations
agency.” It is this second condition—the Policy Requirement—that is at issue
here.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) are the federal agencies primarily
responsible for overseeing implementation of the Leadership Act. To enforce the
Policy Requirement, the agencies have directed that the recipient of any funding
under the Act agree in the award document that it is opposed to “prostitution
and sex trafficking because of the psychological and physical risks they pose for
women, men, and children.”
II
Respondents are a group of domestic organizations engaged in combating
HIV/AIDS overseas. In addition to substantial private funding, they receive
billions annually in financial assistance from the United States, including
under the Leadership Act. Their work includes programs aimed at limiting
injection drug use in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, preventing
mother-to-child HIV transmission in Kenya, and promoting safer sex practices
in India. Respondents fear that adopting a policy explicitly opposing

Robson

444

The First Amendment

prostitution may alienate certain host governments, and may diminish the
effectiveness of some of their programs by making it more difficult to work with
prostitutes in the fight against HIV/AIDS. They are also concerned that the
Policy Requirement may require them to censor their privately funded
discussions in publications, at conferences, and in other forums about how
best to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS among prostitutes.
In 2005, respondents Alliance for Open Society International and Pathfinder
International commenced this litigation, seeking a declaratory judgment that
the Government’s implementation of the Policy Requirement violated their First
Amendment rights. Respondents sought a preliminary injunction barring the
Government from cut- ting off their funding under the Act for the duration of
the litigation, from unilaterally terminating their cooperative agreements with
the United States, or from otherwise taking action solely on the basis of
respondents’ own privately funded speech. The District Court granted such a
preliminary injunction, and the Government appealed.
While the appeal was pending, HHS and USAID issued guidelines on how
recipients of Leadership Act funds could retain funding while working with
affiliated organizations not bound by the Policy Requirement. The guidelines
permit funding recipients to work with affiliated organizations that “engage[] in
activities inconsistent with the recipient’s opposition to the practices of
prostitution and sex trafficking” as long as the recipients retain “objective
integrity and independence from any affiliated organization.” Whether sufficient
separation exists is determined by the totality of the circumstances, including
“but not . . . limited to” (1) whether the organizations are legally separate; (2)
whether they have separate personnel; (3) whether they keep separate
accounting records; (4) the degree of separation in the organizations’ facilities;
and (5) the extent to which signs and other forms of identification distinguish
the organizations.
The Court of Appeals summarily remanded the case to the District Court to
consider whether the preliminary injunction was still appropriate in light of the
new guidelines. On remand, the District Court issued a new preliminary
injunction along the same lines as the first, and the Government renewed its
appeal.
The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that respondents had demonstrated
a likelihood of success on the merits of their First Amendment challenge under
this Court’s “unconstitutional conditions” doctrine. Under this doctrine, the
court reasoned, “the government may not place a condition on the receipt of a
benefit or subsidy that infringes upon the recipient’s constitutionally protected
rights, even if the government has no obligation to offer the benefit in the first
instance.” And a condition that compels recipients “to espouse the government’s
position” on a subject of international debate could not be squared with the
First Amendment. The court concluded that “the Policy Requirement, as
implemented by the Agencies, falls well beyond what the Supreme Court . . .
ha[s] upheld as permissible funding conditions.”
Judge Straub dissented, expressing his view that the Policy Requirement was
an “entirely rational exercise of Congress’s powers pursuant to the Spending
Clause.”

Robson

The First Amendment

We granted certiorari.
III
The Policy Requirement mandates that recipients of Leadership Act funds
explicitly agree with the Government’s policy to oppose prostitution and sex
trafficking. It is, however, a basic First Amendment principle that “freedom of
speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say.”
Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. (2006) (citing West
Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943), and Wooley v. Maynard (1977)). “At the
heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person should decide
for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression,
consideration, and adherence.” Were it enacted as a direct regulation of speech,
the Policy Requirement would plainly violate the First Amendment. The
question is whether the Government may nonetheless impose that requirement
as a condition on the receipt of federal funds.
A
The Spending Clause of the Federal Constitution grants Congress the power
“[t]o lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and
provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” Art.
I, §8, cl. 1. The Clause provides Congress broad discretion to tax and spend for
the “general Welfare,” including by funding particular state or private programs
or activities. That power includes the authority to impose limits on the use of
such funds to ensure they are used in the manner Congress intends. Rust v.
Sullivan (1991) (“Congress’ power to allocate funds for public purposes includes
an ancillary power to ensure that those funds are properly applied to the
prescribed use.”).
As a general matter, if a party objects to a condition on the receipt of federal
funding, its recourse is to decline the funds. This remains true when the
objection is that a condition may affect the recipient’s exercise of its First
Amendment rights.
At the same time, however, we have held that the Government “‘may not deny a
benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected . . .
freedom of speech even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.’” In some cases,
a funding condition can result in an unconstitutional burden on First
Amendment rights.
The dissent thinks that can only be true when the condition is not relevant to
the objectives of the program (although it has its doubts about that), or when
the condition is actually coercive, in the sense of an offer that cannot be
refused. *** Our precedents, however, are not so limited. In the present context,
the relevant distinction that has emerged from our cases is between conditions
that define the limits of the government spending program—those that specify
the activities Congress wants to subsidize—and conditions that seek to leverage
funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the program itself. The line
is hardly clear, in part because the definition of a particular program can
always be manipulated to subsume the challenged condition. We have held,
however, that “Congress cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere
definition of its program in every case, lest the First Amendment be reduced to

Robson

446

The First Amendment

a simple semantic exercise.” Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez (2001).
B
As noted, the distinction drawn in these cases—between conditions that define
the federal program and those that reach outside it—is not always self-evident.
As Justice Cardozo put it in a related context, “Definition more precise must
abide the wisdom of the future.” Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548,
591 (1937). Here, however, we are confident that the Policy Requirement falls
on the unconstitutional side of the line.
To begin, it is important to recall that the Leadership Act has two conditions
relevant here. The first— unchallenged in this litigation—prohibits Leadership
Act funds from being used “to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of
prostitution or sex trafficking.” ***
The Policy Requirement therefore must be doing something more—and it is. The
dissent views the Requirement as simply a selection criterion by which the
Government identifies organizations “who believe in its ideas to carry them to
fruition.” As an initial matter, whatever purpose the Policy Requirement serves
in selecting funding recipients, its effects go beyond selection. The Policy
Requirement is an ongoing condition on recipients’ speech and activities, a
ground for terminating a grant after selection is complete. In any event, as the
Government acknowledges, it is not simply seeking organizations that oppose
prostitution. Rather, it explains, “Congress has expressed its purpose ‘to
eradicate’ prostitution and sex trafficking, and it wants recipients to adopt a
similar stance” (emphasis added). This case is not about the Government’s
ability to enlist the assistance of those with whom it already agrees. It is about
compelling a grant recipient to adopt a particular belief as a condition of
funding.
By demanding that funding recipients adopt—as their own—the Government’s
view on an issue of public concern, the condition by its very nature affects
“protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.” Rust. A
recipient cannot avow the belief dictated by the Policy Requirement when
spending Leadership Act funds, and then turn around and assert a contrary
belief, or claim neutrality, when participating in activities on its own time and
dime. By requiring recipients to profess a specific belief, the Policy Requirement
goes beyond defining the limits of the federally funded program to defining the
recipient.
The Government contends that the affiliate guidelines, established while this
litigation was pending, save the program. Under those guidelines, funding
recipients are permitted to work with affiliated organizations that do not abide
by the condition, as long as the recipients retain “objective integrity and
independence” from the unfettered affiliates. The Government suggests the
guidelines alleviate any unconstitutional burden on the respondents’ First
Amendment rights by allowing them to either: (1) accept Leadership Act funding
and comply with Policy Requirement, but establish affiliates to communicate
contrary views on prostitution; or (2) decline funding themselves (thus
remaining free to express their own views or remain neutral), while creating
affiliates whose sole purpose is to receive and administer Leadership Act funds,
thereby “cabin[ing] the effects” of the Policy Requirement within the scope of the

Robson

447

The First Amendment

federal program.
Neither approach is sufficient. When we have noted the importance of affiliates
in this context, it has been because they allow an organization bound by a
funding condition to exercise its First Amendment rights outside the scope of
the federal program. Affiliates cannot serve that purpose when the condition is
that a funding recipient espouse a specific belief as its own. If the affiliate is
distinct from the recipient, the arrangement does not afford a means for the
recipient to express its beliefs. If the affiliate is more clearly identified with the
recipient, the recipient can express those beliefs only at the price of evident
hypocrisy. The guidelines themselves make that clear. See 45 CFR §89.3
(allowing funding recipients to work with affiliates whose conduct is
“inconsistent with the recipient’s opposition to the practices of prostitution and
sex trafficking” (emphasis added)).
The Government suggests that the Policy Requirement is necessary because,
without it, the grant of federal funds could free a recipient’s private funds “to be
used to promote prostitution or sex trafficking.” That argument assumes that
federal funding will simply supplant private funding, rather than pay for new
programs or expand existing ones. The Government offers no support for that
assumption as a general matter, or any reason to believe it is true here. ***
The Government cites but one case to support that argument, Holder v.
Humanitarian Law Project. That case concerned the quite different context of a
ban on providing material support to terrorist organizations, where the record
indicated that support for those organizations’ nonviolent operations was
funneled to support their violent activities.
Pressing its argument further, the Government contends that “if organizations
awarded federal funds to implement Leadership Act programs could at the same
time promote or affirmatively condone prostitution or sex trafficking, whether
using public or private funds, it would undermine the government’s program
and confuse its message opposing prostitution and sex trafficking.” But the
Policy Requirement goes beyond preventing recipients from using private funds
in a way that would undermine the federal program. It requires them to pledge
allegiance to the Government’s policy of eradicating prostitution. As to that, we
cannot improve upon what Justice Jackson wrote for the Court 70 years ago: “If
there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official,
high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism,
religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act
their faith therein.” Barnette.
The Policy Requirement compels as a condition of federal funding the
affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of
the Government program. In so doing, it violates the First Amendment and
cannot be sustained. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SCALIA, WITH WHOM JUSTICE THOMAS JOINS, DISSENTING.
The Leadership Act provides that “any group or organization that does not have
a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking” may not receive
Robson

448

The First Amendment

funds appropriated under the Act. This Policy Requirement is nothing more
than a means of selecting suitable agents to implement the Government’s
chosen strategy to eradicate HIV/AIDS. That is perfectly permissible under the
Constitution.
The First Amendment does not mandate a viewpoint-neutral government.
Government must choose between rival ideas and adopt some as its own:
competition over cartels, solar energy over coal, weapon development over
disarmament, and so forth. Moreover, the government may enlist the assistance
of those who believe in its ideas to carry them to fruition; and it need not enlist
for that purpose those who oppose or do not support the ideas. That seems to
me a matter of the most common common sense. For example: One of the
purposes of America’s foreign-aid programs is the fostering of good will towards
this country. If the organization Hamas—reputed to have an efficient system for
delivering welfare—were excluded from a program for the distribution of U. S.
food assistance, no one could reasonably object. And that would remain true if
Hamas were an organization of United States citizens entitled to the protection
of the Constitution. So long as the unfunded organization remains free to
engage in its activities (including anti-American propaganda) “without federal
assistance,” refusing to make use of its assistance for an enterprise to which it
is opposed does not abridge its speech. And the same is true when the rejected
organization is not affirmatively opposed to, but merely unsupportive of, the
object of the federal program, which appears to be the case here. (Respondents
do not promote prostitution, but neither do they wish to oppose it.) A federal
program to encourage healthy eating habits need not be administered by the
American Gourmet Society, which has nothing against healthy food but does
not insist upon it.
The argument is that this commonsense principle will enable the government to
discriminate against, and injure, points of view to which it is opposed. Of
course the Constitution does not prohibit government spending that
discriminates against, and injures, points of view to which the government is
opposed; every government program which takes a position on a controversial
issue does that. Anti-smoking programs injure cigar aficionados, programs
encouraging sexual abstinence injure free-love advocates, etc. The
constitutional prohibition at issue here is not a prohibition against
discriminating against or injuring opposing points of view, but the First
Amendment’s prohibition against the coercing of speech. I am frankly dubious
that a condition for eligibility to participate in a minor federal program such as
this one runs afoul of that prohibition even when the condition is irrelevant to
the goals of the program. Not every disadvantage is a coercion.
But that is not the issue before us here. Here the views that the Government
demands an applicant forswear—or that the Government insists an applicant
favor—are relevant to the program in question. The program is valid only if the
Government is entitled to disfavor the opposing view (here, advocacy of or
toleration of prostitution). And if the program can disfavor it, so can the
selection of those who are to administer the program. There is no risk that this
principle will enable the Government to discriminate arbitrarily against
positions it disfavors. It would not, for example, permit the Government to
exclude from bidding on defense contracts anyone who refuses to abjure

Robson

449

The First Amendment

prostitution. But here a central part of the Government’s HIV/AIDS strategy is
the suppression of prostitution, by which HIV is transmitted. It is entirely
reasonable to admit to participation in the program only those who believe in
that goal.
According to the Court, however, this transgresses a constitutional line between
conditions that operate inside a spending program and those that control
speech outside of it. I am at a loss to explain what this central pillar of the
Court’s opinion—this distinction that the Court itself admits is “hardly clear”
and “not always self-evident,” —has to do with the First Amendment. The
distinction was alluded to, to be sure, in Rust v. Sullivan (1991), but not as
(what the Court now makes it) an invariable requirement for First Amendment
validity. That the pro-abortion speech prohibition was limited to “inside the
program” speech was relevant in Rust because the program itself was not an
anti-abortion program. The Government remained neutral on that controversial
issue, but did not wish abortion to be promoted within its family-planningservices program. The statutory objective could not be impaired, in other words,
by “outside the program” pro-abortion speech. The purpose of the limitation
was to prevent Government funding from providing the means of pro-abortion
propaganda, which the Government did not wish (and had no constitutional
obligation) to provide. The situation here is vastly different. Elimination of
prostitution is an objective of the HIV/AIDS program, and any promotion of
prostitution— whether made inside or outside the program—does harm the
program.
Of course the most obvious manner in which the admission to a program of an
ideological opponent can frustrate the purpose of the program is by freeing up
the opponent’s funds for use in its ideological opposition. To use the Hamas
example again: Subsidizing that organization’s provision of social services
enables the money that it would otherwise use for that purpose to be used,
instead, for anti-American propaganda. Perhaps that problem does not exist in
this case since the respondents do not affirmatively promote prostitution. But
the Court’s analysis categorically rejects that justification for ideological
requirements in all cases, demanding “record indica[tion]” that “federal funding
will simply supplant private funding, rather than pay for new programs.” This
seems to me quite naive. Money is fungible. The economic reality is that when
NGOs can conduct their AIDS work on the Government’s dime, they can expend
greater resources on policies that undercut the Leadership Act. The
Government need not establish by record evidence that this will happen. To
make it a valid consideration in determining participation in federal programs,
it suffices that this is a real and obvious risk.
The Court makes a head-fake at the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, but
that doctrine is of no help. There is no case of ours in which a condition that is
relevant to a statute’s valid purpose and that is not in itself unconstitutional
(e.g., a religious-affiliation condition that violates the Establishment Clause) has
been held to violate the doctrine. Moreover, as I suggested earlier, the
contention that the condition here “coerces” respondents’ speech is on its face
implausible. Those organizations that wish to take a different tack with respect
to prostitution “are as unconstrained now as they were before the enactment of
[the Leadership Act].” As the Court acknowledges, “[a]s a general matter, if a

Robson

450

The First Amendment

party objects to a condition on the receipt of federal funding, its recourse is to
decline the funds,” and to draw on its own coffers.
The majority cannot credibly say that this speech condition is coercive, so it
does not. It pussyfoots around the lack of coercion by invalidating the
Leadership Act for “requiring recipients to profess a specific belief” and
“demanding that funding recipients adopt—as their own—the Government’s
view on an issue of public concern.” But like King Cnut’s commanding of the
tides, here the Government’s “requiring” and “demanding” have no coercive
effect. In the end, and in the circumstances of this case, “compell[ing] as a
condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief,” is no compulsion at all.
It is the reasonable price of admission to a limited government-spending
program that each organization remains free to accept or reject. ***
Ideological-commitment requirements such as the one here are quite rare; but
making the choice between competing applicants on relevant ideological
grounds is undoubtedly quite common. As far as the Constitution is concerned,
it is quite impossible to distinguish between the two. If the government cannot
demand a relevant ideological commitment as a condition of application, neither
can it distinguish between applicants on a relevant ideological ground. And that
is the real evil of today’s opinion. One can expect, in the future, frequent
challenges to the denial of government funding for relevant ideological reasons.
The Court’s opinion contains stirring quotations from cases like West Virginia
Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943), and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC
(1994). They serve only to distract attention from the elephant in the room: that
the Government is not forcing anyone to say anything. What Congress has done
here—requiring an ideological commitment relevant to the Government task at
hand—is approved by the Constitution itself. Americans need not support the
Constitution; they may be Communists or anarchists. But “[t]he Senators and
Representatives . . . , and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all
executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several
States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support [the] Constitution.” U.
S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 3. The Framers saw the wisdom of imposing affirmative
ideological commitments prerequisite to assisting in the government’s work.
And so should we.

Notes	  	  
1.
In USAID v. Alliance for Open Society, the Court explicitly
recognizes the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions in the First
Amendment free speech context. The Court articulates the “relevant
distinction” as “between conditions that define the limits of the
government spending program—those that specify the activities Congress
wants to subsidize” (which would be presumably constitutional) and
“conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the
contours of the program itself” (which could be unconstitutional. As the
Court states, this “line is hardly clear, in part because the definition of a

Robson

451

The First Amendment

particular program can always be manipulated to subsume the
challenged condition.”
If you were a Congressperson who wanted to enact a new version
of The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and
Malaria Act (Leadership Act), how might you “manipulate” a program
within the Act to “subsume” the condition of the anti-prostitution pledge?
2.
Given the inside/outside distinction in USAID, how would this
have applied if the Court had found a First Amendment violation in
Rumsfeld v. FAIR? Recall that the Solomon Amendment penalized failure
of the law school to include military recruiters as denying funding from
the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Transportation, Labor,
Health and Human Services, and Education, and the Central Intelligence
Agency and the National Nuclear Security Administration of the
Department of Energy universitywide.
3.
An “unconstitutional conditions” challenge requires government
funding and speech. A compelled speech challenge requires government
compulsion to speak, either by conveying the government’s message or
by including the speech of third parties. These doctrines can overlap
with other doctrines, including forum and time, place, or manner
doctrines discussed in the next chapter.

I.	   Historical	  Perspectives	  on	  Public	  Assembly	  and	  
Public	  Forums	  	  
Note:	  The	  Assembly	  Clause	  
Recall that the text of the First Amendment provides “Congress shall
make no law . . . . abridging . . . the right of the people peaceably to
assemble.”
The Assembly Clause has not been given a robust role in First
Amendment doctrine. Perhaps this is unsurprising given the history of
its inclusion in the text. The following is adapted from RUTHANN ROBSON,
DRESSING CONSTITUTIONALLY (2013):
When the members of the First Congress debated including the right to
assemble in what is now the First Amendment, Representative Theodore
Sedgwick of Massachusetts argued that the assembly clause was unnecessary: it
was encompassed by the speech clause; it was self-evident; it would never be
called into question; and it was derogatory to the dignity of the House of
Representatives to descend into such minutiae. In support of all his arguments,
Sedgwick contended the amendment might just as well declare “a man should
have a right to wear his hat if he pleased.”
It proved not to be the best analogy. As Representative John Page noted, just as
“a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he appeared before the face of
authority,” so too have people “been prevented from assembling together on their
lawful occasions.” This reference had tremendous resonance for the members of
the First Congress who would have understood it as alluding to William Penn’s
famous trial. A decade before Penn would receive the large land grant in America
that would become the state of Pennsylvania, Penn and his co-defendant William
Mead were prosecuted in England for “tumultuous assembly” and disturbing the
peace. They had preached outside a Quaker meeting house that had recently
been closed by Restoration regulations limiting religious dissent from the
recently re-established Church of England.
Originally a pamphlet and
purported trial transcript, The Peoples Ancient and Just Liberties Asserted, In the
Tryal of William Penn and William Mead at the Old Bailey, 22 Charles II 1670,
written by themselves, became an essential American document. It portrayed
Penn and Mead as heroes seeking their rights as Englishmen under the Magna
Carta but stymied by arbitrary officials in the King’s court.
Their hats were central to this portrait. As Quakers, Penn and Mead denied socalled “hat honor,” the male practice of doffing one’s cap to a superior including
removing one’s hat in court. The refusal of hat honor, intended to challenge
hierarchy, had become a well-known characteristic of the Quakers; a fair
number of Quakers had been beaten, jailed, whipped, or fined because of their
practice by the time of the Penn and Mead trial. Thus, this colloquy was not
surprising:
RECORDER. Do you know where you are?
PENN. Yes.
RECORDER. Do you know it is the King's Court?
PENN. I know it to be a Court, and I suppose it to be the King's Court.
RECORDER. Do you not know there is respect due to the Court?
PENN. Yes.
RECORDER. Why do you not pay it then?

Robson

454

The First Amendment

PENN. I do so.
RECORDER. Why do you not put off your hat then?
PENN. Because I do not believe that to be any respect.
RECORDER. Well, the Court sets forty marks a piece upon your heads as a fine
for your contempt of the Court.

However, shortly before this interchange, Penn and Mead had been waiting,
hatless, for their case to be called. When an official noticed their hats were off,
he ordered an officer to “put on their hats again.” Seemingly, this command
was merely for the purpose of immediately issuing the order to Penn to remove
his hat, an order the court would have known as problematic for the Quaker
William Penn. Immediately after the Recorder’s fine, Penn and Mead both
spoke:
PENN. I desire it might be observed, that we came into the Court with our hats
off (that is, taken off) and if they have been put on since, it was by order from the
Bench, and therefore not we but the Bench should be fined.
MEAD. I have a question to ask the Recorder. Am I fined also?
RECORDER. Yes.
MEAD. I desire the jury and all people to take notice of this injustice of the
recorder, who spake not to me to pull off my hat, and yet hath he put a fine upon
my head.

The court’s actions regarding the hats - - - provocative, arbitrary, and lacking
the essentials of fairness - - - set the scene for the remaining injustices of the
trial, the eventual jury acquittal, the prosecution of the jurors for that acquittal,
and the imprisonment of Penn and Mead for contempt for failure to remove their
hats.
Thus, Representative Sedgwick’s comparison of the right to wear or not wear a
hat and the right to assembly as equally trivial rights was not likely to be
accepted by those familiar with the Penn and Mead trial. Sedgwick’s motion to
strike “assembly” from the text of the First Amendment failed by a large margin.
But perhaps Sedgwick was correct. Recent constitutional doctrine tends to
support the argument that assembly is mere surplusage and the right is
encompassed by freedom of speech, although there is an argument that the
Assembly Clause should be more relevant. See John D. Inazu, The Forgotten
Freedom of Assembly, 84 TULANE LAW REVIEW 565 (2010).

WHITE [EDWARD DOUGLAS], J., DELIVERED THE OPINION FOR A UNANIMOUS COURT.
[Revised Ordinances of the City of Boston (1893), Section 66 provided:
Sec. 66. No person shall, in or upon any of the public grounds, make any public
address, discharge any cannon or firearm, expose for sale any goods, wares or
merchandise, erect or maintain any booth, stand, tent or apparatus for the
purposes of public amusement or show, except in accordance with a permit from
the mayor.

The Court held “A city ordinance providing that no person shall make any
public address in any of the public grounds of the city, ‘except in accordance
with a permit from the mayor,’ does not violate the fourteenth amendment to
the constitution of the United States.”]

Robson

The First Amendment

It is therefore conclusively determined there was no right in the plaintiff in error
to use the common except in such mode and subject to such regulations as the
legislature, in its wisdom may have deemed proper to prescribe. The fourteenth
amendment to the constitution of the United States does not destroy the power
of the states to enact police regulations as to the subjects within their control
and does not have the effect of creating a particular and personal right in the
citizen to use public property in defiance of the constitution and laws of the
state.
The assertion that, although it be conceded that the power existed in the state
or municipality to absolutely control the use of the common, the particular
ordinance in question is nevertheless void, because arbitrary and unreasonable,
in that it vests in the mayor the power to determine when he will grant a permit,
in truth, while admitting on the one hand the power to control, on the other
denies its existence. The right to absolutely exclude all right to use necessarily
includes the authority to determine under what circumstances such use may
be availed of, as the greater power contains the lesser. The finding of the court
of last resort of the state of Massachusetts, being that no particular right was
possessed by the plaintiff in error to the use of the common, is in reason,
therefore, conclusive of the controversy which the record presents, entirely
aside from the fact that the power conferred upon the chief executive officer of
the city of Boston by the ordinance in question may be fairly claimed to be a
mere administrative function vested in the mayor in order to effectuate the
purpose for which the common was maintained and by which its use was
regulated. The plaintiff in error cannot avail himself of the right granted by the
state, and yet obtain exemption from the lawful regulations to which this right
on his part was subjected by law.

ROBERTS, J. :
We granted certiorari as the case presents important questions in respect of the
asserted privilege and immunity of citizens of the United States to advocate
action pursuant to a federal statute, by distribution of printed matter and oral
discussion in peaceable assembly; and the jurisdiction of federal courts of suits
to restrain the abridgment of such privilege and immunity. The respondents
individual citizens, unincorporated labor organizations composed of such
citizens and a membership corporation, brought suit in the United States
District Court against the petitioners, the Mayor, the Director of Public Safety,
and the Chief of Police of Jersey City, New Jersey, and the Board of
Commissioners, the governing body of the city.

Robson

456

The First Amendment

The bill alleges that acting under a city ordinance forbidding the leasing of any
hall, without a permit from the Chief of Police, for a public meeting at which a
speaker shall advocate obstruction of the Government of the United States or a
state, or a change of government by other than lawful means, the petitioners,
and their subordinates, have denied respondents the right to hold lawful
meetings in Jersey City on the ground that they are Communists or Communist
organizations; that pursuant to an unlawful plan, the petitioners have caused
the eviction from the municipality of persons they considered undesirable
because of their labor organization activities, and have announced that they will
continue so to do. It further alleges that acting under an ordinance which
forbids any person to 'distribute or cause to be distributed or strewn about any
street or public place any newspapers, paper, periodical, book magazine,
circular, card or pamphlet', the petitioners have discriminated against the
respondents by prohibiting and interfering with distribution of leaflets and
pamphlets by the respondents while permitting others to distribute similar
printed matter; that pursuant to a plan and conspiracy to deny the respondents
their Constitutional rights as citizens of the United States, the petitioners have
caused respondents, and those acting with them, to be arrested for distributing
printed matter in the streets, and have caused them, and their associates, to be
carried beyond the limits of the city or to remote places therein, and have
compelled them to board ferry boats destined for New York; have, with violence
and force, interfered with the distribution of pamphlets discussing the rights of
citizens under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.; have
unlawfully searched persons coming into the city and seized printed matter in
their possession; have arrested and prosecuted respondents, and those acting
with them, for attempting to distribute such printed matter; and have
threatened that if respondents attempt to hold public meetings in the city to
discuss rights afforded by the National Labor Relations Act, they would be
arrested; and unless restrained, the petitioners will continue in their unlawful
conduct. The bill further alleges that respondents have repeatedly applied for
permits to hold public meetings in the city for the stated purpose, as required
by ordinance,1 although they do not admit the validity of the ordinance; but in
execution of a common plan and purpose, the petitioners have consistently
refused to issue any permits for meetings to be held by, or sponsored by,
respondents, and have thus prevented the holding of such meetings; that the
respondents did not, and do not, purpose to advocate the destruction or
overthrow of the government of the United States, or that of New Jersey, but
that their sole purpose is to explain to workingmen the purposes of the National
Labor Relations act, the benefits to be derived from it, and the aid which the
Committee for Industrial Organization would furnish workingmen to that end;
and all the activities in which they seek to engage in Jersey City were, and are,
to be performed peacefully, without intimidation, fraud, violence, or other
unlawful methods.
The bill charges that the suit is to redress 'the deprivation, under color of state
law, statute and ordinance, of rights privileges and immunities secured by the
Constitution of the United States and of rights secured by laws of the United
States providing for equal rights of citizens of the United States ....' It charges
that the petitioners' conduct 'is in violation of their (respondents) rights and
privileges as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.' It alleges that

Robson

457

The First Amendment

the petitioners' conduct has been 'in pursuance of an unlawful conspiracy ... to
injure oppress threaten and intimidate citizens of the United States, including
the individual plaintiffs herein, ... in the free exercise and enjoyment of the
rights and privileges secured to them by the Constitution and laws of the
United States. ...'
The bill charges that the ordinances are unconstitutional and void, or are being
enforced against respondents in an unconstitutional and discriminatory way;
and that the petitioners, as officials of the city, purporting to act under the
ordinances, have deprived respondents of the privileges of free speech and
peaceable assembly secured to them, as citizens of the United States, by the
Fourteenth Amendment ***
The question now presented is whether freedom to disseminate information
concerning the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, to assemble
peaceably for discussion of the Act, and of the opportunities and advantages
offered by it, is a privilege or immunity of a citizen of the United States secured
against State abridgment by Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment *** This is
the narrow question presented by the record, and we confine our decision to it,
without consideration of broader issues which the parties urge. The bill, the
answer and the findings fully present the question. The bill alleges, and the
findings sustain the allegation, that the respondents had no other purpose than
to inform citizens of Jersey City by speech, and by the written word, respecting
matters growing out of national legislation, the constitutionality of which this
court has sustained.
Although it has been held that the Fourteenth Amendment created no rights in
citizens of the United States, but merely secured existing rights against state
abridgment, it is clear that the right peaceably to assemble and to discuss these
topics, and to communicate respecting them, whether orally or in writing, is a
privilege inherent in citizenship of the United States which the Amendment
protects. ***
We have no occasion to determine whether, on the facts disclosed, the Davis
Case [Davis v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1897)] was rightly decided, but
we cannot agree that it rules the instant case. Wherever the title of streets and
parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the
public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly,
communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.
Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part
of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens. The privilege of a
citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for communication of
views on national questions may be regulated in the interest of all; it is not
absolute, but relative, and must be exercised in subordination to the general
comfort and convenience, and in consonance with peace and good order; but it
must not, in the guise of regulation, be abridged or denied.
We think the court below was right in holding the ordinance *** void upon its
face. It does not make comfort or convenience in the use of streets or parks the
standard of official action. It enables the Director of Safety to refuse a permit on
his mere opinion that such refusal will prevent ‘riots, disturbances or disorderly
assemblage.’ It can thus, as the record discloses, be made the instrument of

Robson

458

The First Amendment

arbitrary suppression of free expression of views on national affairs for the
prohibition of all speaking will undoubtedly ‘prevent’ such eventualities. But
uncontrolled official suppression of the privilege cannot be made a substitute
for the duty to maintain order in connection with the exercise of the right.
MR. JUSTICE STONE.
I do not doubt that the decree below, modified as has been proposed, is rightly
affirmed, but I am unable to follow the path by which some of my brethren have
attained that end, and I think the matter is of sufficient importance to merit
discussion in some detail.
It has been explicitly and repeatedly affirmed by this Court, without a
dissenting voice, that freedom of speech and of assembly for any lawful purpose
are rights of personal liberty secured to all persons, without regard to
citizenship, by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Gitlow v.
New York (1925); Whitney v. California (1927) *** . It has never been held that
either is a privilege or immunity peculiar to citizenship of the United States, to
which alone the privileges and immunities clause refers, and neither can be
brought within the protection of that clause without enlarging the category of
privileges and immunities of United States citizenship as it has hitherto been
defined. ***
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER, DISSENTING.
I am of opinion that the challenged ordinance is not void on its face; that in
principle it does not differ from the Boston ordinance, as applied and upheld by
this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice White, in Davis v. Massachusetts,
affirming the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, speaking through Mr.
Justice Holmes, in Commonwealth v. Davis, and that the decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals should be reversed.

Notes	  
1.
Much of the disagreement in Hague v. CIO concerns jurisdictional
issues that intersect with whether the First Amendment is applicable to
the states through the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities
Clause (as in Justice Roberts’s plurality opinion) or the Due Process
Clause (as in Justice Stone’s opinion). It is Justice Stone’s opinion,
citing cases such as Gitlow and Whitney that had previously found the
First Amendment applicable to the states through the Due Process
Clause, that remains consistent with current doctrine.
Writing for the Court in an opinion soon after Hague, Justice
Roberts noted that

Robson

This court has characterized the freedom of speech and that of the press as
fundamental personal rights and liberties. The phrase is not an empty one and
was not lightly used. It reflects the belief of the framers of the Constitution that
exercise of the rights lies at the foundation of free government by free men. It
stresses, as do many opinions of this court, the importance of preventing the
restriction of enjoyment of these liberties.

Robson

460

The First Amendment

The issue in this case is whether First Amendment rights were abridged when
respondents denied petitioner the use of a municipal facility in Chattanooga,
Tenn., for the showing of the controversial rock musical "Hair." It is established,
of course, that the Fourteenth Amendment has made applicable to the States
the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
I
Petitioner, Southeastern Promotions, Ltd., is a New York corporation engaged in
the business of promoting and presenting theatrical productions for profit. On
October 29, 1971, it applied for the use of the Tivoli, a privately owned
Chattanooga theater under long-term lease to the city, to present "Hair" there
for six days beginning November 23. This was to be a road company showing of
the musical that had played for three years on Broadway, and had appeared in
over 140 cities in the United States.
Respondents are the directors of the Chattanooga Memorial Auditorium, a
municipal theater. Shortly after receiving Southeastern's application, the
directors met, and, after a brief discussion, voted to reject it. None of them had
seen the play or read the script, but they understood from outside reports that
the musical, as produced elsewhere, involved nudity and obscenity on stage.
Although no conflicting engagement was scheduled for the Tivoli, respondents
determined that the production would not be "in the best interest of the
community." Southeastern was so notified but no written statement of reasons
was provided.
On November 1 petitioner, alleging that respondents' action abridged its First
Amendment rights, sought a preliminary injunction from the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Respondents did not then
file an answer to the complaint. A hearing was held on November 4. The District
Court took evidence as to the play's content, and respondent Conrad gave the
following account of the board's decision:
"We use the general terminology in turning down the request for its use that we
felt it was not in the best interest of the community and I can't speak beyond
that. That was the board's determination.
"Now, I would have to speak for myself, the policy to which I would refer, as I
mentioned, basically indicates that we will, as a board, allow those productions
which are clean and healthful and culturally uplifting, or words to that effect.
They are quoted in the original dedication booklet of the Memorial Auditorium."

The court denied preliminary relief, concluding that petitioner had failed to
show that it would be irreparably harmed pending a final judgment since
scheduling was "purely a matter of financial loss or gain" and was compensable.
Southeastern some weeks later pressed for a permanent injunction permitting it
to use the larger auditorium, rather than the Tivoli, on Sunday, April 9, 1972.
The District Court held three days of hearings beginning April 3. On the issue of
obscenity vel non, presented to an advisory jury, it took evidence consisting of
the full script and libretto, with production notes and stage instructions, a
recording of the musical numbers, a souvenir program, and the testimony of
seven witnesses who had seen the production elsewhere. The jury returned a
verdict that "Hair" was obscene. The District Court agreed. It concluded that
conduct in the production - group nudity and simulated sex - would violate city

Robson

461

The First Amendment

ordinances and state statutes 5 making public nudity and obscene acts
criminal offenses. This criminal conduct, the court reasoned, was neither
speech nor symbolic speech, and was to be viewed separately from the
musical's speech elements. Being pure conduct, comparable to rape or murder,
it was not entitled to First Amendment protection. Accordingly, the court denied
the injunction.
On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, by a divided
vote, affirmed. The majority relied primarily on the lower court's reasoning.
Neither the judges of the Court of Appeals nor the District Court saw the
musical performed. Because of the First Amendment overtones, we granted
certiorari.
Petitioner urges reversal on the grounds that (1) respondents' action constituted
an unlawful prior restraint, (2) the courts below applied an incorrect standard
for the determination of the issue of obscenity vel non, and (3) the record does
not support a finding that "Hair" is obscene. We do not reach the latter two
contentions, for we agree with the first. We hold that respondents' rejection of
petitioner's application to use this public forum accomplished a prior restraint
under a system lacking in constitutionally required minimal procedural
safeguards. Accordingly, on this narrow ground, we reverse.
II
Respondents' action here is indistinguishable in its censoring effect from the
official actions consistently identified as prior restraints in a long line of this
Court's decisions. In these cases, the plaintiffs asked the courts to provide relief
where public officials had forbidden the plaintiffs the use of public places to say
what they wanted to say. The restraints took a variety of forms, with officials
exercising control over different kinds of public places under the authority of
particular statutes. All, however, had this in common: they gave public officials
the power to deny use of a forum in advance of actual expression.
Invariably, the Court has felt obliged to condemn systems in which the exercise
of such authority was not bounded by precise and clear standards. The
reasoning has been, simply, that the danger of censorship and of abridgment of
our precious First Amendment freedoms is too great where officials have
unbridled discretion over a forum's use. Our distaste for censorship - reflecting
the natural distaste of a free people - is deep-written in our law.
*** In Hague v. CIO (1939) a Jersey City ordinance that forbade public assembly
in the streets or parks without a permit from the local director of safety, who
was empowered to refuse the permit upon his opinion that he would thereby
prevent "`riots, disturbances or disorderly assemblage,'" was held void on its
face. (opinion of Roberts, J.).
In Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940) a unanimous Court held invalid an act which
proscribed the solicitation of money or any valuable thing for "any alleged
religious, charitable or philanthropic cause" unless that cause was approved by
the secretary of the public welfare council. ***
The elements of prior restraint identified in Cantwell and other cases were
clearly present in the system by which the Chattanooga board regulated the use
Robson

462

The First Amendment

of its theaters. One seeking to use a theater was required to apply to the board.
The board was empowered to determine whether the applicant should be
granted permission - in effect, a license or permit - on the basis of its review of
the content of the proposed production. Approval of the application depended
upon the board's affirmative action. Approval was not a matter of routine;
instead, it involved the "appraisal of facts, the exercise of judgment, and the
formation of an opinion" by the board.
The board's judgment effectively kept the musical off stage. Respondents did
not permit the show to go on and rely on law enforcement authorities to
prosecute for anything illegal that occurred. Rather, they denied the application
in anticipation that the production would violate the law. See New York Times
Co. v. United States (1971) (White, J., concurring).
Respondents' action was no less a prior restraint because the public facilities
under their control happened to be municipal theaters. The Memorial
Auditorium and the Tivoli were public forums designed for and dedicated to
expressive activities. There was no question as to the usefulness of either
facility for petitioner's production. There was no contention by the board that
these facilities could not accommodate a production of this size. None of the
circumstances qualifying as an established exception to the doctrine of prior
restraint was present. Petitioner was not seeking to use a facility primarily
serving a competing use. Nor was rejection of the application based on any
regulation of time, place, or manner related to the nature of the facility or
applications from other users. No rights of individuals in surrounding areas
were violated by noise or any other aspect of the production. There was no
captive audience.
Whether petitioner might have used some other, privately owned, theater in the
city for the production is of no consequence. There is reason to doubt on this
record whether any other facility would have served as well as these, since none
apparently had the seating capacity, acoustical features, stage equipment, and
electrical service that the show required. Even if a privately owned forum had
been available, that fact alone would not justify an otherwise impermissible
prior restraint. ***
Only if we were to conclude that live drama is unprotected by the First
Amendment - or subject to a totally different standard from that applied to
other forms of expression - could we possibly find no prior restraint here. Each
medium of expression, of course, must be assessed for First Amendment
purposes by standards suited to it, for each may present its own problems. By
its nature, theater usually is the acting out - or singing out - of the written word,
and frequently mixes speech with live action or conduct. But that is no reason
to hold theater subject to a drastically different standard. ***
III
Labeling respondents' action a prior restraint does not end the inquiry. Prior
restraints are not unconstitutional per se. See Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson,
(1931) [Chapter 4]. ***
Any system of prior restraint, however, "comes to this Court bearing a heavy
presumption against its constitutional validity." New York Times Co. v. United

Robson

463

The First Amendment

States; Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson. The presumption against prior restraints
is heavier - and the degree of protection broader - than that against limits on
expression imposed by criminal penalties. Behind the distinction is a theory
deeply etched in our law: a free society prefers to punish the few who abuse
rights of speech after they break the law than to throttle them and all others
beforehand. It is always difficult to know in advance what an individual will say,
and the line between legitimate and illegitimate speech is often so finely drawn
that the risks of freewheeling censorship are formidable.
In order to be held lawful, respondents' action, first, must fit within one of the
narrowly defined exceptions to the prohibition against prior restraints, and,
second, must have been accomplished with procedural safeguards that reduce
the danger of suppressing constitutionally protected speech. We do not decide
whether the performance of "Hair" fits within such an exception or whether, as
a substantive matter, the board's standard for resolving that question was
correct, for we conclude that the standard, whatever it may have been, was not
implemented by the board under a system with appropriate and necessary
procedural safeguards.
*** [A] system of prior restraint runs afoul of the First Amendment if it lacks
certain safeguards: First, the burden of instituting judicial proceedings, and of
proving that the material is unprotected, must rest on the censor. Second, any
restraint prior to judicial review can be imposed only for a specified brief period
and only for the purpose of preserving the status quo. Third, a prompt final
judicial determination must be assured.
*** If a scheme that restricts access to the mails must furnish the procedural
safeguards set forth in Freedman v. Maryland (1965), no less must be expected
of a system that regulates use of a public forum. Respondents here had the
same powers of licensing and censorship exercised by postal officials in Blount v.
Rizzi (1971)and by boards and officials in other cases.
The theory underlying the requirement of safeguards is applicable here with
equal if not greater force. An administrative board assigned to screening stage
productions - and keeping off stage anything not deemed culturally uplifting or
healthful may well be less responsive than a court, an independent branch of
government, to constitutionally protected interests in free expression. 10 And if
judicial review is made unduly onerous, by reason of delay or otherwise, the
board's determination in practice may be final.
*** The perils of prior restraint are well illustrated by this case, where neither
the Board nor the lower courts could have known precisely the extent of nudity
or simulated sex in the musical, or even that either would appear, before the
play was actually performed.
Procedural safeguards were lacking here in several respects. The board's system
did not provide a procedure for prompt judicial review. Although the District
Court commendably held a hearing on petitioner's motion for a preliminary
injunction within a few days of the board's decision, it did not review the merits
of the decision at that time. The question at the hearing was whether petitioner
should receive preliminary relief. i.e., whether there was likelihood of success
on the merits and whether petitioner would suffer irreparable injury pending
full review. Effective review on the merits was not obtained until more than five

Robson

464

The First Amendment

months later. Throughout, it was petitioner, not the board, that bore the
burden of obtaining judicial review. It was petitioner that had the burden of
persuasion at the preliminary hearing if not at the later stages of the litigation.
Respondents did not file a formal answer to the complaint for five months after
petitioner sought review. During the time prior to judicial determination, the
restraint altered the status quo. Petitioner was forced to forgo the initial dates
planned for the engagement and to seek to schedule the performance at a later
date. The delay and uncertainty inevitably discouraged use of the forum.
The procedural shortcomings that form the basis for our decision are unrelated
to the standard that the board applied. Whatever the reasons may have been for
the board's exclusion of the musical, it could not escape the obligation to afford
appropriate procedural safeguards. We need not decide whether the standard of
obscenity applied by respondents or the courts below was sufficiently precise or
substantively correct, or whether the production is in fact obscene. The
standard, whatever it may be, must be implemented under a system that
assures prompt judicial review with a minimal restriction of First Amendment
rights necessary under the circumstances.
Reversed.
JUSTICE DOUGLAS, DISSENTING IN PART AND CONCURRING IN THE RESULT IN PART.
While I agree with the Court's conclusion that the actions of the respondents
constituted an impermissible prior restraint upon the performance of
petitioner's rock musical, I am compelled to write separately in order to
emphasize my view that the injuries inflicted upon petitioner's First
Amendment rights cannot be treated adequately or averted in the future by the
simple application of a few procedural band-aids. The critical flaw in this case
lies, not in the absence of procedural safeguards, but rather in the very nature
of the content screening in which respondents have engaged.
*** A municipal theater is no less a forum for the expression of ideas than is a
public park, or a sidewalk; the forms of expression adopted in such a forum
may be more expensive and more structured than those typically seen in our
parks and streets, but they are surely no less entitled to the shelter of the First
Amendment. As soon as municipal officials are permitted to pick and choose, as
they are in all existing socialist regimes, between those productions which are
"clean and healthful and culturally uplifting" in content and those which are
not, the path is cleared for a regime of censorship under which full voice can be
given only to those views which meet with the approval of the powers that be.
There was much testimony in the District Court concerning the pungent social
and political commentary which the musical "Hair" levels against various sacred
cows of our society: the Vietnam war, the draft, and the puritanical conventions
of the Establishment. This commentary is undoubtedly offensive to some, but
its contribution to social consciousness and intellectual ferment is a positive
one. In this respect, the musical's often ribald humor and trenchant social
satire may someday merit comparison to the most highly regarded works of
Aristophanes, a fellow debunker of established tastes and received wisdom, yet
one whose offerings would doubtless meet with a similarly cold reception at the

Robson

465

The First Amendment

hands of Establishment censors. No matter how many procedural safeguards
may be imposed, any system which permits governmental officials to inhibit or
control the flow of disturbing and unwelcome ideas to the public threatens
serious diminution of the breadth and richness of our cultural offerings.
JUSTICE WHITE, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE JOINS, DISSENTING.
*** The Court asserts that "Hair" contains a nude scene and that this is "the
most controversial portion" of the musical. This almost completely ignores the
District Court's description of the play as involving not only nudity but repeated
"simulated acts of anal intercourse, frontal intercourse, heterosexual
intercourse, homosexual intercourse, and group intercourse . . . ."
Given this description of "Hair," the First Amendment in my view does not
compel municipal authorities to permit production of the play in municipal
facilities. Whether or not a production as described by the District Court is
obscene and may be forbidden to adult audiences, it is apparent to me that the
State of Tennessee could constitutionally forbid exhibition of the musical to
children, and that Chattanooga may reserve its auditorium for productions
suitable for exhibition to all the citizens of the city, adults and children alike.
"Hair" does not qualify in this respect, and without holding otherwise, it is
improvident for the Court to mandate the showing of "Hair" in the Chattanooga
auditorium.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, DISSENTING.
The Court treats this case as if it were on all fours with Freedman v. Maryland,
(1965), which it is not. Freedman dealt with the efforts of the State of Maryland
to prohibit the petitioner in that case from showing a film "at his Baltimore
theater.” Petitioner here did not seek to show the musical production "Hair" at
its Chattanooga theater, but rather at a Chattanooga theater owned by the city
of Chattanooga.
The Court glosses over this distinction by treating a community-owned theater
as if it were the same as a city park or city street, which it is not. The Court's
decisions have recognized that city streets and parks are traditionally open to
the public, and that permits or licenses to use them are not ordinarily required.
"[O]ne who is rightfully on a street which the state has left open to the public
carries with him there as elsewhere the constitutional right to express his views
in an orderly fashion. This right extends to the communication of ideas by
handbills and literature as well as by the spoken word." The Court has therefore
held that where municipal authorities seek to exact a license or permit for those
who wish to use parks or streets for the purpose of exercising their right of free
speech, the standards governing the licensing authority must be objective,
definite, and nondiscriminatory. But until this case the Court has not equated a
public auditorium, which must of necessity schedule performances by a process
of inclusion and exclusion, with public streets and parks.
*** The Court *** [insists] that the municipal auditorium and the theater were
"public forums designed for and dedicated to expressive activities," and that the
rejection of petitioner's application was not based on "any regulation of time,
place, or manner related to the nature of the facility or applications from other
users." But the apparent effect of the Court's decision is to tell the managers of

Robson

466

The First Amendment

municipal auditoriums that they may exercise no selective role whatsoever in
deciding what performances may be booked. The auditoriums in question here
have historically been devoted to "clean, healthful entertainment"; they have
accepted only productions not inappropriate for viewing by children so that the
facilities might serve as a place for entertaining the whole family. Viewed apart
from any constitutional limitations, such a policy would undoubtedly rule out
much worthwhile adult entertainment. But if it is the desire of the citizens of
Chattanooga, who presumably have paid for and own the facilities, that the
attractions to be shown there should not be of the kind which would offend any
substantial number of potential theatergoers, I do not think the policy can be
described as arbitrary or unreasonable. Whether or not the production of the
version of "Hair" here under consideration is obscene, the findings of fact made
by the District Court and affirmed on appeal do indicate that it is not
entertainment designed for the whole family.
If every municipal theater or auditorium which is "designed for and dedicated to
expressive activities" becomes subject to the rule enunciated by the Court in
this case, consequences unforeseen and perhaps undesired by the Court may
well ensue. May an opera house limit its productions to operas, or must it also
show rock musicals? May a municipal theater devote an entire season to
Shakespeare, or is it required to book any potential producer on a first come,
first served basis? These questions are real ones in light of the Court's opinion,
which by its terms seems to give no constitutionally permissible role in the way
of selection to the municipal authorities.
But these substantive aspects of the Court's opinion are no more troubling than
the farrago of procedural requirements with which it has saddled municipal
authorities. ***

MARSHALL, POWELL, AND STEVENS, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE WHITE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Perry Education Association is the duly elected exclusive bargaining
representative for the teachers of the Metropolitan School District of Perry
Township, Ind. A collective-bargaining agreement with the Board of Education
provided that Perry Education Association, but no other union, would have
access to the interschool mail system and teacher mail-boxes in the Perry
Township schools. The issue in this case is whether the denial of similar access
to the Perry Local Educators' Association, a rival teacher group, violates the
First and Fourteenth Amendments.
I

Robson

467

The First Amendment

The Metropolitan School District of Perry Township, Ind., operates a public
school system of 13 separate schools. Each school building contains a set of
mailboxes for the teachers. Interschool delivery by school employees permits
messages to be delivered rapidly to teachers in the District. The primary
function of this internal mail system is to transmit official messages among the
teachers and between the teachers and the school administration. In addition,
teachers use the system to send personal messages, and individual school
building principals have allowed delivery of messages from various private
organization.
Prior to 1977, both the Perry Education Association (PEA) and the Perry Local
Educators' Association (PLEA) represented teachers in the School District and
apparently had equal access to the interschool mail system. In 1977, PLEA
challenged PEA's status as de facto bargaining representative for the Perry
Township teachers by filing an election petition with the Indiana Education
Employment Relations Board (Board). PEA won the election and was certified as
the exclusive representative, as provided by Indiana law.
The Board permits a school district to provide access to communication
facilities to the union selected for the discharge of the exclusive representative
duties of representing the bargaining unit and its individual members without
having to provide equal access to rival unions. Following the election, PEA and
the School District negotiated a labor contract in which the School Board gave
PEA "access to teachers' mailboxes in which to insert material" and the right to
use the interschool mail delivery system to the extent that the School District
incurred no extra expense by such use. The labor agreement noted that these
access rights were being accorded to PEA "acting as the representative of the
teachers" and went on to stipulate that these access rights shall not be granted
to any other "school employee organization" - a term of art defined by Indiana
law to mean "any organization which has school employees as members and
one of whose primary purposes is representing school employees in dealing with
their school employer." The PEA contract with these provisions was renewed in
1980 and is presently in force.
The exclusive-access policy applies only to use of the mail-boxes and school
mail system. PLEA is not prevented from using other school facilities to
communicate with teachers. PLEA may post notices on school bulletin boards;
may hold meetings on school property after school hours; and may, with
approval of the building principals, make announcements on the public address
system. Of course, PLEA also may communicate with teachers by word of
mouth, telephone, or the United States mail. Moreover, under Indiana law, the
preferential access of the bargaining agent may continue only while its status
as exclusive representative is insulated from challenge. While a representation
contest is in progress, unions must be afforded equal access to such
communication facilities.
PLEA and two of its members filed this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 against
PEA and individual members of the Perry Township School Board. Plaintiffs
contended that PEA's preferential access to the internal mail system violates the
First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief and damages. Upon

Robson

468

The First Amendment

cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court entered judgment for
the defendants.
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. The court held that once
the School District "opens its internal mail system to PEA but denies it to PLEA,
it violates both the Equal Protection Clause and the First Amendment." It
acknowledged that PEA had "legal duties to the teachers that PLEA does not
have" but reasoned that "[w]ithout an independent reason why equal access for
other labor groups and individual teachers is undesirable, the special duties of
the incumbent do not justify opening the system to the incumbent alone."
PEA now seeks review of this judgment by way of appeal. We postponed
consideration of our jurisdiction to the hearing of the case on the merits.
II
[The Court discussed the jurisdictional issue]. Nevertheless, the decision below
is subject to our review by writ of certiorari. The constitutional issues presented
are important and the decision below conflicts with the judgment of other
federal and state courts. Therefore, regarding PEA's jurisdictional statement as
a petition for a writ of certiorari, we grant certiorari.
III
The primary question presented is whether the First Amendment, applicable to
the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, is violated when a union
that has been elected by public school teachers as their exclusive bargaining
representative is granted access to certain means of communication, while such
access is denied to a rival union. There is no question that constitutional
interests are implicated by denying PLEA use of the interschool mail system. "It
can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional
rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate." Tinker v.
Des Moines School District (1969). The First Amendment's guarantee of free
speech applies to teacher's mailboxes as surely as it does elsewhere within the
school, Tinker and on sidewalks outside. But this is not to say that the First
Amendment requires equivalent access to all parts of a school building in which
some form of communicative activity occurs. *** The existence of a right of
access to public property and the standard by which limitations upon such a
right must be evaluated differ depending on the character of the property at
issue.
A
In places which by long tradition or by government fiat have been devoted to
assembly and debate, the rights of the State to limit expressive activity are
sharply circumscribed. At one end of the spectrum are streets and parks which
"have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of
mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts
between citizens, and discussing public questions." Hague v. CIO (1939). In
these quintessential public forums, the government may not prohibit all
communicative activity. For the State to enforce a content-based exclusion it

Robson

469

The First Amendment

must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest
and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end. The State may also enforce
regulations of the time, place, and manner of expression which are contentneutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and
leave open ample alternative channels of communication.
A second category consists of public property which the State has opened for
use by the public as a place for expressive activity. The Constitution forbids a
State to enforce certain exclusions from a forum generally open to the public
even if it was not required to create the forum in the first place. Although a
State is not required to indefinitely retain the open character of the facility, as
long as it does so it is bound by the same standards as apply in a traditional
public forum. Reasonable time, place, and manner regulations are permissible,
and a content-based prohibition must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a
compelling state interest.
Public property which is not by tradition or designation a forum for public
communication is governed by different standards. We have recognized that the
"First Amendment does not guarantee access to property simply because it is
owned or controlled by the government." In addition to time, place, and manner
regulations, the State may reserve the forum for its intended purposes,
communicative or otherwise, as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable
and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose
the speaker's view. As we have stated on several occasions, “[t]he State, no less
than a private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its
control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.”
The school mail facilities at issue here fall within this third category. The Court
of Appeals recognized that Perry School District's interschool mail system is not
a traditional public forum: "We do not hold that a school's internal mail system
is a public forum in the sense that a school board may not close it to all but
official business if it chooses." On this point the parties agree. Nor do the
parties dispute that, as the District Court observed, the "normal and intended
function [of the school mail facilities] is to facilitate internal communication of
school-related matters to the teachers." The internal mail system, at least by
policy, is not held open to the general public. It is instead PLEA's position that
the school mail facilities have become a "limited public forum" from which it
may not be excluded because of the periodic use of the system by private nonschool-connected groups, and PLEA's own unrestricted access to the system
prior to PEA's certification as exclusive representative.
Neither of these arguments is persuasive. The use of the internal school mail by
groups not affiliated with the schools is no doubt a relevant consideration. If by
policy or by practice the Perry School District has opened its mail system for
indiscriminate use by the general public, then PLEA could justifiably argue a
public forum has been created. This, however, is not the case. As the case
comes before us, there is no indication in the record that the school mailboxes
and interschool delivery system are open for use by the general public.
Permission to use the system to communicate with teachers must be secured
from the individual building principal. There is no court finding or evidence in
the record which demonstrates that this permission has been granted as a
matter of course to all who seek to distribute material. We can only conclude

Robson

470

The First Amendment

that the schools do allow some outside organizations such as the YMCA, Cub
Scouts, and other civic and church organizations to use the facilities. This type
of selective access does not transform government property into a public forum.
***
Moreover, even if we assume that by granting access to the Cub Scouts, YMCA's,
and parochial schools, the School District has created a "limited" public forum,
the constitutional right of access would in any event extend only to other
entities of similar character. While the school mail facilities thus might be a
forum generally open for use by the Girl Scouts, the local boys' club, and other
organizations that engage in activities of interest and educational relevance to
students, they would not as a consequence be open to an organization such as
PLEA, which is concerned with the terms and conditions of teacher employment.
PLEA also points to its ability to use the school mailboxes and delivery system
on an equal footing with PEA prior to the collective-bargaining agreement
signed in 1978. Its argument appears to be that the access policy in effect at
that time converted the school mail facilities into a limited public forum
generally open for use by employee organizations, and that once this occurred,
exclusions of employee organizations thereafter must be judged by the
constitutional standard applicable to public forums. The fallacy in the
argument is that it is not the forum, but PLEA itself, which has changed. Prior
to 1977, there was no exclusive representative for the Perry School District
teachers. PEA and PLEA each represented its own members. Therefore the
School District's policy of allowing both organizations to use the school mail
facilities simply reflected the fact that both unions represented the teachers and
had legitimate reasons for use of the system. PLEA's previous access was
consistent with the School District's preservation of the facilities for schoolrelated business, and did not constitute creation of a public forum in any
broader sense.
Because the school mail system is not a public forum, the School District had
no "constitutional obligation per se to let any organization use the school mail
boxes." In the Court of Appeals' view, however, the access policy adopted by the
Perry schools favors a particular viewpoint, that of PEA, on labor relations, and
consequently must be strictly scrutinized regardless of whether a public forum
is involved. There is, however, no indication that the School Board intended to
discourage one viewpoint and advance another. We believe it is more accurate
to characterize the access policy as based on the status of the respective unions
rather than their views. Implicit in the concept of the nonpublic forum is the
right to make distinctions in access on the basis of subject matter and speaker
identity. These distinctions may be impermissible in a public forum but are
inherent and inescapable in the process of limiting a nonpublic forum to
activities compatible with the intended purpose of the property. The touchstone
for evaluating these distinctions is whether they are reasonable in light of the
purpose which the forum at issue serves.
B
The differential access provided PEA and PLEA is reasonable because it is
wholly consistent with the District's legitimate interest in "preserv[ing] the

Robson

471

The First Amendment

property . . . for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated." Use of school mail
facilities enables PEA to perform effectively its obligations as exclusive
representative of all Perry Township teachers. Conversely, PLEA does not have
any official responsibility in connection with the School District and need not be
entitled to the same rights of access to school mailboxes. We observe that
providing exclusive access to recognized bargaining representatives is a
permissible labor practice in the public sector. We have previously noted that
the "designation of a union as exclusive representative carries with it great
responsibilities. The tasks of negotiating and administering a collectivebargaining agreement and representing the interests of employees in settling
disputes and processing grievances are continuing and difficult ones." Abood v.
Detroit Bd. of Ed. (1977). Moreover, exclusion of the rival union may reasonably
be considered a means of insuring labor peace within the schools. The policy
“serves to prevent the District's schools from becoming a battlefield for interunion squabbles.”
The Court of Appeals accorded little or no weight to PEA's special
responsibilities. In its view these responsibilities, while justifying PEA's access,
did not justify denying equal access to PLEA. The Court of Appeals would have
been correct if a public forum were involved here. But the internal mail system
is not a public forum. As we have already stressed, when government property
is not dedicated to open communication the government may - without further
justification - restrict use to those who participate in the forum's official
business.
Finally, the reasonableness of the limitations on PLEA's access to the school
mail system is also supported by the substantial alternative channels that
remain open for union-teacher communication to take place. These means
range from bulletin boards to meeting facilities to the United States mail.
During election periods, PLEA is assured of equal access to all modes of
communication. There is no showing here that PLEA's ability to communicate
with teachers is seriously impinged by the restricted access to the internal mail
system. The variety and type of alternative modes of access present here
compare favorably with those in other nonpublic forum cases where we have
upheld restrictions on access.
IV
The Court of Appeals also held that the differential access provided the rival
unions constituted impermissible content discrimination in violation of the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We have rejected this
contention when cast as a First Amendment argument, and it fares no better in
equal protection garb. ***
V
The Court of Appeals invalidated the limited privileges PEA negotiated as the
bargaining voice of the Perry Township teachers by misapplying our cases that
have dealt with the rights of free expression on streets, parks, and other fora
generally open for assembly and debate. Virtually every other court to consider
this type of exclusive-access policy has upheld it as constitutional, and today,
so do we. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Robson

472

The First Amendment

Reversed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE POWELL, AND JUSTICE
STEVENS JOIN, DISSENTING.
The Court today holds that an incumbent teachers' union may negotiate a
collective-bargaining agreement with a school board that grants the incumbent
access to teachers' mailboxes and to the interschool mail system and denies
such access to a rival union. Because the exclusive-access provision in the
collective-bargaining agreement amounts to viewpoint discrimination that
infringes the respondents' First Amendment rights and fails to advance any
substantial state interest, I dissent.
The Court properly acknowledges that teachers have protected First
Amendment rights within the school context. See Tinker v. Des Moines School
District (1969). In particular, we have held that teachers may not be "compelled
to relinquish the First Amendment rights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens
to comment on matters of public interest in connection with the operation of
the public schools in which they work." Pickering v. Board of Education (1968).
***
From this point of departure the Court veers sharply off course. Based on a
finding that the interschool mail system is not a "public forum," the Court
states that the respondents have no right of access to the system, ibid., and
that the School Board is free "to make distinctions in access on the basis of
subject matter and speaker identity if the distinctions are "reasonable in light of
the purpose which the forum at issue serves." According to the Court, the
petitioner's status as the exclusive bargaining representative provides a
reasonable basis for the exclusive-access policy.
The Court fundamentally misperceives the essence of the respondents' claims
and misunderstands the thrust of the Court of Appeals' well-reasoned opinion.
This case does not involve an "absolute access" claim. It involves an "equal
access" claim. As such it does not turn on whether the internal school mail
system is a "public forum." In focusing on the public forum issue, the Court
disregards the First Amendment's central proscription against censorship, in
the form of viewpoint discrimination, in any forum, public or nonpublic.
*** Once the government permits discussion of certain subject matter, it may
not impose restrictions that discriminate among viewpoints on those subjects
whether a nonpublic forum is involved or not. *** We have never held that
government may allow discussion of a subject and then discriminate among
viewpoints on that particular topic, even if the government for certain reasons
may entirely exclude discussion of the subject from the forum. In this context,
the greater power does not include the lesser because for First Amendment
purposes exercise of the lesser power is more threatening to core values.
Viewpoint discrimination is censorship in its purest form and government
regulation that discriminates among viewpoints threatens the continued vitality
of "free speech."
Against this background, it is clear that the Court's approach to this case is
flawed. By focusing on whether the interschool mail system is a public forum,

Robson

473

The First Amendment

the Court disregards the independent First Amendment protection afforded by
the prohibition against viewpoint discrimination. This case does not involve a
claim of an absolute right of access to the forum to discuss any subject
whatever. If it did, public forum analysis might be relevant. This case involves a
claim of equal access to discuss a subject that the Board has approved for
discussion in the forum. In essence, the respondents are not asserting a right of
access at all; they are asserting a right to be free from discrimination. The
critical inquiry, therefore, is whether the Board's grant of exclusive access to
the petitioner amounts to prohibited viewpoint discrimination.
*** Addressing the question of viewpoint discrimination directly, free of the
Court's irrelevant public forum analysis, it is clear that the exclusive-access
policy discriminates on the basis of viewpoint. The Court of Appeals found that
"[t]he access policy adopted by the Perry schools, in form a speaker restriction,
favors a particular viewpoint on labor relations in the Perry schools . . .: the
teachers inevitably will receive from [the petitioner] self-laudatory descriptions
of its activities on their behalf and will be denied the critical perspective offered
by [the respondents]." This assessment of the effect of the policy is eminently
reasonable. Moreover, certain other factors strongly suggest that the policy
discriminates among viewpoints. ***
*** In this case the Board has infringed the respondents' First Amendment
rights by granting exclusive access to an effective channel of communication to
the petitioner and denying such access to the respondents. In view of the
petitioner's failure to establish even a substantial state interest that is
advanced by the exclusive-access policy, the policy must be held to be
constitutionally infirm. The decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.

Notes	  
1.
The Court in Perry identifies three types of public fora. Along with
an additional category that might be called a non-forum (“not a forum”),
these are the fora in current First Amendment doctrine.
A forum analysis involves two separate steps:
set of facts.

First, define the forum and then apply that definition to any

Second, articulate the standard for that forum and apply
that standard to the facts.
2.
The relationship of forum doctrine to other First Amendment
doctrines is complex and often highly contested in individual cases. The
briefly excerpted but extensive dissenting opinion in Perry joined by four
dissenting Justices essentially argues that a forum analysis should be
irrelevant.
3.
Reconsidering Conrad after Perry, is there an argument that the
theater was not a (full) public forum?

JUSTICE GINSBURG DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
In a series of decisions, this Court has emphasized that the First Amendment
generally precludes public universities from denying student organizations
access to school-sponsored forums because of the groups' viewpoints. This case
concerns a novel question regarding student activities at public universities:
May a public law school condition its official recognition of a student group-and the attendant use of school funds and facilities--on the organization's
agreement to open eligibility for membership and leadership to all students?
In the view of petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS), an accept-all-comers
policy impairs its First Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association,
and free exercise of religion by prompting it, on pain of relinquishing the
advantages of recognition, to accept members who do not share the
organization's core beliefs about religion and sexual orientation. From the
perspective of respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings or the Law
School), CLS seeks special dispensation from an across-the-board open-access
requirement designed to further the reasonable educational purposes
underpinning the school's student-organization program.
In accord with the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we reject CLS's First
Amendment challenge. Compliance with Hastings' all-comers policy, we
conclude, is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the studentorganization forum. In requiring CLS--in common with all other student
organizations--to choose between welcoming all students and forgoing the
benefits of official recognition, we hold, Hastings did not transgress
constitutional limitations. CLS, it bears emphasis, seeks not parity with other
organizations, but a preferential exemption from Hastings' policy. The First
Amendment shields CLS against state prohibition of the organization's
expressive activity, however exclusionary that activity may be. But CLS enjoys
no constitutional right to state subvention of its selectivity.
I
Founded in 1878, Hastings was the first law school in the University of
California public-school system. Like many institutions of higher education,
Hastings encourages students to form extracurricular associations that
"contribute to the Hastings community and experience." These groups offer
students "opportunities to pursue academic and social interests outside of the

Robson

475

The First Amendment

classroom [to] further their education" and to help them "develo[p] leadership
skills."
Through its "Registered Student Organization" (RSO) program, Hastings extends
official recognition to student groups. Several benefits attend this schoolapproved status. RSOs are eligible to seek financial assistance from the Law
School, which subsidizes their events using funds from a mandatory studentactivity fee imposed on all students. RSOs may also use Law-School channels to
communicate with students: They may place announcements in a weekly
Office-of-Student-Services newsletter, advertise events on designated bulletin
boards, send e-mails using a Hastings-organization address, and participate in
an annual Student Organizations Fair designed to advance recruitment efforts.
In addition, RSOs may apply for permission to use the Law School's facilities for
meetings and office space. Finally, Hastings allows officially recognized groups
to use its name and logo.
In exchange for these benefits, RSOs must abide by certain conditions. Only a
"non-commercial organization whose membership is limited to Hastings
students may become [an RSO]." A prospective RSO must submit its bylaws to
Hastings for approval, and if it intends to use the Law School's name or logo, it
must sign a license agreement. Critical here, all RSOs must undertake to
comply with Hastings' "Policies and Regulations Applying to College Activities,
Organizations and Students."
The Law School's Policy on Nondiscrimination (Nondiscrimination Policy), which
binds RSOs, states:
"[Hastings] is committed to a policy against legally impermissible, arbitrary or
unreasonable discriminatory practices. All groups, including administration,
faculty, student governments, [Hastings]-owned student residence facilities and
programs sponsored by [Hastings], are governed by this policy of
nondiscrimination. [Hasting's] policy on nondiscrimination is to comply fully
with applicable law.
"[Hastings] shall not discriminate unlawfully on the basis of race, color, religion,
national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex or sexual orientation. This
nondiscrimination policy covers admission, access and treatment in Hastingssponsored programs and activities."

Hastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as it relates to the RSO
program, to mandate acceptance of all comers: School-approved groups must
"allow any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership
positions in the organization, regardless of [her] status or beliefs." Other law
schools have adopted similar all-comers policies. See, e.g., Georgetown
University Law Center, Office of Student Life: Student Organizations, available
at http://www.law.georgetown.edu/ StudentLife/StudentOrgs/NewGroup.htm

ndbook.pdf ("[Student] organizations are open to all students."). From Hastings'
adoption of its Nondiscrimination Policy in 1990 until the events stirring this
litigation, "no student organization at Hastings ... ever sought an exemption
from the Policy."

Robson

476

The First Amendment

In 2004, CLS became the first student group to do so. At the beginning of the
academic year, the leaders of a predecessor Christian organization--which had
been an RSO at Hastings for a decade--formed CLS by affiliating with the
national Christian Legal Society (CLS-National). CLS-National, an association of
Christian lawyers and law students, charters student chapters at law schools
throughout the country. CLS chapters must adopt bylaws that, inter alia,
require members and officers to sign a "Statement of Faith" and to conduct
their lives in accord with prescribed principles. Among those tenets is the belief
that sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man and a
woman; CLS thus interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation anyone who
engages in "unrepentant homosexual conduct." CLS also excludes students who
hold religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.
On September 17, 2004, CLS submitted to Hastings an application for RSO
status, accompanied by all required documents, including the set of bylaws
mandated by CLS-National. Several days later, the Law School rejected the
application; CLS's bylaws, Hastings explained, did not comply with the
Nondiscrimination Policy because CLS barred students based on religion and
sexual orientation.
CLS formally requested an exemption from the Nondiscrimination Policy, but
Hastings declined to grant one. "[T]o be one of our student-recognized
organizations," Hastings reiterated, "CLS must open its membership to all
students irrespective of their religious beliefs or sexual orientation." If CLS
instead chose to operate outside the RSO program, Hastings stated, the school
"would be pleased to provide [CLS] the use of Hastings facilities for its meetings
and activities." CLS would also have access to chalkboards and generally
available campus bulletin boards to announce its events. In other words,
Hastings would do nothing to suppress CLS's endeavors, but neither would it
lend RSO-level support for them.
Refusing to alter its bylaws, CLS did not obtain RSO status. It did, however,
operate independently during the 2004-2005 academic year. CLS held weekly
Bible-study meetings and invited Hastings students to Good Friday and Easter
Sunday church services. It also hosted a beach barbeque, Thanksgiving dinner,
campus lecture on the Christian faith and the legal practice, several fellowship
dinners, an end-of-year banquet, and other informal social activities.
On October 22, 2004, CLS filed suit against various Hastings officers and
administrators under 42 U. S. C. §1983. Its complaint alleged that Hastings'
refusal to grant the organization RSO status violated CLS's First and
Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free
exercise of religion. The suit sought injunctive and declaratory relief.
On cross-motions for summary judgment, the U. S. District Court for the
Northern District of California ruled in favor of Hastings. The Law School's allcomers condition on access to a limited public forum, the court held, was both
reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and therefore did not violate CLS's right to
free speech.
Nor, in the District Court's view, did the Law School impermissibly impair CLS's
right to expressive association. "Hastings is not directly ordering CLS to admit
[any] studen[t]," the court observed; "[r]ather, Hastings has merely placed

Robson

477

The First Amendment

conditions on" the use of its facilities and funds, ibid. "Hastings' denial of
official recognition," the court added, "was not a substantial impediment to
CLS's ability to meet and communicate as a group."
The court also rejected CLS's Free Exercise Clause argument. "[T]he
Nondiscrimination Policy does not target or single out religious beliefs," the
court noted; rather, the policy "is neutral and of general applicability." "CLS
may be motivated by its religious beliefs to exclude students based on their
religion or sexual orientation," the court explained, "but that does not convert
the reason for Hastings' [Nondiscrimination Policy] to be one that is religiouslybased."
On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed [in a brief opinion]. We granted certiorari
and now affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment.
II
Before considering the merits of CLS's constitutional arguments, we must
resolve a preliminary issue: CLS urges us to review the Nondiscrimination
Policy as written--prohibiting discrimination on several enumerated bases,
including religion and sexual orientation--and not as a requirement that all
RSOs accept all comers. The written terms of the Nondiscrimination Policy, CLS
contends, "targe[t] solely those groups whose beliefs are based on religion or
that disapprove of a particular kind of sexual behavior," and leave other
associations free to limit membership and leadership to individuals committed
to the group's ideology. For example, "[a] political ... group can insist that its
leaders support its purposes and beliefs," CLS alleges, but "a religious group
cannot."
CLS's assertion runs headlong into the stipulation of facts it jointly submitted
with Hastings at the summary-judgment stage. In that filing, the parties
specified:
"Hastings requires that registered student organizations allow any
student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions in
the organization, regardless of [her] status or beliefs. Thus, for example,
the Hastings Democratic Caucus cannot bar students holding
Republican political beliefs from becoming members or seeking
leadership positions in the organization."
App. 221 (Joint Stipulation ¶18) (emphasis added; citations omitted).
Under the District Court's local rules, stipulated facts are deemed "undisputed."
Civil Local Rule 56-2 (ND Cal. 2010). See also Pet. for Cert. 2 ("The material
facts of this case are undisputed.").
Litigants, we have long recognized, "[a]re entitled to have [their] case tried upon
the assumption that ... facts, stipulated into the record, were established." This
entitlement is the bookend to a party's undertaking to be bound by the factual
stipulations it submits. ***
Time and again, the dissent races away from the facts to which CLS stipulated.
But factual stipulations are "formal concessions ... that have the effect of
withdrawing a fact from issue and dispensing wholly with the need for proof of
the fact. Thus, a judicial admission ... is conclusive in the case."

Robson

478

The First Amendment

In light of the joint stipulation, both the District Court and the Ninth Circuit
trained their attention on the constitutionality of the all-comers requirement, as
described in the parties' accord. See 319 Fed. Appx., at 645-646; App. to Pet.
for Cert. 32a; id., at 36a. We reject CLS's unseemly attempt to escape from the
stipulation and shift its target to Hastings' policy as written. This opinion,
therefore, considers only whether conditioning access to a student-organization
forum on compliance with an all-comers policy violates the Constitution.
III
A
In support of the argument that Hastings' all-comers policy treads on its First
Amendment rights to free speech and expressive association, CLS draws on two
lines of decisions. First, in a progression of cases, this Court has employed
forum analysis to determine when a governmental entity, in regulating property
in its charge, may place limitations on speech. Recognizing a State's right "to
preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully
dedicated," Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc. (1985) the Court
has permitted restrictions on access to a limited public forum, like the RSO
program here, with this key caveat: Any access barrier must be reasonable and
viewpoint neutral.
Second, as evidenced by another set of decisions, this Court has rigorously
reviewed laws and regulations that constrain associational freedom. In the
context of public accommodations, we have subjected restrictions on that
freedom to close scrutiny; such restrictions are permitted only if they serve
"compelling state interests" that are "unrelated to the suppression of ideas"-interests that cannot be advanced "through ... significantly less restrictive
[means]." Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984). See also, e.g., Boy Scouts of
America v. Dale (2000). "Freedom of association," we have recognized, "plainly
presupposes a freedom not to associate." Roberts. Insisting that an organization
embrace unwelcome members, we have therefore concluded, "directly and
immediately affects associational rights." Dale.
CLS would have us engage each line of cases independently, but its expressiveassociation and free-speech arguments merge: Who speaks on its behalf, CLS
reasons, colors what concept is conveyed. It therefore makes little sense to
treat CLS's speech and association claims as discrete. Instead, three
observations lead us to conclude that our limited-public-forum precedents
supply the appropriate framework for assessing both CLS's speech and
association rights.
First, the same considerations that have led us to apply a less restrictive level of
scrutiny to speech in limited public forums as compared to other environments,
apply with equal force to expressive association occurring in limited public
forums. As just noted, speech and expressive-association rights are closely
linked. Roberts (Associational freedom is "implicit in the right to engage in
activities protected by the First Amendment."). When these intertwined rights
arise in exactly the same context, it would be anomalous for a restriction on
speech to survive constitutional review under our limited-public-forum test only
to be invalidated as an impermissible infringement of expressive association.

Robson

479

The First Amendment

That result would be all the more anomalous in this case, for CLS suggests that
its expressive-association claim plays a part auxiliary to speech's starring role.
Second, and closely related, the strict scrutiny we have applied in some settings
to laws that burden expressive association would, in practical effect, invalidate
a defining characteristic of limited public forums--the State may "reserv[e]
[them] for certain groups." See also Perry Ed. Assn., ("Implicit in the concept" of
a limited public forum is the State's "right to make distinctions in access on the
basis of ... speaker identity.").
An example sharpens the tip of this point: Schools, including Hastings,
ordinarily, and without controversy, limit official student-group recognition to
organizations comprising only students--even if those groups wish to associate
with nonstudents. The same ground rules must govern both speech and
association challenges in the limited-public-forum context, lest strict scrutiny
trump a public university's ability to "confin[e] a [speech] forum to the limited
and legitimate purposes for which it was created."
Third, this case fits comfortably within the limited-public-forum category, for
CLS, in seeking what is effectively a state subsidy, faces only indirect pressure
to modify its membership policies; CLS may exclude any person for any reason
if it forgoes the benefits of official recognition. The expressive-association
precedents on which CLS relies, in contrast, involved regulations that
compelled a group to include unwanted members, with no choice to opt out.
See, e.g., Dale (regulation "forc[ed] [the Boy Scouts] to accept members it [did]
not desire" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Roberts ("There can be no
clearer example of an intrusion into the internal structure or affairs of an
association than" forced inclusion of unwelcome participants.).
In diverse contexts, our decisions have distinguished between policies that
require action and those that withhold benefits. Application of the lessrestrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact that
Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not
wielding the stick of prohibition.
In sum, we are persuaded that our limited-public-forum precedents adequately
respect both CLS's speech and expressive-association rights, and fairly balance
those rights against Hastings' interests as property owner and educational
institution. We turn to the merits of the instant dispute, therefore, with the
limited-public-forum decisions as our guide.
B
As earlier pointed out, we do not write on a blank slate; we have three times
before considered clashes between public universities and student groups
seeking official recognition or its attendant benefits. First, in Healy v. James
(1972), a state college denied school affiliation to a student group that wished to
form a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Characterizing
SDS's mission as violent and disruptive, and finding the organization's
philosophy repugnant, the college completely banned the SDS chapter from
campus; in its effort to sever all channels of communication between students
and the group, university officials went so far as to disband a meeting of SDS
members in a campus coffee shop. The college, we noted, could require "that a

Robson

480

The First Amendment

group seeking official recognition affirm in advance its willingness to adhere to
reasonable campus law," including "reasonable standards respecting conduct."
But a public educational institution exceeds constitutional bounds, we held,
when it "restrict[s] speech or association simply because it finds the views
expressed by [a] group to be abhorrent."
We later relied on Healy in Widmar v. Vincent (1981). In that case, a public
university, in an effort to avoid state support for religion, had closed its facilities
to a registered student group that sought to use university space for religious
worship and discussion. "A university's mission is education," we observed,
"and decisions of this Court have never denied a university's authority to
impose reasonable regulations compatible with that mission upon the use of its
campus and facilities." But because the university singled out religious
organizations for disadvantageous treatment, we subjected the university's
regulation to strict scrutiny. The school's interest "in maintaining strict
separation of church and State," we held, was not "sufficiently compelling to
justify ... [viewpoint] discrimination against ... religious speech."
Most recently and comprehensively, in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ.
of Virginia (1995), we reiterated that a university generally may not withhold
benefits from student groups because of their religious outlook. The officially
recognized student group in Rosenberger was denied student-activity-fee
funding to distribute a newspaper because the publication discussed issues
from a Christian perspective. By "select[ing] for disfavored treatment those
student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints," we held, the
university had engaged in "viewpoint discrimination, which is presumed
impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's
limitations."
In all three cases, we ruled that student groups had been unconstitutionally
singled out because of their points of view. "Once it has opened a limited
[public] forum," we emphasized, "the State must respect the lawful boundaries
it has itself set." The constitutional constraints on the boundaries the State may
set bear repetition here: "The State may not exclude speech where its
distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum, ... nor
may it discriminate against speech on the basis of ... viewpoint."
C
We first consider whether Hastings' policy is reasonable taking into account the
RSO forum's function and "all the surrounding circumstances."
1
Our inquiry is shaped by the educational context in which it arises: "First
Amendment rights," we have observed, "must be analyzed in light of the special
characteristics of the school environment." Widmar. This Court is the final
arbiter of the question whether a public university has exceeded constitutional
constraints, and we owe no deference to universities when we consider that
question.
Cognizant that judges lack the on-the-ground expertise and
experience of school administrators, however, we have cautioned courts in

Robson

481

The First Amendment

various contexts to resist "substitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational
policy for those of the school authorities which they review."
A college's commission--and its concomitant license to choose among
pedagogical approaches--is not confined to the classroom, for extracurricular
programs are, today, essential parts of the educational process. Schools, we
have emphasized, enjoy "a significant measure of authority over the type of
officially recognized activities in which their students participate." We therefore
"approach our task with special caution," mindful that Hastings' decisions
about the character of its student-group program are due decent respect.
2
With appropriate regard for school administrators' judgment, we review the
justifications Hastings offers in defense of its all-comers requirement. First, the
open-access policy "ensures that the leadership, educational, and social
opportunities afforded by [RSOs] are available to all students." Just as
"Hastings does not allow its professors to host classes open only to those
students with a certain status or belief," so the Law School may decide,
reasonably in our view, "that the ... educational experience is best promoted
when all participants in the forum must provide equal access to all students."
RSOs, we count it significant, are eligible for financial assistance drawn from
mandatory student-activity fees; the all-comers policy ensures that no Hastings
student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.
Second, the all-comers requirement helps Hastings police the written terms of
its Nondiscrimination Policy without inquiring into an RSO's motivation for
membership restrictions. To bring the RSO program within CLS's view of the
Constitution's limits, CLS proposes that Hastings permit exclusion because of
belief but forbid discrimination due to status. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. But that
proposal would impose on Hastings a daunting labor. How should the Law
School go about determining whether a student organization cloaked prohibited
status exclusion in belief-based garb? If a hypothetical Male-Superiority Club
barred a female student from running for its presidency, for example, how could
the Law School tell whether the group rejected her bid because of her sex or
because, by seeking to lead the club, she manifested a lack of belief in its
fundamental philosophy?
This case itself is instructive in this regard. CLS contends that it does not
exclude individuals because of sexual orientation, but rather "on the basis of a
conjunction of conduct and the belief that the conduct is not wrong." Our
decisions have declined to distinguish between status and conduct in this
context. See Lawrence v. Texas (2003).
Third, the Law School reasonably adheres to the view that an all-comers policy,
to the extent it brings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and beliefs,
"encourages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among students." And if the
policy sometimes produces discord, Hastings can rationally rank among RSOprogram goals development of conflict-resolution skills, toleration, and
readiness to find common ground.
Fourth, Hastings' policy, which incorporates--in fact, subsumes--state-law
proscriptions on discrimination, conveys the Law School's decision "to decline

Robson

482

The First Amendment

to subsidize with public monies and benefits conduct of which the people of
California disapprove." State law, of course, may not command that public
universities take action impermissible under the First Amendment. But so long
as a public university does not contravene constitutional limits, its choice to
advance state-law goals through the school's educational endeavors stands on
firm footing.
In sum, the several justifications Hastings asserts in support of its all-comers
requirement are surely reasonable in light of the RSO forum's purposes.
3
The Law School's policy is all the more creditworthy in view of the "substantial
alternative channels that remain open for [CLS-student] communication to take
place." Perry Ed. Assn. If restrictions on access to a limited public forum are
viewpoint discriminatory, the ability of a group to exist outside the forum would
not cure the constitutional shortcoming. But when access barriers are
viewpoint neutral, our decisions have counted it significant that other available
avenues for the group to exercise its First Amendment rights lessen the burden
created by those barriers.
In this case, Hastings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct
meetings and the use of chalkboards and generally available bulletin boards to
advertise events. Although CLS could not take advantage of RSO-specific
methods of communication, the advent of electronic media and socialnetworking sites reduces the importance of those channels. See App. 114-115
(CLS maintained a Yahoo! message group to disseminate information to
students.); Christian Legal Society v. Walker, 453 F. 3d 853, 874 (CA7 2006)
(Wood, J., dissenting) ("Most universities and colleges, and most college-aged
students, communicate through email, websites, and hosts like MySpace ... . If
CLS had its own website, any student at the school with access to Google--that
is, all of them--could easily have found it."). See also Brief for Associated
Students of the University of California, Hastings College of Law as Amicus
Curiae 14-18 (describing host of ways CLS could communicate with Hastings'
students outside official channels).
Private groups, from fraternities and sororities to social clubs and secret
societies, commonly maintain a presence at universities without official school
affiliation. Based on the record before us, CLS was similarly situated: It hosted
a variety of activities the year after Hastings denied it recognition, and the
number of students attending those meetings and events doubled. "The variety
and type of alternative modes of access present here," in short, "compare
favorably with those in other [limited public] forum cases where we have upheld
restrictions on access." Perry Ed. Assn. It is beyond dissenter's license, we note
again, constantly to maintain that nonrecognition of a student organization is
equivalent to prohibiting its members from speaking.
4
CLS nevertheless deems Hastings' all-comers policy "frankly absurd." "There
can be no diversity of viewpoints in a forum," it asserts, "if groups are not
permitted to form around viewpoints."
This catchphrase confuses CLS's
preferred policy with constitutional limitation--the advisability of Hastings'

Robson

483

The First Amendment

policy does not control its permissibility. Instead, we have repeatedly stressed
that a State's restriction on access to a limited public forum "need not be the
most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation."
CLS also assails the reasonableness of the all-comers policy in light of the RSO
forum's function by forecasting that the policy will facilitate hostile takeovers; if
organizations must open their arms to all, CLS contends, saboteurs will
infiltrate groups to subvert their mission and message. This supposition strikes
us as more hypothetical than real. CLS points to no history or prospect of RSOhijackings at Hastings. Students tend to self-sort and presumably will not
endeavor en masse to join--let alone seek leadership positions in--groups
pursuing missions wholly at odds with their personal beliefs. And if a rogue
student intent on sabotaging an organization's objectives nevertheless
attempted a takeover, the members of that group would not likely elect her as
an officer.
RSOs, moreover, in harmony with the all-comers policy, may condition
eligibility for membership and leadership on attendance, the payment of dues,
or other neutral requirements designed to ensure that students join because of
their commitment to a group's vitality, not its demise. Several RSOs at Hastings
limit their membership rolls and officer slates in just this way. See, e.g., App.
192 (members must "[p]ay their dues on a timely basis" and "attend meetings
regularly"); id., at 173 (members must complete an application and pay dues;
"[a]ny active member who misses a semester of regularly scheduled meetings
shall be dropped from rolls"); App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a ("Only Hastings
students who have held membership in this organization for a minimum of one
semester shall be eligible to be an officer.").
Hastings, furthermore, could reasonably expect more from its law students
than the disruptive behavior CLS hypothesizes--and to build this expectation
into its educational approach. A reasonable policy need not anticipate and
preemptively close off every opportunity for avoidance or manipulation. If
students begin to exploit an all-comers policy by hijacking organizations to
distort or destroy their missions, Hastings presumably would revisit and revise
its policy.
Finally, CLS asserts (and the dissent repeats) that the Law School lacks any
legitimate interest--let alone one reasonably related to the RSO forum's
purposes--in urging "religious groups not to favor co-religionists for purposes of
their religious activities." CLS's analytical error lies in focusing on the benefits it
must forgo while ignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out: Exclusion,
after all, has two sides. Hastings, caught in the crossfire between a group's
desire to exclude and students' demand for equal access, may reasonably draw
a line in the sand permitting all organizations to express what they wish but no
group to discriminate in membership.
D
We next consider whether Hastings' all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral.
1

Robson

484

The First Amendment

Although this aspect of limited-public-forum analysis has been the
constitutional sticking point in our prior decisions, as earlier recounted, we
need not dwell on it here. It is, after all, hard to imagine a more viewpointneutral policy than one requiring all student groups to accept all comers. In
contrast to Healy, Widmar, and Rosenberger, in which universities singled out
organizations for disfavored treatment because of their points of view, Hastings'
all-comers requirement draws no distinction between groups based on their
message or perspective. An all-comers condition on access to RSO status, in
short, is textbook viewpoint neutral.
2
Conceding that Hastings' all-comers policy is "nominally neutral," CLS attacks
the regulation by pointing to its effect: The policy is vulnerable to constitutional
assault, CLS contends, because "it systematically and predictably burdens most
heavily those groups whose viewpoints are out of favor with the campus
mainstream."
This argument stumbles from its first step because "[a]
regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is
deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or
messages but not others." Ward v. Rock Against Racism (1989).
Even if a regulation has a differential impact on groups wishing to enforce
exclusionary membership policies, "[w]here the [State] does not target conduct
on the basis of its expressive content, acts are not shielded from regulation
merely because they express a discriminatory idea or philosophy." R. A. V. v. St.
Paul (1992).
Hastings' requirement that student groups accept all comers, we are satisfied,
"is justified without reference to the content [or viewpoint] of the regulated
speech." The Law School's policy aims at the act of rejecting would-be group
members without reference to the reasons motivating that behavior: Hastings'
"desire to redress th[e] perceived harms" of exclusionary membership policies
"provides an adequate explanation for its [all-comers condition] over and above
mere disagreement with [any student group's] beliefs or biases." Wisconsin v.
Mitchell (1993). CLS's conduct--not its Christian perspective--is, from Hastings'
vantage point, what stands between the group and RSO status. "In the end," as
Hastings observes, "CLS is simply confusing its own viewpoint-based objections
to ... nondiscrimination laws (which it is entitled to have and [to] voice) with
viewpoint discrimination." Brief for Hastings 31.
Finding Hastings' open-access condition on RSO status reasonable and
viewpoint neutral, we reject CLS' free-speech and expressive-association claims.
IV
In its reply brief, CLS contends that "[t]he peculiarity, incoherence, and suspect
history of the all-comers policy all point to pretext." Neither the District Court
nor the Ninth Circuit addressed an argument that Hastings selectively enforces
its all-comers policy, and this Court is not the proper forum to air the issue in
the first instance. On remand, the Ninth Circuit may consider CLS's pretext
argument if, and to the extent, it is preserved.

Robson

485

The First Amendment

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Court of Appeals' ruling that the allcomers policy is constitutional and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS, CONCURRING.
The Court correctly confines its discussion to the narrow issue presented by the
record, and correctly upholds the all-comers policy. I join its opinion without
reservation. Because the dissent has volunteered an argument that the school's
general Nondiscrimination Policy would be "plainly" unconstitutional if applied
to this case (opinion of Alito, J.), a brief response is appropriate. In my view,
both policies are plainly legitimate. ***
It is critical, in evaluating CLS's challenge to the Nondiscrimination Policy, to
keep in mind that an RSO program is a limited forum--the boundaries of which
may be delimited by the proprietor. When a religious association, or a secular
association, operates in a wholly public setting, it must be allowed broad
freedom to control its membership and its message, even if its decisions cause
offense to outsiders. Profound constitutional problems would arise if the State
of California tried to "demand that all Christian groups admit members who
believe that Jesus was merely human." (Alito, J., dissenting). But the CLS
chapter that brought this lawsuit does not want to be just a Christian group; it
aspires to be a recognized student organization. The Hastings College of Law is
not a legislature. And no state actor has demanded that anyone do anything
outside the confines of a discrete, voluntary academic program. Although it may
be the case that to some "university students, the campus is their world," it
does not follow that the campus ought to be equated with the public square.
The campus is, in fact, a world apart from the public square in numerous
respects, and religious organizations, as well as all other organizations, must
abide by certain norms of conduct when they enter an academic community.
Public universities serve a distinctive role in a modern democratic society. Like
all specialized government entities, they must make countless decisions about
how to allocate resources in pursuit of their role. Some of those decisions will
be controversial; many will have differential effects across populations; virtually
all will entail value judgments of some kind. As a general matter, courts should
respect universities' judgments and let them manage their own affairs.
The RSO forum is no different. It is not an open commons that Hastings
happens to maintain. It is a mechanism through which Hastings confers certain
benefits and pursues certain aspects of its educational mission. Having
exercised its discretion to establish an RSO program, a university must treat all
participants evenhandedly. But the university need not remain neutral--indeed
it could not remain neutral--in determining which goals the program will serve
and which rules are best suited to facilitate those goals. These are not legal
questions but policy questions; they are not for the Court but for the university
to make. When any given group refuses to comply with the rules, the RSO
sponsor need not admit that group at the cost of undermining the program and
the values reflected therein. On many levels, a university administrator has a

Robson

486

The First Amendment

"greater interest in the content of student activities than the police chief has in
the content of a soapbox oration." Widmar v. Vincent (1981) (Stevens, J.,
concurring in judgment).
***
JUSTICE KENNEDY, CONCURRING.
To be effective, a limited forum often will exclude some speakers based on their
affiliation (e.g., student versus nonstudent) or based on the content of their
speech, interests, and expertise (e.g., art professor not chosen as speaker for
conference on public transit). When the government does exclude from a limited
forum, however, other content-based judgments may be impermissible. For
instance, an otherwise qualified and relevant speaker may not be excluded
because of hostility to his or her views or beliefs. ***
In the instant case, however, if the membership qualification were enforced, it
would contradict a legitimate purpose for having created the limited forum in
the first place. Many educational institutions, including respondent Hastings
College of Law, have recognized that the process of learning occurs both
formally in a classroom setting and informally outside of it. Students may be
shaped as profoundly by their peers as by their teachers. Extracurricular
activities, such as those in the Hastings "Registered Student Organization"
program, facilitate interactions between students, enabling them to explore new
points of view, to develop interests and talents, and to nurture a growing sense
of self. The Hasting program is designed to allow all students to interact with
their colleagues across a broad, seemingly unlimited range of ideas, views, and
activities. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.) ("[A]
great deal of learning ... occurs through interactions among students ... who
have a wide variety of interests, talents, and perspectives; and who are able,
directly or indirectly, to learn from their differences and to stimulate one
another to reexamine even their most deeply held assumptions about
themselves and their world" (alteration in original; internal quotation marks
omitted)).
Law students come from many backgrounds and have but three years to meet
each other and develop their skills. They do so by participating in a community
that teaches them how to create arguments in a convincing, rational, and
respectful manner and to express doubt and disagreement in a professional way.
A law school furthers these objectives by allowing broad diversity in registered
student organizations. But these objectives may be better achieved if students
can act cooperatively to learn from and teach each other through interactions in
social and intellectual contexts. A vibrant dialogue is not possible if students
wall themselves off from opposing points of view.
The school's objectives thus might not be well served if, as a condition to
membership or participation in a group, students were required to avow
particular personal beliefs or to disclose private, off-campus behavior. Students
whose views are in the minority at the school would likely fare worse in that
regime. Indeed, were those sorts of requirements to become prevalent, it might
undermine the principle that in a university community--and in a law school
community specifically--speech is deemed persuasive based on its substance,
not the identity of the speaker. The era of loyalty oaths is behind us. A school

Robson

487

The First Amendment

quite properly may conclude that allowing an oath or belief-affirming
requirement, or an outside conduct requirement, could be divisive for student
relations and inconsistent with the basic concept that a view's validity should
be tested through free and open discussion. The school's policy therefore
represents a permissible effort to preserve the value of its forum. ***
JUSTICE ALITO, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, AND JUSTICE
THOMAS JOIN, DISSENTING.
The proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the
freedom to express "the thought that we hate." United States v. Schwimmer,
(1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting). Today's decision rests on a very different
principle: no freedom for expression that offends prevailing standards of
political correctness in our country's institutions of higher learning.
*** While I think that Healy [v. James (1972)] is largely controlling, I am content
to address the constitutionality of Hastings' actions under our limited public
forum cases, which lead to exactly the same conclusion.
In this case, the forum consists of the RSO program. Once a public university
opens a limited public forum, it "must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself
set." Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995). The university
"may not exclude speech where its distinction is not 'reasonable in light of the
purpose served by the forum.' " And the university must maintain strict
viewpoint neutrality. Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth
(2000); Rosenberger.
This requirement of viewpoint neutrality extends to the expression of religious
viewpoints. ***
We have applied this analysis in cases in which student speech was restricted
because of the speaker's religious viewpoint, and we have consistently
concluded that such restrictions constitute viewpoint discrimination.
*** The accept-all-comers policy is antithetical to the design of the RSO forum
for the same reason that a state-imposed accept-all-comers policy would violate
the First Amendment rights of private groups if applied off campus. As
explained above, a group's First Amendment right of expressive association is
burdened by the "forced inclusion" of members whose presence would "affec[t]
in a significant way the group's ability to advocate public or private viewpoints."
Dale. The Court has therefore held that the government may not compel a
group that engages in "expressive association" to admit such a member unless
the government has a compelling interest, " 'unrelated to the suppression of
ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of
associational freedoms.' "
There can be no dispute that this standard would not permit a generally
applicable law mandating that private religious groups admit members who do
not share the groups' beliefs. Religious groups like CLS obviously engage in
expressive association, and no legitimate state interest could override the
powerful effect that an accept-all-comers law would have on the ability of
religious groups to express their views. The State of California surely could not
demand that all Christian groups admit members who believe that Jesus was

488

The First Amendment

merely human. Jewish groups could not be required to admit anti-Semites and
Holocaust deniers. Muslim groups could not be forced to admit persons who are
viewed as slandering Islam.
While there can be no question that the State of California could not impose
such restrictions on all religious groups in the State, the Court now holds that
Hastings, a state institution, may impose these very same requirements on
students who wish to participate in a forum that is designed to foster the
expression of diverse viewpoints. ***
I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that today's decision is a serious
setback for freedom of expression in this country. Our First Amendment reflects
a "profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues
should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open." New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
(1964). Even if the United States is the only Nation that shares this
commitment to the same extent, I would not change our law to conform to the
international norm. I fear that the Court's decision marks a turn in that
direction. Even those who find CLS's views objectionable should be concerned
about the way the group has been treated--by Hastings, the Court of Appeals,
and now this Court. I can only hope that this decision will turn out to be an
aberration.

Notes	  
1.
Christian Legal Society (CLS) v. Martinez again illustrates that First
Amendment cases often present a dizzying array of different doctrines to
analyze and decide any particular dispute. How does the forum analysis
shape the outcome for the Court’s opinion?
2.
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Alito argues that he is “content
to address the constitutionality of Hastings' actions under our limited
public forum cases, which lead to exactly the same conclusion” and
explains that “the forum consists of the RSO program.” However, the
dissenting opinion also states
The accept-all-comers policy is antithetical to the design of the RSO forum for
the same reason that a state-imposed accept-all-comers policy would violate the
First Amendment rights of private groups if applied off campus.

Does this mean the forum analysis is irrelevant?
3.
Recall that in Board of Regents of Univ. of Wisconsin System v.
Southworth, 529 U.S. 217 (2000) [Chapter 6] the Court held invalid the
collection of a student fee awarded to RSO’s. The Court noted:
Our public forum cases are instructive here by close analogy. This is true
even though the student activities fund is not a public forum in the
traditional sense of the term and despite the circumstance that those
cases most often involve a demand for access, not a claim to be exempt
from supporting speech.

It added that the university “is free to enact viewpoint neutral rules
restricting off-campus travel or other expenditures by RSO's, for it may
create what is tantamount to a limited public forum if the principles of
viewpoint neutrality are respected.” It then distinguished this from
situations in which “the University speaks, either in its own name
through its regents or officers, or in myriad other ways through its
diverse faculties, the analysis likely would be altogether different,” citing
Rust v. Sullivan (1991).
Would it be possible for a law school (or university) to require
RSO’s to be “dedicated to social justice”?

Note:	  Trespassing	  in	  a	  Public	  Forum?	  
In Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113 (2003), Justice Scalia wrote for a
unanimous Court and upheld the constitutionality of a housing
authority’s trespass policy. As the Court explained:
The Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority (RRHA) owns and
operates a housing development for low-income residents called Whitcomb Court.
Until June 23, 1997, the city of Richmond owned the streets within Whitcomb
Court. The city council decided, however, to "privatize" these streets in an effort
to combat rampant crime and drug dealing in Whitcomb Court--much of it
committed and conducted by nonresidents. ***
The city then conveyed these streets by a recorded deed to the RRHA (which is a
political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia). This deed required the
RRHA to " 'give the appearance that the closed street, particularly at the
entrances, are no longer public streets and that they are in fact private streets.' "
To this end, the RRHA posted red-and-white signs on each apartment building-and every 100 feet along the streets--of Whitcomb Court, which state: " 'NO
TRESPASSING[.] PRIVATE PROPERTY[.] YOU ARE NOW ENTERING PRIVATE
PROPERTY AND STREETS OWNED BY RRHA. UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS WILL
BE SUBJECT TO ARREST AND PROSECUTION. UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES
WILL BE TOWED AT OWNERS EXPENSE.' The RRHA also enacted a policy
authorizing the Richmond police “'to serve notice, either orally or in writing, to
any person who is found on Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority
property when such person is not a resident, employee, or such person cannot
demonstrate a legitimate business or social purpose for being on the premises.
Such notice shall forbid the person from returning to the property. Finally,
Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority authorizes Richmond Police
Department officers to arrest any person for trespassing after such person,
having been duly notified, either stays upon or returns to Richmond
Redevelopment and Housing Authority property.' "

Respondent Kevin Hicks, a nonresident of Whitcomb Court, received a
notice from the manager excluding him from the property; he was later
convicted for trespassing at Whitcomb Court.
At trial, Hicks maintained that the RRHA's policy limiting access to Whitcomb
Court was both unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. On appeal
of his conviction, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals of Virginia initially

Robson

490

The First Amendment

rejected Hicks' contentions, but the en banc Court of Appeals reversed. That
court held that the streets of Whitcomb Court were a "traditional public forum,"
notwithstanding the city ordinance declaring them closed, and vacated Hicks'
conviction on the ground that RRHA's policy violated the First Amendment. The
Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the en banc Court of Appeals, but for different
reasons. Without deciding whether the streets of Whitcomb Court were a public
forum, the Virginia Supreme Court concluded that the RRHA policy was
unconstitutionally overbroad. While acknowledging that the policy was "designed
to punish activities that are not protected by the First Amendment," the court
held that "the policy also prohibits speech and conduct that are clearly protected
by the First Amendment." The court found the policy defective because it vested
too much discretion in Whitcomb Court's manager to determine whether an
individual's presence at Whitcomb Court is "authorized," allowing her to
"prohibit speech that she finds personally distasteful or offensive even though
such speech may be protected by the First Amendment."

The Court concluded:
Even assuming the streets of Whitcomb Court are a public forum, the noticebarment rule subjects to arrest those who reenter after trespassing and after
being warned not to return-- regardless of whether, upon their return, they seek
to engage in speech. Neither the basis for the barment sanction (the prior
trespass) nor its purpose (preventing future trespasses) has anything to do with
the First Amendment. Punishing its violation by a person who wishes to engage
in free speech no more implicates the First Amendment than would the
punishment of a person who has (pursuant to lawful regulation) been banned
from a public park after vandalizing it, and who ignores the ban in order to take
part in a political demonstration. Here, as there, it is Hicks' nonexpressive
conduct--his entry in violation of the notice-barment rule--not his speech, for
which he is punished as a trespasser.
Most importantly, both the notice-barment rule and the "legitimate business or
social purpose" rule apply to all persons who enter the streets of Whitcomb
Court, not just to those who seek to engage in expression. The rules apply to
strollers, loiterers, drug dealers, roller skaters, bird watchers, soccer players,
and others not engaged in constitutionally protected conduct--a group that
would seemingly far outnumber First Amendment speakers.

The Court further noted that
Rarely, if ever, will an overbreadth challenge succeed against a law or regulation
that is not specifically addressed to speech or to conduct necessarily associated
with speech (such as picketing or demonstrating). Applications of the RRHA
policy that violate the First Amendment can still be remedied through as-applied
litigation, but the Virginia Supreme Court should not have used the "strong
medicine" of overbreadth to invalidate the entire RRHA trespass policy.

Does the Court’s outcome undermine the language from Hague v. CIO
1939) regarding the use of streets - wherever the title may rest – as
“immemorially” held “in trust” for the use of the public? Is the Court’s
conclusion that Hicks was engaged in nonexpressive conduct
convincing?

KENNEDY, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH REHNQUIST, C.J., AND WHITE,
O'CONNOR, , AND SCALIA, JJ., JOINED. BLACKMUN, J., CONCURRED IN THE RESULT. MARSHALL,
J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH BRENNAN AND STEVENS, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
In the southeast portion of New York City's Central Park, about 10 blocks
upward from the park's beginning point at 59th Street, there is an
amphitheater and stage structure known as the Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell.
The bandshell faces west across the remaining width of the park. In close
proximity to the bandshell, and lying within the directional path of its sound, is
a grassy open area called the Sheep Meadow. The city has designated the Sheep
Meadow as a quiet area for passive recreations like reclining, walking, and
reading. Just beyond the park, and also within the potential sound range of the
bandshell, are the apartments and residences of Central Park West.
This case arises from the city's attempt to regulate the volume of amplified
music at the bandshell so the performances are satisfactory to the audience
without intruding upon those who use the Sheep Meadow or live on Central
Park West and in its vicinity.
The city's regulation requires bandshell performers to use sound-amplification
equipment and a sound technician provided by the city. The challenge to this
volume control technique comes from the sponsor of a rock concert. The trial
court sustained the noise control measures, but the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit reversed. We granted certiorari to resolve the important First
Amendment issues presented by the case.
I
Rock Against Racism, respondent in this case, is an unincorporated association
which, in its own words, is "dedicated to the espousal and promotion of
antiracist views." Each year from 1979 through 1986, RAR has sponsored a
program of speeches and rock music at the bandshell. RAR has furnished the
sound equipment and sound technician used by the various performing groups
at these annual events.
Over the years, the city received numerous complaints about excessive sound
amplification at respondent's concerts from park users and residents of areas
adjacent to the park. On some occasions RAR was less than cooperative when
city officials asked that the volume be reduced; at one concert, police felt

Robson

492

The First Amendment

compelled to cut off the power to the sound system, an action that caused the
audience to become unruly and hostile.
Before the 1984 concert, city officials met with RAR representatives to discuss
the problem of excessive noise. It was decided that the city would monitor
sound levels at the edge of the concert ground, and would revoke respondent's
event permit if specific volume limits were exceeded. Sound levels at the concert
did exceed acceptable levels for sustained periods of time, despite repeated
warnings and requests that the volume be lowered. Two citations for excessive
volume were issued to respondent during the concert. When the power was
eventually shut off, the audience became abusive and disruptive.
The following year, when respondent sought permission to hold its upcoming
concert at the bandshell, the city declined to grant an event permit, citing its
problems with noise and crowd control at RAR's previous concerts. The city
suggested some other city-owned facilities as alternative sites for the concert.
RAR declined the invitation and filed suit in United States District Court
against the city, its mayor, and various police and parks department officials,
seeking an injunction directing issuance of an event permit. After respondent
agreed to abide by all applicable regulations, the parties reached agreement and
a permit was issued.
The city then undertook to develop comprehensive New York City Parks
Department Use Guidelines for the Naumberg Bandshell. A principal problem to
be addressed by the guidelines was controlling the volume of amplified sound at
bandshell events. A major concern was that at some bandshell performances
the event sponsors had been unable to "provide the amplification levels required
and `crowds unhappy with the sound became disappointed or unruly.'" The city
found that this problem had several causes, including inadequate sound
equipment, sound technicians who were either unskilled at mixing sound
outdoors or unfamiliar with the acoustics of the bandshell and its surroundings,
and the like. Because some performers compensated for poor sound mix by
raising volume, these factors tended to exacerbate the problem of excess noise.
The city considered various solutions to the sound-amplification problem. The
idea of a fixed decibel limit for all performers using the bandshell was rejected
because the impact on listeners of a single decibel level is not constant, but
varies in response to changes in air temperature, foliage, audience size, and like
factors. The city also rejected the possibility of employing a sound technician to
operate the equipment provided by the various sponsors of bandshell events,
because the city's technician might have had difficulty satisfying the needs of
sponsors while operating unfamiliar, and perhaps inadequate, sound
equipment. Instead, the city concluded that the most effective way to achieve
adequate but not excessive sound amplification would be for the city to furnish
high quality sound equipment and retain an independent, experienced sound
technician for all performances at the bandshell. After an extensive search the
city hired a private sound company capable of meeting the needs of all the
varied users of the bandshell.
The Use Guidelines were promulgated on March 21, 1986. After learning that it
would be expected to comply with the guidelines at its upcoming annual
concert in May 1986, respondent returned to the District Court and filed a

Robson

493

The First Amendment

motion for an injunction against the enforcement of certain aspects of the
guidelines. The District Court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the soundamplification rule on May 1, 1986. Under the protection of the injunction, and
alone among users of the bandshell in the 1986 season, RAR was permitted to
use its own sound equipment and technician, just as it had done in prior years.
RAR's 1986 concert again generated complaints about excessive noise from
park users and nearby residents.
After the concert, respondent amended its complaint to seek damages and a
declaratory judgment striking down the guidelines as facially invalid. After
hearing five days of testimony about various aspects of the guidelines, the
District Court issued its decision upholding the sound-amplification guideline.
The court found that the city had been "motivated by a desire to obtain topflight sound equipment and experienced operators" in selecting an independent
contractor to provide the equipment and technician for bandshell events, and
that the performers who did use the city's sound system in the 1986 season, in
performances "which ran the full cultural gamut from grand opera to salsa to
reggae," were uniformly pleased with the quality of the sound provided.
Although the city's sound technician controlled both sound volume and sound
mix by virtue of his position at the mixing board, the court found that "[t]he
City's practice for events at the Bandshell is to give the sponsor autonomy with
respect to the sound mix: balancing treble with bass, highlighting a particular
instrument or voice, and the like," and that the city's sound technician "does all
he can to accommodate the sponsor's desires in those regards." Ibid. Even with
respect to volume control, the city's practice was to confer with the sponsor
before making any decision to turn the volume down. In some instances, as
with a New York Grand Opera performance, the sound technician
accommodated the performers' unique needs by integrating special
microphones with the city's equipment. The court specifically found that "[t]he
City's implementation of the Bandshell guidelines provides for a sound
amplification system capable of meeting RAR's technical needs and leaves
control of the sound `mix' in the hands of RAR." Applying this Court's threepart test for judging the constitutionality of government regulation of the time,
place, or manner of protected speech, the court found the city's regulation valid.
The Court of Appeals reversed. After recognizing that "[c]ontent neutral time,
place and manner regulations are permissible so long as they are narrowly
tailored to serve a substantial government interest and do not unreasonably
limit alternative avenues of expression," the court added the proviso that "the
method and extent of such regulation must be reasonable, that is, it must be
the least intrusive upon the freedom of expression as is reasonably necessary to
achieve a legitimate purpose of the regulation." Applying this test, the court
determined that the city's guideline was valid only to the extent necessary to
achieve the city's legitimate interest in controlling excessive volume, but found
there were various alternative means of controlling volume without also
intruding on respondent's ability to control the sound mix. For example, the
city could have directed respondent's sound technician to keep the volume
below specified levels. Alternatively, a volume-limiting device could have been
installed; and as a "last resort," the court suggested, "the plug can be pulled on
the sound to enforce the volume limit." In view of the potential availability of

Robson

494

The First Amendment

these seemingly less restrictive alternatives, the Court of Appeals concluded
that the sound-amplification guideline was invalid because the city had failed to
prove that its regulation "was the least intrusive means of regulating the
volume."
We granted certiorari to clarify the legal standard applicable to governmental
regulation of the time, place, or manner of protected speech. Because the Court
of Appeals erred in requiring the city to prove that its regulation was the least
intrusive means of furthering its legitimate governmental interests, and because
the ordinance is valid on its face, we now reverse.
II
Music is one of the oldest forms of human expression. From Plato's discourse in
the Republic to the totalitarian state in our own times, rulers have known its
capacity to appeal to the intellect and to the emotions, and have censored
musical compositions to serve the needs of the state. See 2 DIALOGUES OF PLATO,
REPUBLIC, bk. 3, pp. 231, 245-248 (B. Jowett transl., 4th ed. 1953) ("Our poets
must sing in another and a nobler strain"); Musical Freedom and Why Dictators
Fear It, N. Y. TIMES, Aug. 23, 1981, section 2, p. 1, col. 5; Soviet Schizophrenia
toward Stravinsky, N. Y. TIMES, June 26, 1982, section 1, p. 25, col. 2;
Symphonic Voice from China Is Heard Again, N. Y. TIMES, Oct. 11, 1987, section
2, p. 27, col. 1. The Constitution prohibits any like attempts in our own legal
order. Music, as a form of expression and communication, is protected under
the First Amendment. In the case before us the performances apparently
consisted of remarks by speakers, as well as rock music, but the case has been
presented as one in which the constitutional challenge is to the city's regulation
of the musical aspects of the concert; and, based on the principle we have
stated, the city's guideline must meet the demands of the First Amendment.
The parties do not appear to dispute that proposition.
We need not here discuss whether a municipality which owns a bandstand or
stage facility may exercise, in some circumstances, a proprietary right to select
performances and control their quality. See Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v.
Conrad (1975) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Though it did demonstrate its own
interest in the effort to insure high quality performances by providing the
equipment in question, the city justifies its guideline as a regulatory measure to
limit and control noise. Here the bandshell was open, apparently, to all
performers; and we decide the case as one in which the bandshell is a public
forum for performances in which the government's right to regulate expression
is subject to the protections of the First Amendment. Our cases make clear,
however, that even in a public forum the government may impose reasonable
restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided the
restrictions "are justified without reference to the content of the regulated
speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental
interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for
communication of the information." We consider these requirements in turn.

Robson

495

The First Amendment

A
The principal inquiry in determining content neutrality, in speech cases
generally and in time, place, or manner cases in particular, is whether the
government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with
the message it conveys. The government's purpose is the controlling
consideration. A regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of
expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some
speakers or messages but not others. Government regulation of expressive
activity is content neutral so long as it is "justified without reference to the
content of the regulated speech."
The principal justification for the sound-amplification guideline is the city's
desire to control noise levels at bandshell events, in order to retain the
character of the Sheep Meadow and its more sedate activities, and to avoid
undue intrusion into residential areas and other areas of the park. This
justification for the guideline "ha[s] nothing to do with content," and it satisfies
the requirement that time, place, or manner regulations be content neutral.
The only other justification offered below was the city's interest in "ensur[ing]
the quality of sound at Bandshell events." Respondent urges that this
justification is not content neutral because it is based upon the quality, and
thus the content, of the speech being regulated. In respondent's view, the city is
seeking to assert artistic control over performers at the bandshell by enforcing a
bureaucratically determined, value-laden conception of good sound. That all
performers who have used the city's sound equipment have been completely
satisfied is of no moment, respondent argues, because "[t]he First Amendment
does not permit and cannot tolerate state control of artistic expression merely
because the State claims that [its] efforts will lead to `top-quality' results."
While respondent's arguments that the government may not interfere with
artistic judgment may have much force in other contexts, they are inapplicable
to the facts of this case. The city has disclaimed in express terms any interest in
imposing its own view of appropriate sound mix on performers. To the contrary,
as the District Court found, the city requires its sound technician to defer to the
wishes of event sponsors concerning sound mix. On this record, the city's
concern with sound quality extends only to the clearly content-neutral goals of
ensuring adequate sound amplification and avoiding the volume problems
associated with inadequate sound mix. Any governmental attempt to serve
purely esthetic goals by imposing subjective standards of acceptable sound mix
on performers would raise serious First Amendment concerns, but this case
provides us with no opportunity to address those questions. As related above,
the District Court found that the city's equipment and its sound technician
could meet all of the standards requested by the performers, including RAR.
Respondent argues further that the guideline, even if not content based in
explicit terms, is nonetheless invalid on its face because it places unbridled
discretion in the hands of city officials charged with enforcing it. According to
respondent, there is nothing in the language of the guideline to prevent city
officials from selecting wholly inadequate sound equipment or technicians, or
even from varying the volume and quality of sound based on the message being
conveyed by the performers.

Robson

496

The First Amendment

As a threshold matter, it is far from clear that respondent should be permitted
to bring a facial challenge to this aspect of the regulation. Our cases permitting
facial challenges to regulations that allegedly grant officials unconstrained
authority to regulate speech have generally involved licensing schemes that
"ves[t] unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or
deny expressive activity." The grant of discretion that respondent seeks to
challenge here is of an entirely different, and lesser, order of magnitude,
because respondent does not suggest that city officials enjoy unfettered
discretion to deny bandshell permits altogether. Rather, respondent contends
only that the city, by exercising what is concededly its right to regulate
amplified sound, could choose to provide inadequate sound for performers
based on the content of their speech. Since respondent does not claim that city
officials enjoy unguided discretion to deny the right to speak altogether, it is
open to question whether respondent's claim falls within the narrow class of
permissible facial challenges to allegedly unconstrained grants of regulatory
authority.
We need not decide, however, whether the "extraordinary doctrine" that permits
facial challenges to some regulations of expression should be extended to the
circumstances of this case, for respondent's facial challenge fails on its merits.
The city's guideline states that its goals are to "provide the best sound for all
events" and to "insure appropriate sound quality balanced with respect for
nearby residential neighbors and the mayorally decreed quiet zone of [the]
Sheep Meadow." While these standards are undoubtedly flexible, and the
officials implementing them will exercise considerable discretion, perfect clarity
and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict
expressive activity. By its own terms the city's sound-amplification guideline
must be interpreted to forbid city officials purposely to select inadequate sound
systems or to vary the sound quality or volume based on the message being
delivered by performers. The guideline is not vulnerable to respondent's facial
challenge.
Even if the language of the guideline were not sufficient on its face to withstand
challenge, our ultimate conclusion would be the same, for the city has
interpreted the guideline in such a manner as to provide additional guidance to
the officials charged with its enforcement. The District Court expressly found
that the city's policy is to defer to the sponsor's desires concerning sound
quality. With respect to sound volume, the city retains ultimate control, but city
officials "mak[e] it a practice to confer with the sponsor if any questions of
excessive sound arise, before taking any corrective action." The city's goal of
ensuring that "the sound amplification [is] sufficient to reach all listeners within
the defined concertground," serves to limit further the discretion of the officials
on the scene. Administrative interpretation and implementation of a regulation
are, of course, highly relevant to our analysis, for "[i]n evaluating a facial
challenge to a state law, a federal court must . . . consider any limiting
construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered." Any
inadequacy on the face of the guideline would have been more than remedied by
the city's narrowing construction.

Robson

497

The First Amendment

B
The city's regulation is also "narrowly tailored to serve a significant
governmental interest." Despite respondent's protestations to the contrary, it
can no longer be doubted that government "ha[s] a substantial interest in
protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise." This interest is perhaps at its
greatest when government seeks to protect "`the well-being, tranquility, and
privacy of the home,'" but it is by no means limited to that context, for the
government may act to protect even such traditional public forums as city
streets and parks from excessive noise.
We think it also apparent that the city's interest in ensuring the sufficiency of
sound amplification at bandshell events is a substantial one. The record
indicates that inadequate sound amplification has had an adverse affect on the
ability of some audiences to hear and enjoy performances at the bandshell. The
city enjoys a substantial interest in ensuring the ability of its citizens to enjoy
whatever benefits the city parks have to offer, from amplified music to silent
meditation.
*** The Court of Appeals erred in sifting through all the available or imagined
alternative means of regulating sound volume in order to determine whether the
city's solution was "the least intrusive means" of achieving the desired end. This
"less-restrictive-alternative analysis . . . has never been a part of the inquiry
into the validity of a time, place, and manner regulation." Instead, our cases
quite clearly hold that restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected
speech are not invalid "simply because there is some imaginable alternative that
might be less burdensome on speech."
The Court of Appeals apparently drew its least-intrusive-means requirement
from United States v. O'Brien, the case in which we established the standard for
judging the validity of restrictions on expressive conduct. The court's reliance
was misplaced, however, for we have held that the O'Brien test "in the last
analysis is little, if any, different from the standard applied to time, place, or
manner restrictions." ***
Lest any confusion on the point remain, we reaffirm today that a regulation of
the time, place, or manner of protected speech must be narrowly tailored to
serve the government's legitimate, content-neutral interests but that it need not
be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of doing so. Rather, the
requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied "so long as the . . . regulation
promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less
effectively absent the regulation." To be sure, this standard does not mean that
a time, place, or manner regulation may burden substantially more speech than
is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests. Government may
not regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of the
burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals. So long as the means
chosen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the
government's interest, however, the regulation will not be invalid simply
because a court concludes that the government's interest could be adequately
served by some less-speech-restrictive alternative. "The validity of [time, place,
or manner] regulations does not turn on a judge's agreement with the
responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for

Robson

498

The First Amendment

promoting significant government interests" or the degree to which those
interests should be promoted.
It is undeniable that the city's substantial interest in limiting sound volume is
served in a direct and effective way by the requirement that the city's sound
technician control the mixing board during performances. Absent this
requirement, the city's interest would have been served less well, as is
evidenced by the complaints about excessive volume generated by respondent's
past concerts. The alternative regulatory methods hypothesized by the Court of
Appeals reflect nothing more than a disagreement with the city over how much
control of volume is appropriate or how that level of control is to be achieved.
The Court of Appeals erred in failing to defer to the city's reasonable
determination that its interest in controlling volume would be best served by
requiring bandshell performers to utilize the city's sound technician.
The city's second content-neutral justification for the guideline, that of ensuring
"that the sound amplification [is] sufficient to reach all listeners within the
defined concert-ground," also supports the city's choice of regulatory methods.
By providing competent sound technicians and adequate amplification
equipment, the city eliminated the problems of inexperienced technicians and
insufficient sound volume that had plagued some bandshell performers in the
past. No doubt this concern is not applicable to respondent's concerts, which
apparently were characterized by more-than-adequate sound amplification. But
that fact is beside the point, for the validity of the regulation depends on the
relation it bears to the overall problem the government seeks to correct, not on
the extent to which it furthers the government's interests in an individual case.
Here, the regulation's effectiveness must be judged by considering all the varied
groups that use the bandshell, and it is valid so long as the city could
reasonably have determined that its interests overall would be served less
effectively without the sound-amplification guideline than with it. Considering
these proffered justifications together, therefore, it is apparent that the
guideline directly furthers the city's legitimate governmental interests and that
those interests would have been less well served in the absence of the soundamplification guideline.
Respondent nonetheless argues that the sound-amplification guideline is not
narrowly tailored because, by placing control of sound mix in the hands of the
city's technician, the guideline sweeps far more broadly than is necessary to
further the city's legitimate concern with sound volume. According to
respondent, the guideline "targets . . . more than the exact source of the `evil' it
seeks to remedy."
If the city's regulatory scheme had a substantial deleterious effect on the ability
of bandshell performers to achieve the quality of sound they desired,
respondent's concerns would have considerable force. The District Court found,
however, that pursuant to city policy, the city's sound technician "give[s] the
sponsor autonomy with respect to the sound mix . . . [and] does all that he can
to accommodate the sponsor's desires in those regards." The court squarely
rejected respondent's claim that the city's "technician is not able properly to
implement a sponsor's instructions as to sound quality or mix," finding that
"[n]o evidence to that effect was offered at trial; as noted, the evidence is to the
contrary." In view of these findings, which were not disturbed by the Court of

Robson

499

The First Amendment

Appeals, we must conclude that the city's guideline has no material impact on
any performer's ability to exercise complete artistic control over sound quality.
Since the guideline allows the city to control volume without interfering with the
performer's desired sound mix, it is not "substantially broader than necessary"
to achieve the city's legitimate ends and thus it satisfies the requirement of
narrow tailoring.
C
The final requirement, that the guideline leave open ample alternative channels
of communication, is easily met. Indeed, in this respect the guideline is far less
restrictive than regulations we have upheld in other cases, for it does not
attempt to ban any particular manner or type of expression at a given place or
time. Rather, the guideline continues to permit expressive activity in the
bandshell, and has no effect on the quantity or content of that expression
beyond regulating the extent of amplification. That the city's limitations on
volume may reduce to some degree the potential audience for respondent's
speech is of no consequence, for there has been no showing that the remaining
avenues of communication are inadequate.
III
The city's sound-amplification guideline is narrowly tailored to serve the
substantial and content-neutral governmental interests of avoiding excessive
sound volume and providing sufficient amplification within the bandshell
concert ground, and the guideline leaves open ample channels of
communication. Accordingly, it is valid under the First Amendment as a
reasonable regulation of the place and manner of expression. The judgment of
the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN CONCURS IN THE RESULT [WITHOUT SEPARATE OPINION].
JUSTICE MARSHALL, WITH WHOM JUSTICE BRENNAN AND JUSTICE STEVENS JOIN,
DISSENTING.
No one can doubt that government has a substantial interest in regulating the
barrage of excessive sound that can plague urban life. Unfortunately, the
majority plays to our shared impatience with loud noise to obscure the damage
that it does to our First Amendment rights. Until today, a key safeguard of free
speech has been government's obligation to adopt the least intrusive restriction
necessary to achieve its goals. By abandoning the requirement that time, place,
and manner regulations must be narrowly tailored, the majority replaces
constitutional scrutiny with mandatory deference. The majority's willingness to
give government officials a free hand in achieving their policy ends extends so
far as to permit, in this case, government control of speech in advance of its
dissemination. Because New York City's Use Guidelines (Guidelines) are not
narrowly tailored to serve its interest in regulating loud noise, and because they
constitute an impermissible prior restraint, I dissent.
I

The First Amendment

The majority sets forth the appropriate standard for assessing the
constitutionality of the Guidelines. A time, place, and manner regulation of
expression must be content neutral, serve a significant government interest, be
narrowly tailored to serve that interest, and leave open ample alternative
channels of communication. The Guidelines indisputably are content neutral as
they apply to all bandshell users irrespective of the message of their music.
They also serve government's significant interest in limiting loud noise in public
places by giving the city exclusive control of all sound equipment.
My complaint is with the majority's serious distortion of the narrow tailoring
requirement. Our cases have not, as the majority asserts, "clearly" rejected a
less-restrictive-alternative test. *** In Schneider[ v. State (1939)], for example,
the Court invalidated a ban on handbill distribution on public streets,
notwithstanding that it was the most effective means of serving government's
legitimate interest in minimizing litter, noise, and traffic congestion, and in
preventing fraud. The Court concluded that punishing those who actually litter
or perpetrate frauds was a much less intrusive, albeit not quite as effective,
means to serve those significant interests.
The Court's past concern for the extent to which a regulation burdens speech
more than would a satisfactory alternative is noticeably absent from today's
decision. The majority requires only that government show that its interest
cannot be served as effectively without the challenged restriction. It will be
enough, therefore, that the challenged regulation advances the government's
interest only in the slightest, for any differential burden on speech that results
does not enter the calculus. Despite its protestations to the contrary, the
majority thus has abandoned the requirement that restrictions on speech be
narrowly tailored in any ordinary use of the phrase. Indeed, after today's
decision, a city could claim that bans on handbill distribution or on door-todoor solicitation are the most effective means of avoiding littering and fraud, or
that a ban on loudspeakers and radios in a public park is the most effective
means of avoiding loud noise. Logically extended, the majority's analysis would
permit such far-reaching restrictions on speech. ***
Had the majority not abandoned the narrow tailoring requirement, the
Guidelines could not possibly survive constitutional scrutiny. Government's
interest in avoiding loud sounds cannot justify giving government total control
over sound equipment, any more than its interest in avoiding litter could justify
a ban on handbill distribution. In both cases, government's legitimate goals can
be effectively and less intrusively served by directly punishing the evil - the
persons responsible for excessive sounds and the persons who litter. Indeed,
the city concedes that it has an ordinance generally limiting noise but has
chosen not to enforce it.
By holding that the Guidelines are valid time, place, and manner restrictions,
notwithstanding the availability of less intrusive but effective means of
controlling volume, the majority deprives the narrow tailoring requirement of all
meaning. Today, the majority enshrines efficacy but sacrifices free speech.
II

The First Amendment

The majority's conclusion that the city's exclusive control of sound equipment is
constitutional is deeply troubling for another reason. It places the Court's
imprimatur on a quintessential prior restraint, incompatible with fundamental
First Amendment values. ***
III
Today's decision has significance far beyond the world of rock music.
Government no longer need balance the effectiveness of regulation with the
burdens on free speech. After today, government need only assert that it is most
effective to control speech in advance of its expression. Because such a result
eviscerates the First Amendment, I dissent.

ROBERTS, C. J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH GINSBURG, BREYER,
SOTOMAYOR, AND KAGAN, JJ., JOINED. SCALIA, J., FILED AN OPINION CONCURRING IN THE
JUDGMENT, IN WHICH KENNEDY AND THOMAS, JJ., JOINED. ALITO, J., FILED AN OPINION
CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
A Massachusetts statute makes it a crime to knowingly stand on a "public way
or sidewalk" within 35 feet of an entrance or driveway to any place, other than a
hospital, where abortions are performed. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §§120E½(a),
(b) (West 2012). Petitioners are individuals who approach and talk to women
outside such facilities, attempting to dissuade them from having abortions. The
statute prevents petitioners from doing so near the facilities' entrances. The
question presented is whether the statute violates the First Amendment.
I
A
In 2000, the Massachusetts Legislature enacted the Massachusetts
Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act, Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½
(West 2000). The law was designed to address clashes between abortion
opponents and advocates of abortion rights that were occurring outside clinics
where abortions were performed. The Act established a defined area with an 18foot radius around the entrances and driveways of such facilities. §120E½(b).
Anyone could enter that area, but once within it, no one (other than certain
exempt individuals) could knowingly approach within six feet of another person-unless that person consented--"for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill
to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling
with such other person." A separate provision subjected to criminal punishment
anyone who "knowingly obstructs, detains, hinders, impedes or blocks another
person's entry to or exit from a reproductive health care facility." §120E½(e).
The statute was modeled on a similar Colorado law that this Court had upheld
in Hill v. Colorado (2000). Relying on Hill, the United States Court of Appeals for

Robson

502

The First Amendment

the First Circuit sustained the Massachusetts statute against a First
Amendment challenge.
By 2007, some Massachusetts legislators and law enforcement officials had
come to regard the 2000 statute as inadequate. At legislative hearings, multiple
witnesses recounted apparent violations of the law. Massachusetts Attorney
General Martha Coakley, for example, testified that protestors violated the
statute "on a routine basis." To illustrate this claim, she played a video
depicting protestors approaching patients and clinic staff within the buffer
zones, ostensibly without the latter individuals' consent. Clinic employees and
volunteers also testified that protestors congregated near the doors and in the
driveways of the clinics, with the result that prospective patients occasionally
retreated from the clinics rather than try to make their way to the clinic
entrances or parking lots.
Captain William B. Evans of the Boston Police Department, however, testified
that his officers had made "no more than five or so arrests" at the Planned
Parenthood clinic in Boston and that what few prosecutions had been brought
were unsuccessful. Witnesses attributed the dearth of enforcement to the
difficulty of policing the six-foot no-approach zones. Captain Evans testified
that the 18-foot zones were so crowded with protestors that they resembled "a
goalie's crease," making it hard to determine whether a protestor had
deliberately approached a patient or, if so, whether the patient had consented.
For similar reasons, Attorney General Coakley concluded that the six-foot noapproach zones were "unenforceable." What the police needed, she said, was a
fixed buffer zone around clinics that protestors could not enter. Captain Evans
agreed, explaining that such a zone would "make our job so much easier."
To address these concerns, the Massachusetts Legislature amended the statute
in 2007, replacing the six-foot no-approach zones (within the 18-foot area) with
a 35-foot fixed buffer zone from which individuals are categorically excluded.
The statute now provides:
"No person shall knowingly enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk adjacent
to a reproductive health care facility within a radius of 35 feet of any portion of
an entrance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health care facility or within the
area within a rectangle created by extending the outside boundaries of any
entrance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health care facility in straight lines
to the point where such lines intersect the sideline of the street in front of such
entrance, exit or driveway."

Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(b) (West 2012).
A "reproductive health care facility," in turn, is defined as "a place, other than
within or upon the grounds of a hospital, where abortions are offered or
performed." §120E½(a).
The 35-foot buffer zone applies only "during a facility's business hours," and the
area must be "clearly marked and posted." §120E½(c). In practice, facilities
typically mark the zones with painted arcs and posted signs on adjacent
sidewalks and streets. A first violation of the statute is punishable by a fine of
up to $500, up to three months in prison, or both, while a subsequent offense
is punishable by a fine of between $500 and $5,000, up to two and a half years
in prison, or both. §120E½(d).

Robson

503

The First Amendment

The Act exempts four classes of individuals: (1) "persons entering or leaving
such facility"; (2) "employees or agents of such facility acting within the scope of
their employment"; (3) "law enforcement, ambulance, firefighting, construction,
utilities, public works and other municipal agents acting within the scope of
their employment"; and (4) "persons using the public sidewalk or street right-ofway adjacent to such facility solely for the purpose of reaching a destination
other than such facility." §120E½(b)(1)-(4). The legislature also retained the
separate provision from the 2000 version that proscribes the knowing
obstruction of access to a facility. §120E½(e).
B
Some of the individuals who stand outside Massachusetts abortion clinics are
fairly described as protestors, who express their moral or religious opposition to
abortion through signs and chants or, in some cases, more aggressive methods
such as face-to-face confrontation. Petitioners take a different tack. They
attempt to engage women approaching the clinics in what they call "sidewalk
counseling," which involves offering information about alternatives to abortion
and help pursuing those options. Petitioner Eleanor McCullen, for instance, will
typically initiate a conversation this way: "Good morning, may I give you my
literature? Is there anything I can do for you? I'm available if you have any
questions." If the woman seems receptive, McCullen will provide additional
information. McCullen and the other petitioners consider it essential to
maintain a caring demeanor, a calm tone of voice, and direct eye contact during
these exchanges. Such interactions, petitioners believe, are a much more
effective means of dissuading women from having abortions than
confrontational methods such as shouting or brandishing signs, which in
petitioners' view tend only to antagonize their intended audience. In unrefuted
testimony, petitioners say they have collectively persuaded hundreds of women
to forgo abortions.
The buffer zones have displaced petitioners from their previous positions
outside the clinics. McCullen offers counseling outside a Planned Parenthood
clinic in Boston, as do petitioners Jean Zarrella and Eric Cadin. Petitioner
Gregory Smith prays the rosary there. The clinic occupies its own building on a
street corner. Its main door is recessed into an open foyer, approximately 12
feet back from the public sidewalk. Before the Act was amended to create the
buffer zones, petitioners stood near the entryway to the foyer. Now a buffer
zone--marked by a painted arc and a sign--surrounds the entrance. This zone
extends 23 feet down the sidewalk in one direction, 26 feet in the other, and
outward just one foot short of the curb. The clinic's entrance adds another
seven feet to the width of the zone. The upshot is that petitioners are effectively
excluded from a 56-foot-wide expanse of the public sidewalk in front of the
clinic.
Petitioners Mark Bashour and Nancy Clark offer counseling and information
outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Worcester. Unlike the Boston clinic, the
Worcester clinic sits well back from the public street and sidewalks. Patients
enter the clinic in one of two ways. Those arriving on foot turn off the public
sidewalk and walk down a nearly 54-foot-long private walkway to the main
entrance. More than 85% of patients, however, arrive by car, turning onto the

Robson

504

The First Amendment

clinic's driveway from the street, parking in a private lot, and walking to the
main entrance on a private walkway.
Bashour and Clark would like to stand where the private walkway or driveway
intersects the sidewalk and offer leaflets to patients as they walk or drive by.
But a painted arc extends from the private walkway 35 feet down the sidewalk
in either direction and outward nearly to the curb on the opposite side of the
street. Another arc surrounds the driveway's entrance, covering more than 93
feet of the sidewalk (including the width of the driveway) and extending across
the street and nearly six feet onto the sidewalk on the opposite side. Bashour
and Clark must now stand either some distance down the sidewalk from the
private walkway and driveway or across the street.
Petitioner Cyril Shea stands outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Springfield,
which, like the Worcester clinic, is set back from the public streets.
Approximately 90% of patients arrive by car and park in the private lots
surrounding the clinic. Shea used to position himself at an entrance to one of
the five driveways leading to the parking lots. Painted arcs now surround the
entrances, each spanning approximately 100 feet of the sidewalk parallel to the
street (again, including the width of the driveways) and extending outward well
into the street. Like petitioners at the Worcester clinic, Shea now stands far
down the sidewalk from the driveway entrances.
Petitioners at all three clinics claim that the buffer zones have considerably
hampered their counseling efforts. Although they have managed to conduct
some counseling and to distribute some literature outside the buffer zones-particularly at the Boston clinic--they say they have had many fewer
conversations and distributed many fewer leaflets since the zones went into
effect.
The second statutory exemption allows clinic employees and agents acting
within the scope of their employment to enter the buffer zones. Relying on this
exemption, the Boston clinic uses "escorts" to greet women as they approach
the clinic, accompanying them through the zones to the clinic entrance.
Petitioners claim that the escorts sometimes thwart petitioners' attempts to
communicate with patients by blocking petitioners from handing literature to
patients, telling patients not to "pay any attention" or "listen to" petitioners, and
disparaging petitioners as "crazy."
C
In January 2008, petitioners sued Attorney General Coakley and other
Commonwealth officials. They sought to enjoin enforcement of the Act, alleging
that it violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, both on its face and as
applied to them. The District Court denied petitioners' facial challenge after a
bench trial based on a stipulated record.
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.
Relying extensively on its previous decisions upholding the 2000 version of the
Act, the court upheld the 2007 version as a reasonable "time, place, and
manner" regulation under the test set forth in Ward v. Rock Against Racism
(1989). It also rejected petitioners' arguments that the Act was substantially
overbroad, void for vagueness, and an impermissible prior restraint.

Robson

505

The First Amendment

The case then returned to the District Court, which held that the First Circuit's
decision foreclosed all but one of petitioners' as-applied challenges. After
another bench trial, it denied the remaining as-applied challenge, finding that
the Act left petitioners ample alternative channels of communication. The Court
of Appeals once again affirmed.
We granted certiorari.
II
By its very terms, the Massachusetts Act regulates access to "public way[s]" and
"sidewalk[s]." Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(b) (Supp. 2007). Such areas
occupy a "special position in terms of First Amendment protection" because of
their historic role as sites for discussion and debate. These places--which we
have labeled "traditional public fora"--" 'have immemorially been held in trust
for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of
assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public
questions.' "
It is no accident that public streets and sidewalks have developed as venues for
the exchange of ideas. Even today, they remain one of the few places where a
speaker can be confident that he is not simply preaching to the choir. With
respect to other means of communication, an individual confronted with an
uncomfortable message can always turn the page, change the channel, or leave
the Web site. Not so on public streets and sidewalks. There, a listener often
encounters speech he might otherwise tune out. In light of the First
Amendment's purpose "to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in
which truth will ultimately prevail," this aspect of traditional public fora is a
virtue, not a vice.
In short, traditional public fora are areas that have historically been open to the
public for speech activities. Thus, even though the Act says nothing about
speech on its face, there is no doubt--and respondents do not dispute--that it
restricts access to traditional public fora and is therefore subject to First
Amendment scrutiny. See Brief for Respondents 26 (although "[b]y its terms,
the Act regulates only conduct," it "incidentally regulates the place and time of
protected speech").
Consistent with the traditionally open character of public streets and sidewalks,
we have held that the government's ability to restrict speech in such locations is
"very limited." In particular, the guiding First Amendment principle that the
"government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its
ideas, its subject matter, or its content" applies with full force in a traditional
public forum. As a general rule, in such a forum the government may not
"selectively . . . shield the public from some kinds of speech on the ground that
they are more offensive than others."
We have, however, afforded the government somewhat wider leeway to regulate
features of speech unrelated to its content. "[E]ven in a public forum the
government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner
of protected speech, provided the restrictions 'are justified without reference to
the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a

Robson

506

The First Amendment

significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative
channels for communication of the information.' " Ward.
While the parties agree that this test supplies the proper framework for
assessing the constitutionality of the Massachusetts Act, they disagree about
whether the Act satisfies the test's three requirements.
III
Petitioners contend that the Act is not content neutral for two independent
reasons: First, they argue that it discriminates against abortion-related speech
because it establishes buffer zones only at clinics that perform abortions.
Second, petitioners contend that the Act, by exempting clinic employees and
agents, favors one viewpoint about abortion over the other. If either of these
arguments is correct, then the Act must satisfy strict scrutiny--that is, it must
be the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest.
Respondents do not argue that the Act can survive this exacting standard.
Justice Scalia [concurring] objects to our decision to consider whether the
statute is content based and thus subject to strict scrutiny, given that we
ultimately conclude that it is not narrowly tailored. But we think it
unexceptional to perform the first part of a multipart constitutional analysis
first. The content-neutrality prong of the Ward test is logically antecedent to the
narrow-tailoring prong, because it determines the appropriate level of scrutiny.
It is not unusual for the Court to proceed sequentially in applying a
constitutional test, even when the preliminary steps turn out not to be
dispositive. See, e.g., Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project (2010) (concluding that
a law was content based even though it ultimately survived strict scrutiny).
The Court does sometimes assume, without deciding, that a law is subject to a
less stringent level of scrutiny, as we did earlier this Term in McCutcheon v.
Federal Election Commission (2014) (plurality opinion). But the distinction
between that case and this one seems clear: Applying any standard of review
other than intermediate scrutiny in McCutcheon--the standard that was
assumed to apply--would have required overruling a precedent. There is no
similar reason to forgo the ordinary order of operations in this case.
At the same time, there is good reason to address content neutrality. In
discussing whether the Act is narrowly tailored, we identify a number of lessrestrictive alternative measures that the Massachusetts Legislature might have
adopted. Some apply only at abortion clinics, which raises the question whether
those provisions are content neutral. While we need not (and do not) endorse
any of those measures, it would be odd to consider them as possible
alternatives if they were presumptively unconstitutional because they were
content based and thus subject to strict scrutiny.
A
The Act applies only at a "reproductive health care facility," defined as "a place,
other than within or upon the grounds of a hospital, where abortions are offered
or performed." Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(a). Given this definition,
petitioners argue, "virtually all speech affected by the Act is speech concerning
abortion," thus rendering the Act content based.

Robson

507

The First Amendment

We disagree. To begin, the Act does not draw content-based distinctions on its
face. Contrast Boos v. Barry (1988) (ordinance prohibiting the display within
500 feet of a foreign embassy of any sign that tends to bring the foreign
government into " 'public odium' " or " 'public disrepute' "); Carey v. Brown
(1980) (statute prohibiting all residential picketing except "peaceful labor
picketing"). The Act would be content based if it required "enforcement
authorities" to "examine the content of the message that is conveyed to
determine whether" a violation has occurred. But it does not. Whether
petitioners violate the Act "depends" not "on what they say," Humanitarian Law
Project, but simply on where they say it. Indeed, petitioners can violate the Act
merely by standing in a buffer zone, without displaying a sign or uttering a
word.
It is true, of course, that by limiting the buffer zones to abortion clinics, the Act
has the "inevitable effect" of restricting abortion-related speech more than
speech on other subjects. But a facially neutral law does not become content
based simply because it may disproportionately affect speech on certain topics.
On the contrary, "[a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of
expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some
speakers or messages but not others." Ward. The question in such a case is
whether the law is " 'justified without reference to the content of the regulated
speech.' ".
The Massachusetts Act is. Its stated purpose is to "increase forthwith public
safety at reproductive health care facilities." Respondents have articulated
similar purposes before this Court--namely, "public safety, patient access to
healthcare, and the unobstructed use of public sidewalks and roadways." It is
not the case [as Justice Scalia argues] that "[e]very objective indication shows
that the provision's primary purpose is to restrict speech that opposes abortion".
We have previously deemed the foregoing concerns to be content neutral.
Obstructed access and congested sidewalks are problems no matter what
caused them. A group of individuals can obstruct clinic access and clog
sidewalks just as much when they loiter as when they protest abortion or
counsel patients.
To be clear, the Act would not be content neutral if it were concerned with
undesirable effects that arise from "the direct impact of speech on its audience"
or "[l]isteners' reactions to speech."
If, for example, the speech outside
Massachusetts abortion clinics caused offense or made listeners uncomfortable,
such offense or discomfort would not give the Commonwealth a content-neutral
justification to restrict the speech. All of the problems identified by the
Commonwealth here, however, arise irrespective of any listener's reactions.
Whether or not a single person reacts to abortion protestors' chants or
petitioners' counseling, large crowds outside abortion clinics can still
compromise public safety, impede access, and obstruct sidewalks.
Petitioners do not really dispute that the Commonwealth's interests in ensuring
safety and preventing obstruction are, as a general matter, content neutral. But
petitioners note that these interests "apply outside every building in the State
that hosts any activity that might occasion protest or comment," not just
abortion clinics. By choosing to pursue these interests only at abortion clinics,

Robson

508

The First Amendment

petitioners argue, the Massachusetts Legislature evinced a purpose to "single[ ]
out for regulation speech about one particular topic: abortion."
We cannot infer such a purpose from the Act's limited scope. The broad reach of
a statute can help confirm that it was not enacted to burden a narrower
category of disfavored speech. See Kagan, Private Speech, Public Purpose: The
Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine, 63 U. CHI. L. REV. 413,
451-452 (1996). At the same time, however, "States adopt laws to address the
problems that confront them. The First Amendment does not require States to
regulate for problems that do not exist." The Massachusetts Legislature
amended the Act in 2007 in response to a problem that was, in its experience,
limited to abortion clinics. There was a record of crowding, obstruction, and
even violence outside such clinics. There were apparently no similar recurring
problems associated with other kinds of healthcare facilities, let alone with
"every building in the State that hosts any activity that might occasion protest
or comment." In light of the limited nature of the problem, it was reasonable for
the Massachusetts Legislature to enact a limited solution. When selecting
among various options for combating a particular problem, legislatures should
be encouraged to choose the one that restricts less speech, not more.
Justice Scalia objects that the statute does restrict more speech than necessary,
because "only one [Massachusetts abortion clinic] is known to have been beset
by the problems that the statute supposedly addresses." But there are no
grounds for inferring content-based discrimination here simply because the
legislature acted with respect to abortion facilities generally rather than
proceeding on a facility-by-facility basis. On these facts, the poor fit noted by
Justice Scalia goes to the question of narrow tailoring, which we consider below.
B
Petitioners also argue that the Act is content based because it exempts four
classes of individuals, Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §§120E½(b)(1)-(4), one of
which comprises "employees or agents of [a reproductive healthcare] facility
acting within the scope of their employment." §120E½(b)(2). This exemption,
petitioners say, favors one side in the abortion debate and thus constitutes
viewpoint discrimination--an "egregious form of content discrimination,"
Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995). In particular,
petitioners argue that the exemption allows clinic employees and agents-including the volunteers who "escort" patients arriving at the Boston clinic--to
speak inside the buffer zones.
It is of course true that "an exemption from an otherwise permissible regulation
of speech may represent a governmental 'attempt to give one side of a debatable
public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people.' " City of
Ladue v. Gilleo (1994). At least on the record before us, however, the statutory
exemption for clinic employees and agents acting within the scope of their
employment does not appear to be such an attempt.
There is nothing inherently suspect about providing some kind of exemption to
allow individuals who work at the clinics to enter or remain within the buffer
zones. In particular, the exemption cannot be regarded as simply a carve-out
for the clinic escorts; it also covers employees such as the maintenance worker
shoveling a snowy sidewalk or the security guard patrolling a clinic entrance.

Robson

509

The First Amendment

Given the need for an exemption for clinic employees, the "scope of their
employment" qualification simply ensures that the exemption is limited to its
purpose of allowing the employees to do their jobs. It performs the same
function as the identical "scope of their employment" restriction on the
exemption for "law enforcement, ambulance, fire-fighting, construction, utilities,
public works and other municipal agents." §120E½(b)(3). Contrary to the
suggestion of Justice Scalia, there is little reason to suppose that the
Massachusetts Legislature intended to incorporate a common law doctrine
developed for determining vicarious liability in tort when it used the phrase
"scope of their employment" for the wholly different purpose of defining the
scope of an exemption to a criminal statute. The limitation instead makes clear-with respect to both clinic employees and municipal agents--that exempted
individuals are allowed inside the zones only to perform those acts authorized
by their employers. There is no suggestion in the record that any of the clinics
authorize their employees to speak about abortion in the buffer zones. The
"scope of their employment" limitation thus seems designed to protect against
exactly the sort of conduct that petitioners and Justice Scalia fear.
Petitioners did testify in this litigation about instances in which escorts at the
Boston clinic had expressed views about abortion to the women they were
accompanying, thwarted petitioners' attempts to speak and hand literature to
the women, and disparaged petitioners in various ways. It is unclear from
petitioners' testimony whether these alleged incidents occurred within the
buffer zones. There is no viewpoint discrimination problem if the incidents
occurred outside the zones because petitioners are equally free to say whatever
they would like in that area.
Even assuming the incidents occurred inside the zones, the record does not
suggest that they involved speech within the scope of the escorts' employment.
If the speech was beyond the scope of their employment, then each of the
alleged incidents would violate the Act's express terms. Petitioners' complaint
would then be that the police were failing to enforce the Act equally against
clinic escorts. While such allegations might state a claim of official viewpoint
discrimination, that would not go to the validity of the Act. In any event,
petitioners nowhere allege selective enforcement.
It would be a very different question if it turned out that a clinic authorized
escorts to speak about abortion inside the buffer zones. In that case, the escorts
would not seem to be violating the Act because the speech would be within the
scope of their employment. The Act's exemption for clinic employees would then
facilitate speech on only one side of the abortion debate--a clear form of
viewpoint discrimination that would support an as-applied challenge to the
buffer zone at that clinic. But the record before us contains insufficient
evidence to show that the exemption operates in this way at any of the clinics,
perhaps because the clinics do not want to doom the Act by allowing their
employees to speak about abortion within the buffer zones.4
We thus conclude that the Act is neither content nor viewpoint based and
therefore need not be analyzed under strict scrutiny.

Even though the Act is content neutral, it still must be "narrowly tailored to
serve a significant governmental interest." Ward. The tailoring requirement does
not simply guard against an impermissible desire to censor. The government
may attempt to suppress speech not only because it disagrees with the message
being expressed, but also for mere convenience. Where certain speech is
associated with particular problems, silencing the speech is sometimes the path
of least resistance. But by demanding a close fit between ends and means, the
tailoring requirement prevents the government from too readily "sacrific[ing]
speech for efficiency."
For a content-neutral time, place, or manner regulation to be narrowly tailored,
it must not "burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the
government's legitimate interests." Ward. Such a regulation, unlike a contentbased restriction of speech, "need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive
means of" serving the government's interests. But the government still "may not
regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of the burden
on speech does not serve to advance its goals."
A
As noted, respondents claim that the Act promotes "public safety, patient
access to healthcare, and the unobstructed use of public sidewalks and
roadways." Petitioners do not dispute the significance of these interests. We
have, moreover, previously recognized the legitimacy of the government's
interests in "ensuring public safety and order, promoting the free flow of traffic
on streets and sidewalks, protecting property rights, and protecting a woman's
freedom to seek pregnancy-related services." The buffer zones clearly serve
these interests.
At the same time, the buffer zones impose serious burdens on petitioners'
speech. At each of the three Planned Parenthood clinics where petitioners
attempt to counsel patients, the zones carve out a significant portion of the
adjacent public sidewalks, pushing petitioners well back from the clinics'
entrances and driveways. The zones thereby compromise petitioners' ability to
initiate the close, personal conversations that they view as essential to
"sidewalk counseling."
For example, in uncontradicted testimony, McCullen explained that she often
cannot distinguish patients from passersby outside the Boston clinic in time to
initiate a conversation before they enter the buffer zone. And even when she
does manage to begin a discussion outside the zone, she must stop abruptly at
its painted border, which she believes causes her to appear "untrustworthy" or
"suspicious." Given these limitations, McCullen is often reduced to raising her
voice at patients from outside the zone--a mode of communication sharply at
odds with the compassionate message she wishes to convey. Clark gave similar
testimony about her experience at the Worcester clinic.
These burdens on petitioners' speech have clearly taken their toll. Although
McCullen claims that she has persuaded about 80 women not to terminate
their pregnancies since the 2007 amendment, she also says that she reaches
"far fewer people" than she did before the amendment. Zarrella reports an even

Robson

511

The First Amendment

more precipitous decline in her success rate: She estimated having about 100
successful interactions over the years before the 2007 amendment, but not a
single one since. And as for the Worcester clinic, Clark testified that "only one
woman out of 100 will make the effort to walk across [the street] to speak with
[her]."
The buffer zones have also made it substantially more difficult for petitioners to
distribute literature to arriving patients. As explained, because petitioners in
Boston cannot readily identify patients before they enter the zone, they often
cannot approach them in time to place literature near their hands--the most
effective means of getting the patients to accept it. In Worcester and Springfield,
the zones have pushed petitioners so far back from the clinics' driveways that
they can no longer even attempt to offer literature as drivers turn into the
parking lots. In short, the Act operates to deprive petitioners of their two
primary methods of communicating with patients.
The Court of Appeals and respondents are wrong to downplay these burdens on
petitioners' speech. As the Court of Appeals saw it, the Constitution does not
accord "special protection" to close conversations or "handbilling." But while the
First Amendment does not guarantee a speaker the right to any particular form
of expression, some forms--such as normal conversation and leafletting on a
public sidewalk--have historically been more closely associated with the
transmission of ideas than others.
In the context of petition campaigns, we have observed that "one-on-one
communication" is "the most effective, fundamental, and perhaps economical
avenue of political discourse." And "handing out leaflets in the advocacy of a
politically controversial viewpoint . . . is the essence of First Amendment
expression"; "[n]o form of speech is entitled to greater constitutional protection."
When the government makes it more difficult to engage in these modes of
communication, it imposes an especially significant First Amendment burden.
Respondents also emphasize that the Act does not prevent petitioners from
engaging in various forms of "protest"--such as chanting slogans and displaying
signs--outside the buffer zones. That misses the point. Petitioners are not
protestors. They seek not merely to express their opposition to abortion, but to
inform women of various alternatives and to provide help in pursuing them.
Petitioners believe that they can accomplish this objective only through
personal, caring, consensual conversations. And for good reason: It is easier to
ignore a strained voice or a waving hand than a direct greeting or an
outstretched arm. While the record indicates that petitioners have been able to
have a number of quiet conversations outside the buffer zones, respondents
have not refuted petitioners' testimony that the conversations have been far less
frequent and far less successful since the buffer zones were instituted. It is thus
no answer to say that petitioners can still be "seen and heard" by women within
the buffer zones. If all that the women can see and hear are vociferous
opponents of abortion, then the buffer zones have effectively stifled petitioners'
message.
Finally, respondents suggest that, at the Worcester and Springfield clinics,
petitioners are prevented from communicating with patients not by the buffer
zones but by the fact that most patients arrive by car and park in the clinics'

Robson

512

The First Amendment

private lots. It is true that the layout of the two clinics would prevent petitioners
from approaching the clinics' doorways, even without the buffer zones. But
petitioners do not claim a right to trespass on the clinics' property. They instead
claim a right to stand on the public sidewalks by the driveway as cars turn into
the parking lot. Before the buffer zones, they could do so. Now they must stand
a substantial distance away. The Act alone is responsible for that restriction on
their ability to convey their message.
B

The buffer zones burden substantially more speech than necessary to achieve
the Commonwealth's asserted interests. At the outset, we note that the Act is
truly exceptional: Respondents and their amici identify no other State with a law
that creates fixed buffer zones around abortion clinics. That of course does not
mean that the law is invalid. It does, however, raise concern that the
Commonwealth has too readily forgone options that could serve its interests
just as well, without substantially burdening the kind of speech in which
petitioners wish to engage.
That is the case here. The Commonwealth's interests include ensuring public
safety outside abortion clinics, preventing harassment and intimidation of
patients and clinic staff, and combating deliberate obstruction of clinic
entrances. The Act itself contains a separate provision, subsection (e)-unchallenged by petitioners--that prohibits much of this conduct. That
provision subjects to criminal punishment "[a]ny person who knowingly
obstructs, detains, hinders, impedes or blocks another person's entry to or exit
from a reproductive health care facility." Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(e).
If Massachusetts determines that broader prohibitions along the same lines are
necessary, it could enact legislation similar to the federal Freedom of Access to
Clinic Entrances Act of 1994 (FACE Act), 18 U. S. C. §248(a)(1), which subjects
to both criminal and civil penalties anyone who "by force or threat of force or by
physical obstruction, intentionally injures, intimidates or interferes with or
attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person because that person
is or has been, or in order to intimidate such person or any other person or any
class of persons from, obtaining or providing reproductive health services."
Some dozen other States have done so. If the Commonwealth is particularly
concerned about harassment, it could also consider an ordinance such as the
one adopted in New York City that not only prohibits obstructing access to a
clinic, but also makes it a crime "to follow and harass another person within 15
feet of the premises of a reproductive health care facility." N. Y. C. Admin. Code
§8-803(a)(3) (2014).
The Commonwealth points to a substantial public safety risk created when
protestors obstruct driveways leading to the clinics. That is, however, an
example of its failure to look to less intrusive means of addressing its concerns.
Any such obstruction can readily be addressed through existing local
ordinances. See, e.g., Worcester, Mass., Revised Ordinances of 2008, ch. 12,
§25(b) ("No person shall stand, or place any obstruction of any kind, upon any
street, sidewalk or crosswalk in such a manner as to obstruct a free passage for
travelers thereon"); Boston, Mass., Municipal Code, ch. 16-41.2(d) (2013) ("No

Robson

513

The First Amendment

person shall solicit while walking on, standing on or going into any street or
highway used for motor vehicle travel, or any area appurtenant thereto
(including medians, shoulder areas, bicycle lanes, ramps and exit ramps)").
All of the foregoing measures are, of course, in addition to available generic
criminal statutes forbidding assault, breach of the peace, trespass, vandalism,
and the like.
In addition, subsection (e) of the Act, the FACE Act, and the New York City antiharassment ordinance are all enforceable not only through criminal
prosecutions but also through public and private civil actions for injunctions
and other equitable relief. See Mass. Gen. Laws §120E½(f); 18 U. S. C.
§248(c)(1); N. Y. C. Admin. Code §§8-804, 8-805. We have previously noted the
First Amendment virtues of targeted injunctions as alternatives to broad,
prophylactic measures. Such an injunction "regulates the activities, and
perhaps the speech, of a group," but only "because of the group's past actions in
the context of a specific dispute between real parties." Moreover, given the
equitable nature of injunctive relief, courts can tailor a remedy to ensure that it
restricts no more speech than necessary. In short, injunctive relief focuses on
the precise individuals and the precise conduct causing a particular problem.
The Act, by contrast, categorically excludes non-exempt individuals from the
buffer zones, unnecessarily sweeping in innocent individuals and their speech.
The Commonwealth also asserts an interest in preventing congestion in front of
abortion clinics. According to respondents, even when individuals do not
deliberately obstruct access to clinics, they can inadvertently do so simply by
gathering in large numbers. But the Commonwealth could address that
problem through more targeted means. Some localities, for example, have
ordinances that require crowds blocking a clinic entrance to disperse when
ordered to do so by the police, and that forbid the individuals to reassemble
within a certain distance of the clinic for a certain period. We upheld a similar
law forbidding three or more people “to congregate within 500 feet of [a foreign
embassy], and refuse to disperse after having been ordered so to do by the
police.”
And to the extent the Commonwealth argues that even these types of laws are
ineffective, it has another problem. The portions of the record that respondents
cite to support the anticongestion interest pertain mainly to one place at one
time: the Boston Planned Parenthood clinic on Saturday mornings.
Respondents point us to no evidence that individuals regularly gather at other
clinics, or at other times in Boston, in sufficiently large groups to obstruct
access. For a problem shown to arise only once a week in one city at one clinic,
creating 35-foot buffer zones at every clinic across the Commonwealth is hardly
a narrowly tailored solution.
The point is not that Massachusetts must enact all or even any of the proposed
measures discussed above. The point is instead that the Commonwealth has
available to it a variety of approaches that appear capable of serving its
interests, without excluding individuals from areas historically open for speech
and debate.

The First Amendment

Respondents have but one reply: "We have tried other approaches, but they do
not work." Respondents emphasize the history in Massachusetts of obstruction
at abortion clinics, and the Commonwealth's allegedly failed attempts to combat
such obstruction with injunctions and individual prosecutions. They also point
to the Commonwealth's experience under the 2000 version of the Act, during
which the police found it difficult to enforce the six-foot no-approach zones
given the "frenetic" activity in front of clinic entrances. According to
respondents, this history shows that Massachusetts has tried less restrictive
alternatives to the buffer zones, to no avail.
We cannot accept that contention. Although respondents claim that
Massachusetts "tried other laws already on the books," they identify not a single
prosecution brought under those laws within at least the last 17 years. And
while they also claim that the Commonwealth "tried injunctions," , the last
injunctions they cite date to the 1990s. In short, the Commonwealth has not
shown that it seriously undertook to address the problem with less intrusive
tools readily available to it. Nor has it shown that it considered different
methods that other jurisdictions have found effective.
Respondents contend that the alternatives we have discussed suffer from two
defects: First, given the "widespread" nature of the problem, it is simply not
"practicable" to rely on individual prosecutions and injunctions. But far from
being "widespread," the problem appears from the record to be limited
principally to the Boston clinic on Saturday mornings. Moreover, by their own
account, the police appear perfectly capable of singling out lawbreakers. The
legislative testimony preceding the 2007 Act revealed substantial police and
video monitoring at the clinics, especially when large gatherings were
anticipated. Captain Evans testified that his officers are so familiar with the
scene outside the Boston clinic that they "know all the players down there." And
Attorney General Coakley relied on video surveillance to show legislators
conduct she thought was "clearly against the law." If Commonwealth officials
can compile an extensive record of obstruction and harassment to support their
preferred legislation, we do not see why they cannot do the same to support
injunctions and prosecutions against those who might deliberately flout the law.
The second supposed defect in the alternatives we have identified is that laws
like subsection (e) of the Act and the federal FACE Act require a showing of
intentional or deliberate obstruction, intimidation, or harassment, which is
often difficult to prove. As Captain Evans predicted in his legislative testimony,
fixed buffer zones would "make our job so much easier."
Of course they would. But that is not enough to satisfy the First Amendment.
To meet the requirement of narrow tailoring, the government must demonstrate
that alternative measures that burden substantially less speech would fail to
achieve the government's interests, not simply that the chosen route is easier. A
painted line on the sidewalk is easy to enforce, but the prime objective of the
First Amendment is not efficiency. In any case, we do not think that showing
intentional obstruction is nearly so difficult in this context as respondents
suggest. To determine whether a protestor intends to block access to a clinic, a
police officer need only order him to move. If he refuses, then there is no
question that his continued conduct is knowing or intentional.

Robson

515

The First Amendment

For similar reasons, respondents' reliance on our decision in Burson v. Freeman
(1992) is misplaced. There, we upheld a state statute that established 100-foot
buffer zones outside polling places on election day within which no one could
display or distribute campaign materials or solicit votes. We approved the buffer
zones as a valid prophylactic measure, noting that existing "[i]ntimidation and
interference laws fall short of serving a State's compelling interests because
they 'deal with only the most blatant and specific attempts' to impede
elections." Such laws were insufficient because "[v]oter intimidation and election
fraud are . . . difficult to detect." Burson. Obstruction of abortion clinics and
harassment of patients, by contrast, are anything but subtle.
We also noted in Burson that under state law, "law enforcement officers
generally are barred from the vicinity of the polls to avoid any appearance of
coercion in the electoral process," with the result that "many acts of interference
would go undetected." Not so here. Again, the police maintain a significant
presence outside Massachusetts abortion clinics. The buffer zones in Burson
were justified because less restrictive measures were inadequate. Respondents
have not shown that to be the case here.
Given the vital First Amendment interests at stake, it is not enough for
Massachusetts simply to say that other approaches have not worked.
Petitioners wish to converse with their fellow citizens about an important
subject on the public streets and sidewalks--sites that have hosted discussions
about the issues of the day throughout history. Respondents assert undeniably
significant interests in maintaining public safety on those same streets and
sidewalks, as well as in preserving access to adjacent healthcare facilities. But
here the Commonwealth has pursued those interests by the extreme step of
closing a substantial portion of a traditional public forum to all speakers. It has
done so without seriously addressing the problem through alternatives that
leave the forum open for its time-honored purposes. The Commonwealth may
not do that consistent with the First Amendment.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SCALIA, WITH WHOM JUSTICE KENNEDY AND JUSTICE THOMAS JOIN,
CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
Today's opinion carries forward this Court's practice of giving abortion-rights
advocates a pass when it comes to suppressing the free-speech rights of their
opponents. There is an entirely separate, abridged edition of the First
Amendment applicable to speech against abortion. See, e.g., Hill v. Colorado
(2000); Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc. (1994).
The second half of the Court's analysis today, invalidating the law at issue
because of inadequate "tailoring," is certainly attractive to those of us who
oppose an abortion-speech edition of the First Amendment. But think again.
This is an opinion that has Something for Everyone, and the more significant

Robson

516

The First Amendment

portion continues the onward march of abortion-speech-only jurisprudence.
That is the first half of the Court's analysis, which concludes that a statute of
this sort is not content based and hence not subject to so-called strict scrutiny.
The Court reaches out to decide that question unnecessarily--or at least
unnecessarily insofar as legal analysis is concerned.
I disagree with the Court's dicta (Part III) and hence see no reason to opine on
its holding (Part IV).
I. The Court's Content-Neutrality Discussion Is Unnecessary
The gratuitous portion of today's opinion is Part III, which concludes--in seven
pages of the purest dicta--that subsection (b) of the Massachusetts
Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act is not specifically directed at speech
opposing (or even concerning) abortion and hence need not meet the strictscrutiny standard applicable to content-based speech regulations. Inasmuch as
Part IV holds that the Act is unconstitutional because it does not survive the
lesser level of scrutiny associated with content-neutral "time, place, and
manner" regulations, there is no principled reason for the majority to decide
whether the statute is subject to strict scrutiny. ***
II. The Statute Is Content Based and Fails Strict Scrutiny
Having eagerly volunteered to take on the level-of-scrutiny question, the Court
provides the wrong answer. Petitioners argue for two reasons that subsection
(b) articulates a content-based speech restriction--and that we must therefore
evaluate it through the lens of strict scrutiny.
A. Application to Abortion Clinics Only
*** It blinks reality to say, as the majority does, that a blanket prohibition on
the use of streets and sidewalks where speech on only one politically
controversial topic is likely to occur--and where that speech can most effectively
be communicated--is not content based. Would the Court exempt from strict
scrutiny a law banning access to the streets and sidewalks surrounding the site
of the Republican National Convention? Or those used annually to
commemorate the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights marches? Or those
outside the Internal Revenue Service? Surely not.
*** Every objective indication shows that the provision's primary purpose is to
restrict speech that opposes abortion.
I begin, as suggested above, with the fact that the Act burdens only the public
spaces outside abortion clinics. One might have expected the majority to defend
the statute's peculiar targeting by arguing that those locations regularly face
the safety and access problems that it says the Act was designed to solve. But
the majority does not make that argument because it would be untrue. As the
Court belatedly discovers in Part IV of its opinion, although the statute applies
to all abortion clinics in Massachusetts, only one is known to have been beset
by the problems that the statute supposedly addresses. The Court uses this
striking fact (a smoking gun, so to speak) as a basis for concluding that the law
is insufficiently "tailored" to safety and access concerns (Part IV) rather than as
a basis for concluding that it is not directed to those concerns at all, but to the

Robson

517

The First Amendment

suppression of antiabortion speech. That is rather like invoking the eight
missed human targets of a shooter who has killed one victim to prove, not that
he is guilty of attempted mass murder, but that he has bad aim.
*** The structure of the Act also indicates that it rests on content-based
concerns. The goals of "public safety, patient access to healthcare, and the
unobstructed use of public sidewalks and roadways," are already achieved by
an earlier-enacted subsection of the statute, which provides criminal penalties
for "[a]ny person who knowingly obstructs, detains, hinders, impedes or blocks
another person's entry to or exit from a reproductive health care facility."
§120E½(e). As the majority recognizes, that provision is easy to enforce. Thus,
the speech-free zones carved out by subsection (b) add nothing to safety and
access; what they achieve, and what they were obviously designed to achieve, is
the suppression of speech opposing abortion.
Further contradicting the Court's fanciful defense of the Act is the fact that
subsection (b) was enacted as a more easily enforceable substitute for a prior
provision. That provision did not exclude people entirely from the restricted
areas around abortion clinics; rather, it forbade people in those areas to
approach within six feet of another person without that person's consent "for the
purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in
oral protest, education or counseling with such other person." §120E½(b) (West
2000). As the majority acknowledges, that provision was "modeled on a . . .
Colorado law that this Court had upheld in Hill." And in that case, the Court
recognized that the statute in question was directed at the suppression of
unwelcome speech, vindicating what Hill called "[t]he unwilling listener's
interest in avoiding unwanted communication." The Court held that interest to
be content neutral.
The provision at issue here was indisputably meant to serve the same interest
in protecting citizens' supposed right to avoid speech that they would rather not
hear. For that reason, we granted a second question for review in this case
(though one would not know that from the Court's opinion, which fails to
mention it): whether Hill should be cut back or cast aside. See Pet. for Cert. i.
(stating second question presented as "If Hill . . . permits enforcement of this
law, whether Hill should be limited or overruled"); 570 U. S. ___ (2013) (granting
certiorari without reservation). The majority avoids that question by declaring
the Act content neutral on other (entirely unpersuasive) grounds. In concluding
that the statute is content based and therefore subject to strict scrutiny, I
necessarily conclude that Hill should be overruled. Reasons for doing so are set
forth in the dissents in that case, (Scalia, J.); (Kennedy, J.), and in the
abundance of scathing academic commentary describing how Hill stands in
contradiction to our First Amendment jurisprudence. Protecting people from
speech they do not want to hear is not a function that the First Amendment
allows the government to undertake in the public streets and sidewalks.
One final thought regarding Hill: It can be argued, and it should be argued in
the next case, that by stating that "the Act would not be content neutral if it
were concerned with undesirable effects that arise from . . . '[l]isteners'
reactions to speech,' " and then holding the Act unconstitutional for being
insufficiently tailored to safety and access concerns, the Court itself has sub
silentio (and perhaps inadvertently) overruled Hill. The unavoidable implication

Robson

518

The First Amendment

of that holding is that protection against unwelcome speech cannot justify
restrictions on the use of public streets and sidewalks.
B. Exemption for Abortion-Clinic Employees or Agents
Petitioners contend that the Act targets speech opposing abortion (and thus
constitutes a presumptively invalid viewpoint-discriminatory restriction) for
another reason as well: It exempts "employees or agents" of an abortion clinic
"acting within the scope of their employment," §120E½(b)(2).
It goes without saying that "[g]ranting waivers to favored speakers (or . . .
denying them to disfavored speakers) would of course be unconstitutional."
Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist. (2002). The majority opinion sets forth a two-part
inquiry for assessing whether a regulation is content based, but when it comes
to assessing the exemption for abortion-clinic employees or agents, the Court
forgets its own teaching. Its opinion jumps right over the prong that asks
whether the provision "draw[s] . . . distinctions on its face," and instead
proceeds directly to the purpose-related prong, see , asking whether the
exemption "represent[s] a governmental attempt to give one side of a debatable
public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people." I disagree
with the majority's negative answer to that question, but that is beside the
point if the text of the statute--whatever its purposes might have been-"license[s] one side of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to
follow Marquis of Queensberry rules." R. A. V. v. St. Paul (1992) [Chapter 3].
Is there any serious doubt that abortion-clinic employees or agents "acting within
the scope of their employment" near clinic entrances may--indeed, often will-speak in favor of abortion ("You are doing the right thing")? Or speak in
opposition to the message of abortion opponents--saying, for example, that "this
is a safe facility" to rebut the statement that it is not? The Court's contrary
assumption is simply incredible. And the majority makes no attempt to
establish the further necessary proposition that abortion-clinic employees and
agents do not engage in nonspeech activities directed to the suppression of
antiabortion speech by hampering the efforts of counselors to speak to
prospective clients. Are we to believe that a clinic employee sent out to "escort"
prospective clients into the building would not seek to prevent a counselor like
Eleanor McCullen from communicating with them? He could pull a woman
away from an approaching counselor, cover her ears, or make loud noises to
drown out the counselor's pleas.
The Court points out that the exemption may allow into the speech-free zones
clinic employees other than escorts, such as "the maintenance worker shoveling
a snowy sidewalk or the security guard patrolling a clinic entrance." I doubt
that Massachusetts legislators had those people in mind, but whether they did
is in any event irrelevant. Whatever other activity is permitted, so long as the
statute permits speech favorable to abortion rights while excluding antiabortion
speech, it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint.
***

Robson

519

The First Amendment

C. Conclusion
In sum, the Act should be reviewed under the strict-scrutiny standard
applicable to content-based legislation. That standard requires that a regulation
represent "the least restrictive means" of furthering "a compelling Government
interest." Respondents do not even attempt to argue that subsection (b) survives
this test. ***
III. Narrow Tailoring
Having determined that the Act is content based and does not withstand strict
scrutiny, I need not pursue the inquiry conducted in Part IV of the Court's
opinion--whether the statute is " 'narrowly tailored to serve a significant
governmental interest.' " I suppose I could do so, taking as a given the Court's
erroneous content-neutrality conclusion in Part III; and if I did, I suspect I
would agree with the majority that the legislation is not narrowly tailored to
advance the interests asserted by respondents. But I prefer not to take part in
the assembling of an apparent but specious unanimity. I leave both the plainly
unnecessary and erroneous half and the arguably correct half of the Court's
analysis to the majority.
The obvious purpose of the challenged portion of the Massachusetts
Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act is to "protect" prospective clients of
abortion clinics from having to hear abortion-opposing speech on public streets
and sidewalks. The provision is thus unconstitutional root and branch and
cannot be saved, as the majority suggests, by limiting its application to the
single facility that has experienced the safety and access problems to which it is
quite obviously not addressed. I concur only in the judgment that the statute is
unconstitutional under the First Amendment.
JUSTICE ALITO, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
I agree that the Massachusetts statute at issue in this case, Mass. Gen. Laws,
ch. 266, §120E½(b) (West 2012), violates the First Amendment. As the Court
recognizes, if the Massachusetts law discriminates on the basis of viewpoint, it
is unconstitutional, and I believe the law clearly discriminates on this ground.
*** In this case, I do not think that it is possible to reach a judgment about the
intent of the Massachusetts Legislature without taking into account the fact
that the law that the legislature enacted blatantly discriminates based on
viewpoint. In light of this feature, as well as the overbreadth that the Court
identifies, it cannot be said, based on the present record, that the law would be
content neutral even if the exemption for clinic employees and agents were
excised. However, if the law were truly content neutral, I would agree with the
Court that the law would still be unconstitutional on the ground that it burdens
more speech than is necessary to serve the Commonwealth's asserted interests.

Is the similarity of the “time, place, or manner” standard of review

Would you suggest a higher standard for one or the other?

The government practice of establishing “designated protest areas”

An ordinance bans all registered sex offenders from entering a

667 F.3d 1111 (10th Cir. 2012).
4.
McCullen v. Coakley is an unanimous but highly contentious
decision in large part because of the disagreement over whether the
Massachusetts statute should be analyzed as a content (or even
viewpoint) regulation or a “time, place, or manner” regulation. How do
you think the concurring Justices would view the statutes directed at
funeral protests as described in the next note.

Note:	  Funeral	  Protests	  
In Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443 (2011), the Court considered a jury
verdict against Fred Phelps, certain members of his family, and his
organization, the Westboro Baptist Church, for intentional infliction of
emotional distress on behalf of Albert Snyder, the father of Marine Lance
Corporal Matthew Snyder. The Westboro Baptist Church has become
well known for its picketing of various funerals, including those of
soldiers. On the day of the memorial service for Snyder, the Westboro
congregation members picketed on public land adjacent to public streets
near the Maryland State House, the United States Naval Academy, and
Matthew Snyder's funeral. The Westboro picketers carried signs that
were largely the same at all three locations. They stated, for instance:
“God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11,” “America is Doomed,” “Don't
Pray for the USA,” “Thank God for IEDs,” “Thank God for Dead Soldiers,”
“Pope in Hell,” “Priests Rape Boys,” “God Hates Fags,” “You're Going to
Hell,” and “God Hates You.”
In an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court found that the
picketing was protected by the First Amendment and a damages awarded
precluded. The Court stated
Westboro conducted its picketing peacefully on matters of public concern at a
public place adjacent to a public street. Such space occupies a “special position
in terms of First Amendment protection.” “[W]e have repeatedly referred to
public streets as the archetype of a traditional public forum,” noting that

“ ‘[t]ime out of mind’ public streets and sidewalks have been used for public
assembly and debate.”

However, the Court noted:
Westboro's choice of where and when to conduct its picketing is not beyond the
Government's regulatory reach—it is “subject to reasonable time, place, or
manner restrictions” that are consistent with the standards announced in this
Court's precedents. Maryland now has a law imposing restrictions on funeral
picketing, Md.Crim. Law Code Ann. § 10–205 (Lexis Supp.2010), as do 43 other
States and the Federal Government. See Brief for American Legion as Amicus
Curiae 18–19, n. 2 (listing statutes). To the extent these laws are content neutral,
they raise very different questions from the tort verdict at issue in this case.
Maryland's law, however, was not in effect at the time of the events at issue here,
so we have no occasion to consider how it might apply to facts such as those
before us, or whether it or other similar regulations are constitutional.

But are such statutes “content neutral”? Consider this typical ordinance,
from Manchester, Missouri.
Manchester Code § 210.264 provides:
Funeral Protests Prohibited, When—Citation of Law—Definition
A. Every citizen may freely speak, write and publish the person's sentiments on
all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of the right, but no person shall
picket or engage in other protest activities, nor shall any association or
corporation cause picketing or other protest activities to occur within three
hundred (300) feet of any residence, cemetery, funeral home, church, synagogue,
or other establishment during or within one (1) hour before or one (1) hour after
the conducting of any actual funeral or burial service at that place.
B. As used in this Section, “other protest activities ” means any action that is
disruptive or undertaken to disrupt or disturb a funeral or burial service.
C. As used in this Section, “funeral ” and “burial service ” mean the ceremonies
and memorial services held in conjunction with the burial or cremation of the
dead, but this Section does not apply to processions while they are in transit
beyond any three hundred (300) foot zone that is established under Subsection
(A) above.

The Eighth Circuit in Phelps-Roper v. City of Manchester, Mo., 697 F.3d
678, 695 (8th Cir. 2012), relying in large part on Hill v. Colorado
(discussed in McCullen v. Coakley), upheld the Manchester ordinance,
finding that:
Manchester's ordinance is content neutral. A person may be regulated under the
ordinance for disrupting or attempting to disrupt a funeral or burial service with
speech concerning any topic or viewpoint. The ordinance makes “no reference to
the content of the speech” and is only a “regulation of the places where some
speech may occur.” [citing Hill v. Colorado]. It simply limits when and where
picketing and other protest activities may occur in relation to a funeral or burial
service without regard for the speaker's viewpoint.

Applying the standard of review for time, place, or manner restrictions,
the court concluded
that the Phelps–Ropers have not shown in their facial challenge to Manchester's
amended ordinance that the city has imposed unconstitutional limits on the

Robson

522

The First Amendment

time, place, and manner of their picketing. Manchester only limits picketing and
other protest activities within 300 feet of a funeral or burial service while it is
occurring and for one hour before and after, and it survives First Amendment
scrutiny because it serves a significant government interest, it is narrowly
tailored, and it leaves open ample alternative channels for communication.

STEVENS, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH BURGER, C. J., AND WHITE,
POWELL, REHNQUIST, AND O'CONNOR, JJ., JOINED. BRENNAN, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION,
IN WHICH MARSHALL AND BLACKMUN, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE STEVENS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Section 28.04 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code prohibits the posting of signs
on public property. The question presented is whether that prohibition abridges
appellees' freedom of speech within the meaning of the First Amendment.
In March 1979, Roland Vincent was a candidate for election to the Los Angeles
City Council. A group of his supporters known as Taxpayers for Vincent
(Taxpayers) entered into a contract with a political sign service company known
as Candidates' Outdoor Graphics Service (COGS) to fabricate and post signs
with Vincent's name on them. COGS produced 15- by 44-inch cardboard signs
and attached them to utility poles at various locations by draping them over
crosswires which support the poles and stapling the cardboard together at the
bottom. The signs' message was: "Roland Vincent - City Council."
Acting under the authority of 28.04 of the Municipal Code, employees of the
city's Bureau of Street Maintenance routinely removed all posters attached to
utility poles and similar objects covered by the ordinance, including the COGS
signs. The weekly sign removal report covering the period March 1-March 7,
1979, indicated that among the 1,207 signs removed from public property
during that week, 48 were identified as "Roland Vincent" signs. Most of the
other signs identified in that report were apparently commercial in character.
On March 12, 1979, Taxpayers and COGS filed this action in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California, naming the city, the Director
of the Bureau of Street Maintenance, and members of the City Council as
defendants. They sought an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance as
well as compensatory and punitive damages. After engaging in discovery, the
parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of liability. The
District Court entered findings of fact, concluded that the ordinance was
constitutional, and granted the City's motion.

Robson

523

The First Amendment

The District Court's findings do not purport to resolve any disputed issue of
fact; instead, they summarize material in the record that appears to be
uncontroverted. The findings recite that the principal responsibility for locating
and removing signs and handbills posted in violation of 28.04 is assigned to the
Street Use Inspection Division of the city's Bureau of Street Maintenance. The
court found that both political and nonpolitical signs are illegally posted and
that they are removed "without regard to their content."
After explaining the purposes for which the City's zoning code had been enacted,
and noting that the prohibition in 28.04 furthered those purposes, the District
Court found that the large number of illegally posted signs "constitute a clutter
and visual blight." With specific reference to the posting of the COGS signs on
utility pole crosswires, the District Court found that such posting "would add
somewhat to the blight and inevitably would encourage greatly increased
posting in other unauthorized and unsightly places . . . ."
In addition, the District Court found that placing signs on utility poles creates a
potential safety hazard, and that other violations of 28.04 "block views and
otherwise cause traffic hazards." Finally, the District Court concluded that the
sign prohibition does not prevent taxpayers or COGS "from exercising their free
speech rights on the public streets and in other public places; they remain free
to picket and parade, to distribute handbills, to carry signs and to post their
signs and handbills on their automobiles and on private property with the
permission of the owners thereof."
In its conclusions of law the District Court characterized the esthetic and
economic interests in improving the beauty of the City "by eliminating clutter
and visual blight" as "legitimate and compelling." Those interests, together with
the interest in protecting the safety of workmen who must scale utility poles
and the interest in eliminating traffic hazards, adequately supported the sign
prohibition as a reasonable regulation affecting the time, place, and manner of
expression.
The Court of Appeals did not question any of the District Court's findings of fact,
but it rejected some of its conclusions of law. The Court of Appeals reasoned
that the ordinance was presumptively unconstitutional because significant First
Amendment interests were involved. It noted that the City had advanced three
separate justifications for the ordinance, but concluded that none of them was
sufficient. The Court of Appeals held that the City had failed to make a
sufficient showing that its asserted interests in esthetics and preventing visual
clutter were substantial because it had not offered to demonstrate that the City
was engaged in a comprehensive effort to remove other contributions to an
unattractive environment in commercial and industrial areas. The City's
interest in minimizing traffic hazards was rejected because it was readily
apparent that no substantial traffic problems would result from permitting the
posting of certain kinds of signs on many of the publicly owned objects covered
by the ordinance. Finally, while acknowledging that a flat prohibition against
signs on certain objects such as fire hydrants and traffic signals would be a
permissible method of preventing interference with the intended use of public
property, and that regulation of the size, design, and construction of posters, or
of the method of removing them, might be reasonable, the Court of Appeals
concluded that the City had not justified its total ban.

Robson

524

The First Amendment

In its appeal to this Court the City challenges the Court of Appeals' holding that
28.04 is unconstitutional on its face. Taxpayers and COGS defend that holding
and also contend that the ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to their
posting of political campaign signs on the crosswires of utility poles. There are
two quite different ways in which a statute or ordinance may be considered
invalid "on its face" - either because it is unconstitutional in every conceivable
application, or because it seeks to prohibit such a broad range of protected
conduct that it is unconstitutionally "overbroad." We shall analyze the "facial"
challenges to the ordinance, and then address its specific application to
appellees.
I
[The Court rejected a facial overbreadth argument]. In light of these arguments,
appellees' attack on the ordinance is basically a challenge to the ordinance as
applied to their activities. We therefore limit our analysis of the constitutionality
of the ordinance to the concrete case before us, and now turn to the arguments
that it is invalid as applied to the expressive activity of Taxpayers and COGS.
II
The ordinance prohibits appellees from communicating with the public in a
certain manner, and presumably diminishes the total quantity of their
communication in the City. The application of the ordinance to appellees'
expressive activities surely raises the question whether the ordinance abridges
their "freedom of speech" within the meaning of the First Amendment, and
appellees certainly have standing to challenge the application of the ordinance
to their own expressive activities. "But to say the ordinance presents a First
Amendment issue is not necessarily to say that it constitutes a First
Amendment violation." Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego (1981) (Burger, C. J.,
dissenting). It has been clear since this Court's earliest decisions concerning the
freedom of speech that the state may sometimes curtail speech when necessary
to advance a significant and legitimate state interest. Schenck v. United States
(1919)[Chapter 2].
*** [T]here are some purported interests - such as a desire to suppress support
for a minority party or an unpopular cause, or to exclude the expression of
certain points of view from the marketplace of ideas - that are so plainly
illegitimate that they would immediately invalidate the rule. The general
principle that has emerged from this line of cases is that the First Amendment
forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints
or ideas at the expense of others.
That general rule has no application to this case. For there is not even a hint of
bias or censorship in the City's enactment or enforcement of this ordinance.
There is no claim that the ordinance was designed to suppress certain ideas
that the City finds distasteful or that it has been applied to appellees because of
the views that they express. The text of the ordinance is neutral - indeed it is
silent - concerning any speaker's point of view, and the District Court's findings
indicate that it has been applied to appellees and others in an evenhanded
manner.

Robson

525

The First Amendment

In United States v. O'Brien (1968), the Court set forth the appropriate framework
for reviewing a viewpoint-neutral regulation of this kind: "[A] government
regulation is sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of the
Government; if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if
the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression;
and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no
greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest."
It is well settled that the state may legitimately exercise its police powers to
advance esthetic values. ***
In this case, taxpayers and COGS do not dispute that it is within the
constitutional power of the City to attempt to improve its appearance, or that
this interest is basically unrelated to the suppression of ideas. Therefore the
critical inquiries are whether that interest is sufficiently substantial to justify
the effect of the ordinance on appellees' expression, and whether that effect is
no greater than necessary to accomplish the City's purpose.
III
*** We reaffirm the conclusion of the majority in Metromedia [v. San Diego
(1981)]. The problem addressed by this ordinance - the visual assault on the
citizens of Los Angeles presented by an accumulation of signs posted on public
property - constitutes a significant substantive evil within the City's power to
prohibit. "[T]he city's interest in attempting to preserve [or improve] the quality
of urban life is one that must be accorded high respect." Young v. American Mini
Theatres, Inc. (1976) (plurality opinion).
IV
We turn to the question whether the scope of the restriction on appellees'
expressive activity is substantially broader than necessary to protect the City's
interest in eliminating visual clutter. The incidental restriction on expression
which results from the City's attempt to accomplish such a purpose is
considered justified as a reasonable regulation of the time, place, or manner of
expression if it is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The District Court
found that the signs prohibited by the ordinance do constitute visual clutter
and blight. By banning these signs, the City did no more than eliminate the
exact source of the evil it sought to remedy. The plurality wrote in Metromedia:
"It is not speculative to recognize that bill-boards by their very nature, wherever
located and however constructed, can be perceived as an `esthetic harm.'" The
same is true of posted signs.
It is true that the esthetic interest in preventing the kind of litter that may
result from the distribution of leaflets on the public streets and sidewalks
cannot support a prophylactic prohibition against the citizen's exercise of that
method of expressing his views. In Schneider v. State (1939), the Court held that
ordinances that absolutely prohibited handbilling on the streets were invalid.
The Court explained that cities could adequately protect the esthetic interest in
avoiding litter without abridging protected expression merely by penalizing
those who actually litter. Taxpayers contend that their interest in supporting
Vincent's political campaign, which affords them a constitutional right to

Robson

526

The First Amendment

distribute brochures and leaflets on the public streets of Los Angeles, provides
equal support for their asserted right to post temporary signs on objects
adjacent to the streets and sidewalks. They argue that the mere fact that their
temporary signs "add somewhat" to the city's visual clutter is entitled to no
more weight than the temporary unsightliness of discarded handbills and the
additional street-cleaning burden that were insufficient to justify the ordinances
reviewed in Schneider.
The rationale of Schneider is inapposite in the context of the instant case. There,
individual citizens were actively exercising their right to communicate directly
with potential recipients of their message. The conduct continued only while the
speakers or distributors remained on the scene. In this case, appellees posted
dozens of temporary signs throughout an area where they would remain
unattended until removed. As the Court expressly noted in Schneider, the First
Amendment does not "deprive a municipality of power to enact regulations
against throwing literature broadcast in the streets. Prohibition of such conduct
would not abridge the constitutional liberty since such activity bears no
necessary relationship to the freedom to speak, write, print or distribute
information or opinion." In short, there is no constitutional impediment to "the
punishment of those who actually throw papers on the streets." A distributor of
leaflets has no right simply to scatter his pamphlets in the air - or to toss large
quantities of paper from the window of a tall building or a low flying airplane.
Characterizing such an activity as a separate means of communication does not
diminish the State's power to condemn it as a public nuisance. The right
recognized in Schneider is to tender the written material to the passerby who
may reject it or accept it, and who thereafter may keep it, dispose of it properly,
or incur the risk of punishment if he lets it fall to the ground. One who is
rightfully on a street open to the public "carries with him there as elsewhere the
constitutional right to express his views in an orderly fashion. This right
extends to the communication of ideas by handbills and literature as well as by
the spoken word."
With respect to signs posted by appellees, however, it is the tangible medium of
expressing the message that has the adverse impact on the appearance of the
landscape. In Schneider, an antilittering statute could have addressed the
substantive evil without prohibiting expressive activity, whereas application of
the prophylactic rule actually employed gratuitously infringed upon the right of
an individual to communicate directly with a willing listener. Here, the
substantive evil - visual blight - is not merely a possible byproduct of the
activity, but is created by the medium of expression itself. In contrast to
Schneider, therefore, the application of the ordinance in this case responds
precisely to the substantive problem which legitimately concerns the City. The
ordinance curtails no more speech than is necessary to accomplish its purpose.
V
The Court of Appeals accepted the argument that a prohibition against the use
of unattractive signs cannot be justified on esthetic grounds if it fails to apply to
all equally unattractive signs wherever they might be located. A comparable
argument was categorically rejected in Metromedia. In that case it was argued
that the city could not simultaneously permit billboards to be used for onsite
advertising and also justify the prohibition against offsite advertising on

Robson

527

The First Amendment

esthetic grounds, since both types of advertising were equally unattractive. The
Court held, however, that the city could reasonably conclude that the esthetic
interest was outweighed by the countervailing interest in one kind of advertising
even though it was not outweighed by the other. So here, the validity of the
esthetic interest in the elimination of signs on public property is not
compromised by failing to extend the ban to private property. The private
citizen's interest in controlling the use of his own property justifies the
disparate treatment. Moreover, by not extending the ban to all locations, a
significant opportunity to communicate by means of temporary signs is
preserved, and private property owners' esthetic concerns will keep the posting
of signs on their property within reasonable bounds. Even if some visual blight
remains, a partial, content-neutral ban may nevertheless enhance the City's
appearance.
Furthermore, there is no finding that in any area where appellees seek to place
signs, there are already so many signs posted on adjacent private property that
the elimination of appellees' signs would have an inconsequential effect on the
esthetic values with which the City is concerned. There is simply no predicate
in the findings of the District Court for the conclusion that the prohibition
against the posting of appellees' signs fails to advance the City's esthetic
interest.
VI
While the First Amendment does not guarantee the right to employ every
conceivable method of communication at all times and in all places, a
restriction on expressive activity may be invalid if the remaining modes of
communication are inadequate. The Los Angeles ordinance does not affect any
individual's freedom to exercise the right to speak and to distribute literature in
the same place where the posting of signs on public property is prohibited. To
the extent that the posting of signs on public property has advantages over
these forms of expression, there is no reason to believe that these same
advantages cannot be obtained through other means. To the contrary, the
findings of the District Court indicate that there are ample alternative modes of
communication in Los Angeles. Notwithstanding appellees' general assertions in
their brief concerning the utility of political posters, nothing in the findings
indicates that the posting of political posters on public property is a uniquely
valuable or important mode of communication, or that appellees' ability to
communicate effectively is threatened by ever-increasing restrictions on
expression.
VII
Appellees suggest that the public property covered by the ordinance either is
itself a "public forum" for First Amendment purposes, or at least should be
treated in the same respect as the "public forum" in which the property is
located. "Traditional public forum property occupies a special position in terms
of First Amendment protection," and appellees maintain that their sign-posting
activities are entitled to this protection.
In Hague v. CIO (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.), it was recognized: "Wherever the
title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust
for the use of the public, and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of

Robson

528

The First Amendment

assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public
questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times,
been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens. The
privilege of a citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for
communication of views on national questions may be regulated in the interest
of all; it is not absolute, but relative, and must be exercised in subordination to
the general comfort and convenience, and in consonance with peace and good
order; but it must not, in the guise of regulation, be abridged or denied."
Appellees' reliance on the public forum doctrine is misplaced. They fail to
demonstrate the existence of a traditional right of access respecting such items
as utility poles for purposes of their communication comparable to that
recognized for public streets and parks, and it is clear that "the First
Amendment does not guarantee access to government property simply because
it is owned or controlled by the government." Rather, the "existence of a right of
access to public property and the standard by which limitations upon such a
right must be evaluated differ depending on the character of the property at
issue." Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn. (1983).
Lampposts can of course be used as signposts, but the mere fact that
government property can be used as a vehicle for communication does not
mean that the Constitution requires such uses to be permitted. Public property
which is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication may
be reserved by the State "for its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise,
as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress
expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker's view." Perry
Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn. Given our analysis of the
legitimate interest served by the ordinance, its viewpoint neutrality, and the
availability of alternative channels of communication, the ordinance is certainly
constitutional as applied to appellees under this standard.
VIII
Finally, Taxpayers and COGS argue that Los Angeles could have written an
ordinance that would have had a less severe effect on expressive activity such
as theirs, by permitting the posting of any kind of sign at any time on some
types of public property, or by making a variety of other more specific
exceptions to the ordinance: for signs carrying certain types of messages (such
as political campaign signs), for signs posted during specific time periods
(perhaps during political campaigns), for particular locations (perhaps for areas
already cluttered by an excessive number of signs on adjacent private property),
or for signs meeting design specifications (such as size or color). Plausible
public policy arguments might well be made in support of any such exception,
but it by no means follows that it is therefore constitutionally mandated, nor is
it clear that some of the suggested exceptions would even be constitutionally
permissible. For example, even though political speech is entitled to the fullest
possible measure of constitutional protection, there are a host of other
communications that command the same respect. An assertion that "Jesus
Saves," that "Abortion is Murder," that every woman has the "Right to Choose,"
or that "Alcohol Kills," may have a claim to a constitutional exemption from the
ordinance that is just as strong as "Roland Vincent - City Council." To create
an exception for appellees' political speech and not these other types of speech

Robson

529

The First Amendment

might create a risk of engaging in constitutionally forbidden content
discrimination. Moreover, the volume of permissible postings under such a
mandated exemption might so limit the ordinance's effect as to defeat its aim of
combating visual blight.
Any constitutionally mandated exception to the City's total prohibition against
temporary signs on public property would necessarily rest on a judicial
determination that the City's traffic control and safety interests had little or no
applicability within the excepted category, and that the City's interests in
esthetics are not sufficiently important to justify the prohibition in that category.
But the findings of the District Court provide no basis for questioning the
substantiality of the esthetic interest at stake, or for believing that a uniquely
important form of communication has been abridged for the categories of
expression engaged in by Taxpayers and COGS. Therefore, we accept the City's
position that it may decide that the esthetic interest in avoiding "visual clutter"
justifies a removal of signs creating or increasing that clutter. The findings of
the District Court that COGS signs add to the problems addressed by the
ordinance and, if permitted to remain, would encourage others to post
additional signs, are sufficient to justify application of the ordinance to these
appellees.
As recognized in Metromedia, if the city has a sufficient basis for believing that
billboards are traffic hazards and are unattractive, "then obviously the most
direct and perhaps the only effective approach to solving the problems they
create is to prohibit them." As is true of billboards, the esthetic interests that
are implicated by temporary signs are presumptively at work in all parts of the
city, including those where appellees posted their signs, and there is no basis in
the record in this case upon which to rebut that presumption. These interests
are both psychological and economic. The character of the environment affects
the quality of life and the value of property in both residential and commercial
areas. We hold that on this record these interests are sufficiently substantial to
justify this content-neutral, impartially administered prohibition against the
posting of appellees' temporary signs on public property and that such an
application of the ordinance does not create an unacceptable threat to the
"profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues
should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open." New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
(1964).
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to
that Court.
It is so ordered.

WHICH KENNEDY AND SOTOMAYOR, JJ., JOINED. BREYER, J., FILED AN OPINION CONCURRING IN
THE JUDGMENT. KAGAN, J., FILED AN OPINION CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT, IN WHICH
GINSBURG AND BREYER, JJ., JOINED

JUSTICE THOMAS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The town of Gilbert, Arizona (or Town), has adopted a comprehensive code
governing the manner in which people may display outdoor signs. Gilbert, Ariz.,
Land Development Code (Sign Code or Code), ch. 1, §4.402 (2005).1 The Sign
Code identifies various categories of signs based on the type of information they
convey, then subjects each category to different restrictions. One of the
categories is "Temporary Directional Signs Relating to a Qualifying Event,"
loosely defined as signs directing the public to a meeting of a nonprofit group.
§4.402(P). The Code imposes more stringent restrictions on these signs than it
does on signs conveying other messages. We hold that these provisions are
content-based regulations of speech that cannot survive strict scrutiny.
I
A
The Sign Code prohibits the display of outdoor signs anywhere within the Town
without a permit, but it then exempts 23 categories of signs from that
requirement. These exemptions include everything from bazaar signs to flying
banners. Three categories of exempt signs are particularly relevant here.
The first is "Ideological Sign[s]." This category includes any "sign
communicating a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes that is not a
Construction Sign, Directional Sign, Temporary Directional Sign Relating to a
Qualifying Event, Political Sign, Garage Sale Sign, or a sign owned or required
by a governmental agency." Of the three categories discussed here, the Code
treats ideological signs most favorably, allowing them to be up to 20 square feet
in area and to be placed in all "zoning districts" without time limits.
The second category is "Political Sign[s]." This includes any "temporary sign
designed to influence the outcome of an election called by a public body." The
Code treats these signs less favorably than ideological signs. The Code allows
the placement of political signs up to 16 square feet on residential property and
up to 32 square feet on nonresidential property, undeveloped municipal
property, and "rights-of-way." These signs may be displayed up to 60 days
before a primary election and up to 15 days following a general election.
The third category is "Temporary Directional Signs Relating to a Qualifying
Event." This includes any "Temporary Sign intended to direct pedestrians,
motorists, and other passersby to a 'qualifying event.' " A "qualifying event" is
defined as any "assembly, gathering, activity, or meeting sponsored, arranged,
or promoted by a religious, charitable, community service, educational, or other
similar non-profit organization." Ibid. The Code treats temporary directional

Robson

531

The First Amendment

signs even less favorably than political signs. Temporary directional signs may
be no larger than six square feet. They may be placed on private property or on
a public right-of-way, but no more than four signs may be placed on a single
property at any time. And, they may be displayed no more than 12 hours before
the "qualifying event" and no more than 1 hour afterward.
B
Petitioners Good News Community Church (Church) and its pastor, Clyde Reed,
wish to advertise the time and location of their Sunday church services. The
Church is a small, cash-strapped entity that owns no building, so it holds its
services at elementary schools or other locations in or near the Town. In order
to inform the public about its services, which are held in a variety of different
locations, the Church began placing 15 to 20 temporary signs around the Town,
frequently in the public right-of-way abutting the street. The signs typically
displayed the Church's name, along with the time and location of the upcoming
service. Church members would post the signs early in the day on Saturday
and then remove them around midday on Sunday. The display of these signs
requires little money and manpower, and thus has proved to be an economical
and effective way for the Church to let the community know where its services
are being held each week.
This practice caught the attention of the Town's Sign Code compliance
manager, who twice cited the Church for violating the Code. The first citation
noted that the Church exceeded the time limits for displaying its temporary
directional signs. The second citation referred to the same problem, along with
the Church's failure to include the date of the event on the signs. Town officials
even confiscated one of the Church's signs, which Reed had to retrieve from the
municipal offices.
Reed contacted the Sign Code Compliance Department in an attempt to reach
an accommodation. His efforts proved unsuccessful. The Town's Code
compliance manager informed the Church that there would be "no leniency
under the Code" and promised to punish any future violations.
Shortly thereafter, petitioners filed a complaint in the United States District
Court for the District of Arizona, arguing that the Sign Code abridged their
freedom of speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The
District Court denied the petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction. The
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Sign Code's
provision regulating temporary directional signs did not regulate speech on the
basis of content. It reasoned that, even though an enforcement officer would
have to read the sign to determine what provisions of the Sign Code applied to
it, the " 'kind of cursory examination' " that would be necessary for an officer to
classify it as a temporary directional sign was "not akin to an officer
synthesizing the expressive content of the sign." It then remanded for the
District Court to determine in the first instance whether the Sign Code's
distinctions among temporary directional signs, political signs, and ideological
signs nevertheless constituted a content-based regulation of speech.
On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Town.
The Court of Appeals again affirmed, holding that the Code's sign categories
were content neutral. The court concluded that "the distinctions between

Robson

532

The First Amendment

Temporary Directional Signs, Ideological Signs, and Political Signs . . . are
based on objective factors relevant to Gilbert's creation of the specific exemption
from the permit requirement and do not otherwise consider the substance of
the sign." Relying on this Court's decision in Hill v. Colorado (2000), the Court of
Appeals concluded that the Sign Code is content neutral. As the court
explained, "Gilbert did not adopt its regulation of speech because it disagreed
with the message conveyed" and its "interests in regulat[ing] temporary signs
are unrelated to the content of the sign." Accordingly, the court believed that
the Code was "content-neutral as that term [has been] defined by the Supreme
Court." Id., at 1071. In light of that determination, it applied a lower level of
scrutiny to the Sign Code and concluded that the law did not violate the First
Amendment.
We granted certiorari, and now reverse.
II
A
The First Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth
Amendment, prohibits the enactment of laws "abridging the freedom of speech."
U. S. Const., Amdt. 1. Under that Clause, a government, including a municipal
government vested with state authority, "has no power to restrict expression
because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content." Police Dept.
of Chicago v. Mosley (1972). Content-based laws--those that target speech
based on its communicative content--are presumptively unconstitutional and
may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to
serve compelling state interests. R. A. V. v. St. Paul (1992); Simon & Schuster,
Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd. (1991).
Government regulation of speech is content based if a law applies to particular
speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed. E.g.,
Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc. (2011); Carey v. Brown (1980); Mosley. This
commonsense meaning of the phrase "content based" requires a court to
consider whether a regulation of speech "on its face" draws distinctions based
on the message a speaker conveys. Some facial distinctions based on a message
are obvious, defining regulated speech by particular subject matter, and others
are more subtle, defining regulated speech by its function or purpose. Both are
distinctions drawn based on the message a speaker conveys, and, therefore, are
subject to strict scrutiny.
Our precedents have also recognized a separate and additional category of laws
that, though facially content neutral, will be considered content-based
regulations of speech: laws that cannot be " 'justified without reference to the
content of the regulated speech,' " or that were adopted by the government
"because of disagreement with the message [the speech] conveys," Ward v. Rock
Against Racism (1989). Those laws, like those that are content based on their
face, must also satisfy strict scrutiny.
B
The Town's Sign Code is content based on its face. It defines "Temporary
Directional Signs" on the basis of whether a sign conveys the message of
directing the public to church or some other "qualifying event." It defines

Robson

533

The First Amendment

"Political Signs" on the basis of whether a sign's message is "designed to
influence the outcome of an election." And it defines "Ideological Signs" on the
basis of whether a sign "communicat[es] a message or ideas" that do not fit
within the Code's other categories. It then subjects each of these categories to
different restrictions.
The restrictions in the Sign Code that apply to any given sign thus depend
entirely on the communicative content of the sign. If a sign informs its reader of
the time and place a book club will discuss John Locke's Two Treatises of
Government, that sign will be treated differently from a sign expressing the view
that one should vote for one of Locke's followers in an upcoming election, and
both signs will be treated differently from a sign expressing an ideological view
rooted in Locke's theory of government. More to the point, the Church's signs
inviting people to attend its worship services are treated differently from signs
conveying other types of ideas. On its face, the Sign Code is a content-based
regulation of speech. We thus have no need to consider the government's
justifications or purposes for enacting the Code to determine whether it is
subject to strict scrutiny.
C
In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeals offered several
theories to explain why the Town's Sign Code should be deemed content
neutral. None is persuasive.
1
The Court of Appeals first determined that the Sign Code was content neutral
because the Town "did not adopt its regulation of speech [based on]
disagree[ment] with the message conveyed," and its justifications for regulating
temporary directional signs were "unrelated to the content of the sign." In its
brief to this Court, the United States similarly contends that a sign regulation is
content neutral--even if it expressly draws distinctions based on the sign's
communicative content--if those distinctions can be " 'justified without
reference to the content of the regulated speech.' "
But this analysis skips the crucial first step in the content-neutrality analysis:
determining whether the law is content neutral on its face. A law that is content
based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government's
benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of "animus toward the ideas
contained" in the regulated speech. Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc. (1993).
We have thus made clear that " '[i]llicit legislative intent is not the sine qua non
of a violation of the First Amendment,' " and a party opposing the government
"need adduce 'no evidence of an improper censorial motive.' " Simon & Schuster.
Although "a content-based purpose may be sufficient in certain circumstances
to show that a regulation is content based, it is not necessary." Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC (1994). In other words, an innocuous
justification cannot transform a facially content-based law into one that is
content neutral.
That is why we have repeatedly considered whether a law is content neutral on
its face before turning to the law's justification or purpose. See, e.g., Sorrell
(statute was content based "on its face," and there was also evidence of an

Robson

534

The First Amendment

impermissible legislative motive); Members of City Council of Los Angeles v.
Taxpayers for Vincent (1984) ("The text of the ordinance is neutral," and "there
is not even a hint of bias or censorship in the City's enactment or enforcement
of this ordinance"); Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, (1984)
(requiring that a facially content-neutral ban on camping must be "justified
without reference to the content of the regulated speech"); United States v.
O'Brien (1968) (noting that the statute "on its face deals with conduct having no
connection with speech," but examining whether the "the governmental interest
is unrelated to the suppression of free expression"). Because strict scrutiny
applies either when a law is content based on its face or when the purpose and
justification for the law are content based, a court must evaluate each question
before it concludes that the law is content neutral and thus subject to a lower
level of scrutiny.
The Court of Appeals and the United States misunderstand our decision in
Ward as suggesting that a government's purpose is relevant even when a law is
content based on its face. That is incorrect. *** Ward's framework "applies only
if a statute is content neutral." Hill (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Its rules thus operate
"to protect speech," not "to restrict it." Id.
The First Amendment requires no less. Innocent motives do not eliminate the
danger of censorship presented by a facially content-based statute, as future
government officials may one day wield such statutes to suppress disfavored
speech. That is why the First Amendment expressly targets the operation of the
laws--i.e., the "abridg[ement] of speech"--rather than merely the motives of
those who enacted them. U. S. Const., Amdt. 1. " 'The vice of content-based
legislation . . . is not that it is always used for invidious, thought-control
purposes, but that it lends itself to use for those purposes.' " Hill (SCALIA, J.,
dissenting).
*** [O]ne could easily imagine a Sign Code compliance manager who disliked
the Church's substantive teachings deploying the Sign Code to make it more
difficult for the Church to inform the public of the location of its services.
Accordingly, we have repeatedly "rejected the argument that 'discriminatory . . .
treatment is suspect under the First Amendment only when the legislature
intends to suppress certain ideas.' " Discovery Network. We do so again today.
2
The Court of Appeals next reasoned that the Sign Code was content neutral
because it "does not mention any idea or viewpoint, let alone single one out for
differential treatment." It reasoned that, for the purpose of the Code provisions,
"[i]t makes no difference which candidate is supported, who sponsors the event,
or what ideological perspective is asserted."
The Town seizes on this reasoning, insisting that "content based" is a term of
art that "should be applied flexibly" with the goal of protecting "viewpoints and
ideas from government censorship or favoritism." In the Town's view, a sign
regulation that "does not censor or favor particular viewpoints or ideas" cannot
be content based. The Sign Code allegedly passes this test because its
treatment of temporary directional signs does not raise any concerns that the
government is "endorsing or suppressing 'ideas or viewpoints,' " and the

Robson

535

The First Amendment

provisions for political signs and ideological signs "are neutral as to particular
ideas or viewpoints" within those categories.
This analysis conflates two distinct but related limitations that the First
Amendment places on government regulation of speech. Government
discrimination among viewpoints--or the regulation of speech based on "the
specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker"--is a
"more blatant" and "egregious form of content discrimination." Rosenberger v.
Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995). But it is well established that "[t]he
First Amendment's hostility to content-based regulation extends not only to
restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public
discussion of an entire topic." Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of N. Y. (1980).
Thus, a speech regulation targeted at specific subject matter is content based
even if it does not discriminate among viewpoints within that subject matter.
For example, a law banning the use of sound trucks for political speech--and
only political speech--would be a content-based regulation, even if it imposed
no limits on the political viewpoints that could be expressed. The Town's Sign
Code likewise singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment, even
if it does not target viewpoints within that subject matter. Ideological messages
are given more favorable treatment than messages concerning a political
candidate, which are themselves given more favorable treatment than messages
announcing an assembly of like-minded individuals. That is a paradigmatic
example of content-based discrimination.
3
Finally, the Court of Appeals characterized the Sign Code's distinctions as
turning on " 'the content-neutral elements of who is speaking through the sign
and whether and when an event is occurring.' " That analysis is mistaken on
both factual and legal grounds.
To start, the Sign Code's distinctions are not speaker based. The restrictions for
political, ideological, and temporary event signs apply equally no matter who
sponsors them. If a local business, for example, sought to put up signs
advertising the Church's meetings, those signs would be subject to the same
limitations as such signs placed by the Church. And if Reed had decided to
display signs in support of a particular candidate, he could have made those
signs far larger--and kept them up for far longer--than signs inviting people to
attend his church services. If the Code's distinctions were truly speaker based,
both types of signs would receive the same treatment.
In any case, the fact that a distinction is speaker based does not, as the Court
of Appeals seemed to believe, automatically render the distinction content
neutral. Because "[s]peech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker are
all too often simply a means to control content," Citizens United v. Federal
Election Comm'n (2010), we have insisted that "laws favoring some speakers over
others demand strict scrutiny when the legislature's speaker preference reflects
a content preference," Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC. Thus, a law
limiting the content of newspapers, but only newspapers, could not evade strict
scrutiny simply because it could be characterized as speaker based. Likewise, a
content-based law that restricted the political speech of all corporations would

Robson

536

The First Amendment

not become content neutral just because it singled out corporations as a class
of speakers. See Citizens United. Characterizing a distinction as speaker based
is only the beginning--not the end--of the inquiry.
Nor do the Sign Code's distinctions hinge on "whether and when an event is
occurring." The Code does not permit citizens to post signs on any topic
whatsoever within a set period leading up to an election, for example. Instead,
come election time, it requires Town officials to determine whether a sign is
"designed to influence the outcome of an election" (and thus "political") or
merely "communicating a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes" (and
thus "ideological"). That obvious content-based inquiry does not evade strict
scrutiny review simply because an event (i.e., an election) is involved.
And, just as with speaker-based laws, the fact that a distinction is event based
does not render it content neutral. The Court of Appeals cited no precedent
from this Court supporting its novel theory of an exception from the contentneutrality requirement for event-based laws. As we have explained, a speech
regulation is content based if the law applies to particular speech because of
the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed. A regulation that targets
a sign because it conveys an idea about a specific event is no less content based
than a regulation that targets a sign because it conveys some other idea. Here,
the Code singles out signs bearing a particular message: the time and location
of a specific event. This type of ordinance may seem like a perfectly rational way
to regulate signs, but a clear and firm rule governing content neutrality is an
essential means of protecting the freedom of speech, even if laws that might
seem "entirely reasonable" will sometimes be "struck down because of their
content-based nature." City of Ladue v. Gilleo (1994) (O'Connor, J., concurring).
III
Because the Town's Sign Code imposes content-based restrictions on speech,
those provisions can stand only if they survive strict scrutiny, " 'which requires
the Government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and
is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest,' " Arizona Free Enterprise Club's
Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett (2011). Thus, it is the Town's burden to
demonstrate that the Code's differentiation between temporary directional signs
and other types of signs, such as political signs and ideological signs, furthers a
compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to that end.
The Town cannot do so. It has offered only
support of the distinctions the Sign Code
aesthetic appeal and traffic safety. Assuming
those are compelling governmental interests,
hopelessly underinclusive.

draws: preserving the Town's
for the sake of argument that
the Code's distinctions fail as

Starting with the preservation of aesthetics, temporary directional signs are "no
greater an eyesore," Discovery Network, than ideological or political ones. Yet
the Code allows unlimited proliferation of larger ideological signs while strictly
limiting the number, size, and duration of smaller directional ones. The Town
cannot claim that placing strict limits on temporary directional signs is
necessary to beautify the Town while at the same time allowing unlimited
numbers of other types of signs that create the same problem.

Robson

537

The First Amendment

The Town similarly has not shown that limiting temporary directional signs is
necessary to eliminate threats to traffic safety, but that limiting other types of
signs is not. The Town has offered no reason to believe that directional signs
pose a greater threat to safety than do ideological or political signs. If anything,
a sharply worded ideological sign seems more likely to distract a driver than a
sign directing the public to a nearby church meeting.
In light of this underinclusiveness, the Town has not met its burden to prove
that its Sign Code is narrowly tailored to further a compelling government
interest. Because a " 'law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest of the
highest order, and thus as justifying a restriction on truthful speech, when it
leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited,' "
Republican Party of Minn. v. White (2002), the Sign Code fails strict scrutiny.
IV
Our decision today will not prevent governments from enacting effective sign
laws. The Town asserts that an " 'absolutist' " content-neutrality rule would
render "virtually all distinctions in sign laws . . . subject to strict scrutiny," but
that is not the case. Not "all distinctions" are subject to strict scrutiny, only
content-based ones are. Laws that are content neutral are instead subject to
lesser scrutiny.
The Town has ample content-neutral options available to resolve problems with
safety and aesthetics. For example, its current Code regulates many aspects of
signs that have nothing to do with a sign's message: size, building materials,
lighting, moving parts, and portability. And on public property, the Town may
go a long way toward entirely forbidding the posting of signs, so long as it does
so in an evenhanded, content-neutral manner. See Taxpayers for Vincent
(upholding content-neutral ban against posting signs on public property).
Indeed, some lower courts have long held that similar content-based sign laws
receive strict scrutiny, but there is no evidence that towns in those jurisdictions
have suffered catastrophic effects.
We acknowledge that a city might reasonably view the general regulation of
signs as necessary because signs "take up space and may obstruct views,
distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems
that legitimately call for regulation." City of Ladue. At the same time, the
presence of certain signs may be essential, both for vehicles and pedestrians, to
guide traffic or to identify hazards and ensure safety. A sign ordinance narrowly
tailored to the challenges of protecting the safety of pedestrians, drivers, and
passengers--such as warning signs marking hazards on private property, signs
directing traffic, or street numbers associated with private houses--well might
survive strict scrutiny. The signs at issue in this case, including political and
ideological signs and signs for events, are far removed from those purposes. As
discussed above, they are facially content based and are neither justified by
traditional safety concerns nor narrowly tailored.
We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

Robson

538

The First Amendment

JUSTICE ALITO, WITH WHOM JUSTICE KENNEDY AND JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR JOIN,
CONCURRING.
I join the opinion of the Court but add a few words of further explanation.
As the Court holds, what we have termed "content-based" laws must satisfy
strict scrutiny. Content-based laws merit this protection because they present,
albeit sometimes in a subtler form, the same dangers as laws that regulate
speech based on viewpoint. Limiting speech based on its "topic" or "subject"
favors those who do not want to disturb the status quo. Such regulations may
interfere with democratic self-government and the search for truth. See
Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y. (1980).
As the Court shows, the regulations at issue in this case are replete with
content-based distinctions, and as a result they must satisfy strict scrutiny.
This does not mean, however, that municipalities are powerless to enact and
enforce reasonable sign regulations. I will not attempt to provide anything like a
comprehensive list, but here are some rules that would not be content based:
Rules regulating the size of signs. These rules may distinguish among signs
based on any content-neutral criteria, including any relevant criteria listed
below.
Rules regulating the locations in which signs may be placed. These rules may
distinguish between free-standing signs and those attached to buildings.
Rules distinguishing between lighted and unlighted signs.
Rules distinguishing between signs with fixed messages and electronic signs
with messages that change.
Rules that distinguish between the placement of signs on private and public
property.
Rules distinguishing between the placement of signs on commercial and
residential property.
Rules distinguishing between on-premises and off-premises signs.
Rules restricting the total number of signs allowed per mile of roadway.
Rules imposing time restrictions on signs advertising a one-time event. Rules of
this nature do not discriminate based on topic or subject and are akin to rules
restricting the times within which oral speech or music is allowed.*

In addition to regulating signs put up by private actors, government entities
may also erect their own signs consistent with the principles that allow
governmental speech. See Pleasant Grove City v. Summum (2009). They may put
up all manner of signs to promote safety, as well as directional signs and signs
pointing out historic sites and scenic spots.
Properly understood, today's decision will not prevent cities from regulating
signs in a way that fully protects public safety and serves legitimate esthetic
objectives.

Robson

539

The First Amendment

JUSTICE BREYER, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
I join Justice Kagan's separate opinion. Like Justice Kagan I believe that
categories alone cannot satisfactorily resolve the legal problem before us. The
First Amendment requires greater judicial sensitivity both to the Amendment's
expressive objectives and to the public's legitimate need for regulation than a
simple recitation of categories, such as "content discrimination" and "strict
scrutiny," would permit. In my view, the category "content discrimination" is
better considered in many contexts, including here, as a rule of thumb, rather
than as an automatic "strict scrutiny" trigger, leading to almost certain legal
condemnation.
To use content discrimination to trigger strict scrutiny sometimes makes perfect
sense. There are cases in which the Court has found content discrimination an
unconstitutional method for suppressing a viewpoint. E.g., Rosenberger v.
Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995); see also Boos v. Barry (1988) (plurality
opinion) (applying strict scrutiny where the line between subject matter and
viewpoint was not obvious). And there are cases where the Court has found
content discrimination to reveal that rules governing a traditional public forum
are, in fact, not a neutral way of fairly managing the forum in the interest of all
speakers. Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley (1972) ("Once a forum is opened up
to assembly or speaking by some groups, government may not prohibit others
from assembling or speaking on the basis of what they intend to say"). In these
types of cases, strict scrutiny is often appropriate, and content discrimination
has thus served a useful purpose.
But content discrimination, while helping courts to identify unconstitutional
suppression of expression, cannot and should not always trigger strict scrutiny.
To say that it is not an automatic "strict scrutiny" trigger is not to argue against
that concept's use. I readily concede, for example, that content discrimination,
as a conceptual tool, can sometimes reveal weaknesses in the government's
rationale for a rule that limits speech. If, for example, a city looks to litter
prevention as the rationale for a prohibition against placing newsracks
dispensing free advertisements on public property, why does it exempt other
newsracks causing similar litter? Cf. Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc.
(1993). I also concede that, whenever government disfavors one kind of speech,
it places that speech at a disadvantage, potentially interfering with the free
marketplace of ideas and with an individual's ability to express thoughts and
ideas that can help that individual determine the kind of society in which he
wishes to live, help shape that society, and help define his place within it.
Nonetheless, in these latter instances to use the presence of content
discrimination automatically to trigger strict scrutiny and thereby call into play
a strong presumption against constitutionality goes too far. That is because
virtually all government activities involve speech, many of which involve the
regulation of speech. Regulatory programs almost always require content
discrimination. And to hold that such content discrimination triggers strict
scrutiny is to write a recipe for judicial management of ordinary government
regulatory activity.
Consider a few examples of speech regulated by government that inevitably
involve content discrimination, but where a strong presumption against

Robson

540

The First Amendment

constitutionality has no place. Consider governmental regulation of securities,
e.g., 15 U. S. C. §78l (requirements for content that must be included in a
registration statement); of energy conservation labeling-practices, e.g., 42 U. S.
C. §6294 (requirements for content that must be included on labels of certain
consumer electronics); of prescription drugs, e.g., 21 U. S. C. §353(b)(4)(A)
(requiring a prescription drug label to bear the symbol "Rx only"); of doctorpatient confidentiality, e.g., 38 U. S. C. §7332 (requiring confidentiality of
certain medical records, but allowing a physician to disclose that the patient
has HIV to the patient's spouse or sexual partner); of income tax statements,
e.g., 26 U. S. C. §6039F (requiring taxpayers to furnish information about
foreign gifts received if the aggregate amount exceeds $10,000); of commercial
airplane briefings, e.g., 14 CFR §136.7 (2015) (requiring pilots to ensure that
each passenger has been briefed on flight procedures, such as seatbelt
fastening); of signs at petting zoos, e.g., N. Y. Gen. Bus. Law Ann. §399-ff(3)
(West Cum. Supp. 2015) (requiring petting zoos to post a sign at every exit "
'strongly recommend[ing] that persons wash their hands upon exiting the
petting zoo area' "); and so on.
Nor can the majority avoid the application of strict scrutiny to all sorts of
justifiable governmental regulations by relying on this Court's many
subcategories and exceptions to the rule. The Court has said, for example, that
we should apply less strict standards to "commercial speech." Central Hudson
Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of N. Y. (1980). But I have great
concern that many justifiable instances of "content-based" regulation are
noncommercial. And, worse than that, the Court has applied the heightened
"strict scrutiny" standard even in cases where the less stringent "commercial
speech" standard was appropriate. See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc. (2011) (BREYER,
J., dissenting). The Court has also said that "government speech" escapes First
Amendment strictures. See Rust v. Sullivan (1991). But regulated speech is
typically private speech, not government speech. Further, the Court has said
that, "[w]hen the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the
very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable, no significant
danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists." R. A. V. v. St. Paul (1992). But
this exception accounts for only a few of the instances in which content
discrimination is readily justifiable.
I recognize that the Court could escape the problem by watering down the force
of the presumption against constitutionality that "strict scrutiny" normally
carries with it. But, in my view, doing so will weaken the First Amendment's
protection in instances where "strict scrutiny" should apply in full force.
The better approach is to generally treat content discrimination as a strong
reason weighing against the constitutionality of a rule where a traditional public
forum, or where viewpoint discrimination, is threatened, but elsewhere treat it
as a rule of thumb, finding it a helpful, but not determinative legal tool, in an
appropriate case, to determine the strength of a justification. I would use
content discrimination as a supplement to a more basic analysis, which,
tracking most of our First Amendment cases, asks whether the regulation at
issue works harm to First Amendment interests that is disproportionate in light
of the relevant regulatory objectives. Answering this question requires
examining the seriousness of the harm to speech, the importance of the

Robson

541

The First Amendment

countervailing objectives, the extent to which the law will achieve those
objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive ways of doing so. See,
e.g., United States v. Alvarez (2012) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment); Nixon
v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC (2000) (Breyer, J., concurring). Admittedly,
this approach does not have the simplicity of a mechanical use of categories.
But it does permit the government to regulate speech in numerous instances
where the voters have authorized the government to regulate and where courts
should hesitate to substitute judicial judgment for that of administrators.
Here, regulation of signage along the roadside, for purposes of safety and
beautification is at issue. There is no traditional public forum nor do I find any
general effort to censor a particular viewpoint. Consequently, the specific
regulation at issue does not warrant "strict scrutiny." Nonetheless, for the
reasons that Justice Kagan sets forth, I believe that the Town of Gilbert's
regulatory rules violate the First Amendment. I consequently concur in the
Court's judgment only.
JUSTICE KAGAN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE GINSBURG AND JUSTICE BREYER JOIN,
CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
Countless cities and towns across America have adopted ordinances regulating
the posting of signs, while exempting certain categories of signs based on their
subject matter. For example, some municipalities generally prohibit illuminated
signs in residential neighborhoods, but lift that ban for signs that identify the
address of a home or the name of its owner or occupant. See, e.g., City of Truth
or Consequences, N. M., Code of Ordinances, ch. 16, Art. XIII, §§11-13-2.3, 1113-2.9(H)(4) (2014). In other municipalities, safety signs such as "Blind
Pedestrian Crossing" and "Hidden Driveway" can be posted without a permit,
even as other permanent signs require one. See, e.g., Code of Athens-Clarke
County, Ga., Pt. III, §7-4-7(1) (1993). Elsewhere, historic site markers--for
example, "George Washington Slept Here"--are also exempt from general
regulations. See, e.g., Dover, Del., Code of Ordinances, Pt. II, App. B, Art. 5,
§4.5(F) (2012). And similarly, the federal Highway Beautification Act limits signs
along interstate highways unless, for instance, they direct travelers to "scenic
and historical attractions" or advertise free coffee. See 23 U. S. C. §§131(b),
(c)(1), (c)(5).
Given the Court's analysis, many sign ordinances of that kind are now in
jeopardy. Says the majority: When laws "single[ ] out specific subject matter,"
they are "facially content based"; and when they are facially content based, they
are automatically subject to strict scrutiny. And although the majority holds
out hope that some sign laws with subject-matter exemptions "might survive"
that stringent review, the likelihood is that most will be struck down. After all, it
is the "rare case[ ] in which a speech restriction withstands strict scrutiny."
Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar (2015). To clear that high bar, the government
must show that a content-based distinction "is necessary to serve a compelling
state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end." Arkansas Writers'
Project, Inc. v. Ragland (1987). So on the majority's view, courts would have to
determine that a town has a compelling interest in informing passersby where
George Washington slept. And likewise, courts would have to find that a town

Robson

542

The First Amendment

has no other way to prevent hidden-driveway mishaps than by specially treating
hidden-driveway signs. (Well-placed speed bumps? Lower speed limits? Or how
about just a ban on hidden driveways?) The consequence--unless courts water
down strict scrutiny to something unrecognizable--is that our communities will
find themselves in an unenviable bind: They will have to either repeal the
exemptions that allow for helpful signs on streets and sidewalks, or else lift
their sign restrictions altogether and resign themselves to the resulting clutter.*
Although the majority insists that applying strict scrutiny to all such
ordinances is "essential" to protecting First Amendment freedoms, I find it
challenging to understand why that is so. This Court's decisions articulate two
important and related reasons for subjecting content-based speech regulations
to the most exacting standard of review. The first is "to preserve an uninhibited
marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail." McCullen v. Coakley
(2014). The second is to ensure that the government has not regulated speech
"based on hostility--or favoritism--towards the underlying message expressed."
R. A. V. v. St. Paul (1992). Yet the subject-matter exemptions included in many
sign ordinances do not implicate those concerns. Allowing residents, say, to
install a light bulb over "name and address" signs but no others does not distort
the marketplace of ideas. Nor does that different treatment give rise to an
inference of impermissible government motive.
We apply strict scrutiny to facially content-based regulations of speech, in
keeping with the rationales just described, when there is any "realistic
possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot." R. A. V. That is always the
case when the regulation facially differentiates on the basis of viewpoint. See
Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995). It is also the case
(except in non-public or limited public forums) when a law restricts "discussion
of an entire topic" in public debate. Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public
Serv. Comm'n of N. Y. (1980) (invalidating a limitation on speech about nuclear
power). We have stated that "[i]f the marketplace of ideas is to remain free and
open, governments must not be allowed to choose 'which issues are worth
discussing or debating.' " Id. And we have recognized that such subject-matter
restrictions, even though viewpoint-neutral on their face, may "suggest[ ] an
attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in
expressing its views to the people." First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978).
Subject-matter regulation, in other words, may have the intent or effect of
favoring some ideas over others. When that is realistically possible--when the
restriction "raises the specter that the Government may effectively drive certain
ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace"--we insist that the law pass the most
demanding constitutional test. R. A. V.
But when that is not realistically possible, we may do well to relax our guard so
that "entirely reasonable" laws imperiled by strict scrutiny can survive. This
point is by no means new. Our concern with content-based regulation arises
from the fear that the government will skew the public's debate of ideas--so
when "that risk is inconsequential, . . . strict scrutiny is unwarranted." To do its
intended work, of course, the category of content-based regulation triggering
strict scrutiny must sweep more broadly than the actual harm; that category
exists to create a buffer zone guaranteeing that the government cannot favor or
disfavor certain viewpoints. But that buffer zone need not extend forever. We

Robson

543

The First Amendment

can administer our content-regulation doctrine with a dose of common sense,
so as to leave standing laws that in no way implicate its intended function.
And indeed we have done just that: Our cases have been far less rigid than the
majority admits in applying strict scrutiny to facially content-based laws-including in cases just like this one. In Members of City Council of Los Angeles
v. Taxpayers for Vincent (1984), the Court declined to apply strict scrutiny to a
municipal ordinance that exempted address numbers and markers
commemorating "historical, cultural, or artistic event[s]" from a generally
applicable limit on sidewalk signs. After all, we explained, the law's enactment
and enforcement revealed "not even a hint of bias or censorship." And another
decision involving a similar law provides an alternative model. In City of Ladue
v. Gilleo (1994), the Court assumed arguendo that a sign ordinance's exceptions
for address signs, safety signs, and for-sale signs in residential areas did not
trigger strict scrutiny. We did not need to, and so did not, decide the level-ofscrutiny question because the law's breadth made it unconstitutional under
any standard.
The majority could easily have taken Ladue's tack here. The Town of Gilbert's
defense of its sign ordinance--most notably, the law's distinctions between
directional signs and others--does not pass strict scrutiny, or intermediate
scrutiny, or even the laugh test. The Town, for example, provides no reason at
all for prohibiting more than four directional signs on a property while placing
no limits on the number of other types of signs. Similarly, the Town offers no
coherent justification for restricting the size of directional signs to 6 square feet
while allowing other signs to reach 20 square feet. The best the Town could
come up with at oral argument was that directional signs "need to be smaller
because they need to guide travelers along a route." Why exactly a smaller sign
better helps travelers get to where they are going is left a mystery. The absence
of any sensible basis for these and other distinctions dooms the Town's
ordinance under even the intermediate scrutiny that the Court typically applies
to "time, place, or manner" speech regulations. Accordingly, there is no need to
decide in this case whether strict scrutiny applies to every sign ordinance in
every town across this country containing a subject-matter exemption.
I suspect this Court and others will regret the majority's insistence today on
answering that question in the affirmative. As the years go by, courts will
discover that thousands of towns have such ordinances, many of them "entirely
reasonable." And as the challenges to them mount, courts will have to
invalidate one after the other. (This Court may soon find itself a veritable
Supreme Board of Sign Review.) And courts will strike down those
democratically enacted local laws even though no one--certainly not the
majority--has ever explained why the vindication of First Amendment values
requires that result. Because I see no reason why such an easy case calls for us
to cast a constitutional pall on reasonable regulations quite unlike the law
before us, I concur only in the judgment.

JUSTICE ALITO DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
This case presents the question whether the Free Speech Clause of the First
Amendment entitles a private group to insist that a municipality permit it to
place a permanent monument in a city park in which other donated
monuments were previously erected. The Court of Appeals held that the
municipality was required to accept the monument because a public park is a
traditional public forum. We conclude, however, that although a park is a
traditional public forum for speeches and other transitory expressive acts, the
display of a permanent monument in a public park is not a form of expression
to which forum analysis applies. Instead, the placement of a permanent
monument in a public park is best viewed as a form of government speech and
is therefore not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause.
I
A
Pioneer Park (or Park) is a 2.5 acre public park located in the Historic District of
Pleasant Grove City (or City) in Utah. The Park currently contains 15
permanent displays, at least 11 of which were donated by private groups or
individuals. These include an historic granary, a wishing well, the City's first
fire station, a September 11 monument, and a Ten Commandments monument
donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles in 1971.
Respondent Summum is a religious organization founded in 1975 and
headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. On two separate occasions in 2003,
Summum's president wrote a letter to the City's mayor requesting permission to

Robson

545

The First Amendment

erect a "stone monument," which would contain "the Seven Aphorisms of
SUMMUM" and be similar in size and nature to the Ten Commandments
monument. The City denied the requests and explained that its practice was to
limit monuments in the Park to those that "either (1) directly relate to the
history of Pleasant Grove, or (2) were donated by groups with longstanding ties
to the Pleasant Grove community." The following year, the City passed a
resolution putting this policy into writing. The resolution also mentioned other
criteria, such as safety and esthetics.
In May 2005, respondent's president again wrote to the mayor asking to erect a
monument, but the letter did not describe the monument, its historical
significance, or Summum's connection to the community. The city council
rejected this request.
B
In 2005, respondent filed this action against the City and various local officials
(petitioners), asserting, among other claims, that petitioners had violated the
Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment by accepting the Ten
Commandments monument but rejecting the proposed Seven Aphorisms
monument. Respondent sought a preliminary injunction directing the City to
permit Summum to erect its monument in Pioneer Park. After the District Court
denied Summum's preliminary injunction request, respondent appealed,
pressing solely its free speech claim.
A panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed. The panel noted that it had previously
found the Ten Commandments monument to be private rather than
government speech. Noting that public parks have traditionally been regarded
as public forums, the panel held that the City could not reject the Seven
Aphorisms monument unless it had a compelling justification that could not be
served by more narrowly tailored means. The panel then concluded that the
exclusion of respondent's monument was unlikely to survive this strict scrutiny,
and the panel therefore held that the City was required to erect Summum's
monument immediately.
The Tenth Circuit denied the City's petition for rehearing en banc by an equally
divided vote. Judge Lucero dissented, arguing that the Park was not a
traditional public forum for the purpose of displaying monuments. Judge
McConnell also dissented, contending that the monuments in the Park
constitute government speech.
We granted certiorari and now reverse.
II
No prior decision of this Court has addressed the application of the Free Speech
Clause to a government entity's acceptance of privately donated, permanent
monuments for installation in a public park, and the parties disagree sharply
about the line of precedents that governs this situation. Petitioners contend
that the pertinent cases are those concerning government speech. Respondent,
on the other hand, agrees with the Court of Appeals panel that the applicable
cases are those that analyze private speech in a public forum. The parties'
fundamental disagreement thus centers on the nature of petitioners' conduct
when they permitted privately donated monuments to be erected in Pioneer

Robson

546

The First Amendment

Park. Were petitioners engaging in their own expressive conduct? Or were they
providing a forum for private speech?
A
If petitioners were engaging in their own expressive conduct, then the Free
Speech Clause has no application. The Free Speech Clause restricts
government regulation of private speech; it does not regulate government
speech. A government entity has the right to "speak for itself." Board of Regents
of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth (2000). "[I]t is entitled to say what it
wishes," Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995), and to select
the views that it wants to express. See Rust v. Sullivan (1991); National
Endowment for Arts v. Finley (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("It is
the very business of government to favor and disfavor points of view").
Indeed, it is not easy to imagine how government could function if it lacked this
freedom. ***
A government entity may exercise this same freedom to express its views when
it receives assistance from private sources for the purpose of delivering a
government-controlled message. ***
This does not mean that there are no restraints on government speech. For
example, government speech must comport with the Establishment Clause. The
involvement of public officials in advocacy may be limited by law, regulation, or
practice. And of course, a government entity is ultimately "accountable to the
electorate and the political process for its advocacy." Southworth. "If the
citizenry objects, newly elected officials later could espouse some different or
contrary position." Id.
B
While government speech is not restricted by the Free Speech Clause, the
government does not have a free hand to regulate private speech on government
property. This Court long ago recognized that members of the public retain
strong free speech rights when they venture into public streets and parks,
"which 'have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time
out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating
thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.' " Perry Ed. Assn. v.
Perry Local Educators' Assn. (1983) (quoting Hague v. Committee for Industrial
Organization (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.)). In order to preserve this freedom,
government entities are strictly limited in their ability to regulate private speech
in such "traditional public fora." Reasonable time, place, and manner
restrictions are allowed, see Perry Ed. Assn, but any restriction based on the
content of the speech must satisfy strict scrutiny, that is, the restriction must
be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest, and restrictions
based on viewpoint are prohibited.
With the concept of the traditional public forum as a starting point, this Court
has recognized that members of the public have free speech rights on other
types of government property and in certain other government programs that
share essential attributes of a traditional public forum. We have held that a
government entity may create "a designated public forum" if government
property that has not traditionally been regarded as a public forum is

Robson

547

The First Amendment

intentionally opened up for that purpose. Government restrictions on speech in
a designated public forum are subject to the same strict scrutiny as restrictions
in a traditional public forum.
The Court has also held that a government entity may create a forum that is
limited to use by certain groups or dedicated solely to the discussion of certain
subjects. Perry Ed. Assn. In such a forum, a government entity may impose
restrictions on speech that are reasonable and viewpoint-neutral.
III
There may be situations in which it is difficult to tell whether a government
entity is speaking on its own behalf or is providing a forum for private speech,
but this case does not present such a situation. Permanent monuments
displayed on public property typically represent government speech.
Governments have long used monuments to speak to the public. Since ancient
times, kings, emperors, and other rulers have erected statues of themselves to
remind their subjects of their authority and power. Triumphal arches, columns,
and other monuments have been built to commemorate military victories and
sacrifices and other events of civic importance. A monument, by definition, is a
structure that is designed as a means of expression. When a government entity
arranges for the construction of a monument, it does so because it wishes to
convey some thought or instill some feeling in those who see the structure.
Neither the Court of Appeals nor respondent disputes the obvious proposition
that a monument that is commissioned and financed by a government body for
placement on public land constitutes government speech.
Just as government-commissioned and government-financed monuments speak
for the government, so do privately financed and donated monuments that the
government accepts and displays to the public on government land. It certainly
is not common for property owners to open up their property for the installation
of permanent monuments that convey a message with which they do not wish
to be associated. And because property owners typically do not permit the
construction of such monuments on their land, persons who observe donated
monuments routinely--and reasonably--interpret them as conveying some
message on the property owner's behalf. In this context, there is little chance
that observers will fail to appreciate the identity of the speaker. This is true
whether the monument is located on private property or on public property,
such as national, state, or city park land.
We think it is fair to say that throughout our Nation's history, the general
government practice with respect to donated monuments has been one of
selective receptivity. A great many of the monuments that adorn the Nation's
public parks were financed with private funds or donated by private parties.
Sites managed by the National Park Service contain thousands of privately
designed or funded commemorative objects, including the Statue of Liberty, the
Marine Corps War Memorial (the Iwo Jima monument), and the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial. States and cities likewise have received thousands of
donated monuments. By accepting monuments that are privately funded or
donated, government entities save tax dollars and are able to acquire
monuments that they could not have afforded to fund on their own.

Robson

548

The First Amendment

But while government entities regularly accept privately funded or donated
monuments, they have exercised selectivity. An example discussed by the city of
New York as amicus curiae is illustrative. In the wake of the controversy
generated in 1876 when the city turned down a donated monument to honor
Daniel Webster, the city adopted rules governing the acceptance of artwork for
permanent placement in city parks, requiring, among other things, that "any
proposed gift of art had to be viewed either in its finished condition or as a
model before acceptance." Brief for City of New York as Amicus Curiae 4-5
(hereinafter NYC Brief). Across the country, "municipalities generally exercise
editorial control over donated monuments through prior submission
requirements, design input, requested modifications, written criteria, and
legislative approvals of specific content proposals."
Public parks are often closely identified in the public mind with the government
unit that owns the land. City parks--ranging from those in small towns, like
Pioneer Park in Pleasant Grove City, to those in major metropolises, like Central
Park in New York City--commonly play an important role in defining the identity
that a city projects to its own residents and to the outside world. Accordingly,
cities and other jurisdictions take some care in accepting donated monuments.
Government decisionmakers select the monuments that portray what they view
as appropriate for the place in question, taking into account such contentbased factors as esthetics, history, and local culture. The monuments that are
accepted, therefore, are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a
government message, and they thus constitute government speech.
IV
A
In this case, it is clear that the monuments in Pleasant Grove's Pioneer Park
represent government speech. Although many of the monuments were not
designed or built by the City and were donated in completed form by private
entities, the City decided to accept those donations and to display them in the
Park. Respondent does not claim that the City ever opened up the Park for the
placement of whatever permanent monuments might be offered by private
donors. Rather, the City has "effectively controlled" the messages sent by the
monuments in the Park by exercising "final approval authority" over their
selection. The City has selected those monuments that it wants to display for
the purpose of presenting the image of the City that it wishes to project to all
who frequent the Park; it has taken ownership of most of the monuments in the
Park, including the Ten Commandments monument that is the focus of
respondent's concern; and the City has now expressly set forth the criteria it
will use in making future selections.
B
Respondent voices the legitimate concern that the government speech doctrine
not be used as a subterfuge for favoring certain private speakers over others
based on viewpoint. Respondent's suggested solution is to require a government
entity accepting a privately donated monument to go through a formal process
of adopting a resolution publicly embracing "the message" that the monument
conveys.

Robson

549

The First Amendment

We see no reason for imposing a requirement of this sort. The parks of this
country contain thousands of donated monuments that government entities
have used for their own expressive purposes, usually without producing the
sort of formal documentation that respondent now says is required to escape
Free Speech Clause restrictions. Requiring all of these jurisdictions to go back
and proclaim formally that they adopt all of these monuments as their own
expressive vehicles would be a pointless exercise that the Constitution does not
mandate.
In this case, for example, although respondent argues that Pleasant Grove City
has not adequately "controll[ed] the message" of the Ten Commandments
monument, the City took ownership of that monument and put it on permanent
display in a park that it owns and manages and that is linked to the City's
identity. All rights previously possessed by the monument's donor have been
relinquished. The City's actions provided a more dramatic form of adoption than
the sort of formal endorsement that respondent would demand, unmistakably
signifying to all Park visitors that the City intends the monument to speak on
its behalf. And the City has made no effort to abridge the traditional free speech
rights--the right to speak, distribute leaflets, etc.--that may be exercised by
respondent and others in Pioneer Park.
What respondent demands, however, is that the City "adopt" or "embrace" "the
message" that it associates with the monument. Respondent seems to think
that a monument can convey only one "message"--which is, presumably, the
message intended by the donor--and that, if a government entity that accepts a
monument for placement on its property does not formally embrace that
message, then the government has not engaged in expressive conduct.
This argument fundamentally misunderstands the way monuments convey
meaning. *** Even when a monument features the written word, the monument
may be intended to be interpreted, and may in fact be interpreted by different
observers, in a variety of ways. Monuments called to our attention by the
briefing in this case illustrate this phenomenon.
What, for example, is "the message" of the Greco-Roman mosaic of the word
"Imagine" that was donated to New York City's Central Park in memory of John
Lennon? See NYC Brief 18. Some observers may "imagine" the musical
contributions that John Lennon would have made if he had not been killed.
Others may think of the lyrics of the Lennon song that obviously inspired the
mosaic and may "imagine" a world without religion, countries, possessions,
greed, or hunger. [FN 2 contains the lyrics to “Imagine”].
Or, to take another example, what is "the message" of the "large bronze statue
displaying the word 'peace' in many world languages" that is displayed in
Fayetteville, Arkansas?
These text-based monuments are almost certain to evoke different thoughts and
sentiments in the minds of different observers, and the effect of monuments
that do not contain text is likely to be even more variable. Consider, for example,
the statue of Pancho Villa that was given to the city of Tucson, Arizona, in 1981
by the Government of Mexico with, according to a Tucson publication, "a wry
sense of irony." Does this statue commemorate a "revolutionary leader who
advocated for agrarian reform and the poor" or "a violent bandit"?

Robson

550

The First Amendment

Contrary to respondent's apparent belief, it frequently is not possible to identify
a single "message" that is conveyed by an object or structure, and consequently,
the thoughts or sentiments expressed by a government entity that accepts and
displays such an object may be quite different from those of either its creator or
its donor. By accepting a privately donated monument and placing it on city
property, a city engages in expressive conduct, but the intended and perceived
significance of that conduct may not coincide with the thinking of the
monument's donor or creator. Indeed, when a privately donated memorial is
funded by many small donations, the donors themselves may differ in their
interpretation of the monument's significance. By accepting such a monument,
a government entity does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning that any
particular donor sees in the monument.
The message that a government entity conveys by allowing a monument to
remain on its property may also be altered by the subsequent addition of other
monuments in the same vicinity. For example, following controversy over the
original design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a compromise was reached
that called for the nearby addition of a flagstaff and bronze Three Soldiers
statue, which many believed changed the overall effect of the memorial. See,
e.g., J. MAYO, WAR MEMORIALS AS POLITICAL LANDSCAPE: THE AMERICAN
EXPERIENCE AND BEYOND 202-203, 205 (1988); K. HASS, CARRIED TO THE WALL:
AMERICAN MEMORY AND THE VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL 15-18 (1998).
The "message" conveyed by a monument may change over time. A study of war
memorials found that "people reinterpret" the meaning of these memorials as
"historical interpretations" and "the society around them changes."
A striking example of how the interpretation of a monument can evolve is
provided by one of the most famous and beloved public monuments in the
United States, the Statue of Liberty. The statue was given to this country by the
Third French Republic to express republican solidarity and friendship between
the two countries. See J. Res. 6, 44th Cong., 2d Sess. (1877), 19 Stat. 410
(accepting the statue as an "expressive and felicitous memorial of the sympathy
of the citizens of our sister Republic"). At the inaugural ceremony, President
Cleveland saw the statue as an emblem of international friendship and the
widespread influence of American ideals. See Inauguration of the Statue of
Liberty Enlightening the World 30 (1887). Only later did the statue come to be
viewed as a beacon welcoming immigrants to a land of freedom. See Public
Papers of the Presidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. 2, July 3, 1986, pp. 918-919
(1989), Remarks at the Opening Ceremonies of the Statue of Liberty Centennial
Celebration in New York, New York; J. Higham, The Transformation of the
Statue of Liberty, in Send These To Me 74-80 (rev. ed. 1984).
C
Respondent and the Court of Appeals analogize the installation of permanent
monuments in a public park to the delivery of speeches and the holding of
marches and demonstrations, and they thus invoke the rule that a public park
is a traditional public forum for these activities. But "public forum principles . . .
are out of place in the context of this case." United States v. American Library
Assn., Inc. (2003). The forum doctrine has been applied in situations in which
government-owned property or a government program was capable of

Robson

551

The First Amendment

accommodating a large number of public speakers without defeating the
essential function of the land or the program. For example, a park can
accommodate many speakers and, over time, many parades and
demonstrations. The Combined Federal Campaign permits hundreds of groups
to solicit donations from federal employees. A public university's student
activity fund can provide money for many campus activities. A public
university's buildings may offer meeting space for hundreds of student groups.
A school system's internal mail facilities can support the transmission of many
messages to and from teachers and school administrators.
By contrast, public parks can accommodate only a limited number of
permanent monuments. Public parks have been used, " 'time out of mind, . . .
for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and
discussing public questions,' " Perry Ed. Assn. (quoting Hague), but "one would
be hard pressed to find a 'long tradition' of allowing people to permanently
occupy public space with any manner of monuments." (Lucero, J., dissenting
from denial of rehearing en banc) [in Tenth Circuit].
Speakers, no matter how long-winded, eventually come to the end of their
remarks; persons distributing leaflets and carrying signs at some point tire and
go home; monuments, however, endure. They monopolize the use of the land on
which they stand and interfere permanently with other uses of public space. A
public park, over the years, can provide a soapbox for a very large number of
orators--often, for all who want to speak--but it is hard to imagine how a public
park could be opened up for the installation of permanent monuments by every
person or group wishing to engage in that form of expression.
Respondent contends that this issue "can be dealt with through content-neutral
time, place and manner restrictions, including the option of a ban on all
unattended displays." On this view, when France presented the Statue of
Liberty to the United States in 1884, this country had the option of either (a)
declining France's offer or (b) accepting the gift, but providing a comparable
location in the harbor of New York for other statues of a similar size and nature
(e.g., a Statue of Autocracy, if one had been offered by, say, the German Empire
or Imperial Russia).
While respondent and some of its amici deride the fears expressed about the
consequences of the Court of Appeals holding in this case, those concerns are
well founded. If government entities must maintain viewpoint neutrality in their
selection of donated monuments, they must either "brace themselves for an
influx of clutter" or face the pressure to remove longstanding and cherished
monuments. (McConnell, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)[in
Tenth Circuit]. Every jurisdiction that has accepted a donated war memorial
may be asked to provide equal treatment for a donated monument questioning
the cause for which the veterans fought. New York City, having accepted a
donated statue of one heroic dog (Balto, the sled dog who brought medicine to
Nome, Alaska, during a diphtheria epidemic) may be pressed to accept
monuments for other dogs who are claimed to be equally worthy of
commemoration. The obvious truth of the matter is that if public parks were
considered to be traditional public forums for the purpose of erecting privately
donated monuments, most parks would have little choice but to refuse all such
donations. And where the application of forum analysis would lead almost

Robson

552

The First Amendment

inexorably to closing of the forum, it is obvious that forum analysis is out of
place.
*** To be sure, there are limited circumstances in which the forum doctrine
might properly be applied to a permanent monument--for example, if a town
created a monument on which all of its residents (or all those meeting some
other criterion) could place the name of a person to be honored or some other
private message. But as a general matter, forum analysis simply does not apply
to the installation of permanent monuments on public property.
V
In sum, we hold that the City's decision to accept certain privately donated
monuments while rejecting respondent's is best viewed as a form of government
speech. As a result, the City's decision is not subject to the Free Speech Clause,
and the Court of Appeals erred in holding otherwise. We therefore reverse.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE GINSBURG JOINS, CONCURRING.
This case involves a property owner's rejection of an offer to place a permanent
display on its land. While I join the Court's persuasive opinion, I think the
reasons justifying the city's refusal would have been equally valid if its
acceptance of the monument, instead of being characterized as "government
speech," had merely been deemed an implicit endorsement of the donor's
message.
To date, our decisions relying on the recently minted government speech
doctrine to uphold government action have been few and, in my view, of
doubtful merit. See, e.g., Garcetti v. Ceballos (2006); Johanns v. Livestock
Marketing Assn., (2005); Rust v. Sullivan (1991). The Court's opinion in this case
signals no expansion of that doctrine. And by joining the Court's opinion, I do
not mean to indicate agreement with our earlier decisions. Unlike other
decisions relying on the government speech doctrine, our decision in this case
excuses no retaliation for, or coercion of, private speech. Cf. Garcetti (Souter, J.,
dissenting); Rust (Blackmun, J., dissenting). Nor is it likely, given the near
certainty that observers will associate permanent displays with the
governmental property owner, that the government will be able to avoid political
accountability for the views that it endorses or expresses through this means.
Cf. Johanns (Souter, J., dissenting). Finally, recognizing permanent displays on
public property as government speech will not give the government free license
to communicate offensive or partisan messages. For even if the Free Speech
Clause neither restricts nor protects government speech, government speakers
are bound by the Constitution's other proscriptions, including those supplied
by the Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses. Together with the checks
imposed by our democratic processes, these constitutional safeguards ensure
that the effect of today's decision will be limited.
JUSTICE SCALIA, WITH WHOM JUSTICE THOMAS JOINS, CONCURRING.

Robson

553

The First Amendment

As framed and argued by the parties, this case presents a question under the
Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. I agree with the Court's analysis of
that question and join its opinion in full. But it is also obvious that from the
start, the case has been litigated in the shadow of the First Amendment's
Establishment Clause: the city wary of associating itself too closely with the Ten
Commandments monument displayed in the park, lest that be deemed a breach
in the so-called "wall of separation between church and State," Reynolds v.
United States (1879).***
JUSTICE BREYER, CONCURRING.
I agree with the Court and join its opinion. I do so, however, on the
understanding that the "government speech" doctrine is a rule of thumb, not a
rigid category. Were the City to discriminate in the selection of permanent
monuments on grounds unrelated to the display's theme, say solely on political
grounds, its action might well violate the First Amendment.
In my view, courts must apply categories such as "government speech," "public
forums," "limited public forums," and "nonpublic forums" with an eye towards
their purposes--lest we turn "free speech" doctrine into a jurisprudence of labels.
Consequently, we must sometimes look beyond an initial categorization. And, in
doing so, it helps to ask whether a government action burdens speech
disproportionately in light of the action's tendency to further a legitimate
government objective.
Were we to do so here, we would find--for reasons that the Court sets forth-that the City's action, while preventing Summum from erecting its monument,
does not disproportionately restrict Summum's freedom of expression. The City
has not closed off its parks to speech; no one claims that the City prevents
Summum's members from engaging in speech in a form more transient than a
permanent monument. Rather, the City has simply reserved some space in the
park for projects designed to further other than free-speech goals. And that is
perfectly proper. After all, parks do not serve speech-related interests alone. To
the contrary, cities use park space to further a variety of recreational, historical,
educational, aesthetic, and other civic interests. To reserve to the City the
power to pick and choose among proposed monuments according to criteria
reasonably related to one or more of these legitimate ends restricts Summum's
expression, but, given the impracticality of alternatives and viewed in light of
the City's legitimate needs, the restriction is not disproportionate. Analyzed
either way, as "government speech" or as a proportionate restriction on
Summum's expression, the City's action here is lawful.
JUSTICE SOUTER, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
I agree with the Court that the Ten Commandments monument is government
speech, that is, an expression of a government's position on the moral and
religious issues raised by the subject of the monument. And although the
government should lose when the character of the speech is at issue and its
governmental nature has not been made clear, I also agree with the Court that
the city need not satisfy the particular formality urged by Summum as a

Robson

The First Amendment

condition of recognizing that the expression here falls within the public category.
I have qualms, however, about accepting the position that public monuments
are government speech categorically.
Because the government speech doctrine, as Justice Stevens notes (concurring
opinion), is "recently minted," it would do well for us to go slow in setting its
bounds, which will affect existing doctrine in ways not yet explored. Even
though, for example, Establishment Clause issues have been neither raised nor
briefed before us, there is no doubt that this case and its government speech
claim has been litigated by the parties with one eye on the Establishment
Clause, see (Scalia, J., concurring). The interaction between the "government
speech doctrine" and Establishment Clause principles has not, however, begun
to be worked out.
The case shows that it may not be easy to work out. ***

BREYER, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH THOMAS, GINSBURG, SOTOMAYOR,
AND KAGAN, JJ., JOINED. ALITO, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH ROBERTS, C. J., AND
SCALIA AND KENNEDY, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE BREYER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Texas offers automobile owners a choice between ordinary and specialty license
plates. Those who want the State to issue a particular specialty plate may
propose a plate design, comprising a slogan, a graphic, or (most commonly)
both. If the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board approves the design, the
State will make it available for display on vehicles registered in Texas.
In this case, the Texas Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans proposed a
specialty license plate design featuring a Confederate battle flag. The Board
rejected the proposal. We must decide whether that rejection violated the
Constitution's free speech guarantees. We conclude that it did not.
I
A
Texas law requires all motor vehicles operating on the State's roads to display
valid license plates. And Texas makes available several kinds of plates. Drivers
may choose to display the State's general-issue license plates. Each of these
plates contains the word "Texas," a license plate number, a silhouette of the
State, a graphic of the Lone Star, and the slogan "The Lone Star State." In the
alternative, drivers may choose from an assortment of specialty license plates.
Each of these plates contains the word "Texas," a license plate number, and one
of a selection of designs prepared by the State. Finally, Texas law provides for
personalized plates (also known as vanity plates). Pursuant to the
personalization program, a vehicle owner may request a particular
alphanumeric pattern for use as a plate number, such as "BOB" or "TEXPL8."

Robson

555

The First Amendment

Here we are concerned only with the second category of plates, namely specialty
license plates, not with the personalization program. Texas offers vehicle owners
a variety of specialty plates, generally for an annual fee. And Texas selects the
designs for specialty plates through three distinct processes.
First, the state legislature may specifically call for the development of a
specialty license plate. The legislature has enacted statutes authorizing, for
example, plates that say "Keep Texas Beautiful" and "Mothers Against Drunk
Driving," plates that "honor" the Texas citrus industry, and plates that feature
an image of the World Trade Center towers and the words "Fight Terrorism."
Second, the Board may approve a specialty plate design proposal that a statedesignated private vendor has created at the request of an individual or
organization. Among the plates created through the private-vendor process are
plates promoting the "Keller Indians" and plates with the slogan "Get it Sold
with RE/MAX."
Third, the Board "may create new specialty license plates on its own initiative or
on receipt of an application from a" nonprofit entity seeking to sponsor a
specialty plate. A nonprofit must include in its application "a draft design of the
specialty license plate." And Texas law vests in the Board authority to approve
or to disapprove an application. The relevant statute says that the Board "may
refuse to create a new specialty license plate" for a number of reasons, for
example "if the design might be offensive to any member of the public . . . or for
any other reason established by rule." Specialty plates that the Board has
sanctioned through this process include plates featuring the words "The Gator
Nation," together with the Florida Gators logo, and plates featuring the logo of
Rotary International and the words "SERVICE ABOVE SELF."
B
In 2009, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Texas Division (a nonprofit entity),
applied to sponsor a specialty license plate through this last-mentioned
process. SCV's application included a draft plate design. At the bottom of the
proposed plate were the words "SONS OF CONFEDERATE VETERANS." At the
side was the organization's logo, a square Confederate battle flag framed by the
words "Sons of Confederate Veterans 1896." A faint Confederate battle flag
appeared in the background on the lower portion of the plate. Additionally, in
the middle of the plate was the license plate number, and at the top was the
State's name and silhouette. The Board's predecessor denied this application.
In 2010, SCV renewed its application before the Board. The Board invited
public comment on its website and at an open meeting. After considering the
responses, including a number of letters sent by elected officials who opposed
the proposal, the Board voted unanimously against issuing the plate. The Board
explained that it had found "it necessary to deny th[e] plate design application,
specifically the confederate flag portion of the design, because public comments
ha[d] shown that many members of the general public find the design offensive,
and because such comments are reasonable." The Board added "that a
significant portion of the public associate the confederate flag with
organizations advocating expressions of hate directed toward people or groups
that is demeaning to those people or groups."

Robson

556

The First Amendment

In 2012, SCV and two of its officers (collectively SCV) brought this lawsuit
against the chairman and members of the Board (collectively Board). SCV
argued that the Board's decision violated the Free Speech Clause of the First
Amendment, and it sought an injunction requiring the Board to approve the
proposed plate design. The District Court entered judgment for the Board. A
divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. It held that
Texas's specialty license plate designs are private speech and that the Board, in
refusing to approve SCV's design, engaged in constitutionally forbidden
viewpoint discrimination. The dissenting judge argued that Texas's specialty
license plate designs are government speech, the content of which the State is
free to control.
We granted the Board's petition for certiorari, and we now reverse.
II
When government speaks, it is not barred by the Free Speech Clause from
determining the content of what it says. Pleasant Grove City v. Summum (2009).
That freedom in part reflects the fact that it is the democratic electoral process
that first and foremost provides a check on government speech. See Board of
Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth (2000). Thus, government
statements (and government actions and programs that take the form of
speech) do not normally trigger the First Amendment rules designed to protect
the marketplace of ideas. See Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn. (2005).
Instead, the Free Speech Clause helps produce informed opinions among
members of the public, who are then able to influence the choices of a
government that, through words and deeds, will reflect its electoral mandate.
See Stromberg v. California (1931) (observing that "our constitutional system"
seeks to maintain "the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that
government may be responsive to the will of the people").
Were the Free Speech Clause interpreted otherwise, government would not
work. How could a city government create a successful recycling program if
officials, when writing householders asking them to recycle cans and bottles,
had to include in the letter a long plea from the local trash disposal enterprise
demanding the contrary? How could a state government effectively develop
programs designed to encourage and provide vaccinations, if officials also had
to voice the perspective of those who oppose this type of immunization? "[I]t is
not easy to imagine how government could function if it lacked th[e] freedom" to
select the messages it wishes to convey. Summum.
We have therefore refused "[t]o hold that the Government unconstitutionally
discriminates on the basis of viewpoint when it chooses to fund a program
dedicated to advance certain permissible goals, because the program in
advancing those goals necessarily discourages alternative goals." Rust v.
Sullivan (1991). We have pointed out that a contrary holding "would render
numerous Government programs constitutionally suspect." Ibid. Cf. Keller v.
State Bar of Cal. (1990) ("If every citizen were to have a right to insist that no
one paid by public funds express a view with which he disagreed, debate over
issues of great concern to the public would be limited to those in the private
sector, and the process of government as we know it radically transformed").
And we have made clear that "the government can speak for itself." Southworth.

Robson

557

The First Amendment

That is not to say that a government's ability to express itself is without
restriction. Constitutional and statutory provisions outside of the Free Speech
Clause may limit government speech. Summum. And the Free Speech Clause
itself may constrain the government's speech if, for example, the government
seeks to compel private persons to convey the government's speech. But, as a
general matter, when the government speaks it is entitled to promote a
program, to espouse a policy, or to take a position. In doing so, it represents its
citizens and it carries out its duties on their behalf.
III
In our view, specialty license plates issued pursuant to Texas's statutory
scheme convey government speech. Our reasoning rests primarily on our
analysis in Summum, a recent case that presented a similar problem. We
conclude here, as we did there, that our precedents regarding government
speech (and not our precedents regarding forums for private speech) provide the
appropriate framework through which to approach the case.
A
In Summum, we considered a religious organization's request to erect in a 2.5acre city park a monument setting forth the organization's religious tenets. ***
We held that the city had not "provid[ed] a forum for private speech" with
respect to monuments. Rather, the city, even when "accepting a privately
donated monument and placing it on city property," had "engage[d] in
expressive conduct." The speech at issue, this Court decided, was "best viewed
as a form of government speech" and "therefore [was] not subject to scrutiny
under the Free Speech Clause."
We based our conclusion on several factors. First, history shows that
"[g]overnments have long used monuments to speak to the public." Thus, we
observed that "[w]hen a government entity arranges for the construction of a
monument, it does so because it wishes to convey some thought or instill some
feeling in those who see the structure."
Second, we noted that it "is not common for property owners to open up their
property for the installation of permanent monuments that convey a message
with which they do not wish to be associated." As a result, "persons who
observe donated monuments routinely--and reasonably--interpret them as
conveying some message on the property owner's behalf." And "observers" of
such monuments, as a consequence, ordinarily "appreciate the identity of the
speaker."
Third, we found relevant the fact that the city maintained control over the
selection of monuments. We thought it "fair to say that throughout our Nation's
history, the general government practice with respect to donated monuments
has been one of selective receptivity." And we observed that the city government
in Summum " 'effectively controlled' the messages sent by the monuments in the
[p]ark by exercising 'final approval authority' over their selection."
In light of these and a few other relevant considerations, the Court concluded
that the expression at issue was government speech. And, in reaching that
conclusion, the Court rejected the premise that the involvement of private

Robson

558

The First Amendment

parties in designing the monuments was sufficient to prevent the government
from controlling which monuments it placed in its own public park.
B
Our analysis in Summum leads us to the conclusion that here, too, government
speech is at issue. First, the history of license plates shows that, insofar as
license plates have conveyed more than state names and vehicle identification
numbers, they long have communicated messages from the States. In 1917,
Arizona became the first State to display a graphic on its plates. J. FOX, LICENSE
PLATES OF THE UNITED STATES (1997); J. MINARD & T. STENTIFORD, A MOVING
HISTORY (2004). The State presented a depiction of the head of a Hereford steer.
In the years since, New Hampshire plates have featured the profile of the "Old
Man of the Mountain," Massachusetts plates have included a representation of
the Commonwealth's famous codfish, and Wyoming plates have displayed a
rider atop a bucking bronco.
In 1928, Idaho became the first State to include a slogan on its plates. The
1928 Idaho plate proclaimed "Idaho Potatoes" and featured an illustration of a
brown potato, onto which the license plate number was superimposed in green.
The brown potato did not catch on, but slogans on license plates did. Over the
years, state plates have included the phrases "North to the Future" (Alaska),
"Keep Florida Green" (Florida), "Hoosier Hospitality" (Indiana), "The Iodine
Products State" (South Carolina), "Green Mountains" (Vermont), and "America's
Dairyland" (Wisconsin). States have used license plate slogans to urge action, to
promote tourism, and to tout local industries.
Texas, too, has selected various messages to communicate through its license
plate designs. By 1919, Texas had begun to display the Lone Star emblem on
its plates. In 1936, the State's general-issue plates featured the first slogan on
Texas license plates: the word "Centennial." In 1968, Texas plates promoted a
San Antonio event by including the phrase "Hemisfair 68." In 1977, Texas
replaced the Lone Star with a small silhouette of the State. And in 1995, Texas
plates celebrated "150 Years of Statehood." Additionally, the Texas Legislature
has specifically authorized specialty plate designs stating, among other things,
"Read to Succeed," "Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo," "Texans Conquer
Cancer," and "Girl Scouts." This kind of state speech has appeared on Texas
plates for decades.
Second, Texas license plate designs "are often closely identified in the public
mind with the [State]." Each Texas license plate is a government article serving
the governmental purposes of vehicle registration and identification. The
governmental nature of the plates is clear from their faces: The State places the
name "TEXAS" in large letters at the top of every plate. Moreover, the State
requires Texas vehicle owners to display license plates, and every Texas license
plate is issued by the State. Texas also owns the designs on its license plates,
including the designs that Texas adopts on the basis of proposals made by
private individuals and organizations. And Texas dictates the manner in which
drivers may dispose of unused plates.
Texas license plates are, essentially, government IDs. And issuers of ID
"typically do not permit" the placement on their IDs of "message[s] with which
they do not wish to be associated." Summum. Consequently, "persons who

Robson

559

The First Amendment

observe" designs on IDs "routinely--and reasonably--interpret
conveying some message on the [issuer's] behalf."

them

as

Indeed, a person who displays a message on a Texas license plate likely intends
to convey to the public that the State has endorsed that message. If not, the
individual could simply display the message in question in larger letters on a
bumper sticker right next to the plate. But the individual prefers a license plate
design to the purely private speech expressed through bumper stickers. That
may well be because Texas's license plate designs convey government
agreement with the message displayed.
Third, Texas maintains direct control over the messages conveyed on its
specialty plates. Texas law provides that the State "has sole control over the
design, typeface, color, and alphanumeric pattern for all license plates." The
Board must approve every specialty plate design proposal before the design can
appear on a Texas plate. And the Board and its predecessor have actively
exercised this authority. Texas asserts, and SCV concedes, that the State has
rejected at least a dozen proposed designs. Accordingly, like the city government
in Summum, Texas "has 'effectively controlled' the messages [conveyed] by
exercising 'final approval authority' over their selection." (quoting Johanns).
This final approval authority allows Texas to choose how to present itself and
its constituency. Thus, Texas offers plates celebrating the many educational
institutions attended by its citizens. But it need not issue plates deriding
schooling. Texas offers plates that pay tribute to the Texas citrus industry. But
it need not issue plates praising Florida's oranges as far better. And Texas offers
plates that say "Fight Terrorism." But it need not issue plates promoting al
Qaeda.
These considerations, taken together, convince us that the specialty plates here
in question are similar enough to the monuments in Summum to call for the
same result. That is not to say that every element of our discussion in Summum
is relevant here. For instance, in Summum we emphasized that monuments
were "permanent" and we observed that "public parks can accommodate only a
limited number of permanent monuments." We believed that the speech at
issue was government speech rather than private speech in part because we
found it "hard to imagine how a public park could be opened up for the
installation of permanent monuments by every person or group wishing to
engage in that form of expression." Here, a State could theoretically offer a
much larger number of license plate designs, and those designs need not be
available for time immemorial.
But those characteristics of the speech at issue in Summum were particularly
important because the government speech at issue occurred in public parks,
which are traditional public forums for "the delivery of speeches and the holding
of marches and demonstrations" by private citizens. By contrast, license plates
are not traditional public forums for private speech.
And other features of the designs on Texas's specialty license plates indicate
that the message conveyed by those designs is conveyed on behalf of the
government. Texas, through its Board, selects each design featured on the
State's specialty license plates. Texas presents these designs on governmentmandated, government-controlled, and government-issued IDs that have

Robson

560

The First Amendment

traditionally been used as a medium for government speech. And it places the
designs directly below the large letters identifying "TEXAS" as the issuer of the
IDs. "The [designs] that are accepted, therefore, are meant to convey and have
the effect of conveying a government message, and they thus constitute
government speech."
C
SCV believes that Texas's specialty license plate designs are not government
speech, at least with respect to the designs (comprising slogans and graphics)
that were initially proposed by private parties. According to SCV, the State does
not engage in expressive activity through such slogans and graphics, but rather
provides a forum for private speech by making license plates available to
display the private parties' designs. We cannot agree.
We have previously used what we have called "forum analysis" to evaluate
government restrictions on purely private speech that occurs on government
property. Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc. (1985). But forum
analysis is misplaced here. Because the State is speaking on its own behalf, the
First Amendment strictures that attend the various types of governmentestablished forums do not apply.
The parties agree that Texas's specialty license plates are not a "traditional
public forum," such as a street or a park, "which ha[s] immemorially been held
in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, ha[s] been used for
purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and
discussing public questions." Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.
(1983). ***
It is equally clear that Texas's specialty plates are neither a " 'designated public
forum,' " which exists where "government property that has not traditionally
been regarded as a public forum is intentionally opened up for that purpose,"
nor a "limited public forum," which exists where a government has "reserv[ed a
forum] for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics." A government
"does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,
but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse."
And in order "to ascertain whether [a government] intended to designate a place
not traditionally open to assembly and debate as a public forum," this Court
"has looked to the policy and practice of the government" and to "the nature of
the property and its compatibility with expressive activity."
Texas's policies and the nature of its license plates indicate that the State did
not intend its specialty license plates to serve as either a designated public
forum or a limited public forum. First, the State exercises final authority over
each specialty license plate design. This authority militates against a
determination that Texas has created a public forum. Second, Texas takes
ownership of each specialty plate design, making it particularly untenable that
the State intended specialty plates to serve as a forum for public discourse.
Finally, Texas license plates have traditionally been used for government
speech, are primarily used as a form of government ID, and bear the State's
name. These features of Texas license plates indicate that Texas explicitly
associates itself with the speech on its plates.

Robson

561

The First Amendment

For similar reasons, we conclude that Texas's specialty license plates are not a
"nonpublic for[um]," which exists "[w]here the government is acting as a
proprietor, managing its internal operations." With respect to specialty license
plate designs, Texas is not simply managing government property, but instead
is engaging in expressive conduct. As we have described, we reach this
conclusion based on the historical context, observers' reasonable interpretation
of the messages conveyed by Texas specialty plates, and the effective control
that the State exerts over the design selection process. Texas's specialty license
plate designs "are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a
government message." Summum. They "constitute government speech." Ibid.
The fact that private parties take part in the design and propagation of a
message does not extinguish the governmental nature of the message or
transform the government's role into that of a mere forum-provider. In
Summum, private entities "financed and donated monuments that the
government accept[ed] and display[ed] to the public." Here, similarly, private
parties propose designs that Texas may accept and display on its license plates.
In this case, as in Summum, the "government entity may exercise [its] freedom
to express its views" even "when it receives assistance from private sources for
the purpose of delivering a government-controlled message." And in this case,
as in Summum, forum analysis is inapposite.
Of course, Texas allows many more license plate designs than the city in
Summum allowed monuments. But our holding in Summum was not dependent
on the precise number of monuments found within the park. Indeed, we
indicated that the permanent displays in New York City's Central Park also
constitute government speech. And an amicus brief had informed us that there
were, at the time, 52 such displays. Further, there may well be many more
messages that Texas wishes to convey through its license plates than there
were messages that the city in Summum wished to convey through its
monuments. Texas's desire to communicate numerous messages does not mean
that the messages conveyed are not Texas's own.
Additionally, the fact that Texas vehicle owners pay annual fees in order to
display specialty license plates does not imply that the plate designs are merely
a forum for private speech. While some nonpublic forums provide governments
the opportunity to profit from speech, the existence of government profit alone
is insufficient to trigger forum analysis. Thus, if the city in Summum had
established a rule that organizations wishing to donate monuments must also
pay fees to assist in park maintenance, we do not believe that the result in that
case would have been any different. Here, too, we think it sufficiently clear that
Texas is speaking through its specialty license plate designs, such that the
existence of annual fees does not convince us that the specialty plates are a
nonpublic forum.
Finally, we note that this case does not resemble other cases in which we have
identified a nonpublic forum. This case is not like Perry Ed. Assn., where we
found a school district's internal mail system to be a nonpublic forum for
private speech. There, it was undisputed that a number of private
organizations, including a teachers' union, had access to the mail system. It
was therefore clear that private parties, and not only the government, used the

Robson

562

The First Amendment

system to communicate. Here, by contrast, each specialty license plate design is
formally approved by and stamped with the imprimatur of Texas.
Nor is this case like Lehman [ v. Shaker Heights (1974) (plurality)], where we
found the advertising space on city buses to be a nonpublic forum. There, the
messages were located in a context (advertising space) that is traditionally
available for private speech. And the advertising space, in contrast to license
plates, bore no indicia that the speech was owned or conveyed by the
government.
Nor is this case like Cornelius [v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc. (1985)]
where we determined that a charitable fundraising program directed at federal
employees constituted a nonpublic forum. That forum lacked the kind of history
present here. The fundraising drive had never been a medium for government
speech. Instead, it was established "to bring order to [a] solicitation process"
which had previously consisted of ad hoc solicitation by individual charitable
organizations. The drive "was designed to minimize . . . disruption to the
[federal] workplace," not to communicate messages from the government.
Further, the charitable solicitations did not appear on a government ID under
the government's name. In contrast to the instant case, there was no reason for
employees to "interpret [the solicitation] as conveying some message on the
[government's] behalf." Summum.
IV
Our determination that Texas's specialty license plate designs are government
speech does not mean that the designs do not also implicate the free speech
rights of private persons. We have acknowledged that drivers who display a
State's selected license plate designs convey the messages communicated
through those designs. See Wooley v. Maynard (1977) (observing that a vehicle
"is readily associated with its operator" and that drivers displaying license
plates "use their private property as a 'mobile billboard' for the State's
ideological message"). And we have recognized that the First Amendment
stringently limits a State's authority to compel a private party to express a view
with which the private party disagrees. Wooley; Hurley v. Irish-American Gay,
Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc. (1995); West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v.
Barnette (1943). But here, compelled private speech is not at issue. And just as
Texas cannot require SCV to convey "the State's ideological message," Wooley,
SCV cannot force Texas to include a Confederate battle flag on its specialty
license plates.

*

*

*

For the reasons stated, we hold that Texas's specialty license plate designs
constitute government speech and that Texas was consequently entitled to
refuse to issue plates featuring SCV's proposed design. Accordingly, the
judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is
Reversed.

Robson

563

The First Amendment

JUSTICE ALITO, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, AND JUSTICE
KENNEDY JOIN, DISSENTING.
The Court's decision passes off private speech as government speech and, in
doing so, establishes a precedent that threatens private speech that government
finds displeasing. Under our First Amendment cases, the distinction between
government speech and private speech is critical. The First Amendment "does
not regulate government speech," and therefore when government speaks, it is
free "to select the views that it wants to express." Pleasant Grove City v.
Summum (2009). By contrast, "[i]n the realm of private speech or expression,
government regulation may not favor one speaker over another." Rosenberger v.
Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995).
Unfortunately, the Court's decision categorizes private speech as government
speech and thus strips it of all First Amendment protection. The Court holds
that all the privately created messages on the many specialty plates issued by
the State of Texas convey a government message rather than the message of the
motorist displaying the plate. Can this possibly be correct?
Here is a test. Suppose you sat by the side of a Texas highway and studied the
license plates on the vehicles passing by. You would see, in addition to the
standard Texas plates, an impressive array of specialty plates. (There are now
more than 350 varieties.) You would likely observe plates that honor numerous
colleges and universities. You might see plates bearing the name of a high
school, a fraternity or sorority, the Masons, the Knights of Columbus, the
Daughters of the American Revolution, a realty company, a favorite soft drink, a
favorite burger restaurant, and a favorite NASCAR driver.
As you sat there watching these plates speed by, would you really think that the
sentiments reflected in these specialty plates are the views of the State of Texas
and not those of the owners of the cars? If a car with a plate that says "Rather
Be Golfing" passed by at 8:30 am on a Monday morning, would you think: "This
is the official policy of the State--better to golf than to work?" If you did your
viewing at the start of the college football season and you saw Texas plates with
the names of the University of Texas's out-of-state competitors in upcoming
games--Notre Dame, Oklahoma State, the University of Oklahoma, Kansas
State, Iowa State--would you assume that the State of Texas was officially (and
perhaps treasonously) rooting for the Longhorns' opponents? And when a car
zipped by with a plate that reads "NASCAR - 24 Jeff Gordon," would you think
that Gordon (born in California, raised in Indiana, resides in North Carolina) is
the official favorite of the State government?
The Court says that all of these messages are government speech. It is essential
that government be able to express its own viewpoint, the Court reminds us,
because otherwise, how would it promote its programs, like recycling and
vaccinations? So when Texas issues a "Rather Be Golfing" plate, but not a
"Rather Be Playing Tennis" or "Rather Be Bowling" plate, it is furthering a state
policy to promote golf but not tennis or bowling. And when Texas allows
motorists to obtain a Notre Dame license plate but not a University of Southern
California plate, it is taking sides in that long-time rivalry.
This capacious understanding of government speech takes a large and painful
bite out of the First Amendment. Specialty plates may seem innocuous. They

Robson

564

The First Amendment

make motorists happy, and they put money in a State's coffers. But the
precedent this case sets is dangerous. While all license plates unquestionably
contain some government speech (e.g., the name of the State and the numbers
and/or letters identifying the vehicle), the State of Texas has converted the
remaining space on its specialty plates into little mobile billboards on which
motorists can display their own messages. And what Texas did here was to
reject one of the messages that members of a private group wanted to post on
some of these little billboards because the State thought that many of its
citizens would find the message offensive. That is blatant viewpoint
discrimination.
If the State can do this with its little mobile billboards, could it do the same
with big, stationary billboards? Suppose that a State erected electronic
billboards along its highways. Suppose that the State posted some government
messages on these billboards and then, to raise money, allowed private entities
and individuals to purchase the right to post their own messages. And suppose
that the State allowed only those messages that it liked or found not too
controversial. Would that be constitutional?
What if a state college or university did the same thing with a similar billboard

messages that are consistent with prevailing views on campus but banned
those that disturbed some students or faculty? Can there be any doubt that
these examples of viewpoint discrimination would violate the First Amendment?
I hope not, but the future uses of today's precedent remain to be seen.***

The Texas Division of Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) is an organization
composed of descendants of Confederate soldiers. The group applied for a Texas
specialty license plate in 2009 and again in 2010. Their proposed design
featured a controversial symbol, the Confederate battle flag, surrounded by the
words "Sons of Confederate Veterans 1896" and a gold border. The Texas
Department of Motor Vehicles Board (or Board) invited public comments and
considered the plate design at a meeting in April 2011. At that meeting, one
board member was absent, and the remaining eight members deadlocked on
whether to approve the plate. The Board thus reconsidered the plate at its
meeting in November 2011. This time, many opponents of the plate turned out
to voice objections. The Board then voted unanimously against approval and
issued an order stating:
"The Board has considered the information and finds it necessary to deny this
plate design application, specifically the confederate flag portion of the design,
because public comments have shown that many members of the general
public find the design offensive, and because such comments are reasonable.
The Board finds that a significant portion of the public associate the
confederate flag with organizations advocating expressions of hate directed
toward people or groups that is demeaning to those people or groups."
The Board also saw "a compelling public interest in protecting a conspicuous
mechanism for identification, such as a license plate, from degrading into a

Robson

565

The First Amendment

possible public safety issue." And it thought that the public interest required
rejection of the plate design because the controversy surrounding the plate was
so great that "the design could distract or disturb some drivers to the point of
being unreasonably dangerous."
At the same meeting, the Board approved a Buffalo Soldiers plate design by a 5to-3 vote. Proceeds from fees paid by motorists who select that plate benefit the
Buffalo Soldier National Museum in Houston, which is "dedicated primarily to
preserving the legacy and honor of the African American soldier." Buffalo
Soldier National Museum, online at http://www.buffalosoldiermuseum.com.
"Buffalo Soldiers" is a nickname that was originally given to black soldiers in
the Army's 10th Cavalry Regiment, which was formed after the Civil War, and
the name was later used to describe other black soldiers. The original Buffalo
Soldiers fought with distinction in the Indian Wars, but the "Buffalo Soldiers"
plate was opposed by some Native Americans. One leader commented that he
felt " 'the same way about the Buffalo Soldiers' " as African-Americans felt about
the Confederate flag. “'When we see the U. S. Cavalry uniform,' " he explained, "
'we are forced to relive an American holocaust.' "

What Texas has done by selling space on its license plates is to create what we
have called a limited public forum. It has allowed state property (i.e., motor
vehicle license plates) to be used by private speakers according to rules that the
State prescribes. Under the First Amendment, however, those rules cannot
discriminate on the basis of viewpoint. See Rosenberger. But that is exactly
what Texas did here. The Board rejected Texas SCV's design, "specifically the
confederate flag portion of the design, because public comments have shown
that many members of the general public find the design offensive, and because
such comments are reasonable." These statements indisputably demonstrate
that the Board denied Texas SCV's design because of its viewpoint.
The Confederate battle flag is a controversial symbol. To the Texas Sons of
Confederate Veterans, it is said to evoke the memory of their ancestors and
other soldiers who fought for the South in the Civil War. To others, it
symbolizes slavery, segregation, and hatred. Whatever it means to motorists
who display that symbol and to those who see it, the flag expresses a viewpoint.
The Board rejected the plate design because it concluded that many Texans
would find the flag symbol offensive. That was pure viewpoint discrimination.
If the Board's candid explanation of its reason for rejecting the SCV plate were
not alone sufficient to establish this point, the Board's approval of the Buffalo
Soldiers plate at the same meeting dispels any doubt. The proponents of both
the SCV and Buffalo Soldiers plates saw them as honoring soldiers who served
with bravery and honor in the past. To the opponents of both plates, the images
on the plates evoked painful memories. The Board rejected one plate and
approved the other.
Like these two plates, many other specialty plates have the potential to irritate
and perhaps even infuriate those who see them. Texas allows a plate with the
words "Choose Life," but the State of New York rejected such a plate because

Robson

566

The First Amendment

the message " '[is] so incredibly divisive,' " and the Second Circuit recently
sustained that decision. Children First Foundation, Inc. v. Fiala (2015). Texas
allows a specialty plate honoring the Boy Scouts, but the group's refusal to
accept gay leaders angers some. Virginia, another State with a proliferation of
specialty plates, issues plates for controversial organizations like the National
Rifle Association, controversial commercial enterprises (raising tobacco and
mining coal), controversial sports (fox hunting), and a professional sports team
with a controversial name (the Washington Redskins). Allowing States to reject
specialty plates based on their potential to offend is viewpoint discrimination.
The Board's decision cannot be saved by its suggestion that the plate, if
allowed, "could distract or disturb some drivers to the point of being
unreasonably dangerous." This rationale cannot withstand strict scrutiny.
Other States allow specialty plates with the Confederate Battle Flag, and Texas
has not pointed to evidence that these plates have led to incidents of road rage
or accidents. Texas does not ban bumper stickers bearing the image of the
Confederate battle flag. Nor does it ban any of the many other bumper stickers
that convey political messages and other messages that are capable of exciting
the ire of those who loathe the ideas they express.
Messages that are proposed by private parties and placed on Texas specialty
plates are private speech, not government speech. Texas cannot forbid private
speech based on its viewpoint. That is what it did here. Because the Court
approves this violation of the First Amendment, I respectfully dissent.

Notes	  
1.
Note that the consequence of a finding of “government speech”
removes the subject from First Amendment analysis.

Consider Justice Thomas’s position in the majority of the 5-4

How would you explain the difference between a forum opened by
the government for “private speech” and a “forum” that is government

The Court announced its decision in Walker on the morning of
June 18, 2015. The previous evening, a white male about 21 years of
age entered an historically black church, Emanuel African Methodist
Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston, South Carolina, participated
in a Bible study session, and then opened fire with a handgun, killing
nine people, including a state senator. Images of the alleged perpetrator,
Dylann Roof, were later publicized including one in which he posed with
a car bearing a Confederate battle flag license plate and another in which
he brandished a gun in front of a Confederate flag. On July 9, 2015, the
state Governor signed legislation removing the Confederate flag from the
state capitol grounds, where it had been displayed since 1962, although
relocated in 2000.

357 U.S. 449 (1958)

JUSTICE HARLAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE UNANIMOUS COURT.
We review from the standpoint of its validity under the Federal Constitution a
judgment of civil contempt entered against petitioner, the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People [NAACP] in the courts of Alabama. The
question presented is whether Alabama, consistently with the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, can compel petitioner to reveal to the
State's Attorney General the names and addresses of all its Alabama members
and agents, without regard to their positions or functions in the Association.
The judgment of contempt was based upon petitioner's refusal to comply fully
with a court order requiring in part the production of membership lists.
Petitioner's claim is that the order, in the circumstances shown by this record,
violated rights assured to petitioner and its members under the Constitution.
Alabama has a statute similar to those of many other States which requires a
foreign corporation, except as exempted, to qualify before doing business by
filing its corporate charter with the Secretary of State and designating a place of
business and an agent to receive service of process. The statute imposes a fine
on a corporation transacting intrastate business before qualifying and provides
for criminal prosecution of officers of such a corporation. Ala. Code, 1940, Tit.
10, 192-198. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is
a nonprofit membership corporation organized under the laws of New York. Its
purposes, fostered on a nationwide basis, are those indicated by its name,† and
it operates through chartered affiliates which are independent unincorporated
associations, with membership therein equivalent to membership in petitioner.
The first Alabama affiliates were chartered in 1918. Since that time the aims of
the Association have been advanced through activities of its affiliates, and in
1951 the Association itself opened a regional office in Alabama, at which it
employed two supervisory persons and one clerical worker. The Association has
never complied with the qualification statute, from which it considered itself
exempt.
In 1956 the Attorney General of Alabama brought an equity suit in the State
Circuit Court, Montgomery County, to enjoin the Association from conducting
further activities within, and to oust it from, the State. Among other things the
bill in equity alleged that the Association had opened a regional office and had
†

	  The Certificate of Incorporation of the Association provides that its ". . . principal objects . . . are voluntarily
to promote equality of rights and eradicate caste or race prejudice among the citizens of the United States; to
advance the interest of colored citizens; to secure for them impartial suffrage; and to increase their
opportunities for securing justice in the courts, education for their children, employment according to their
ability, and complete equality before the law.”

The First Amendment

organized various affiliates in Alabama; had recruited members and solicited
contributions within the State; had given financial support and furnished legal
assistance to Negro students seeking admission to the state university; and had
supported a Negro boycott of the bus lines in Montgomery to compel the seating
of passengers without regard to race. The bill recited that the Association, by
continuing to do business in Alabama without complying with the qualification
statute, was ". . . causing irreparable injury to the property and civil rights of
the residents and citizens of the State of Alabama for which criminal
prosecution and civil actions at law afford no adequate relief . . . ." On the day
the complaint was filed, the Circuit Court issued ex parte an order restraining
the Association, pendente lite, from engaging in further activities within the
State and forbidding it to take any steps to qualify itself to do business therein.
Petitioner demurred to the allegations of the bill and moved to dissolve the
restraining order. It contended that its activities did not subject it to the
qualification requirements of the statute and that in any event what the State
sought to accomplish by its suit would violate rights to freedom of speech and
assembly guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States. Before the date set for a hearing on this motion, the State
moved for the production of a large number of the Association's records and
papers, including bank statements, leases, deeds, and records containing the
names and addresses of all Alabama "members" and "agents" of the Association.
It alleged that all such documents were necessary for adequate preparation for
the hearing, in view of petitioner's denial of the conduct of intrastate business
within the meaning of the qualification statute. Over petitioner's objections, the
court ordered the production of a substantial part of the requested records,
including the membership lists, and postponed the hearing on the restraining
order to a date later than the time ordered for production.
Thereafter petitioner filed its answer to the bill in equity. It admitted its
Alabama activities substantially as alleged in the complaint and that it had not
qualified to do business in the State. Although still disclaiming the statute's
application to it, petitioner offered to qualify if the bar from qualification made
part of the restraining order were lifted, and it submitted with the answer an
executed set of the forms required by the statute. However petitioner did not
comply with the production order, and for this failure was adjudged in civil
contempt and fined $10,000. The contempt judgment provided that the fine
would be subject to reduction or remission if compliance were forthcoming
within five days but otherwise would be increased to $100,000.
At the end of the five-day period petitioner produced substantially all the data
called for by the production order except its membership lists, as to which it
contended that Alabama could not constitutionally compel disclosure, and
moved to modify or vacate the contempt judgment, or stay its execution pending
appellate review. This motion was denied. While a similar stay application,
which was later denied, was pending before the Supreme Court of Alabama, the
Circuit Court made a further order adjudging petitioner in continuing contempt
and increasing the fine already imposed to $100,000. Under Alabama law the
effect of the contempt adjudication was to foreclose petitioner from obtaining a
hearing on the merits of the underlying ouster action, or from taking any steps

Robson

570

The First Amendment

to dissolve the temporary restraining order which had been issued ex parte,
until it purged itself of contempt.
The State Supreme Court thereafter twice dismissed petitions for certiorari to
review this final contempt judgment, the first time for insufficiency of the
petition's allegations and the second time on procedural grounds. We granted
certiorari because of the importance of the constitutional questions presented.
I.
We address ourselves first to respondent's contention that we lack jurisdiction
because the denial of certiorari by the Supreme Court of Alabama rests on an
independent nonfederal ground, namely, that petitioner in applying for
certiorari had pursued the wrong appellate remedy under state law. ***
We hold that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain petitioner's federal claims.
II.
The Association both urges that it is constitutionally entitled to resist official
inquiry into its membership lists, and that it may assert, on behalf of its
members, a right personal to them to be protected from compelled disclosure by
the State of their affiliation with the Association as revealed by the membership
lists. We think that petitioner argues more appropriately the rights of its
members, and that its nexus with them is sufficient to permit that it act as
their representative before this Court. In so concluding, we reject respondent's
argument that the Association lacks standing to assert here constitutional
rights pertaining to the members, who are not of course parties to the litigation.
***
III.
We thus reach petitioner's claim that the production order in the state litigation
trespasses upon fundamental freedoms protected by the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioner argues that in view of the facts and
circumstances shown in the record, the effect of compelled disclosure of the
membership lists will be to abridge the rights of its rank-and-file members to
engage in lawful association in support of their common beliefs. It contends
that governmental action which, although not directly suppressing association,
nevertheless carries this consequence, can be justified only upon some
overriding valid interest of the State.
Effective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly
controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association, as this Court
has more than once recognized by remarking upon the close nexus between the
freedoms of speech and assembly. It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in
association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of
the "liberty" assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
which embraces freedom of speech. See Gitlow v. New York (1925); Palko v.
Connecticut (1937); Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940); Staub v. City of Baxley (1958).
Of course, it is immaterial whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by
association pertain to political, economic, religious or cultural matters, and
state action which may have the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is
subject to the closest scrutiny.
The fact that Alabama, so far as is relevant to the validity of the contempt
judgment presently under review, has taken no direct action to restrict the right

Robson

571

The First Amendment

of petitioner's members to associate freely, does not end inquiry into the effect
of the production order. In the domain of these indispensable liberties, whether
of speech, press, or association, the decisions of this Court recognize that
abridgment of such rights, even though unintended, may inevitably follow from
varied forms of governmental action. *** The governmental action challenged
may appear to be totally unrelated to protected liberties. Statutes imposing
taxes upon rather than prohibiting particular activity have been struck down
when perceived to have the consequence of unduly curtailing the liberty of
freedom of press assured under the Fourteenth Amendment. Grosjean v.
American Press Co. (1936); Murdock v. Pennsylvania (1943).
It is hardly a novel perception that compelled disclosure of affiliation with
groups engaged in advocacy may constitute as effective a restraint on freedom
of association as the forms of governmental action in the cases above were
thought likely to produce upon the particular constitutional rights there
involved. This Court has recognized the vital relationship between freedom to
associate and privacy in one's associations. When referring to the varied forms
of governmental action which might interfere with freedom of assembly, it said
in American Communications Assn. v. Douds (1950), "A requirement that
adherents of particular religious faiths or political parties wear identifying armbands, for example, is obviously of this nature." Compelled disclosure of
membership in an organization engaged in advocacy of particular beliefs is of
the same order. Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many
circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association,
particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.
We think that the production order, in the respects here drawn in question,
must be regarded as entailing the likelihood of a substantial restraint upon the
exercise by petitioner's members of their right to freedom of association.
Petitioner has made an uncontroverted showing that on past occasions
revelation of the identity of its rank-and-file members has exposed these
members to economic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion,
and other manifestations of public hostility. Under these circumstances, we
think it apparent that compelled disclosure of petitioner's Alabama membership
is likely to affect adversely the ability of petitioner and its members to pursue
their collective effort to foster beliefs which they admittedly have the right to
advocate, in that it may induce members to withdraw from the Association and
dissuade others from joining it because of fear of exposure of their beliefs
shown through their associations and of the consequences of this exposure.
It is not sufficient to answer, as the State does here, that whatever repressive
effect compulsory disclosure of names of petitioner's members may have upon
participation by Alabama citizens in petitioner's activities follows not from state
action but from private community pressures. The crucial factor is the interplay
of governmental and private action, for it is only after the initial exertion of state
power represented by the production order that private action takes hold.
We turn to the final question whether Alabama has demonstrated an interest in
obtaining the disclosures it seeks from petitioner which is sufficient to justify
the deterrent effect which we have concluded these disclosures may well have
on the free exercise by petitioner's members of their constitutionally protected
right of association. Such a ". . . subordinating interest of the State must be

Robson

572

The First Amendment

compelling," It is not of moment that the State has here acted solely through its
judicial branch, for whether legislative or judicial, it is still the application of
state power which we are asked to scrutinize.
It is important to bear in mind that petitioner asserts no right to absolute
immunity from state investigation, and no right to disregard Alabama's laws. As
shown by its substantial compliance with the production order, petitioner does
not deny Alabama's right to obtain from it such information as the State desires
concerning the purposes of the Association and its activities within the State.
Petitioner has not objected to divulging the identity of its members who are
employed by or hold official positions with it. It has urged the rights solely of its
ordinary rank-and-file members. This is therefore not analogous to a case
involving the interest of a State in protecting its citizens in their dealings with
paid solicitors or agents of foreign corporations by requiring identification.
Whether there was "justification" in this instance turns solely on the
substantiality of Alabama's interest in obtaining the membership lists. During
the course of a hearing before the Alabama Circuit Court on a motion of
petitioner to set aside the production order, the State Attorney General
presented at length, under examination by petitioner, the State's reason for
requesting the membership lists. The exclusive purpose was to determine
whether petitioner was conducting intrastate business in violation of the
Alabama foreign corporation registration statute, and the membership lists
were expected to help resolve this question. The issues in the litigation
commenced by Alabama by its bill in equity were whether the character of
petitioner and its activities in Alabama had been such as to make petitioner
subject to the registration statute, and whether the extent of petitioner's
activities without qualifying suggested its permanent ouster from the State.
Without intimating the slightest view upon the merits of these issues, we are
unable to perceive that the disclosure of the names of petitioner's rank-and-file
members has a substantial bearing on either of them. As matters stand in the
state court, petitioner (1) has admitted its presence and conduct of activities in
Alabama since 1918; (2) has offered to comply in all respects with the state
qualification statute, although preserving its contention that the statute does
not apply to it; and (3) has apparently complied satisfactorily with the
production order, except for the membership lists, by furnishing the Attorney
General with varied business records, its charter and statement of purposes,
the names of all of its directors and officers, and with the total number of its
Alabama members and the amount of their dues. These last items would not on
this record appear subject to constitutional challenge and have been furnished,
but whatever interest the State may have in obtaining names of ordinary
members has not been shown to be sufficient to overcome petitioner's
constitutional objections to the production order.
From what has already been said, we think it apparent that Bryant v.
Zimmerman (1928) cannot be relied on in support of the State's position, for
that case involved markedly different considerations in terms of the interest of
the State in obtaining disclosure. There, this Court upheld, as applied to a
member of a local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, a New York statute requiring
any unincorporated association which demanded an oath as a condition to
membership to file with state officials copies of its ". . . constitution, by-laws,

Robson

573

The First Amendment

rules, regulations and oath of membership, together with a roster of its
membership and a list of its officers for the current year." N. Y. Laws 1923, c.
664, 53, 56. In its opinion, the Court took care to emphasize the nature of the
organization which New York sought to regulate. The decision was based on the
particular character of the Klan's activities, involving acts of unlawful
intimidation and violence, which the Court assumed was before the state
legislature when it enacted the statute, and of which the Court itself took
judicial notice. Furthermore, the situation before us is significantly different
from that in Bryant, because the organization there had made no effort to
comply with any of the requirements of New York's statute but rather had
refused to furnish the State with any information as to its local activities.
We hold that the immunity from state scrutiny of membership lists which the
Association claims on behalf of its members is here so related to the right of the
members to pursue their lawful private interests privately and to associate
freely with others in so doing as to come within the protection of the Fourteenth
Amendment. And we conclude that Alabama has fallen short of showing a
controlling justification for the deterrent effect on the free enjoyment of the right
to associate which disclosure of membership lists is likely to have. Accordingly,
the judgment of civil contempt and the $100,000 fine which resulted from
petitioner's refusal to comply with the production order in this respect must fall.
IV.
Petitioner joins with its attack upon the production order a challenge to the
constitutionality of the State's ex parte temporary restraining order preventing
it from soliciting support in Alabama, and it asserts that the Fourteenth
Amendment precludes such state action. But as noted above, petitioner has
never received a hearing on the merits of the ouster suit, and we do not
consider these questions properly here. ***Only from the disposition of such an
appeal can review be sought here.
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama must be
reversed and the case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.
Reversed.

I
On April 27, 1988, Margaret McIntyre distributed leaflets to persons attending a
public meeting at the Blendon Middle School in Westerville, Ohio. At this
meeting, the superintendent of schools planned to discuss an imminent
referendum on a proposed school tax levy. The leaflets expressed Mrs.
McIntyre's opposition to the levy.‡ There is no suggestion that the text of her
message was false, misleading, or libelous. She had composed and printed it on
her home computer and had paid a professional printer to make additional
copies. Some of the handbills identified her as the author; others merely
purported to express the views of "CONCERNED PARENTS AND TAX PAYERS."
Except for the help provided by her son and a friend, who placed some of the
leaflets on car windshields in the school parking lot, Mrs. McIntyre acted
independently.
While Mrs. McIntyre distributed her handbills, an official of the school district,
who supported the tax proposal, advised her that the unsigned leaflets did not
conform to the Ohio election laws. Undeterred, Mrs. McIntyre appeared at
another meeting on the next evening and handed out more of the handbills.
The proposed school levy was defeated at the next two elections, but it finally
passed on its third try in November 1988. Five months later, the same school
official filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission charging that Mrs.
McIntyre's distribution of unsigned leaflets violated 3599.09(A) of the Ohio Code
[prohibiting participation in publications “designed to promote the nomination
or election or defeat of a candidate, or to promote the adoption or defeat of any

statement the name and residence or business address of the chairman,
treasurer, or secretary of the organization issuing the same, or the person who
issues, makes, or is responsible therefor.” ] The Commission agreed and
imposed a fine of $100.
The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas reversed. Finding that Mrs.
McIntyre did not "mislead the public nor act in a surreptitious manner," the
court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to her conduct.
The Ohio Court of Appeals, by a divided vote, reinstated the fine.
Notwithstanding doubts about the continuing validity of a 1922 decision of the
Ohio Supreme Court upholding the statutory predecessor of §3599.09(A), the
majority considered itself bound by that precedent. The dissenting judge
thought that our intervening decision in Talley v. California (1960), in which we
invalidated a city ordinance prohibiting all anonymous leafletting, compelled
the Ohio court to adopt a narrowing construction of the statute to save its
constitutionality.
The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed by a divided vote. The majority distinguished
Mrs. McIntyre's case from Talley on the ground that §3599.09(A) "has as its
purpose the identification of persons who distribute materials containing false
statements." The Ohio court believed that such a law should be upheld if the
burdens imposed on the First Amendment rights of voters are "reasonable" and
"nondiscriminatory." Under that standard, the majority concluded that the
statute was plainly valid.***
Mrs. McIntyre passed away during the pendency of this litigation. Even though
the amount in controversy is only $100, petitioner, as the executor of her estate,
has pursued her claim in this Court. Our grant of certiorari reflects our
agreement with his appraisal of the importance of the question presented.
II
Ohio maintains that the statute under review is a reasonable regulation of the
electoral process. The State does not suggest that all anonymous publications
are pernicious or that a statute totally excluding them from the marketplace of
ideas would be valid. This is a wise (albeit implicit) concession, for the
anonymity of an author is not ordinarily a sufficient reason to exclude her work
product from the protections of the First Amendment.

The First Amendment

identifying the creator of a work of art, an author generally is free to decide
whether or not to disclose her true identity. The decision in favor of anonymity
may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation, by concern about
social ostracism, or merely by a desire to preserve as much of one's privacy as
possible. Whatever the motivation may be, at least in the field of literary
endeavor, the interest in having anonymous works enter the marketplace of
ideas unquestionably outweighs any public interest in requiring disclosure as a
condition of entry. Accordingly, an author's decision to remain anonymous, like
other decisions concerning omissions or additions to the content of a
publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First
Amendment.
The freedom to publish anonymously extends beyond the literary realm. In
Talley, the Court held that the First Amendment protects the distribution of
unsigned handbills urging readers to boycott certain Los Angeles merchants
who were allegedly engaging in discriminatory employment practices. Writing
for the Court, Justice Black noted that "[p]ersecuted groups and sects from time
to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and
laws either anonymously or not at all." Justice Black recalled England's abusive
press licensing laws and seditious libel prosecutions, and he reminded us that
even the arguments favoring the ratification of the Constitution advanced in the
Federalist Papers were published under fictitious names. On occasion, quite
apart from any threat of persecution, an advocate may believe her ideas will be
more persuasive if her readers are unaware of her identity. Anonymity thereby
provides a way for a writer who may be personally unpopular to ensure that
readers will not prejudge her message simply because they do not like its
proponent. Thus, even in the field of political rhetoric, where "the identity of the
speaker is an important component of many attempts to persuade," City of
Ladue v. Gilleo (1994) the most effective advocates have sometimes opted for
anonymity. The specific holding in Talley related to advocacy of an economic
boycott, but the Court's reasoning embraced a respected tradition of anonymity
in the advocacy of political causes. ** This tradition is perhaps best exemplified
by the secret ballot, the hard-won right to vote one's conscience without fear of
retaliation.
III
California had defended the Los Angeles ordinance at issue in Talley as a law
1991) (adhering to the traditional view that Shaksper was in fact the author). See also Stevens, The
Shakespeare Canon of Statutory Construction, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1373 (1992) (commenting on the competing
theories).

	  

**

	  [Footnote 6] That tradition is most famously embodied in the Federalist Papers, authored by James
Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, but signed "Publius." Publius's opponents, the Anti-Federalists,
also tended to publish under pseudonyms: prominent among them were "Cato," believed to be New York
Governor George Clinton; "Centinel," probably Samuel Bryan or his father, Pennsylvania judge and legislator
George Bryan; "The Federal Farmer," who may have been Richard Henry Lee, a Virginia member of the
Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence; and "Brutus," who may have been
Robert Yates, a New York Supreme Court justice who walked out on the Constitutional Convention. 2 H.
Storing, ed., The Complete Anti-Federalist (1981). A forerunner of all of these writers was the preRevolutionary War English pamphleteer "Junius," whose true identity remains a mystery. See J. M. Faragher,
ed., The Encyclopedia of Colonial and Revolutionary America 220 (1990) (positing that "Junius" may have
been Sir Phillip Francis). The "Letters of Junius" were "widely reprinted in colonial newspapers and lent
considerable support to the revolutionary cause." Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 531 , n. 60 (1969).

The First Amendment

"aimed at providing a way to identify those responsible for fraud, false
advertising and libel." We rejected that argument because nothing in the text or
legislative history of the ordinance limited its application to those evils. We then
made clear that we did "not pass on the validity of an ordinance limited to
prevent these or any other supposed evils." The Ohio statute likewise contains
no language limiting its application to fraudulent, false, or libelous statements;
to the extent, therefore, that Ohio seeks to justify 3599.09(A) as a means to
prevent the dissemination of untruths, its defense must fail for the same reason
given in Talley. As the facts of this case demonstrate, the ordinance plainly
applies even when there is no hint of falsity or libel.
Ohio's statute does, however, contain a different limitation: It applies only to
unsigned documents designed to influence voters in an election. In contrast,
the Los Angeles ordinance prohibited all anonymous handbilling "in any place
under any circumstances." For that reason, Ohio correctly argues that Talley
does not necessarily control the disposition of this case. We must, therefore,
decide whether and to what extent the First Amendment's protection of
anonymity encompasses documents intended to influence the electoral process.
Ohio places its principal reliance on cases such as Anderson v. Celebrezze
(1983) [filing deadlines]; Storer v. Brown (1974) [ballot access]; and Burdick v.
Takushi (1992) [write-in voting], in which we reviewed election code provisions
governing the voting process itself. In those cases we refused to adopt "any
`litmus-paper test' that will separate valid from invalid restrictions." Instead, we
pursued an analytical process comparable to that used by courts "in ordinary
litigation": we considered the relative interests of the State and the injured
voters, and we evaluated the extent to which the State's interests necessitated
the contested restrictions. Applying similar reasoning in this case, the Ohio
Supreme Court upheld §3599.09(A) as a "reasonable" and "nondiscriminatory"
burden on the rights of voters.
The "ordinary litigation" test does not apply here. Unlike the statutory
provisions challenged in Storer and Anderson, §3599.09(A) of the Ohio Code
does not control the mechanics of the electoral process. It is a regulation of
pure speech. Moreover, even though this provision applies evenhandedly to
advocates of differing viewpoints, it is a direct regulation of the content of
speech. Every written document covered by the statute must contain "the name
and residence or business address of the chairman, treasurer, or secretary of
the organization issuing the same, or the person who issues, makes, or is
responsible therefor." Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §3599.09(A) (1988). Furthermore,
the category of covered documents is defined by their content - only those
publications containing speech designed to influence the voters in an election
need bear the required markings. Consequently, we are not faced with an
ordinary election restriction; this case "involves a limitation on political
expression subject to exacting scrutiny." Meyer v. Grant (1988).
Indeed, as we have explained on many prior occasions, the category of speech
regulated by the Ohio statute occupies the core of the protection afforded by the
First Amendment. ***[extensive quotation from Buckley v. Valeo (1976)].
Of course, core political speech need not center on a candidate for office. The
principles enunciated in Buckley [v. Valeo] extend equally to issue-based

Robson

578

The First Amendment

elections such as the school-tax referendum that Mrs. McIntyre sought to
influence through her handbills. Indeed, the speech in which Mrs. McIntyre
engaged - handing out leaflets in the advocacy of a politically controversial
viewpoint - is the essence of First Amendment expression. That this advocacy
occurred in the heat of a controversial referendum vote only strengthens the
protection afforded to Ms. McIntyre's expression: urgent, important, and
effective speech can be no less protected than impotent speech, lest the right to
speak be relegated to those instances when it is least needed. No form of speech
is entitled to greater constitutional protection than Mrs. McIntyre's.
When a law burdens core political speech, we apply "exacting scrutiny," and we
uphold the restriction only if it is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state
interest. Our precedents thus make abundantly clear that the Ohio Supreme
Court applied a significantly more lenient standard than is appropriate in a
case of this kind.
IV
Nevertheless, the State argues that even under the strictest standard of review,
the disclosure requirement in 3599.09(A) is justified by two important and
legitimate state interests. Ohio judges its interest in preventing fraudulent and
libelous statements and its interest in providing the electorate with relevant
information to be sufficiently compelling to justify the anonymous speech ban.
These two interests necessarily overlap to some extent, but it is useful to
discuss them separately.
Insofar as the interest in informing the electorate means nothing more than the
provision of additional information that may either buttress or undermine the
argument in a document, we think the identity of the speaker is no different
from other components of the document's content that the author is free to
include or exclude. We have already held that the State may not compel a
newspaper that prints editorials critical of a particular candidate to provide
space for a reply by the candidate. Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974).
The simple interest in providing voters with additional relevant information does
not justify a state requirement that a writer make statements or disclosures she
would otherwise omit. Moreover, in the case of a handbill written by a private
citizen who is not known to the recipient, the name and address of the author
adds little, if anything, to the reader's ability to evaluate the document's
message. Thus, Ohio's informational interest is plainly insufficient to support
the constitutionality of its disclosure requirement.
The state interest in preventing fraud and libel stands on a different footing. We
agree with Ohio's submission that this interest carries special weight during
election campaigns when false statements, if credited, may have serious adverse
consequences for the public at large. Ohio does not, however, rely solely on
3599.09(A) to protect that interest. Its Election Code includes detailed and
specific prohibitions against making or disseminating false statements during
political campaigns. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 3599.09.1(B), 3599.09.2(B) (1988).
These regulations apply both to candidate elections and to issue-driven ballot
measures. Thus, Ohio's prohibition of anonymous leaflets plainly is not its
principal weapon against fraud. Rather, it serves as an aid to enforcement of
the specific prohibitions and as a deterrent to the making of false statements by
unscrupulous prevaricators. Although these ancillary benefits are assuredly

Robson

579

The First Amendment

legitimate, we are not persuaded that they justify 3599.09(A)'s extremely broad
prohibition.
As this case demonstrates, the prohibition encompasses documents that are
not even arguably false or misleading. It applies not only to the activities of
candidates and their organized supporters, but also to individuals acting
independently and using only their own modest resources. It applies not only to
elections of officers, but also to ballot issues that present neither a substantial
risk of libel nor any potential appearance of corrupt advantage. It applies not
only to leaflets distributed on the eve of an election, when the opportunity for
reply is limited, but also to those distributed months in advance. It applies no
matter what the character or strength of the author's interest in anonymity.
Moreover, as this case also demonstrates, the absence of the author's name on
a document does not necessarily protect either that person or a distributor of a
forbidden document from being held responsible for compliance with the
election code. Nor has the State explained why it can more easily enforce the
direct bans on disseminating false documents against anonymous authors and
distributors than against wrongdoers who might use false names and addresses
in an attempt to avoid detection. We recognize that a State's enforcement
interest might justify a more limited identification requirement, but Ohio has
shown scant cause for inhibiting the leafletting at issue here.
V
Finally, Ohio vigorously argues that our opinions in First Nat. Bank of Boston v.
Bellotti (1978) and Buckley v. Valeo (1976) amply support the constitutionality
of its disclosure requirement. Neither case is controlling: the former concerned
the scope of First Amendment protection afforded to corporations; the relevant
portion of the latter concerned mandatory disclosure of campaign-related
expenditures. Neither case involved a prohibition of anonymous campaign
literature. ***
VI
Under our Constitution, anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious,
fraudulent practice, but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent.
Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. See generally J. S. MILL,
ON LIBERTY, in ON LIBERTY AND CONSIDERATIONS ON REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT
1, 3-4 (R. McCallum ed. 1947). It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill
of Rights, and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular
individuals from retaliation - and their ideas from suppression - at the hand of
an intolerant society. The right to remain anonymous may be abused when it
shields fraudulent conduct. But political speech by its nature will sometimes
have unpalatable consequences, and, in general, our society accords greater
weight to the value of free speech than to the dangers of its misuse. See Abrams
v. United States (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting). Ohio has not shown that its
interest in preventing the misuse of anonymous election-related speech justifies
a prohibition of all uses of that speech. The State may, and does, punish fraud
directly. But it cannot seek to punish fraud indirectly by indiscriminately
outlawing a category of speech, based on its content, with no necessary
relationship to the danger sought to be prevented. One would be hard pressed

Robson

580

The First Amendment

to think of a better example of the pitfalls of Ohio's blunderbuss approach than
the facts of the case before us.
The judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court is reversed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE GINSBURG, CONCURRING.
The dissent is stirring in its appreciation of democratic values. But I do not see
the Court's opinion as unguided by "bedrock principle," tradition, or our case
law. Margaret McIntyre's case, it seems to me, bears a marked resemblance to
Margaret Gilleo's case [City of Ladue v. Gilleo (1994)] and Mary Grace's [United
States v. Grace (1983)]. All three decisions, I believe, are sound, and hardly
sensational, applications of our First Amendment jurisprudence.
In for a calf is not always in for a cow. The Court's decision finds unnecessary,
overintrusive, and inconsistent with American ideals the State's imposition of a
fine on an individual leafleteer who, within her local community, spoke her
mind, but sometimes not her name. We do not thereby hold that the State may
not in other, larger circumstances, require the speaker to disclose its interest by
disclosing its identity. Appropriately leaving open matters not presented by
McIntyre's handbills, the Court recognizes that a State's interest in protecting
an election process "might justify a more limited identification requirement."
But the Court has convincingly explained why Ohio lacks "cause for inhibiting
the leafletting at issue here."
JUSTICE THOMAS, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
I agree with the majority's conclusion that Ohio's election law, Ohio Rev. Code
Ann. 3599.09(A), is inconsistent with the First Amendment. I would apply,
however, a different methodology to this case. Instead of asking whether "an
honorable tradition" of anonymous speech has existed throughout American
history, or what the "value" of anonymous speech might be, we should
determine whether the phrase "freedom of speech, or of the press," as originally
understood, protected anonymous political leafletting. I believe that it did.
*** [Extensive discussion of history omitted].
I cannot join the majority's analysis because it deviates from our settled
approach to interpreting the Constitution and because it superimposes its
modern theories concerning expression upon the constitutional text. Whether
"great works of literature" - by Voltaire or George Eliot have been published
anonymously should be irrelevant to our analysis, because it sheds no light on
what the phrases "free speech" or "free press" meant to the people who drafted
and ratified the First Amendment. Similarly, whether certain types of
expression have "value" today has little significance; what is important is
whether the Framers in 1791 believed anonymous speech sufficiently valuable
to deserve the protection of the Bill of Rights. And although the majority
faithfully follows our approach to "content-based" speech regulations, we need
not undertake this analysis when the original understanding provides the
answer. ***

JUSTICE SCALIA, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE JOINS, DISSENTING.
At a time when both political branches of Government and both political parties
reflect a popular desire to leave more decisionmaking authority to the States,
today's decision moves in the opposite direction, adding to the legacy of
inflexible central mandates (irrevocable even by Congress) imposed by this
Court's constitutional jurisprudence. In an opinion which reads as though it is
addressing some peculiar law like the Los Angeles municipal ordinance at issue
in Talley v. California (1960), the Court invalidates a species of protection for
the election process that exists, in a variety of forms, in every State except
California, and that has a pedigree dating back to the end of the 19th century.
Preferring the views of the English utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill to
the considered judgment of the American people's elected representatives from
coast to coast, the Court discovers a hitherto unknown right-to-be-unknown
while engaging in electoral politics. I dissent from this imposition of free-speech
imperatives that are demonstrably not those of the American people today, and
that there is inadequate reason to believe were those of the society that begat
the First Amendment or the Fourteenth.
The question posed by the present case is not the easiest sort to answer for
those who adhere to the Court's (and the society's) traditional view that the
Constitution bears its original meaning and is unchanging. ***
But to prove that anonymous electioneering was used frequently is not to
establish that it is a constitutional right. Quite obviously, not every restriction
upon expression that did not exist in 1791 or in 1868 is ipso facto
unconstitutional, or else modern election laws ***would be prohibited, as would
(to mention only a few other categories) modern antinoise regulation *** and
modern parade-permitting regulation ***.
Evidence that anonymous electioneering was regarded as a constitutional right
is sparse, and as far as I am aware evidence that it was generally regarded as
such is nonexistent. ***
*** I do not know where the Court derives its perception that "anonymous
pamphleteering is not a pernicious, fraudulent practice, but an honorable
tradition of advocacy and of dissent." I can imagine no reason why an
anonymous leaflet is any more honorable, as a general matter, than an
anonymous phone call or an anonymous letter. It facilitates wrong by
eliminating accountability, which is ordinarily the very purpose of the
anonymity. There are of course exceptions, and where anonymity is needed to
avoid "threats, harassment, or reprisals" the First Amendment will require an
exemption from the Ohio law. But to strike down the Ohio law in its general
application - and similar laws of 48 other States and the Federal Government on the ground that all anonymous communication is in our society traditionally
sacrosanct, seems to me a distortion of the past that will lead to a coarsening of
the future.
I respectfully dissent.

SOUTER AND GINSBURG, JJ., JOINED. SCALIA, J., FILED AN OPINION CONCURRING IN THE
JUDGMENT, IN WHICH THOMAS, J., JOINED. REHNQUIST, C. J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION.

JUSTICE STEVENS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Petitioners contend that a village ordinance making it a misdemeanor to engage
in door-to-door advocacy with- out first registering with the mayor and receiving
a permit violates the First Amendment. Through this facial challenge, we
consider the door-to-door canvassing regulation not only as it applies to
religious proselytizing, but also to anonymous political speech and the
distribution of handbills.
I
Petitioner Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., coordinates the
preaching activities of Jehovah's Witnesses throughout the United States and
publishes Bibles and religious periodicals that are widely distributed. Petitioner
Wellsville, Ohio, Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, Inc., supervises the
activities of approximately 59 members in a part of Ohio that includes the
Village of Stratton (Village). Petitioners offer religious literature without cost to
anyone interested in reading it. They allege that they do not solicit
contributions or orders for the sale of merchandise or services, but they do
accept donations.
Petitioners brought this action against the Village and its mayor in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, seeking an injunction
against the enforcement of several sections of Ordinance No. 1998-5 regulating
uninvited peddling and solicitation on private property in the Village.
Petitioners' complaint alleged that the ordinance violated several constitutional
rights, including the free exercise of religion, free speech, and the freedom of the
press. The District Court conducted a bench trial at which evidence of the
administration of the ordinance and its effect on petitioners was introduced.
Section 116.01 prohibits "canvassers" and others from "going in and upon"
private residential property for the purpose of promoting any "cause" without
first having obtained a permit pursuant to §116.03.1 That section provides that
any canvasser who intends to go on private property to promote a cause, must
obtain a "Solicitation Permit" from the office of the mayor; there is no charge for
the permit, and apparently one is issued routinely after an applicant fills out a
fairly detailed "Solicitor's Registration Form." The canvasser is then authorized
to go upon premises that he listed on the registration form, but he must carry
the permit upon his person and exhibit it whenever requested to do so by a
police officer or by a resident. The ordinance sets forth grounds for the denial or
revocation of a permit, but the record before us does not show that any

Robson

583

The First Amendment

application has been denied or that any permit has been revoked. Petitioners
did not apply for a permit.
A section of the ordinance that petitioners do not challenge establishes a
procedure by which a resident may prohibit solicitation even by holders of
permits. If the resident files a "No Solicitation Registration Form" with the
mayor, and also posts a "No Solicitation" sign on his property, no uninvited
canvassers may enter his property, unless they are specifically authorized to do
so in the "No Solicitation Registration Form" itself. Only 32 of the Village's 278
residents filed such forms. Each of the forms in the record contains a list of 19
suggested exceptions; on one form, a resident checked 17 exceptions, thereby
excluding only "Jehovah's Witnesses" and "Political Candidates" from the list of
invited canvassers. Although Jehovah's Witnesses do not consider themselves
to be "solicitors" because they make no charge for their literature or their
teaching, leaders of the church testified at trial that they would honor "no
solicitation" signs in the Village. They also explained at trial that they did not
apply for a permit because they derive their authority to preach from Scripture.
"For us to seek a permit from a municipality to preach we feel would almost be
an insult to God."
Petitioners introduced some evidence that the ordinance was the product of the
mayor's hostility to their ministry, but the District Court credited the mayor's
testimony that it had been designed to protect the privacy rights of the Village
residents, specifically to protect them "from `flim flam' con artists who prey on
small town populations." Nevertheless, the court concluded that the terms of
the ordinance applied to the activities of petitioners as well as to "business or
political canvassers."
The District Court upheld most provisions of the ordinance as valid, contentneutral regulations that did not infringe on petitioners' First Amendment rights.
The court did, however, require the Village to accept narrowing constructions of
three provisions. First, the court viewed the requirement in §116.03(b)(5) that
the applicant must list the specific address of each residence to be visited as
potentially invalid, but cured by the Village's agreement to attach to the form a
list of willing residents. Second, it held that petitioners could comply with
§116.03(b)(6) by merely stating their purpose as "the Jehovah's Witness
ministry." And third, it held that §116.05, which limited canvassing to the
hours before 5 p.m., was invalid on its face and should be replaced with a
provision referring to "reasonable hours of the day." As so modified, the court
held the ordinance constitutionally valid as applied to petitioners and dismissed
the case.
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. It held that the ordinance
was "content neutral and of general applicability and therefore subject to
intermediate scrutiny." It rejected petitioners' reliance on the discussion of laws
affecting both the free exercise of religion and free speech in Employment Div.,
Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith (1990) [Chapter 14] because that
"language was dicta and therefore not binding." It also rejected petitioners'
argument that the ordinance is overbroad because it impairs the right to
distribute pamphlets anonymously that we recognized in McIntyre v. Ohio
Elections Comm'n (1995), reasoning that "the very act of going door-to-door
requires the canvassers to reveal a portion of their identities." The Court of

Robson

584

The First Amendment

Appeals concluded that the interests promoted by the Village--"protecting its
residents from fraud and undue annoyance"--as well as the harm that it seeks
to prevent--"criminals posing as canvassers in order to defraud its residents"-though "by no means overwhelming," were sufficient to justify the regulation.
The court distinguished earlier cases protecting the Jehovah's Witnesses
ministry because those cases either involved a flat prohibition on the
dissemination of ideas or an ordinance that left the issuance of a permit to the
discretion of a municipal officer.
In dissent, Judge Gilman expressed the opinion that by subjecting
noncommercial solicitation to the permit requirements, the ordinance
significantly restricted a substantial quantity of speech unrelated to the
Village's interest in eliminating fraud and unwanted annoyance. In his view, the
Village "failed to demonstrate either the reality of the harm or the efficacy of the
restriction."
We granted certiorari to decide the following question: "Does a municipal
ordinance that requires one to obtain a permit prior to engaging in the door-todoor advocacy of a political cause and to display upon demand the permit,
which contains one's name, violate the First Amendment protection accorded to
anonymous pamphleteering or discourse?"
II
For over 50 years, the Court has invalidated restrictions on door-to-door
canvassing and pamphleteering. It is more than historical accident that most of
these cases involved First Amendment challenges brought by Jehovah's
Witnesses, because door-to-door canvassing is mandated by their religion. As
we noted in Murdock v. Pennsylvania (1943), the Jehovah's Witnesses "claim to
follow the example of Paul, teaching `publicly, and from house to house.' Acts
20:20. They take literally the mandate of the Scriptures, `Go ye into all the
world, and preach the gospel to every creature.' Mark 16:15. In doing so they
believe that they are obeying a commandment of God." Moreover, because they
lack significant financial resources, the ability of the Witnesses to proselytize is
seriously diminished by regulations that burden their efforts to canvass doorto-door.
Although our past cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses, most of which were
decided shortly before and during World War II, do not directly control the
question we confront today, they provide both a historical and analytical
backdrop for consideration of petitioners' First Amendment claim that the
breadth of the Village's ordinance offends the First Amendment. Those cases
involved petty offenses that raised constitutional questions of the most serious
magnitude--questions that implicated the free exercise of religion, the freedom
of speech, and the freedom of the press. From these decisions, several themes
emerge that guide our consideration of the ordinance at issue here.
First, the cases emphasize the value of the speech involved. For example, in
Murdock v. Pennsylvania, the Court noted that "hand distribution of religious
tracts is an age-old form of missionary evangelism--as old as the history of
printing presses. It has been a potent force in various religious movements
down through the years... . This form of religious activity occupies the same

Robson

585

The First Amendment

high estate under the First Amendment as do worship in the churches and
preaching from the pulpits. It has the same claim to protection as the more
orthodox and conventional exercises of religion. It also has the same claim as
the others to the guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press."
In addition, the cases discuss extensively the historical importance of door-todoor canvassing and pamphleteering as vehicles for the dissemination of ideas.
In Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington) (1939), the petitioner was a Jehovah's
Witness who had been convicted of canvassing without a permit based on
evidence that she had gone from house to house offering to leave books or
booklets. Writing for the Court, Justice Roberts stated that "pamphlets have
proved most effective instruments in the dissemination of opinion. And perhaps
the most effective way of bringing them to the notice of individuals is their
distribution at the homes of the people. On this method of communication the
ordinance imposes censorship, abuse of which engendered the struggle in
England which eventuated in the establishment of the doctrine of the freedom
of the press embodied in our Constitution. To require a censorship through
license which makes impossible the free and unhampered distribution of
pamphlets strikes at the very heart of the constitutional guarantees." (emphasis
added).
Despite the emphasis on the important role that door-to-door canvassing and
pamphleteering has played in our constitutional tradition of free and open
discussion, these early cases also recognized the interests a town may have in
some form of regulation, particularly when the solicitation of money is involved.
In Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940), the Court held that an ordinance requiring
Jehovah's Witnesses to obtain a license before soliciting door to door was
invalid because the issuance of the license depended on the exercise of
discretion by a city official. Our opinion recognized that "a State may protect its
citizens from fraudulent solicitation by requiring a stranger in the community,
before permitting him publicly to solicit funds for any purpose, to establish his
identity and his authority to act for the cause which he purports to represent."
Similarly, in Martin v. City of Struthers, the Court recognized crime prevention
as a legitimate interest served by these ordinances and noted that "burglars
frequently pose as canvassers, either in order that they may have a pretense to
discover whether a house is empty and hence ripe for burglary, or for the
purpose of spying out the premises in order that they may return later." Despite
recognition of these interests as legitimate, our precedent is clear that there
must be a balance between these interests and the effect of the regulations on
First Amendment rights. We "must `be astute to examine the effect of the
challenged legislation' and must `weigh the circumstances and ... appraise the
substantiality of the reasons advanced in support of the regulation.' "
Finally, the cases demonstrate that efforts of the Jehovah's Witnesses to resist
speech regulation have not been a struggle for their rights alone. In Martin, after
cataloging the many groups that rely extensively upon this method of
communication, the Court summarized that "[d]oor to door distribution of
circulars is essential to the poorly financed causes of little people."
That the Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only "little people" who face the risk of
silencing by regulations like the Village's is exemplified by our cases involving
nonreligious speech. In Thomas [v. Collins (1945)], the issue was whether a

Robson

586

The First Amendment

labor leader could be required to obtain a permit before delivering a speech to
prospective union members. After reviewing the Jehovah's Witnesses cases
discussed above, the Court observed:
"As a matter of principle a requirement of registration in order to make a public
speech would seem generally incompatible with an exercise of the rights of free
speech and free assembly... .
.....
"If the exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly cannot be made a
crime, we do not think this can be accomplished by the device of requiring
previous registration as a condition for exercising them and making such a
condition the foundation for restraining in advance their exercise and for
imposing a penalty for violating such a restraining order. So long as no more is
involved than exercise of the rights of free speech and free assembly, it is
immune to such a restriction. If one who solicits support for the cause of labor
may be required to register as a condition to the exercise of his right to make a
public speech, so may he who seeks to rally support for any social, business,
religious or political cause. We think a requirement that one must register before
he undertakes to make a public speech to enlist support for a lawful movement
is quite incompatible with the requirements of the First Amendment."

Although these World War II-era cases provide guidance for our consideration of
the question presented, they do not answer one preliminary issue that the
parties adamantly dispute. That is, what standard of review ought we use in
assessing the constitutionality of this ordinance. We find it unnecessary,
however, to resolve that dispute because the breadth of speech affected by the
ordinance and the nature of the regulation make it clear that the Court of
Appeals erred in upholding it.
III
The Village argues that three interests are served by its ordinance: the
prevention of fraud, the prevention of crime, and the protection of residents'
privacy. We have no difficulty concluding, in light of our precedent, that these
are important interests that the Village may seek to safeguard through some
form of regulation of solicitation activity. We must also look, however, to the
amount of speech covered by the ordinance and whether there is an appropriate
balance between the affected speech and the governmental interests that the
ordinance purports to serve.
The text of the Village's ordinance prohibits "canvassers" from going on private
property for the purpose of explaining or promoting any "cause," unless they
receive a permit and the residents visited have not opted for a "no solicitation"
sign. Had this provision been construed to apply only to commercial activities
and the solicitation of funds, arguably the ordinance would have been tailored
to the Village's interest in protecting the privacy of its residents and preventing
fraud. Yet, even though the Village has explained that the ordinance was
adopted to serve those interests, it has never contended that it should be so
narrowly interpreted. To the contrary, the Village's administration of its
ordinance unquestionably demonstrates that the provisions apply to a
significant number of noncommercial "canvassers" promoting a wide variety of
"causes." Indeed, on the "No Solicitation Forms" provided to the residents, the
canvassers include "Camp Fire Girls," "Jehovah's Witnesses," "Political
Candidates," "Trick or Treaters during Halloween Season," and "Persons

Affiliated with Stratton Church." The ordinance unquestionably applies, not
only to religious causes, but to political activity as well. It would seem to extend
to "residents casually soliciting the votes of neighbors," or ringing doorbells to
enlist support for employing a more efficient garbage collector.
The mere fact that the ordinance covers so much speech raises constitutional
concerns. It is offensive--not only to the values protected by the First
Amendment, but to the very notion of a free society--that in the context of
everyday public discourse a citizen must first inform the government of her
desire to speak to her neighbors and then obtain a permit to do so. Even if the
issuance of permits by the mayor's office is a ministerial task that is performed
promptly and at no cost to the applicant, a law requiring a permit to engage in
such speech constitutes a dramatic departure from our national heritage and
constitutional tradition. Three obvious examples illustrate the pernicious effect
of such a permit requirement.
First, as our cases involving distribution of unsigned handbills demonstrate,
there are a significant number of persons who support causes anonymously.
"The decision to favor anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or
official retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a desire to
preserve as much of one's privacy as possible." McIntyre v. Ohio Elections
Comm'n. The requirement that a canvasser must be identified in a permit
application filed in the mayor's office and available for public inspection
necessarily results in a surrender of that anonymity. Although it is true, as the
Court of Appeals suggested, that persons who are known to the resident reveal
their allegiance to a group or cause when they present themselves at the front
door to advocate an issue or to deliver a handbill, the Court of Appeals erred in
concluding that the ordinance does not implicate anonymity interests. The
Sixth Circuit's reasoning is undermined by our decision in Buckley v. American
Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc. (1999). The badge requirement that we
invalidated in Buckley applied to petition circulators seeking signatures in faceto-face interactions. The fact that circulators revealed their physical identities
did not foreclose our consideration of the circulators' interest in maintaining
their anonymity. In the Village, strangers to the resident certainly maintain
their anonymity, and the ordinance may preclude such persons from
canvassing for unpopular causes. Such preclusion may well be justified in some
situations--for example, by the special state interest in protecting the integrity
of a ballot-initiative process, see ibid., or by the interest in preventing
fraudulent commercial transactions. The Village ordinance, however, sweeps
more broadly, covering unpopular causes unrelated to commercial transactions
or to any special interest in protecting the electoral process.
Second, requiring a permit as a prior condition on the exercise of the right to
speak imposes an objective burden on some speech of citizens holding religious
or patriotic views. As our World War II-era cases dramatically demonstrate,
there are a significant number of persons whose religious scruples will prevent
them from applying for such a license. There are no doubt other patriotic
citizens, who have such firm convictions about their constitutional right to
engage in uninhibited debate in the context of door-to-door advocacy, that they
would prefer silence to speech licensed by a petty official.
Third, there is a significant amount of spontaneous speech that is effectively

Robson

588

The First Amendment

banned by the ordinance. A person who made a decision on a holiday or a
weekend to take an active part in a political campaign could not begin to pass
out handbills until after he or she obtained the required permit. Even a
spontaneous decision to go across the street and urge a neighbor to vote
against the mayor could not lawfully be implemented without first obtaining the
mayor's permission. In this respect, the regulation is analogous to the
circulation licensing tax the Court invalidated in Grosjean v. American Press Co.
(1936). In Grosjean, while discussing the history of the Free Press Clause of the
First Amendment, the Court stated that " `[t]he evils to be prevented were not
the censorship of the press merely, but any action of the government by means
of which it might prevent such free and general discussion of public matters as
seems absolutely essential to prepare the people for an intelligent exercise of
their rights as citizens.' "
The breadth and unprecedented nature of this regulation does not alone render
the ordinance invalid. Also central to our conclusion that the ordinance does
not pass First Amendment scrutiny is that it is not tailored to the Village's
stated interests. Even if the interest in preventing fraud could adequately
support the ordinance insofar as it applies to commercial transactions and the
solicitation of funds, that interest provides no support for its application to
petitioners, to political campaigns, or to enlisting support for unpopular causes.
The Village, however, argues that the ordinance is nonetheless valid because it
serves the two additional interests of protecting the privacy of the resident and
the prevention of crime.
With respect to the former, it seems clear that §107 of the ordinance, which
provides for the posting of "No Solicitation" signs and which is not challenged in
this case, coupled with the resident's unquestioned right to refuse to engage in
conversation with unwelcome visitors, provides ample protection for the
unwilling listener. The annoyance caused by an uninvited knock on the front
door is the same whether or not the visitor is armed with a permit.
With respect to the latter, it seems unlikely that the absence of a permit would
preclude criminals from knocking on doors and engaging in conversations not
covered by the ordinance. They might, for example, ask for directions or
permission to use the telephone, or pose as surveyers or census takers. Or they
might register under a false name with impunity because the ordinance
contains no provision for verifying an applicant's identity or organizational
credentials. Moreover, the Village did not assert an interest in crime prevention
below, and there is an absence of any evidence of a special crime problem
related to door-to-door solicitation in the record before us.
The rhetoric used in the World War II-era opinions that repeatedly saved
petitioners' coreligionists from petty prosecutions reflected the Court's
evaluation of the First Amendment freedoms that are implicated in this case.
The value judgment that then motivated a united democratic people fighting to
defend those very freedoms from totalitarian attack is unchanged. It motivates
our decision today.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

CONCURRING OPINIONS [OMITTED].
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, DISSENTING.
Stratton is a village of 278 people located along the Ohio River where the
borders of Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania converge. It is strung out
along a multilane highway connecting it with the cities of East Liverpool to the
north and Steubenville and Weirton, West Virginia, to the south. One may
doubt how much legal help a village of this size has available in drafting an
ordinance such as the present one, but even if it had availed itself of a battery
of constitutional lawyers, they would have been of little use in the town's effort.
For the Court today ignores the cases on which those lawyers would have relied,
and comes up with newly fashioned doctrine. This doctrine contravenes wellestablished precedent, renders local governments largely impotent to address
the very real safety threat that canvassers pose, and may actually result in less
of the door-to-door communication that it seeks to protect.
*** A recent double murder in Hanover, New Hampshire, a town of
approximately 7,500 that would appear tranquil to most Americans but would
probably seem like a bustling town of Dartmouth College students to Stratton
residents, illustrates these dangers. Two teenagers murdered a married couple
of Dartmouth College professors, Half and Susanne Zantop, in the Zantop's
home. Investigators have concluded, based on the confession of one of the
teenagers, that the teenagers went door-to-door intent on stealing access
numbers to bank debit cards and then killing their owners. See Dartmouth
Professors Called Random Targets, WASHINGTON POST, Feb. 20, 2002, p. A2.
Their modus operandi was to tell residents that they were conducting an
environmental survey for school. They canvassed a few homes where no one
answered. At another, the resident did not allow them in to conduct the
"survey." They were allowed into the Zantop home. After conducting the phony
environmental survey, they stabbed the Zantops to death.
In order to reduce these very grave risks associated with canvassing, the 278 "
`little people,' " of Stratton, who, unlike petitioners, do not have a team of
attorneys at their ready disposal, see Jehovah's Witnesses May Make High Court
History Again, LEGAL TIMES, Feb. 25, 2002, p. 1 (noting that petitioners have a
team of 12 lawyers in their New York headquarters), enacted the ordinance at
issue here. The residents did not prohibit door-to-door communication, they
simply required that canvassers obtain a permit before going door-to-door. And
the village does not have the discretion to reject an applicant who completes the
application.
The town had little reason to suspect that the negligible burden of having to
obtain a permit runs afoul of the First Amendment. For over 60 years, we have
categorically stated that a permit requirement for door-to-door canvassers,
which gives no discretion to the issuing authority, is constitutional. The District
Court and Court of Appeals, relying on our cases, upheld the ordinance. The
Court today, however, abruptly changes course and invalidates the ordinance.
*** It is telling that Justices Douglas and Black, perhaps the two Justices in
this Court's history most identified with an expansive view of the First

Robson

590

The First Amendment

Amendment, authored, respectively, Murdock and Martin. Their belief in the
constitutionality of the permit requirement that the Court strikes down today
demonstrates just how far the Court's present jurisprudence has strayed from
the core concerns of the First Amendment.
*** The ordinance prevents and detects serious crime by making it a crime not
to register. Take the Hanover double murder discussed earlier. The murderers
did not achieve their objective until they visited their fifth home over a period of
seven months. If Hanover had a permit requirement, the teens may have been
stopped before they achieved their objective. One of the residents they visited
may have informed the police that there were two canvassers who lacked a
permit. Such neighborly vigilance, though perhaps foreign to those residing in
modern day cities, is not uncommon in small towns. Or the police on their own
may have discovered that two canvassers were violating the ordinance.
Apprehension for violating the permit requirement may well have frustrated the
teenagers' objectives; it certainly would have assisted in solving the murders
had the teenagers gone ahead with their plan.††
Of course, the Stratton ordinance does not guarantee that no canvasser will
ever commit a burglary or violent crime. The Court seems to think this dooms
the ordinance, erecting an insurmountable hurdle that a law must provide a
fool-proof method of preventing crime. In order to survive intermediate scrutiny,
however, a law need not solve the crime problem, it need only further the
interest in preventing crime. Some deterrence of serious criminal activity is
more than enough to survive intermediate scrutiny.
The final requirement of intermediate scrutiny is that a regulation leave open
ample alternatives for expression. Undoubtedly, ample alternatives exist here.
Most obviously, canvassers are free to go door-to-door after filling out the
permit application. And those without permits may communicate on public
sidewalks, on street corners, through the mail, or through the telephone.
*** Today, the Court elevates its concern with what is, at most, a negligible
burden on door-to-door communication above this established proposition.
Ironically, however, today's decision may result in less of the door-to-door
communication that the Court extols. As the Court recognizes, any homeowner
may place a "No Solicitation" sign on his or her property, and it is a crime to
violate that sign. In light of today's decision depriving Stratton residents of the
degree of accountability and safety that the permit requirement provides, more
and more residents may decide to place these signs in their yards and cut off
door-to-door communication altogether.

††

	  Indeed, an increased focus on apprehending criminals for "petty" offenses, such as not paying subway
fares, is credited with the dramatic reduction in violent crimes in New York City during the last decade. See,
e.g., M. GLADWELL, THE TIPPING POINT: HOW LITTLE THINGS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE (2000). If this works in
New York City, surely it can work in a small village like Stratton.

THOMAS, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The State of Washington allows its citizens to challenge state laws by
referendum. Roughly four percent of Washington voters must sign a petition to
place such a referendum on the ballot. That petition, which by law must
include the names and addresses of the signers, is then submitted to the
government for verification and canvassing, to ensure that only lawful
signatures are counted. The Washington Public Records Act (PRA) authorizes
private parties to obtain copies of government documents, and the State
construes the PRA to cover submitted referendum petitions.
This case arises out of a state law extending certain benefits to same-sex
couples, and a corresponding referendum petition to put that law to a popular
vote. Respondent intervenors invoked the PRA to obtain copies of the petition,
with the names and addresses of the signers. Certain petition signers and the
petition sponsor objected, arguing that such public disclosure would violate
their rights under the First Amendment.
The course of this litigation, however, has framed the legal question before us
more broadly. The issue at this stage of the case is not whether disclosure of
this particular petition would violate the First Amendment, but whether
disclosure of referendum petitions in general would do so. We conclude that
such disclosure does not as a general matter violate the First Amendment, and
we therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. We leave it to the
lower courts to consider in the first instance the signers' more focused claim
concerning disclosure of the information on this particular petition, which is
pending before the District Court.
I
The Washington Constitution reserves to the people the power to reject any bill,
with a few limited exceptions not relevant here, through the referendum process.
Wash. Const., Art. II, §1(b). To initiate a referendum, proponents must file a
petition with the secretary of state that contains valid signatures of registered
Washington voters equal to or exceeding four percent of the votes cast for the
office of Governor at the last gubernatorial election. §§1(b), (d). A valid
submission requires not only a signature, but also the signer's address and the
county in which he is registered to vote. Wash. Rev. Code §29A.72.130 (2008).
In May 2009, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire signed into law Senate
Bill 5688, which "expand[ed] the rights and responsibilities" of state-registered
domestic partners, including same-sex domestic partners. That same month,
Protect Marriage Washington, one of the petitioners here, was organized as a

Robson

592

The First Amendment

"State Political Committee" for the purpose of collecting the petition signatures
necessary to place a referendum on the ballot, which would give the voters
themselves an opportunity to vote on SB 5688. If the referendum made it onto
the ballot, Protect Marriage Washington planned to encourage voters to reject
SB 5688.
On July 25, 2009, Protect Marriage Washington submitted to the secretary of
state a petition containing over 137,000 signatures. The secretary of state then
began the verification and canvassing process, as required by Washington law,
to ensure that only legal signatures were counted. Some 120,000 valid
signatures were required to place the referendum on the ballot. Sam Reed,
Washington Secretary of State, Certification of Referendum 71 (Sept. 2, 2009).
The secretary of state determined that the petition contained a sufficient
number of valid signatures, and the referendum (R-71) appeared on the
November 2009 ballot. The voters approved SB 5688 by a margin of 53% to
47%.
The PRA, Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001 et seq., makes all "public records"
available for public inspection and copying. §42.56.070(1) (2008). The Act
defines "[p]ublic record" as "any writing containing information relating to the
conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary
function prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency."
§42.56.010(2). Washington takes the position that referendum petitions are
"public records."
By August 20, 2009, the secretary had received requests for copies of the R-71
petition from an individual and four entities, including Washington Coalition for
Open Government (WCOG) and Washington Families Standing Together (WFST),
two of the respondents here. Two entities, WhoSigned.org and
KnowThyNeighbor.org, issued a joint press release stating their intention to
post the names of the R-71 petition signers online, in a searchable format.
The referendum petition sponsor and certain signers filed a complaint and a
motion for a preliminary injunction in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Washington, seeking to enjoin the secretary of state from
publicly releasing any documents that would reveal the names and contact
information of the R-71 petition signers. Count I of the complaint alleges that
"[t]he Public Records Act is unconstitutional as applied to referendum
petitions." Count II of the complaint alleges that "[t]he Public Records Act is
unconstitutional as applied to the Referendum 71 petition because there is a
reasonable probability that the signatories of the Referendum 71 petition will be
subjected to threats, harassment, and reprisals." Determining that the PRA
burdened core political speech, the District Court held that plaintiffs were likely
to succeed on the merits of Count I and granted them a preliminary injunction
on that count, enjoining release of the information on the petition.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Reviewing
only Count I of the complaint, the Court of Appeals held that plaintiffs were
unlikely to succeed on their claim that the PRA is unconstitutional as applied to
referendum petitions generally. It therefore reversed the District Court's grant of
the preliminary injunction. We granted certiorari.
II

Robson

593

The First Amendment

It is important at the outset to define the scope of the challenge before us. As
noted, Count I of the complaint contends that the PRA "violates the First
Amendment as applied to referendum petitions." Count II asserts that the PRA
"is unconstitutional as applied to the Referendum 71 petition." The District
Court decision was based solely on Count I; the Court of Appeals decision
reversing the District Court was similarly limited. Neither court addressed
Count II.
The parties disagree about whether Count I is properly viewed as a facial or asapplied challenge. It obviously has characteristics of both: The claim is "as
applied" in the sense that it does not seek to strike the PRA in all its
applications, but only to the extent it covers referendum petitions. The claim is
"facial" in that it is not limited to plaintiffs' particular case, but challenges
application of the law more broadly to all referendum petitions.
The label is not what matters. The important point is that plaintiffs' claim and
the relief that would follow--an injunction barring the secretary of state "from
making referendum petitions available to the public--reach beyond the
particular circumstances of these plaintiffs. They must therefore satisfy our
standards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.
III
A
The compelled disclosure of signatory information on referendum petitions is
subject to review under the First Amendment. An individual expresses a view
on a political matter when he signs a petition under Washington's referendum
procedure. In most cases, the individual's signature will express the view that
the law subject to the petition should be overturned. Even if the signer is
agnostic as to the merits of the underlying law, his signature still expresses the
political view that the question should be considered "by the whole electorate."
In either case, the expression of a political view implicates a First Amendment
right. The State, having "cho[sen] to tap the energy and the legitimizing power of
the democratic process, ... must accord the participants in that process the
First Amendment rights that attach to their roles." Republican Party of Minn. v.
White (2002).
Respondents counter that signing a petition is a legally operative legislative act
and therefore "does not involve any significant expressive element." It is true
that signing a referendum petition may ultimately have the legal consequence of
requiring the secretary of state to place the referendum on the ballot. But we do
not see how adding such legal effect to an expressive activity somehow deprives
that activity of its expressive component, taking it outside the scope of the First
Amendment. Respondents themselves implicitly recognize that the signature
expresses a particular viewpoint, arguing that one purpose served by disclosure
is to allow the public to engage signers in a debate on the merits of the
underlying law.
Petition signing remains expressive even when it has legal effect in the electoral
process. But that is not to say that the electoral context is irrelevant to the
nature of our First Amendment review. We allow States significant flexibility in
implementing their own voting systems. To the extent a regulation concerns the
legal effect of a particular activity in that process, the government will be

Robson

594

The First Amendment

afforded substantial latitude to enforce that regulation. Also pertinent to our
analysis is the fact that the PRA is not a prohibition on speech, but instead a
disclosure requirement. "[D]isclosure requirements may burden the ability to
speak, but they ... do not prevent anyone from speaking." Citizens United v.
Federal Election Comm'n (2010).
We have a series of precedents considering First Amendment challenges to
disclosure requirements in the electoral context. These precedents have
reviewed such challenges under what has been termed "exacting scrutiny." See,
e.g., Buckley v. Valeo (1976); Citizens United (2010); Davis v. Federal Election
Comm'n, (2008); Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc. (ACLF)
(1999).
That standard "requires a 'substantial relation' between the disclosure
requirement and a 'sufficiently important' governmental interest." Citizens
United. To withstand this scrutiny, "the strength of the governmental interest
must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First Amendment rights."
B
Respondents assert two interests to justify the burdens of compelled disclosure
under the PRA on First Amendment rights: (1) preserving the integrity of the
electoral process by combating fraud, detecting invalid signatures, and fostering
government transparency and accountability; and (2) providing information to
the electorate about who supports the petition. Because we determine that the
State's interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral process suffices to
defeat the argument that the PRA is unconstitutional with respect to
referendum petitions in general, we need not, and do not, address the State's
"informational" interest.
The State's interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral process is
undoubtedly important. "States allowing ballot initiatives have considerable
leeway to protect the integrity and reliability of the initiative process, as they
have with respect to election processes generally." ACLF. The State's interest is
particularly strong with respect to efforts to root out fraud, which not only may
produce fraudulent outcomes, but has a systemic effect as well: It "drives
honest citizens out of the democratic process and breeds distrust of our
government." The threat of fraud in this context is not merely hypothetical;
respondents and their amici cite a number of cases of petition-related fraud
across the country to support the point.
But the State's interest in preserving electoral integrity is not limited to
combating fraud. That interest extends to efforts to ferret out invalid signatures
caused not by fraud but by simple mistake, such as duplicate signatures or
signatures of individuals who are not registered to vote in the State. That
interest also extends more generally to promoting transparency and
accountability in the electoral process, which the State argues is "essential to
the proper functioning of a democracy."
Plaintiffs contend that the disclosure requirements of the PRA are not
"sufficiently related" to the interest of protecting the integrity of the electoral
process. They argue that disclosure is not necessary because the secretary of
state is already charged with verifying and canvassing the names on a petition,
advocates and opponents of a measure can observe that process, and any

Robson

595

The First Amendment

citizen can challenge the secretary's actions in court. They also stress that
existing criminal penalties reduce the danger of fraud in the petition process.
But the secretary's verification and canvassing will not catch all invalid
signatures: The job is large and difficult (the secretary ordinarily checks "only 3
to 5% of signatures," Brief for Respondent), and the secretary can make
mistakes, too. Public disclosure can help cure the inadequacies of the
verification and canvassing process.
Disclosure also helps prevent certain types of petition fraud otherwise difficult
to detect, such as outright forgery and "bait and switch" fraud, in which an
individual signs the petition based on a misrepresentation of the underlying
issue. The signer is in the best position to detect these types of fraud, and
public disclosure can bring the issue to the signer's attention.
Public disclosure thus helps ensure that the only signatures counted are those
that should be, and that the only referenda placed on the ballot are those that
garner enough valid signatures. Public disclosure also promotes transparency
and accountability in the electoral process to an extent other measures cannot.
In light of the foregoing, we reject plaintiffs' argument and conclude that public
disclosure of referendum petitions in general is substantially related to the
important interest of preserving the integrity of the electoral process.
C
Plaintiffs' more significant objection is that "the strength of the governmental
interest" does not "reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First
Amendment rights." According to plaintiffs, the objective of those seeking
disclosure of the R-71 petition is not to prevent fraud, but to publicly identify
those who had validly signed and to broadcast the signers' political views on the
subject of the petition. Plaintiffs allege, for example, that several groups plan to
post the petitions in searchable form on the Internet, and then encourage other
citizens to seek out the R-71 signers.
Plaintiffs explain that once on the Internet, the petition signers' names and
addresses "can be combined with publicly available phone numbers and maps,"
in what will effectively become a blueprint for harassment and intimidation. To
support their claim that they will be subject to reprisals, plaintiffs cite examples
from the history of a similar proposition in California, and from the experience
of one of the petition sponsors in this case.
In related contexts, we have explained that those resisting disclosure can
prevail under the First Amendment if they can show "a reasonable probability
that the compelled disclosure [of personal information] will subject them to
threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private
parties." Buckley; see also Citizens United. The question before us, however, is
not whether PRA disclosure violates the First Amendment with respect to those
who signed the R-71 petition, or other particularly controversial petitions. The
question instead is whether such disclosure in general violates the First
Amendment rights of those who sign referendum petitions.
The problem for plaintiffs is that their argument rests almost entirely on the
specific harm they say would attend disclosure of the information on the R-71
petition, or on similarly controversial ones. But typical referendum petitions

Robson

596

The First Amendment

"concern tax policy, revenue, budget, or other state law issues." Brief for
Respondent (listing referenda); see also App. 26 (stating that in recent years the
State has received PRA requests for petitions supporting initiatives concerning
limiting motor vehicle charges; government regulation of private property;
energy resource use by certain electric utilities; long-term care services for the
elderly and persons with disabilities; and state, county, and city revenue); id.,
at 26-27 (stating that in the past 20 years, referendum measures that have
qualified for the ballot in the State concerned land-use regulation;
unemployment insurance; charter public schools; and insurance coverage and
benefits). Voters care about such issues, some quite deeply--but there is no
reason to assume that any burdens imposed by disclosure of typical
referendum petitions would be remotely like the burdens plaintiffs fear in this
case.
Plaintiffs have offered little in response. They have provided us scant evidence
or argument beyond the burdens they assert disclosure would impose on R-71
petition signers or the signers of other similarly controversial petitions. Indeed,
what little plaintiffs do offer with respect to typical petitions in Washington
hurts, not helps: Several other petitions in the State "have been subject to
release in recent years," plaintiffs tell us, but apparently that release has come
without incident. Cf. Citizens United ("Citizens United has been disclosing its
donors for years and has identified no instance of harassment or retaliation").
Faced with the State's unrebutted arguments that only modest burdens attend
the disclosure of a typical petition, we must reject plaintiffs' broad challenge to
the PRA. In doing so, we note--as we have in other election law disclosure
cases--that upholding the law against a broad-based challenge does not
foreclose a litigant's success in a narrower one. See Buckley ("minor parties"
may be exempt from disclosure requirements if they can show "a reasonable
probability that the compelled disclosure of a party's contributors' names will
subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government
officials or private parties"); Citizens United (disclosure "would be
unconstitutional as applied to an organization if there were a reasonable
probability that the group's members would face threats, harassment, or
reprisals if their names were disclosed" The secretary of state acknowledges
that plaintiffs may press the narrower challenge in Count II of their complaint
in proceedings pending before the District Court.
We conclude that disclosure under the PRA would not violate the First
Amendment with respect to referendum petitions in general and therefore affirm
the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BREYER, CONCURRING [OMITTED].
JUSTICE ALITO, CONCURRING.
The Court holds that the disclosure under the Washington Public Records Act
(PRA), Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001 et seq. (2008), of the names and addresses
of persons who sign referendum petitions does not as a general matter violate
Robson

597

The First Amendment

the First Amendment and I agree with that conclusion. Many referendum
petitions concern relatively uncontroversial matters and plaintiffs have provided
no reason to think that disclosure of signatory information in those contexts
would significantly chill the willingness of voters to sign. Plaintiffs' facial
challenge therefore must fail.
Nonetheless, facially valid disclosure requirements can impose heavy burdens
on First Amendment rights in individual cases. Acknowledging that reality, we
have long held that speakers can obtain as-applied exemptions from disclosure
requirements if they can show "a reasonable probability that the compelled
disclosure of [personal information] will subject them to threats, harassment, or
reprisals from either Government officials or private parties." Buckley v. Valeo.
Because compelled disclosure can "burden the ability to speak," Citizens United
and "seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the
First Amendment," Buckley, the as-applied exemption plays a critical role in
safeguarding First Amendment rights.
I
[omitted]
II
*** In light of those principles, the plaintiffs in this case have a strong argument
that the PRA violates the First Amendment as applied to the Referendum 71
petition.
A
Consider first the burdens on plaintiffs' First Amendment rights. The
widespread harassment and intimidation suffered by supporters of California's
Proposition 8 provides strong support for an as-applied exemption in the
present case. Proposition 8 amended the California Constitution to provide that
"[o]nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in
California," Cal. Const., Art. I, §7.5, and plaintiffs submitted to the District
Court substantial evidence of the harassment suffered by Proposition 8
supporters. Members of this Court have also noted that harassment. See
Hollingsworth v. Perry (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 2-3); Citizens United
(opinion of Thomas, J.). Indeed, if the evidence relating to Proposition 8 is not
sufficient to obtain an as-applied exemption in this case, one may wonder
whether that vehicle provides any meaningful protection for the First
Amendment rights of persons who circulate and sign referendum and initiative
petitions.
What is more, when plaintiffs return to the District Court, they will have the
opportunity to develop evidence of intimidation and harassment of Referendum
71 supporters--an opportunity that was pretermitted because of the District
Court's decision to grant a preliminary injunction on count 1 of plaintiffs'
complaint. For example, plaintiffs allege that the campaign manager for one of
the plaintiff groups received threatening e-mails and phone calls, and that the
threats were so severe that the manager filed a complaint with the local sheriff
and had his children sleep in an interior room of his home.
B
The inadequacy of the State's interests in compelling public disclosure of
referendum signatory information further confirms that courts should be

Robson

598

The First Amendment

generous in granting as-applied relief in this context. As the Court notes,
respondents rely on two interests to justify compelled disclosure in this context:
(1) providing information to voters about who supports a referendum petition;
and (2) preserving the integrity of the referendum process by detecting
fraudulent and mistaken signatures.
1
In my view, respondents' asserted informational interest will not in any case be
sufficient to trump the First Amendment rights of signers and circulators who
face a threat of harassment. Respondents maintain that publicly disclosing the
names and addresses of referendum signatories provides the voting public with
"insight into whether support for holding a vote comes predominantly from
particular interest groups, political or religious organizations, or other group[s]
of citizens," and thus allows voters to draw inferences about whether they
should support or oppose the referendum. Additionally, respondents argue that
disclosure "allows Washington voters to engage in discussion of referred
measures with persons whose acts secured the election and suspension of state
law."
The implications of accepting such an argument are breathtaking. Were we to
accept respondents' asserted informational interest, the State would be free to
require petition signers to disclose all kinds of demographic information,
including the signer's race, religion, political affiliation, sexual orientation,
ethnic background, and interest-group memberships. Requiring such
disclosures, however, runs headfirst into a half century of our case law, which
firmly establishes that individuals have a right to privacy of belief and
association. See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.,
(2006); *** NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson (1958). Indeed, the State's
informational interest paints such a chilling picture of the role of government in
our lives that at oral argument the Washington attorney general balked when
confronted with the logical implications of accepting such an argument,
conceding that the State could not require petition signers to disclose their
religion or ethnicity.
Respondents' informational interest is no more legitimate when viewed as a
means of providing the public with information needed to locate and contact
supporters of a referendum. In the name of pursuing such an interest, the State
would be free to require petition signers to disclose any information that would
more easily enable members of the voting public to contact them and engage
them in discussion, including telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and
Internet aliases. Once again, permitting the government to require speakers to
disclose such information runs against the current of our associational privacy
cases. But more important, when speakers are faced with a reasonable
probability of harassment or intimidation, the State no longer has any interest
in enabling the public to locate and contact supporters of a particular measure-for in that instance, disclosure becomes a means of facilitating harassment
that impermissibly chills the exercise of First Amendment rights.
In this case, two groups proposed to place on the Internet the names and
addresses of all those who signed Referendum 71, and it is alleged that their
express aim was to encourage "uncomfortable conversation[s]." If this
information is posted on the Internet, then anyone with access to a computer

Robson

599

The First Amendment

could compile a wealth of information about all of those persons, including in
many cases all of the following: the names of their spouses and neighbors, their
telephone numbers, directions to their homes, pictures of their homes,
information about their homes (such as size, type of construction, purchase
price, and mortgage amount), information about any motor vehicles that they
own, any court case in which they were parties, any information posted on a
social networking site, and newspaper articles in which their names appeared
(including such things as wedding announcements, obituaries, and articles in
local papers about their children's school and athletic activities). The potential
that such information could be used for harassment is vast.
2
Respondents also maintain that the State has an interest in preserving the
integrity of the referendum process and that public disclosure furthers that
interest by helping the State detect fraudulent and mistaken signatures. I agree
with the Court that preserving the integrity of the referendum process
constitutes a sufficiently important state interest. But I harbor serious doubts
as to whether public disclosure of signatory information serves that interest in a
way that always "reflect[s] the seriousness of the actual burden on First
Amendment rights." ***
***As-applied challenges to disclosure requirements play a critical role in
protecting First Amendment freedoms. To give speech the breathing room it
needs to flourish, prompt judicial remedies must be available well before the
relevant speech occurs and the burden of proof must be low. In this case--both
through analogy and through their own experiences--plaintiffs have a strong
case that they are entitled to as-applied relief, and they will be able to pursue
such relief before the District Court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEVENS AND JUSTICE GINSBURG JOIN,
CONCURRING.
I write separately to emphasize a point implicit in the opinion of the Court and
the concurring opinions of Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, and Justice Breyer:
In assessing the countervailing interests at stake in this case, we must be
mindful of the character of initiatives and referenda. These mechanisms of
direct democracy are not compelled by the Federal Constitution. It is instead up
to the people of each State, acting in their sovereign capacity, to decide whether
and how to permit legislation by popular action. States enjoy "considerable
leeway" to choose the subjects that are eligible for placement on the ballot and
to specify the requirements for obtaining ballot access (e.g., the number of
signatures required, the time for submission, and the method of verification). As
the Court properly recognizes, each of these structural decisions "inevitably
affects--at least to some degree--the individual's right" to speak about political
issues and "to associate with others for political ends." ***
***Allowing case-specific invalidation under a more forgiving standard would
unduly diminish the substantial breathing room States are afforded to adopt
and implement reasonable, nondiscriminatory measures like the disclosure
requirement now at issue. Accordingly, courts presented with an as-applied
challenge to a regulation authorizing the disclosure of referendum petitions

Robson

600

The First Amendment

should be deeply skeptical of any assertion that the Constitution, which
embraces political transparency, compels States to conceal the identity of
persons who seek to participate in lawmaking through a state-created
referendum process. With this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court.
JUSTICE STEVENS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE BREYER JOINS, CONCURRING IN PART AND
CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
This is not a hard case. It is not about a restriction on voting or on speech and
does not involve a classic disclosure requirement. Rather, the case concerns a
neutral, nondiscriminatory policy of disclosing information already in the
State's possession that, it has been alleged, might one day indirectly burden
petition signatories. The burden imposed by Washington's application of the
Public Records Act (PRA) to referendum petitions in the vast majority, if not all,
its applications is not substantial. And the State has given a more than
adequate justification for its choice.
For a number of reasons, the application of the PRA to referendum petitions
does not substantially burden any individual's expression. First, it is not "a
regulation of pure speech." McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n (1995); cf. United
States v. O'Brien (1968). It does not prohibit expression, nor does it require that
any person signing a petition disclose or say anything at all. Nor does the
State's disclosure alter the content of a speaker's message.
Second, any effect on speech that disclosure might have is minimal. The PRA
does not necessarily make it more difficult to circulate or obtain signatures on a
petition, or to communicate one's views generally. Regardless of whether
someone signs a referendum petition, that person remains free to say anything
to anyone at any time. If disclosure indirectly burdens a speaker, "the amount
of speech covered" is small--only a single, narrow message conveying one fact in
one place. And while the democratic act of casting a ballot or signing a petition
does serve an expressive purpose, the act does not involve any "interactive
communication," and is "not principally" a method of "individual expression of
political sentiment."
Weighed against the possible burden on constitutional rights are the State's
justifications for its rule. In this case, the State has posited a perfectly adequate
justification: an interest in deterring and detecting petition fraud. Given the
pedigree of this interest and of similar regulations, the State need not produce
concrete evidence that the PRA is the best way to prevent fraud.
There remains the issue of petitioners' as-applied challenge. As a matter of law,
the Court is correct to keep open the possibility that in particular instances in
which a policy such as the PRA burdens expression "by the public enmity
attending publicity," Brown v. Socialist Workers '74 Campaign Comm. (Ohio)
(1982), speakers may have a winning constitutional claim. " '[F]rom time to time
throughout history,' " persecuted groups have been able " 'to criticize oppressive
practices and laws either anonymously or not at all.' " McIntyre.
In my view, this is unlikely to occur in cases involving the PRA. Any burden on
speech that petitioners posit is speculative as well as indirect. For an as-applied
challenge to a law such as the PRA to succeed, there would have to be a

Robson

601

The First Amendment

significant threat of harassment directed at those who sign the petition that
cannot be mitigated by law enforcement measures.5 Moreover, the character of
the law challenged in a referendum does not, in itself, affect the analysis.
Debates about tax policy and regulation of private property can become just as
heated as debates about domestic partnerships. And as a general matter, it is
very difficult to show that by later disclosing the names of petition signatories,
individuals will be less willing to sign petitions. Just as we have in the past, I
would demand strong evidence before concluding that an indirect and
speculative chain of events imposes a substantial burden on speech.***
Accordingly, I concur with the opinion of the Court to the extent that it is not
inconsistent with my own, and I concur in the judgment.
JUSTICE SCALIA, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
Plaintiffs claim the First Amendment, as applied to the States through the
Fourteenth Amendment, forbids the State of Washington to release to the public
signed referendum petitions, which they submitted to the State in order to
suspend operation of a law and put it to a popular vote. I doubt whether signing
a petition that has the effect of suspending a law fits within "the freedom of
speech" at all. But even if, as the Court concludes it does, a long history of
practice shows that the First Amendment does not prohibit public disclosure.
I
We should not repeat and extend the mistake of McIntyre v. Ohio Elections
Comm'n (1995). There, with neither textual support nor precedents requiring
the result, the Court invalidated a form of election regulation that had been
widely used by the States since the end of the 19th century. The Court held
that an Ohio statute prohibiting the distribution of anonymous campaign
literature violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. ***
***Plaintiffs contend that disclosure of the names, and other personal
information included on the petitions, of those who took this legislative action
violates their First Amendment right to anonymity.
Today's opinion acknowledges such a right, finding that it can be denied here
only because of the State's interest in "preserving the integrity of the electoral
process.” In my view this is not a matter for judicial interest-balancing. Our
Nation's longstanding traditions of legislating and voting in public refute the
claim that the First Amendment accords a right to anonymity in the
performance of an act with governmental effect. "A governmental practice that
has become general throughout the United States, and particularly one that
has the validation of long, accepted usage, bears a strong presumption of
constitutionality." McIntyre (Scalia, J., dissenting).
A
When a Washington voter signs a referendum petition subject to the PRA, he is
acting as a legislator. The Washington Constitution vests "[t]he legislative
authority" of the State in the legislature, but "the people reserve to themselves
the power . . . to approve or reject at the polls any act, item, section, or part of
any bill, act, or law passed by the legislature." Art. 2, §1. This "referendum"
power of popular legislation is exercised by submitting a petition, in accordance

Robson

602

The First Amendment

with certain specifications, to the Washington secretary of state with valid
signatures of registered voters in number equal to or exceeding four percent of
the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election. §1(b); Wash. Rev. Code
§29A.72.100, 130, 140, 150, 160 (2008).
*** Plaintiffs point to no precedent from this Court holding that legislating is
protected by the First Amendment. Nor do they identify historical evidence
demonstrating that "the freedom of speech" the First Amendment codified
encompassed a right to legislate without public disclosure. This should come as
no surprise; the exercise of lawmaking power in the United States has
traditionally been public.
*** Moreover, even when the people asked Congress for legislative changes--by
exercising their constitutional right to "to petition the Government for a redress
of grievances," U. S. Const., Amdt. 1--they did so publicly. The petition was
read aloud in Congress. The petitioner's name (when large groups were not
involved), his request, and what action Congress had taken on the petition were
consistently recorded in the House and Senate Journals. Even when the people
exercised legislative power directly, they did so not anonymously, but openly in
town hall meetings.
Petitioning the government and participating in the traditional town meeting
were precursors of the modern initiative and referendum. Those innovations
were modeled after similar devices used by the Swiss democracy in the 1800's,
and were first used in the United States by South Dakota in 1898. *** Plaintiffs'
argument implies that the public nature of these practices, so longstanding and
unquestioned, violated the freedom of speech. There is no historical support for
such a claim.
B
Legislating was not the only governmental act that was public in America.
Voting was public until 1888 when the States began to adopt the Australian
secret ballot. See Burson v. Freeman (1992) (plurality opinion). We have
acknowledged the existence of a First Amendment interest in voting, see, e.g.,
Burdick v. Takushi (1992), but we have never said that it includes the right to
vote anonymously. The history of voting in the United States completely
undermines that claim.
Initially, the Colonies mostly continued the English traditions of voting by a
show of hands or by voice--viva voce voting. ***
Any suggestion that viva voce voting infringed the accepted understanding of
the pre-existing freedom of speech to which the First Amendment's text refers is
refuted by the fact that several state constitutions that required or authorized
viva voce voting also explicitly guaranteed the freedom of speech. See, e.g., Ky.
Const., Art. X, §7, Art. VI, §16 (1799); Ill. Const., Art. VIII, §22, Art. I, §28
(1818). Surely one constitutional provision did not render the other invalid.
Of course the practice of viva voce voting was gradually replaced with the paper
ballot, which was thought to reduce fraud and undue influence. There is no
indication that the shift resulted from a sudden realization that public voting
infringed voters' freedom of speech, and the manner in which it occurred
suggests the contrary. States adopted the paper ballot at different times, and

Robson

603

The First Amendment

some States changed methods multiple times. New York's 1777 Constitution,
for example, explicitly provided for the State to switch between methods. Art. VI.
Kentucky's 1792 Constitution required paper ballots, Art. III, §2, but its 1799
Constitution required viva voce voting, Art. VI, §16. The different voting
methods simply reflected different views about how democracy should function.
One scholar described Virginia's and Kentucky's steadfast use of viva voce
voting through the Civil War as follows: "[I]n the appeal to unflinching
manliness at the polls these two states insisted still that every voter should
show at the hustings the courage of his personal conviction." Schouler,
Evolution of the American Voter, 2 THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 665, 671
(1897).
The new paper ballots did not make voting anonymous. Taking advantage of
this, political parties began printing ballots with their candidates' names on
them. They used brightly colored paper and other distinctive markings so that
the ballots could be recognized from a distance, making the votes public. Abuse
of these unofficial paper ballots was rampant. The polling place had become an
"open auction place" where votes could be freely bought or coerced. Employers
threatened employees. Party workers kept voters from the other party away
from the ballot box. Ballot peddlers paid voters and then watched them place
the ballot in the box. Thus, although some state courts said that voting by
ballot was meant to be more secret than the public act of viva voce voting; and
although some state constitutional requirements of ballot voting were held to
guarantee ballot secrecy, thus prohibiting the numbering of ballots for voter
identification purposes, in general, voting by ballot was by no means secret.
Most important of all for present purposes, I am aware of no assertion of ballot
secrecy that relied on federal or state constitutional guarantees of freedom of
speech.
It was precisely discontent over the nonsecret nature of ballot voting, and the
abuses that produced, which led to the States' adoption of the Australian secret
ballot. New York and Massachusetts began that movement in 1888, and almost
90 percent of the States had followed suit by 1896. But I am aware of no
contention that the Australian system was required by the First Amendment (or
the state counterparts). That would have been utterly implausible, since the
inhabitants of the Colonies, the States, and the United States had found public
voting entirely compatible with "the freedom of speech" for several centuries.
The long history of public legislating and voting contradicts plaintiffs' claim that
disclosure of petition signatures having legislative effect violates the First
Amendment. ***
Plaintiffs raise concerns that the disclosure of petition signatures may lead to
threats and intimidation. Of course nothing prevents the people of Washington
from keeping petition signatures secret to avoid that--just as nothing prevented
the States from moving to the secret ballot. But there is no constitutional basis
for this Court to impose that course upon the States--or to insist (as today's
opinion does) that it can only be avoided by the demonstration of a "sufficiently
important governmental interest." And it may even be a bad idea to keep
petition signatures secret. There are laws against threats and intimidation; and
harsh criticism, short of unlawful action, is a price our people have traditionally
been willing to pay for self-governance. Requiring people to stand up in public

Robson

604

The First Amendment

for their political acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is doomed.
For my part, I do not look forward to a society which, thanks to the Supreme
Court, campaigns anonymously (McIntyre) and even exercises the direct
democracy of initiative and referendum hidden from public scrutiny and
protected from the accountability of criticism. This does not resemble the Home
of the Brave.
JUSTICE THOMAS, DISSENTING.
Just as "[c]onfidence in the integrity of our electoral processes is essential to the
functioning of our participatory democracy," so too is citizen participation in
those processes, which necessarily entails political speech and association
under the First Amendment. In my view, compelled disclosure of signed
referendum and initiative petitions under the Washington Public Records Act
(PRA), severely burdens those rights and chills citizen participation in the
referendum process. Given those burdens, I would hold that Washington's
decision to subject all referendum petitions to public disclosure is
unconstitutional because there will always be a less restrictive means by which
Washington can vindicate its stated interest in preserving the integrity of its
referendum process. I respectfully dissent.
*** Because the strength of Washington's interest in transparency and a
signer's individual First Amendment interest in privacy of political association
remain constant across all referendum topics, and because less restrictive
means to protect the integrity of the referendum process are not topic specific, I
would hold that on-demand public disclosure of referendum petitions under the
PRA is not narrowly tailored for any referendum.***
Significant practical problems will result from requiring as-applied challenges to
protect referendum signers' constitutional rights. ***

Notes	  
1.
The Court’s other major anonymity cases, discussed in the above
cases, are Talley v. California (1960); Brown v. Socialist Workers Party
(1982); and Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation
(ACLF)(1999). In ACLF, the Court found a Colorado provision requiring
people circulating ballot petitions to wear identification badges
unconstitutional under the First Amendment.
2.
In McIntyre, the Court agreed that Ohio’s interest in “preventing
fraud and libel” “carries special weight during election campaigns when
false statements, if credited, may have serious adverse consequences for
the public at large,” but noted that this interest is also (and perhaps
better) served by Ohio’s Election Code that “includes detailed and specific
prohibitions against making or disseminating false statements during

The constitutionality of these Election Code
provisions were the subject of extensive litigation, reaching the United
States Supreme Court in Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 134 S. Ct.
2334, 189 L. Ed. 2d 246 (2014), in which the Court reversed the Sixth
Circuit and found the case justiciable. When the controversy returned to
the district judge, the judge subjected the Election Code provisions to
strict scrutiny and found them unconstitutional, relying in large part on
United States v. Alvarez (2012). List v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, No. 1:10CV-720, 2014 WL 4472634 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 11, 2014).
3. The concurring opinions in Doe v. Reed provide different perspectives
on how the court on remand should rule in the subsequent as-applied
challenge. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district judge
granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants and denied Doe's
motion for summary judgment, lifted the injunction that prevented the
disclosure of the R–71 petitions, and closed the case. Doe v. Reed, No.
C09-5456BHS, 2011 WL 5403218, at *1 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 8, 2011). The
Ninth Circuit thereafter dismissed an appeal as moot. Doe No. 1 v. Reed,
697 F.3d 1235 (9th Cir. 2012).

II.	   Campaign	  Finance	  	  
Understanding First Amendment challenges to campaign finance laws
can be difficult. The underlying statutory and regulatory schemes are
themselves complex.
Additionally, the approximately 20 campaign
finance cases decided by the United States Supreme Court tend to be
lengthy and closely divided with fractured opinions. Buckley v. Valeo
(1976), the first major campaign finance case, occupies almost 300 pages
in the United States Reports: approximately one third is the Court’s per
curiam opinion; one third is the Appendix consisting of the Federal
Election Campaign Act under review; and one third consists of various
opinions concurring and dissenting in part. The Court’s opinion in
McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003), considering First
Amendment challenges to the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002,
is likewise almost 300 pages in the United States Reports, 540 U.S. 93365, with a dizzying array of opinions.‡‡ The controversial Citizens United

The First Amendment

Note:	  Buckley	  v.	  Valeo	  
In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the Court considered a First Amendment
challenge to the Federal Election Campaign Act [FECA], which the per
curiam opinion described thusly:
The intricate statutory scheme adopted by Congress to regulate federal election
campaigns includes restrictions on political contributions and expenditures that
apply broadly to all phases of and all participants in the election process. The
major contribution and expenditure limitations in the Act prohibit individuals
from contributing more than $25,000 in a single year or more than $1,000 to
any single candidate for an election campaign and from spending more than
$1,000 a year "relative to a clearly identified candidate." Other provisions restrict
a candidate's use of personal and family resources in his campaign and limit the
overall amount that can be spent by a candidate in campaigning for federal
office.

The Court equated money to (pure) (political) speech. The per curiam
opinion rejected the relevancy of United States v. O’Brien:
The expenditure of money simply cannot be equated with such conduct as
destruction of a draft card. Some forms of communication made possible by the
giving and spending of money involve speech alone, some involve conduct
primarily, and some involve a combination of the two. Yet this Court has never
suggested that the dependence of a communication on the expenditure of money
operates itself to introduce a non speech element or to reduce the exacting
scrutiny required by the First Amendment.

It also rejected the applicability of “time, place, or manner” doctrine:
The critical difference between this case and those time, place, and manner
cases is that the present Act's contribution and expenditure limitations impose
direct quantity restrictions on political communication and association by
persons, groups, candidates, and political parties in addition to any reasonable
time, place, and manner regulations otherwise imposed.
A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political
communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of
expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their
exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every
means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure
of money.

Thus, the Court subjects FECA to “exacting scrutiny.” In doing so, it
establishes a divide between contributions and expenditures.
In sum, the provisions of the Act that impose a $1,000 limitation on
contributions to a single candidate, 608(b)(1), a $5,000 limitation on
contributions by a political committee to a single candidate, 608(b)(2), and a
$25,000 limitation on total contributions by an individual during any calendar
year, 608(b)(3), are constitutionally valid. These limitations, along with the
disclosure provisions, constitute the Act's primary weapons against the reality or
appearance of improper influence stemming from the dependence of candidates
on large campaign contributions. The contribution ceilings thus serve the basic
governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process

Robson

The First Amendment

without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates
to engage in political debate and discussion. By contrast, the First Amendment
requires the invalidation of the Act's independent expenditure ceiling, 608 (e) (1),
its limitation on a candidate's expenditures from his own personal funds, 608 (a),
and its ceilings on overall campaign expenditures, 608 (c). These provisions
place substantial and direct restrictions on the ability of candidates, citizens,
and associations to engage in protected political expression, restrictions that the
First Amendment cannot tolerate.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Federal law prohibits corporations and unions from using their general treasury
funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an
"electioneering communication" or for speech expressly advocating the election
or defeat of a candidate. 2 U. S. C. §441b. Limits on electioneering
communications were upheld in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n (2003).
The holding of McConnell rested to a large extent on an earlier case, Austin v.
Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990). Austin had held that political speech
may be banned based on the speaker's corporate identity.
In this case we are asked to reconsider Austin and, in effect, McConnell. It has
been noted that "Austin was a significant departure from ancient First
Amendment principles," Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,
(WRTL) (2007) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). We
agree with that conclusion and hold that stare decisis does not compel the
continued acceptance of Austin. The Government may regulate corporate
political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not
suppress that speech altogether. We turn to the case now before us.
I
A
Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation *** [with] an annual budget of about
$12 million. Most of its funds are from donations by individuals; but, in
addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds from for-profit corporations.
In January 2008, Citizens United released a film entitled Hillary: The Movie. We
refer to the film as Hillary. It is a 90-minute documentary about then-Senator

Robson

613

The First Amendment

Hillary Clinton, who was a candidate in the Democratic Party's 2008
Presidential primary elections. Hillary mentions Senator Clinton by name and
depicts interviews with political commentators and other persons, most of them
quite critical of Senator Clinton. Hillary was released in theaters and on DVD,
but Citizens United wanted to increase distribution by making it available
through video-on-demand.
Video-on-demand allows digital cable subscribers to select programming from
various menus, including movies, television shows, sports, news, and music.
The viewer can watch the program at any time and can elect to rewind or pause
the program. In December 2007, a cable company offered, for a payment of $1.2
million, to make Hillary available on a video-on-demand channel called
"Elections '08." Some video-on-demand services require viewers to pay a small
fee to view a selected program, but here the proposal was to make Hillary
available to viewers free of charge.
To implement the proposal, Citizens United was prepared to pay for the videoon-demand; and to promote the film, it produced two 10-second ads and one
30-second ad for Hillary. Each ad includes a short (and, in our view, pejorative)
statement about Senator Clinton, followed by the name of the movie and the
movie's Website address. Citizens United desired to promote the video-ondemand offering by running advertisements on broadcast and cable television.
B
Before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), federal law
prohibited--and still does prohibit--corporations and unions from using general
treasury funds to make direct contributions to candidates or independent
expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate,
through any form of media, in connection with certain qualified federal elections.
2 U. S. C. §441b (2000 ed.) BCRA §203 amended §441b to prohibit any
"electioneering communication" as well. An electioneering communication is
defined as "any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication" that "refers to a
clearly identified candidate for Federal office" and is made within 30 days of a
primary or 60 days of a general election. The Federal Election Commission's
(FEC) regulations further define an electioneering communication as a
communication that is "publicly distributed." "In the case of a candidate for
nomination for President ... publicly distributed means" that the communication
"[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary
election . . . is being held within 30 days." Corporations and unions are barred
from using their general treasury funds for express advocacy or electioneering
communications. They may establish, however, a "separate segregated fund"
(known as a political action committee, or PAC) for these purposes. The moneys
received by the segregated fund are limited to donations from stockholders and
employees of the corporation or, in the case of unions, members of the union.
C
Citizens United wanted to make Hillary available through video-on-demand
within 30 days of the 2008 primary elections. It feared, however, that both the
film and the ads would be covered by §441b's ban on corporate-funded
independent expenditures, thus subjecting the corporation to civil and criminal
penalties under §437g. In December 2007, Citizens United sought declaratory

Robson

614

The First Amendment

and injunctive relief against the FEC. It argued that (1) §441b is
unconstitutional as applied to Hillary; and (2) BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure
requirements, BCRA §§201 and 311, are unconstitutional as applied to Hillary
and to the three ads for the movie.
***
II
Before considering whether Austin should be overruled, we first address
whether Citizens United's claim that §441b cannot be applied to Hillary may be
resolved on other, narrower grounds.
***
[T]he Court cannot resolve this case on a narrower ground without chilling
political speech, speech that is central to the meaning and purpose of the First
Amendment. See Morse v. Frederick (2007). It is not judicial restraint to accept
an unsound, narrow argument just so the Court can avoid another argument
with broader implications. Indeed, a court would be remiss in performing its
duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of
making a broader ruling. Here, the lack of a valid basis for an alternative ruling
requires full consideration of the continuing effect of the speech suppression
upheld in Austin.
III
*** The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions. Section
441b makes it a felony for all corporations--including nonprofit advocacy
corporations--either to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or
to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary
election and 60 days of a general election. Thus, the following acts would all be
felonies under §441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial phase of
60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to disapprove of a
Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle
Association publishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger
because the incumbent U. S. Senator supports a handgun ban; and the
American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a
Presidential candidate in light of that candidate's defense of free speech. These
prohibitions are classic examples of censorship.
Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC
created by a corporation can still speak. See McConnell (opinion of Kennedy, J.).
A PAC is a separate association from the corporation. So the PAC exemption
from §441b's expenditure ban, §441b(b)(2), does not allow corporations to speak.
Even if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to speak--and it does not--the
option to form PACs does not alleviate the First Amendment problems with
§441b. PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and
subject to extensive regulations. For example, every PAC must appoint a
treasurer, forward donations to the treasurer promptly, keep detailed records of
the identities of the persons making donations, preserve receipts for three years,
and file an organization statement and report changes to this information
within 10 days.
And that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the
FEC, which are due at different times depending on the type of election that is

Robson

615

The First Amendment

about to occur. *** PACs have to comply with these regulations just to speak.
This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the millions of corporations in this
country have PACs. PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak. Given
the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in
time to make its views known regarding candidates and issues in a current
campaign.
Section 441b's prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban
on speech. As a "restriction on the amount of money a person or group can
spend on political communication during a campaign," that statute "necessarily
reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues
discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached."
Buckley v. Valeo (1976) (per curiam). Were the Court to uphold these restrictions,
the Government could repress speech by silencing certain voices at any of the
various points in the speech process. See McConnell (opinion of Scalia, J.)
(Government could repress speech by "attacking all levels of the production and
dissemination of ideas," for "effective public communication requires the
speaker to make use of the services of others"). If §441b applied to individuals,
no one would believe that it is merely a time, place, or manner restriction on
speech. Its purpose and effect are to silence entities whose voices the
Government deems to be suspect.
Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold
officials accountable to the people. See Buckley ("In a republic where the people
are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among
candidates for office is essential"). The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to
speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to
enlightened self-government and a necessary means to protect it. The First
Amendment " 'has its fullest and most urgent application' to speech uttered
during a campaign for political office." Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic
Central Comm. (1989) (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy (1971)); see Buckley,
("Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are
integral to the operation of the system of government established by our
Constitution").
For these reasons, political speech must prevail against laws that would
suppress it, whether by design or inadvertence. Laws that burden political
speech are "subject to strict scrutiny," which requires the Government to prove
that the restriction "furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to
achieve that interest." WRTL (opinion of Roberts, C. J.). While it might be
maintained that political speech simply cannot be banned or restricted as a
categorical matter, the quoted language from WRTL provides a sufficient
framework for protecting the relevant First Amendment interests in this case.
We shall employ it here.
Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First Amendment stands
against attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints. See, e.g., United
States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. (2000) (striking down content-based
restriction). Prohibited, too, are restrictions distinguishing among different
speakers, allowing speech by some but not others. See First Nat. Bank of Boston
v. Bellotti (1978). As instruments to censor, these categories are interrelated:

Robson

616

The First Amendment

Speech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker are all too often simply
a means to control content.
Quite apart from the purpose or effect of regulating content, moreover, the
Government may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies
certain preferred speakers. By taking the right to speak from some and giving it
to others, the Government deprives the disadvantaged person or class of the
right to use speech to strive to establish worth, standing, and respect for the
speaker's voice. The Government may not by these means deprive the public of
the right and privilege to determine for itself what speech and speakers are
worthy of consideration. The First Amendment protects speech and speaker,
and the ideas that flow from each. *** [I]t is inherent in the nature of the
political process that voters must be free to obtain information from diverse
sources in order to determine how to cast their votes. At least before Austin, the
Court had not allowed the exclusion of a class of speakers from the general
public dialogue.
We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context of political speech, the
Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers. Both
history and logic lead us to this conclusion.
A
1
The Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to
corporations. Bellotti (citing Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro (1977); Time,
Inc. v. Firestone (1976); Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc. (1975); Southeastern Promotions,
Ltd. v. Conrad (1975); Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn (1975); Miami Herald
Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974); New York Times Co. v. United States (1971) (per
curiam); Time, Inc. v. Hill (1967); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964); Kingsley
Int'l Pictures Corp. v. Regents of Univ. of N. Y. (1959); Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v.
Wilson (1952)); see, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC (1997); Denver
Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC (1996); Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC (1994); Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims
Board (1991); Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC (1989); Florida Star v.
B. J. F. (1989); Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps (1986); Landmark
Communications, Inc. v. Virginia (1978); Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc.,
(1976); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., (1974); Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing
Assn., Inc. v. Bresler (1970).
This protection has been extended by explicit holdings to the context of political
speech. See, e.g., NAACP v. Button (1963); Grosjean v. American Press Co. (1936).
Under the rationale of these precedents, political speech does not lose First
Amendment protection "simply because its source is a corporation." Bellotti
("The identity of the speaker is not decisive in determining whether speech is
protected. Corporations and other associations, like individuals, contribute to
the 'discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas' that
the First Amendment seeks to foster"). The Court has thus rejected the
argument that political speech of corporations or other associations should be
treated differently under the First Amendment simply because such
associations are not "natural persons."
***

Robson

617

The First Amendment

B
The Court is thus confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a pre-Austin
line that forbids restrictions on political speech based on the speaker's
corporate identity and a post-Austin line that permits them. No case before
Austin had held that Congress could prohibit independent expenditures for
political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity. Before Austin
Congress had enacted legislation for this purpose, and the Government urged
the same proposition before this Court. In neither of these cases did the Court
adopt the proposition.
In its defense of the corporate-speech restrictions in §441b, the Government
notes the antidistortion rationale on which Austin and its progeny rest in part,
yet it all but abandons reliance upon it. It argues instead that two other
compelling interests support Austin's holding that corporate expenditure
restrictions are constitutional: an anticorruption interest and a shareholderprotection interest. We consider the three points in turn.
1
As for Austin's antidistortion rationale, the Government does little to defend it.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-48 (Sept. 9, 2009). And with good reason, for the
rationale cannot support §441b.
If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or
jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political
speech. If the antidistortion rationale were to be accepted, however, it would
permit Government to ban political speech simply because the speaker is an
association that has taken on the corporate form. The Government contends
that Austin permits it to ban corporate expenditures for almost all forms of
communication stemming from a corporation. If Austin were correct, the
Government could prohibit a corporation from expressing political views in
media beyond those presented here, such as by printing books. The
Government responds "that the FEC has never applied this statute to a book,"
and if it did, "there would be quite [a] good as-applied challenge." This troubling
assertion of brooding governmental power cannot be reconciled with the
confidence and stability in civic discourse that the First Amendment must
secure.
*** Austin's antidistortion rationale would produce the dangerous, and
unacceptable, consequence that Congress could ban political speech of media
corporations.
*** When Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to
command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted
source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought. This is
unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.
2
What we have said also shows the invalidity of other arguments made by the
Government. For the most part relinquishing the antidistortion rationale, the

Robson

618

The First Amendment

Government falls back on the argument that corporate political speech can be
banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance.
***
The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the
electorate to lose faith in our democracy. By definition, an independent
expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not
coordinated with a candidate. See Buckley. The fact that a corporation, or any
other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes
that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials. This is
inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse " 'to take part in
democratic governance' " because of additional political speech made by a
corporation or any other speaker. McConnell.
Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), is not to the contrary. Caperton held
that a judge was required to recuse himself "when a person with a personal
stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in
placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge's election
campaign when the case was pending or imminent." The remedy of recusal was
based on a litigant's due process right to a fair trial before an unbiased judge.
Caperton's holding was limited to the rule that the judge must be recused, not
that the litigant's political speech could be banned. ***
3
The Government contends further that corporate independent expenditures can
be limited because of its interest in protecting dissenting shareholders from
being compelled to fund corporate political speech. This asserted interest, like
Austin's antidistortion rationale, would allow the Government to ban the
political speech even of media corporations. Assume, for example, that a
shareholder of a corporation that owns a newspaper disagrees with the political
views the newspaper expresses. Under the Government's view, that potential
disagreement could give the Government the authority to restrict the media
corporation's political speech. The First Amendment does not allow that power.
There is, furthermore, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by
shareholders "through the procedures of corporate democracy." Bellotti.
Those reasons are sufficient to reject this shareholder-protection interest; and,
moreover, the statute is both underinclusive and overinclusive. As to the first, if
Congress had been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders, it would not
have banned corporate speech in only certain media within 30 or 60 days before
an election. A dissenting shareholder's interests would be implicated by speech
in any media at any time. As to the second, the statute is overinclusive because
it covers all corporations, including nonprofit corporations and for-profit
corporations with only single shareholders. As to other corporations, the
remedy is not to restrict speech but to consider and explore other regulatory
mechanisms. The regulatory mechanism here, based on speech, contravenes
the First Amendment.
4
We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling
interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our

Robson

619

The First Amendment

Nation's political process. Cf. 2 U. S. C. §441e (contribution and expenditure
ban applied to "foreign national[s]"). Section 441b is not limited to corporations
or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominately
by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we
assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting
foreign influence over our political process. ***
C
***
Due consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin should be and now is
overruled. We return to the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the
Government may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker's
corporate identity. No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the
political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.
JUSTICE STEVENS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, AND JUSTICE
SOTOMAYOR JOIN, CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART.
The real issue in this case concerns how, not if, the appellant may finance its
electioneering. Citizens United is a wealthy nonprofit corporation that runs a
political action committee (PAC) with millions of dollars in assets. Under the
Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), it could have used those
assets to televise and promote Hillary: The Movie wherever and whenever it
wanted to. It also could have spent unrestricted sums to broadcast Hillary at
any time other than the 30 days before the last primary election. Neither
Citizens United's nor any other corporation's speech has been "banned." All that
the parties dispute is whether Citizens United had a right to use the funds in its
general treasury to pay for broadcasts during the 30-day period. The notion
that the First Amendment dictates an affirmative answer to that question is, in
my judgment, profoundly misguided. Even more misguided is the notion that
the Court must rewrite the law relating to campaign expenditures by for-profit
corporations and unions to decide this case.
The basic premise underlying the Court's ruling is its iteration, and constant
reiteration, of the proposition that the First Amendment bars regulatory
distinctions based on a speaker's identity, including its "identity" as a
corporation. While that glittering generality has rhetorical appeal, it is not a
correct statement of the law. Nor does it tell us when a corporation may engage
in electioneering that some of its shareholders oppose. It does not even resolve
the specific question whether Citizens United may be required to finance some
of its messages with the money in its PAC. The conceit that corporations must
be treated identically to natural persons in the political sphere is not only
inaccurate but also inadequate to justify the Court's disposition of this case.
In the context of election to public office, the distinction between corporate and
human speakers is significant. Although they make enormous contributions to
our society, corporations are not actually members of it. They cannot vote or
run for office. Because they may be managed and controlled by nonresidents,
their interests may conflict in fundamental respects with the interests of eligible
voters. The financial resources, legal structure, and instrumental orientation of
corporations raise legitimate concerns about their role in the electoral process.

I regret the length of what follows, but the importance and novelty of the

I emphatically dissent from its principal holding.

The Court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions
across the Nation. The path it has taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do
damage to this institution. Before turning to the question whether to overrule
Austin and part of McConnell, it is important to explain why the Court should
not be deciding that question.

Today's decision is backwards in many senses. It elevates the majority's agenda
over the litigants' submissions, facial attacks over as-applied claims, broad
constitutional theories over narrow statutory grounds, individual dissenting
opinions over precedential holdings, assertion over tradition, absolutism over
empiricism, rhetoric over reality. Our colleagues have arrived at the conclusion
that Austin must be overruled and that §203 is facially unconstitutional only
after mischaracterizing both the reach and rationale of those authorities, and
after bypassing or ignoring rules of judicial restraint used to cabin the Court's
lawmaking power. Their conclusion that the societal interest in avoiding
corruption and the appearance of corruption does not provide an adequate
justification for regulating corporate expenditures on candidate elections relies
on an incorrect description of that interest, along with a failure to acknowledge
the relevance of established facts and the considered judgments of state and
federal legislatures over many decades.
In a democratic society, the longstanding consensus on the need to limit
corporate campaign spending should outweigh the wooden application of judgemade rules. The majority's rejection of this principle "elevate[s] corporations to a
level of deference which has not been seen at least since the days when
substantive due process was regularly used to invalidate regulatory legislation
thought to unfairly impinge upon established economic interests." Bellotti
(White, J., dissenting). At bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the
common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent
corporations from undermining self-government since the founding, and who
have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate
electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to
repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is imperfect, few
outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a
dearth of corporate money in politics.
I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, ANNOUNCED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT AND DELIVERED
AN OPINION, IN WHICH JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY, AND JUSTICE ALITO JOIN.
There is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in
electing our political leaders. Citizens can exercise that right in a variety of
ways: They can run for office themselves, vote, urge others to vote for a
particular candidate, volunteer to work on a campaign, and contribute to a
candidate's campaign. This case is about the last of those options.
The right to participate in democracy through political contributions is
protected by the First Amendment, but that right is not absolute. Our cases
have held that Congress may regulate campaign contributions to protect
against corruption or the appearance of corruption. See, e.g., Buckley v. Valeo
(1976) (per curiam). At the same time, we have made clear that Congress may
not regulate contributions simply to reduce the amount of money in politics, or
to restrict the political participation of some in order to enhance the relative
influence of others. See, e.g., Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v.
Bennett (2011).
Many people might find those latter objectives attractive: They would be
delighted to see fewer television commercials touting a candidate's
accomplishments or disparaging an opponent's character. Money in politics
may at times seem repugnant to some, but so too does much of what the First
Amendment vigorously protects. If the First Amendment protects flag burning,
funeral protests, and Nazi parades—despite the profound offense such
spectacles cause—it surely protects political campaign speech despite popular
opposition. See Texas v. Johnson (1989); Snyder v. Phelps (2011); National
Socialist Party of America v. Skokie (1977) (per curiam). Indeed, as we have
emphasized, the First Amendment "has its fullest and most urgent application
precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office." Monitor Patriot Co. v.
Roy (1971).
In a series of cases over the past 40 years, we have spelled out how to draw the
constitutional line between the permissible goal of avoiding corruption in the
political process and the impermissible desire simply to limit political speech.
We have said that government regulation may not target the general gratitude a
candidate may feel toward those who support him or his allies, or the political
access such support may afford. "Ingratiation and access. . . are not
corruption." Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n (2010). They embody a
central feature of democracy—that constituents support candidates who share
their beliefs and interests, and candidates who are elected can be expected to
be responsive to those concerns.

Robson

622

The First Amendment

Any regulation must instead target what we have called "quid pro quo"
corruption or its appearance. See id. That Latin phrase captures the notion of a
direct exchange of an official act for money. See McCormick v. United States
(1991). "The hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for
political favors." Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action
Comm. (1985). Campaign finance restrictions that pursue other objectives, we
have explained, impermissibly inject the Government "into the debate over who
should govern." Bennett. And those who govern should be the last people to help
decide who should govern.
The statute at issue in this case imposes two types of limits on campaign
contributions. The first, called base limits, restricts how much money a donor
may contribute to a particular candidate or committee. 2 U. S. C. §441a(a)(1).
The second, called aggregate limits, restricts how much money a donor may
contribute in total to all candidates or committees. §441a(a)(3).
This case does not involve any challenge to the base limits, which we have
previously upheld as serving the permissible objective of combatting corruption.
The Government contends that the aggregate limits also serve that objective, by
preventing circumvention of the base limits. We conclude, however, that the
aggregate limits do little, if anything, to address that concern, while seriously
restricting participation in the democratic process. The aggregate limits are
therefore invalid under the First Amendment.
I
A
For the 2013-2014 election cycle, the base limits in the Federal Election
Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), as amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform
Act of 2002 (BCRA), permit an individual to contribute up to $2,600 per election
to a candidate ($5,200 total for the primary and general elections); $32,400 per
year to a national party committee; $10,000 per year to a state or local party
committee; and $5,000 per year to a political action committee, or "PAC." 2 U. S.
C. §441a(a)(1); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532 (2013). A national committee, state or local
party committee, or multicandidate PAC may in turn contribute up to $5,000
per election to a candidate. §441a(a)(2).
The base limits apply with equal force to contributions that are "in any way
earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or conduit" to a
candidate. §441a(a)(8). If, for example, a donor gives money to a party
committee but directs the party committee to pass the contribution along to a
particular candidate, then the transaction is treated as a contribution from the
original donor to the specified candidate.
For the 2013-2014 election cycle, the aggregate limits in BCRA permit an
individual to contribute a total of $48,600 to federal candidates and a total of
$74,600 to other political committees. Of that $74,600, only $48,600 may be
contributed to state or local party committees and PACs, as opposed to national
party committees. §441a(a)(3); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532. All told, an individual may
contribute up to $123,200 to candidate and noncandidate committees during
each two-year election cycle.
The base limits thus restrict how much money a donor may contribute to any
particular candidate or committee; the aggregate limits have the effect of

Robson

623

The First Amendment

restricting how many candidates or committees the donor may support, to the
extent permitted by the base limits.
B
In the 2011-2012 election cycle, appellant Shaun McCutcheon contributed a
total of $33,088 to 16 different federal candidates, in compliance with the base
limits applicable to each. He alleges that he wished to contribute $1,776 to each
of 12 additional candidates but was prevented from doing so by the aggregate
limit on contributions to candidates. McCutcheon also contributed a total of
$27,328 to several noncandidate political committees, in compliance with the
base limits applicable to each. He alleges that he wished to contribute to
various other political committees, including $25,000 to each of the three
Republican national party committees, but was prevented from doing so by the
aggregate limit on contributions to political committees. McCutcheon further
alleges that he plans to make similar contributions in the future. In the 20132014 election cycle, he again wishes to contribute at least $60,000 to various
candidates and $75,000 to non-candidate political committees.
Appellant Republican National Committee is a national political party
committee charged with the general management of the Republican Party. The
RNC wishes to receive the contributions that McCutcheon and similarly
situated individuals would like to make—contributions otherwise permissible
under the base limits for national party committees but foreclosed by the
aggregate limit on contributions to political committees.
In June 2012, McCutcheon and the RNC filed a complaint before a three-judge
panel of the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia. McCutcheon and
the RNC asserted that the aggregate limits on contributions to candidates and
to noncandidate political committees were unconstitutional under the First
Amendment. They moved for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of
the challenged provisions, and the Government moved to dismiss the case.
The three-judge District Court denied appellants' motion for a preliminary
injunction and granted the Government's motion to dismiss. Assuming that the
base limits appropriately served the Government's anticorruption interest, the
District Court concluded that the aggregate limits survived First Amendment
scrutiny because they prevented evasion of the base limits.
In particular, the District Court imagined a hypothetical scenario that might
occur in a world without aggregate limits. A single donor might contribute the
maximum amount under the base limits to nearly 50 separate committees,
each of which might then transfer the money to the same single committee.
That committee, in turn, might use all the transferred money for coordinated
expenditures on behalf of a particular candidate, allowing the single donor to
circumvent the base limit on the amount he may contribute to that candidate.
The District Court acknowledged that "it may seem unlikely that so many
separate entities would willingly serve as conduits" for the single donor's
interests, but it concluded that such a scenario "is not hard to imagine." It
thus rejected a constitutional challenge to the aggregate limits, characterizing
the base limits and the aggregate limits "as a coherent system rather than
merely a collection of individual limits stacking prophylaxis upon prophylaxis."

Robson

The First Amendment

McCutcheon and the RNC appealed directly to this Court, as authorized by law.
In such a case, "we ha[ve] no discretion to refuse adjudication of the case on its
merits," and accordingly we noted probable jurisdiction.
II
A
Buckley v. Valeo presented this Court with its first opportunity to evaluate the
constitutionality of the original contribution and expenditure limits set forth in
FECA. FECA imposed a $1,000 per election base limit on contributions from an
individual to a federal candidate. It also imposed a $25,000 per year aggregate
limit on all contributions from an individual to candidates or political
committees. 18 U. S. C. §§608(b)(1), 608(b)(3) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). On the
expenditures side, FECA imposed limits on both independent expenditures and
candidates' overall campaign expenditures. §§608(e)(1), 608(c).
Buckley recognized that "contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an
area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities." But it distinguished
expenditure limits from contribution limits based on the degree to which each
encroaches upon protected First Amendment interests. Expenditure limits, the
Court explained, "necessarily reduce[] the quantity of expression by restricting
the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of
the audience reached." The Court thus subjected expenditure limits to "the
exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations on core First Amendment rights of
political expression." Under exacting scrutiny, the Government may regulate
protected speech only if such regulation promotes a compelling interest and is
the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest.
By contrast, the Court concluded that contribution limits impose a lesser
restraint on political speech because they "permit[] the symbolic expression of
support evidenced by a contribution but do[] not in any way infringe the
contributor's freedom to discuss candidates and issues." Buckley. As a result,
the Court focused on the effect of the contribution limits on the freedom of
political association and applied a lesser but still "rigorous standard of review."
Id. Under that standard, "[e]ven a `"significant interference" with protected
rights of political association' may be sustained if the State demonstrates a
sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid
unnecessary abridgement of associational freedoms." Id.
The primary purpose of FECA was to limit quid pro quo corruption and its
appearance; that purpose satisfied the requirement of a "sufficiently important"
governmental interest. As for the "closely drawn" component, Buckley
concluded that the $1,000 base limit "focuses precisely on the problem of large
campaign contributions. . . while leaving persons free to engage in independent
political expression, to associate actively through volunteering their services,
and to assist to a limited but nonetheless substantial extent in supporting
candidates and committees with financial resources." Id. The Court therefore
upheld the $1,000 base limit under the "closely drawn" test.
The Court next separately considered an overbreadth challenge to the base limit.
The challengers argued that the base limit was fatally overbroad because most
large donors do not seek improper influence over legislators' actions. Although
the Court accepted that premise, it nevertheless rejected the overbreadth

Robson

625

The First Amendment

challenge for two reasons: First, it was too "difficult to isolate suspect
contributions" based on a contributor's subjective intent. Second, "Congress
was justified in concluding that the interest in safeguarding against the
appearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent in
the process of raising large monetary contributions be eliminated."
Finally, in one paragraph of its 139-page opinion, the Court turned to the
$25,000 aggregate limit under FECA. As a preliminary matter, it noted that the
constitutionality of the aggregate limit "ha[d] not been separately addressed at
length by the parties." Then, in three sentences, the Court disposed of any
constitutional objections to the aggregate limit that the challengers might have
had:
"The overall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the
number of candidates and committees with which an individual may
associate himself by means of financial support. But this quite modest
restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the
$1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise
contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through
the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to
contribute to that candidate, or huge contributions to the candidate's
political party. The limited, additional restriction on associational
freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus no more than a corollary of
the basic individual contribution limitation that we have found to be
constitutionally valid."
B
1
The parties and amici curiae spend significant energy debating whether the line
that Buckley drew between contributions and expenditures should remain the
law. Notwithstanding the robust debate, we see no need in this case to revisit
Buckley's distinction between contributions and expenditures and the corollary
distinction in the applicable standards of review. Buckley held that the
Government's interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance
was "sufficiently important"; we have elsewhere stated that the same interest
may properly be labeled "compelling," see National Conservative Political Action
Comm., so that the interest would satisfy even strict scrutiny. Moreover,
regardless whether we apply strict scrutiny or Buckley's "closely drawn" test, we
must assess the fit between the stated governmental objective and the means
selected to achieve that objective. See,e.g., National Conservative Political Action
Comm.; Randall v. Sorrell (2006) (opinion of Breyer, J.). Or to put it another way,
if a law that restricts political speech does not "avoid unnecessary abridgement"
of First Amendment rights, Buckley, it cannot survive "rigorous" review.
Because we find a substantial mismatch between the Government's stated
objective and the means selected to achieve it, the aggregate limits fail even
under the "closely drawn" test. We therefore need not parse the differences
between the two standards in this case.

Buckley treated the constitutionality of the $25,000 aggregate limit as
contingent upon that limit's ability to prevent circumvention of the $1,000 base

Robson

626

The First Amendment

limit, describing the aggregate limit as "no more than a corollary" of the base
limit. The Court determined that circumvention could occur when an individual
legally contributes "massive amounts of money to a particular candidate
through the use of unearmarked contributions" to entities that are themselves
likely to contribute to the candidate. For that reason, the Court upheld the
$25,000 aggregate limit.
Although Buckley provides some guidance, we think that its ultimate
conclusion about the constitutionality of the aggregate limit in place under
FECA does not control here. Buckley spent a total of three sentences analyzing
that limit; in fact, the opinion pointed out that the constitutionality of the
aggregate limit "ha[d] not been separately addressed at length by the parties."
We are now asked to address appellants' direct challenge to the aggregate limits
in place under BCRA. BCRA is a different statutory regime, and the aggregate
limits it imposes operate against a distinct legal backdrop.
Most notably, statutory safeguards against circumvention have been
considerably strengthened since Buckley was decided, through both statutory
additions and the introduction of a comprehensive regulatory scheme. With
more targeted anticircumvention measures in place today, the indiscriminate
aggregate limits under BCRA appear particularly heavy-handed.
The 1976 FECA Amendments, for example, added another layer of base
contribution limits. The 1974 version of FECA had already capped
contributions from political committees to candidates, but the 1976 version
added limits on contributions to political committees. This change was enacted
at least "in part to prevent circumvention of the very limitations on
contributions that this Court upheld in Buckley." California Medical Assn. v.
Federal Election Comm'n (1981) (plurality opinion); see also id., (Blackmun, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Because a donor's
contributions to a political committee are now limited, a donor cannot flood the
committee with "huge" amounts of money so that each contribution the
committee makes is perceived as a contribution from him. Buckley, supra, at 38.
Rather, the donor may contribute only $5,000 to the committee, which hardly
raises the specter of abuse that concerned the Court in Buckley. Limits on
contributions to political committees consequently create an additional hurdle
for a donor who seeks both to channel a large amount of money to a particular
candidate and to ensure that he gets the credit for doing so.
The 1976 Amendments also added an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors
from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees. See 2 U. S.
C. §441a(a)(5); 11 CFR §100.5(g)(4). The Government acknowledges that this
antiproliferation rule "forecloses what would otherwise be a particularly easy
and effective means of circumventing the limits on contributions to any
particular political committee." In effect, the rule eliminates a donor's ability to
create and use his own political committees to direct funds in excess of the
individual base limits. It thus blocks a straightforward method of achieving the
circumvention that was the underlying concern in Buckley.
The intricate regulatory scheme that the Federal Election Commission has
enacted since Buckley further limits the opportunities for circumvention of the
base limits via "unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to

Robson

627

The First Amendment

contribute" to a particular candidate. Although the earmarking provision was in
place when Buckley was decided, the FEC has since added regulations that
define earmarking broadly. For example, the regulations construe earmarking
to include any designation, "whether direct or indirect, express or implied, oral
or written." 11 CFR §110.6(b)(1). The regulations specify that an individual who
has contributed to a particular candidate may not also contribute to a singlecandidate committee for that candidate. §110.1(h)(1). Nor may an individual
who has contributed to a candidate also contribute to a political committee that
has supported or anticipates supporting the same candidate, if the individual
knows that "a substantial portion [of his contribution] will be contributed to, or
expended on behalf of," that candidate. §110.1(h)(2).
In addition to accounting for statutory and regulatory changes in the campaign
finance arena, appellants' challenge raises distinct legal arguments that
Buckley did not consider. For example, presumably because of its cursory
treatment of the $25,000 aggregate limit, Buckley did not separately address an
overbreadth challenge with respect to that provision. The Court rejected such a
challenge to the base limits because of the difficulty of isolating suspect
contributions. The propriety of large contributions to individual candidates
turned on the subjective intent of donors, and the Court concluded that there
was no way to tell which donors sought improper influence over legislators'
actions. The aggregate limit, on the other hand, was upheld as an
anticircumvention measure, without considering whether it was possible to
discern which donations might be used to circumvent the base limits. The
Court never addressed overbreadth in the specific context of aggregate limits,
where such an argument has far more force.
Given the foregoing, this case cannot be resolved merely by pointing to three
sentences in Buckley that were written without the benefit of full briefing or
argument on the issue. We are confronted with a different statute and different
legal arguments, at a different point in the development of campaign finance
regulation. Appellants' substantial First Amendment challenge to the system of
aggregate limits currently in place thus merits our plenary consideration.
III
The First Amendment "is designed and intended to remove governmental
restraints from the arena of public discussion, putting the decision as to what
views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us, . . . in the belief that
no other approach would comport with the premise of individual dignity and
choice upon which our political system rests." Cohen v. California (1971). As
relevant here, the First Amendment safeguards an individual's right to
participate in the public debate through political expression and political
association. See Buckley. When an individual contributes money to a candidate,
he exercises both of those rights: The contribution "serves as a general
expression of support for the candidate and his views" and "serves to affiliate a
person with a candidate." Id.
Those First Amendment rights are important regardless whether the individual
is, on the one hand, a "lone pamphleteer[] or street corner orator[] in the Tom
Paine mold," or is, on the other, someone who spends "substantial amounts of
money in order to communicate [his] political ideas through sophisticated"
means. National Conservative Political Action Comm. Either way, he is

Robson

628

The First Amendment

participating in an electoral debate that we have recognized is "integral to the
operation of the system of government established by our Constitution."
Buckley.
Buckley acknowledged that aggregate limits at least diminish an individual's
right of political association. As the Court explained, the "overall $25,000
ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and
committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of
financial support." But the Court characterized that restriction as a "quite
modest restraint upon protected political activity." We cannot agree with that
characterization. An aggregate limit on how many candidates and committees
an individual may support through contributions is not a "modest restraint" at
all. The Government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a
donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may
endorse.
To put it in the simplest terms, the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from
fully contributing to the primary and general election campaigns of ten or more
candidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits Congress views
as adequate to protect against corruption. The individual may give up to $5,200
each to nine candidates, but the aggregate limits constitute an outright ban on
further contributions to any other candidate (beyond the additional $1,800 that
may be spent before reaching the $48,600 aggregate limit). At that point, the
limits deny the individual all ability to exercise his expressive and associational
rights by contributing to someone who will advocate for his policy preferences.
A donor must limit the number of candidates he supports, and may have to
choose which of several policy concerns he will advance—clear First
Amendment harms that the dissent never acknowledges.
It is no answer to say that the individual can simply contribute less money to
more people. To require one person to contribute at lower levels than others
because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to impose a special
burden on broader participation in the democratic process. And as we have
recently admonished, the Government may not penalize an individual for
"robustly exercis[ing]" his First Amendment rights. Davis v. Federal Election
Comm'n (2008).
The First Amendment burden is especially great for individuals who do not have
ready access to alternative avenues for supporting their preferred politicians
and policies. In the context of base contribution limits, Buckley observed that a
supporter could vindicate his associational interests by personally volunteering
his time and energy on behalf of a candidate. Such personal volunteering is not
a realistic alternative for those who wish to support a wide variety of candidates
or causes. Other effective methods of supporting preferred candidates or causes
without contributing money are reserved for a select few, such as entertainers
capable of raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single evening.
The dissent faults this focus on "the individual's right to engage in political
speech," saying that it fails to take into account "the public's interest" in
"collective speech." (opinion of BREYER, J). This "collective" interest is said to
promote "a government where laws reflect the very thoughts, views, ideas, and
sentiments, the expression of which the First Amendment protects."

Robson

629

The First Amendment

But there are compelling reasons not to define the boundaries of the First
Amendment by reference to such a generalized conception of the public good.
First, the dissent's "collective speech" reflected in laws is of course the will of
the majority, and plainly can include laws that restrict free speech. The whole
point of the First Amendment is to afford individuals protection against such
infringements. The First Amendment does not protect the government, even
when the government purports to act through legislation reflecting "collective
speech." Cf. United States v. Alvarez, (2012); Wooley v. Maynard (1977); West
Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943).
Second, the degree to which speech is protected cannot turn on a legislative or
judicial determination that particular speech is useful to the democratic
process. The First Amendment does not contemplate such "ad hoc balancing of
relative social costs and benefits." United States v. Stevens (2010); see also
United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. (2000) ("What the
Constitution says is that" value judgments "are for the individual to make, not
for the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority").
Third, our established First Amendment analysis already takes account of any
"collective" interest that may justify restrictions on individual speech. Under
that accepted analysis, such restrictions are measured against the asserted
public interest (usually framed as an important or compelling governmental
interest). As explained below, we do not doubt the compelling nature of the
"collective" interest in preventing corruption in the electoral process. But we
permit Congress to pursue that interest only so long as it does not
unnecessarily infringe an individual's right to freedom of speech; we do not
truncate this tailoring test at the outset.
IV
A
With the significant First Amendment costs for individual citizens in mind, we
turn to the governmental interests asserted in this case. This Court has
identified only one legitimate governmental interest for restricting campaign
finances: preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption. See Davis;
National Conservative Political Action Comm. We have consistently rejected
attempts to suppress campaign speech based on other legislative objectives. No
matter how desirable it may seem, it is not an acceptable governmental
objective to "level the playing field," or to "level electoral opportunities," or to
"equaliz[e] the financial resources of candidates." Bennett; Davis; Buckley. The
First Amendment prohibits such legislative attempts to "fine-tun[e]" the
electoral process, no matter how well intentioned. Bennett.
As we framed the relevant principle in Buckley, "the concept that government
may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the
relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment." The dissent's
suggestion that Buckley supports the opposite proposition, simply ignores what
Buckley actually said on the matter. See also Citizens Against Rent
Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley (1981) ("Buckley. . . made clear
that contributors cannot be protected from the possibility that others will make
larger contributions").

Robson

630

The First Amendment

Moreover, while preventing corruption or its appearance is a legitimate objective,
Congress may target only a specific type of corruption—"quid pro quo"
corruption. As Buckley explained, Congress may permissibly seek to rein in
"large contributions [that] are given to secure a political quid pro quo from
current and potential office holders." In addition to "actual quid pro quo
arrangements," Congress may permissibly limit "the appearance of corruption
stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a
regime of large individual financial contributions" to particular candidates. see
also Citizens United ("When Buckley identified a sufficiently important
governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption,
that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption").
Spending large sums of money in connection with elections, but not in
connection with an effort to control the exercise of an officeholder's official
duties, does not give rise to such quid pro quo corruption. Nor does the
possibility that an individual who spends large sums may garner "influence over
or access to" elected officials or political parties. And because the Government's
interest in preventing the appearance of corruption is equally confined to the
appearance of quid pro quo corruption, the Government may not seek to limit
the appearance of mere influence or access. See Citizens United.
The dissent advocates a broader conception of corruption, and would apply the
label to any individual contributions above limits deemed necessary to protect
"collective speech." Thus, under the dissent's view, it is perfectly fine to
contribute $5,200 to nine candidates but somehow corrupt to give the same
amount to a tenth.
It is fair to say, as Justice Stevens has, "that we have not always spoken about
corruption in a clear or consistent voice." Citizens United (opinion concurring in
part and dissenting in part). The definition of corruption that we apply today,
however, has firm roots in Buckley itself. The Court in that case upheld base
contribution limits because they targeted "the danger of actual quid pro quo
arrangements" and "the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from
public awareness" of such a system of unchecked direct contributions. Buckley
simultaneously rejected limits on spending that was less likely to "be given as a
quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate." In any event, this
case is not the first in which the debate over the proper breadth of the
Government's anticorruption interest has been engaged.
The line between quid pro quo corruption and general influence may seem vague
at times, but the distinction must be respected in order to safeguard basic First
Amendment rights. In addition, "[i]n drawing that line, the First Amendment
requires us to err on the side of protecting political speech rather than
suppressing it." Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life (2007)
(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.).
The dissent laments that our opinion leaves only remnants of FECA and BCRA
that are inadequate to combat corruption. Such rhetoric ignores the fact that
we leave the base limits undisturbed. Those base limits remain the primary
means of regulating campaign contributions—the obvious explanation for why
the aggregate limits received a scant few sentences of attention in Buckley.

Robson

631

The First Amendment

B
"When the Government restricts speech, the Government bears the burden of
proving the constitutionality of its actions." Here, the Government seeks to
carry that burden by arguing that the aggregate limits further the permissible
objective of preventing quid pro quo corruption.
The difficulty is that once the aggregate limits kick in, they ban all
contributions of any amount. But Congress's selection of a $5,200 base limit
indicates its belief that contributions of that amount or less do not create a
cognizable risk of corruption. If there is no corruption concern in giving nine
candidates up to $5,200 each, it is difficult to understand how a tenth
candidate can be regarded as corruptible if given $1,801, and all others
corruptible if given a dime. And if there is no risk that additional candidates will
be corrupted by donations of up to $5,200, then the Government must defend
the aggregate limits by demonstrating that they prevent circumvention of the
base limits.
The problem is that they do not serve that function in any meaningful way. In
light of the various statutes and regulations currently in effect, Buckley's fear
that an individual might "contribute massive amounts of money to a particular
candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions" to entities likely to
support the candidate is far too speculative. And— importantly—we "have never
accepted mere conjecture as adequate to carry a First Amendment burden."
Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC (2000).
As an initial matter, there is not the same risk of quid pro quo corruption or its
appearance when money flows through independent actors to a candidate, as
when a donor contributes to a candidate directly. ***
Buckley nonetheless focused on the possibility that "unearmarked
contributions" could eventually find their way to a candidate's coffers. Even
accepting the validity of Buckley's circumvention theory, it is hard to see how a
candidate today could receive a "massive amount[] of money" that could be
traced back to a particular contributor uninhibited by the aggregate limits. The
Government offers a series of scenarios in support of that possibility. But each
is sufficiently implausible that the Government has not carried its burden of
demonstrating that the aggregate limits further its anticircumvention interest.
The primary example of circumvention, in one form or another, envisions an
individual donor who contributes the maximum amount under the base limits
to a particular candidate, say, Representative Smith. Then the donor also
channels "massive amounts of money" to Smith through a series of
contributions to PACs that have stated their intention to support Smith.
Various earmarking and antiproliferation rules disarm this example.
Importantly, the donor may not contribute to the most obvious PACs: those that
support only Smith. Nor may the donor contribute to the slightly less obvious
PACs that he knows will route "a substantial portion" of his contribution to
Smith.
The donor must instead turn to other PACs that are likely to give to Smith.
When he does so, however, he discovers that his contribution will be
significantly diluted by all the contributions from others to the same PACs.

Robson

The First Amendment

After all, the donor cannot give more than $5,000 to a PAC and so cannot
dominate the PAC's total receipts, as he could when Buckley was decided. He
cannot retain control over his contribution, direct his money "in any way" to
Smith, or even imply that he would like his money to be recontributed to Smith.
His salience as a Smith supporter has been diminished, and with it the
potential for corruption.
It is not clear how many candidates a PAC must support before our dedicated
donor can avoid being tagged with the impermissible knowledge that "a
substantial portion" of his contribution will go to Smith. But imagine that the
donor is one of ten equal donors to a PAC that gives the highest possible
contribution to Smith. The PAC may give no more than $2,600 per election to
Smith. Of that sum, just $260 will be attributable to the donor intent on
circumventing the base limits. Thus far he has hardly succeeded in funneling
"massive amounts of money" to Smith. Buckley.
But what if this donor does the same thing via, say, 100 different PACs? His
$260 contribution will balloon to $26,000, ten times what he may contribute
directly to Smith in any given election.
This 100-PAC scenario is highly implausible. In the first instance, it is not true
that the individual donor will necessarily have access to a sufficient number of
PACs to effectuate such a scheme. There are many PACs, but they are not
limitless. For the 2012 election cycle, the FEC reported about 2,700
nonconnected PACs (excluding PACs that finance independent expenditures
only). And not every PAC that supports Smith will work in this scheme: For our
donor's pro rata share of a PAC's contribution to Smith to remain meaningful,
the PAC must be funded by only a small handful of donors. The
antiproliferation rules, which were not in effect when Buckley was decided,
prohibit our donor from creating 100 pro-Smith PACs of his own, or
collaborating with the nine other donors to do so. See 2 U. S. C. §441a(a)(5) ("all
contributions made by political committees established or financed or
maintained or controlled by . . . any other person, or by any group of such
persons, shall be considered to have been made by a single political committee").
Moreover, if 100 PACs were to contribute to Smith and few other candidates,
and if specific individuals like our ardent Smith supporter were to contribute to
each, the FEC could weigh those "circumstantial factors" to determine whether
to deem the PACs affiliated. The FEC's analysis could take account of a
"common or overlapping membership" and "similar patterns of contributions or
contributors," among other considerations. The FEC has in the past initiated
enforcement proceedings against contributors with such suspicious patterns of
PAC donations. See, e.g., Conciliation Agreement, In re Riley, Matters Under
Review 4568, 4633, 4634, 4736 (FEC, Dec. 19, 2001).
On a more basic level, it is hard to believe that a rational actor would engage in
such machinations. In the example described, a dedicated donor spent
$500,000—donating the full $5,000 to 100 different PACs—to add just $26,000
to Smith's campaign coffers. That same donor, meanwhile, could have spent
unlimited funds on independent expenditures on behalf of Smith. Indeed, he
could have spent his entire $500,000 advocating for Smith, without the risk

Robson

633

The First Amendment

that his selected PACs would choose not to give to Smith, or that he would have
to share credit with other contributors to the PACs.
We have said in the context of independent expenditures that "`[t]he absence of
prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his
agent . . . undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate.'" Citizens
United (quoting Buckley). But probably not by 95 percent. And at least from the
donor's point of view, it strikes us as far more likely that he will want to see his
full $500,000 spent on behalf of his favored candidate—even if it must be spent
independently—rather than see it diluted to a small fraction so that it can be
contributed directly by someone else.
Another circumvention example ***
Buckley upheld aggregate limits only on the ground that they prevented
channeling money to candidates beyond the base limits. The absence of such a
prospect today belies the Government's asserted objective of preventing
corruption or its appearance. The improbability of circumvention indicates that
the aggregate limits instead further the impermissible objective of simply
limiting the amount of money in political campaigns.
C
Quite apart from the foregoing, the aggregate limits violate the First Amendment
because they are not "closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of
associational freedoms." Buckley. In the First Amendment context, fit matters.
Even when the Court is not applying strict scrutiny, we still require "a fit that is
not necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the
single best disposition but one whose scope is `in proportion to the interest
served,' . . . that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but . . . a
means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective." Board of Trustees of
State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox (1989). Here, because the statute is poorly tailored to
the Government's interest in preventing circumvention of the base limits, it
impermissibly restricts participation in the political process.
1
The Government argues that the aggregate limits are justified because they
prevent an individual from giving to too many initial recipients who might
subsequently recontribute a donation. After all, only recontributed funds can
conceivably give rise to circumvention of the base limits. Yet all indications are
that many types of recipients have scant interest in regifting donations they
receive.
Some figures might be useful to put the risk of circumvention in perspective.
We recognize that no data can be marshaled to capture perfectly the
counterfactual world in which aggregate limits do not exist. But, as we have
noted elsewhere, we can nonetheless ask "whether experience under the
present law confirms a serious threat of abuse." Federal Election Comm'n v.
Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. (2001). It does not. Experience
suggests that the vast majority of contributions made in excess of the aggregate
limits are likely to be retained and spent by their recipients rather than
rerouted to candidates.

Robson

634

The First Amendment

In the 2012 election cycle, federal candidates, political parties, and PACs spent
a total of $7 billion, according to the FEC. In particular, each national political
party's spending ran in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The National
Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), National Republican Congressional
Committee (NRCC), Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), and
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), however, spent less
than $1 million each on direct candidate contributions and less than $10
million each on coordinated expenditures. Brief for NRSC et al. as Amici Curiae
23, 25 (NRSC Brief). Including both coordinated expenditures and direct
candidate contributions, the NRSC and DSCC spent just 7% of their total funds
on contributions to candidates and the NRCC and DCCC spent just 3%.
Likewise, as explained previously, state parties rarely contribute to candidates
in other States. In the 2012 election cycle, the Republican and Democratic state
party committees in all 50 States (and the District of Columbia) contributed a
paltry $17,750 to House and Senate candidates in other States. The state party
committees spent over half a billion dollars over the same time period, of which
the $17,750 in contributions to other States' candidates constituted just
0.003%.
As with national and state party committees, candidates contribute only a small
fraction of their campaign funds to other candidates. ***
Based on what we can discern from experience, the indiscriminate ban on all
contributions above the aggregate limits is disproportionate to the
Government's interest in preventing circumvention. The Government has not
given us any reason to believe that parties or candidates would dramatically
shift their priorities if the aggregate limits were lifted. Absent such a showing,
we cannot conclude that the sweeping aggregate limits are appropriately
tailored to guard against any contributions that might implicate the
Government's anticircumvention interest.
A final point: It is worth keeping in mind that the base limits themselves are a
prophylactic measure. As we have explained, "restrictions on direct
contributions are preventative, because few if any contributions to candidates
will involve quid pro quo arrangements." Citizens United. The aggregate limits are
then layered on top, ostensibly to prevent circumvention of the base limits. This
"prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approach" requires that we be particularly
diligent in scrutinizing the law's fit. Wisconsin Right to Life (opinion of ROBERTS,
C. J.); see McConnell (opinion of THOMAS, J.).
2
Importantly, there are multiple alternatives available to Congress that would
serve the Government's anticircumvention interest, while avoiding "unnecessary
abridgment" of First Amendment rights. Buckley.
The most obvious might involve targeted restrictions on transfers among
candidates and political committees. There are currently no such limits on
transfers among party committees and from candidates to party committees. ***
One possible option for restricting transfers would be to require contributions
above the current aggregate limits to be deposited into segregated,
nontransferable accounts and spent only by their recipients. Such a solution

Robson

635

The First Amendment

would address the same circumvention possibilities as the current aggregate
limits, while not completely barring contributions beyond the aggregate levels.
In addition (or as an alternative), if Congress believes that circumvention is
especially likely to occur through creation of a joint fundraising committee, it
could require that funds received through those committees be spent by their
recipients (or perhaps it could simply limit the size of joint fundraising
committees). Such alternatives to the aggregate limits properly refocus the
inquiry on the delinquent actor: the recipient of a contribution within the base
limits, who then routes the money in a manner that undermines those limits.
Indeed, Congress has adopted transfer restrictions, and the Court has upheld
them, in the context of state party spending. *** McConnell upheld those
transfer restrictions as "justifiable anticircumvention measures," though it
acknowledged that they posed some associational burdens. Here, a narrow
transfer restriction on contributions that could otherwise be recontributed in
excess of the base limits could rely on a similar justification.
Other alternatives might focus on earmarking. ***
We do not mean to opine on the validity of any particular proposal. The point is
that there are numerous alternative approaches available to Congress to
prevent circumvention of the base limits.
D
Finally, disclosure of contributions minimizes the potential for abuse of the
campaign finance system. Disclosure requirements are in part "justified based
on a governmental interest in `provid[ing] the electorate with information' about
the sources of election-related spending." Citizens United (quoting Buckley).
They may also "deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption
by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity."
Disclosure requirements burden speech, but—unlike the aggregate limits—they
do not impose a ceiling on speech. Citizens United, but see McConnell (opinion of
THOMAS, J.). For that reason, disclosure often represents a less restrictive
alternative to flat bans on certain types or quantities of speech. See, e.g.,Federal
Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc. (1986).
With modern technology, disclosure now offers a particularly effective means of
arming the voting public with information. *** Reports and databases are
available on the FEC's Web site almost immediately after they are filed,
supplemented
by
private
entities
such
as
Open-Secrets.org
and
FollowTheMoney.org. Because massive quantities of information can be
accessed at the click of a mouse, disclosure is effective to a degree not possible
at the time Buckley, or even McConnell, was decided.
The existing aggregate limits may in fact encourage the movement of money
away from entities subject to disclosure. Because individuals' direct
contributions are limited, would-be donors may turn to other avenues for
political speech. See Citizens United. Individuals can, for example, contribute
unlimited amounts to 501(c) organizations, which are not required to publicly
disclose their donors. Such organizations spent some $300 million on
independent expenditures in the 2012 election cycle.
V

Robson

636

The First Amendment

At oral argument, the Government shifted its focus from Buckley's
anticircumvention rationale to an argument that the aggregate limits deter
corruption regardless of their ability to prevent circumvention of the base limits.
***
The Government suggests that it is the solicitation of large contributions that
poses the danger of corruption, but the aggregate limits are not limited to any
direct solicitation by an officeholder or candidate. Cf. McConnell (opinion of
KENNEDY, J.) (rejecting a ban on "soft money" contributions to national parties,
but approving a ban on the solicitation of such contributions as "a direct and
necessary regulation of federal candidates' and officeholders' receipt of quids").
We have no occasion to consider a law that would specifically ban candidates
from soliciting donations—within the base limits—that would go to many other
candidates, and would add up to a large sum. For our purposes here, it is
enough that the aggregate limits at issue are not directed specifically to
candidate behavior.
For the past 40 years, our campaign finance jurisprudence has focused on the
need to preserve authority for the Government to combat corruption, without at
the same time compromising the political responsiveness at the heart of the
democratic process, or allowing the Government to favor some participants in
that process over others. As Edmund Burke explained in his famous speech to
the electors of Bristol, a representative owes constituents the exercise of his
"mature judgment," but judgment informed by "the strictest union, the closest
correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his
constituents." The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke 129-130 (J.
Burke ed. 1867). Constituents have the right to support candidates who share
their views and concerns. Representatives are not to follow constituent orders,
but can be expected to be cognizant of and responsive to those concerns. Such
responsiveness is key to the very concept of self-governance through elected
officials.
The Government has a strong interest, no less critical to our democratic system,
in combatting corruption and its appearance. We have, however, held that this
interest must be limited to a specific kind of corruption—quid pro quo
corruption—in order to ensure that the Government's efforts do not have the
effect of restricting the First Amendment right of citizens to choose who shall
govern them. For the reasons set forth, we conclude that the aggregate limits on
contributions do not further the only governmental interest this Court accepted
as legitimate in Buckley. They instead intrude without justification on a citizen's
ability to exercise "the most fundamental First Amendment activities." Buckley.
The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings.
It is so ordered.

I adhere to the view that this Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1

For these reasons, I concur only in the judgment.

JUSTICE BREYER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, AND JUSTICE
KAGAN JOIN, DISSENTING.
Nearly 40 years ago in Buckley v. Valeo (1976) (per curiam), this Court
considered the constitutionality of laws that imposed limits upon the overall
amount a single person can contribute to all federal candidates, political parties,
and committees taken together. The Court held that those limits did not violate
the Constitution. Id.; accord, McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n (2003).
*** Today a majority of the Court overrules this holding. It is wrong to do so. Its
conclusion rests upon its own, not a record-based, view of the facts. Its legal
analysis is faulty: It misconstrues the nature of the competing constitutional
interests at stake. It understates the importance of protecting the political
integrity of our governmental institutions. It creates a loophole that will allow a
single individual to contribute millions of dollars to a political party or to a
candidate's campaign. Taken together with Citizens United v. Federal Election
Comm'n (2010), today's decision eviscerates our Nation's campaign finance laws,
leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic
legitimacy that those laws were intended to resolve.
I
The plurality concludes that the aggregate contribution limits "`unnecessar[ily]
abridg[e]'" First Amendment rights. It notes that some individuals will wish to
"spen[d] `substantial amounts of money in order to communicate [their] political
ideas through sophisticated' means." Aggregate contribution ceilings limit an
individual's ability to engage in such "broader participation in the democratic
process," while insufficiently advancing any legitimate governmental objective.
Hence, the plurality finds, they violate the Constitution.
The plurality's conclusion rests upon three separate but related claims. Each is
fatally flawed. First, the plurality says that given the base limits on
contributions to candidates and political committees, aggregate limits do not
further any independent governmental objective worthy of protection. And that
is because, given the base limits, "[s]pending large sums of money in connection
with elections" does not "give rise to . . . corruption." In making this argument,
the plurality relies heavily upon a narrow definition of "corruption" that

Robson

638

The First Amendment

excludes efforts to obtain "`influence over or access to' elected officials or
political parties."
Second, the plurality assesses the instrumental objective of the aggregate limits,
namely, safeguarding the base limits. It finds that they "do not serve that
function in any meaningful way." That is because, even without the aggregate
limits, the possibilities for circumventing the base limits are "implausible" and
"divorced from reality."
Third, the plurality says the aggregate limits are not a "`reasonable'" policy tool.
Rather, they are "poorly tailored to the Government's interest in preventing
circumvention of the base limits." The plurality imagines several alternative
regulations that it says might just as effectively thwart circumvention.
Accordingly, it finds, the aggregate caps are out of "`proportion to the
[anticorruption] interest served.'"
II
The plurality's first claim—that large aggregate contributions do not "give rise"
to "corruption"—is plausible only because the plurality defines "corruption" too
narrowly. The plurality describes the constitutionally permissible objective of
campaign finance regulation as follows: "Congress may target only a specific
type of corruption—`quid pro quo' corruption." It then defines quid pro quo
corruption to mean no more than "a direct exchange of an official act for
money"—an act akin to bribery. It adds specifically that corruption does not
include efforts to "garner `influence over or access to' elected officials or political
parties." Moreover, the Government's efforts to prevent the "appearance of
corruption" are "equally confined to the appearance of quid pro quo corruption,"
as narrowly defined. In the plurality's view, a federal statute could not prevent
an individual from writing a million dollar check to a political party (by donating
to its various committees), because the rationale for any limit would
"dangerously broade[n] the circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption
articulated in our prior cases."
This critically important definition of "corruption" is inconsistent with the
Court's prior case law (with the possible exception of Citizens United, as I will
explain below). It is virtually impossible to reconcile with this Court's decision
in McConnell, upholding the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA).
And it misunderstands the constitutional importance of the interests at stake.
In fact, constitutional interests—indeed, First Amendment interests—lie on both
sides of the legal equation.
A
In reality, as the history of campaign finance reform shows and as our earlier
cases on the subject have recognized, the anticorruption interest that drives
Congress to regulate campaign contributions is a far broader, more important
interest than the plurality acknowledges. It is an interest in maintaining the
integrity of our public governmental institutions. And it is an interest rooted in
the Constitution and in the First Amendment itself.
Consider at least one reason why the First Amendment protects political speech.
Speech does not exist in a vacuum. Rather, political communication seeks to
secure government action. A politically oriented "marketplace of ideas" seeks to
form a public opinion that can and will influence elected representatives.

Robson

639

The First Amendment

This is not a new idea. Eighty-seven years ago, Justice Brandeis wrote that the
First Amendment's protection of speech was "essential to effective democracy."
Whitney v. California (1927) (concurring opinion). Chief Justice Hughes
reiterated the same idea shortly thereafter: "A fundamental principle of our
constitutional system" is the "maintenance of the opportunity for free political
discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the
people." Stromberg v. California (1931) (emphasis added). In Citizens United, the
Court stated that "[s]peech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the
means to hold officials accountable to the people." (emphasis added).
The Framers had good reason to emphasize this same connection between
political speech and governmental action. An influential 18th-century
continental philosopher had argued that in a representative democracy, the
people lose control of their representatives between elections, during which
interim periods they were "in chains." J. ROUSSEAU, AN INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE
OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT 265-266 (transl. 1791).
The Framers responded to this criticism both by requiring frequent elections to
federal office, and by enacting a First Amendment that would facilitate a "chain
of communication between the people, and those, to whom they have committed
the exercise of the powers of government." J. WILSON, COMMENTARIES ON THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 30-31 (1792). This "chain"
would establish the necessary "communion of interests and sympathy of
sentiments" between the people and their representatives, so that public
opinion could be channeled into effective governmental action. THE FEDERALIST
NO. 57, p. 386 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison); accord, T. Benton, 1
Abridgement of the Debates of Congress, from 1789 to 1856, p. 141 (1857)
(explaining that the First Amendment will strengthen American democracy by
giving "`the people'" a right to "`publicly address their representatives,'"
"`privately advise them,'" or "`declare their sentiments by petition to the whole
body'" (quoting James Madison)). Accordingly, the First Amendment advances
not only the individual's right to engage in political speech, but also the public's
interest in preserving a democratic order in which collective speech matters.
What has this to do with corruption? It has everything to do with corruption.
Corruption breaks the constitutionally necessary "chain of communication"
between the people and their representatives. It derails the essential speech-togovernment-action tie. Where enough money calls the tune, the general public
will not be heard. Insofar as corruption cuts the link between political thought
and political action, a free marketplace of political ideas loses its point. That is
one reason why the Court has stressed the constitutional importance of
Congress' concern that a few large donations not drown out the voices of the
many. See, e.g., Buckley.
That is also why the Court has used the phrase "subversion of the political
process" to describe circumstances in which "[e]lected officials are influenced to
act contrary to their obligations of office by the prospect of financial gain to
themselves or infusions of money into their campaigns."
The "appearance of corruption" can make matters worse. It can lead the public
to believe that its efforts to communicate with its representatives or to help
sway public opinion have little purpose. And a cynical public can lose interest

Robson

640

The First Amendment

in political participation altogether. See Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government
PAC (2000) ("[T]he cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could
jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance").
Democracy, the Court has often said, cannot work unless "the people have faith
in those who govern." United States v. Mississippi Valley Generating Co. (1961).
The upshot is that the interests the Court has long described as preventing
"corruption" or the "appearance of corruption" are more than ordinary factors to
be weighed against the constitutional right to political speech. Rather, they are
interests rooted in the First Amendment itself. They are rooted in the
constitutional effort to create a democracy responsive to the people—a
government where laws reflect the very thoughts, views, ideas, and sentiments,
the expression of which the First Amendment protects. Given that end, we can
and should understand campaign finance laws as resting upon a broader and
more significant constitutional rationale than the plurality's limited definition of
"corruption" suggests. We should see these laws as seeking in significant part to
strengthen, rather than weaken, the First Amendment. To say this is not to
deny the potential for conflict between (1) the need to permit contributions that
pay for the diffusion of ideas, and (2) the need to limit payments in order to help
maintain the integrity of the electoral process. But that conflict takes place
within, not outside, the First Amendment's boundaries.
B
Since the kinds of corruption that can destroy the link between public opinion
and governmental action extend well beyond those the plurality describes, the
plurality's notion of corruption is flatly inconsistent with the basic
constitutional rationale I have just described. Thus, it should surprise no one
that this Court's case law (Citizens United excepted) insists upon a considerably
broader definition.
In Buckley, for instance, the Court said explicitly that aggregate limits were
constitutional because they helped "prevent evasion . . . [through] huge
contributions to the candidate's political party," (the contrary to what the
plurality today seems to believe). Moreover, Buckley upheld the base limits in
significant part because they helped thwart "the appearance of corruption
stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a
regime of large individual financial contributions." (emphasis added). And it said
that Congress could reasonably conclude that criminal laws forbidding "the
giving and taking of bribes" did not adequately "deal with the reality or
appearance of corruption." Bribery laws, the Court recognized, address "only
the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence
governmental action." The concern with corruption extends further.
Other cases put the matter yet more strongly. In Beaumont, for example, the
Court found constitutional a ban on direct contributions by corporations
because of the need to prevent corruption, properly "understood not only as
quid pro quo agreements, but also as undue influence on an officeholder's
judgment." Federal Election Comm'n v. Beaumont (2003). In Federal Election
Comm'n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. (2001) (Colorado II),
the Court upheld limits imposed upon coordinated expenditures among parties
and candidates because it found they thwarted corruption and its appearance,
again understood as including "undue influence" by wealthy donors. In Shrink

Robson

641

The First Amendment

Missouri, the Court upheld limitations imposed by the Missouri Legislature
upon contributions to state political candidates, not only because of the need to
prevent bribery, but also because of "the broader threat from politicians too
compliant with the wishes of large contributors."
C
Most important, in McConnell, this Court considered the constitutionality of the
Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, an Act that set new limits on "soft
money" contributions to political parties. "Soft money" referred to funds that,
prior to BCRA, were freely donated to parties for activities other than directly
helping elect a federal candidate—activities such as voter registration, "get out
the vote" drives, and advertising that did not expressly advocate a federal
candidate's election or defeat. BCRA imposed a new ban on soft money
contributions to national party committees, and greatly curtailed them in
respect to state and local parties.
The Court in McConnell upheld these new contribution restrictions under the
First Amendment for the very reason the plurality today discounts or ignores.
Namely, the Court found they thwarted a significant risk of corruption—
understood not as quid pro quo bribery, but as privileged access to and
pernicious influence upon elected representatives.
In reaching its conclusion in McConnell, the Court relied upon a vast record
compiled in the District Court. That record consisted of over 100,000 pages of
material and included testimony from more than 200 witnesses. What it showed,
in detail, was the web of relationships and understandings among parties,
candidates, and large donors that underlies privileged access and influence.
The District Judges in McConnell made clear that the record did "not contain
any evidence of bribery or vote buying in exchange for donations of nonfederal
money." Indeed, no one had identified a "single discrete instance of quid pro
quo corruption" due to soft money. But what the record did demonstrate was
that enormous soft money contributions, ranging between $1 million and $5
million among the largest donors, enabled wealthy contributors to gain
disproportionate "access to federal lawmakers" and the ability to "influenc[e]
legislation." There was an indisputable link between generous political
donations and opportunity after opportunity to make one's case directly to a
Member of Congress.
Testimony by elected officials supported this conclusion. ***
This Court upheld BCRA's limitations on soft money contributions by relying on
just the kind of evidence I have described. ***
We specifically rejected efforts to define "corruption" in ways similar to those the
plurality today accepts. We added:
"Just as troubling to a functioning democracy as classic quid pro quo corruption
is the danger that officeholders will decide issues not on the merits or the
desires of their constituencies, but according to the wishes of those who have
made large financial contributions valued by the officeholder."

Insofar as today's decision sets forth a significantly narrower definition of
"corruption," and hence of the public's interest in political integrity, it is flatly
inconsistent with McConnell.

One case, however, contains language that offers the plurality support. That
case is Citizens United. There, as the plurality points out, the Court said that
"[w]hen Buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in
preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited
to quid pro quo corruption." Further, the Court said that quid pro quo corruption
does not include "influence over or access to elected officials," because "`generic
favoritism or influence theory . . . is at odds with standard First Amendment
analyses.'"
How should we treat these statements from Citizens United now? They are not
essential to the Court's holding in the case—at least insofar as it can be read to
require federal law to treat corporations and trade unions like individuals when
they independently pay for, e.g., television advertising during the last 60 days of
a federal election. Citizens United. Taken literally, the statements cited simply
refer to and characterize still earlier Court cases. They do not require the more
absolute reading that the plurality here gives them.
More than that. Read as the plurality reads them today, the statements from
Citizens United about the proper contours of the corruption rationale conflict
not just with language in the McConnell opinion, but with McConnell's very
holding. Did the Court in Citizens United intend to overrule McConnell? I doubt
it, for if it did, the Court or certainly the dissent would have said something
about it. The total silence of all opinions in Citizens United with respect to this
matter argues strongly in favor of treating the language quoted above as dictum,
as an overstatement, or as limited to the context in which it appears. Citizens
United itself contains language that supports the last mentioned reading, for it
says that "[Buckley] did not extend this rationale [about the reality or
appearance of corruption] to independent expenditures, and the Court does not
do so here." (emphasis added). And it adds that, while "[t]he BCRA record
establishes that certain donations to political parties, called `soft money,' were
made to gain access to elected officials," "[t]his case, however, is about
independent expenditures, not soft money." (emphasis added).
The plurality's use of Citizens United's narrow definition of corruption here,
however, is a different matter. That use does not come accompanied with a
limiting context (independent expenditures by corporations and unions) or
limiting language. It applies to the whole of campaign finance regulation. And,
as I have pointed out, it is flatly inconsistent with the broader definition of
corruption upon which McConnell's holding depends.
So: Does the Court intend today to overrule McConnell? Or does it intend to
leave McConnell and BCRA in place? The plurality says the latter. [in note 6]
("Our holding about the constitutionality of the aggregate limits clearly does not
overrule McConnell's holding about `soft money'"). But how does the plurality
explain its rejection of the broader definition of corruption, upon which
McConnell's holding depends?
III
The plurality invalidates the aggregate contribution limits for a second reason.
It believes they are no longer needed to prevent contributors from

Robson

643

The First Amendment

circumventing federal limits on direct contributions to individuals, political
parties, and political action committees. ***
The plurality is wrong. Here, as in Buckley, in the absence of limits on
aggregate political contributions, donors can and likely will find ways to
channel millions of dollars to parties and to individual candidates, producing
precisely the kind of "corruption" or "appearance of corruption" that previously
led the Court to hold aggregate limits constitutional. Those opportunities for
circumvention will also produce the type of corruption that concerns the
plurality today. The methods for using today's opinion to evade the law's
individual contribution limits are complex, but they are well known, or will
become well known, to party fundraisers. I shall describe three.
A
Example One: Gifts for the Benefit of the Party. Campaign finance law permits
each individual to give $64,800 over two years to a national party committee. 2
U. S. C. §441a(a)(1)(B); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532 (2013). The two major political parties
each have three national committees. Federal law also entitles an individual to
give $20,000 to a state party committee over two years. §441a(a)(1)(D). Each
major political party has 50 such committees. Those individual limits mean that,
in the absence of any aggregate limit, an individual could legally give to the
Republican Party or to the Democratic Party about $1.2 million over two years.
To make it easier for contributors to give gifts of this size, each party could
create a "Joint Party Committee," comprising all of its national and state party
committees. The titular heads could be the Speaker of the House of
Representatives and the Minority Leader of the House. A contributor could then
write a single check to the Joint Party Committee—and its staff would divide the
funds so that each constituent unit receives no more than it could obtain from
the contributor directly ($64,800 for a national committee over two years,
$20,000 for a state committee over the same). Before today's decision, the total
size of Rich Donor's check to the Joint Party Committee was capped at
$74,600—the aggregate limit for donations to political parties over a 2-year
election cycle. See §441a(a)(3)(B); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532. After today's decision, Rich
Donor can write a single check to the Joint Party Committee in an amount of
about $1.2 million.
Will political parties seek these large checks? Why not? The recipient national
and state committees can spend the money to buy generic party advertisements,
say television commercials or bumper stickers saying "Support Republicans,"
"Support Democrats," or the like. They also can transfer the money to party
committees in battleground States to increase the chances of winning hotly
contested seats. See §441a(a)(4) (permitting national or state political
committees to make unlimited "transfers" to other committees "of the same
political party").
Will party officials and candidates solicit these large contributions from wealthy
donors? Absolutely. Such contributions will help increase the party's power, as
well as the candidate's standing among his colleagues.
Will elected officials be particularly grateful to the large donor, feeling obliged to
provide him special access and influence, and perhaps even a quid pro quo
legislative favor? That is what we have previously believed. See McConnell

Robson

644

The First Amendment

("Large soft-money donations at a candidate's or officeholder's behest give rise
to all of the same corruption concerns posed by contributions made directly to
the candidate or officeholder"); id. (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) ("The making of a
solicited gift is a quid both to the recipient of the money and to the one who
solicits the payment"); Colorado II, (explaining how a candidate can "become a
player [in his party] beyond his own race" by "directing donations to the party
and making sure that the party knows who raised the money," and that "the
donor's influence is multiplied" in such instances). And, as the statements
collected in Appendix A, make clear, we have believed this with good reason.
Example Two: Donations to Individual Candidates (The $3.6 Million Check).
The first example significantly understates the problem. That is because federal
election law also allows a single contributor to give $5,200 to each party
candidate over a 2-year election cycle (assuming the candidate is running in
both a primary and a general election). §441a(a)(1)(A); 78 Fed. Reg. 8532. There
are 435 party candidates for House seats and 33 party candidates for Senate
seats in any given election year. That makes an additional $2.4 million in
allowable contributions. Thus, without an aggregate limit, the law will permit a
wealthy individual to write a check, over a 2-year election cycle, for $3.6
million—all to benefit his political party and its candidates.
To make it easier for a wealthy donor to make a contribution of this size, the
parties can simply enlarge the composition of the Joint Party Committee
described in Example One, so that it now includes party candidates. And a party
can proliferate such joint entities, perhaps calling the first the "Smith Victory
Committee," the second the "Jones Victory Committee," and the like. See 11
CFR §102.17(c)(5) (2012). (I say "perhaps" because too transparent a name
might call into play certain earmarking rules. But the Federal Election
Commission's (FEC) database of joint fundraising committees in 2012 shows
similarly named entities, e.g.,"Landrieu Wyden Victory Fund," etc.).
As I have just said, without any aggregate limit, the law will allow Rich Donor to
write a single check to, say, the Smith Victory Committee, for up to $3.6 million.
This check represents "the total amount that the contributor could contribute
to all of the participants" in the Committee over a 2-year cycle. The Committee
would operate under an agreement that provides a "formula for the allocation of
fundraising proceeds" among its constituent units. And that "formula" would
divide the proceeds so that no committee or candidate receives more than it
could have received from Rich Donor directly—$64,800, $20,000, or $5,200.
So what is wrong with that? The check is considerably larger than Example
One's check. But is there anything else wrong? The answer is yes, absolutely.
The law will also permit a party and its candidates to shift most of Rich Donor's
contributions to a single candidate, say Smith. Here is how:
The law permits each candidate and each party committee in the Smith Victory
Committee to write Candidate Smith a check directly. For his primary and
general elections combined, they can write checks of up to $4,000 (from each
candidate's authorized campaign committee) and $10,000 (from each state and
national committee). This yields a potential $1,872,000 (from candidates) plus
$530,000 (from party committees). Thus, the law permits the candidates and
party entities to redirect $2.37 million of Rich Donor's $3.6 million check to

Robson

645

The First Amendment

Candidate Smith. It also permits state and national committees to contribute to
Smith's general election campaign through making coordinated expenditures—
in amounts that range from $46,600 to $2.68 million for a general election
(depending upon the size of Smith's State and whether he is running for a
House or Senate seat).
The upshot is that Candidate Smith can receive at least $2.37 million and
possibly the full $3.6 million contributed by Rich Donor to the Smith Victory
Committee, even though the funds must first be divided up among the
constituent units before they can be rerouted to Smith. Nothing requires the
Smith Victory Committee to explain in advance to Rich Donor all of the various
transfers that will take place, and nothing prevents the entities in the
Committee from informing the donor and the receiving candidate after the fact
what has transpired. Accordingly, the money can be donated and rerouted to
Candidate Smith without the donor having violated the base limits or any other
FEC regulation. And the evidence in the McConnell record reprinted in Appendix
A, —with respect to soft money contributions—makes clear that Candidate
Smith will almost certainly come to learn from whom he has received this
money.
The parties can apply the same procedure to other large donations, channeling
money from Rich Donor Two to Candidate Jones. If 10 or 20 candidates face
particularly tight races, party committees and party candidates may work
together to channel Rich Donor One's multimillion dollar contribution to the
Most Embattled Candidate (e.g., Candidate Smith), Rich Donor Two's
multimillion dollar contribution to the Second Most Embattled Candidate
(e.g., Candidate Jones), and so on down the line. If this does not count as
evasion of the base limits, what does? Present aggregate limits confine the size
of any individual gift to $123,200. Today's opinion creates a loophole measured
in the millions.
Example Three: Proliferating Political Action Committees (PACs). Campaign
finance law prohibits an individual from contributing (1) more than $5,200 to
any candidate in a federal election cycle, and (2) more than $5,000 to a PAC in
a calendar year. It also prohibits (3) any PAC from contributing more than
$10,000 to any candidate in an election cycle. But the law does not prohibit an
individual from contributing (within the current $123,200 biannual aggregate
limit) $5,000 to each of an unlimited total number of PACs. And there, so to
speak, lies the rub.
Here is how, without any aggregate limits, a party will be able to channel $2
million from each of ten Rich Donors to each of ten Embattled Candidates.
Groups of party supporters—individuals, corporations, or trade unions— create
200 PACs. Each PAC claims it will use the funds it raises to support several
candidates from the party, though it will favor those who are most endangered.
(Each PAC qualifies for "multicandidate" status because it has received
contributions from more than 50 persons and has made contributions to five
federal candidates at some point previously. Over a 2-year election cycle, Rich
Donor One gives $10,000 to each PAC ($5,000 per year)—yielding $2 million
total. Rich Donor 2 does the same. So, too, do the other eight Rich Donors. This

Robson

646

The First Amendment

brings their total donations to $20 million, disbursed among the 200 PACs.
Each PAC will have collected $100,000, and each can use its money to write ten
checks of $10,000—to each of the ten most Embattled Candidates in the party
(over two years). See Appendix B. Every Embattled Candidate, receiving a
$10,000 check from 200 PACs, will have collected $2 million.
The upshot is that ten Rich Donors will have contributed $2 million each, and
ten Embattled Candidates will have collected $2 million each. In this example,
unlike Example Two, the recipient candidates may not know which of the ten
Rich Donors is personally responsible for the $2 million he or she receives. But
the recipient candidate is highly likely to know who the ten Rich Donors are,
and to feel appropriately grateful. Moreover, the ability of a small group of
donors to contribute this kind of money to threatened candidates is not
insignificant. In the example above—with ten Rich Donors giving $2 million
each, and ten Embattled Candidates receiving $2 million each—the
contributions would have been enough to finance a considerable portion of, and
perhaps all of, the candidates' races in the 2012 elections. See Appendix C,
(showing that in 2012, the average winning House candidate spent $1.6 million
and the average winning Senate candidate spent $11.5 million).
B
The plurality believes that the three scenarios I have just depicted either pose
no threat, or cannot or will not take place. ***
*** [T]he plurality points to another FEC regulation (also added in 1976), which
says that "an individual who has contributed to a candidate" may not "also
contribute to a political committee that has supported or anticipates supporting
the same candidate if the individual knows that `a substantial portion [of his
contribution] will be contributed to, or expended on behalf of,' that candidate."
This regulation is important, for in principle, the FEC might use it to prevent
the circumstances that Examples Two and Three set forth from arising. And it is
not surprising that the plurality relies upon the existence of this rule when it
describes those circumstances as "implausible," "illegal," or "divorced from
reality."
In fact, however, this regulation is not the strong anti-circumvention weapon
that the plurality imagines. Despite the plurality's assurances, it does not
"disarm" the possibilities for circumvention. That is because the regulation
requires a showing that donors have "knowledge that a substantial portion" of
their contributions will be used by a PAC to support a candidate to whom they
have already contributed. §110.1(h)(2) (emphasis added). And "knowledge" is
hard to prove.
I have found nine FEC cases decided since the year 2000 that refer to this
regulation. In all but one, the FEC failed to find the requisite "knowledge"— ***
Given this record of FEC (in)activity, my reaction to the plurality's reliance upon
agency enforcement of this rule (as an adequate substitute for Congress'
aggregate limits) is like Oscar Wilde's after reading Dickens' account of the
death of Little Nell: "One must have a heart of stone," said Wilde, "to read [it]
without laughing." Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations 86 (N. Sherrin
2d ed. 2001).

Robson

647

The First Amendment

I have found one contrary example—the single example to which the plurality
refers. ***
Thus, it is not surprising that throughout the many years this FEC regulation
has been in effect, political parties and candidates have established ever more
joint fundraising committees (numbering over 500 in the last federal elections);
candidates have established ever more "Leadership PACs" (numbering over 450
in the last elections); and party supporters have established ever more
multicandidate PACs (numbering over 3,000 in the last elections). See Appendix
C; FEC, 2014 Committee Summary (reporting the number of "qualified" (or
multicandidate)PACs
in
2012),
online
at
http://www.fec.gov/data/
CommitteeSummary.do (all Internet materials as visited Mar. 28, 2014, and
available in Clerk of Court's case file).
Using these entities, candidates, parties, and party supporters can transfer and,
we are told, have transferred large sums of money to specific candidates,
thereby avoiding the base contribution limits *** . They have done so without
drawing FEC prosecution—at least not according to my (and apparently the
plurality's) search of publicly available records. That is likely because in the real
world, the methods of achieving circumvention are more subtle and more
complex than our stylized Examples Two and Three depict. And persons have
used these entities to channel money to candidates without any individual
breaching the current aggregate $123,200 limit. The plurality now removes that
limit, thereby permitting wealthy donors to make aggregate contributions not of
$123,200, but of several millions of dollars. If the FEC regulation has failed to
plug a small hole, how can it possibly plug a large one?
IV
The plurality concludes that even if circumvention were a threat, the aggregate
limits are "poorly tailored" to address it. The First Amendment requires "`a fit
that is . . . reasonable,'" and there is no such "fit" here because there are several
alternative ways Congress could prevent evasion of the base limits. For instance,
the plurality posits, Congress (or the FEC) could "tighten . . . transfer rules"; it
could require "contributions above the current aggregate limits to be deposited
into segregated, nontransferable accounts and spent only by their recipients"; it
could define "how many candidates a PAC must support in order to ensure that
`a substantial portion' of a donor's contribution is not rerouted to a certain
candidate"; or it could prohibit "donors who have contributed the current
maximum sums from further contributing to political committees that have
indicated they will support candidates to whom the donor has already
contributed."
The plurality, however, does not show, or try to show, that these hypothetical
alternatives could effectively replace aggregate contribution limits. Indeed, it
does not even "opine on the validity of any particular proposal," presumably
because these proposals themselves could be subject to constitutional
challenges. For the most part, the alternatives the plurality mentions were
similarly available at the time of Buckley. Their hypothetical presence did not
prevent the Court from upholding aggregate limits in 1976. How can their
continued hypothetical presence lead the plurality now to conclude that
aggregate limits are "poorly tailored?" How can their continued hypothetical
presence lead the Court to overrule Buckley now?

Robson

648

The First Amendment

In sum, the explanation of why aggregate limits are needed is complicated, as is
the explanation of why other methods will not work. But the conclusion is
simple: There is no "substantial mismatch" between Congress' legitimate
objective and the "means selected to achieve it." The Court, as in Buckley,
should hold that aggregate contribution limits are constitutional.
V
The District Court in this case, holding that Buckley foreclosed McCutcheon's
constitutional challenge to the aggregate limits, granted the Government's
motion to dismiss the complaint prior to a full evidentiary hearing. If the
plurality now believes the District Court was wrong, then why does it not return
the case for the further evidentiary development which has not yet taken place?
***
For one thing, an evidentiary record can help us determine whether or the
extent to which we should defer to Congress' own judgments, particularly those
reflecting a balance of the countervailing First Amendment interests I have
described. Determining whether anticorruption objectives justify a particular
set of contribution limits requires answering empirically based questions, and
applying significant discretion and judgment. To what extent will unrestricted
giving lead to corruption or its appearance? What forms will any such
corruption take? To what extent will a lack of regulation undermine public
confidence in the democratic system? To what extent can regulation restore it?
These kinds of questions, while not easily answered, are questions that
Congress is far better suited to resolve than are judges. Thus, while court
review of contribution limits has been and should be "rigorous," Buckley we
have also recognized that "deference to legislative choice is warranted."
Beaumont. And that deference has taken account of facts and circumstances set
forth in an evidentiary record.
For another thing, a comparison of the plurality's opinion with this dissent
reveals important differences of opinion on fact-related matters. We disagree,
for example, on the possibilities for circumvention of the base limits in the
absence of aggregate limits. We disagree about how effectively the plurality's
"alternatives" could prevent evasion. An evidentiary proceeding would permit
the parties to explore these matters, and it would permit the courts to reach a
more accurate judgment. The plurality rationalizes its haste to forgo an
evidentiary record by noting that "the parties have treated the question as a
purely legal one." But without a doubt, the legal question—whether the
aggregate limits are closely drawn to further a compelling governmental
interest—turns on factual questions about whether corruption, in the absence
of such limits, is a realistic threat to our democracy. The plurality itself spends
pages citing figures about campaign spending to defend its "legal" conclusion.
The problem with such reasoning is that this Court's expertise does not lie in
marshaling facts in the primary instance. That is why in the past, when
answering similar questions about the constitutionality of restrictions on
campaign contributions, we have relied on an extensive evidentiary record
produced below to inform our decision.
Without further development of the record, however, I fail to see how the
plurality can now find grounds for overturning Buckley. The justification for

Robson

649

The First Amendment

aggregate contribution restrictions is strongly rooted in the need to assure
political integrity and ultimately in the First Amendment itself. The threat to
that integrity posed by the risk of special access and influence remains real.
Part III, supra. Even taking the plurality on its own terms and considering solely
the threat of quid pro quo corruption (i.e., money-for-votes exchanges), the
aggregate limits are a necessary tool to stop circumvention. And there is no
basis for finding a lack of "fit" between the threat and the means used to
combat it, namely the aggregate limits.
The plurality reaches the opposite conclusion. The result, as I said at the outset,
is a decision that substitutes judges' understandings of how the political
process works for the understanding of Congress; that fails to recognize the
difference between influence resting upon public opinion and influence bought
by money alone; that overturns key precedent; that creates huge loopholes in
the law; and that undermines, perhaps devastates, what remains of campaign
finance reform.
With respect, I dissent.

Soon after Citizens United, the DISCLOSE Act (Democracy Is
Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections Act) was
introduced in Congress, however it has stalled. The Act would mandate
more disclosures regarding contributions.
Disclosure and so-called “dark money” is now considered a major issue,
with some arguing that it has increased after Citizens United.
Interestingly, Chief Justice Roberts for the Court in McCutcheon suggests
that disclosure would be one acceptable answer (“Disclosure
requirements burden speech, but—unlike the aggregate limits—they do
not impose a ceiling on speech). He also notes that “modern technology”
facilitates wide disclosure: “Reports and databases are available on the
FEC's Web site almost immediately after they are filed, supplemented by
private entities such as Open-Secrets.org and FollowTheMoney.org.”
But as Roberts also notes, at present, “Individuals can, for example,
contribute unlimited amounts to 501(c) organizations, which are not
required to publicly disclose their donors,” and adds that such
“organizations spent some $300 million on independent expenditures in
the 2012 election cycle.” This “dark money” is subject to IRS regulation
regarding the tax-exempt nonprofit status of the 501(c) corporation, but
IRS rule-making has not been successful.

even if constitutional, is disclosure a solution to the practical problems of

JUSTICE SCALIA DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The question presented in this case is whether the First Amendment permits
the Minnesota Supreme Court to prohibit candidates for judicial election in that
State from announcing their views on disputed legal and political issues.
I
Since Minnesota's admission to the Union in 1858, the State's Constitution has
provided for the selection of all state judges by popular election. Minn. Const.,
Art. VI, §7. Since 1912, those elections have been nonpartisan. Act of June 19,
ch. 2, 1912 Minn. Laws Special Sess., pp. 4-6. Since 1974, they have been
subject to a legal restriction which states that a "candidate for a judicial office,
including an incumbent judge," shall not "announce his or her views on
disputed legal or political issues." Minn. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon
5(A)(3)(d)(i) (2000). This prohibition, promulgated by the Minnesota Supreme
Court and based on Canon 7(B) of the 1972 American Bar Association (ABA)
Model Code of Judicial Conduct, is known as the "announce clause." Incumbent
judges who violate it are subject to discipline, including removal, censure, civil
penalties, and suspension without pay. Lawyers who run for judicial office also
must comply with the announce clause. Minn. Rule of Professional Conduct
8.2(b) (2002) ("A lawyer who is a candidate for judicial office shall comply with
the applicable provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct"). Those who violate it
are subject to, inter alia, disbarment, suspension, and probation. Rule 8.4(a);
Minn. Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility 8-14, 15(a) (2002).
In 1996, one of the petitioners, Gregory Wersal, ran for associate justice of the
Minnesota Supreme Court. In the course of the campaign, he distributed
literature criticizing several Minnesota Supreme Court decisions on issues such
as crime, welfare, and abortion. A complaint against Wersal challenging, among
other things, the propriety of this literature was filed with the Office of Lawyers
Professional Responsibility, the agency which, under the direction of the
Minnesota Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board, investigates and
prosecutes ethical violations of lawyer candidates for judicial office. The

Robson

651

The First Amendment

Lawyers Board dismissed the complaint; with regard to the charges that his
campaign materials violated the announce clause, it expressed doubt whether
the clause could constitutionally be enforced. Nonetheless, fearing that further
ethical complaints would jeopardize his ability to practice law, Wersal withdrew
from the election. In 1998, Wersal ran again for the same office. Early in that
race, he sought an advisory opinion from the Lawyers Board with regard to
whether it planned to enforce the announce clause. The Lawyers Board
responded equivocally, stating that, although it had significant doubts about
the constitutionality of the provision, it was unable to answer his question
because he had not submitted a list of the announcements he wished to make.2
Shortly thereafter, Wersal filed this lawsuit in Federal District Court against
respondents, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the announce clause violates
the First Amendment and an injunction against its enforcement. Wersal alleged
that he was forced to refrain from announcing his views on disputed issues
during the 1998 campaign, to the point where he declined response to
questions put to him by the press and public, out of concern that he might run
afoul of the announce clause. Other plaintiffs in the suit, including the
Minnesota Republican Party, alleged that, because the clause kept Wersal from
announcing his views, they were unable to learn those views and support or
oppose his candidacy accordingly. The parties filed cross-motions for summary
judgment, and the District Court found in favor of respondents, holding that
the announce clause did not violate the First Amendment. Over a dissent by
Judge Beam, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.
We granted certiorari.
II
Before considering the constitutionality of the announce clause, we must be
clear about its meaning. Its text says that a candidate for judicial office shall
not "announce his or her views on disputed legal or political issues." Minn.
Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(i) (2002).
We know that "announc[ing] . . . views" on an issue covers much more than
promising to decide an issue a particular way. The prohibition extends to the
candidate's mere statement of his current position, even if he does not bind
himself to maintain that position after election. All the parties agree this is the
case, because the Minnesota Code contains a so-called "pledges or promises"
clause, which separately prohibits judicial candidates from making "pledges or
promises of conduct in office other than the faithful and impartial performance
of the duties of the office," ibid.--a prohibition that is not challenged here and
on which we express no view.
There are, however, some limitations that the Minnesota Supreme Court has
placed upon the scope of the announce clause that are not (to put it politely)
immediately apparent from its text. The statements that formed the basis of the
complaint against Wersal in 1996 included criticism of past decisions of the
Minnesota Supreme Court. One piece of campaign literature stated that "[t]he
Minnesota Supreme Court has issued decisions which are marked by their
disregard for the Legislature and a lack of common sense." It went on to criticize
a decision excluding from evidence confessions by criminal defendants that
were not tape-recorded, asking "[s]hould we conclude that because the Supreme

Robson

652

The First Amendment

Court does not trust police, it allows confessed criminals to go free?" It criticized
a decision striking down a state law restricting welfare benefits, asserting that
"[i]t's the Legislature which should set our spending policies." And it criticized a
decision requiring public financing of abortions for poor women as
"unprecedented" and a "pro-abortion stance." Although one would think that all
of these statements touched on disputed legal or political issues, they did not
(or at least do not now) fall within the scope of the announce clause. The
Judicial Board issued an opinion stating that judicial candidates may criticize
past decisions, and the Lawyers Board refused to discipline Wersal for the
foregoing statements because, in part, it thought they did not violate the
announce clause. The Eighth Circuit relied on the Judicial Board's opinion in
upholding the announce clause and the Minnesota Supreme Court recently
embraced the Eighth Circuit's interpretation.
There are yet further limitations upon the apparent plain meaning of the
announce clause: In light of the constitutional concerns, the District Court
construed the clause to reach only disputed issues that are likely to come
before the candidate if he is elected judge. The Eighth Circuit accepted this
limiting interpretation by the District Court, and in addition construed the
clause to allow general discussions of case law and judicial philosophy. The
Supreme Court of Minnesota adopted these interpretations as well when it
ordered enforcement of the announce clause in accordance with the Eighth
Circuit's opinion.
It seems to us, however, that--like the text of the announce clause itself--these
limitations upon the text of the announce clause are not all that they appear to
be. First, respondents acknowledged at oral argument that statements critical
of past judicial decisions are not permissible if the candidate also states that he
is against stare decisis. Thus, candidates must choose between stating their
views critical of past decisions and stating their views in opposition to stare
decisis. Or, to look at it more concretely, they may state their view that prior
decisions were erroneous only if they do not assert that they, if elected, have
any power to eliminate erroneous decisions. Second, limiting the scope of the
clause to issues likely to come before a court is not much of a limitation at all.
One would hardly expect the "disputed legal or political issues" raised in the
course of a state judicial election to include such matters as whether the
Federal Government should end the embargo of Cuba. Quite obviously, they will
be those legal or political disputes that are the proper (or by past decisions have
been made the improper) business of the state courts. And within that relevant
category, "[t]here is almost no legal or political issue that is unlikely to come
before a judge of an American court, state or federal, of general jurisdiction."
Third, construing the clause to allow "general" discussions of case law and
judicial philosophy turns out to be of little help in an election campaign. At oral
argument, respondents gave, as an example of this exception, that a candidate
is free to assert that he is a " `strict constructionist.' " But that, like most other
philosophical generalities, has little meaningful content for the electorate unless
it is exemplified by application to a particular issue of construction likely to
come before a court--for example, whether a particular statute runs afoul of any
provision of the Constitution. Respondents conceded that the announce clause
would prohibit the candidate from exemplifying his philosophy in this fashion.

Robson

653

The First Amendment

Without such application to real-life issues, all candidates can claim to be
"strict constructionists" with equal (and unhelpful) plausibility.
In any event, it is clear that the announce clause prohibits a judicial candidate
from stating his views on any specific nonfanciful legal question within the
province of the court for which he is running, except in the context of
discussing past decisions--and in the latter context as well, if he expresses the
view that he is not bound by stare decisis.
Respondents contend that this still leaves plenty of topics for discussion on the
campaign trail. These include a candidate's "character," "education," "work
habits," and "how [he] would handle administrative duties if elected." Indeed,
the Judicial Board has printed a list of preapproved questions which judicial
candidates are allowed to answer. These include how the candidate feels about
cameras in the courtroom, how he would go about reducing the caseload, how
the costs of judicial administration can be reduced, and how he proposes to
ensure that minorities and women are treated more fairly by the court system.
Whether this list of preapproved subjects, and other topics not prohibited by
the announce clause, adequately fulfill the First Amendment's guarantee of
freedom of speech is the question to which we now turn.
III
As the Court of Appeals recognized, the announce clause both prohibits speech
on the basis of its content and burdens a category of speech that is "at the core
of our First Amendment freedoms"--speech about the qualifications of
candidates for public office. The Court of Appeals concluded that the proper test
to be applied to determine the constitutionality of such a restriction is what our
cases have called strict scrutiny; the parties do not dispute that this is correct.
Under the strict-scrutiny test, respondents have the burden to prove that the
announce clause is (1) narrowly tailored, to serve (2) a compelling state interest.
In order for respondents to show that the announce clause is narrowly tailored,
they must demonstrate that it does not "unnecessarily circumscrib[e] protected
expression."
The Court of Appeals concluded that respondents had established two interests
as sufficiently compelling to justify the announce clause: preserving the
impartiality of the state judiciary and preserving the appearance of the
impartiality of the state judiciary. Respondents reassert these two interests
before us, arguing that the first is compelling because it protects the due
process rights of litigants, and that the second is compelling because it
preserves public confidence in the judiciary. Respondents are rather vague,
however, about what they mean by "impartiality." Indeed, although the term is
used throughout the Eighth Circuit's opinion, the briefs, the Minnesota Code of
Judicial Conduct, and the ABA Codes of Judicial Conduct, none of these
sources bothers to define it. Clarity on this point is essential before we can
decide whether impartiality is indeed a compelling state interest, and, if so,
whether the announce clause is narrowly tailored to achieve it.
A

Robson

654

The First Amendment

One meaning of "impartiality" in the judicial context--and of course its root
meaning--is the lack of bias for or against either party to the proceeding.
Impartiality in this sense assures equal application of the law. That is, it
guarantees a party that the judge who hears his case will apply the law to him
in the same way he applies it to any other party. This is the traditional sense in
which the term is used. See Webster's New International Dictionary 1247 (2d ed.
1950) (defining "impartial" as "[n]ot partial; esp., not favoring one more than
another; treating all alike; unbiased; equitable; fair; just"). It is also the sense in
which it is used in the cases cited by respondents and amici for the proposition
that an impartial judge is essential to due process.
We think it plain that the announce clause is not narrowly tailored to serve
impartiality (or the appearance of impartiality) in this sense. Indeed, the clause
is barely tailored to serve that interest at all, inasmuch as it does not restrict
speech for or against particular parties, but rather speech for or against
particular issues. To be sure, when a case arises that turns on a legal issue on
which the judge (as a candidate) had taken a particular stand, the party taking
the opposite stand is likely to lose. But not because of any bias against that
party, or favoritism toward the other party. Any party taking that position is
just as likely to lose. The judge is applying the law (as he sees it) evenhandedly.
B
It is perhaps possible to use the term "impartiality" in the judicial context
(though this is certainly not a common usage) to mean lack of preconception in
favor of or against a particular legal view. This sort of impartiality would be
concerned, not with guaranteeing litigants equal application of the law, but
rather with guaranteeing them an equal chance to persuade the court on the
legal points in their case. Impartiality in this sense may well be an interest
served by the announce clause, but it is not a compelling state interest, as
strict scrutiny requires. A judge's lack of predisposition regarding the relevant
legal issues in a case has never been thought a necessary component of equal
justice, and with good reason. For one thing, it is virtually impossible to find a
judge who does not have preconceptions about the law. As then-Justice
Rehnquist observed of our own Court: "Since most Justices come to this bench
no earlier than their middle years, it would be unusual if they had not by that
time formulated at least some tentative notions that would influence them in
their interpretation of the sweeping clauses of the Constitution and their
interaction with one another. It would be not merely unusual, but extraordinary,
if they had not at least given opinions as to constitutional issues in their
previous legal careers." Laird v. Tatum (1972) (memorandum opinion). Indeed,
even if it were possible to select judges who did not have preconceived views on
legal issues, it would hardly be desirable to do so. "Proof that a Justice's mind
at the time he joined the Court was a complete tabula rasa in the area of
constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification, not lack
of bias." Ibid. The Minnesota Constitution positively forbids the selection to
courts of general jurisdiction of judges who are impartial in the sense of having
no views on the law. Minn. Const., Art. VI, §5 ("Judges of the supreme court,
the court of appeals and the district court shall be learned in the law"). And
since avoiding judicial preconceptions on legal issues is neither possible nor

Robson

655

The First Amendment

desirable, pretending otherwise by attempting to preserve the "appearance" of
that type of impartiality can hardly be a compelling state interest either.
C
A third possible meaning of "impartiality" (again not a common one) might be
described as openmindedness. This quality in a judge demands, not that he
have no preconceptions on legal issues, but that he be willing to consider views
that oppose his preconceptions, and remain open to persuasion, when the
issues arise in a pending case. This sort of impartiality seeks to guarantee each
litigant, not an equal chance to win the legal points in the case, but at least
some chance of doing so. It may well be that impartiality in this sense, and the
appearance of it, are desirable in the judiciary, but we need not pursue that
inquiry, since we do not believe the Minnesota Supreme Court adopted the
announce clause for that purpose.
Respondents argue that the announce clause serves the interest in
openmindedness, or at least in the appearance of openmindedness, because it
relieves a judge from pressure to rule a certain way in order to maintain
consistency with statements the judge has previously made. The problem is,
however, that statements in election campaigns are such an infinitesimal
portion of the public commitments to legal positions that judges (or judges-tobe) undertake, that this object of the prohibition is implausible. Before they
arrive on the bench (whether by election or otherwise) judges have often
committed themselves on legal issues that they must later rule upon. More
common still is a judge's confronting a legal issue on which he has expressed
an opinion while on the bench. Most frequently, of course, that prior expression
will have occurred in ruling on an earlier case. But judges often state their
views on disputed legal issues outside the context of adjudication--in classes
that they conduct, and in books and speeches. Like the ABA Codes of Judicial
Conduct, the Minnesota Code not only permits but encourages this. See Minn.
Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 4(B) (2002) ("A judge may write, lecture, teach,
speak and participate in other extra-judicial activities concerning the law ...");
Minn. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 4(B), Comment. (2002) ("To the extent
that time permits, a judge is encouraged to do so ..."). That is quite
incompatible with the notion that the need for openmindedness (or for the
appearance of openmindedness) lies behind the prohibition at issue here.
The short of the matter is this: In Minnesota, a candidate for judicial office may
not say "I think it is constitutional for the legislature to prohibit same-sex
marriages." He may say the very same thing, however, up until the very day
before he declares himself a candidate, and may say it repeatedly (until
litigation is pending) after he is elected. As a means of pursuing the objective of
open-mindedness that respondents now articulate, the announce clause is so
woefully underinclusive as to render belief in that purpose a challenge to the
credulous. ***
IV
To sustain the announce clause, the Eighth Circuit relied heavily on the fact
that a pervasive practice of prohibiting judicial candidates from discussing
disputed legal and political issues developed during the last half of the 20th
century. ***

Robson

656

The First Amendment

The first code regulating judicial conduct was adopted by the ABA in 1924. ***
Even today, although a majority of States have adopted either the announce
clause or its 1990 ABA successor, adoption is not unanimous. Of the 31 States
that select some or all of their appellate and general-jurisdiction judges by
election, 4 have adopted no candidate-speech restriction comparable to the
announce clause, and 1 prohibits only the discussion of "pending litigation."
This practice, relatively new to judicial elections and still not universally
adopted, does not compare well with the traditions deemed worthy of our
attention in prior cases.
There is an obvious tension between the article of Minnesota's popularly
approved Constitution which provides that judges shall be elected, and the
Minnesota Supreme Court's announce clause which places most subjects of
interest to the voters off limits. (The candidate-speech restrictions of all the
other States that have them are also the product of judicial fiat. ) The disparity
is perhaps unsurprising, since the ABA, which originated the announce clause,
has long been an opponent of judicial elections. That opposition may be well
taken (it certainly had the support of the Founders of the Federal Government),
but the First Amendment does not permit it to achieve its goal by leaving the
principle of elections in place while preventing candidates from discussing what
the elections are about.
The Minnesota Supreme Court's canon of judicial conduct prohibiting
candidates for judicial election from announcing their views on disputed legal
and political issues violates the First Amendment. Accordingly, we reverse the
grant of summary judgment to respondents and remand the case for
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, CONCURRING.
I join the opinion of the Court but write separately to express my concerns
about judicial elections generally. ***
Minnesota has chosen to select its judges through contested popular elections
instead of through an appointment system or a combined appointment and
retention election system along the lines of the Missouri Plan. In doing so the
State has voluntarily taken on the risks to judicial bias described above. As a
result, the State's claim that it needs to significantly restrict judges' speech in
order to protect judicial impartiality is particularly troubling. If the State has a
problem with judicial impartiality, it is largely one the State brought upon itself
by continuing the practice of popularly electing judges.

JUSTICE GINSBURG, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, AND JUSTICE
BREYER JOIN, DISSENTING.
Whether state or federal, elected or appointed, judges perform a function
fundamentally different from that of the people's elected representatives.
Legislative and executive officials act on behalf of the voters who placed them in
office; "judge[s] represen[t] the Law." Chisom v. Roemer (1991) (Scalia, J.,
dissenting). Unlike their counterparts in the political branches, judges are
expected to refrain from catering to particular constituencies or committing
themselves on controversial issues in advance of adversarial presentation. Their
mission is to decide "individual cases and controversies" on individual records,
Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc. (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting), neutrally applying
legal principles, and, when necessary, "stand[ing] up to what is generally
supreme in a democracy: the popular will," Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of
Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1180 (1989).
A judiciary capable of performing this function, owing fidelity to no person or
party, is a "longstanding Anglo-American tradition," United States v. Will (1980),
an essential bulwark of constitutional government, a constant guardian of the
rule of law. The guarantee of an independent, impartial judiciary enables
society to "withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political
controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to
establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts." West Virginia Bd.
of Ed. v. Barnette (1943). "Without this, all the reservations of particular rights
or privileges would amount to nothing." THE FEDERALIST NO. 78, p. 466 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961).
The ability of the judiciary to discharge its unique role rests to a large degree on
the manner in which judges are selected. The Framers of the Federal
Constitution sought to advance the judicial function through the structural
protections of Article III, which provide for the selection of judges by the
President on the advice and consent of the Senate, generally for lifetime terms.
Through its own Constitution, Minnesota, in common with most other States,
has decided to allow its citizens to choose judges directly in periodic elections.
But Minnesota has not thereby opted to install a corps of political actors on the
bench; rather, it has endeavored to preserve the integrity of its judiciary by
other means. Recognizing that the influence of political parties is incompatible
with the judge's role, for example, Minnesota has designated all judicial
elections nonpartisan. And it has adopted a provision, here called the Announce
Clause, designed to prevent candidates for judicial office from "publicly making
known how they would decide issues likely to come before them as judges."
The question this case presents is whether the First Amendment stops
Minnesota from furthering its interest in judicial integrity through this precisely
targeted speech restriction.
I
The speech restriction must fail, in the Court's view, because an electoral
process is at stake; if Minnesota opts to elect its judges, the Court asserts, the
State may not rein in what candidates may say.

Robson

658

The First Amendment

I do not agree with this unilocular, "an election is an election," approach.
Instead, I would differentiate elections for political offices, in which the First
Amendment holds full sway, from elections designed to select those whose office
it is to administer justice without respect to persons. Minnesota's choice to elect
its judges, I am persuaded, does not preclude the State from installing an
election process geared to the judicial office.
Legislative and executive officials serve in representative capacities. They are
agents of the people; their primary function is to advance the interests of their
constituencies. Candidates for political offices, in keeping with their
representative role, must be left free to inform the electorate of their positions
on specific issues. Armed with such information, the individual voter will be
equipped to cast her ballot intelligently, to vote for the candidate committed to
positions the voter approves. Campaign statements committing the candidate to
take sides on contentious issues are therefore not only appropriate in political
elections, they are "at the core of our electoral process," for they "enhance the
accountability of government officials to the people whom they represent,"
Judges, however, are not political actors. They do not sit as representatives of
particular persons, communities, or parties; they serve no faction or
constituency. "[I]t is the business of judges to be indifferent to popularity." They
must strive to do what is legally right, all the more so when the result is not the
one "the home crowd" wants. Rehnquist, Dedicatory Address: Act Well Your Part:
Therein All Honor Lies, 7 PEPPERDINE L. REV. 227, 229-300 (1980). Even when
they develop common law or give concrete meaning to constitutional text,
judges act only in the context of individual cases, the outcome of which cannot
depend on the will of the public. See Barnette ("One's right to life, liberty, and
property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and
other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the
outcome of no elections.").
Thus, the rationale underlying unconstrained speech in elections for political
office--that representative government depends on the public's ability to choose
agents who will act at its behest--does not carry over to campaigns for the
bench. ***
II
Proper resolution of this case requires correction of the Court's distorted
construction of the provision before us for review. ***
First and most important, the Court ignores a crucial limiting construction
placed on the Announce Clause by the courts below. The provision does not bar
a candidate from generally "stating [her] views" on legal questions; it prevents
her from "publicly making known how [she] would decide" disputed issues. That
limitation places beyond the scope of the Announce Clause a wide range of
comments that may be highly informative to voters. Consistent with the Eighth
Circuit's construction, such comments may include, for example, statements of
historical fact ("As a prosecutor, I obtained 15 drunk driving convictions");
qualified statements ("Judges should use sparingly their discretion to grant
lenient sentences to drunk drivers"); and statements framed at a sufficient level
of generality ("Drunk drivers are a threat to the safety of every driver"). What
remains within the Announce Clause is the category of statements that

Robson

659

The First Amendment

essentially commit the candidate to a position on a specific issue, such as "I
think all drunk drivers should receive the maximum sentence permitted by
law."
Second, the Court misportrays the scope of the Clause as applied to a
candidate's discussion of past decisions. ***
The Announce Clause is thus more tightly bounded, and campaigns conducted
under that provision more robust, than the Court acknowledges. Judicial
candidates in Minnesota may not only convey general information about
themselves, they may also describe their conception of the role of a judge and
their views on a wide range of subjects of interest to the voters. Further, they
may discuss, criticize, or defend past decisions of interest to voters. What
candidates may not do--simply or with sophistication--is remove themselves
from the constraints characteristic of the judicial office and declare how they
would decide an issue, without regard to the particular context in which it is
presented, sans briefs, oral argument, and, as to an appellate bench, the
benefit of one's colleagues' analyses. Properly construed, the Announce Clause
prohibits only a discrete subcategory of the statements the Court's
misinterpretation encompasses.
*** In his 1996 bid for office, petitioner Gregory Wersal distributed literature
sharply criticizing three Minnesota Supreme Court decisions. Of the court's
holding in the first case--that certain unrecorded confessions must be
suppressed--Wersal asked, "Should we conclude that because the Supreme
Court does not trust police, it allows confessed criminals to go free?" Of the
second case, invalidating a state welfare law, Wersal stated: "The Court should
have deferred to the Legislature. It's the Legislature which should set our
spending policies." And of the third case, a decision involving abortion rights,
Wersal charged that the court's holding was "directly contrary to the opinion of
the U. S. Supreme Court," "unprecedented," and a "pro-abortion stance."
When a complaint was filed against Wersal on the basis of those statements,
the Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board concluded that no discipline was
warranted, in part because it thought the disputed campaign materials did not
violate the Announce Clause. And when, at the outset of his 1998 campaign,
Wersal sought to avoid the possibility of sanction for future statements, he
pursued the option, available to all Minnesota judicial candidates of requesting
an advisory opinion concerning the application of the Announce Clause. In
response to that request, the Board indicated that it did not anticipate any
adverse action against him. Wersal has thus never been sanctioned under the
Announce Clause for any campaign statement he made. On the facts before us,
in sum, the Announce Clause has hardly stifled the robust communication of
ideas and views from judicial candidate to voter.
III
Even as it exaggerates the reach of the Announce Clause, the Court ignores the
significance of that provision to the integrated system of judicial campaign
regulation Minnesota has developed. ***
A
*** The justification for the pledges or promises prohibition follows from these
principles. When a judicial candidate promises to rule a certain way on an issue

Robson

660

The First Amendment

that may later reach the courts, the potential for due process violations is grave
and manifest. If successful in her bid for office, the judicial candidate will
become a judge, and in that capacity she will be under pressure to resist the
pleas of litigants who advance positions contrary to her pledges on the
campaign trail. If the judge fails to honor her campaign promises, she will not
only face abandonment by supporters of her professed views, she will also
"ris[k] being assailed as a dissembler," willing to say one thing to win an
election and to do the opposite once in office.
A judge in this position therefore may be thought to have a "direct, personal,
substantial, [and] pecuniary interest" in ruling against certain litigants, for she
may be voted off the bench and thereby lose her salary and emoluments unless
she honors the pledge that secured her election.
Given this grave danger to litigants from judicial campaign promises, States are
justified in barring expression of such commitments, for they typify the
"situatio[n] . . . in which experience teaches that the probability of actual bias
on the part of the judge . . . is too high to be constitutionally tolerable." Withrow
v. Larkin (1975). ***
In addition to protecting litigants' due process rights, the parties in this case
further agree, the pledges or promises clause advances another compelling state
interest: preserving the public's confidence in the integrity and impartiality of
its judiciary. ***
Prohibiting a judicial candidate from pledging or promising certain results if
elected directly promotes the State's interest in preserving public faith in the
bench. When a candidate makes such a promise during a campaign, the public
will no doubt perceive that she is doing so in the hope of garnering votes. And
the public will in turn likely conclude that when the candidate decides an issue
in accord with that promise, she does so at least in part to discharge her
undertaking to the voters in the previous election and to prevent voter
abandonment in the next. The perception of that unseemly quid pro quo--a
judicial candidate's promises on issues in return for the electorate's votes at the
polls--inevitably diminishes the public's faith in the ability of judges to
administer the law without regard to personal or political self-interest. ***
B
The constitutionality of the pledges or promises clause is thus amply supported;
the provision not only advances due process of law for litigants in Minnesota
courts, it also reinforces the authority of the Minnesota judiciary by promoting
public confidence in the State's judges. The Announce Clause, however, is
equally vital to achieving these compelling ends, for without it, the pledges or
promises provision would be feeble, an arid form, a matter of no real
importance.
Uncoupled from the Announce Clause, the ban on pledges or promises is easily
circumvented. By prefacing a campaign commitment with the caveat, "although
I cannot promise anything," or by simply avoiding the language of promises or
pledges altogether, a candidate could declare with impunity how she would
decide specific issues. Semantic sanitizing of the candidate's commitment

Robson

661

The First Amendment

would not, however, diminish its pernicious effects on actual and perceived
judicial impartiality. ***
***
This Court has recognized in the past, as Justice O'Connor does today, a
"fundamental tension between the ideal character of the judicial office and the
real world of electoral politics." We have no warrant to resolve that tension,
however, by forcing States to choose one pole or the other. Judges are not
politicians, and the First Amendment does not require that they be treated as
politicians simply because they are chosen by popular vote. Nor does the First
Amendment command States who wish to promote the integrity of their judges
in fact and appearance to abandon systems of judicial selection that the people,
in the exercise of their sovereign prerogatives, have devised.
For more than three-quarters of a century, States like Minnesota have
endeavored, through experiment tested by experience, to balance the
constitutional interests in judicial integrity and free expression within the
unique setting of an elected judiciary. P. MCFADDEN, ELECTING JUSTICE: THE LAW
AND ETHICS OF JUDICIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS 86 (1990); Brief for the Conference
of Chief Justices as Amicus Curiae. The Announce Clause, borne of this long
effort, "comes to this Court bearing a weighty title of respect," Teamsters v.
Hanke (1950). I would uphold it as an essential component in Minnesota's
accommodation of the complex and competing concerns in this sensitive area.
Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit.

Our Founders vested authority to appoint federal judges in the President, with
the advice and consent of the Senate, and entrusted those judges to hold their
offices during good behavior. The Constitution permits States to make a
different choice, and most of them have done so. In 39 States, voters elect trial
or appellate judges at the polls. In an effort to preserve public confidence in the
integrity of their judiciaries, many of those States prohibit judges and judicial
candidates from personally soliciting funds for their campaigns. We must
decide whether the First Amendment permits such restrictions on speech.

Robson

662

The First Amendment

We hold that it does. Judges are not politicians, even when they come to the
bench by way of the ballot. And a State's decision to elect its judiciary does not
compel it to treat judicial candidates like campaigners for political office. A
State may assure its people that judges will apply the law without fear or favor-and without having personally asked anyone for money. We affirm the judgment
of the Florida Supreme Court.
I
A
When Florida entered the Union in 1845, its Constitution provided for trial and
appellate judges to be elected by the General Assembly. Florida soon followed
more than a dozen of its sister States in transferring authority to elect judges to
the voting public. *** Trial judges are still elected by popular vote, unless the
local jurisdiction opts instead for merit selection. Fla. Const., Art. V, §10.
Amid the corruption scandals of the 1970s, the Florida Supreme Court adopted
a new Code of Judicial Conduct. 281 So. 2d 21 (1973). In its present form, the
first sentence of Canon 1 reads, "An independent and honorable judiciary is
indispensable to justice in our society." Code of Judicial Conduct for the State
of Florida 6 (2014). Canon 1 instructs judges to observe "high standards of
conduct" so that "the integrity and independence of the judiciary may be
preserved." Canon 2 directs that a judge "shall act at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary."
Other provisions prohibit judges from lending the prestige of their offices to
private interests, engaging in certain business transactions, and personally
participating in soliciting funds for nonprofit organizations. Canons 2B,
5C(3)(b)(i), 5D.
Canon 7C(1) governs fundraising in judicial elections. The Canon, which is
based on a provision in the American Bar Association's Model Code of Judicial
Conduct, provides:
"A candidate, including an incumbent judge, for a judicial office that is filled by
public election between competing candidates shall not personally solicit
campaign funds, or solicit attorneys for publicly stated support, but may
establish committees of responsible persons to secure and manage the
expenditure of funds for the candidate's campaign and to obtain public
statements of support for his or her candidacy. Such committees are not
prohibited from soliciting campaign contributions and public support from any
person or corporation authorized by law."

Florida statutes impose additional restrictions on campaign fundraising in
judicial elections. Contributors may not donate more than $1,000 per election
to a trial court candidate or more than $3,000 per retention election to a
Supreme Court justice. Campaign committee treasurers must file periodic
reports disclosing the names of contributors and the amount of each
contribution.
Judicial candidates can seek guidance about campaign ethics rules from the
Florida Judicial Ethics Advisory Committee. The Committee has interpreted
Canon 7 to allow a judicial candidate to serve as treasurer of his own campaign

Robson

663

The First Amendment

committee, learn the identity of campaign contributors, and send thank you
notes to donors.
Like Florida, most other States prohibit judicial candidates from soliciting
campaign funds personally, but allow them to raise money through committees.
According to the American Bar Association, 30 of the 39 States that elect trial
or appellate judges have adopted restrictions similar to Canon 7C(1). Brief for
American Bar Association as Amicus Curiae 4.

Lanell Williams-Yulee, who refers to herself as Yulee, has practiced law in

county court for Hillsborough County, a jurisdiction of about 1.3 million people
that includes the city of Tampa. Shortly after filing paperwork to enter the race,
Yulee drafted a letter announcing her candidacy. The letter described her

needed to launch the campaign and get our message out to the public. I ask for
your support [i]n meeting the primary election fund raiser goals. Thank you in
advance for your support."

Yulee signed the letter and mailed it to local voters. She also posted the letter
on her campaign Web site.
Yulee's bid for the bench did not unfold as she had hoped. She lost the primary
to the incumbent judge. Then the Florida Bar filed a complaint against her. As
relevant here, the Bar charged her with violating Rule 4-8.2(b) of the Rules
Regulating the Florida Bar. That Rule requires judicial candidates to comply
with applicable provisions of Florida's Code of Judicial Conduct, including the
ban on personal solicitation of campaign funds in Canon 7C(1).
Yulee admitted that she had signed and sent the fundraising letter. But she
argued that the Bar could not discipline her for that conduct because the First
Amendment protects a judicial candidate's right to solicit campaign funds in an
election. The Florida Supreme Court appointed a referee, who held a hearing
and recommended a finding of guilt. As a sanction, the referee recommended
that Yulee be publicly reprimanded and ordered to pay the costs of the
proceeding ($1,860).
The Florida Supreme Court adopted the referee's recommendations. The court
explained that Canon 7C(1) "clearly restricts a judicial candidate's speech" and
therefore must be "narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest." The
court held that the Canon satisfies that demanding inquiry. First, the court
reasoned, prohibiting judicial candidates from personally soliciting funds
furthers Florida's compelling interest in "preserving the integrity of [its]
judiciary and maintaining the public's confidence in an impartial judiciary." In
the court's view, "personal solicitation of campaign funds, even by mass
mailing, raises an appearance of impropriety and calls into question, in the
public's mind, the judge's impartiality." Second, the court concluded that
Canon 7C(1) is narrowly tailored to serve that compelling interest because it "

The First Amendment

'insulate[s] judicial candidates from the solicitation and receipt of funds while
leaving open, ample alternative means for candidates to raise the resources
necessary to run their campaigns.' "
The Florida Supreme Court acknowledged that some Federal Courts of Appeals-"whose judges have lifetime appointments and thus do not have to engage in
fundraising"--had invalidated restrictions similar to Canon 7C(1). But the court
found it persuasive that every State Supreme Court that had considered similar
fundraising provisions--along with several Federal Courts of Appeals--had
upheld the laws against First Amendment challenges. Florida's chief justice and
one associate justice dissented. We granted certiorari.
II [plurality]
The First Amendment provides that Congress "shall make no law . . . abridging
the freedom of speech." The Fourteenth Amendment makes that prohibition
applicable to the States. The parties agree that Canon 7C(1) restricts Yulee's
speech on the basis of its content by prohibiting her from soliciting
contributions to her election campaign. The parties disagree, however, about
the level of scrutiny that should govern our review.
We have applied exacting scrutiny to laws restricting the solicitation of
contributions to charity, upholding the speech limitations only if they are
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. See Riley v. National Federation
of Blind of N. C., Inc. (1988). As we have explained, noncommercial solicitation
"is characteristically intertwined with informative and perhaps persuasive
speech." Applying a lesser standard of scrutiny to such speech would threaten
"the exercise of rights so vital to the maintenance of democratic institutions."
Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington) (1939).
The principles underlying these charitable solicitation cases apply with even
greater force here. Before asking for money in her fundraising letter, Yulee
explained her fitness for the bench and expressed her vision for the judiciary.
Her stated purpose for the solicitation was to get her "message out to the
public." As we have long recognized, speech about public issues and the
qualifications of candidates for elected office commands the highest level of
First Amendment protection. Indeed, in our only prior case concerning speech
restrictions on a candidate for judicial office, this Court and both parties
assumed that strict scrutiny applied. Republican Party of Minn. v. White (2002).
Although the Florida Supreme Court upheld Canon 7C(1) under strict scrutiny,
the Florida Bar and several amici contend that we should subject the Canon to
a more permissive standard: that it be "closely drawn" to match a "sufficiently
important interest." Buckley v. Valeo (1976) (per curiam). The "closely drawn"
standard is a poor fit for this case. The Court adopted that test in Buckley to
address a claim that campaign contribution limits violated a contributor's
"freedom of political association." Here, Yulee does not claim that Canon 7C(1)
violates her right to free association; she argues that it violates her right to free
speech. And the Florida Bar can hardly dispute that the Canon infringes Yulee's
freedom to discuss candidates and public issues--namely, herself and her
qualifications to be a judge. The Bar's call to import the "closely drawn" test
from the contribution limit context into a case about solicitation therefore has
little avail.

Robson

665

The First Amendment

As several of the Bar's amici note, we applied the "closely drawn" test to
solicitation restrictions in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n (2003),
overruled in part by Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n (2010). But the
Court in that case determined that the solicitation restrictions operated
primarily to prevent circumvention of the contribution limits, which were the
subject of the "closely drawn" test in the first place. McConnell offers no help to
the Bar here, because Florida did not adopt Canon 7C(1) as an
anticircumvention measure.
In sum, we hold today what we assumed in White: A State may restrict the
speech of a judicial candidate only if the restriction is narrowly tailored to serve
a compelling interest.
III
The Florida Bar faces a demanding task in defending Canon 7C(1) against
Yulee's First Amendment challenge. We have emphasized that "it is the rare
case" in which a State demonstrates that a speech restriction is narrowly
tailored to serve a compelling interest. Burson v. Freeman (1992) (plurality
opinion). But those cases do arise. See ibid.; Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project
(2010); McConnell, 540 U. S., at 314 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.); cf. Adarand
Constructors, Inc. v. Peña (1995) ("we wish to dispel the notion that strict
scrutiny is 'strict in theory, but fatal in fact'"). Here, Canon 7C(1) advances the
State's compelling interest in preserving public confidence in the integrity of the
judiciary, and it does so through means narrowly tailored to avoid
unnecessarily abridging speech. This is therefore one of the rare cases in which
a speech restriction withstands strict scrutiny.
A
The Florida Supreme Court adopted Canon 7C(1) to promote the State's
interests in "protecting the integrity of the judiciary" and "maintaining the
public's confidence in an impartial judiciary." The way the Canon advances
those interests is intuitive: Judges, charged with exercising strict neutrality and
independence, cannot supplicate campaign donors without diminishing public
confidence in judicial integrity. This principle dates back at least eight centuries
to Magna Carta, which proclaimed, "To no one will we sell, to no one will we
refuse or delay, right or justice." Cl. 40 (1215). The same concept underlies the
common law judicial oath, which binds a judge to "do right to all manner of
people . . . without fear or favour, affection or ill-will," 10 Encyclopaedia of the
Laws of England 105 (2d ed. 1908), and the oath that each of us took to
"administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor
and to the rich." Simply put, Florida and most other States have concluded that
the public may lack confidence in a judge's ability to administer justice without
fear or favor if he comes to office by asking for favors.
The interest served by Canon 7C(1) has firm support in our precedents. We
have recognized the "vital state interest" in safeguarding "public confidence in
the fairness and integrity of the nation's elected judges." Caperton v. A. T.
Massey Coal Co. (2009). The importance of public confidence in the integrity of
judges stems from the place of the judiciary in the government. Unlike the
executive or the legislature, the judiciary "has no influence over either the
sword or the purse; . . . neither force nor will but merely judgment." The

Robson

666

The First Amendment

Federalist No. 78. The judiciary's authority therefore depends in large measure
on the public's willingness to respect and follow its decisions. As Justice
Frankfurter once put it for the Court, "justice must satisfy the appearance of
justice." Offutt v. United States (1954). It follows that public perception of
judicial integrity is "a state interest of the highest order." Caperton (quoting
White (KENNEDY, J., concurring)).
The principal dissent observes that bans on judicial candidate solicitation lack
a lengthy historical pedigree. We do not dispute that fact, but it has no
relevance here. As the precedent cited by the principal dissent demonstrates, a
history and tradition of regulation are important factors in determining whether
to recognize "new categories of unprotected speech." Brown v. Entertainment
Merchants Assn (2011). But nobody argues that solicitation of campaign funds
by judicial candidates is a category of unprotected speech. As explained above,
the First Amendment fully applies to Yulee's speech. The question is instead
whether that Amendment permits the particular regulation of speech at issue
here.
The parties devote considerable attention to our cases analyzing campaign
finance restrictions in political elections. But a State's interest in preserving
public confidence in the integrity of its judiciary extends beyond its interest in
preventing the appearance of corruption in legislative and executive elections.
As we explained in White, States may regulate judicial elections differently than
they regulate political elections, because the role of judges differs from the role
of politicians. 536 U. S., at 783; id., at 805 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). Politicians
are expected to be appropriately responsive to the preferences of their
supporters. Indeed, such "responsiveness is key to the very concept of selfgovernance through elected officials." McCutcheon v. Federal Election Comm'n
(2014) (plurality opinion). The same is not true of judges. In deciding cases, a
judge is not to follow the preferences of his supporters, or provide any special
consideration to his campaign donors. A judge instead must "observe the
utmost fairness," striving to be "perfectly and completely independent, with
nothing to influence or controul him but God and his conscience." Address of
John Marshall, in Proceedings and Debates of the Virginia State Convention of
1829-1830 (1830). As in White, therefore, our precedents applying the First
Amendment to political elections have little bearing on the issues here.
The vast majority of elected judges in States that allow personal solicitation
serve with fairness and honor. But "[e]ven if judges were able to refrain from
favoring donors, the mere possibility that judges' decisions may be motivated by
the desire to repay campaign contributions is likely to undermine the public's
confidence in the judiciary." White (O'Connor, J., concurring). In the eyes of the
public, a judge's personal solicitation could result (even unknowingly) in "a
possible temptation . . . which might lead him not to hold the balance nice,
clear and true." Tumey v. Ohio (1927). That risk is especially pronounced
because most donors are lawyers and litigants who may appear before the judge
they are supporting.
The concept of public confidence in judicial integrity does not easily reduce to
precise definition, nor does it lend itself to proof by documentary record. But no
one denies that it is genuine and compelling. In short, it is the regrettable but
unavoidable appearance that judges who personally ask for money may

Robson

667

The First Amendment

diminish their integrity that prompted the Supreme Court of Florida and most
other States to sever the direct link between judicial candidates and campaign
contributors. *** A State's decision to elect its judges does not require it to
tolerate these risks. The Florida Bar's interest is compelling.
B
Yulee acknowledges the State's compelling interest in judicial integrity. She
argues, however, that the Canon's failure to restrict other speech equally
damaging to judicial integrity and its appearance undercuts the Bar's position.
In particular, she notes that Canon 7C(1) allows a judge's campaign committee
to solicit money, which arguably reduces public confidence in the integrity of
the judiciary just as much as a judge's personal solicitation. Yulee also points
out that Florida permits judicial candidates to write thank you notes to
campaign donors, which ensures that candidates know who contributes and
who does not.
It is always somewhat counterintuitive to argue that a law violates the First
Amendment by abridging too little speech. We have recognized, however, that
underinclusiveness can raise "doubts about whether the government is in fact
pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or
viewpoint." Brown. In a textbook illustration of that principle, we invalidated a
city's ban on ritual animal sacrifices because the city failed to regulate vast
swaths of conduct that similarly diminished its asserted interests in public
health and animal welfare. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah (1993).
Underinclusiveness can also reveal that a law does not actually advance a
compelling interest. For example, a State's decision to prohibit newspapers, but
not electronic media, from releasing the names of juvenile defendants suggested
that the law did not advance its stated purpose of protecting youth privacy.
Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co. (1979).
Although a law's underinclusivity raises a red flag, the First Amendment
imposes no freestanding "underinclusiveness limitation." R. A. V. v. St. Paul
(1992). A State need not address all aspects of a problem in one fell swoop;
policymakers may focus on their most pressing concerns. We have accordingly
upheld laws--even under strict scrutiny--that conceivably could have restricted
even greater amounts of speech in service of their stated interests. Burson; see
McConnell; Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego (1981) (plurality opinion); Buckley.
Viewed in light of these principles, Canon 7C(1) raises no fatal underinclusivity
concerns. The solicitation ban aims squarely at the conduct most likely to
undermine public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary: personal requests
for money by judges and judicial candidates. The Canon applies evenhandedly
to all judges and judicial candidates, regardless of their viewpoint or chosen
means of solicitation. And unlike some laws that we have found impermissibly
underinclusive, Canon 7C(1) is not riddled with exceptions. See City of Ladue v.
Gilleo (1994). Indeed, the Canon contains zero exceptions to its ban on personal
solicitation.
Yulee relies heavily on the provision of Canon 7C(1) that allows solicitation by a
candidate's campaign committee. But Florida, along with most other States, has
reasonably concluded that solicitation by the candidate personally creates a

Robson

668

The First Amendment

categorically different and more severe risk of undermining public confidence
than does solicitation by a campaign committee. The identity of the solicitor
matters, as anyone who has encountered a Girl Scout selling cookies outside a
grocery store can attest. When the judicial candidate himself asks for money,
the stakes are higher for all involved. The candidate has personally invested his
time and effort in the fundraising appeal; he has placed his name and
reputation behind the request. The solicited individual knows that, and also
knows that the solicitor might be in a position to singlehandedly make
decisions of great weight: The same person who signed the fundraising letter
might one day sign the judgment. This dynamic inevitably creates pressure for
the recipient to comply, and it does so in a way that solicitation by a third party
does not. Just as inevitably, the personal involvement of the candidate in the
solicitation creates the public appearance that the candidate will remember who
says yes, and who says no.
In short, personal solicitation by judicial candidates implicates a different
problem than solicitation by campaign committees. However similar the two
solicitations may be in substance, a State may conclude that they present
markedly different appearances to the public. Florida's choice to allow
solicitation by campaign commit-tees does not undermine its decision to ban
solicitation by judges.
Likewise, allowing judicial candidates to write thank you notes to campaign
donors does not detract from the State's interest in preserving public confidence
in the integrity of the judiciary. Yulee argues that permitting thank you notes
heightens the likelihood of actual bias by ensuring that judicial candidates
know who supported their campaigns, and ensuring that the supporter knows
that the candidate knows. Maybe so. But the State's compelling interest is
implicated most directly by the candidate's personal solicitation itself. A failure
to ban thank you notes for contributions not solicited by the candidate does not
undercut the Bar's rationale.
In addition, the State has a good reason for allowing candidates to write thank
you notes and raise money through committees. These accommodations reflect
Florida's effort to respect the First Amendment interests of candidates and their
contributors--to resolve the "fundamental tension between the ideal character of
the judicial office and the real world of electoral politics." Chisom v. Roemer
(1991). They belie the principal dissent's suggestion that Canon 7C(1) reflects
general "hostility toward judicial campaigning" and has "nothing to do with the
appearances created by judges' asking for money." Nothing?
The principal dissent also suggests that Canon 7C(1) is underinclusive because
Florida does not ban judicial candidates from asking individuals for personal
gifts or loans. But Florida law treats a personal "gift" or "loan" as a campaign
contribution if the donor makes it "for the purpose of influencing the results of
an election," and Florida's Judicial Qualifications Commission has determined
that a judicial candidate violates Canon 7C(1) by personally soliciting such a
loan. In any event, Florida can ban personal solicitation of campaign funds by
judicial candidates without making them obey a comprehensive code to leading
an ethical life. Underinclusivity creates a First Amendment concern when the
State regulates one aspect of a problem while declining to regulate a different
aspect of the problem that affects its stated interest in a comparable way. See

Robson

669

The First Amendment

Florida Star v. B. J. F. (1989). The principal dissent offers no basis to conclude
that judicial candidates are in the habit of soliciting personal loans, football
tickets, or anything of the sort. Even under strict scrutiny, "[t]he First
Amendment does not require States to regulate for problems that do not exist."
Burson.
Taken to its logical conclusion, the position advanced by Yulee and the
principal dissent is that Florida may ban the solicitation of funds by judicial
candidates only if the State bans all solicitation of funds in judicial elections.
The First Amendment does not put a State to that all-or-nothing choice. We will
not punish Florida for leaving open more, rather than fewer, avenues of
expression, especially when there is no indication that the selective restriction
of speech reflects a pretextual motive.
C
After arguing that Canon 7C(1) violates the First Amendment because it
restricts too little speech, Yulee argues that the Canon violates the First
Amendment because it restricts too much. In her view, the Canon is not
narrowly tailored to advance the State's compelling interest through the least
restrictive means. See United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. (2000).
By any measure, Canon 7C(1) restricts a narrow slice of speech. A reader of
Justice Kennedy's dissent could be forgiven for concluding that the Court has
just upheld a latter-day version of the Alien and Sedition Acts, approving "state
censorship" that "locks the First Amendment out," imposes a "gag" on
candidates, and inflicts "dead weight" on a "silenced" public debate. But in
reality, Canon 7C(1) leaves judicial candidates free to discuss any issue with
any person at any time. Candidates can write letters, give speeches, and put up
billboards. They can contact potential supporters in person, on the phone, or
online. They can promote their campaigns on radio, television, or other media.
They cannot say, "Please give me money." They can, however, direct their
campaign committees to do so. Whatever else may be said of the Canon, it is
surely not a "wildly disproportionate restriction upon speech." (Scalia, J.,
dissenting).
Indeed, Yulee concedes--and the principal dissent seems to agree --that Canon
7C(1) is valid in numerous applications. Yulee acknowledges that Florida can
prohibit judges from soliciting money from lawyers and litigants appearing
before them. In addition, she says the State "might" be able to ban "direct oneto-one solicitation of lawyers and individuals or businesses that could
reasonably appear in the court for which the individual is a candidate." She
also suggests that the Bar could forbid "in person" solicitation by judicial
candidates. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7; cf. Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn. (1978)
(permitting State to ban in person solicitation of clients by lawyers). But Yulee
argues that the Canon cannot constitutionally be applied to her chosen form of
solicitation: a letter posted online and distributed via mass mailing. No one, she
contends, will lose confidence in the integrity of the judiciary based on personal
solicitation to such a broad audience.
This argument misperceives the breadth of the compelling interest that
underlies Canon 7C(1). Florida has reasonably determined that personal
appeals for money by a judicial candidate inherently create an appearance of

Robson

670

The First Amendment

impropriety that may cause the public to lose confidence in the integrity of the
judiciary. That interest may be implicated to varying degrees in particular
contexts, but the interest remains whenever the public perceives the judge
personally asking for money.
Moreover, the lines Yulee asks us to draw are unworkable. Even under her
theory of the case, a mass mailing would create an appearance of impropriety if
addressed to a list of all lawyers and litigants with pending cases. So would a
speech soliciting contributions from the 100 most frequently appearing
attorneys in the jurisdiction. Yulee says she might accept a ban on one-to-one
solicitation, but is the public impression really any different if a judicial
candidate tries to buttonhole not one prospective donor but two at a time? Ten?
Yulee also agrees that in person solicitation creates a problem. But would the
public's concern recede if the request for money came in a phone call or a text
message?
We decline to wade into this swamp. The First Amendment requires that Canon
7C(1) be narrowly tailored, not that it be "perfectly tailored." Burson. The
impossibility of perfect tailoring is especially apparent when the State's
compelling interest is as intangible as public confidence in the integrity of the
judiciary. Yulee is of course correct that some personal solicitations raise
greater concerns than others. A judge who passes the hat in the courthouse
creates a more serious appearance of impropriety than does a judicial candidate
who makes a tasteful plea for support on the radio. But most problems arise in
greater and lesser gradations, and the First Amendment does not confine a
State to addressing evils in their most acute form. Here, Florida has concluded
that all personal solicitations by judicial candidates create a public appearance
that undermines confidence in the integrity of the judiciary; banning all
personal solicitations by judicial candidates is narrowly tailored to address that
concern.
In considering Yulee's tailoring arguments, we are mindful that most States
with elected judges have determined that drawing a line between personal
solicitation by candidates and solicitation by committees is necessary to
preserve public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. These considered
judgments deserve our respect, especially because they reflect sensitive choices
by States in an area central to their own governance--how to select those who
"sit as their judges." Gregory v. Ashcroft (1991).
Finally, Yulee contends that Florida can accomplish its compelling interest
through the less restrictive means of recusal rules and campaign contribution
limits. We disagree. A rule requiring judges to recuse themselves from every
case in which a lawyer or litigant made a campaign contribution would disable
many jurisdictions. And a flood of postelection recusal motions could "erode
public confidence in judicial impartiality" and thereby exacerbate the very
appearance problem the State is trying to solve. Caperton (Roberts, C. J.,
dissenting). Moreover, the rule that Yulee envisions could create a perverse
incentive for litigants to make campaign contributions to judges solely as a
means to trigger their later recusal--a form of peremptory strike against a judge
that would enable transparent forum shopping.

Robson

671

The First Amendment

As for campaign contribution limits, Florida already applies them to judicial
elections. A State may decide that the threat to public confidence created by
personal solicitation exists apart from the amount of money that a judge or
judicial candidate seeks. Even if Florida decreased its contribution limit, the appearance that judges who personally solicit funds might improperly favor their
campaign donors would remain. Although the Court has held that contribution
limits advance the interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption and its
appearance in political elections, we have never held that adopting contribution
limits precludes a State from pursuing its compelling interests through
additional means. And in any event, a State has compelling interests in
regulating judicial elections that extend beyond its interests in regulating
political elections, because judges are not politicians.
In sum, because Canon 7C(1) is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling
government interest, the First Amendment poses no obstacle to its enforcement
in this case. As a result of our decision, Florida may continue to prohibit
judicial candidates from personally soliciting campaign funds, while allowing
them to raise money through committees and to otherwise communicate their
electoral messages in practically any way. The principal dissent faults us for not
answering a slew of broader questions, such as whether Florida may cap a
judicial candidate's spending or ban independent expenditures by corporations.
Post, at 8-9. Yulee has not asked these questions, and for good reason--they are
far afield from the narrow regulation actually at issue in this case.
We likewise have no cause to consider whether the citizens of States that elect
their judges have decided anything about the "oracular sanctity of judges" or
whether judges are due "a hearty helping of humble pie." The principal dissent
could be right that the decision to adopt judicial elections "probably springs," at
least in part, from a desire to make judges more accountable to the public,
although the history on this matter is more complicated. In any event, it is a
long way from general notions of judicial accountability to the principal
dissent's view, which evokes nothing so much as Delacroix's painting of Liberty
leading a determined band of citoyens, this time against a robed aristocracy
scurrying to shore up the ramparts of the judicial castle through disingenuous
ethical rules. We claim no similar insight into the People's passions, hazard no
assertions about ulterior motives of those who promulgated Canon 7C(1), and
firmly reject the charge of a deceptive "pose of neutrality" on the part of those
who uphold it.

The desirability of judicial elections is a question that has sparked
disagreement for more than 200 years. Hamilton believed that appointing
judges to positions with life tenure constituted "the best expedient which can be
devised in any government to secure a steady, upright, and impartial
administration of the laws." The Federalist No. 78, at 465. Jefferson thought
that making judges "dependent on none but themselves" ran counter to the
principle of "a government founded on the public will." 12 THE WORKS OF
THOMAS JEFFERSON 5 (P. Ford ed. 1905). The federal courts reflect the view of
Hamilton; most States have sided with Jefferson. Both methods have given our
Nation jurists of wisdom and rectitude who have devoted themselves to
maintaining "the public's respect . . . and a reserve of public goodwill, without

becoming subservient to public opinion." Rehnquist, Judicial Independence, 38
U. RICH. L. REV. 579, 596 (2004).
It is not our place to resolve this enduring debate. Our limited task is to apply
the Constitution to the question presented in this case. Judicial candidates
have a First Amendment right to speak in support of their campaigns. States
have a compelling interest in preserving public confidence in their judiciaries.
When the State adopts a narrowly tailored restriction like the one at issue here,
those principles do not conflict. A State's decision to elect judges does not
compel it to compromise public confidence in their integrity.
The judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is
Affirmed.
JUSTICE BREYER, CONCURRING.
As I have previously said, I view this Court's doctrine referring to tiers of
scrutiny as guidelines informing our approach to the case at hand, not tests to
be mechanically applied. See, e.g., United States v. Alvarez (2012) (Breyer, J.,
concurring in judgment); Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC (2000)
(Breyer, J., concurring). On that understanding, I join the Court's opinion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG, WITH WHOM JUSTICE BREYER JOINS AS TO PART II, CONCURRING IN
PART AND CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
I
I join the Court's opinion save for Part II. As explained in my dissenting opinion
in Republican Party of Minnesota v. White (2002), I would not apply exacting
scrutiny to a State's endeavor sensibly to "differentiate elections for political
offices . . . , from elections designed to select those whose office it is to
administer justice without respect to persons."
II
I write separately to reiterate the substantial latitude, in my view, States should
possess to enact campaign-finance rules geared to judicial elections. "Judges,"
the Court rightly recognizes, "are not politicians," so "States may regulate
judicial elections differently than they regulate political elections." And because
"the role of judges differs from the role of politicians," this Court's "precedents
applying the First Amendment to political elections [should] have little bearing"
on elections to judicial office.
The Court's recent campaign-finance decisions, trained on political actors,
should not hold sway for judicial elections. In Citizens United v. Federal Election
Comm'n (2010), the Court invalidated a campaign-finance restriction designed
to check the outsized influence of monied interests in politics. Addressing the
Government's asserted interest in preventing "influence over or access to
elected officials," the Court observed that "[f]avoritism and influence" are
inevitable "in representative politics." A plurality of the Court responded
similarly in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Comm'n (2014), when it addressed
the prospect that wealthy donors would have ready access to, and could
therefore influence, elected policymakers. "[A] central feature of democracy," the
Robson

673

The First Amendment

plurality maintained, is "that constituents support candidates who share their
beliefs and interests, and candidates who are elected can be expected to be
responsive to those concerns."
For reasons spelled out in the dissenting opinions in Citizens United and
McCutcheon, I would have upheld the legislation there at issue. But even if one
agrees with those judgments, they are geared to elections for representative
posts, and should have "little bearing" on judicial elections. ***
States may therefore impose different campaign-finance rules for judicial
elections than for political elections. Experience illustrates why States may wish
to do so. When the political campaign-finance apparatus is applied to judicial
elections, the distinction of judges from politicians dims. Donors, who gain
audience and influence through contributions to political campaigns, anticipate
that investment in
In recent years, moreover, issue-oriented organizations and political action
committees have spent millions of dollars opposing the reelection of judges
whose decisions do not tow a party line or are alleged to be out of step with
public opinion. Following the Iowa Supreme Court's 2009 invalidation of the
State's same-sex marriage ban, for example, national organizations poured
money into a successful campaign to remove three justices from that Court.
Attack advertisements funded by issue or politically driven organizations
portrayed the justices as political actors; they lambasted the Iowa Supreme
Court for "usurp[ing] the will of voters."
Similarly portraying judges as belonging to another political branch, huge
amounts have been spent on advertisements opposing retention of judges
because they rendered unpopular decisions in favor of criminal defendants. In
North Carolina, for example, in 2014, a political action committee aired "a
widely condemned TV spot accusing [North Carolina Supreme Court Justice
Robin] Hudson of being 'soft' on child-molesters." And in West Virginia, as
described in Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), coal executive Don
Blankenship lavishly funded a political action committee called "And For The
Sake Of The Kids." That group bought advertisements accusing Justice Warren
McGraw of freeing a "child rapist" and allowing that "rapist" to "work as a
janitor at a West Virginia school."
Disproportionate spending to influence court judgments threatens both the
appearance and actuality of judicial independence. Numerous studies report
that the money pressure groups spend on judicial elections "can affect judicial
decision-making across a broad range of cases." Brief for Professors of Law,

How does the electorate perceive outsized spending on judicial elections?
Multiple surveys over the past 13 years indicate that voters overwhelmingly
believe direct contributions to judges' campaigns have at least "some influence"
on judicial decisionmaking. ***

The First Amendment

"A State's decision to elect its judges does not require it to tolerate these risks."
What may be true of happy families, L. Tolstoy, Anna Karenina 1 (R. Pevear and
L. Volokhonsky transls. 2000) ("All happy families are alike"), or of roses, G.
Stein, Sacred Emily, in Geography and Plays 178, 187 (1922) (reprint 1968)
("Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose"), does not hold true in elections of every kind.
States should not be put to the polar choices of either equating judicial
elections to political elections, or else abandoning public participation in the
selection of judges altogether. Instead, States should have leeway to "balance
the constitutional interests in judicial integrity and free expression within the
unique setting of an elected judiciary." White (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).
JUSTICE SCALIA, WITH WHOM JUSTICE THOMAS JOINS, DISSENTING.
An ethics canon adopted by the Florida Supreme Court bans a candidate in a
judicial election from asking anyone, under any circumstances, for a
contribution to his campaign. Faithful application of our precedents would have
made short work of this wildly disproportionate restriction upon speech. Intent
upon upholding the Canon, however, the Court flattens one settled First
Amendment principle after another.
I
The first axiom of the First Amendment is this: As a general rule, the state has
no power to ban speech on the basis of its content. One need not equate judges
with politicians to see that this principle does not grow weaker merely because
the censored speech is a judicial candidate's request for a campaign
contribution. Our cases hold that speech enjoys the full protection of the First
Amendment unless a widespread and longstanding tradition ratifies its
regulation. No such tradition looms here. Georgia became the first State to elect
its judges in 1812, and judicial elections had spread to a large majority of the
States by the time of the Civil War. Yet there appears to have been no regulation
of judicial candidates' speech throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.
The American Bar Association first proposed ethics rules concerning speech of
judicial candidates in 1924, but these rules did not achieve widespread
adoption until after the Second World War.
Rules against soliciting campaign contributions arrived more recently still. The
ABA first proposed a canon advising against it in 1972, and a canon prohibiting
it only in 1990. Even now, 9 of the 39 States that elect judges allow judicial
candidates to ask for campaign contributions. In the absence of any longsettled custom about judicial candidates' speech in general or their solicitations
in particular, we have no basis for relaxing the rules that normally apply to
laws that suppress speech because of content.
*** Because Canon 7C(1) restricts fully protected speech on the basis of
content, it presumptively violates the First Amendment. We may uphold it only
if the State meets its burden of showing that the Canon survives strict scrutiny-that is to say, only if it shows that the Canon is narrowly tailored to serve a
compelling interest. I do not for a moment question the Court's conclusion that
States have different compelling interests when regulating judicial elections
than when regulating political ones. Unlike a legislator, a judge must be

Robson

675

The First Amendment

impartial--without bias for or against any party or attorney who comes before
him. I accept for the sake of argument that States have a compelling interest in
ensuring that its judges are seen to be impartial. I will likewise assume that a
judicial candidate's request to a litigant or attorney presents a danger of
coercion that a political candidate's request to a constituent does not. But
Canon 7C(1) does not narrowly target concerns about impartiality or its
appearance; it ap-plies even when the person asked for a financial contribution
has no chance of ever appearing in the candidate's court. And Florida does not
invoke concerns about coercion, presumably because the Canon bans
solicitations regardless of whether their object is a lawyer, litigant, or other
person vulnerable to judicial pressure. So Canon 7C(1) fails exacting scrutiny
and infringes the First Amendment. This case should have been just that
straightforward.
II
***
[ABC omitted]
D
Even if Florida could show that banning all personal appeals for campaign
funds is necessary to protect public confidence in judicial integrity, the Court
must overpower one last sentinel of free speech before it can uphold Canon
7C(1). Among its other functions, the First Amendment is a kind of Equal
Protection Clause for ideas. The state ordinarily may not regulate one message
because it harms a government interest yet refuse to regulate other messages
that impair the interest in a comparable way. Applying this principle, we
invalidated a law that prohibited picketing dwellings but made an exception for
picketing about labor issues; the State could not show that labor picketing
harmed its asserted interest in residential privacy any less than other kinds of
picketing. Carey v. Brown (1980). In another case, we set aside a ban on
showing movies containing nudity in drive-in theaters, because the government
did not demonstrate that movies with nude scenes would distract passing
drivers any more than, say, movies with violent scenes. Erznoznik v.
Jacksonville (1975).
The Court's decision disregards these principles. The Court tells us that "all
personal solicitations by judicial candidates create a public appearance that
undermines confidence in the integrity of the judiciary." But Canon 7C(1) does
not restrict all personal solicitations; it restricts only personal solicitations
related to campaigns. The part of the Canon challenged here prohibits personal
pleas for "campaign funds," and the Canon elsewhere prohibits personal
appeals to attorneys for "publicly stated support." So although Canon 7C(1)
prevents Yulee from asking a lawyer for a few dollars to help her buy campaign
pamphlets, it does not prevent her asking the same lawyer for a personal loan,
access to his law firm's luxury suite at the local football stadium, or even a
donation to help her fight the Florida Bar's charges. What could possibly justify
these distinctions? Surely the Court does not believe that requests for campaign
favors erode public confidence in a way that requests for favors unrelated to
elections do not. Could anyone say with a straight face that it looks worse for a
candidate to say "please give my campaign $25" than to say "please give me
$25"?*

Robson

676

The First Amendment

Fumbling around for a fig-leaf, the Court says that "the First Amendment
imposes no freestanding 'underinclusiveness limitation.' " This analysis elides
the distinction between selectivity on the basis of content and selectivity on
other grounds. Because the First Amendment does not prohibit
underinclusiveness as such, lawmakers may target a problem only at certain
times or in certain places. Because the First Amendment does prohibit content
discrimination as such, lawmakers may not target a problem only in certain
messages. Explaining this distinction, we have said that the First Amendment
would allow banning obscenity "only in certain media or markets" but would
preclude banning "only that obscenity which includes offensive political
messages." R. A. V. v. St. Paul (1992). This case involves selectivity on the basis
of content. The Florida Supreme Court has decided to eliminate the
appearances associated with "personal appeals for money," when the appeals
seek money for a campaign but not when the appeals seek money for other
purposes. That distinction violates the First Amendment. ***
The Court tries to strike a pose of neutrality between appointment and election
of judges, but no one should be deceived. A Court that sees impropriety in a
candidate's request for any contributions to his election campaign does not
much like judicial selection by the people. One cannot have judicial elections
without judicial campaigns, and judicial campaigns without funds for
campaigning, and funds for campaigning without asking for them. When a
society decides that its judges should be elected, it necessarily decides that
selection by the people is more important than the oracular sanctity of judges,
their immunity from the (shudder!) indignity of begging for funds, and their
exemption from those shadows of impropriety that fall over the proletarian
public officials who must run for office. A free society, accustomed to electing its
rulers, does not much care whether the rulers operate through statute and
executive order, or through judicial distortion of statute, executive order, and
constitution. The prescription that judges be elected probably springs from the
people's realization that their judges can become their rulers--and (it must be
said) from just a deep-down feeling that members of the Third Branch will profit
from a hearty helping of humble pie, and from a severe reduction of their great
remove from the (ugh!) People. (It should not be thought that I myself harbor
such irreverent and revolutionary feelings; but I think it likely--and year by year
more likely--that those who favor the election of judges do so.) In any case,
hostility to campaigning by judges entitles the people of Florida to amend their
Constitution to replace judicial elections with the selection of judges by lawyers'
committees; it does not entitle the Florida Supreme Court to adopt, or this
Court to endorse, a rule of judicial conduct that abridges candidates' speech in
the judicial elections that the Florida Constitution prescribes.

This Court has not been shy to enforce the First Amendment in recent Terms-even in cases that do not involve election speech. It has accorded robust
protection to depictions of animal torture, sale of violent video games to
children, and lies about having won military medals. See United States v.
Stevens (2010); Brown v. Entertainment Merchants v. Brown (2011); United States
v. Alvarez (2012). Who would have thought that the same Court would today

Robson

677

The First Amendment

speech? It is no great mystery what is going on here. The judges of this Court,
like the judges of the Supreme Court of Florida who promulgated Canon 7C(1),
evidently consider the preservation of public respect for the courts a policy
objective of the highest order. So it is--but so too are preventing animal torture,
protecting the innocence of children, and honoring valiant soldiers. The Court
did not relax the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech when
legislatures pursued those goals; it should not relax the guarantee when the
Supreme Court of Florida pursues this one. The First Amendment is not
abridged for the benefit of the Brotherhood of the Robe.
I respectfully dissent.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, DISSENTING.
The dissenting opinion by Justice Scalia gives a full and complete explanation
of the reasons why the Court's opinion contradicts settled First Amendment
principles. This separate dissent is written to underscore the irony in the
Court's having concluded that the very First Amendment protections judges
must enforce should be lessened when a judicial candidate's own speech is at
issue. It is written to underscore, too, the irony in the Court's having weakened
the rigors of the First Amendment in a case concerning elections, a
paradigmatic forum for speech and a process intended to protect freedom in so
many other manifestations.
First Amendment protections are both personal and structural. Free speech
begins with the right of each person to think and then to express his or her own
ideas. Protecting this personal sphere of intellect and conscience, in turn,
creates structural safeguards for many of the processes that define a free
society. The individual speech here is political speech. The process is a fair
election. These realms ought to be the last place, not the first, for the Court to
allow unprecedented content-based restrictions on speech. ***
With all due respect for the Court, it seems fair and necessary to say its
decision rests on two premises, neither one correct. One premise is that in
certain elections--here an election to choose the best qualified judge--the public
lacks the necessary judgment to make an informed choice. Instead, the State
must protect voters by altering the usual dynamics of free speech. The other
premise is that since judges should be accorded special respect and dignity,
their election can be subject to certain content-based rules that would be
unacceptable in other elections. In my respectful view neither premise can
justify the speech restriction at issue here. Although States have a compelling
interest in seeking to ensure the appearance and the reality of an impartial
judiciary, it does not follow that the State may alter basic First Amendment
principles in pursuing that goal. See Republican Party of Minn. v. White (2002).
While any number of troubling consequences will follow from the Court's ruling,
a simple example can suffice to illustrate the dead weight its decision now ties
to public debate. Assume a judge retires, and two honest lawyers, Doe and Roe,
seek the vacant position. Doe is a respected, prominent lawyer who has been
active in the community and is well known to business and civic leaders. Roe, a
lawyer of extraordinary ability and high ethical standards, keeps a low profile.

Robson

678

The First Amendment

As soon as Doe announces his or her candidacy, a campaign committee
organizes of its own accord and begins raising funds. But few know or hear
about Roe's potential candidacy, and no one with resources or connections is
available to assist in raising the funds necessary for even a modest plan to
speak to the electorate. Today the Court says the State can censor Roe's
speech, imposing a gag on his or her request for funds, no matter how close Roe
is to the potential benefactor or donor. The result is that Roe's personal
freedom, the right of speech, is cut off by the State.
The First Amendment consequences of the Court's ruling do not end with its
denial of the individual's right to speak. For the very purpose of the candidate's
fundraising was to facilitate a larger speech process: an election campaign. By
cutting off one candidate's personal freedom to speak, the broader campaign
debate that might have followed--a debate that might have been informed by
new ideas and insights from both candidates--now is silenced.
Elections are a paradigmatic forum for speech. Though present day campaign
rhetoric all too often might thwart or obscure deliberative discourse, the idea of
elections is that voters can engage in, or at least consider, a principled debate.
That debate can be a means to find consensus for a civic course that is prudent
and wise. This pertains both to issues and to the choice of elected officials. The
First Amendment seeks to make the idea of discussion, open debate, and
consensus-building a reality. But the Court decides otherwise. The Court locks
the First Amendment out.
Whether an election is the best way to choose a judge is itself the subject of fair
debate. But once the people of a State choose to have elections, the First
Amendment protects the candidate's right to speak and the public's ensuing
right to open and robust debate. One advantage of judicial elections is the
opportunity offered for the public to become more knowledgeable about their
courts and their law. This might stimulate discourse over the requisite and
highest ethical standards for the judiciary, including whether the people should
elect a judge who personally solicits campaign funds. Yet now that teaching
process is hindered by state censorship. By allowing the State's speech
restriction, the Court undermines the educational process that free speech in
elections should facilitate.
It is not within our Nation's First Amendment tradition to abridge speech simply
because the government believes a question is too difficult or too profound for
voters. If the State is concerned about unethical campaign practices, it need not
revert to the assumption that voters themselves are insensitive to ethics.
Judicial elections were created to enable citizens to decide for themselves which
judges are best qualified and which are most likely to "stand by the constitution
of the State against the encroachment of power." REPORT OF THE DEBATES AND
PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONVENTION FOR THE REVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK 672 (1846). The Court should not now presume citizens are
unequipped for that task when it comes to judging for themselves who should
judge them.
If there is concern about principled, decent, and thoughtful discourse in
election campaigns, the First Amendment provides the answer. That answer is
more speech. See, e.g., Whitney v. California (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring)

Robson

679

The First Amendment

(when the government objects to speech, "the remedy to be applied is more
speech, not enforced silence"). For example, candidates might themselves agree
to appoint members of a panel charged with periodic evaluation of campaign
statements, candor, and fairness. Those evaluations could be made public. And
any number of private organizations or voter groups seeking to evaluate
campaign rhetoric could do the same. See White (Kennedy, J. concurring).
Modern communication technologies afford voters and candidates an
unparalleled opportunity to engage in the campaign and election process. These
technologies may encourage a discourse that is principled and informed. The
Internet, in particular, has increased in a dramatic way the rapidity and
pervasiveness with which ideas may spread. Whether as a result of disclosure
laws or a candidate's voluntary decision to make the campaign transparent, the
Internet can reveal almost at once how a candidate sought funds; who the
donors were; and what amounts they gave. Indeed, disclosure requirements
offer a powerful, speech-enhancing method of deterring corruption--one that
does not impose limits on how and when people can speak. See Doe v. Reed
(2010) ("Public disclosure also promotes transparency and accountability in the
electoral process to an extent other measures cannot"). Based on disclosures
the voters can decide, among other matters, whether the public is well served
by an elected judiciary; how each candidate defines appropriate campaign
conduct (which may speak volumes about his or her judicial demeanor); and
what persons and groups support or oppose a particular candidate. See Buckley
v. Valeo (1976) (per curiam). ***
In addition to narrowing the First Amendment's reach, there is another flaw in
the Court's analysis. That is its error in the application of strict scrutiny. ***
This law comes nowhere close to being narrowly tailored. And by saying that it
survives that vital First Amendment requirement, the Court now writes what is
literally a casebook guide to eviscerating strict scrutiny any time the Court
encounters speech it dislikes. On these premises, and for the reasons explained
in more detail by Justice Scalia, it is necessary for me to file this respectful
dissent.
JUSTICE ALITO, DISSENTING.
I largely agree with what I view as the essential elements of the dissents filed by
Justices Scalia and Kennedy. The Florida rule before us regulates speech that is
part of the process of selecting those who wield the power of the State. Such
speech lies at the heart of the protection provided by the First Amendment. The
Florida rule regulates that speech based on content and must therefore satisfy
strict scrutiny. This means that it must be narrowly tailored to further a
compelling state interest. Florida has a compelling interest in making sure that
its courts decide cases impartially and in accordance with the law and that its
citizens have no good reason to lack confidence that its courts are performing
their proper role. But the Florida rule is not narrowly tailored to serve that
interest.
Indeed, this rule is about as narrowly tailored as a burlap bag. ***

1.
Williams-Yulee involves judicial elections and Chief Justice
Roberts’s opinion for the Court discusses the differences between judicial
and legislative elections. But some have argued that Williams-Yulee has
the potential to undermine allegiance to the narrow anti-corruption
rationale (quid-pro-quo) of current campaign finance doctrine.
2.
Many commentators were surprised by Chief Justice Roberts’s
position in Williams-Yulee. During oral arguments, he seemingly leaned
toward equating judicial and political elections, stating that "it's selfevident, particularly in judicial races" that "prohibiting a form of raising
funds is to the great advantage of the incumbent" because the only
way "incumbents are going to be challenged if you have somebody who
can get their own distinct message out." Later he stated that the
"fundamental choice was made by the State when they said we're going
to have judges elected,” echoing Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in
Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, (2002). Note that since her
retirement from the Court, Sandra Day O’Connor has been vocal in her
criticism of judicial elections.
3.
Note the references in Williams-Yulee to Caperton v. A. T. Massey
Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868 (2009). In Caperton, the Court held that the
“extreme facts” of the case - - - an outsized campaign contribution to a
West Virginia state supreme court judge by a party subsequently
appearing before the court - - - created the probability of bias meriting
recusal as a matter of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.
The decision was closely divided; but interestingly Justice Kennedy
writing for the Court, and Chief Justice Roberts authoring the primary
dissent. The outcomes of these cases seem to point to the Court’s
willingness to uphold judicial integrity, but the positions of some
Justices seem internally inconsistent.

316 U.S. 52 (1942)

JUSTICE ROBERTS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE [UNANIMOUS] COURT.
The respondent, a citizen of Florida, owns a former United States Navy
submarine which he exhibits for profit. In 1940 he brought it to New York City
and moored it at a State pier in the East River. He prepared and printed a
handbill advertising the boat and soliciting visitors for a stated admission fee.
On his attempting to distribute the bill in the city streets, he was advised by the
petitioner, as Police Commissioner, that this activity would violate § 318 of the
Sanitary Code, which forbids distribution in the streets of commercial and
business advertising matter but was told that he might freely distribute
handbills solely devoted to "information or a public protest."
Respondent thereupon prepared and showed to the petitioner, in proof form, a
double-faced handbill. On one side was a revision of the original, altered by the
removal of the statement as to admission fee but consisting only of commercial
advertising. On the other side was a protest against the action of the City Dock
Department in refusing the respondent wharfage facilities at a city pier for the
exhibition of his submarine, but no commercial advertising. The Police
Department advised that distribution of a bill containing only the protest would
not violate § 318, and would not be restrained, but that distribution of the
double-faced bill was prohibited. The respondent, nevertheless, proceeded with
the printing of his proposed bill and started to distribute it. He was restrained
by the police.
Respondent then brought this suit to enjoin the petitioner from interfering with
the distribution. In his complaint he alleged diversity of citizenship; an amount
in controversy in excess of $3,000; the acts and threats of the petitioner under
the purported authority of § 318; asserted a consequent violation of § 1 of the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution; and prayed an injunction. The
District Court granted an interlocutory injunction, and after trial on a
stipulation from which the facts appear as above recited, granted a permanent
injunction. The Circuit Court of Appeals, by a divided court, affirmed.
The question is whether the application of the ordinance to the respondent's
activity was, in the circumstances, an unconstitutional abridgement of the
freedom of the press and of speech.
1. This court has unequivocally held that the streets are proper places for the
exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating
opinion and that, though the states and municipalities may appropriately
regulate the privilege in the public interest, they may not unduly burden or
proscribe its employment in these public thoroughfares. We are equally clear
that the Constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects
purely commercial advertising. Whether, and to what extent, one may promote
or pursue a gainful occupation in the streets, to what extent such activity shall

Robson

683

The First Amendment

be adjudged a derogation of the public right of user, are matters for legislative
judgment. The question is not whether the legislative body may interfere with
the harmless pursuit of a lawful business, but whether it must permit such
pursuit by what it deems an undesirable invasion of, or interference with, the
full and free use of the highways by the people in fulfillment of the public use to
which streets are dedicated. If the respondent was attempting to use the streets
of New York by distributing commercial advertising, the prohibition of the code
provision was lawfully invoked against his conduct.
2. The respondent contends that, in truth, he was engaged in the dissemination
of matter proper for public information, none the less so because there was
inextricably attached to the medium of such dissemination commercial
advertising matter. The court below appears to have taken this view, since it
adverts to the the difficulty of apportioning, in a given case, the contents of the
communication as between what is of public interest and what is for private
profit. We need not indulge nice appraisal based upon subtle distinctions in the
present instance nor assume possible cases not now presented. It is enough for
the present purpose that the stipulated facts justify the conclusion that the
affixing of the protest against official conduct to the advertising circular was
with the intent, and for the purpose, of evading the prohibition of the ordinance.
If that evasion were successful, every merchant who desires to broadcast
advertising leaflets in the streets need only append a civic appeal, or a moral
platitude, to achieve immunity from the law's command.
The decree is
Reversed.

Bigelow	  v.	  Commonwealth	  of	  Virginia	  
421 U.S. 809 (1975)

BLACKMUN, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH BURGER, C. J., AND DOUGLAS,
BRENNAN, STEWART, MARSHALL, AND POWELL, JJ., JOINED. REHNQUIST, J., FILED A DISSENTING
OPINION, IN WHICH WHITE, J., JOINED.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
An advertisement carried in appellant's newspaper led to his conviction for a
violation of a Virginia statute that made it a misdemeanor, by the sale or
circulation of any publication, to encourage or prompt the procuring of an
abortion. The issue here is whether the editor-appellant's First Amendment
rights were unconstitutionally abridged by the statute. The First Amendment, of
course, is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.
Schneider v. State (1939).
I
The Virginia Weekly was a newspaper published by the Virginia Weekly
Associates of Charlottesville. It was issued in that city and circulated in
Albemarle County, with particular focus on the campus of the University of
Virginia. Appellant, Jeffrey C. Bigelow, was a director and the managing editor
and responsible officer of the newspaper.

Robson

684

The First Amendment

On February 8, 1971, the Weekly's Vol. V, No. 6, was published and circulated
under the direct responsibility of the appellant. On page 2 of that issue was the
following advertisement:
"UNWANTED PREGNANCY
LET US HELP YOU
Abortions are now legal in New York.
There are no residency requirements.
FOR IMMEDIATE PLACEMENT IN ACCREDITED
HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AT LOW COST
Contact WOMEN'S PAVILION
515 Madison Avenue
New York, N. Y. 10022
or call any time (212) 371-6670 or (212) 371-6650
AVAILABLE 7 DAYS A WEEK
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL. We will make
all arrangements for you and help you
with information and counseling."

It is to be observed that the advertisement announced that the Women's
Pavilion of New York City would help women with unwanted pregnancies to
obtain "immediate placement in accredited hospitals and clinics at low cost"
and would "make all arrangements" on a "strictly confidential" basis; that it
offered "information and counseling"; that it gave the organization's address and
telephone numbers; and that it stated that abortions "are now legal in New
York" and there "are no residency requirements." Although the advertisement
did not contain the name of any licensed physician, the "placement" to which it
referred was to "accredited hospitals and clinics."
On May 13 Bigelow was charged with violating Va. Code Ann. § 18.1-63 (1960).
The statute at that time read:
"If any person, by publication, lecture, advertisement, or by the sale or
circulation of any publication, or in any other manner, encourage or prompt the
procuring of abortion or miscarriage, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."

Shortly after the statute was utilized in Bigelow's case, and apparently before it
was ever used again, the Virginia Legislature amended it and changed its prior
application and scope.
Appellant was first tried and convicted in the County Court of Albemarle
County. He appealed to the Circuit Court of that county where he was entitled
to a de novo trial. In the Circuit Court he waived a jury and in July 1971 was
tried to the judge. The evidence consisted of stipulated facts; an excerpt,
containing the advertisement in question, from the Weekly's issue of February 8,
1971; and the June 1971 issue of Redbook magazine, containing abortion
information and distributed in Virginia and in Albemarle County. The court
rejected appellant's claim that the statute was unconstitutional and adjudged
him guilty. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $500, with $350 thereof
suspended "conditioned upon no further violation" of the statute.
The Supreme Court of Virginia granted review and, by a 4-2 vote, affirmed
Bigelow's conviction. The court first rejected the appellant's claim that the
advertisement was purely informational and thus was not within the
"encourage or prompt" language of the statute. It held, instead, that the

Robson

685

The First Amendment

advertisement "clearly exceeded an informational status" and "constituted an
active offer to perform a service, rather than a passive statement of fact." It then
rejected Bigelow's First Amendment claim. This, the court said, was a
"commercial advertisement" and, as such, "may be constitutionally prohibited
by the state," particularly "where, as here, the advertising relates to the
medical-health field." The issue, in the court's view, was whether the statute
was a valid exercise of the State's police power. It answered this question in the
affirmative, noting that the statute's goal was "to ensure that pregnant women
in Virginia who decided to have abortions come to their decisions without the
commercial advertising pressure usually incidental to the sale of a box of soap
powder." The court then turned to Bigelow's claim of overbreadth. It held that
because the appellant himself lacked a legitimate First Amendment interest,
inasmuch as his activity "was of a purely commercial nature," he had no
"standing to rely upon the hypothetical rights of those in the non-commercial
zone."
Bigelow took a timely appeal to this Court. During the pendency of his appeal,
Roe v.Wade (1973) and Doe v. Bolton (1973) were decided. We subsequently
vacated Bigelow's judgment of conviction and remanded the case for further
consideration in the light of Roe and Doe.
The Supreme Court of Virginia, on such reconsideration, but without further
oral argument, again affirmed appellant's conviction, observing that neither Roe
nor Doe "mentioned the subject of abortion advertising" and finding nothing in
those decisions "which in any way affects our earlier view. Once again, Bigelow
appealed. We noted probable jurisdiction in order to review the important First
Amendment issue presented.
II
This Court often has recognized that a defendant's standing to challenge a
statute on First Amendment grounds as facially overbroad does not depend
upon whether his own activity is shown to be constitutionally privileged. The
Court consistently has permitted "attacks on overly broad statutes with no
requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own
conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow
specificity." ***
This "exception to the usual rules governing standing," reflects the
transcendent value to all society of constitutionally protected expression. We
give a defendant standing to challenge a statute on grounds that it is facially
overbroad, regardless of whether his own conduct could be regulated by a more
narrowly drawn statute, because of the "danger of tolerating, in the area of First
Amendment freedoms, the existence of a penal statute susceptible of sweeping
and improper application.
*** Declaring a statute facially unconstitutional because of overbreadth "is,
manifestly, strong medicine," and "has been employed by the Court sparingly
and only as a last resort."Broadrick v. Oklahoma (1973). *** In view of the
statute's amendment since Bigelow's conviction in such a way as "effectively to
repeal" its prior application, there is no possibility now that the statute's pre1972 form will be applied again to appellant or will chill the rights of others. As
a practical matter, the issue of its overbreadth has become moot for the future.

The First Amendment

We therefore decline to rest our decision on overbreadth and we pass on to the
further inquiry, of greater moment not only for Bigelow but for others, whether
the statute as applied to appellant infringed constitutionally protected speech.
III
A.
The central assumption made by the Supreme Court of Virginia was that the
First Amendment guarantees of speech and press are inapplicable to paid
commercial advertisements. Our cases, however, clearly establish that speech is
not stripped of First Amendment protection merely because it appears in that
form. Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Rel. Comm'n (1973); New York Times Co. v.
Sullivan (1964).
The fact that the particular advertisement in appellant's newspaper had
commercial aspects or reflected the advertiser's commercial interests did not
negate all First Amendment guarantees. The State was not free of constitutional
restraint merely because the advertisement involved sales or "solicitations," or
because appellant was paid for printing it, or because appellant's motive or the
motive of the advertiser may have involved financial gain. The existence of
"commercial activity, in itself, is no justification for narrowing the protection of
expression secured by the First Amendment."
Although other categories of speech—such as fighting words, Chaplinsky v. New
Hampshire (1942), or obscenity, Roth v. United States (1957), Miller v.
California (1973), or libel, Gertz v.Robert Welch, Inc. (1974), or incitement,
Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969)—have been held unprotected, no contention has
been made that the particular speech embraced in the advertisement in
question is within any of these categories.
The appellee, as did the Supreme Court of Virginia, relies on Valentine v.
Chrestensen (1942), where a unanimous Court, in a brief opinion, sustained an
ordinance which had been interpreted to ban the distribution of a handbill
advertising the exhibition of a submarine. The handbill solicited customers to
tour the ship for a fee. The promoter-advertiser had first attempted to distribute
a single-faced handbill consisting only of the advertisement, and was denied
permission to do so. He then had printed, on the reverse side of the handbill, a
protest against official conduct refusing him the use of wharfage facilities. The
Court found that the message of asserted "public interest" was appended solely
for the purpose of evading the ordinance and therefore did not constitute an
"exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating
opinion." It said:
"We are equally clear that the Constitution imposes no such restraint on
government as respects purely commercial advertising."
But the holding is distinctly a limited one: the ordinance was upheld as a
reasonable regulation of the manner in which commercial advertising could be
distributed. The fact that it had the effect of banning a particular handbill does
not mean that Chrestensen is authority for the proposition that all statutes
regulating commercial advertising are immune from constitutional challenge.
The case obviously does not support any sweeping proposition that advertising
is unprotected per se.

Robson

687

The First Amendment

This Court's cases decided since
Chrestensen
clearly demonstrate as
untenable any reading of that case that would give it so broad an effect. In New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan, a city official instituted a civil libel action against
four clergymen and the New York Times. The suit was based on an
advertisement carried in the newspaper criticizing police action against
members of the civil rights movement and soliciting contributions for the
movement. The Court held that this advertisement, although containing
factually erroneous defamatory content, was entitled to the same degree of
constitutional protection as ordinary speech. It said:
"That the Times was paid for publishing the advertisement is as
immaterial in this connection as is the fact that newspapers and books
are sold."
Chrestensen was distinguished on the ground that the handbill advertisement
there did no more than propose a purely commercial transaction, whereas the
one in New York Times
"communicated information, expressed opinion, recited grievances, protested
claimed abuses, and sought financial support on behalf of a movement whose
existence and objectives are matters of the highest public interest and concern."

The principle that commercial advertising enjoys a degree of First Amendment
protection was reaffirmed in Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Rel. Comm'n (1973).
There, the Court, although divided, sustained an ordinance that had been
construed to forbid newspapers to carry help-wanted advertisements in sexdesignated columns except where based upon a bona fide occupational
exemption. The Court did describe the advertisements at issue as "classic
examples of commercial speech," for each was "no more than a proposal of
possible employment." But the Court indicated that the advertisements would
have received some degree of First Amendment protection if the commercial
proposal had been legal. The illegality of the advertised activity was particularly
stressed:
"Any First Amendment interest which might be served by advertising an
ordinary commercial proposal and which might arguably outweigh the
governmental interest supporting the regulation is altogether absent when the
commercial activity itself is illegal and the restriction on advertising is incidental
to a valid limitation on economic activity."

B.
The legitimacy of appellant's First Amendment claim in the present case is
demonstrated by the important differences between the advertisement presently
at issue and those involved in Chrestensen and in Pittsburgh Press. The
advertisement published in appellant's newspaper did more than simply
propose a commercial transaction. It contained factual material of clear "public
interest." Portions of its message, most prominently the lines, "Abortions are
now legal in New York. There are no residency requirements," involve the
exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating
opinion.
Viewed in its entirety, the advertisement conveyed information of potential
interest and value to a diverse audience—not only to readers possibly in need of

Robson

688

The First Amendment

the services offered, but also to those with a general curiosity about, or genuine
interest in, the subject matter or the law of another State and its development,
and to readers seeking reform in Virginia. The mere existence of the Women's
Pavilion in New York City, with the possibility of its being typical of other
organizations there, and the availability of the services offered, were not
unnewsworthy. Also, the activity advertised pertained to constitutional interests.
See Roe v. Wade (1973) and Doe v. Bolton (1973). Thus, in this case,
appellant's First Amendment interests coincided with the constitutional
interests of the general public.
Moreover, the placement services advertised in appellant's newspaper were
legally provided in New York at that time. The Virginia Legislature could not
have regulated the advertiser's activity in New York, and obviously could not
have proscribed the activity in that State. Neither could Virginia prevent its
residents from traveling to New York to obtain those services or, as the State
conceded, prosecute them for going there. Virginia possessed no authority to
regulate the services provided in New York—the skills and credentials of the
New York physicians and of the New York professionals who assisted them, the
standards of the New York hospitals and clinics to which patients were referred,
or the practices and charges of the New York referral services.
A State does not acquire power or supervision over the internal affairs of
another State merely because the welfare and health of its own citizens may be
affected when they travel to that State. It may seek to disseminate information
so as to enable its citizens to make better informed decisions when they leave.
But it may not, under the guise of exercising internal police powers, bar a
citizen of another State from disseminating information about an activity that is
legal in that State.
C.
We conclude, therefore, that the Virginia courts erred in their assumptions that
advertising, as such, was entitled to no First Amendment protection and that
appellant Bigelow had no legitimate First Amendment interest. We need not
decide in this case the precise extent to which the First Amendment permits
regulation of advertising that is related to activities the State may legitimately
regulate or even prohibit.
Advertising, like all public expression, may be subject to reasonable regulation
that serves a legitimate public interest. To the extent that commercial activity is
subject to regulation, the relationship of speech to that activity may be one
factor, among others, to be considered in weighing the First Amendment
interest against the governmental interest alleged. Advertising is not thereby
stripped of all First Amendment protection. The relationship of speech to the
marketplace of products or of services does not make it valueless in the
marketplace of ideas.
The Court has stated that "a State cannot foreclose the exercise of
constitutional rights by mere labels." NAACP v. Button. Regardless of the
particular label asserted by the State—whether it calls speech "commercial" or
"commercial advertising" or "solicitation" —a court may not escape the task of
assessing the First Amendment interest at stake and weighing it against the
public interest allegedly served by the regulation. The diverse motives, means,

Robson

689

The First Amendment

and messages of advertising may make speech "commercial" in widely varying
degrees. We need not decide here the extent to which constitutional protection
is afforded commercial advertising under all circumstances and in the face of all
kinds of regulation.
IV
The task of balancing the interests at stake here was one that should have been
undertaken by the Virginia courts before they reached their decision. We need
not
remand for that purpose, however, because the outcome is readily
apparent from what has been said above.
***Here, Virginia is really asserting an interest in regulating what Virginians
may hear or read about the New York services. It is, in effect, advancing an
interest in shielding its citizens from information about activities outside
Virginia's borders, activities that Virginia's police powers do not reach. This
asserted interest, even if understandable, was entitled to little, if any, weight
under the circumstances.
No claim has been made, nor could any be supported on this record, that the
advertisement was deceptive or fraudulent, or that it related to a commodity or
service that was then illegal in either Virginia or in New York, or that it
otherwise furthered a criminal scheme in Virginia. There was no possibility that
appellant's activity would invade the privacy of other citizens, or infringe on
other rights. Observers would not have the advertiser's message thrust upon
them as a captive audience.
The strength of appellant's interest was augmented by the fact that the statute
was applied against him as publisher and editor of a newspaper, not against the
advertiser or a referral agency or a practitioner. The prosecution thus incurred
more serious First Amendment overtones.
If application of this statute were upheld under these circumstances, Virginia
might exert the power sought here over a wide variety of national publications
or interstate newspapers carrying advertisements similar to the one that
appeared in Bigelow's newspaper or containing articles on the general subject
matter to which the advertisement referred. Other States might do the same.
The burdens thereby imposed on publications would impair, perhaps severely,
their proper functioning. The policy of the First Amendment favors
dissemination of information and opinion, and "[t]he guarantees of freedom of
speech and press were not designed to prevent `the censorship of the press
merely, but any action of the government by means of which it might prevent
such free and general discussion of public matters as seems absolutely
essential . . . .' 2 COOLEY, CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS 886 (8th ed.)."
We conclude that Virginia could not apply Va. Code Ann. § 18.1-63 (1960), as it
read in 1971, to appellant's publication of the advertisement in question
without unconstitutionally infringing upon his First Amendment rights. The
judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia is therefore reversed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, WITH WHOM JUSTICE WHITE JOINS, DISSENTING.
The Court's opinion does not confront head-on the question which this case
poses, but makes contact with it only in a series of verbal sideswipes. The
Robson

690

The First Amendment

result is the fashioning of a doctrine which appears designed to obtain reversal
of this judgment, but at the same time to save harmless from the effects of that
doctrine the many prior cases of this Court which are inconsistent with it.
I am in agreement with the Court that Virginia's statute cannot properly be
invalidated on grounds of overbreadth, given that the sole prosecution which
has ever been brought under this now substantially altered statute is that now
in issue. ***
Since the Court concludes, apparently from two lines of the advertisement, that
it conveyed information of value to those interested in the "subject matter or the
law of another State and its development" and to those "seeking reform in
Virginia," and since the ad relates to abortion, elevated to constitutional stature
by the Court, it concludes that this advertisement is entitled to something more
than the limited constitutional protection traditionally accorded commercial
advertising. Although recognizing that "[a]dvertising, like all public expression,
may be subject to reasonable regulation that serves a legitimate public
interest," the Court for reasons not entirely clear to me concludes that Virginia's
interest is of "little, if any, weight."
If the Court's decision does, indeed, turn upon its conclusion that the
advertisement here in question was protected by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, the subject of the advertisement ought to make no difference. It
will not do to say, as the Court does, that this advertisement conveyed
information about the "subject matter or the law of another State and its
development" to those "seeking reform in Virginia," and that it related to
abortion, as if these factors somehow put it on a different footing from other
commercial advertising. This was a proposal to furnish services on a
commercial basis, and since we have always refused to distinguish for First
Amendment purposes on the basis of content, it is no different from an
advertisement for a bucket shop operation or a Ponzi scheme which has its
headquarters in New York. If Virginia may not regulate advertising of
commercial abortion agencies because of the interest of those seeking to reform
Virginia's abortion laws, it is difficult to see why it is not likewise precluded
from regulating advertising for an out-of-state bucket shop on the ground that
such information might be of interest to those interested in repealing Virginia's
"blue sky" laws.
As a threshold matter the advertisement appears to me, as it did to the courts
below, to be a classic commercial proposition directed toward the exchange of
services rather than the exchange of ideas. It was apparently also so interpreted
by the newspaper which published it which stated in apparent apology in its
following issue that the “ ‘Weekly collective has since learned that this abortion
agency . . . as well as a number of other commercial groups are charging
women a fee for a service which is done free by Women's Liberation, Planned
Parenthood, and others.’” Whatever slight factual content the advertisement
may contain and whatever expression of opinion may be laboriously drawn
from it does not alter its predominantly commercial content. "If that evasion
were successful, every merchant who desires to broadcast . . . need only append
a civic appeal, or a moral platitude, to achieve immunity from the law's
command." Valentine v. Chrestensen (1942). I am unable to perceive any
relationship between the instant advertisement and that for example in issue in

Robson

691

The First Amendment

New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). Nor am I able to distinguish this
commercial proposition from that held to be purely commercial in Pittsburgh
Press Co. v. Human Rel. Comm'n (1973). As the Court recognizes, a purely
commercial proposal is entitled to little constitutional protection.
Assuming arguendo that this advertisement is something more than a normal
commercial proposal, I am unable to see why Virginia does not have a legitimate
public interest in its regulation. The Court apparently concedes, and our cases
have long held, that the States have a strong interest in the prevention of
commercial advertising in the health field—both in order to maintain high
ethical standards in the medical profession and to protect the public from
unscrupulous practices. And the interest asserted by the Supreme Court of
Virginia in the Virginia statute was the prevention of commercial exploitation of
those women who elect to have an abortion:
"It is clearly within the police power of the state to enact reasonable measures
to ensure that pregnant women in Virginia who decide to have abortions come
to their decisions without the commercial advertising pressure usually
incidental to the sale of a box of soap powder. And the state is rightfully
interested in seeing that Virginia women who do decide to have abortions obtain
proper medical care and do not fall into the hands of those interested only in
financial gain, and not in the welfare of the patient."
*** Were the Court's statements taken literally, they would presage a standard
of the lowest common denominator for commercial ethics and business conduct.
Securities issuers could circumvent the established blue sky laws of States
which had carefully drawn such laws for the protection of their citizens by
establishing as a situs for transactions those States without such regulations,
while spreading offers throughout the country. Loan sharks might well choose
States with unregulated small loan industries, luring the unwary with immune
commercial advertisements. And imagination would place the only limit on the
use of such a "no-man's land" together with artificially created territorial
contacts to bilk the public and circumvent long-established state schemes of
regulation.
Since the Court saves harmless from its present opinion our prior cases in this
area, it may be fairly inferred that it does not intend the results which might
otherwise come from a literal reading of its opinion. But solely on the facts
before it, I think the Court today simply errs in assessing Virginia's interest in
its statute because it does not focus on the impact of the practices in question
on the State. Although the commercial referral agency, whose advertisement in
Virginia was barred, was physically located outside the State, this physical
contact says little about Virginia's concern for the touted practices. Virginia's
interest in this statute lies in preventing commercial exploitation of the health
needs of its citizens. So long as the statute bans commercial advertising by
publications within the State, the extraterritorial location at which the services
are actually provided does not diminish that interest.

CONCURRING OPINIONS. REHNQUIST, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION. STEVENS, J., TOOK NO PART
IN THE CONSIDERATION OR DECISION OF THE CASE.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The plaintiff-appellees in this case attack, as violative of the First and
Fourteenth Amendments, that portion of § 54-524.35 of Va. Code Ann. (1974),
which provides that a pharmacist licensed in Virginia is guilty of unprofessional
conduct if he "(3) publishes, advertises or promotes, directly or indirectly, in
any manner whatsoever, any amount, price, fee, premium, discount, rebate or
credit terms . . . for any drugs which may be dispensed only by prescription."
The three-judge District Court declared the quoted portion of the statute "void
and of no effect," and enjoined the defendant-appellants, the Virginia State
Board of Pharmacy and the individual members of that Board, from enforcing it.
We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal.
I
Since the challenged restraint is one that peculiarly concerns the licensed
pharmacist in Virginia, we begin with a description of that profession as it
exists under Virginia law.
The "practice of pharmacy" is statutorily declared to be "a professional practice
affecting the public health, safety and welfare," and to be "subject to regulation
and control in the public interest." Indeed, the practice is subject to extensive
regulation aimed at preserving high professional standards. The regulatory body
is the appellant Virginia State Board of Pharmacy. The Board is broadly charged
by statute with various responsibilities, including the "[m]aintenance of the
quality, quantity, integrity, safety and efficacy of drugs or devices distributed,
dispensed or administered." It also is to concern itself with "[m]aintaining the
integrity of, and public confidence in, the profession and improving the delivery
of quality pharmaceutical services to the citizens of Virginia." The Board is
empowered to "make such bylaws, rules and regulations. . . as may be
necessary for the lawful exercise of its powers."
The Board is also the licensing authority. It may issue a license, necessary for
the practice of pharmacy in the State, only upon evidence that the applicant is
"of good moral character," is a graduate in pharmacy of a school approved by
the Board, and has had "a suitable period of experience [the period required not
to exceed 12 months] acceptable to the Board." The applicant must pass the
examination prescribed by the Board. One approved school is the School of
Pharmacy of the Medical College of Virginia, where the curriculum is for three
years following two years of college. Prescribed prepharmacy courses, such as
biology and chemistry, are to be taken in college, and study requirements at the
school itself include courses in organic chemistry, biochemistry, comparative
anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology. Students are also trained in the ethics

Robson

693

The First Amendment

of the profession, and there is some clinical experience in the school's hospital
pharmacies and in the medical center operated by the Medical College. This is
"a rigid, demanding curriculum in terms of what the pharmacy student is
expected to know about drugs."
Once licensed, a pharmacist is subject to a civil monetary penalty, or to
revocation or suspension of his license, if the Board finds that he "is not of good
moral character," or has violated any of a number of stated professional
standards (among them that he not be "negligent in the practice of pharmacy"
or have engaged in "fraud or deceit upon the consumer . . . in connection with
the practice of pharmacy"), or is guilty of "unprofessional conduct."
"Unprofessional conduct" is specifically defined in § 54-524.35, n. 2, the third
numbered phrase of which relates to advertising of the price for any
prescription drug, and is the subject of this litigation.
Inasmuch as only a licensed pharmacist may dispense prescription drugs in
Virginia, § 54-524.48, advertising or other affirmative dissemination of
prescription drug price information is effectively forbidden in the State. Some
pharmacies refuse even to quote prescription drug prices over the telephone.
The Board's position, however, is that this would not constitute an
unprofessional publication. It is clear, nonetheless, that all advertising of such
prices, in the normal sense, is forbidden. The prohibition does not extend to
nonprescription drugs, but neither is it confined to prescriptions that the
pharmacist compounds himself. Indeed, about 95% of all prescriptions now are
filled with dosage forms prepared by the pharmaceutical manufacturer.
II
This is not the first challenge to the constitutionality of § 54-524.35 and what is
now its third-numbered phrase. Shortly after the phrase was added to the
statute in 1968, a suit seeking to enjoin its operation was instituted by a drug
retailing company and one of its pharmacists. Although the First Amendment
was invoked, the challenge appears to have been based primarily on the Due
Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. In any
event, the prohibition on drug price advertising was upheld. ***
The present, and second, attack on the statute is one made not by one directly
subject to its prohibition, that is, a pharmacist, but by prescription drug
consumers who claim that they would greatly benefit if the prohibition were
lifted and advertising freely allowed. The plaintiffs are an individual Virginia
resident who suffers from diseases that require her to take prescription drugs
on a daily basis, and two nonprofit organizations. Their claim is that the First
Amendment entitles the user of prescription drugs to receive information that
pharmacists wish to communicate to them through advertising and other
promotional means, concerning the prices of such drugs.
Certainly that information may be of value. Drug prices in Virginia, for both
prescription and nonprescription items, strikingly vary from outlet to outlet
even within the same locality. It is stipulated, for example, that in Richmond
"the cost of 40 Achromycin tablets ranges from $2.59 to $6.00, a difference of
140% [sic]," and that in the Newport News-Hampton area the cost of
tetracycline ranges from $1.20 to $9.00, a difference of 650%.
***

Robson

694

The First Amendment

III
The question first arises whether, even assuming that First Amendment
protection attaches to the flow of drug price information, it is a protection
enjoyed by the appellees as recipients of the information, and not solely, if at all,
by the advertisers themselves who seek to disseminate that information.
Freedom of speech presupposes a willing speaker. But where a speaker exists,
as is the case here, the protection afforded is to the communication, to its
source and to its recipients both. This is clear from the decided cases. *** If
there is a right to advertise, there is a reciprocal right to receive the advertising,
and it may be asserted by these appellees.
IV
The appellants contend that the advertisement of prescription drug prices is
outside the protection of the First Amendment because it is "commercial
speech." There can be no question that in past decisions the Court has given
some indication that commercial speech is unprotected. In Valentine v.
Chrestensen the Court upheld a New York statute that prohibited the
distribution of any "handbill, circular . . . or other advertising matter
whatsoever in or upon any street." The Court concluded that, although the First
Amendment would forbid the banning of all communication by handbill in the
public thoroughfares, it imposed "no such restraint on government as respect
purely commercial advertising." ***
Last Term, in Bigelow v. Virginia, the notion of unprotected "commercial speech"
all but passed from the scene. We reversed a conviction for violation of a
Virginia statute that made the circulation of any publication to encourage or
promote the processing of an abortion in Virginia a misdemeanor. The
defendant had published in his newspaper the availability of abortions in New
York. The advertisement in question, in addition to announcing that abortions
were legal in New York, offered the services of a referral agency in that State. We
rejected the contention that the publication was unprotected because it was
commercial. Chrestensen's continued validity was questioned, and its holding
was described as "distinctly a limited one" that merely upheld "a reasonable
regulation of the manner in which commercial advertising could be distributed."
We concluded that "the Virginia courts erred in their assumptions that
advertising, as such, was entitled to no First Amendment protection," and we
observed that the "relationship of speech to the marketplace of products or of
services does not make it valueless in the marketplace of ideas."
Some fragment of hope for the continuing validity of a "commercial speech"
exception arguably might have persisted because of the subject matter of the
advertisement in Bigelow. We noted that in announcing the availability of legal
abortions in New York, the advertisement "did more than simply propose a
commercial transaction. It contained factual material of clear `public interest.' "
And, of course, the advertisement related to activity with which, at least in
some respects, the State could not interfere. See Roe v. Wade (1973); Doe v.
Bolton (1973). Indeed, we observed: "We need not decide in this case the precise
extent to which the First Amendment permits regulation of advertising that is
related to activities the State may legitimately regulate or even prohibit."

Robson

695

The First Amendment

Here, in contrast, the question whether there is a First Amendment exception
for "commercial speech" is squarely before us. Our pharmacist does not wish to
editorialize on any subject, cultural, philosophical, or political. He does not
wish to report any particularly newsworthy fact, or to make generalized
observations even about commercial matters. The "idea" he wishes to
communicate is simply this: "I will sell you the X prescription drug at the Y
price." Our question, then, is whether this communication is wholly outside the
protection of the First Amendment.
V
We begin with several propositions that already are settled or beyond serious
dispute. It is clear, for example, that speech does not lose its First Amendment
protection because money is spent to project it, as in a paid advertisement of
one form or another. Buckley v. Valeo (1976); Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human
Relations Comm'n; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. Speech likewise is protected
even though it is carried in a form that is "sold" for profit, Smith v. California
(1959) (books); Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson (1952) (motion pictures); Murdock
v. Pennsylvania (religious literature), and even though it may involve a
solicitation to purchase or otherwise pay or contribute money, New York Times
Co. v. Sullivan; NAACP v. Button.
If there is a kind of commercial speech that lacks all First Amendment
protection, therefore, it must be distinguished by its content. Yet the speech
whose content deprives it of protection cannot simply be speech on a
commercial subject. No one would contend that our pharmacist may be
prevented from being heard on the subject of whether, in general,
pharmaceutical prices should be regulated, or their advertisement forbidden.
Nor can it be dispositive that a commercial advertisement is noneditorial, and
merely reports a fact. Purely factual matter of public interest may claim
protection.
Our question is whether speech which does "no more than propose a
commercial transaction," is so removed from any "exposition of ideas,"
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942), and from " `truth, science, morality, and
arts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on the administration of
Government,' " Roth v. United States (1957), that it lacks all protection. Our
answer is that it is not.
Focusing first on the individual parties to the transaction that is proposed in
the commercial advertisement, we may assume that the advertiser's interest is
a purely economic one. That hardly disqualifies him from protection under the
First Amendment. The interests of the Contestants in a labor dispute are
primarily economic, but it has long been settled that both the employee and the
employer are protected by the First Amendment when they express themselves
on the merits of the dispute in order to influence its outcome. ***
As to the particular consumer's interest in the free flow of commercial
information, that interest may be as keen, if not keener by far, than his interest
in the day's most urgent political debate. Appellees' case in this respect is a
convincing one. Those whom the suppression of prescription drug price
information hits the hardest are the poor, the sick, and particularly the aged. A
disproportionate amount of their income tends to be spent on prescription

Robson

696

The First Amendment

drugs; yet they are the least able to learn, by shopping from pharmacist to
pharmacist, where their scarce dollars are best spent. When drug prices vary as
strikingly as they do, information as to who is charging what becomes more
than a convenience. It could mean the alleviation of physical pain or the
enjoyment of basic necessities.
Generalizing, society also may have a strong interest in the free flow of
commercial information. Even an individual advertisement, though entirely
"commercial," may be of general public interest. *** Obviously, not all
commercial messages contain the same or even a very great public interest
element. There are few to which such an element, however, could not be added.
Our pharmacist, for example, could cast himself as a commentator on store-tostore disparities in drug prices, giving his own and those of a competitor as
proof. We see little point in requiring him to do so, and little difference if he
does not.
Moreover, there is another consideration that suggests that no line between
publicly "interesting" or "important" commercial advertising and the opposite
kind could ever be drawn. Advertising, however tasteless and excessive it
sometimes may seem, is nonetheless dissemination of information as to who is
producing and selling what product, for what reason, and at what price. So long
as we preserve a predominantly free enterprise economy, the allocation of our
resources in large measure will be made through numerous private economic
decisions. It is a matter of public interest that those decisions, in the aggregate,
be intelligent and well informed. To this end, the free flow of commercial
information is indispensable. And if it is indispensable to the proper allocation
of resources in a free enterprise system, it is also indispensable to the formation
of intelligent opinions as to how that system ought to be regulated or altered.
Therefore, even if the First Amendment were thought to be primarily an
instrument to enlighten public decisionmaking in a democracy, we could not
say that the free flow of information does not serve that goal.
Arrayed against these substantial individual and societal interests are a
number of justifications for the advertising ban. These have to do principally
with maintaining a high degree of professionalism on the part of licensed
pharmacists. Indisputably, the State has a strong interest in maintaining that
professionalism. It is exercised in a number of ways for the consumer's benefit.
There is the clinical skill involved in the compounding of drugs, although, as
has been noted, these now make up only a small percentage of the
prescriptions filled. Yet, even with respect to manufacturer-prepared
compounds, there is room for the pharmacist to serve his customer well or
badly. Drugs kept too long on the shelf may lose their efficacy or become
adulterated. They can be packaged for the user in such a way that the same
results occur. The expertise of the pharmacist may supplement that of the
prescribing physician, if the latter has not specified the amount to be dispensed
or the directions that are to appear on the label. The pharmacist, a specialist in
the potencies and dangers of drugs, may even be consulted by the physician as
to what to prescribe. He may know of a particular antagonism between the
prescribed drug and another that the customer is or might be taking, or with an
allergy the customer may suffer. The pharmacist himself may have supplied the
other drug or treated the allergy. Some pharmacists, concededly not a large

Robson

697

The First Amendment

number, "monitor" the health problems and drug consumptions of customers
who come to them repeatedly. A pharmacist who has a continuous relationship
with his customer is in the best position, of course, to exert professional skill
for the customer's protection.
Price advertising, it is argued, will place in jeopardy the pharmacist's expertise
and, with it, the customer's health. It is claimed that the aggressive price
competition that will result from unlimited advertising will make it impossible
for the pharmacist to supply professional services in the compounding,
handling, and dispensing of prescription drugs. Such services are time
consuming and expensive; if competitors who economize by eliminating them
are permitted to advertise their resulting lower prices, the more painstaking and
conscientious pharmacist will be forced either to follow suit or to go out of
business. It is also claimed that prices might not necessarily fall as a result of
advertising. If one pharmacist advertises, others must, and the resulting
expense will inflate the cost of drugs. It is further claimed that advertising will
lead people to shop for their prescription drugs among the various pharmacists
who offer the lowest prices, and the loss of stable pharmacist-customer
relationships will make individual attention—and certainly the practice of
monitoring—impossible. Finally, it is argued that damage will be done to the
professional image of the pharmacist. This image, that of a skilled and
specialized craftsman, attracts talent to the profession and reinforces the better
habits of those who are in it. Price advertising, it is said, will reduce the
pharmacist's status to that of a mere retailer.
The strength of these proffered justifications is greatly undermined by the fact
that high professional standards, to a substantial extent, are guaranteed by the
close regulation to which pharmacists in Virginia are subject. And this case
concerns the retail sale by the pharmacist more than it does his professional
standards. Surely, any pharmacist guilty of professional dereliction that
actually endangers his customer will promptly lose his license. At the same time,
we cannot discount the Board's justifications entirely. The Court [has
previously] regarded justifications of this type sufficient to sustain the
advertising bans challenged on due process and equal protection grounds *** .
The challenge now made, however, is based on the First Amendment. This casts
the Board's justifications in a different light, for on close inspection it is seen
that the State's protectiveness of its citizens rests in large measure on the
advantages of their being kept in ignorance. The advertising ban does not
directly affect professional standards one way or the other. It affects them only
through the reactions it is assumed people will have to the free flow of drug
price information. There is no claim that the advertising ban in any way
prevents the cutting of corners by the pharmacist who is so inclined. That
pharmacist is likely to cut corners in any event. The only effect the advertising
ban has on him is to insulate him from price competition and to open the way
for him to make a substantial, and perhaps even excessive, profit in addition to
providing an inferior service. The more painstaking pharmacist is also protected
but, again, it is a protection based in large part on public ignorance.
It appears to be feared that if the pharmacist who wishes to provide low cost,
and assertedly low quality, services is permitted to advertise, he will be taken
up on his offer by too many unwitting customers. They will choose the low-cost,

Robson

698

The First Amendment

low-quality service and drive the "professional" pharmacist out of business.
They will respond only to costly and excessive advertising, and end up paying
the price. They will go from one pharmacist to another, following the discount,
and destroy the pharmacist-customer relationship. They will lose respect for the
profession because it advertises. All this is not in their best interests, and all
this can be avoided if they are not permitted to know who is charging what.
There is, of course, an alternative to this highly paternalistic approach. That
alternative is to assume that this information is not in itself harmful, that
people will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enough
informed, and that the best means to that end is to open the channels of
communication rather than to close them. If they are truly open, nothing
prevents the "professional" pharmacist from marketing his own assertedly
superior product, and contrasting it with that of the low-cost, high-volume
prescription drug retailer. But the choice among these alternative approaches is
not ours to make or the Virginia General Assembly's. It is precisely this kind of
choice, between the dangers of suppressing information, and the dangers of its
misuse if it is freely available, that the First Amendment makes for us. Virginia
is free to require whatever professional standards it wishes of its pharmacists; it
may subsidize them or protect them from competition in other ways. But it may
not do so by keeping the public in ignorance of the entirely lawful terms that
competing pharmacists are offering. In this sense, the justifications Virginia has
offered for suppressing the flow of prescription drug price information, far from
persuading us that the flow is not protected by the First Amendment, have
reinforced our view that it is. We so hold.
VI
In concluding that commercial speech, like other varieties, is protected, we of
course do not hold that it can never be regulated in any way. Some forms of
commercial speech regulation are surely permissible. We mention a few only to
make clear that they are not before us and therefore are not foreclosed by this
case.
There is no claim, for example, that the prohibition on prescription drug price
advertising is a mere time, place, and manner restriction. We have often
approved restrictions of that kind provided that they are justified without
reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they serve a significant
governmental interest, and that in so doing they leave open ample alternative
channels for communication of the information. Whatever may be the proper
bounds of time, place, and manner restrictions on commercial speech, they are
plainly exceeded by this Virginia statute, which singles out speech of a
particular content and seeks to prevent its dissemination completely.
Nor is there any claim that prescription drug price advertisements are forbidden
because they are false or misleading in any way. Untruthful speech, commercial
or otherwise, has never been protected for its own sake. Obviously, much
commercial speech is not provably false, or even wholly false, but only deceptive
or misleading. We foresee no obstacle to a State's dealing effectively with this
problem. The First Amendment, as we construe it today, does not prohibit the
State from insuring that the stream of commercial information flow cleanly as
well as freely.

Robson

699

The First Amendment

Also, there is no claim that the transactions proposed in the forbidden
advertisements are themselves illegal in any way. Finally, the special problems
of the electronic broadcast media are likewise not in this case.
What is at issue is whether a State may completely suppress the dissemination
of concededly truthful information about entirely lawful activity, fearful of that
information's effect upon its disseminators and its recipients. Reserving other
questions, we conclude that the answer to this one is in the negative.
The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, CONCURRING. [OMITTED]
JUSTICE STEWART, CONCURRING.
*** Today the Court ends the anomalous situation created by Chrestensen and
holds that a communication which does no more than propose a commercial
transaction is not "wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment." But
since it is a cardinal principle of the First Amendment that "government has no
power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter,
or its content," the Court's decision calls into immediate question the
constitutional legitimacy of every state and federal law regulating false or
deceptive advertising. I write separately to explain why I think today's decision
does not preclude such governmental regulation.
The Court has on several occasions addressed the problem posed by false
statements of fact in libel cases. Those cases demonstrate that even with
respect to expression at the core of the First Amendment, the Constitution does
not provide absolute protection for false factual statements that cause private
injury.***
The principles recognized in the libel decisions suggest that government may
take broader action to protect the public from injury produced by false or
deceptive price or product advertising than from harm caused by defamation.
***
Commercial price and product advertising differs markedly from ideological
expression because it is confined to the promotion of specific goods or services.
The First Amendment protects the advertisement because of the "information of
potential interest and value" conveyed, Bigelow v. Virginia, rather than because
of any direct contribution to the interchange of ideas. Since the factual claims
contained in commercial price or product advertisements relate to tangible
goods or services, they may be tested empirically and corrected to reflect the
truth without in any manner jeopardizing the free dissemination of thought.
Indeed, the elimination of false and deceptive claims serves to promote the one
facet of commercial price and product advertising that warrants First
Amendment protection—its contribution to the flow of accurate and reliable
information relevant to public and private decisionmaking.

Robson

JUSTICE REHNQUIST, DISSENTING.
The logical consequences of the Court's decision in this case, a decision which
elevates commercial intercourse between a seller hawking his wares and a
buyer seeking to strike a bargain to the same plane as has been previously
reserved for the free marketplace of ideas, are far reaching indeed. Under the
Court's opinion the way will be open not only for dissemination of price
information but for active promotion of prescription drugs, liquor, cigarettes,
and other products the use of which it has previously been thought desirable to
discourage. Now, however, such promotion is protected by the First Amendment
so long as it is not misleading or does not promote an illegal product or
enterprise. In coming to this conclusion, the Court has overruled a legislative
determination that such advertising should not be allowed and has done so on
behalf of a consumer group which is not directly disadvantaged by the statute
in question. This effort to reach a result which the Court obviously considers
desirable is a troublesome one, for two reasons. It extends standing to raise
First Amendment claims beyond the previous decisions of this Court. It also
extends the protection of that Amendment to purely commercial endeavors
which its most vigorous champions on this Court had thought to be beyond its
pale.
I
I do not find the question of the appellees' standing to urge the claim which the
Court decides quite as easy as the Court does. ***
Here, the only group truly restricted by this statute, the pharmacists, have not
even troubled to join in this litigation and may well feel that the expense and
competition of advertising is not in their interest.
II
Thus the issue on the merits is not, as the Court phrases it, whether "[o]ur
pharmacist" may communicate the fact that he "will sell you the X prescription
drug at the Y price." No pharmacist is asserting any such claim to so
communicate. The issue is rather whether appellee consumers may override the
legislative determination that pharmacists should not advertise even though the
pharmacists themselves do not object. In deciding that they may do so, the
Court necessarily adopts a rule which cannot be limited merely to
dissemination of price alone, and which cannot possibly be confined to
pharmacists but must likewise extend to lawyers, doctors, and all other
professions.
The Court speaks of the consumer's interest in the free flow of commercial
information, particularly in the case of the poor, the sick, and the aged. It goes
on to observe that "society also may have a strong interest in the free flow of
commercial information." One need not disagree with either of these statements
in order to feel that they should presumptively be the concern of the Virginia
Legislature, which sits to balance these and other claims in the process of
making laws such as the one here under attack. The Court speaks of the
importance in a "predominantly free enterprise economy" of intelligent and wellinformed decisions as to allocation of resources. While there is again much to
be said for the Court's observation as a matter of desirable public policy, there
is certainly nothing in the United States Constitution which requires the

Robson

701

The First Amendment

Virginia Legislature to hew to the teachings of Adam Smith in its legislative
decisions regulating the pharmacy profession.
*** Similarly in Williamson v. Lee Optical Co. (1955), the Court, in dealing with a
state prohibition against the advertisement of eyeglass frames, held: "We see no
constitutional reason why a State may not treat all who deal with the human
eye as members of a profession who should use no merchandising methods for
obtaining customers."
*** The Court concedes that legislatures may prohibit false and misleading
advertisements, and may likewise prohibit advertisements seeking to induce
transactions which are themselves illegal. In a final footnote the opinion tosses
a bone to the traditionalists in the legal and medical professions by suggesting
that because they sell services rather than drugs the holding of this case is not
automatically applicable to advertising in those professions. But if the sole
limitation on permissible state proscription of advertising is that it may not be
false or misleading, surely the difference between pharmacists' advertising and
lawyers' and doctors' advertising can be only one of degree and not of kind. I
cannot distinguish between the public's right to know the price of drugs and its
right to know the price of title searches or physical examinations or other
professional services for which standardized fees are charged. Nor is it apparent
how the pharmacists in this case are less engaged in a regulatable profession
than were the opticians in Williamson.
*** There are undoubted difficulties with an effort to draw a bright line between
"commercial speech" on the one hand and "protected speech" on the other, and
the Court does better to face up to these difficulties than to attempt to hide
them under labels. In this case, however, the Court has unfortunately
substituted for the wavering line previously thought to exist between
commercial speech and protected speech a no more satisfactory line of its
own—that between "truthful" commercial speech, on the one hand, and that
which is "false and misleading" on the other. The difficulty with this line is not
that it wavers, but on the contrary that it is simply too Procrustean to take into
account the congeries of factors which I believe could, quite consistently with
the First and Fourteenth Amendments, properly influence a legislative decision
with respect to commercial advertising.
The Court insists that the rule it lays down is consistent even with the view that
the First Amendment is "primarily an instrument to enlighten public
decisionmaking in a democracy." I had understood this view to relate to public
decisionmaking as to political, social, and other public issues, rather than the
decision of a particular individual as to whether to purchase one or another
kind of shampoo. It is undoubtedly arguable that many people in the country
regard the choice of shampoo as just as important as who may be elected to
local, state, or national political office, but that does not automatically bring
information about competing shampoos within the protection of the First
Amendment. It is one thing to say that the line between strictly ideological and
political commentaries and other kinds of commentary is difficult to draw, and
that the mere fact that the former may have in it an element of commercialism
does not strip it of First Amendment protection. See New York Times Co. v.
Sullivan (1964). But it is another thing to say that because that line is difficult
to draw, we will stand at the other end of the spectrum and reject out of hand

Robson

702

The First Amendment

the observation of so dedicated a champion of the First Amendment as Mr.
Justice Black that the protections of that Amendment do not apply to a
"`merchant' who goes from door to door `selling pots.'" Breard v. City of
Alexandria (1951) (dissenting).
In the case of "our" hypothetical pharmacist, he may now presumably advertise
not only the prices of prescription drugs, but may attempt to energetically
promote their sale so long as he does so truthfully. Quite consistently with
Virginia law requiring prescription drugs to be available only through a
physician, "our" pharmacist might run any of the following representative
advertisements in a local newspaper:
"Pain getting you down? Insist that your physician prescribe Demerol.
You pay a little more than for aspirin, but you get a lot more relief."
"Can't shake the flu? Get a prescription for Tetracycline from your doctor
today."
"Don't spend another sleepless night. Ask your doctor to prescribe
Seconal without delay."
Unless the State can show that these advertisements are either actually
untruthful or misleading, it presumably is not free to restrict in any way
commercial efforts on the part of those who profit from the sale of prescription
drugs to put them in the widest possible circulation. But such a line simply
makes no allowance whatever for what appears to have been a considered
legislative judgment in most States that while prescription drugs are a
necessary and vital part of medical care and treatment, there are sufficient
dangers attending their widespread use that they simply may not be promoted
in the same manner as hair creams, deodorants, and toothpaste. The very real
dangers that general advertising for such drugs might create in terms of
encouraging, even though not sanctioning, illicit use of them by individuals for
whom they have not been prescribed, or by generating patient pressure upon
physicians to prescribe them, are simply not dealt with in the Court's opinion. If
prescription drugs may be advertised, they may be advertised on television
during family viewing time. Nothing we know about the acquisitive instincts of
those who inhabit every business and profession to a greater or lesser extent
gives any reason to think that such persons will not do everything they can to
generate demand for these products in much the same manner and to much
the same degree as demand for other commodities has been generated.
Both Congress and state legislatures have by law sharply limited the
permissible dissemination of information about some commodities because of
the potential harm resulting from those commodities, even though they were
not thought to be sufficiently demonstrably harmful to warrant outright
prohibition of their sale. Current prohibitions on television advertising of liquor
and cigarettes are prominent in this category, but apparently under the Court's
holding so long as the advertisements are not deceptive they may no longer be
prohibited.
This case presents a fairly typical First Amendment problem—that of balancing
interests in individual free speech against public welfare determinations
embodied in a legislative enactment. ***

Robson

703

The First Amendment

Here the rights of the appellees seem to me to be marginal at best. There is no
ideological content to the information which they seek and it is freely available
to them—they may even publish it if they so desire. The only persons directly
affected by this statute are not parties to this lawsuit. On the other hand, the
societal interest against the promotion of drug use for every ill, real or
imaginary, seems to me extremely strong. I do not believe that the First
Amendment mandates the Court's "open door policy" toward such commercial
advertising.

Notes	  
1.
Why did the Court originally decide commercial speech should be
excluded from First Amendment protection? Is there any contemporary
merit to such a position?
2.
Justice Rehnquist’s dissenting opinion in Virginia State Pharmacy
Board contains a “parade of horribles” that have mostly been realized. Is
this the necessary consequence of a capitalist society in which a
“particular consumer's interest in the free flow of commercial information”
“may be as keen, if not keener by far, than his interest in the day's most
urgent political debate,” as Justice Blackmun writes for the Court?

WHICH BRENNAN, J., JOINED. REHNQUIST, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION.

JUSTICE POWELL DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The case presents the question whether a regulation of the Public Service
Commission of the state of New York violates the First and Fourteenth
Amendments because it completely bans promotional advertising by an
electrical utility.
I
In December 1973, the Commission, appellee here, ordered electric utilities in
New York State to cease all advertising that "promot[es] the use of electricity."
The order was based on the Commission's finding that "the interconnected
utility system in New York State does not have sufficient fuel stocks or sources
Robson

704

The First Amendment

of supply to continue furnishing all customer demands for the 1973-1974
winter."
Three years later, when the fuel shortage had eased, the Commission requested
comments from the public on its proposal to continue the ban on promotional
advertising. Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp., the appellant in this case,
opposed the ban on First Amendment grounds. After reviewing the public
comments, the Commission extended the prohibition in a Policy Statement
issued on February 25, 1977.
The Policy Statement divided advertising expenses "into two broad categories:
promotional—advertising intended to stimulate the purchase of utility
services—and institutional and informational, a broad category inclusive of all
advertising not clearly intended to promote sales." The Commission declared all
promotional advertising contrary to the national policy of conserving energy. It
acknowledged that the ban is not a perfect vehicle for conserving energy. For
example, the Commissioner's order prohibits promotional advertising to develop
consumption during periods when demand for electricity is low. By limiting
growth in "off-peak" consumption, the ban limits the "beneficial side effects" of
such growth in terms of more efficient use of existing powerplants. And since oil
dealers are not under the Commissioner's jurisdiction and thus remain free to
advertise, it was recognized that the ban can achieve only "piecemeal
conservationism." Still, the Commission adopted the restriction because it was
deemed likely to "result in some dampening of unnecessary growth" in energy
consumption.
The Commission's order explicitly permitted "informational" advertising
designed to encourage "shifts of consumption" from peak demand times to
periods of low electricity demand. (emphasis in original). Information
advertising would not seek to increase aggregate consumption, but would invite
a leveling of demand throughout any given 24-hour period. The agency offered
to review "specific proposals by the companies for specifically described
[advertising] programs that meet these criteria."
When it rejected requests for rehearing on the Policy Statement, the
Commission supplemented its rationale for the advertising ban. The agency
observed that additional electricity probably would be more expensive to
produce than existing output. Because electricity rates in New York were not
then based on marginal cost, the Commission feared that additional power
would be priced below the actual cost of generation. The additional electricity
would be subsidized by all consumers through generally higher rates. The state
agency also thought that promotional advertising would give "misleading
signals" to the public by appearing to encourage energy consumption at a time
when conservation is needed.
Appellant challenged the order in state court, arguing that the Commission had
restrained commercial speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. The Commission's order was upheld by the trial court and at the
intermediate appellate level. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed. It found
little value to advertising in "the noncompetitive market in which electric
corporations operate." Since consumers "have no choice regarding the source of
their electric power," the court denied that "promotional advertising of electricity

Robson

705

The First Amendment

might contribute to society's interest in `informed and reliable' economic
decisionmaking." The court also observed that by encouraging consumption,
promotional advertising would only exacerbate the current energy situation.
The court concluded that the governmental interest in the prohibition
outweighed the limited constitutional value of the commercial speech at issue.
We noted probable jurisdiction, and now reverse.
II
The Commission's order restricts only commercial speech, that is, expression
related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience. Virginia
Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council (1976). The First
Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,
protects commercial speech from unwarranted governmental regulation.
Commercial expression not only serves the economic interest of the speaker,
but also assists consumers and furthers the societal interest in the fullest
possible dissemination of information. In applying the First Amendment to this
area, we have rejected the "highly paternalistic" view that government has
complete power to suppress or regulate commercial speech. "[P]eople will
perceive their own best interest if only they are well enough informed, and . . .
the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication, rather
than to close them. . . ." Even when advertising communicates only an
incomplete version of the relevant facts, the First Amendment presumes that
some accurate information is better than no information at all.
Nevertheless, our decisions have recognized "the `commonsense' distinction
between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area
traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech."
The Constitution therefore accords a lesser protection to commercial speech
than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression. The protection available
for particular commercial expression turns on the nature both of the expression
and of the governmental interests served by its regulation.
The First Amendment's concern for commercial speech is based on the
informational function of advertising. See First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti
(1978). Consequently, there can be no constitutional objection to the
suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the public
about lawful activity. The government may ban forms of communication more
likely to deceive the public than to inform it, or commercial speech related to
illegal activity.
If the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity, the
government's power is more circumscribed. The State must assert a substantial
interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech. Moreover, the
regulatory technique must be in proportion to that interest. The limitation on
expression must be designed carefully to achieve the State's goal. Compliance
with this requirement may be measured by two criteria. First, the restriction
must directly advance the state interest involved; the regulation may not be
sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's
purpose. Second, if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more
limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive restrictions cannot
survive.

Robson

706

The First Amendment

Under the first criterion, the Court has declined to uphold regulations that only
indirectly advance the state interest involved. In both Bates [v. State Bar of
Arizona (1977)] and Virginia Pharmacy Board, the Court concluded that an
advertising ban could not be imposed to protect the ethical or performance
standards of a profession. The Court noted in Virginia Pharmacy Board that
"[t]he advertising ban does not directly affect professional standards one way or
the other." In Bates, the Court overturned an advertising prohibition that was
designed to protect the "quality" of a lawyer's work. "Restraints on
advertising . . . are an ineffective way of deterring shoddy work."
The second criterion recognizes that the First Amendment mandates that
speech restrictions be "narrowly drawn." The regulatory technique may extend
only as far as the interest it serves. The State cannot regulate speech that poses
no danger to the asserted state interest, see First National Bank of Boston v.
Bellotti, nor can it completely suppress information when narrower restrictions
on expression would serve its interest as well. For example, in Bates the Court
explicitly did not "foreclose the possibility that some limited supplementation,
by way of warning or disclaimer or the like might be required" in promotional
materials. And in Carey v. Population Services International (1977), we held that
the State's "arguments . . . do not justify the total suppression of advertising
concerning contraceptives." This holding left open the possibility that the State
could implement more carefully drawn restrictions.
In commercial speech cases, then, a four-part analysis has developed. At the
outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First
Amendment. For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least
must concern lawful activity and not be misleading. Next, we ask whether the
asserted governmental interest is substantial. If both inquiries yield positive
answers, we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the
governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is
necessary to serve that interest.
III
We now apply this four-step analysis for commercial speech to the
Commission's arguments in support of its ban on promotional advertising.
A
The Commission does not claim that the expression at issue either is inaccurate
or relates to unlawful activity. Yet the New York Court of Appeals questioned
whether Central Hudson's advertising is protected commercial speech. Because
appellant holds a monopoly over the sale of electricity in its service area, the
state court suggested that the Commission's order restricts no commercial
speech of any worth. The court stated that advertising in a "noncompetitive
market" could not improve the decisionmaking of consumers. The court saw no
constitutional problem with barring commercial speech that it viewed as
conveying little useful information.
The reasoning falls short of establishing that apellant's advertising is not
commercial speech protected by the First Amendment. Monopoly over the
supply of a product provides no protection from competition with substitutes
for that product. Electric utilities compete with suppliers of fuel oil land natural
gas in several markets, such as those for home heating and industrial power.
This Court noted the existence of interfuel competition 45 years ago. Each

Robson

707

The First Amendment

energy source continues to offer peculiar advantages and disadvantages that
may influence consumer choice. For consumers in those competitive markets,
advertising by utilities is just as valuable as advertising by unregulated firms.
Even in monopoly markets, the suppression of advertising reduces the
information available for consumer decisions and thereby defeats the purpose
of the First Amendment. The New York court's argument appears to assume
that the providers of a monopoly service or product are willing to pay for wholly
ineffective advertising. Most businesses— even regulated monopolies—are
unlikely to underwrite promotional advertising that is of no interest or use to
consumers. Indeed, a monopoly enterprise legitimately may wish to inform the
public that it has developed new services or terms of doing business. A
consumer may need information to aid his decision whether or not to use the
monopoly services at all, or how much of the service he should purchase. In the
absence of factors that would distort the decision to advertise, we may assume
that the willingness of a business to promote its products reflects a belief that
consumers are interested in the advertising. Since no such extraordinary
conditions have been identified in this case, appellant's monopoly position does
not alter the First Amendment's protection for its commercial speech.
B
The Commission offers two state interests as justifications for the ban on
promotional advertising. The first concerns energy conservation. Any increase
in demand for electricity— during peak or off-peak periods—means greater
consumption of energy. The Commission argues, and the New York court
agreed, that the State's interest in conserving energy is sufficient to support
suppression of advertising designed to increase consumption of electricity. In
view of our country's dependence on energy resources beyond our control, no
one can doubt the importance of energy conservation. Plainly, therefore, the
state interest asserted is substantial.
The Commission also argues that promotional advertising will aggravate
inequities caused by the failure to base the utilities' rates on marginal cost. The
utilities argued to the Commission that if they could promote the use of
electricity in periods of low demand, they would improve their utilization of
generating capacity. The Commission responded that promotion of off-peak
consumption also would increase consumption during peak periods. If peak
demand were to rise, the absence of marginal cost rates would mean that the
rates charged for the additional power would not reflect the true costs of
expanding production. Instead, the extra costs would be borne by all
consumers through higher overall rates. Without promotional advertising, the
Commission stated, this inequitable turn of events would be less likely to occur.
The choice among rate structures involves difficult and important questions of
economic supply and distributional fairness. The State's concern that rates be
fair and efficient represents a clear and substantial governmental interest.
C
Next, we focus on the relationship between the State's interests and the
advertising ban. Under this criterion, the Commission's laudable concern over
the equity and efficiency of appellant's rates does not provide a constitutionally
adequate reason for restricting protected speech. The link between the
advertising prohibition and appellant's rate structure is, at most, tenuous. The

Robson

708

The First Amendment

impact of promotional advertising on the equity of appellant's rates is highly
speculative. Advertising to increase off-peak usage would have to increase peak
usage, while other factors that directly affect the fairness and efficiency of
appellant's rates remained constant. Such conditional and remote eventualities
simply cannot justify silencing appellant's promotional advertising.
In contrast, the State's interest in energy conservation is directly advanced by
the Commission order at issue here. There is an immediate connection between
advertising and demand for electricity. Central Hudson would not contest the
advertising ban unless it believed that promotion would increase its sales. Thus,
we find a direct link between the state interest in conservation and the
Commission's order.
D
We come finally to the critical inquiry in this case: whether the Commission's
complete suppression of speech ordinarily protected by the First Amendment is
no more extensive than necessary to further the State's interest in energy
conservation. The Commission's order reaches all promotional advertising,
regardless of the impact of the touted service on overall energy use. But the
energy conservation rationale, as important as it is, cannot justify suppressing
information about electric devices or services that would cause no net increase
in total energy use. In addition, no showing has been made that a more limited
restriction on the content of promotional advertising would not serve adequately
the State's interests.
Appellant insists that but for the ban, it would advertise products and services
that use energy efficiently. These include the "heat pump," which both parties
acknowledge to be a major improvement in electric heating, and the use of
electric heat as a "backup" to solar and other heat sources. Although the
Commission has questioned the efficiency of electric heating before this Court,
neither the Commission's Policy Statement nor its order denying rehearing
made findings on this issue. In the absence of authoritative findings to the
contrary, we must credit as within the realm of possibility the claim that electric
heat can be an efficient alternative in some circumstances.
The Commission's order prevents appellant from promoting electric services
that would reduce energy use by diverting demand from less efficient sources,
or that would consume roughly the same amount of energy as do alternative
sources. In neither situation would the utility's advertising endanger
conservation or mislead the public. To the extent that the Commission's order
suppresses speech that in no way impairs the State's interest in energy
conservation, the Commission's order violates the First and Fourteenth
Amendments and must be invalidated. See First National Bank of Boston v.
Bellotti (1978).
The Commission also has not demonstrated that its interest in conservation
cannot be protected adequately by more limited regulation of appellant's
commercial expression. To further its policy of conservation, the Commission
could attempt to restrict the format and content of Central Hudson's advertising.
It might, for example, require that the advertisements include information
about the relative efficiency and expense of the offered service, both under
current conditions and for the foreseeable future. In the absence of a showing

Robson

709

The First Amendment

that more limited speech regulation would be ineffective, we cannot approve the
complete suppression of Central Hudson's advertising.
IV
Our decision today in no way disparages the national interest in energy
conservation. We accept without reservation the argument that conservation, as
well as the development of alternative energy sources, is an imperative national
goal. Administrative bodies empowered to regulate electric utilities have the
authority—and indeed the duty—to take appropriate action to further this goal.
When, however, such action involves the suppression of speech, the First and
Fourteenth Amendments require that the restriction be no more extensive than
is necessary to serve the state interest. In this case, the record before us fails to
show that the total ban on promotional advertising meets this requirement.
Accordingly, the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals is
Reversed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
One of the major difficulties in this case is the proper characterization of the
Commission's Policy Statement. I find it impossible to determine on the present
record whether the Commission's ban on all "promotional" advertising, in
contrast to "institutional and informational" advertising, is intended to
encompass more than "commercial speech." ***
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE BRENNAN JOINS, CONCURRING IN THE
JUDGMENT.
I agree with the Court that the Public Service Commission's ban on promotional
advertising of electricity by public utilities is inconsistent with the First and
Fourteenth Amendments. I concur only in the Court's judgment, however,
because I believe the test now evolved and applied by the Court is not
consistent with our prior cases and does not provide adequate protection for
truthful, nonmisleading, noncoercive commercial speech.
The Court asserts that "a four-part analysis has developed" from our decisions
concerning commercial speech. Under this four-part test a restraint on
commercial "communication [that] is neither misleading nor related to unlawful
activity" is subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny, and suppression is
permitted whenever it "directly advances" a "substantial" governmental interest
and is "not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest." I agree with
the Court that this level of intermediate scrutiny is appropriate for a restraint
on commercial speech designed to protect consumers from misleading or
coercive speech, or a regulation related to the time, place, or manner of
commercial speech. I do not agree, however, that the Court's four-part test is
the proper one to be applied when a State seeks to suppress information about
a product in order to manipulate a private economic decision that the State
cannot or has not regulated or outlawed directly.
Since the Court, without citing empirical data or other authority, finds a "direct
link" between advertising and energy consumption, it leaves open the possibility
Robson

710

The First Amendment

that the State may suppress advertising of electricity in order to lessen demand
for electricity. I, of course, agree with the Court that, in today's world, energy
conservation is a goal of paramount national and local importance. I disagree
with the Court, however, when it says that suppression of speech may be a
permissible means to achieve that goal. ***
The Court recognizes that we have never held that commercial speech may be
suppressed in order to further the State's interest in discouraging purchases of
the underlying product that is advertised. Permissible restraints on commercial
speech have been limited to measures designed to protect consumers from
fraudulent, misleading, or coercive sales techniques. Those designed to deprive
consumers of information about products or services that are legally offered for
sale consistently have been invalidated.
I seriously doubt whether suppression of information concerning the availability
and price of a legally offered product is ever a permissible way for the State to
"dampen" demand for or use of the product. Even though "commercial" speech
is involved, such a regulatory measure strikes at the heart of the First
Amendment. This is because it is a covert attempt by the State to manipulate
the choices of its citizens, not by persuasion or direct regulation, but by
depriving the public of the information needed to make a free choice. As the
Court recognizes, the State's policy choices are insulated from the visibility and
scrutiny that direct regulation would entail and the conduct of citizens is
molded by the information that government chooses to give them.
If the First Amendment guarantee means anything, it means that, absent clear
and present danger, government has no power to restrict expression because of
the effect its message is likely to have on the public. Our cases indicate that
this guarantee applies even to commercial speech. In Virginia Pharmacy Board v.
Virginia Consumer Council (1976), we held that Virginia could not pursue its
goal of encouraging the public to patronize the "professional pharmacist" (one
who provided individual attention and a stable pharmacist-customer
relationship) by "keeping the public in ignorance of the entirely lawful terms
that competing pharmacists are offering." We noted that our decision left the
State free to pursue its goal of maintaining high standards among its
pharmacists by "requir[ing] whatever professional standards it wishes of its
pharmacists."
*** Our prior references to the "`commonsense differences'" between commercial
speech and other speech "`suggest that a different degree of protection is
necessary to insure that the flow of truthful and legitimate commercial
information is unimpaired.'" We have not suggested that the "commonsense
differences" between commercial speech and other speech justify relaxed
scrutiny of restraints that suppress truthful, nondeceptive, noncoercive
commercial speech. The differences articulated by the Court justify a more
permissive approach to regulation of the manner of commercial speech for the
purpose of protecting consumers from deception or coercion, and these
differences explain why doctrines designed to prevent "chilling" of protected
speech are inapplicable to commercial speech. No differences between
commercial speech and other protected speech justify suppression of
commercial speech in order to influence public conduct through manipulation
of the availability of information. ***

Robson

711

The First Amendment

It appears that the Court would permit the State to ban all direct advertising of
air conditioning, assuming that a more limited restriction on such advertising
would not effectively deter the public from cooling its homes. In my view, our
cases do not support this type of suppression. If a governmental unit believes
that use or overuse of air conditioning is a serious problem, it must attack that
problem directly, by prohibiting air conditioning or regulating thermostat levels.
Just as the Commonwealth of Virginia may promote professionalism of
pharmacists directly, so too New York may not promote energy conservation "by
keeping the public in ignorance."
JUSTICE STEVENS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE BRENNAN JOINS, CONCURRING IN THE
JUDGMENT.
Because "commercial speech" is afforded less constitutional protection than
other forms of speech, it is important that the commercial speech concept not
be defined too broadly lest speech deserving of greater constitutional protection
be inadvertently suppressed. The issue in this case is whether New York's
prohibition on the promotion of the use of electricity through advertising is a
ban on nothing but commercial speech.
In my judgment one of the two definitions the Court uses in addressing that
issue is too broad and the other may be somewhat too narrow. The Court first
describes commercial speech as "expression related solely to the economic
interests of the speaker and its audience." Although it is not entirely clear
whether this definition uses the subject matter of the speech or the motivation
of the speaker as the limiting factor, it seems clear to me that it encompasses
speech that is entitled to the maximum protection afforded by the First
Amendment. Neither a labor leader's exhortation to strike, nor an economist's
dissertation on the money supply, should receive any lesser protection because
the subject matter concerns only the economic interests of the audience. Nor
should the economic motivation of a speaker qualify his constitutional
protection; even Shakespeare may have been motivated by the prospect of
pecuniary reward. Thus, the Court's first definition of commercial speech is
unquestionably too broad.
The Court's second definition refers to "`speech proposing a commercial
transaction.'" A salesman's solicitation, a broker's offer, and a manufacturer's
publication of a price list or the terms of his standard warranty would
unquestionably fit within this concept. Presumably, the definition is intended to
encompass advertising that advises possible buyers of the availability of specific
products at specific prices and describes the advantages of purchasing such
items. Perhaps it also extends to other communications that do little more than
make the name of a product or a service more familiar to the general public.
Whatever the precise contours of the concept, and perhaps it is too early to
enunciate an exact formulation, I am persuaded that it should not include the
entire range of communication that is embraced within the term "promotional
advertising."
This case involves a governmental regulation that completely bans promotional
advertising by an electric utility. This ban encompasses a great deal more than
mere proposals to engage in certain kinds of commercial transactions. It

Robson

712

The First Amendment

prohibits all advocacy of the immediate or future use of electricity. It curtails
expression by an informed and interested group of persons of their point of view
on questions relating to the production and consumption of electrical energy—
questions frequently discussed and debated by our political leaders. For
example, an electric company's advocacy of the use of electric heat for
environmental reasons, as opposed to wood-burning stoves, would seem to fall
squarely within New York's promotional advertising ban and also within the
bounds of maximum First Amendment protection. The breadth of the ban thus
exceeds the boundaries of the commercial speech concept, however that
concept may be defined.
The justification for the regulation is nothing more than the expressed fear that
the audience may find the utility's message persuasive. Without the aid of any
coercion, deception, or misinformation, truthful communication may persuade
some citizens to consume more electricity than they otherwise would. I assume
that such a consequence would be undesirable and that government may
therefore prohibit and punish the unnecessary or excessive use of electricity.
But if the perceived harm associated with greater electrical usage is not
sufficiently serious to justify direct regulation, surely it does not constitute the
kind of clear and present danger that can justify the suppression of speech.
Although they were written in a different context, the words used by Mr. Justice
Brandeis in his concurring opinion in Whitney v. California, explain my reaction
to the prohibition against advocacy involved in this case:
"But even advocacy of violation, however reprehensible morally, is not a
justification for denying free speech where the advocacy falls short of
incitement and there is nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be
immediately acted on. The wide difference between advocacy and
incitement, between preparation and attempt, between assembling and
conspiracy, must be borne in mind. In order to support a finding of clear
and present danger it must be shown either that immediate serious
violence was to be expected or was advocated, or that the past conduct
furnished reason to believe that such advocacy was then contemplated.
"Those who won our independence by revolution were not cowards. They
did not fear political change. They did not exalt order at the cost of
liberty. To courageous, self-reliant men, with confidence in the power of
free and fearless reasoning applied through the processes of popular
government, no danger flowing from speech can be deemed clear and
present, unless the incidence of the evil apprehended is so imminent that
it may befall before there is opportunity for full discussion. If there be
time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert
the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more
speech, not enforced silence. Only an emergency can justify repression.
Such must be the rule if authority is to be reconciled with freedom. Such,
in my opinion, is the command of the Constitution." (Footnote omitted.)
In sum, I concur in the result because I do not consider this to be a
"commercial speech" case. Accordingly, I see no need to decide whether the
Court's four-part analysis, adequately protects commercial speech—as properly
defined— in the face of a blanket ban of the sort involved in this case.

The First Amendment

JUSTICE REHNQUIST, DISSENTING.
The Court today invalidates an order issued by the New York Public Service
Commission designed to promote a policy that has been declared to be of
critical national concern. The order was issued by the Commission in 1973 in
response to the Mideastern oil embargo crisis. It prohibits electric corporations
"from promoting the use of electricity through the use of advertising, subsidy
payments . . . , or employee incentives." State of New York Public Service
Commission, Case No. 26532 (Dec. 5, 1973) (emphasis added). Although the
immediate crisis created by the oil embargo has subsided, the ban on
promotional advertising remains in effect. The regulation was re-examined by
the New York Public Service Commission in 1977. Its constitutionality was
subsequently upheld by the New York Court of Appeals, which concluded that
the paramount national interest in energy conservation justified its retention.
The Court's asserted justification for invalidating the New York law is the public
interest discerned by the Court to underlie the First Amendment in the free flow
of commercial information. Prior to this Court's recent decision in Virginia
Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council (1976), however,
commercial speech was afforded no protection under the First Amendment
whatsoever. See, e. g., Breard v. Alexandria (1951); Valentine v. Chrestensen,
(1942). Given what seems to me full recognition of the holding of Virginia
Pharmacy Board that commercial speech is entitled to some degree of First
Amendment protection, I think the Court is nonetheless incorrect in
invalidating the carefully considered state ban on promotional advertising in
light of pressing national and state energy needs.
The Court's analysis in my view is wrong in several respects. Initially, I disagree
with the Court's conclusion that the speech of a state-created monopoly, which
is the subject of a comprehensive regulatory scheme, is entitled to protection
under the First Amendment. I also think that the Court errs here in failing to
recognize that the state law is most accurately viewed as an economic
regulation and that the speech involved (if it falls within the scope of the First
Amendment at all) occupies a significantly more subordinate position in the
hierarchy of First Amendment values than the Court gives it today. Finally, the
Court in reaching its decision improperly substitutes its own judgment for that
of the State in deciding how a proper ban on promotional advertising should be
drafted. With regard to this latter point, the Court adopts as its final part of a
four-part test a "no more extensive than necessary" analysis that will unduly
impair a state legislature's ability to adopt legislation reasonably designed to
promote interests that have always been rightly thought to be of great
importance to the State.
I
In concluding that appellant's promotional advertising constitutes protected
speech, the Court reasons that speech by electric utilities is valuable to
consumers who must decide whether to use the monopoly service or turn to an
alternative energy source, and if they decide to use the service how much of it
to purchase. The Court in so doing "assume[s] that the willingness of a
business to promote its products reflects a belief that consumers are interested
in the advertising." The Court's analysis ignores the fact that the monopoly here

Robson

714

The First Amendment

is entirely state-created and subject to an extensive state regulatory scheme
from which it derives benefits as well as burdens.
While this Court has stated that the "capacity [of speech] for informing the
public does not depend upon the identity of its source," First National Bank of
Boston v. Bellotti (1978), the source of the speech nevertheless may be relevant
in determining whether a given message is protected under the First
Amendment. When the source of the speech is a state-created monopoly such
as this, traditional First Amendment concerns, if they come into play at all,
certainly do not justify the broad interventionist role adopted by the Court
today. ***
Thus, although First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti holds that speech of a
corporation is entitled to some First Amendment protection, it by no means
follows that a utility with monopoly power conferred by a State is also entitled
to such protection.
The state-created monopoly status of a utility arises from the unique
characteristics of the services that a utility provides. *** A utility, by contrast,
fulfills a function that serves special public interests as a result of the natural
monopoly of the service provided. Indeed, the extensive regulations governing
decisionmaking by public utilities suggest that for purposes of First
Amendment analysis, a utility is far closer to a state-controlled enterprise than
is an ordinary corporation. Accordingly, I think a State has broad discretion in
determining the statements that a utility may make in that such statements
emanate from the entity created by the State to provide important and unique
public services. And a state regulatory body charged with the oversight of these
types of services may reasonably decide to impose on the utility a special duty
to conform its conduct to the agency's conception of the public interest. Thus I
think it is constitutionally permissible for it to decide that promotional
advertising is inconsistent with the public interest in energy conservation. I also
think New York's ban on such advertising falls within the scope of permissible
state regulation of an economic activity by an entity that could not exist in
corporate form, say nothing of enjoy monopoly status, were it not for the laws of
New York.
II
This Court has previously recognized that although commercial speech may be
entitled to First Amendment protection, that protection is not as extensive as
that accorded to the advocacy of ideas. ***
The Court's decision today fails to give due deference to this subordinate
position of commercial speech. The Court in so doing returns to the bygone era
of Lochner v. New York (1905), in which it was common practice for this Court
to strike down economic regulations adopted by a State based on the Court's
own notions of the most appropriate means for the State to implement its
considered policies.
I had thought by now it had become well established that a State has broad
discretion in imposing economic regulations. ***
The State of New York has determined here that economic realities require the
grant of monopoly status to public utilities in order to distribute efficiently the

Robson

715

The First Amendment

services they provide, and in granting utilities such status it has made them
subject to an extensive regulatory scheme. When the State adopted this scheme
and when its Public Service Commission issued its initial ban on promotional
advertising in 1973, commercial speech had not been held to fall within the
scope of the First Amendment at all. Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens
Consumer Council (1976), however, subsequently accorded commercial speech a
limited measure of First Amendment protection.
The Court today holds not only that commercial speech is entitled to First
Amendment protection, but also that when it is protected a State may not
regulate it unless its reason for doing so amounts to a "substantial"
governmental interest, its regulation "directly advances" that interest, and its
manner of regulation is "not more extensive than necessary" to serve the
interest. The test adopted by the Court thus elevates the protection accorded
commercial speech that falls within the scope of the First Amendment to a level
that is virtually indistinguishable from that of noncommercial speech. I think
the Court in so doing has effectively accomplished the "devitalization" of the
First Amendment that it counseled against in Ohralik [v. Ohio State Bar Assn.
(1978)]. I think it has also, by labeling economic regulation of business conduct
as a restraint on "free speech," gone far to resurrect the discredited doctrine of
cases such as Lochner and Tyson & Brother v. Banton (1927). New York's order
here is in my view more akin to an economic regulation to which virtually
complete deference should be accorded by this Court.
I doubt there would be any question as to the constitutionality of New York's
conservation effort if the Public Service Commission had chosen to raise the
price of electricity, to condition its sale on specified terms, or to restrict its
production. In terms of constitutional values, I think that such controls are
virtually indistinguishable from the State's ban on promotional advertising.
An ostensible justification for striking down New York's ban on promotional
advertising is that this Court has previously "rejected the `highly paternalistic'
view that government has complete power to suppress or regulate commercial
speech. `[P]eople will perceive their own best interests if only they are well
enough informed and . . . the best means to that end is to open the channels of
communication, rather than to close them. . . .'". Whatever the merits of this
view, I think the Court has carried its logic too far here.
The view apparently derives from the Court's frequent reference to the
"marketplace of ideas," which was deemed analogous to the commercial market
in which a laissez-faire policy would lead to optimum economic decisionmaking
under the guidance of the "invisible hand." See, e. g., ADAM SMITH, WEALTH OF
NATIONS (1776). This notion was expressed by Mr. Justice Holmes in his
dissenting opinion in Abrams v. United States (1919), wherein he stated that
"the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the
competition of the market. . . ." See also, e. g., J. MILL, ON LIBERTY (1858); J.
MILTON, AREOPAGITICA, A SPEECH FOR THE LIBERTY OF UNLICENSED PRINTING (1644).
While it is true that an important objective of the First Amendment is to foster
the free flow of information, identification of speech that falls within its
protection is not aided by the metaphorical reference to a "marketplace of
ideas." There is no reason for believing that the marketplace of ideas is free

Robson

716

The First Amendment

from market imperfections any more than there is to believe that the invisible
hand will always lead to optimum economic decisions in the commercial market.
Indeed, many types of speech have been held to fall outside the scope of the
First Amendment, thereby subject to governmental regulation, despite this
Court's references to a marketplace of ideas. See, e.g., Chaplinsky v. New
Hampshire (1942) (fighting words); Beauharnais v. Illinois (1952) (group libel);
Roth v. United States (1957) (obscenity). It also has been held that the
government has a greater interest in regulating some types of protected speech
than others. See, e. g., FCC v. Pacifica Foundation (1978) (indecent speech);
Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council (commercial
speech). And as this Court stated in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974): "Of
course, an opportunity for rebuttal seldom suffices to undo [the] harm of a
defamatory falsehood. Indeed the law of defamation is rooted in our experience
that the truth rarely catches up with a lie." The Court similarly has recognized
that false and misleading commercial speech is not entitled to any First
Amendment protection.
The above examples illustrate that in a number of instances government may
constitutionally decide that societal interests justify the imposition of
restrictions on the free flow of information. When the question is whether a
given commercial message is protected, I do not think this Court's
determination that the information will "assist" consumers justifies judicial
invalidation of a reasonably drafted state restriction on such speech when the
restriction is designed to promote a concededly substantial state interest. I
consequently disagree with the Court's conclusion that the societal interest in
the dissemination of commercial information is sufficient to justify a restriction
on the State's authority to regulate promotional advertising by utilities; indeed,
in the case of a regulated monopoly, it is difficult for me to distinguish "society"
from the state legislature and the Public Service Commission. Nor do I think
there is any basis for concluding that individual citizens of the State will
recognize the need for and act to promote energy conservation to the extent the
government deems appropriate, if only the channels of communication are left
open. Thus, even if I were to agree that commercial speech is entitled to some
First Amendment protection, I would hold here that the State's decision to ban
promotional advertising, in light of the substantial state interest at stake, is a
constitutionally permissible exercise of its power to adopt regulations designed
to promote the interests of its citizens.
The plethora of opinions filed in this case highlights the doctrinal difficulties
that emerge from this Court's decisions granting First Amendment protection to
commercial speech. ***
Two ideas are here at war with one another, and their resolution, although it be
on a judicial battlefield, will be a very difficult one. The sort of "advocacy" of
which Mr. Justice Brandeis spoke was not the advocacy on the part of a utility
to use more of its product. Nor do I think those who won our independence,
while declining to "exalt order at the cost of liberty," would have viewed a
merchant's unfettered freedom to advertise in hawking his wares as a "liberty"
not subject to extensive regulation in light of the government's substantial
interest in attaining "order" in the economic sphere.

Robson

717

The First Amendment

*** Nor does the Court today apply the clear-and-present-danger test in
invalidating New York's ban on promotional advertising. As noted above, in
these and other contexts the Court has clearly rejected the notion that there
must be a free "marketplace of ideas."
If the complaint of those who feel the Court's opinion does not go far enough is
that the "only test of truth is its ability to get itself accepted in the marketplace
of ideas"—the test advocated by Thomas Jefferson in his first inaugural address,
and by Mr. Justice Holmes in Abrams v. United States (1919) (dissenting
opinion)—there is no reason whatsoever to limit the protection accorded
commercial speech to "truthful, nonmisleading, noncoercive" speech. If the
"commercial speech" is in fact misleading, the "marketplace of ideas" will in
time reveal that fact. It may not reveal it sufficiently soon to avoid harm to
numerous people, but if the reasoning of Brandeis and Holmes is applied in this
context, that was one of the risks we took in protecting free speech in a
democratic society.
Unfortunately, although the "marketplace of ideas" has a historically and
sensibly defined context in the world of political speech, it has virtually none in
the realm of business transactions. ***
I remain of the view that the Court unlocked a Pandora's Box when it "elevated"
commercial speech to the level of traditional political speech by according it
First Amendment protection in Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens
Consumer Council (1976). The line between "commercial speech," and the kind
of speech that those who drafted the First Amendment had in mind, may not be
a technically or intellectually easy one to draw, but it surely produced far fewer
problems than has the development of judicial doctrine in this area since
Virginia Pharmacy Board. For in the world of political advocacy and its
marketplace of ideas, there is no such thing as a "fraudulent" idea: there may
be useless proposals, totally unworkable schemes, as well as very sound
proposals that will receive the imprimatur of the "marketplace of ideas" through
our majoritarian system of election and representative government. The free
flow of information is important in this context not because it will lead to the
discovery of any objective "truth," but because it is essential to our system of
self-government.
The notion that more speech is the remedy to expose falsehood and fallacies is
wholly out of place in the commercial bazaar, where if applied logically the
remedy of one who was defrauded would be merely a statement, available upon
request, reciting the Latin maxim "caveat emptor." But since "fraudulent speech"
in this area is to be remediable under Virginia Pharmacy Board the remedy of
one defrauded is a lawsuit or an agency proceeding based on common-law
notions of fraud that are separated by a world of difference from the realm of
politics and government. What time, legal decisions, and common sense have so
widely severed, I declined to join in Virginia Pharmacy Board, and regret now to
see the Court reaping the seeds that it there sowed. For in a democracy, the
economic is subordinate to the political, a lesson that our ancestors learned
long ago, and that our descendants will undoubtedly have to relearn many
years hence.

The First Amendment

The Court concedes that the state interest in energy conservation is plainly
substantial, as is the State's concern that its rates be fair and efficient. It also
concedes that there is a direct link between the Commission's ban on
promotional advertising and the State's interest in conservation. The Court
nonetheless strikes down the ban on promotional advertising because the
Commission has failed to demonstrate, under the final part of the Court's fourpart test, that its regulation is no more extensive than necessary to serve the
State's interest. In reaching this conclusion, the Court conjures up potential
advertisements that a utility might make that conceivably would result in net
energy savings. The Court does not indicate that the New York Public Service
Commission has in fact construed its ban on "promotional" advertising to
preclude the dissemination of information that clearly would result in a net
energy savings, nor does it even suggest that the Commission has been
confronted with and rejected such an advertising proposal. The final part of the
Court's test thus leaves room for so many hypothetical "better" ways that any
ingenious lawyer will surely seize on one of them to secure the invalidation of
what the state agency actually did. ***
It is in my view inappropriate for the Court to invalidate the State's ban on
commercial advertising here, based on its speculation that in some cases the
advertising may result in a net savings in electrical energy use, and in the cases
in which it is clear a net energy savings would result from utility advertising,
the Public Service Commission would apply its ban so as to proscribe such
advertising. Even assuming that the Court's speculation is correct, I do not
think it follows that facial invalidation of the ban is the appropriate course. ***
For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the New York Court of
Appeals.

Title 39 U. S. C. § 3001(e)(2) prohibits the mailing of unsolicited advertisements
for contraceptives. The District Court held that, as applied to appellee's
mailings, the statute violates the First Amendment. We affirm.
I
Section 3001(e)(2) states that "[a]ny unsolicited advertisement of matter which
is designed, adapted, or intended for preventing conception is nonmailable
matter, shall not be carried or delivered by mail, and shall be disposed of as the
Postal Service directs . . . . As interpreted by Postal Service regulations, the
statutory provision does not apply to unsolicited advertisements in which the
mailer has no commercial interest. In addition to the civil consequences of a

Robson

The First Amendment

violation of § 3001(e)(2), 18 U. S. C. § 1461 makes it a crime knowingly to use
the mails for anything declared by § 3001(e) to be nonmailable.
Appellee Youngs Drug Products Corp. (Youngs) is engaged in the manufacture,
sale, and distribution of contraceptives. Youngs markets its products primarily
through sales to chain warehouses and wholesale distributors, who in turn sell
contraceptives to retail pharmacists, who then sell those products to individual
customers. Appellee publicizes the availability and desirability of its products by
various methods. This litigation resulted from Youngs' decision to undertake a
campaign of unsolicited mass mailings to members of the public. In conjunction
with its wholesalers and retailers, Youngs seeks to mail to the public on an
unsolicited basis three types of materials:
— multi-page, multi-item flyers promoting a large variety of products
available at a drugstore, including prophylactics;
— flyers exclusively or substantially devoted to promoting prophylactics;
— informational pamphlets discussing the desirability and availability of
prophylactics in general or Youngs' products in particular.
In 1979 the Postal Service traced to a wholesaler of Youngs' products an
allegation of an unsolicited mailing of contraceptive advertisements. The Service
warned the wholesaler that the mailing violated 39 U. S. C. § 3001(e)(2).
Subsequently, Youngs contacted the Service and furnished it with copies of
Youngs' three types of proposed mailings, stating its view that the statute could
not constitutionally restrict the mailings. The Service rejected Youngs' legal
argument and notified the company that the proposed mailings would violate
§3001(e)(2). Youngs then brought this action for declaratory and injunctive
relief in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. It claimed
that the statute, as applied to its proposed mailings, violated the First
Amendment and that Youngs and its wholesaler were refraining from
distributing the advertisements because of the Service's warning.
The District Court determined that § 3001(e)(2), by its plain language,
prohibited all three types of proposed mailings. The court then addressed the
constitutionality of the statute as applied to these mailings. Finding all three
types of materials to be commercial solicitations, the court considered the
constitutionality of the statute within the framework established by this Court
for analyzing restrictions imposed on commercial speech. The court concluded
that the statutory prohibition was more extensive than necessary to the
interests asserted by the Government, and it therefore held that the statute's
absolute ban on the three types of mailings violated the First Amendment.
Appellants brought this direct appeal and we noted probable jurisdiction.
II
Beginning with Bigelow v. Virginia (1975), this Court extended the protection of
the First Amendment to commercial speech. Nonetheless, our decisions have
recognized "the `common-sense' distinction between speech proposing a
commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to
government regulation, and other varieties of speech." Thus, we have held that
the Constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than to other
constitutionally safeguarded forms of expression. Central Hudson Gas & Electric

Robson

720

The First Amendment

Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New York (1980); Virginia Pharmacy Board v.
Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. (1976).
For example, as a general matter, "the First Amendment means that
government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its
ideas, its subject matter, or its content." With respect to noncommercial speech,
this Court has sustained content-based restrictions only in the most
extraordinary circumstances. By contrast, regulation of commercial speech
based on content is less problematic. In light of the greater potential for
deception or confusion in the context of certain advertising messages, contentbased restrictions on commercial speech may be permissible.
Because the degree of protection afforded by the First Amendment depends on
whether the activity sought to be regulated constitutes commercial or
noncommercial speech, we must first determine the proper classification of the
mailings at issue here. Appellee contends that its proposed mailings constitute
"fully protected" speech, so that § 3001(e)(2) amounts to an impermissible
content-based restriction on such expression. Appellants argue, and the District
Court held, that the proposed mailings are all commercial speech. The
application of § 3001(e)(2) to appellee's proposed mailings must be examined
carefully to ensure that speech deserving of greater constitutional protection is
not inadvertently suppressed.
Most of appellee's mailings fall within the core notion of commercial speech —
"speech which does `no more than propose a commercial transaction.' " Virginia
Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. Youngs'
informational pamphlets, however, cannot be characterized merely as proposals
to engage in commercial transactions. Their proper classification as commercial
or noncommercial speech thus presents a closer question. The mere fact that
these pamphlets are conceded to be advertisements clearly does not compel the
conclusion that they are commercial speech. See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan
(1964). Similarly, the reference to a specific product does not by itself render
the pamphlets commercial speech. Finally, the fact that Youngs has an
economic motivation for mailing the pamphlets would clearly be insufficient by
itself to turn the materials into commercial speech.
The combination of all these characteristics, however, provides strong support
for the District Court's conclusion that the informational pamphlets are
properly characterized as commercial speech. The mailings constitute
commercial speech notwithstanding the fact that they contain discussions of
important public issues such as venereal disease and family planning. We have
made clear that advertising which "links a product to a current public debate"
is not thereby entitled to the constitutional protection afforded noncommercial
speech. Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New
York. A company has the full panoply of protections available to its direct
comments on public issues, so there is no reason for providing similar
constitutional protection when such statements are made in the context of
commercial transactions. Advertisers should not be permitted to immunize false
or misleading product information from government regulation simply by
including references to public issues.

Robson

721

The First Amendment

We conclude, therefore, that all of the mailings in this case are entitled to the
qualified but nonetheless substantial protection accorded to commercial speech.
III
"The protection available for particular commercial expression turns on the
nature both of the expression and of the governmental interests served by its
regulation." Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New
York. In Central Hudson we adopted a four-part analysis for assessing the
validity of restrictions on commercial speech. First, we determine whether the
expression is constitutionally protected. For commercial speech to receive such
protection, "it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading."
Second, we ask whether the governmental interest is substantial. If so, we must
then determine whether the regulation directly advances the government
interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than necessary to serve
that interest. Applying this analysis, we conclude that § 3001(e)(2) is
unconstitutional as applied to appellee's mailings.
We turn first to the protection afforded by the First Amendment. The State may
deal effectively with false, deceptive, or misleading sales techniques. The State
may also prohibit commercial speech related to illegal behavior. In this case,
however, appellants have never claimed that Youngs' proposed mailings fall into
any of these categories. To the contrary, advertising for contraceptives not only
implicates " `substantial individual and societal interests' " in the free flow of
commercial information, but also relates to activity which is protected from
unwarranted state interference. Youngs' proposed commercial speech is
therefore clearly protected by the First Amendment. Indeed, where — as in this
case — a speaker desires to convey truthful information relevant to important
social issues such as family planning and the prevention of venereal disease, we
have previously found the First Amendment interest served by such speech
paramount.
We must next determine whether the Government's interest in prohibiting the
mailing of unsolicited contraceptive advertisements is a substantial one. The
prohibition in § 3001(e)(2) originated in 1873 as part of the Comstock Act, a
criminal statute designed "for the suppression of Trade in and Circulation of
obscene Literature and Articles of immoral Use." Act of Mar. 3, 1873, ch. 258, §
2, 17 Stat. 599. Appellants do not purport to rely on justifications for the
statute offered during the 19th century. Instead, they advance interests that
concededly were not asserted when the prohibition was enacted into law. This
reliance is permissible since the insufficiency of the original motivation does not
diminish other interests that the restriction may now serve.
In particular, appellants assert that the statute (1) shields recipients of mail
from materials that they are likely to find offensive and (2) aids parents' efforts
to control the manner in which their children become informed about sensitive
and important subjects such as birth control. The first of these interests carries
little weight. In striking down a state prohibition of contraceptive
advertisements in Carey v. Population Services International we stated that
offensiveness was "classically not [a] justificatio[n] validating the suppression of
expression protected by the First Amendment. At least where obscenity is not
involved, we have consistently held that the fact that protected speech may be
offensive to some does not justify its suppression." We specifically declined to

Robson

722

The First Amendment

recognize a distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech that
would render this interest a sufficient justification for a prohibition of
commercial speech.
Recognizing that their reliance on this interest is "problematic," appellants
attempt to avoid the clear import of Carey by emphasizing that § 3001(e)(2) is
aimed at the mailing of materials to the home. We have, of course, recognized
the important interest in allowing addressees to give notice to a mailer that they
wish no further mailings which, in their sole discretion, they believe to be
erotically arousing or sexually provocative. But we have never held that the
Government itself can shut off the flow of mailings to protect those recipients
who might potentially be offended. The First Amendment "does not permit the
government to prohibit speech as intrusive unless the `captive' audience cannot
avoid objectionable speech." Recipients of objectionable mailings, however, may
" `effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities simply by averting
their eyes.' " Consequently, the "short, though regular, journey from mail box to
trash can . . . is an acceptable burden, at least so far as the Constitution is
concerned."
The second interest asserted by appellants — aiding parents' efforts to discuss
birth control with their children — is undoubtedly substantial. "[P]arents have
an important `guiding role' to play in the upbringing of their children . . . which
presumptively includes counseling them on important decisions." As a means of
effectuating this interest, however, § 3001(e)(2) fails to withstand scrutiny.
To begin with, § 3001(e)(2) provides only the most limited incremental support
for the interest asserted. We can reasonably assume that parents already
exercise substantial control over the disposition of mail once it enters their
mailboxes. Under 39 U. S. C. § 3008, parents can also exercise control over
information that flows into their mailboxes. And parents must already cope with
the multitude of external stimuli that color their children's perception of
sensitive subjects. Under these circumstances, a ban on unsolicited
advertisements serves only to assist those parents who desire to keep their
children from confronting such mailings, who are otherwise unable to do so,
and whose children have remained relatively free from such stimuli.
This marginal degree of protection is achieved by purging all mailboxes of
unsolicited material that is entirely suitable for adults. We have previously
made clear that a restriction of this scope is more extensive than the
Constitution permits, for the government may not "reduce the adult
population . . . to reading only what is fit for children." The level of discourse
reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for
a sandbox. In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation (1978), this Court did recognize that
the Government's interest in protecting the young justified special treatment of
an afternoon broadcast heard by adults as well as children. At the same time,
the majority "emphasize[d] the narrowness of our holding," explaining that
broadcasting is "uniquely pervasive" and that it is "uniquely accessible to
children, even those too young to read." (emphasis added). The receipt of mail is
far less intrusive and uncontrollable. Our decisions have recognized that the
special interest of the Federal Government in regulation of the broadcast media
does not readily translate into a justification for regulation of other means of
communication.

Robson

723

The First Amendment

Section 3001(e)(2) is also defective because it denies to parents truthful
information bearing on their ability to discuss birth control and to make
informed decisions in this area. Because the proscribed information "may bear
on one of the most important decisions" parents have a right to make, the
restriction of "the free flow of truthful information" constitutes a "basic"
constitutional defect regardless of the strength of the government's interest.
IV
We thus conclude that the justifications offered by appellants are insufficient to
warrant the sweeping prohibition on the mailing of unsolicited contraceptive
advertisements. As applied to appellee's mailings, § 3001(e)(2) is
unconstitutional. The judgment of the District Court is therefore
Affirmed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN TOOK NO PART IN THE DECISION OF THIS CASE.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, WITH WHOM JUSTICE O'CONNOR JOINS, CONCURRING IN THE
JUDGMENT.
I agree that the judgment should be affirmed, but my reasoning differs from
that of the Court. The right to use the mails is undoubtedly protected by the
First Amendment.
But because the home mailbox has features which
distinguish it from a public hall or public park, where it may be assumed that
all who are present wish to hear the views of the particular speaker then on the
rostrum, it cannot be totally assimilated for purposes of analysis with these
traditional public forums. Several people within a family or living group may
have free access to a mailbox, including minor children; and obviously not every
piece of mail received has been either expressly or impliedly solicited. It is the
unsolicited mass mailings sent by appellee designed to promote the use of
condoms that gives rise to this litigation.
*** [ Omitted discussion and application of Central Hudson].
Thus, under this Court's cases the intrusion generated by Youngs' proposed
advertising is relatively small, and the restriction imposed by § 3001(e)(2) is
relatively large. Although this restriction directly advances weighty
governmental interests, it is somewhat more extensive than is necessary to
serve those interests. On balance I conclude that this restriction on Youngs'
commercial speech has not been adequately justified. Section 3001(e)(2)
therefore violates the First Amendment as applied to Youngs and to material of
the type Youngs has indicated that it plans to send, and I agree that the
judgment of the District Court should be affirmed.
JUSTICE STEVENS, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
Two aspects of the Court's opinion merit further comment: (1) its conclusion
that all of the communications at issue are properly classified as "commercial
speech"; and (2) its virtually complete rejection of offensiveness as a possibly
legitimate justification for the suppression of speech. My views are somewhat
different from the Court's on both of these matters. ***

JUSTICE WHITE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Since the decision in Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer
Council, Inc. (1976), in which the Court held for the first time that the First
Amendment precludes certain forms of regulation of purely commercial speech,
we have on a number of occasions addressed the constitutionality of restraints
on advertising and solicitation by attorneys. See In re R. M. J. (1982); In re
Primus (1978); Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn. (1978); Bates v. State Bar of
Arizona (1977). This case presents additional unresolved questions regarding
the regulation of commercial speech by attorneys: whether a State may
discipline an attorney for soliciting business by running newspaper
advertisements containing nondeceptive illustrations and legal advice, and
whether a State may seek to prevent potential deception of the public by
requiring attorneys to disclose in their advertising certain information regarding
fee arrangements.
I
Appellant is an attorney practicing in Columbus, Ohio. Late in 1981, he sought
to augment his practice by advertising in local newspapers. His first effort was a
modest one: he ran a small advertisement in the Columbus Citizen Journal
advising its readers that his law firm would represent defendants in drunken
driving cases and that his clients' "[f]ull legal fee [would be] refunded if [they
were] convicted of DRUNK DRIVING." The advertisement appeared in the
Journal for two days; on the second day, Charles Kettlewell, an attorney
employed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel of the Supreme Court of Ohio
(appellee) telephoned appellant and informed him that the advertisement
appeared to be an offer to represent criminal defendants on a contingent-fee
basis, a practice prohibited by Disciplinary Rule 2-106(C) of the Ohio Code of
Professional Responsibility. Appellant immediately withdrew the advertisement
and in a letter to Kettlewell apologized for running it, also stating in the letter
that he would decline to accept employment by persons responding to the ad.
Appellant's second effort was more ambitious. In the spring of 1982, appellant
placed an advertisement in 36 Ohio newspapers publicizing his willingness to
represent women who had suffered injuries resulting from their use of a
contraceptive device known as the Dalkon Shield Intrauterine Device. The

Robson

725

The First Amendment

advertisement featured a line drawing of the Dalkon Shield accompanied by the
question, "DID YOU USE THIS IUD?" The advertisement then related the
following information:
"The Dalkon Shield Interuterine [sic] Device is alleged to have caused serious
pelvic infections resulting in hospitalizations, tubal damage, infertility, and
hysterectomies. It is also alleged to have caused unplanned pregnancies ending
in abortions, miscarriages, septic abortions, tubal or ectopic pregnancies, and
full-term deliveries. If you or a friend have had a similar experience do not
assume it is too late to take legal action against the Shield's manufacturer. Our
law firm is presently representing women on such cases. The cases are handled
on a contingent fee basis of the amount recovered. If there is no recovery, no
legal fees are owed by our clients."

The ad concluded with the name of appellant's law firm, its address, and a
phone number that the reader might call for "free information."
The advertisement was successful in attracting clients: appellant received well
over 200 inquiries regarding the advertisement, and he initiated lawsuits on
behalf of 106 of the women who contacted him as a result of the advertisement.
The ad, however, also aroused the interest of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.
On July 29, 1982, the Office filed a complaint against appellant charging him
with a number of disciplinary violations arising out of both the drunken driving
and Dalkon Shield advertisements.
The complaint, as subsequently amended, alleged that the drunken driving ad
violated Ohio Disciplinary Rule 2-101(A) in that it was "false, fraudulent,
misleading, and deceptive to the public" because it offered representation on a
contingent-fee basis in a criminal case — an offer that could not be carried out
under Disciplinary Rule 2-106(C). With respect to the Dalkon Shield
advertisement, the complaint alleged that in running the ad and accepting
employment by women responding to it, appellant had violated the following
Disciplinary Rules: DR 2-101(B), which prohibits the use of illustrations in
advertisements run by attorneys, requires that ads by attorneys be "dignified,"
and limits the information that may be included in such ads to a list of 20
items;[4] DR 2-103(A), which prohibits an attorney from "recommend[ing]
employment, as a private practitioner, of himself, his partner, or associate to a
non-lawyer who has not sought his advice regarding employment of a lawyer";
and DR 2-104(A), which provides (with certain exceptions not applicable here)
that "[a] lawyer who has given unsolicited advice to a layman that he should
obtain counsel or take legal action shall not accept employment resulting from
that advice."
The complaint also alleged that the advertisement violated DR 2-101(B)(15),
which provides that any advertisement that mentions contingent-fee rates must
"disclos[e] whether percentages are computed before or after deduction of court
costs and expenses," and that the ad's failure to inform clients that they would
be liable for costs (as opposed to legal fees) even if their claims were
unsuccessful rendered the advertisement "deceptive" in violation of DR 2-101(A).
The complaint did not allege that the Dalkon Shield advertisement was false or
deceptive in any respect other than its omission of information relating to the
contingent-fee arrangement; indeed, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
stipulated that the information and advice regarding Dalkon Shield litigation

Robson

726

The First Amendment

was not false, fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive and that the drawing was an
accurate representation of the Dalkon Shield.
The charges against appellant were heard by a panel of the Board of
Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court of Ohio.
Appellant's primary defense to the charges against him was that Ohio's rules
restricting the content of advertising by attorneys were unconstitutional under
this Court's decisions in Bates v. State Bar of Arizona (1977), and In re R. M. J.
(1982). In support of his contention that the State had not provided justification
for its rules sufficient to withstand the First Amendment scrutiny called for by
those decisions, appellant proffered the testimony of expert witnesses that
unfettered advertising by attorneys was economically beneficial and that
appellant's advertising in particular was socially valuable in that it served to
inform members of the public of their legal rights and of the potential health
hazards associated with the Dalkon Shield. Appellant also put on the stand two
of the women who had responded to his advertisements, both of whom testified
that they would not have learned of their legal claims had it not been for
appellant's advertisement.
The panel found that appellant's use of advertising had violated a number of
Disciplinary Rules. The panel accepted the contention that the drunken driving
advertisement was deceptive, but its reasoning differed from that of the Office of
Disciplinary Counsel: the panel concluded that because the advertisement
failed to mention the common practice of plea bargaining in drunken driving
cases, it might be deceptive to potential clients who would be unaware of the
likelihood that they would both be found guilty (of a lesser offense) and be liable
for attorney's fees (because they had not been convicted of drunken driving).
The panel also found that the use of an illustration in appellant's Dalkon Shield
advertisement violated DR 2-101(B), that the ad's failure to disclose the client's
potential liability for costs even if her suit were unsuccessful violated both DR
2-101(A) and DR 2-101 (B)(15), that the advertisement constituted selfrecommendation in violation of DR 2-103(A), and that appellant's acceptance of
offers of employment resulting from the advertisement violated DR 2-104(A).
The panel rejected appellant's arguments that Ohio's regulations regarding the
content of attorney advertising were unconstitutional as applied to him. The
panel noted that neither Bates nor In re R. M. J. had forbidden all regulation of
attorney advertising and that both of those cases had involved advertising
regulations substantially more restrictive than Ohio's. The panel also relied
heavily on Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn. (1978), in which this Court upheld
Ohio's imposition of discipline on an attorney who had engaged in in-person
solicitation. The panel apparently concluded that the interests served by the
application of Ohio's rules to advertising that contained legal advice and
solicited clients to pursue a particular legal claim were as substantial as the
interests at stake in Ohralik. Accordingly, the panel rejected appellant's
constitutional defenses and recommended that he be publicly reprimanded for
his violations. The Board of Commissioners adopted the panel's findings in full,
but recommended the sanction of indefinite suspension from the practice of law
rather than the more lenient punishment proposed by the panel.
The Supreme Court of Ohio, in turn, adopted the Board's findings that
appellant's advertisements had violated the Disciplinary Rules specified by the

Robson

727

The First Amendment

hearing panel. The court also agreed with the Board that the application of
Ohio's rules to appellant's advertisements did not offend the First Amendment.
The court pointed out that Bates and In re R. M. J. permitted regulations
designed to prevent the use of deceptive advertising and that R. M. J. had
recognized that even non-deceptive advertising might be restricted if the
restriction was narrowly designed to achieve a substantial state interest. The
court held that disclosure requirements applicable to advertisements
mentioning contingent-fee arrangements served the permissible goal of
ensuring that potential clients were not misled regarding the terms of the
arrangements. In addition, the court held, it was "allowable" to prevent
attorneys from claiming expertise in particular fields of law in the absence of
standards by which such claims might be assessed, and it was "reasonable" to
preclude the use of illustrations in advertisements and to prevent attorneys
from offering legal advice in their advertisements, although the court did not
specifically identify the interests served by these restrictions. Having
determined that appellant's advertisements violated Ohio's Disciplinary Rules
and that the First Amendment did not forbid the application of those rules to
appellant, the court concluded that appellant's conduct warranted a public
reprimand.
Contending that Ohio's Disciplinary Rules violate the First Amendment insofar
as they authorize the State to discipline him for the content of his Dalkon
Shield advertisement, appellant filed this appeal. Appellant also claims that the
manner in which he was disciplined for running his drunken driving
advertisement violated his right to due process. We noted probable jurisdiction,
and now affirm in part and reverse in part.
II
There is no longer any room to doubt that what has come to be known as
"commercial speech" is entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, albeit
to protection somewhat less extensive than that afforded "noncommercial
speech." Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp. (1983); Central Hudson Gas &
Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New York (1980). More subject to
doubt, perhaps, are the precise bounds of the category of expression that may
be termed commercial speech, but it is clear enough that the speech at issue in
this case — advertising pure and simple — falls within those bounds. Our
commercial speech doctrine rests heavily on "the `common-sense' distinction
between speech proposing a commercial transaction . . . and other varieties of
speech," and appellant's advertisements undeniably propose a commercial
transaction. Whatever else the category of commercial speech may encompass,
it must include appellant's advertisements.
Our general approach to restrictions on commercial speech is also by now well
settled. The States and the Federal Government are free to prevent the
dissemination of commercial speech that is false, deceptive, or misleading, or
that proposes an illegal transaction. Commercial speech that is not false or
deceptive and does not concern unlawful activities, however, may be restricted
only in the service of a substantial governmental interest, and only through
means that directly advance that interest. Central Hudson Gas & Electric. Our
application of these principles to the commercial speech of attorneys has led us
to conclude that blanket bans on price advertising by attorneys and rules

Robson

728

The First Amendment

preventing attorneys from using non-deceptive terminology to describe their
fields of practice are impermissible, but that rules prohibiting in-person
solicitation of clients by attorneys are, at least under some circumstances,
permissible. To resolve this appeal, we must apply the teachings of these cases
to three separate forms of regulation Ohio has imposed on advertising by its
attorneys: prohibitions on soliciting legal business through advertisements
containing advice and information regarding specific legal problems; restrictions
on the use of illustrations in advertising by lawyers; and disclosure
requirements relating to the terms of contingent fees.
III
We turn first to the Ohio Supreme Court's finding that appellant's Dalkon
Shield advertisement (and his acceptance of employment resulting from it) ran
afoul of the rules against self-recommendation and accepting employment
resulting from unsolicited legal advice. Because all advertising is at least
implicitly a plea for its audience's custom, a broad reading of the rules applied
by the Ohio court (and particularly the rule against self-recommendation) might
suggest that they forbid all advertising by attorneys — a result obviously not in
keeping with our decisions in Bates and In re R. M. J. But the Ohio court did not
purport to give its rules such a broad reading: it held only that the rules
forbade soliciting or accepting legal employment through advertisements
containing information or advice regarding a specific legal problem.
The interest served by the application of the Ohio self-recommendation and
solicitation rules to appellant's advertisement is not apparent from a reading of
the opinions of the Ohio Supreme Court and its Board of Commissioners. The
advertisement's information and advice concerning the Dalkon Shield were, as
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel stipulated, neither false nor deceptive: in fact,
they were entirely accurate. The advertisement did not promise readers that
lawsuits alleging injuries caused by the Dalkon Shield would be successful, nor
did it suggest that appellant had any special expertise in handling such
lawsuits other than his employment in other such litigation. Rather, the
advertisement reported the indisputable fact that the Dalkon Shield has
spawned an impressive number of lawsuits and advised readers that appellant
was currently handling such lawsuits and was willing to represent other women
asserting similar claims. In addition, the advertisement advised women that
they should not assume that their claims were time-barred — advice that seems
completely unobjectionable in light of the trend in many States toward a
"discovery rule" for determining when a cause of action for latent injury or
disease accrues. The State's power to prohibit advertising that is "inherently
misleading," thus cannot justify Ohio's decision to discipline appellant for
running advertising geared to persons with a specific legal problem.
Because appellant's statements regarding the Dalkon Shield were not false or
deceptive, our decisions impose on the State the burden of establishing that
prohibiting the use of such statements to solicit or obtain legal business
directly advances a substantial governmental interest. The extensive citations in
the opinion of the Board of Commissioners to our opinion in Ohralik v. Ohio
State Bar Assn. (1978), suggest that the Board believed that the application of
the rules to appellant's advertising served the same interests that this Court
found sufficient to justify the ban on in-person solicitation at issue in Ohralik.

Robson

729

The First Amendment

We cannot agree. Our decision in Ohralik was largely grounded on the
substantial differences between face-to-face solicitation and the advertising we
had held permissible in Bates. In-person solicitation by a lawyer, we concluded,
was a practice rife with possibilities for overreaching, invasion of privacy, the
exercise of undue influence, and outright fraud. In addition, we noted that inperson solicitation presents unique regulatory difficulties because it is "not
visible or otherwise open to public scrutiny." These unique features of in-person
solicitation by lawyers, we held, justified a prophylactic rule prohibiting lawyers
from engaging in such solicitation for pecuniary gain, but we were careful to
point out that "in-person solicitation of professional employment by a lawyer
does not stand on a par with truthful advertising about the availability and
terms of routine legal services."
It is apparent that the concerns that moved the Court in Ohralik are not present
here. Although some sensitive souls may have found appellant's advertisement
in poor taste, it can hardly be said to have invaded the privacy of those who
read it. More significantly, appellant's advertisement — and print advertising
generally — poses much less risk of over-reaching or undue influence. Print
advertising may convey information and ideas more or less effectively, but in
most cases, it will lack the coercive force of the personal presence of a trained
advocate. In addition, a printed advertisement, unlike a personal encounter
initiated by an attorney, is not likely to involve pressure on the potential client
for an immediate yes-or-no answer to the offer of representation. Thus, a
printed advertisement is a means of conveying information about legal services
that is more conducive to reflection and the exercise of choice on the part of the
consumer than is personal solicitation by an attorney. Accordingly, the
substantial interests that justified the ban on in-person solicitation upheld in
Ohralik cannot justify the discipline imposed on appellant for the content of his
advertisement.
Nor does the traditional justification for restraints on solicitation — the fear
that lawyers will "stir up litigation" — justify the restriction imposed in this case.
In evaluating this proffered justification, it is important to think about what it
might mean to say that the State has an interest in preventing lawyers from
stirring up litigation. It is possible to describe litigation itself as an evil that the
State is entitled to combat: after all, litigation consumes vast quantities of social
resources to produce little of tangible value but much discord and
unpleasantness. "[A]s a litigant," Judge Learned Hand once observed, "I should
dread a lawsuit beyond almost anything else short of sickness and death." L.
Hand, The Deficiencies of Trials to Reach the Heart of the Matter, in 3
ASSOCIATION OF THE BAR OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, LECTURES ON LEGAL TOPICS 89,
105 (1926).
But we cannot endorse the proposition that a lawsuit, as such, is an evil. Over
the course of centuries, our society has settled upon civil litigation as a means
for redressing grievances, resolving disputes, and vindicating rights when other
means fail. There is no cause for consternation when a person who believes in
good faith and on the basis of accurate information regarding his legal rights
that he has suffered a legally cognizable injury turns to the courts for a remedy:
"we cannot accept the notion that it is always better for a person to suffer a
wrong silently than to redress it by legal action." Bates. That our citizens have

Robson

730

The First Amendment

access to their civil courts is not an evil to be regretted; rather, it is an attribute
of our system of justice in which we ought to take pride. The State is not
entitled to interfere with that access by denying its citizens accurate
information about their legal rights. Accordingly, it is not sufficient justification
for the discipline imposed on appellant that his truthful and nondeceptive
advertising had a tendency to or did in fact encourage others to file lawsuits.
The State does not, however, argue that the encouragement of litigation is
inherently evil, nor does it assert an interest in discouraging the particular form
of litigation that appellant's advertising solicited. Rather, the State's position is
that although appellant's advertising may itself have been harmless — may
even have had the salutary effect of informing some persons of rights of which
they would otherwise have been unaware — the State's prohibition on the use
of legal advice and information in advertising by attorneys is a prophylactic rule
that is needed to ensure that attorneys, in an effort to secure legal business for
themselves, do not use false or misleading advertising to stir up meritless
litigation against innocent defendants. Advertising by attorneys, the State
claims, presents regulatory difficulties that are different in kind from those
presented by other forms of advertising. Whereas statements about most
consumer products are subject to verification, the indeterminacy of statements
about law makes it impractical if not impossible to weed out accurate
statements from those that are false or misleading. A prophylactic rule is
therefore essential if the State is to vindicate its substantial interest in ensuring
that its citizens are not encouraged to engage in litigation by statements that
are at best ambiguous and at worst outright false.
The State's argument that it may apply a prophylactic rule to punish appellant
notwithstanding that his particular advertisement has none of the vices that
allegedly justify the rule is in tension with our insistence that restrictions
involving commercial speech that is not itself deceptive be narrowly crafted to
serve the State's purposes. ***
We need not, however, address the theoretical question whether a prophylactic
rule is ever permissible in this area, for we do not believe that the State has
presented a convincing case for its argument that the rule before us is
necessary to the achievement of a substantial governmental interest. The
State's contention that the problem of distinguishing deceptive and
nondeceptive legal advertising is different in kind from the problems presented
by advertising generally is unpersuasive.
The State's argument proceeds from the premise that it is intrinsically difficult
to distinguish advertisements containing legal advice that is false or deceptive
from those that are truthful and helpful, much more so than is the case with
other goods or services. This notion is belied by the facts before us: appellant's
statements regarding Dalkon Shield litigation were in fact easily verifiable and
completely accurate. Nor is it true that distinguishing deceptive from
nondeceptive claims in advertising involving products other than legal services
is a comparatively simple and straightforward process. A brief survey of the
body of case law that has developed as a result of the Federal Trade
Commission's efforts to carry out its mandate under § 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act to eliminate "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in . . .
commerce," 15 U. S. C. § 45(a)(1), reveals that distinguishing deceptive from

Robson

731

The First Amendment

nondeceptive advertising in virtually any field of commerce may require
resolution of exceedingly complex and technical factual issues and the
consideration of nice questions of semantics. In short, assessment of the
validity of legal advice and information contained in attorneys' advertising is not
necessarily a matter of great complexity; nor is assessing the accuracy or
capacity to deceive of other forms of advertising the simple process the State
makes it out to be. The qualitative distinction the State has attempted to draw
eludes us.
Were we to accept the State's argument in this case, we would have little basis
for preventing the government from suppressing other forms of truthful and
nondeceptive advertising simply to spare itself the trouble of distinguishing
such advertising from false or deceptive advertising. The First Amendment
protections afforded commercial speech would mean little indeed if such
arguments were allowed to prevail. Our recent decisions involving commercial
speech have been grounded in the faith that the free flow of commercial
information is valuable enough to justify imposing on would-be regulators the
costs of distinguishing the truthful from the false, the helpful from the
misleading, and the harmless from the harmful. The value of the information
presented in appellant's advertising is no less than that contained in other
forms of advertising — indeed, insofar as appellant's advertising tended to
acquaint persons with their legal rights who might otherwise be shut off from
effective access to the legal system, it was undoubtedly more valuable than
many other forms of advertising. Prophylactic restraints that would be
unacceptable as applied to commercial advertising generally are therefore
equally unacceptable as applied to appellant's advertising. An attorney may not
be disciplined for soliciting legal business through printed advertising
containing truthful and nondeceptive information and advice regarding the legal
rights of potential clients.
IV
The application of DR 2-101(B)'s restriction on illustrations in advertising by
lawyers to appellant's advertisement fails for much the same reasons as does
the application of the self-recommendation and solicitation rules. The use of
illustrations or pictures in advertisements serves important communicative
functions: it attracts the attention of the audience to the advertiser's message,
and it may also serve to impart information directly. Accordingly, commercial
illustrations are entitled to the First Amendment protections afforded verbal
commercial speech: restrictions on the use of visual media of expression in
advertising must survive scrutiny under the Central Hudson test. Because the
illustration for which appellant was disciplined is an accurate representation of
the Dalkon Shield and has no features that are likely to deceive, mislead, or
confuse the reader, the burden is on the State to present a substantial
governmental interest justifying the restriction as applied to appellant and to
demonstrate that the restriction vindicates that interest through the least
restrictive available means.
The text of DR 2-101(B) strongly suggests that the purpose of the restriction on
the use of illustrations is to ensure that attorneys advertise "in a dignified
manner." There is, of course, no suggestion that the illustration actually used
by appellant was undignified; thus, it is difficult to see how the application of

Robson

732

The First Amendment

the rule to appellant in this case directly advances the State's interest in
preserving the dignity of attorneys. More fundamentally, although the State
undoubtedly has a substantial interest in ensuring that its attorneys behave
with dignity and decorum in the courtroom, we are unsure that the State's
desire that attorneys maintain their dignity in their communications with the
public is an interest substantial enough to justify the abridgment of their First
Amendment rights. Even if that were the case, we are unpersuaded that
undignified behavior would tend to recur so often as to warrant a prophylactic
rule. As we held in Carey v. Population Services International (1977), the mere
possibility that some members of the population might find advertising
embarrassing or offensive cannot justify suppressing it. The same must hold
true for advertising that some members of the bar might find beneath their
dignity.
In its arguments before this Court, the State has asserted that the restriction
on illustrations serves a somewhat different purpose, akin to that supposedly
served by the prohibition on the offering of legal advice in advertising. The use
of illustrations in advertising by attorneys, the State suggests, creates
unacceptable risks that the public will be misled, manipulated, or confused.
Abuses associated with the visual content of advertising are particularly
difficult to police, because the advertiser is skilled in subtle uses of illustrations
to play on the emotions of his audience and convey false impressions. Because
illustrations may produce their effects by operating on a subconscious level, the
State argues, it will be difficult for the State to point to any particular
illustration and prove that it is misleading or manipulative. Thus, once again,
the State's argument is that its purposes can only be served through a
prophylactic rule.
We are not convinced. The State's arguments amount to little more than
unsupported assertions: nowhere does the State cite any evidence or authority
of any kind for its contention that the potential abuses associated with the use
of illustrations in attorneys' advertising cannot be combated by any means
short of a blanket ban. Moreover, none of the State's arguments establish that
there are particular evils associated with the use of illustrations in attorneys'
advertisements. Indeed, because it is probably rare that decisions regarding
consumption of legal services are based on a consumer's assumptions about
qualities of the product that can be represented visually, illustrations in lawyers’
advertisements will probably be less likely to lend themselves to material
misrepresentations than illustrations in other forms of advertising.
Thus, acceptance of the State's argument would be tantamount to adoption of
the principle that a State may prohibit the use of pictures or illustrations in
connection with advertising of any product or service simply on the strength of
the general argument that the visual content of advertisements may, under
some circumstances, be deceptive or manipulative. But as we stated above,
broad prophylactic rules may not be so lightly justified if the protections
afforded commercial speech are to retain their force. We are not persuaded that
identifying deceptive or manipulative uses of visual media in advertising is so
intrinsically burden-some that the State is entitled to forgo that task in favor of
the more convenient but far more restrictive alternative of a blanket ban on the
use of illustrations. The experience of the FTC is, again, instructive. Although

Robson

733

The First Amendment

that agency has not found the elimination of deceptive uses of visual media in
advertising to be a simple task, neither has it found the task an impossible one:
in many instances, the agency has succeeded in identifying and suppressing
visually deceptive advertising. Given the possibility of policing the use of
illustrations in advertisements on a case-by-case basis, the prophylactic
approach taken by Ohio cannot stand; hence, appellant may not be disciplined
for his use of an accurate and nondeceptive illustration.
V
Appellant contends that assessing the validity of the Ohio Supreme Court's
decision to discipline him for his failure to include in the Dalkon Shield
advertisement the information that clients might be liable for significant
litigation costs even if their lawsuits were unsuccessful entails precisely the
same inquiry as determining the validity of the restrictions on advertising
content discussed above. In other words, he suggests that the State must
establish either that the advertisement, absent the required disclosure, would
be false or deceptive or that the disclosure requirement serves some substantial
governmental interest other than preventing deception; moreover, he contends
that the State must establish that the disclosure requirement directly advances
the relevant governmental interest and that it constitutes the least restrictive
means of doing so. Not surprisingly, appellant claims that the State has failed
to muster substantial evidentiary support for any of the findings required to
support the restriction.
Appellant, however, overlooks material differences between disclosure
requirements and outright prohibitions on speech. In requiring attorneys who
advertise their willingness to represent clients on a contingent-fee basis to state
that the client may have to bear certain expenses even if he loses, Ohio has not
attempted to prevent attorneys from conveying information to the public; it has
only required them to provide somewhat more information than they might
otherwise be inclined to present. We have, to be sure, held that in some
instances compulsion to speak may be as violative of the First Amendment as
prohibitions on speech. See, e.g., Wooley v. Maynard (1977); Miami Herald
Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974). Indeed, in West Virginia State Bd. of Ed. v.
Barnette (1943), the Court went so far as to state that "involuntary affirmation
could be commanded only on even more immediate and urgent grounds than
silence."
But the interests at stake in this case are not of the same order as those
discussed in Wooley, Tornillo, and Barnette. Ohio has not attempted to
"prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other
matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein."
The State has attempted only to prescribe what shall be orthodox in commercial
advertising, and its prescription has taken the form of a requirement that
appellant include in his advertising purely factual and uncontroversial
information about the terms under which his services will be available. Because
the extension of First Amendment protection to commercial speech is justified
principally by the value to consumers of the information such speech provides,
appellant's constitutionally protected interest in not providing any particular
factual information in his advertising is minimal. Thus, in virtually all our
commercial speech decisions to date, we have emphasized that because

Robson

734

The First Amendment

disclosure requirements trench much more narrowly on an advertiser's
interests than do flat prohibitions on speech, "warning[s] or disclaimer[s] might
be appropriately required . . . in order to dissipate the possibility of consumer
confusion or deception."
We do not suggest that disclosure requirements do not implicate the
advertiser's First Amendment rights at all. We recognize that unjustified or
unduly burdensome disclosure requirements might offend the First Amendment
by chilling protected commercial speech. But we hold that an advertiser's rights
are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably
related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers.
The State's application to appellant of the requirement that an attorney
advertising his availability on a contingent-fee basis disclose that clients will
have to pay costs even if their lawsuits are unsuccessful (assuming that to be
the case) easily passes muster under this standard. Appellant's advertisement
informed the public that "if there is no recovery, no legal fees are owed by our
clients." The advertisement makes no mention of the distinction between "legal
fees" and "costs," and to a layman not aware of the meaning of these terms of
art, the advertisement would suggest that employing appellant would be a nolose proposition in that his representation in a losing cause would come entirely
free of charge. The assumption that substantial numbers of potential clients
would be so misled is hardly a speculative one: it is a commonplace that
members of the public are often unaware of the technical meanings of such
terms as "fees" and "costs" — terms that, in ordinary usage, might well be
virtually interchangeable. When the possibility of deception is as self-evident as
it is in this case, we need not require the State to "conduct a survey of the . . .
public before it [may] determine that the [advertisement] had a tendency to
mislead." FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co. The State's position that it is deceptive to
employ advertising that refers to contingent-fee arrangements without
mentioning the client's liability for costs is reasonable enough to support a
requirement that information regarding the client's liability for costs be
disclosed.
VI
Finally, we address appellant's argument that he was denied procedural due
process by the manner in which discipline was imposed on him in connection
with his drunken driving advertisement. ***
VII
The Supreme Court of Ohio issued a public reprimand incorporating by
reference its opinion finding that appellant had violated Disciplinary Rules 2101(A), 2-101(B), 2-101 (B)(15), 2-103(A), and 2-104(A). That judgment is
affirmed to the extent that it is based on appellant's advertisement involving his
terms of representation in drunken driving cases and on the omission of
information regarding his contingent-fee arrangements in his Dalkon Shield
advertisement. But insofar as the reprimand was based on appellant's use of an
illustration in his advertisement in violation of DR 2-101(B) and his offer of legal
advice in his advertisement in violation of DR 2-103(A) and 2-104(A), the
judgment is reversed.
It is so ordered.

JUSTICE POWELL TOOK NO PART IN THE DECISION OF THIS CASE.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE MARSHALL JOINS, CONCURRING IN PART,
CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT IN PART, AND DISSENTING IN PART.
I fully agree with the Court that a State may not discipline attorneys who solicit
business by publishing newspaper advertisements that contain "truthful and
nondeceptive information and advice regarding the legal rights of potential
clients" and "accurate and nondeceptive illustration[s]." I therefore join Part I-IV
of the Court's opinion, and I join the Court's judgment set forth in Part VII to
the extent it reverses the Supreme Court of Ohio's public reprimand of the
appellant Philip Q. Zauderer for his violations of Disciplinary Rules 2-101(B), 2103(A), and 2-104(A).
With some qualifications, I also agree with the conclusion in Part V of the
Court's opinion that a State may impose commercial-advertising disclosure
requirements that are "reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing
deception of consumers." I do not agree, however, that the State of Ohio's
vaguely expressed disclosure requirements fully satisfy this standard, and in
any event I believe that Ohio's punishment of Zauderer for his alleged
infractions of those requirements violated important due process and First
Amendment guarantees. In addition, I believe the manner in which Ohio has
punished Zauderer for publishing the "drunk driving" advertisement violated
fundamental principles of procedural due process. I therefore concur in part
and dissent in part from Part V of the Court's opinion, dissent from Part VI, and
dissent from the judgment set forth in Part VII insofar as it affirms the Supreme
Court of Ohio's public reprimand "based on appellant's advertisement involving
his terms of representation in drunken driving cases and on the omission of
information regarding his contingent-fee arrangements in his Dalkon Shield
advertisement."
I
A
The Court concludes that the First Amendment's protection of commercial
speech is satisfied so long as a disclosure requirement is "reasonably related" to
preventing consumer deception, and it suggests that this standard "might" be
violated if a disclosure requirement were "unjustified" or "unduly burdensome."
I agree with the Court's somewhat amorphous "reasonable relationship" inquiry
only on the understanding that it comports with the standards more precisely
set forth in our previous commercial-speech cases. Under those standards,
regulation of commercial speech — whether through an affirmative disclosure
requirement or through outright suppression — is "reasonable" only to the
extent that a State can demonstrate a legitimate and substantial interest to be
achieved by the regulation. Moreover, the regulation must directly advance the
state interest and "may extend only as far as the interest it serves." Where the
State imposes regulations to guard against "the potential for deception and
confusion" in commercial speech, those regulations "may be no broader than
reasonably necessary to prevent the deception."
Because of the First Amendment values at stake, courts must exercise careful
scrutiny in applying these standards. Thus a State may not rely on "highly

Robson

736

The First Amendment

speculative" or "tenuous" arguments in carrying its burden of demonstrating
the legitimacy of its commercial-speech regulations. Where a regulation is
addressed to allegedly deceptive advertising, the State must instead
demonstrate that the advertising either "is inherently likely to deceive" or must
muster record evidence showing that "a particular form or method of
advertising has in fact been deceptive," and it must similarly demonstrate that
the regulations directly and proportionately remedy the deception. Where States
have failed to make such showings, we have repeatedly struck down the
challenged regulations.
As the Court acknowledges, it is "somewhat difficult" to apply these standards
to Ohio's disclosure requirements "in light of the Ohio court's failure to specify
precisely what disclosures were required." It is also somewhat difficult to
determine precisely what disclosure requirements the Court approves today.
The Supreme Court of Ohio appears to have imposed three overlapping
requirements, each of which must be analyzed under the First Amendment
standards set forth above. First, the court concluded that "a lawyer
advertisement which refers to contingent fees" should indicate whether
"additional costs . . . might be assessed the client." The report of the Board of
Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Ohio Supreme Court
explained that such a requirement is necessary to guard against "the
impression that if there were no recovery, the client would owe nothing." I agree
with the Court's conclusion that, given the general public's unfamiliarity with
the distinction between fees and costs, a State may require an advertising
attorney to include a costs disclaimer so as to avoid the potential for
misunderstanding — provided the required disclaimer is "no broader than
reasonably necessary to prevent the deception."
Second, the report and opinion provide that an attorney advertising his
availability on a contingent-fee basis must "specifically expres[s]" his rates. The
Court's analysis of this requirement — which the Court characterizes as a
"suggest[ion]"— is limited to the passing observation that the requirement does
not "see[m] intrinsically burdensome." The question of burden, however, is
irrelevant unless the State can first demonstrate that the rate-publication
requirement directly and proportionately furthers a "substantial interest." Yet
an attorney's failure to specify a particular percentage rate when advertising
that he accepts cases on a contingent-fee basis can in no way be said to be
"inherently likely to deceive," and the voluminous record in this case fails to
reveal a single instance suggesting that such a failure has in actual experience
proved deceptive. Nor has Ohio at any point identified any other "substantial
interest" that would be served by such a requirement. Although a State might
well be able to demonstrate that rate publication is necessary to prevent
deception or to serve some other substantial interest, it must do so pursuant to
the carefully structured commercial-speech standards in order to ensure the
full evaluation of competing considerations and to guard against impermissible
discrimination among different categories of commercial speech. Ohio has made
no such demonstration here.
Third, the Supreme Court of Ohio agreed with the Board of Commissioners that
Zauderer had acted unethically "by failing fully to disclose the terms of the
contingent fee arrangement which was intended to be entered into at the time of

Robson

737

The First Amendment

publishing the advertisement." The record indicates that Zauderer enters into a
comprehensive contract with personal injury clients, one that spells out over
several pages the various terms and qualifications of the contingent-fee
relationship. If Ohio seriously means to require Zauderer "fully to disclose
the[se] terms," this requirement would obviously be so "unduly burdensome" as
to violate the First Amendment. Such a requirement, compelling the publication
of detailed fee information that would fill far more space than the advertisement
itself, would chill the publication of protected commercial speech and would be
entirely out of proportion to the State's legitimate interest in preventing
potential deception. Given the Court's explicit endorsement of Ohio's other
disclosure provisions, I can only read the Court's telling silence respecting this
apparent requirement as an implicit acknowledgment that it could not possibly
pass constitutional muster.
***
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND JUSTICE REHNQUIST JOIN,
CONCURRING IN PART, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT IN PART, AND DISSENTING IN PART.
I join Parts I, II, V, and VI of the Court's opinion, and its judgment except
insofar as it reverses the reprimand based on appellant Zauderer's use of
unsolicited legal advice in violation of DR 2-103(A) and 2-104(A). I agree that
appellant was properly reprimanded for his drunken driving advertisement and
for his omission of contingent fee information from his Dalkon Shield
advertisement. I also concur in the Court's judgment in Part IV. At least in the
context of print media, the task of monitoring illustrations in attorney
advertisements is not so unmanageable as to justify Ohio's blanket ban. I
dissent from Part III of the Court's opinion. In my view, the use of unsolicited
legal advice to entice clients poses enough of a risk of overreaching and undue
influence to warrant Ohio's rule. ***
*** Given the availability of alternative means to inform the public of legal rights,
Ohio's rule against legal advice in advertisements is an appropriate means to
assure the exercise of independent professional judgment by attorneys. A State
might rightfully take pride that its citizens have access to its civil courts, while
at the same time opposing the use of self-interested legal advice to solicit clients.
In the face of these substantial and legitimate state concerns, I cannot agree
with the majority that Ohio DR 2-104(A) is unnecessary to the achievement of
those interests. The Ohio rule may sweep in some advertisements containing
helpful legal advice within its general prohibition. Nevertheless, I am not
prepared to second-guess Ohio's longstanding and careful balancing of
legitimate state interests merely because appellant here can invent a less
restrictive rule. *** Because I would defer to the judgment of the States that
have chosen to preclude use of unsolicited legal advice to entice clients, I
respectfully dissent from Part III of the Court's opinion.

THOMAS, AND BREYER, JJ., JOINED. KENNEDY, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH
STEVENS, SOUTER, AND GINSBURG, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Rules of the Florida Bar prohibit personal injury lawyers from sending targeted
direct-mail solicitations to victims and their relatives for 30 days following an
accident or disaster. This case asks us to consider whether such Rules violate
the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. We hold that in the
circumstances presented here, they do not.
I
In 1989, the Florida Bar (Bar) completed a 2-year study of the effects of lawyer
advertising on public opinion. After conducting hearings, commissioning
surveys, and reviewing extensive public commentary, the Bar determined that
several changes to its advertising rules were in order. In late 1990, the Florida
Supreme Court adopted the Bar's proposed amendments with some
modifications. Two of these amendments are at issue in this case. Rule 47.4(b)(1) provides that "[a] lawyer shall not send, or knowingly permit to be
sent, . . . a written communication to a prospective client for the purpose of
obtaining professional employment if: (A) the written communication concerns
an action for personal injury or wrongful death or otherwise relates to an
accident or disaster involving the person to whom the communication is
addressed or a relative of that person, unless the accident or disaster occurred
more than 30 days prior to the mailing of the communication." Rule 4-7.8(a)
states that "[a] lawyer shall not accept referrals from a lawyer referral service
unless the service: (1) engages in no communication with the public and in no
direct contact with prospective clients in a manner that would violate the Rules
of Professional Conduct if the communication or contact were made by the
lawyer." Together, these Rules create a brief 30-day blackout period after an
accident during which lawyers may not, directly or indirectly, single out
accident victims or their relatives in order to solicit their business.
In March 1992, G. Stewart McHenry and his wholly owned lawyer referral
service, Went For It, Inc., filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief in
the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida challenging
Rules 4-7.4(b)(1) and 4-7.8(a) as violative of the First and Fourteenth
Amendments to the Constitution. McHenry alleged that he routinely sent
targeted solicitations to accident victims or their survivors within 30 days after
accidents and that he wished to continue doing so in the future. Went For It,
Inc., represented that it wished to contact accident victims or their survivors
within 30 days of accidents and to refer potential clients to participating Florida
lawyers. In October 1992, McHenry was disbarred for reasons unrelated to this
suit. Another Florida lawyer, John T. Blakely, was substituted in his stead.
The District Court referred the parties' competing summary judgment motions
to a Magistrate Judge, who concluded that the Bar had substantial government

Robson

739

The First Amendment

interests, predicated on a concern for professionalism, both in protecting the
personal privacy and tranquility of recent accident victims and their relatives
and in ensuring that these individuals do not fall prey to undue influence or
overreaching. Citing the Bar's extensive study, the Magistrate Judge found that
the Rules directly serve those interests and sweep no further than reasonably
necessary. The Magistrate recommended that the District Court grant the Bar's
motion for summary judgment on the ground that the Rules pass constitutional
muster.
The District Court rejected the Magistrate Judge's report and recommendations
and entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs, relying on Bates v. State Bar
of Ariz. (1977), and subsequent cases. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed on similar
grounds. The panel noted, in its conclusion, that it was "disturbed that Bates
and its progeny require the decision" that it reached. We granted certiorari and
now reverse.
II
A
Constitutional protection for attorney advertising, and for commercial speech
generally, is of recent vintage. Until the mid-1970's, we adhered to the broad
rule laid out in Valentine v. Chrestensen (1942), that, while the First
Amendment guards against government restriction of speech in most contexts,
"the Constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely
commercial advertising." In 1976, the Court changed course. In Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., we invalidated a state
statute barring pharmacists from advertising prescription drug prices. ***
In Bates v. State Bar of Arizona the Court struck a ban on price advertising for
what it deemed "routine" legal services: "the uncontested divorce, the simple
adoption, the uncontested personal bankruptcy, the change of name, and the
like." Expressing confidence that legal advertising would only be practicable for
such simple, standardized services, the Court rejected the State's proffered
justifications for regulation.
Nearly two decades of cases have built upon the foundation laid by Bates. It is
now well established that lawyer advertising is commercial speech and, as such,
is accorded a measure of First Amendment protection. Such First Amendment
protection, of course, is not absolute. We have always been careful to
distinguish commercial speech from speech at the First Amendment's core.
"`[C]ommercial speech [enjoys] a limited measure of protection, commensurate
with its subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values,' and is
subject to `modes of regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of
noncommercial expression.' "***
Mindful of these concerns, we engage in "intermediate" scrutiny of restrictions
on commercial speech, analyzing them under the framework set forth in Central
Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y. (1980). Under Central
Hudson, the government may freely regulate commercial speech that concerns
unlawful activity or is misleading. Commercial speech that falls into neither of
those categories, like the advertising at issue here, may be regulated if the
government satisfies a test consisting of three related prongs: First, the
government must assert a substantial interest in support of its regulation;

Robson

740

The First Amendment

second, the government must demonstrate that the restriction on commercial
speech directly and materially advances that interest; and third, the regulation
must be "`narrowly drawn.' "
B
"Unlike rational basis review, the Central Hudson standard does not permit us
to supplant the precise interests put forward by the State with other
suppositions." The Bar asserts that it has a substantial interest in protecting
the privacy and tranquility of personal injury victims and their loved ones
against intrusive, unsolicited contact by lawyers. This interest obviously factors
into the Bar's paramount (and repeatedly professed) objective of curbing
activities that "negatively affec[t] the administration of justice." Because directmail solicitations in the wake of accidents are perceived by the public as
intrusive, the Bar argues, the reputation of the legal profession in the eyes of
Floridians has suffered commensurately. The regulation, then, is an effort to
protect the flagging reputations of Florida lawyers by preventing them from
engaging in conduct that, the Bar maintains, "`is universally regarded as
deplorable and beneath common decency because of its intrusion upon the
special vulnerability and private grief of victims or their families.' "
We have little trouble crediting the Bar's interest as substantial. On various
occasions we have accepted the proposition that "States have a compelling
interest in the practice of professions within their boundaries, and . . . as part
of their power to protect the public health, safety, and other valid interests they
have broad power to establish standards for licensing practitioners and
regulating the practice of professions." Our precedents also leave no room for
doubt that "the protection of potential clients' privacy is a substantial state
interest." In other contexts, we have consistently recognized that "[t]he State's
interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, and privacy of the home is
certainly of the highest order in a free and civilized society." Indeed, we have
noted that "a special benefit of the privacy all citizens enjoy within their own
walls, which the State may legislate to protect, is an ability to avoid intrusions."
Under Central Hudson’s second prong, the State must demonstrate that the
challenged regulation "advances the Government's interest `in a direct and
material way.' " *** In Edenfield [ v. Fane (1993)], the Court invalidated a Florida
ban on in-person solicitation by certified public accountants (CPA's). We
observed that the State Board of Accountancy had "present[ed] no studies that
suggest personal solicitation of prospective business clients by CPA's creates
the dangers of fraud, overreaching, or compromised independence that the
Board claims to fear." Moreover, "[t]he record [did] not disclose any anecdotal
evidence, either from Florida or another State, that validate[d] the Board's
suppositions." In fact, we concluded that the only evidence in the record tended
to "contradic[t], rather than strengthe[n], the Board's submissions." Finding
nothing in the record to substantiate the State's allegations of harm, we
invalidated the regulation.
The direct-mail solicitation regulation before us does not suffer from such
infirmities. The Bar submitted a 106 page summary of its 2-year study of
lawyer advertising and solicitation to the District Court. That summary
contains data—both statistical and anecdotal—supporting the Bar's contentions
that the Florida public views direct-mail solicitations in the immediate wake of

Robson

741

The First Amendment

accidents as an intrusion on privacy that reflects poorly upon the profession. As
of June 1989, lawyers mailed 700,000 direct solicitations in Florida annually,
40% of which were aimed at accident victims or their survivors. A survey of
Florida adults commissioned by the Bar indicated that Floridians "have negative
feelings about those attorneys who use direct mail advertising." Fifty-four
percent of the general population surveyed said that contacting persons
concerning accidents or similar events is a violation of privacy. A random
sampling of persons who received direct-mail advertising from lawyers in 1987
revealed that 45% believed that directmail solicitation is "designed to take
advantage of gullible or unstable people"; 34% found such tactics "annoying or
irritating"; 26% found it "an invasion of your privacy"; and 24% reported that it
"made you angry." Significantly, 27% of direct-mail recipients reported that
their regard for the legal profession and for the judicial process as a whole was
"lower" as a result of receiving the direct mail.
The anecdotal record mustered by the Bar is noteworthy for its breadth and
detail. With titles like "Scavenger Lawyers" (The Miami Herald, Sept. 29, 1987)
and "Solicitors Out of Bounds" (St. Petersburg Times, Oct. 26, 1987),
newspaper editorial pages in Florida have burgeoned with criticism of Florida
lawyers who send targeted direct mail to victims shortly after accidents. The
study summary also includes page upon page of excerpts from complaints of
direct-mail recipients. For example, a Florida citizen described how he was
"`appalled and angered by the brazen attempt' " of a law firm to solicit him by
letter shortly after he was injured and his fiancee was killed in an auto accident.
Another found it "`despicable and inexcusable' " that a Pensacola lawyer wrote
to his mother three days after his father's funeral. Another described how she
was "`astounded' " and then "`very angry' " when she received a solicitation
following a minor accident. Still another described as "`beyond comprehension' "
a letter his nephew's family received the day of the nephew's funeral. One
citizen wrote, "`I consider the unsolicited contact from you after my child's
accident to be of the rankest form of ambulance chasing and in incredibly poor
taste. . . . I cannot begin to express with my limited vocabulary the utter
contempt in which I hold you and your kind.' "
In light of this showing—which respondents at no time refuted, save by the
conclusory assertion that the Rule lacked "any factual basis," we conclude that
the Bar has satisfied the second prong of the Central Hudson test. *** [W]e do
not read our case law to require that empirical data come to us accompanied by
a surfeit of background information. Indeed, in other First Amendment contexts,
we have permitted litigants to justify speech restrictions by reference to studies
and anecdotes pertaining to different locales altogether, see Renton v. Playtime
Theatres, Inc. (1986); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. (1991) (Souter, J., concurring
in judgment), or even, in a case applying strict scrutiny, to justify restrictions
based solely on history, consensus, and "simple common sense," Burson v.
Freeman (1992). Nothing in Edenfield, a case in which the State offered no
evidence or anecdotes in support of its restriction, requires more. After scouring
the record, we are satisfied that the ban on directmail solicitation in the
immediate aftermath of accidents, unlike the rule at issue in Edenfield, targets
a concrete, nonspeculative harm. ***

Robson

742

The First Amendment

Passing to Central Hudson `s third prong, we examine the relationship between
the Bar's interests and the means chosen to serve them. See Board of Trustees
of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox. With respect to this prong, the differences between
commercial speech and noncommercial speech are manifest. In Fox, we made
clear that the "least restrictive means" test has no role in the commercial
speech context. "What our decisions require," instead, "is a ‘fit’ between the
legislature's ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,' a fit that is
not necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the
single best disposition but one whose scope is `in proportion to the interest
served,' that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but . . . a
means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective." Of course, we do not
equate this test with the less rigorous obstacles of rational basis review; in
Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc. (1993), for example, we observed that the
existence of "numerous and obvious less-burdensome alternatives to the
restriction on commercial speech . . . is certainly a relevant consideration in
determining whether the `fit' between ends and means is reasonable."
Respondents levy a great deal of criticism, echoed in the dissent, at the scope of
the Bar's restriction on targeted mail. "[B]y prohibiting written communications
to all people, whatever their state of mind," respondents charge, the Rule "keeps
useful information from those accident victims who are ready, willing and able
to utilize a lawyer's advice." This criticism may be parsed into two components.
First, the Rule does not distinguish between victims in terms of the severity of
their injuries. According to respondents, the Rule is unconstitutionally
overinclusive insofar as it bans targeted mailings even to citizens whose injuries
or grief are relatively minor. Second, the Rule may prevent citizens from
learning about their legal options, particularly at a time when other actors—
opposing counsel and insurance adjusters—may be clamoring for victims'
attentions. Any benefit arising from the Bar's regulation, respondents implicitly
contend, is outweighed by these costs.
We are not persuaded by respondents' allegations of constitutional infirmity. We
find little deficiency in the ban's failure to distinguish among injured Floridians
by the severity of their pain or the intensity of their grief. Indeed, it is hard to
imagine the contours of a regulation that might satisfy respondents on this
score. Rather than drawing difficult lines on the basis that some injuries are
"severe" and some situations appropriate (and others, presumably,
inappropriate) for grief, anger, or emotion, the Bar has crafted a ban applicable
to all postaccident or disaster solicitations for a brief 30-day period. Unlike
respondents, we do not see "numerous and obvious less-burdensome
alternatives" to Florida's short temporal ban. The Bar's rule is reasonably well
tailored to its stated objective of eliminating targeted mailings whose type and
timing are a source of distress to Floridians, distress that has caused many of
them to lose respect for the legal profession.
Respondents' second point would have force if the Bar's Rule were not limited to
a brief period and if there were not many other ways for injured Floridians to
learn about the availability of legal representation during that time. Our lawyer
advertising cases have afforded lawyers a great deal of leeway to devise
innovative ways to attract new business. Florida permits lawyers to advertise on
prime-time television and radio as well as in newspapers and other media. They

Robson

743

The First Amendment

may rent space on billboards. They may send untargeted letters to the general
population, or to discrete segments thereof. There are, of course, pages upon
pages devoted to lawyers in the Yellow Pages of Florida telephone directories.
These listings are organized alphabetically and by area of specialty. These
ample alternative channels for receipt of information about the availability of
legal representation during the 30-day period following accidents may explain
why, despite the ample evidence, testimony, and commentary submitted by
those favoring (as well as opposing) unrestricted direct-mail solicitation,
respondents have not pointed to—and we have not independently found—a
single example of an individual case in which immediate solicitation helped to
avoid, or failure to solicit within 30 days brought about, the harms that concern
the dissent. In fact, the record contains considerable empirical survey
information suggesting that Floridians have little difficulty finding a lawyer
when they need one. Finding no basis to question the commonsense conclusion
that the many alternative channels for communicating necessary information
about attorneys are sufficient, we see no defect in Florida's regulation.
III
Speech by professionals obviously has many dimensions. There are
circumstances in which we will accord speech by attorneys on public issues
and matters of legal representation the strongest protection our Constitution
has to offer. See, e. g., Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada (1991); In re Primus (1978).
This case, however, concerns pure commercial advertising, for which we have
always reserved a lesser degree of protection under the First Amendment.
Particularly because the standards and conduct of state-licensed lawyers have
traditionally been subject to extensive regulation by the States, it is all the more
appropriate that we limit our scrutiny of state regulations to a level
commensurate with the "`subordinate position' " of commercial speech in the
scale of First Amendment values.
We believe that the Bar's 30-day restriction on targeted direct-mail solicitation
of accident victims and their relatives withstands scrutiny under the threepronged Central Hudson test that we have devised for this context. The Bar has
substantial interest both in protecting injured Floridians from invasive conduct
by lawyers and in preventing the erosion of confidence in the profession that
such repeated invasions have engendered. The Bar's proffered study,
unrebutted by respondents below, provides evidence indicating that the harms
it targets are far from illusory. The palliative devised by the Bar to address
these harms is narrow both in scope and in duration. The Constitution, in our
view, requires nothing more.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is
Reversed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, AND JUSTICE
GINSBURG JOIN, DISSENTING.
Attorneys who communicate their willingness to assist potential clients are
engaged in speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. That
principle has been understood since Bates v. State Bar of Ariz. (1977). The

Robson

744

The First Amendment

Court today undercuts this guarantee in an important class of cases and
unsettles leading First Amendment precedents, at the expense of those victims
most in need of legal assistance. With all respect for the Court, in my view its
solicitude for the privacy of victims and its concern for our profession are
misplaced and self-defeating, even upon the Court's own premises.
I take it to be uncontroverted that when an accident results in death or injury,
it is often urgent at once to investigate the occurrence, identify witnesses, and
preserve evidence. Vital interests in speech and expression are, therefore, at
stake when by law an attorney cannot direct a letter to the victim or the family
explaining this simple fact and offering competent legal assistance. Meanwhile,
represented and better informed parties, or parties who have been solicited in
ways more sophisticated and indirect, may be at work. Indeed, these parties,
either themselves or by their attorneys, investigators, and adjusters, are free to
contact the unrepresented persons to gather evidence or offer settlement. This
scheme makes little sense. As is often true when the law makes little sense, it is
not first principles but their interpretation and application that have gone awry.
Although I agree with the Court that the case can be resolved by following the
three-part inquiry we have identified to assess restrictions on commercial
speech, Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y. (1980),
a preliminary observation is in order. Speech has the capacity to convey
complex substance, yielding various insights and interpretations depending
upon the identity of the listener or the reader and the context of its
transmission. It would oversimplify to say that what we consider here is
commercial speech and nothing more, for in many instances the banned
communications may be vital to the recipients' right to petition the courts for
redress of grievances. The complex nature of expression is one reason why even
so-called commercial speech has become an essential part of the public
discourse the First Amendment secures. If our commercial speech rules are to
control this case, then, it is imperative to apply them with exacting care and
fidelity to our precedents, for what is at stake is the suppression of information
and knowledge that transcends the financial self-interests of the speaker.
I
As the Court notes, the first of the Central Hudson factors to be considered is
whether the interest the State pursues in enacting the speech restriction is a
substantial one. The State says two different interests meet this standard. The
first is the interest "in protecting the personal privacy and tranquility" of the
victim and his or her family. As the Court notes, that interest has recognition in
our decisions as a general matter; but it does not follow that the privacy
interest in the cases the majority cites is applicable here.
*** But we do not allow restrictions on speech to be justified on the ground that
the expression might offend the listener. ***
In the face of these difficulties of logic and precedent, the State and the opinion
of the Court turn to a second interest: protecting the reputation and dignity of
the legal profession. The argument is, it seems fair to say, that all are demeaned
by the crass behavior of a few. The argument takes a further step in the amicus
brief filed by the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. There it is said that
disrespect for the profession from this sort of solicitation (but presumably from

Robson

745

The First Amendment

no other sort of solicitation) results in lower jury verdicts. In a sense, of course,
these arguments are circular. While disrespect will arise from an unethical or
improper practice, the majority begs a most critical question by assuming that
direct-mail solicitations constitute such a practice. The fact is, however, that
direct solicitation may serve vital purposes and promote the administration of
justice, and to the extent the bar seeks to protect lawyers' reputations by
preventing them from engaging in speech some deem offensive, the State is
doing nothing more (as amicus the Association of Trial Lawyers of America is at
least candid enough to admit) than manipulating the public's opinion by
suppressing speech that informs us how the legal system works. The disrespect
argument thus proceeds from the very assumption it tries to prove, which is to
say that solicitations within 30 days serve no legitimate purpose. This, of course,
is censorship pure and simple; and censorship is antithetical to the first
principles of free expression.
II
Even were the interests asserted substantial, the regulation here fails the
second part of the Central Hudson test, which requires that the dangers the
State seeks to eliminate be real and that a speech restriction or ban advance
that asserted state interest in a direct and material way. The burden of
demonstrating the reality of the asserted harm rests on the State. Slight
evidence in this regard does not mean there is sufficient evidence to support the
claims. Here, what the State has offered falls well short of demonstrating that
the harms it is trying to redress are real, let alone that the regulation directly
and materially advances the State's interests. The parties and the Court have
used the term "Summary of Record" to describe a document prepared by the
Florida Bar (Bar), one of the adverse parties, and submitted to the District
Court in this case. This document includes no actual surveys, few indications of
sample size or selection procedures, no explanations of methodology, and no
discussion of excluded results. There is no description of the statistical universe
or scientific framework that permits any productive use of the information the
so-called Summary of Record contains. The majority describes this anecdotal
matter as "noteworthy for its breadth and detail," but when examined, it is
noteworthy for its incompetence. The selective synopses of unvalidated studies
deal, for the most part, with television advertising and phone book listings, and
not direct-mail solicitations. ***
It is telling that the essential thrust of all the material adduced to justify the
State's interest is devoted to the reputational concerns of the Bar. It is not at all
clear that this regulation advances the interest of protecting persons who are
suffering trauma and grief, and we are cited to no material in the record for that
claim. Indeed, when asked at oral argument what a "typical injured plaintiff
get[s] in the mail," the Bar's lawyer replied: "That's not in the record. . . and I
don't know the answer to that question." Having declared that the privacy
interest is one both substantial and served by the regulation, the Court ought
not to be excused from justifying its conclusion.
III
The insufficiency of the regulation to advance the State's interest is reinforced
by the third inquiry necessary in this analysis. Were it appropriate to reach the
third part of the Central Hudson test, it would be clear that the relationship

Robson

746

The First Amendment

between the Bar's interests and the means chosen to serve them is not a
reasonable fit. The Bar's rule creates a flat ban that prohibits far more speech
than necessary to serve the purported state interest. Even assuming that
interest were legitimate, there is a wild disproportion between the harm
supposed and the speech ban enforced. It is a disproportion the Court does not
bother to discuss, but our speech jurisprudence requires that it do so. Central
Hudson; Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox (1989).
To begin with, the ban applies with respect to all accidental injuries, whatever
their gravity. The Court's purported justification for the excess of regulation in
this respect is the difficulty of drawing lines between severe and less serious
injuries, but making such distinctions is not important in this analysis. Even
were it significant, the Court's assertion is unconvincing. After all, the criminal
law routinely distinguishes degrees of bodily harm, and if that delineation is
permissible and workable in the criminal context, it should not be "hard to
imagine the contours of a regulation" that satisfies the reasonable fit
requirement.
There is, moreover, simply no justification for assuming that in all or most
cases an attorney's advice would be unwelcome or unnecessary when the
survivors or the victim must at once begin assessing their legal and financial
position in a rational manner. With regard to lesser injuries, there is little
chance that for any period, much less 30 days, the victims will become
distraught upon hearing from an attorney. It is, in fact, more likely a real risk
that some victims might think no attorney will be interested enough to help
them. It is at this precise time that sound legal advice may be necessary and
most urgent.***
IV
It is most ironic that, for the first time since Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, the
Court now orders a major retreat from the constitutional guarantees for
commercial speech in order to shield its own profession from public criticism.
Obscuring the financial aspect of the legal profession from public discussion
through direct-mail solicitation, at the expense of the least sophisticated
members of society, is not a laudable constitutional goal. There is no authority
for the proposition that the Constitution permits the State to promote the
public image of the legal profession by suppressing information about the
profession's business aspects. If public respect for the profession erodes
because solicitation distorts the idea of the law as most lawyers see it, it must
be remembered that real progress begins with more rational speech, not less. I
agree that if this amounts to mere "sermonizing," the attempt may be futile. The
guiding principle, however, is that full and rational discussion furthers sound
regulation and necessary reform. The image of the profession cannot be
enhanced without improving the substance of its practice. The objective of the
profession is to ensure that "the ethical standards of lawyers are linked to the
service and protection of clients."
Today's opinion is a serious departure, not only from our prior decisions
involving attorney advertising, but also from the principles that govern the
transmission of commercial speech. The Court's opinion reflects a new-found
and illegitimate confidence that it, along with the Supreme Court of Florida,
knows what is best for the Bar and its clients. Self-assurance has always been

Robson

747

The First Amendment

the hallmark of a censor. That is why under the First Amendment the public,
not the State, has the right and the power to decide what ideas and information
are deserving of their adherence. "[T]he general rule is that the speaker and the
audience, not the government, assess the value of the information presented."
By validating Florida's rule, today's majority is complicit in the Bar's censorship.
For these reasons, I dissent from the opinion of the Court and from its
judgment.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
In January 1999, the Attorney General of Massachusetts promulgated
comprehensive regulations governing the advertising and sale of cigarettes,
smokeless tobacco, and cigars. 940 Code of Mass. Regs. §§21.01-21.07, 22.0122.09 (2000). Petitioners, a group of cigarette, smokeless tobacco, and cigar
manufacturers and retailers, filed suit in Federal District Court claiming that
the regulations violate federal law and the United States Constitution. In large
measure, the District Court determined that the regulations are valid and
enforceable. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed in
part and reversed in part, concluding that the regulations are not pre-empted
by federal law and do not violate the First Amendment. The first question
presented for our review is whether certain cigarette advertising regulations are
pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), 79
Stat. 282, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §1331 et seq. The second question presented
is whether certain regulations governing the advertising and sale of tobacco
products violate the First Amendment.
I
In November 1998, Massachusetts, along with over 40 other States, reached a
landmark agreement with major manufacturers in the cigarette industry. The
signatory States settled their claims against these companies in exchange for
monetary payments and permanent injunctive relief. At the press conference
covering Massachusetts' decision to sign the agreement, then-Attorney General
Scott Harshbarger announced that as one of his last acts in office, he would
create consumer protection regulations to restrict advertising and sales
practices for tobacco products. He explained that the regulations were

Robson

748

The First Amendment

necessary in order to "close holes" in the settlement agreement and "to stop Big
Tobacco from recruiting new customers among the children of Massachusetts."
In January 1999, pursuant to his authority to prevent unfair or deceptive
practices in trade, the Massachusetts Attorney General (Attorney General)
promulgated regulations governing the sale and advertisement of cigarettes,
smokeless tobacco, and cigars. The purpose of the cigarette and smokeless
tobacco regulations is "to eliminate deception and unfairness in the way
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are marketed, sold and distributed
in Massachusetts in order to address the incidence of cigarette smoking and
smokeless tobacco use by children under legal age .... [and] in order to prevent
access to such products by underage consumers." The similar purpose of the
cigar regulations is "to eliminate deception and unfairness in the way cigars
and little cigars are packaged, marketed, sold and distributed in Massachusetts
[so that] ... consumers may be adequately informed about the health risks
associated with cigar smoking, its addictive properties, and the false perception
that cigars are a safe alternative to cigarettes ... [and so that] the incidence of
cigar use by children under legal age is addressed ... in order to prevent access
to such products by underage consumers." The regulations have a broader
scope than the master settlement agreement, reaching advertising, sales
practices, and members of the tobacco industry not covered by the agreement.
The regulations place a variety of restrictions on outdoor advertising, point-ofsale advertising, retail sales transactions, transactions by mail, promotions,
sampling of products, and labels for cigars.
The cigarette and smokeless tobacco regulations being challenged before this
Court provide:
"(2) Retail Outlet Sales Practices. Except as otherwise provided in [§21.04(4)], it shall be
an unfair or deceptive act or practice for any person who sells or distributes cigarettes or
smokeless tobacco products through a retail outlet located within Massachusetts to
engage in any of the following retail outlet sales practices:
.....
"(c) Using self-service displays of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products;
"(d) Failing to place cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products out of the reach of all
consumers, and in a location accessible only to outlet personnel."
"(5) Advertising Restrictions. Except as provided in [§21.04(6)], it shall be an unfair or
deceptive act or practice for any manufacturer, distributor or retailer to engage in any of
the following practices:
"(a) Outdoor advertising, including advertising in enclosed stadiums and advertising from
within a retail establishment that is directed toward or visible from the outside of the
establishment, in any location that is within a 1,000 foot radius of any public playground,
playground area in a public park, elementary school or secondary school;
"(b) Point-of-sale advertising of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products any portion of
which is placed lower than five feet from the floor of any retail establishment which is
located within a one thousand foot radius of any public playground, playground area in a
public park, elementary school or secondary school, and which is not an adult-only retail
establishment."

The cigar regulations that are still at issue provide:
"(1) Retail Sales Practices. Except as otherwise provided in [§22.06(4)], it shall be an
unfair or deceptive act or practice for any person who sells or distributes cigars or little
cigars directly to consumers within Massachusetts to engage in any of the following
practices:
"(a) sampling of cigars or little cigars or promotional give-aways of cigars or little cigars."

Robson

749

The First Amendment

"(2) Retail Outlet Sales Practices. Except as otherwise provided in [§22.06(4)], it shall be
an unfair or deceptive act or practice for any person who sells or distributes cigars or
little cigars through a retail outlet located within Massachusetts to engage in any of the
following retail outlet sales practices:
.....
"(c) Using self-service displays of cigars or little cigars;
"(d) Failing to place cigars and little cigars out of the reach of all consumers, and in a
location accessible only to outlet personnel."
"(5) Advertising Restrictions. Except as provided in [§22.06(6)], it shall be an unfair or
deceptive act or practice for any manufacturer, distributor or retailer to engage in any of
the following practices:
"(a) Outdoor advertising of cigars or little cigars, including advertising in enclosed
stadiums and advertising from within a retail establishment that is directed toward or
visible from the outside of the establishment, in any location within a 1,000 foot radius of
any public playground, playground area in a public park, elementary school or secondary
school;
"(b) Point-of-sale advertising of cigars or little cigars any portion of which is placed lower
than five feet from the floor of any retail establishment which is located within a one
thousand foot radius of any public playground, playground area in a public park,
elementary school or secondary school, and which is not an adult-only retail
establishment."

The term "advertisement" is defined as:
"any oral, written, graphic, or pictorial statement or representation, made by, or on behalf
of, any person who manufactures, packages, imports for sale, distributes or sells within
Massachusetts [tobacco products], the purpose or effect of which is to promote the use or
sale of the product. Advertisement includes, without limitation, any picture, logo, symbol,
motto, selling message, graphic display, visual image, recognizable color or pattern of
colors, or any other indicia of product identification identical or similar to, or identifiable
with, those used for any brand of [tobacco product]. This includes, without limitation,
utilitarian items and permanent or semi-permanent fixtures with such indicia of product
identification such as lighting fixtures, awnings, display cases, clocks and door mats, but
does not include utilitarian items with a volume of 200 cubic inches or less."

Before the effective date of the regulations, February 1, 2000, members of the
tobacco industry sued the Attorney General in the United States District Court
for the District of Massachusetts. Four cigarette manufacturers (Lorillard
Tobacco Company, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company, and Philip Morris Incorporated), a maker of smokeless
tobacco products (U. S. Smokeless Tobacco Company), and several cigar
manufacturers and retailers claimed that many of the regulations violate the
Commerce Clause, the Supremacy Clause, the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, and Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983. The parties sought
summary judgment.
In its first ruling, the District Court considered the Supremacy Clause claim***
In a separate ruling, the District Court considered the claim that the Attorney
General's regulations violate the First Amendment. Rejecting petitioners'
argument that strict scrutiny should apply, the court applied the four-part test
of Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y. (1980), for
commercial speech. The court reasoned that the Attorney General had provided
an adequate basis for regulating cigars and smokeless tobacco as well as
cigarettes because of the similarities among the products. The court held that
the outdoor advertising regulations, which prohibit outdoor advertising within
1,000 feet of a school or playground, do not violate the First Amendment
because they advance a substantial government interest and are narrowly

Robson

750

The First Amendment

tailored to suppress no more speech than necessary. The court concluded that
the sales practices regulations, which restrict the location and distribution of
tobacco products, survive scrutiny because they do not implicate a significant
speech interest. The court invalidated the point-of-sale advertising regulations,
which require that indoor advertising be placed no lower than five feet from the
floor, finding that the Attorney General had not provided sufficient justification
for that restriction. The District Court's ruling with respect to the cigar warning
requirements and the Commerce Clause is not before this Court.
The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued a stay pending
appeal and affirmed in part and reversed in part the District Court's judgment.
***
With respect to the First Amendment, the Court of Appeals applied the Central
Hudson test. The court held that the outdoor advertising regulations do not
violate the First Amendment. The court concluded that the restriction on
outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or playground directly
advances the State's substantial interest in preventing tobacco use by minors.
The court also found that the outdoor advertising regulations restrict no more
speech than necessary, reasoning that the distance chosen by the Attorney
General is the sort of determination better suited for legislative and executive
decisionmakers than courts. The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's
invalidation of the point-of-sale advertising regulations, again concluding that
the Attorney General is better suited to determine what restrictions are
necessary. The Court of Appeals also held that the sales practices regulations
are valid under the First Amendment. The court found that the regulations
directly advance the State's interest in preventing minors' access to tobacco
products and that the regulations are narrowly tailored because retailers have a
variety of other means to present the packaging of their products and to allow
customers to examine the products. ***
The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending disposition of a petition for a
writ of certiorari. The cigarette manufacturers and U. S. Smokeless Tobacco
Company filed a petition, challenging the Court of Appeals' decision with
respect to the outdoor and point-of-sale advertising regulations on pre-emption
and First Amendment grounds, and the sales practices regulations on First
Amendment grounds. The cigar companies filed a separate petition, again
raising a First Amendment challenge to the outdoor advertising, point-of-sale
advertising, and sales practices regulations. We granted both petitions to
resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals with respect to whether the
FCLAA pre-empts cigarette advertising regulations like those at issue here, and
to decide the important First Amendment issues presented in these cases.

III
By its terms, the FCLAA's pre-emption provision only applies to cigarettes.
Accordingly, we must evaluate the smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners'
First Amendment challenges to the State's outdoor and point-of-sale advertising
regulations. The cigarette petitioners did not raise a pre-emption challenge to
the sales practices regulations. Thus, we must analyze the cigarette as well as

the smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners' claim that certain sales practices
regulations for tobacco products violate the First Amendment.
A
For over 25 years, the Court has recognized that commercial speech does not
fall outside the purview of the First Amendment. Instead, the Court has
afforded commercial speech a measure of First Amendment protection "
`commensurate' " with its position in relation to other constitutionally
guaranteed expression. In recognition of the "distinction between speech
proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally
subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech," Central
Hudson, we developed a framework for analyzing regulations of commercial
speech that is "substantially similar" to the test for time, place, and manner
restrictions, Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox. The analysis
contains four elements:
"At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by
the First Amendment. For commercial speech to come within that
provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.
Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.
If both inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine whether the
regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and
whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest."
Central Hudson.
Petitioners urge us to reject the Central Hudson analysis and apply strict
scrutiny. They are not the first litigants to do so. See, e.g., Greater New Orleans
Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United States (1999). Admittedly, several Members of
the Court have expressed doubts about the Central Hudson analysis and
whether it should apply in particular cases. See, e.g., Greater New Orleans,
(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island (1996)
(joint opinion of Stevens, Kennedy, and Ginsburg, JJ.), (Scalia, J. concurring in
part and concurring in judgment), (Thomas, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). But here, as in Greater New Orleans, we see "no need
to break new ground. Central Hudson, as applied in our more recent
commercial speech cases, provides an adequate basis for decision."
Only the last two steps of Central Hudson's four-part analysis are at issue here.
The Attorney General has assumed for purposes of summary judgment that
petitioners' speech is entitled to First Amendment protection. With respect to
the second step, none of the petitioners contests the importance of the State's
interest in preventing the use of tobacco products by minors.
The third step of Central Hudson concerns the relationship between the harm
that underlies the State's interest and the means identified by the State to
advance that interest. It requires that
"the speech restriction directly and materially advanc[e] the asserted
governmental interest. `This burden is not satisfied by mere speculation
or conjecture; rather, a governmental body seeking to sustain a
restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it
recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a
material degree.' "

Greater New Orleans.
We do not, however, require that "empirical data come ... accompanied by a
surfeit of background information... [W]e have permitted litigants to justify
speech restrictions by reference to studies and anecdotes pertaining to different
locales altogether, or even, in a case applying strict scrutiny, to justify
restrictions based solely on history, consensus, and `simple common sense.' "
Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc.,
The last step of the Central Hudson analysis "complements" the third step,
"asking whether the speech restriction is not more extensive than necessary to
serve the interests that support it." We have made it clear that "the least
restrictive means" is not the standard; instead, the case law requires a
reasonable " `fit between the legislature's ends and the means chosen to
accomplish those ends, ... a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired
objective.' " Focusing on the third and fourth steps of the Central Hudson
analysis, we first address the outdoor advertising and point-of-sale advertising
regulations for smokeless tobacco and cigars. We then address the sales
practices regulations for all tobacco products.
B
The outdoor advertising regulations prohibit smokeless tobacco or cigar
advertising within a 1,000-foot radius of a school or playground. The District
Court and Court of Appeals concluded that the Attorney General had identified
a real problem with underage use of tobacco products, that limiting youth
exposure to advertising would combat that problem, and that the regulations
burdened no more speech than necessary to accomplish the State's goal. The
smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners take issue with all of these conclusions.
1
The smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners contend that the Attorney
General's regulations do not satisfy Central Hudson's third step. They maintain
that although the Attorney General may have identified a problem with
underage cigarette smoking, he has not identified an equally severe problem
with respect to underage use of smokeless tobacco or cigars. The smokeless
tobacco petitioner emphasizes the "lack of parity" between cigarettes and
smokeless tobacco. The cigar petitioners catalogue a list of differences between
cigars and other tobacco products, including the characteristics of the products
and marketing strategies. The petitioners finally contend that the Attorney
General cannot prove that advertising has a causal link to tobacco use such
that limiting advertising will materially alleviate any problem of underage use of
their products.
In previous cases, we have acknowledged the theory that product advertising
stimulates demand for products, while suppressed advertising may have the
opposite effect. The Attorney General cites numerous studies to support this
theory in the case of tobacco products.
The Attorney General relies in part on evidence gathered by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in its attempt to regulate the advertising of cigarettes and
smokeless tobacco. The FDA promulgated the advertising regulations after
finding that the period prior to adulthood is when an overwhelming majority of
Americans first decide to use tobacco products, and that advertising plays a

Robson

753

The First Amendment

crucial role in that decision. We later held that the FDA lacks statutory
authority to regulate tobacco products. See FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco
Corp. (2000). Nevertheless, the Attorney General relies on the FDA's proceedings
and other studies to support his decision that advertising affects demand for
tobacco products.
In its rulemaking proceeding, the FDA considered several studies of tobacco
advertising and trends in the use of various tobacco products. The Surgeon
General's report and the Institute of Medicine's report found that "there is
sufficient evidence to conclude that advertising and labeling play a significant
and important contributory role in a young person's decision to use cigarettes
or smokeless tobacco products."
For instance, children smoke fewer brands of cigarettes than adults, and those
choices directly track the most heavily advertised brands, unlike adult choices,
which are more dispersed and related to pricing. Another study revealed that
72% of 6 year olds and 52% of children ages 3 to 6 recognized "Joe Camel," the
cartoon anthropomorphic symbol of R. J. Reynolds' Camel brand cigarettes.
After the introduction of Joe Camel, Camel cigarettes' share of the youth market
rose from 4% to 13%. The FDA also identified trends in tobacco consumption
among certain populations, such as young women, that correlated to the
introduction and marketing of products geared toward that population.
The FDA also made specific findings with respect to smokeless tobacco. The
FDA concluded that "[t]he recent and very large increase in the use of
smokeless tobacco products by young people and the addictive nature of these
products has persuaded the agency that these products must be included in
any regulatory approach that is designed to help prevent future generations of
young people from becoming addicted to nicotine-containing tobacco products."
Studies have analyzed smokeless tobacco use by young people, discussing
trends based on gender, school grade, and locale.
Researchers tracked a dramatic shift in patterns of smokeless tobacco use from
older to younger users over the past 30 years. In particular, the smokeless
tobacco industry boosted sales tenfold in the 1970s and 1980s by targeting
young males. Another study documented the targeting of youth through
smokeless tobacco sales and advertising techniques.
The Attorney General presents different evidence with respect to cigars. There
was no data on underage cigar use prior to 1996 because the behavior was
considered "uncommon enough not to be worthy of examination." In 1995, the
FDA decided not to include cigars in its attempted regulation of tobacco product
advertising, explaining that "the agency does not currently have sufficient
evidence that these products are drug delivery devices ... . FDA has focused its
investigation of its authority over tobacco products on cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco products, and not on pipe tobacco or cigars, because young people
predominantly use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products."
More recently, however, data on youth cigar use has emerged. The National
Cancer Institute concluded in its 1998 Monograph that the rate of cigar use by
minors is increasing and that, in some States, the cigar use rates are higher
than the smokeless tobacco use rates for minors. In its 1999 Report to

Robson

754

The First Amendment

Congress, the FTC concluded that "substantial numbers of adolescents are
trying cigars."
Studies have also demonstrated a link between advertising and demand for
cigars. After Congress recognized the power of images in advertising and
banned cigarette advertising in electronic media, television advertising of small
cigars "increased dramatically in 1972 and 1973," "filled the void left by
cigarette advertisers," and "sales ... soared." In 1973, Congress extended the
electronic media advertising ban for cigarettes to little cigars. In the 1990s,
cigar advertising campaigns triggered a boost in sales.
Our review of the record reveals that the Attorney General has provided ample
documentation of the problem with underage use of smokeless tobacco and
cigars. In addition, we disagree with petitioners' claim that there is no evidence
that preventing targeted campaigns and limiting youth exposure to advertising
will decrease underage use of smokeless tobacco and cigars. On this record and
in the posture of summary judgment, we are unable to conclude that the
Attorney General's decision to regulate advertising of smokeless tobacco and
cigars in an effort to combat the use of tobacco products by minors was based
on mere "speculation [and] conjecture."
2
Whatever the strength of the Attorney General's evidence to justify the outdoor
advertising regulations, however, we conclude that the regulations do not
satisfy the fourth step of the Central Hudson analysis. The final step of the
Central Hudson analysis, the "critical inquiry in this case," requires a
reasonable fit between the means and ends of the regulatory scheme. The
Attorney General's regulations do not meet this standard. The broad sweep of
the regulations indicates that the Attorney General did not "carefully calculat[e]
the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed" by the
regulations.
The outdoor advertising regulations prohibit any smokeless tobacco or cigar
advertising within 1,000 feet of schools or playgrounds. In the District Court,
petitioners maintained that this prohibition would prevent advertising in 87% to
91% of Boston, Worchester, and Springfield, Massachusetts. The 87% to 91%
figure appears to include not only the effect of the regulations, but also the
limitations imposed by other generally applicable zoning restrictions. The
Attorney General disputed petitioners' figures but "concede[d] that the reach of
the regulations is substantial." Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that the
regulations prohibit advertising in a substantial portion of the major
metropolitan areas of Massachusetts.
The substantial geographical reach of the Attorney General's outdoor
advertising regulations is compounded by other factors. "Outdoor" advertising
includes not only advertising located outside an establishment, but also
advertising inside a store if that advertising is visible from outside the store.
The regulations restrict advertisements of any size and the term advertisement
also includes oral statements.
In some geographical areas, these regulations would constitute nearly a
complete ban on the communication of truthful information about smokeless
tobacco and cigars to adult consumers. The breadth and scope of the

Robson

755

The First Amendment

regulations, and the process by which the Attorney General adopted the
regulations, do not demonstrate a careful calculation of the speech interests
involved.
First, the Attorney General did not seem to consider the impact of the 1,000foot restriction on commercial speech in major metropolitan areas. The Attorney
General apparently selected the 1,000-foot distance based on the FDA's
decision to impose an identical 1,000-foot restriction when it attempted to
regulate cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising. But the FDA's 1,000-foot
regulation was not an adequate basis for the Attorney General to tailor the
Massachusetts regulations. The degree to which speech is suppressed--or
alternative avenues for speech remain available--under a particular regulatory
scheme tends to be case specific. And a case specific analysis makes sense, for
although a State or locality may have common interests and concerns about
underage smoking and the effects of tobacco advertisements, the impact of a
restriction on speech will undoubtedly vary from place to place. The FDA's
regulations would have had widely disparate effects nationwide. Even in
Massachusetts, the effect of the Attorney General's speech regulations will vary
based on whether a locale is rural, suburban, or urban. The uniformly broad
sweep of the geographical limitation demonstrates a lack of tailoring.
In addition, the range of communications restricted seems unduly broad. For
instance, it is not clear from the regulatory scheme why a ban on oral
communications is necessary to further the State's interest. Apparently that
restriction means that a retailer is unable to answer inquiries about its tobacco
products if that communication occurs outdoors. Similarly, a ban on all signs of
any size seems ill suited to target the problem of highly visible billboards, as
opposed to smaller signs. To the extent that studies have identified particular
advertising and promotion practices that appeal to youth, tailoring would
involve targeting those practices while permitting others. As crafted, the
regulations make no distinction among practices on this basis.
The Court of Appeals recognized that the smokeless tobacco and cigar
petitioners' concern about the amount of speech restricted was "valid," but
reasoned that there was an "obvious connection to the state's interest in
protecting minors." Even on the premise that Massachusetts has demonstrated
a connection between the outdoor advertising regulations and its substantial
interest in preventing underage tobacco use, the question of tailoring remains.
The Court of Appeals failed to follow through with an analysis of the
countervailing First Amendment interests.
The State's interest in preventing underage tobacco use is substantial, and even
compelling, but it is no less true that the sale and use of tobacco products by
adults is a legal activity. We must consider that tobacco retailers and
manufacturers have an interest in conveying truthful information about their
products to adults, and adults have a corresponding interest in receiving
truthful information about tobacco products. In a case involving indecent
speech on the Internet we explained that "the governmental interest in
protecting children from harmful materials ... does not justify an unnecessarily
broad suppression of speech addressed to adults." Reno v. American Civil
Liberties Union (1997). See, e.g., Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp. (1983)
("The level of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that

Robson

756

The First Amendment

which would be suitable for a sandbox"); Butler v. Michigan (1957) ("The
incidence of this enactment is to reduce the adult population ... to reading only
what is fit for children"). As the State protects children from tobacco
advertisements, tobacco manufacturers and retailers and their adult consumers
still have a protected interest in communication.
In some instances, Massachusetts' outdoor advertising regulations would
impose particularly onerous burdens on speech. For example, we disagree with
the Court of Appeals' conclusion that because cigar manufacturers and retailers
conduct a limited amount of advertising in comparison to other tobacco
products, "the relative lack of cigar advertising also means that the burden
imposed on cigar advertisers is correspondingly small." If some retailers have
relatively small advertising budgets, and use few avenues of communication,
then the Attorney General's outdoor advertising regulations potentially place a
greater, not lesser, burden on those retailers' speech. Furthermore, to the
extent that cigar products and cigar advertising differ from that of other tobacco
products, that difference should inform the inquiry into what speech
restrictions are necessary.
In addition, a retailer in Massachusetts may have no means of communicating
to passersby on the street that it sells tobacco products because alternative
forms of advertisement, like newspapers, do not allow that retailer to propose
an instant transaction in the way that onsite advertising does. The ban on any
indoor advertising that is visible from the outside also presents problems in
establishments like convenience stores, which have unique security concerns
that counsel in favor of full visibility of the store from the outside. It is these
sorts of considerations that the Attorney General failed to incorporate into the
regulatory scheme.
We conclude that the Attorney General has failed to show that the outdoor
advertising regulations for smokeless tobacco and cigars are not more extensive
than necessary to advance the State's substantial interest in preventing
underage tobacco use. Justice Stevens urges that the Court remand the case for
further development of the factual record. We believe that a remand is
inappropriate in this case because the State had ample opportunity to develop a
record with respect to tailoring (as it had to justify its decision to regulate
advertising), and additional evidence would not alter the nature of the scheme
before the Court.
A careful calculation of the costs of a speech regulation does not mean that a
State must demonstrate that there is no incursion on legitimate speech
interests, but a speech regulation cannot unduly impinge on the speaker's
ability to propose a commercial transaction and the adult listener's opportunity
to obtain information about products. After reviewing the outdoor advertising
regulations, we find the calculation in this case insufficient for purposes of the
First Amendment.
C
Massachusetts has also restricted indoor, point-of-sale advertising for
smokeless tobacco and cigars. Advertising cannot be "placed lower than five feet
from the floor of any retail establishment which is located within a one
thousand foot radius of" any school or playground. The District Court

Robson

757

The First Amendment

invalidated these provisions, concluding that the Attorney General had not
provided a sufficient basis for regulating indoor advertising. The Court of
Appeals reversed. The court explained: "We do have some misgivings about the
effectiveness of a restriction that is based on the assumption that minors under
five feet tall will not, or will less frequently, raise their view above eye-level, but
we find that such [a] determination falls within that range of reasonableness in
which the Attorney General is best suited to pass judgment."
We conclude that the point-of-sale advertising regulations fail both the third
and fourth steps of the Central Hudson analysis. A regulation cannot be
sustained if it " `provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's
purpose,' " or if there is "little chance" that the restriction will advance the
State's goal. As outlined above, the State's goal is to prevent minors from using
tobacco products and to curb demand for that activity by limiting youth
exposure to advertising. The 5 foot rule does not seem to advance that goal. Not
all children are less than 5 feet tall, and those who are certainly have the ability
to look up and take in their surroundings.
By contrast to Justice Stevens, we do not believe this regulation can be
construed as a mere regulation of conduct under United States v. O'Brien (1968).
To qualify as a regulation of communicative action governed by the scrutiny
outlined in O'Brien, the State's regulation must be unrelated to expression. Here,
Massachusetts' height restriction is an attempt to regulate directly the
communicative impact of indoor advertising.
Massachusetts may wish to target tobacco advertisements and displays that
entice children, much like floor-level candy displays in a convenience store, but
the blanket height restriction does not constitute a reasonable fit with that goal.
The Court of Appeals recognized that the efficacy of the regulation was
questionable, but decided that "[i]n any event, the burden on speech imposed
by the provision is very limited." There is no de minimis exception for a speech
restriction that lacks sufficient tailoring or justification. We conclude that the
restriction on the height of indoor advertising is invalid under Central Hudson's
third and fourth prongs.
D
The Attorney General also promulgated a number of regulations that restrict
sales practices by cigarette, smokeless tobacco, and cigar manufacturers and
retailers. Among other restrictions, the regulations bar the use of self-service
displays and require that tobacco products be placed out of the reach of all
consumers in a location accessible only to salespersons. *** Two of the cigarette
petitioners (Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation and Lorillard Tobacco
Company), petitioner U. S. Smokeless Tobacco Company, and the cigar
petitioners challenge the sales practices regulations on First Amendment
grounds. The cigar petitioners additionally challenge a provision that prohibits
sampling or promotional giveaways of cigars or little cigars.
The District Court concluded that these restrictions implicate no cognizable
speech interest, but the Court of Appeals did not fully adopt that reasoning. The
Court of Appeals recognized that self-service displays "often do have some
communicative commercial function," but noted that the restriction in the
regulations "is not on speech, but rather on the physical location of actual

Robson

758

The First Amendment

tobacco products." The court reasoned that nothing in the regulations would
prevent the display of empty tobacco product containers, so long as no actual
tobacco product was displayed, much like movie jackets at a video store. With
respect to cigar products, the court observed that retailers traditionally allow
access to those products, so that the consumer may make a selection on the
basis of a number of objective and subjective factors including the aroma and
feel of the cigars. Even assuming a speech interest, however, the court
concluded that the regulations were narrowly tailored to serve the State's
substantial interest in preventing access to tobacco products by minors. The
court also noted that the restrictions do not apply to adult-only establishments.
Petitioners devoted little of their briefing to the sales practices regulations, and
our understanding of the regulations is accordingly limited by the parties'
submissions. As we read the regulations, they basically require tobacco retailers
to place tobacco products behind counters and require customers to have
contact with a salesperson before they are able to handle a tobacco product.
The cigarette and smokeless tobacco petitioners contend that "the same First
Amendment principles that require invalidation of the outdoor and indoor
advertising restrictions require invalidation of the display regulations at issue in
this case." The cigar petitioners contend that self-service displays for cigars
cannot be prohibited because each brand of cigar is unique and customers
traditionally have sought to handle and compare cigars at the time of purchase.
We reject these contentions. Assuming that petitioners have a cognizable
speech interest in a particular means of displaying their products, these
regulations withstand First Amendment scrutiny.
Massachusetts' sales practices provisions regulate conduct that may have a
communicative component, but Massachusetts seeks to regulate the placement
of tobacco products for reasons unrelated to the communication of ideas. We
conclude that the State has demonstrated a substantial interest in preventing
access to tobacco products by minors and has adopted an appropriately narrow
means of advancing that interest. See O'Brien.
Unattended displays of tobacco products present an opportunity for access
without the proper age verification required by law. Thus, the State prohibits
self-service and other displays that would allow an individual to obtain tobacco
products without direct contact with a salesperson. It is clear that the
regulations leave open ample channels of communication. The regulations do
not significantly impede adult access to tobacco products. Moreover, retailers
have other means of exercising any cognizable speech interest in the
presentation of their products. We presume that vendors may place empty
tobacco packaging on open display, and display actual tobacco products so long
as that display is only accessible to sales personnel. As for cigars, there is no
indication in the regulations that a customer is unable to examine a cigar prior
to purchase, so long as that examination takes place through a salesperson.
The cigar petitioners also list Massachusetts' prohibition on sampling and free
giveaways among the regulations they challenge on First Amendment grounds.
At no point in their briefs or at oral argument, however, did the cigar petitioners
argue the merits of their First Amendment claim with respect to the sampling

Robson

759

The First Amendment

and giveaway regulation. We decline to address an issue that was not
sufficiently briefed and argued before this Court.
We conclude that the sales practices regulations withstand First Amendment
scrutiny. The means chosen by the State are narrowly tailored to prevent access
to tobacco products by minors, are unrelated to expression, and leave open
alternative avenues for vendors to convey information about products and for
would-be customers to inspect products before purchase.
IV
We have observed that "tobacco use, particularly among children and
adolescents, poses perhaps the single most significant threat to public health in
the United States." From a policy perspective, it is understandable for the
States to attempt to prevent minors from using tobacco products before they
reach an age where they are capable of weighing for themselves the risks and
potential benefits of tobacco use, and other adult activities. Federal law,
however, places limits on policy choices available to the States.
In this case, Congress enacted a comprehensive scheme to address cigarette
smoking and health in advertising and pre-empted state regulation of cigarette
advertising that attempts to address that same concern, even with respect to
youth. The First Amendment also constrains state efforts to limit advertising of
tobacco products, because so long as the sale and use of tobacco is lawful for
adults, the tobacco industry has a protected interest in communicating
information about its products and adult customers have an interest in
receiving that information.
To the extent that federal law and the First Amendment do not prohibit state
action, States and localities remain free to combat the problem of underage
tobacco use by appropriate means. The judgment of the United States Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit is therefore affirmed in part and reversed in part,
and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.

The obvious overbreadth of the outdoor advertising restrictions suffices to
invalidate them under the fourth part of the test in Central Hudson Gas & Elec.

need to consider whether the restrictions satisfy the third part of the test, a
proposition about which there is considerable doubt. Neither are we required to
consider whether Central Hudson should be retained in the face of the
substantial objections that can be made to it. My continuing concerns that the
test gives insufficient protection to truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech
require me to refrain from expressing agreement with the Court's application of
the third part of Central Hudson. With the exception of Part III-B-1, then, I join

JUSTICE THOMAS, CONCURRING IN PART AND CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
I join the opinion of the Court (with the exception of Part III-B-1) because I
agree that the Massachusetts cigarette advertising regulations are preempted by
the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. I also agree with the Court's
disposition of the First Amendment challenges to the other regulations at issue
here, and I share the Court's view that the regulations fail even the intermediate
scrutiny of Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y.
(1980). At the same time, I continue to believe that when the government seeks
to restrict truthful speech in order to suppress the ideas it conveys, strict
scrutiny is appropriate, whether or not the speech in question may be
characterized as "commercial." See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island (1996)
(Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). I would subject all
of the advertising restrictions to strict scrutiny and would hold that they violate
the First Amendment.
***
III
Underlying many of the arguments of respondents and their amici is the idea
that tobacco is in some sense sui generis--that it is so special, so unlike any
other object of regulation, that application of normal First Amendment
principles should be suspended. Smoking poses serious health risks, and
advertising may induce children (who lack the judgment to make an intelligent
decision about whether to smoke) to begin smoking, which can lead to addiction.
The State's assessment of the urgency of the problem posed by tobacco is a
policy judgment, and it is not this Court's place to second-guess it. Nevertheless,
it seems appropriate to point out that to uphold the Massachusetts tobacco
regulations would be to accept a line of reasoning that would permit restrictions
on advertising for a host of other products.
Tobacco use is, we are told, "the single leading cause of preventable death in
the United States." The second largest contributor to mortality rates in the
United States is obesity. It is associated with increased incidence of diabetes,
hypertension, and coronary artery disease and it represents a public health
problem that is rapidly growing worse. Although the growth of obesity over the
last few decades has had many causes, a significant factor has been the
increased availability of large quantities of high-calorie, high-fat foods. Such
foods, of course, have been aggressively marketed and promoted by fast food
companies.
Respondents say that tobacco companies are covertly targeting children in their
advertising. Fast food companies do so openly. Moreover, there is considerable
evidence that they have been successful in changing children's eating behavior.
The effect of advertising on children's eating habits is significant for two reasons.
First, childhood obesity is a serious health problem in its own right. Second,
eating preferences formed in childhood tend to persist in adulthood. So even
though fast food is not addictive in the same way tobacco is, children's
exposure to fast food advertising can have deleterious consequences that are
difficult to reverse.
To take another example, the third largest cause of preventable deaths in the
United States is alcohol. Alcohol use is associated with tens of thousands of

Robson

761

The First Amendment

deaths each year from cancers and digestive diseases. And the victims of
alcohol use are not limited to those who drink alcohol. In 1996, over 17,000
people were killed, and over 321,000 people were injured, in alcohol-related car
accidents. Each year, alcohol is involved in several million violent crimes,
including almost 200,000 sexual assaults. Id., at 3-4.
Although every State prohibits the sale of alcohol to those under age 21, much
alcohol advertising is viewed by children. Not surprisingly, there is considerable
evidence that exposure to alcohol advertising is associated with underage
drinking.
Like underage tobacco use, underage drinking has effects that cannot be
undone later in life. Those who begin drinking early are much more likely to
become dependent on alcohol. Indeed, the probability of lifetime alcohol
dependence decreases approximately 14 percent with each additional year of
age at which alcohol is first used. And obviously the effects of underage
drinking are irreversible for the nearly 1,700 Americans killed each year by
teenage drunk drivers. See National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
1998 Youth Fatal Crash and Alcohol Facts.
Respondents have identified no principle of law or logic that would preclude the
imposition of restrictions on fast food and alcohol advertising similar to those
they seek to impose on tobacco advertising. In effect, they seek a "vice"
exception to the First Amendment. No such exception exists. See 44 Liquormart,
(opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Kennedy, Thomas, and Ginsburg, JJ.). If it did,
it would have almost no limit, for "any product that poses some threat to public
health or public morals might reasonably be characterized by a state legislature
as relating to `vice activity.' " That is why "a `vice' label that is unaccompanied
by a corresponding prohibition against the commercial behavior at issue fails to
provide a principled justification for the regulation of commercial speech about
that activity."
No legislature has ever sought to restrict speech about an activity it regarded as
harmless and inoffensive. Calls for limits on expression always are made when
the specter of some threatened harm is looming. The identity of the harm may
vary. People will be inspired by totalitarian dogmas and subvert the Republic.
They will be inflamed by racial demagoguery and embrace hatred and bigotry.
Or they will be enticed by cigarette advertisements and choose to smoke,
risking disease. It is therefore no answer for the State to say that the makers of
cigarettes are doing harm: perhaps they are. But in that respect they are no
different from the purveyors of other harmful products, or the advocates of
harmful ideas. When the State seeks to silence them, they are all entitled to the
protection of the First Amendment.

The First Amendment

Notes	  
1. The Central Hudson four-part test remains the standard for assessing
the constitutionality of “commercial speech.” As the Court notes in
Lorillard Tobacco, there have been many suggestions that the test be
reconsidered or rejected. One argument for a rejection of the test is that
there is - - - or should be - - - no category of commercial speech in First
Amendment doctrine.
2. The question of compelled commercial speech, especially with regard
to labeling regulations is the subject of vigorous First Amendment
litigation. In the tobacco context, some courts have considered whether
the history of tobacco advertising as misleading or “potentially
misleading” should be considered in evaluating mandated disclosures
and applying Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court
of Ohio (1985), which has become best known for the portion of the
opinion considering the mandated disclosure.
In Disc. Tobacco City & Lottery, Inc. v. United States, 674 F.3d 509 (6th
Cir. 2012), the court applied Zauderer and upheld the labeling
requirements. Contrarily, in R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Food & Drug
Admin., 696 F.3d 1205 (D.C. Cir. 2012), a sharply divided panel held that
Central Hudson’s intermediate standard of review applied and that the
graphic FDA-mandated warnings were not constitutional because the
FDA did not provide substantial evidence that graphic warnings on
cigarette advertising would directly advance its interest in reducing
smoking rates to material degree.
However, the DC Circuit en banc explicitly overruled R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. v. Food & Drug Admin. in Am. Meat Inst. v. U.S. Dep't of Agric.,
760 F.3d 18 (D.C. Cir. en banc 2014).
American Meat Industry (AMI) involved a First Amendment challenge to
country-of-origin labels (COOL) on a variety of foods, including some
meat products. The court found the more minimal standard of Zauderer
applicable:
The starting point common to both parties is that Zauderer applies to
government mandates requiring disclosure of “purely factual and
uncontroversial information” appropriate to prevent deception in the regulated
party's commercial speech. The key question for us is whether the principles
articulated in Zauderer apply more broadly to factual and uncontroversial
disclosures required to serve other government interests. AMI also argues that
even if Zauderer extends beyond correction of deception, the government has no
interest in country-of-origin labeling substantial enough to sustain the
challenged rules.
Zauderer itself does not give a clear answer. Some of its language
suggests possible confinement to correcting deception. Having already described
the disclosure mandated there as limited to “purely factual and uncontroversial
information about the terms under which [the transaction was proposed],” the
Court said, “we hold that an advertiser's rights are adequately protected as long

Robson

763

The First Amendment

as [such] disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest
in preventing deception of consumers.” (It made no finding that the advertiser's
message was “more likely to deceive the public than to inform it,” which would
constitutionally subject the message to an outright ban. See Central Hudson. ***
The language with which Zauderer justified its approach, however, sweeps far
more broadly than the interest in remedying deception. After recounting the
elements of Central Hudson, Zauderer rejected that test as unnecessary in light
of the “material differences between disclosure requirements and outright
prohibitions on speech.” Later in the opinion, the Court observed that “the First
Amendment interests implicated by disclosure requirements are substantially
weaker than those at stake when speech is actually suppressed.” After noting
that the disclosure took the form of “purely factual and uncontroversial
information about the terms under which [the] services will be available,” the
Court characterized the speaker's interest as “minimal”: “Because the extension
of First Amendment protection to commercial speech is justified principally by
the value to consumers of the information such speech provides, appellant's
constitutionally protected interest in not providing any particular factual
information in his advertising is minimal.” All told, Zauderer 's characterization
of the speaker's interest in opposing forced disclosure of such information as
“minimal” seems inherently applicable beyond the problem of deception, as
other circuits have found.

THOMAS, ALITO, AND SOTOMAYOR, JJ., JOINED. BREYER, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN
WHICH GINSBURG AND KAGAN, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Vermont law restricts the sale, disclosure, and use of pharmacy records that
reveal the prescribing practices of individual doctors. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, §
4631 (Supp. 2010). Subject to certain exceptions, the information may not be
sold, disclosed by pharmacies for marketing purposes, or used for marketing by
pharmaceutical manufacturers. Vermont argues that its prohibitions safeguard
medical privacy and diminish the likelihood that marketing will lead to
prescription decisions not in the best interests of patients or the State. It can be
assumed that these interests are significant. Speech in aid of pharmaceutical
marketing, however, is a form of expression protected by the Free Speech
Clause of the First Amendment. As a consequence, Vermont's statute must be
subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny. The law cannot satisfy that standard.
I
A
Pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their drugs to doctors through a
process called "detailing." This often involves a scheduled visit to a doctor's
office to persuade the doctor to prescribe a particular pharmaceutical. Detailers
bring drug samples as well as medical studies that explain the "details" and

Robson

764

The First Amendment

potential advantages of various prescription drugs. Interested physicians listen,
ask questions, and receive followup data. Salespersons can be more effective
when they know the background and purchasing preferences of their clientele,
and pharmaceutical salespersons are no exception. Knowledge of a physician's
prescription practices—called "prescriber-identifying information"—enables a
detailer better to ascertain which doctors are likely to be interested in a
particular drug and how best to present a particular sales message. Detailing is
an expensive undertaking, so pharmaceutical companies most often use it to
promote high-profit brand-name drugs protected by patent. Once a brand-name
drug's patent expires, less expensive bioequivalent generic alternatives are
manufactured and sold.
Pharmacies, as a matter of business routine and federal law, receive prescriberidentifying information when processing prescriptions. Many pharmacies sell
this information to "data miners," firms that analyze prescriber-identifying
information and produce reports on prescriber behavior. Data miners lease
these reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers subject to nondisclosure
agreements. Detailers, who represent the manufacturers, then use the reports
to refine their marketing tactics and increase sales.
In 2007, Vermont enacted the Prescription Confidentiality Law. The measure is
also referred to as Act 80. It has several components. The central provision of
the present case is § 4631(d).
"A health insurer, a self-insured employer, an electronic transmission
intermediary, a pharmacy, or other similar entity shall not sell, license,
or exchange for value regulated records containing prescriber-identifiable
information, nor permit the use of regulated records containing
prescriber-identifiable information for marketing or promoting a
prescription drug, unless the prescriber consents.. . . Pharmaceutical
manufacturers and pharmaceutical marketers shall not use prescriberidentifiable information for marketing or promoting a prescription drug
unless the prescriber consents. . . ."
*** Act 80 was accompanied by legislative findings. Vermont found, for example,
that the "goals of marketing programs are often in conflict with the goals of the
state" and that the "marketplace for ideas on medicine safety and effectiveness
is frequently one-sided in that brand-name companies invest in expensive
pharmaceutical marketing campaigns to doctors." Detailing, in the legislature's
view, caused doctors to make decisions based on "incomplete and biased
information." Because they "are unable to take the time to research the quickly
changing pharmaceutical market," Vermont doctors "rely on information
provided by pharmaceutical representatives." The legislature further found that
detailing increases the cost of health care and health insurance; encourages
hasty and excessive reliance on brand-name drugs, before the profession has
observed their effectiveness as compared with older and less expensive generic
alternatives; and fosters disruptive and repeated marketing visits tantamount to
harassment. The legislative findings further noted that use of prescriberidentifying information "increase[s] the effect of detailing programs" by allowing
detailers to target their visits to particular doctors. Use of prescriber-identifying
data also helps detailers shape their messages by "tailoring" their
"presentations to individual prescriber styles, preferences, and attitudes."

The First Amendment

B
The present case involves two consolidated suits. One was brought by three
Vermont data miners, the other by an association of pharmaceutical
manufacturers that produce brand-name drugs. These entities are the
respondents here. Contending that §4631(d) violates their First Amendment
rights as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, the respondents sought
declaratory and injunctive relief against the petitioners, the Attorney General
and other officials of the State of Vermont.
After a bench trial, the United States District Court for the District of Vermont
denied relief. The District Court found that “[p]harmaceutical manufacturers
are essentially the only paying customers of the data vendor industry” and that,
because detailing unpatented generic drugs is not “cost-effective,”
pharmaceutical sales representatives “detail only branded drugs.” As the
District Court further concluded, “the Legislature’s determination that
[prescriber- identifying] data is an effective marketing tool that enables detailers
to increase sales of new drugs is supported in the record.” The United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded. It held that
§4631(d) violates the First Amendment by burdening the speech of
pharmaceutical marketers and data miners without an adequate justification.
Judge Livingston dissented.
The decision of the Second Circuit is in conflict with decisions of the United
States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit concerning similar legislation
enacted by Maine and New Hampshire. Recognizing a division of authority
regarding the constitutionality of state statutes, this Court granted certiorari.
II
The beginning point is the text of §4631(d). *** [T]he opening clause of §4631(d)
prohibits pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities from selling
prescriber-identifying information, subject to the statutory exceptions set out at
§4631(e). Under that reading, pharmacies may sell the information to private or
academic researchers, see §4631(e)(1), but not, for example, to pharmaceutical
marketers. There is no dispute as to the remainder of §4631(d). It prohibits
pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities from disclosing or otherwise
allowing prescriber-identifying information to be used for marketing. And it bars
pharmaceutical manufacturers and detailers from using the information for
marketing. The questions now are whether §4631(d) must be tested by
heightened judicial scrutiny and, if so, whether the State can justify the law.
A
1
On its face, Vermont's law enacts content-and speaker-based restrictions on the
sale, disclosure, and use of prescriber-identifying information. The provision
first forbids sale subject to exceptions based in large part on the content of a
purchaser's speech. For example, those who wish to engage in certain
"educational communications," may purchase the information. The measure
then bars any disclosure when recipient speakers will use the information for
marketing. Finally, the provision's second sentence prohibits pharmaceutical
manufacturers from using the information for marketing. The statute thus

Robson

766

The First Amendment

disfavors marketing, that is, speech with a particular content. More than that,
the statute disfavors specific speakers, namely pharmaceutical manufacturers.
As a result of these content- and speaker-based rules, detailers cannot obtain
prescriber-identifying information, even though the information may be
purchased or acquired by other speakers with diverse purposes and viewpoints.
Detailers are likewise barred from using the information for marketing, even
though the information may be used by a wide range of other speakers. For
example, it appears that Vermont could supply academic organizations with
prescriber-identifying information to use in countering the messages of brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers and in promoting the prescription of
generic drugs. But § 4631(d) leaves detailers no means of purchasing, acquiring,
or using prescriber-identifying information. The law on its face burdens
disfavored speech by disfavored speakers.
Any doubt that § 4631(d) imposes an aimed, content-based burden on detailers
is dispelled by the record and by formal legislative findings. As the District
Court noted, "[p]harmaceutical manufacturers are essentially the only paying
customers of the data vendor industry"; and the almost invariable rule is that
detailing by pharmaceutical manufacturers is in support of brand-name drugs.
Vermont's law thus has the effect of preventing detailers—and only detailers—
from communicating with physicians in an effective and informative manner.
Formal legislative findings accompanying § 4631(d) confirm that the law's
express purpose and practical effect are to diminish the effectiveness of
marketing by manufacturers of brand-name drugs. Just as the "inevitable effect
of a statute on its face may render it unconstitutional," a statute's stated
purposes may also be considered. Here, the Vermont Legislature explained that
detailers, in particular those who promote brand-name drugs, convey messages
that "are often in conflict with the goals of the state." The legislature designed
§4631(d) to target those speakers and their messages for disfavored treatment.
"In its practical operation," Vermont's law "goes even beyond mere content
discrimination, to actual viewpoint discrimination." Given the legislature's
expressed statement of purpose, it is apparent that §4631(d) imposes burdens
that are based on the content of speech and that are aimed at a particular
viewpoint.
Act 80 is designed to impose a specific, content-based burden on protected
expression. It follows that heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted. The Court
has recognized that the "distinction between laws burdening and laws banning
speech is but a matter of degree" and that the "Government's content-based
burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its content-based bans.
Lawmakers may no more silence unwanted speech by burdening its utterance
than by censoring its content.
The First Amendment requires heightened scrutiny whenever the government
creates "a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it
conveys. Commercial speech is no exception. A "consumer's concern for the
free flow of commercial speech often may be far keener than his concern for
urgent political dialogue." That reality has great relevance in the fields of
medicine and public health, where information can save lives.
2

Robson

767

The First Amendment

The State argues that heightened judicial scrutiny is unwarranted because its
law is a mere commercial regulation. It is true that restrictions on protected
expression are distinct from restrictions on economic activity or, more generally,
on nonexpressive conduct. It is also true that the First Amendment does not
prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct from imposing incidental
burdens on speech. That is why a ban on race-based hiring may require
employers to remove "`White Applicants Only'" signs, Rumsfeld v. Forum for
Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.; why "an ordinance against outdoor fires"
might forbid "burning a flag," R.A.V.; and why antitrust laws can prohibit
"agreements in restraint of trade," Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co.
But §4631(d) imposes more than an incidental burden on protected expression.
Both on its face and in its practical operation, Vermont's law imposes a burden
based on the content of speech and the identity of the speaker. While the
burdened speech results from an economic motive, so too does a great deal of
vital expression. Vermont's law does not simply have an effect on speech, but is
directed at certain content and is aimed at particular speakers. The
Constitution "does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics." Lochner v.
New York (Holmes, J., dissenting). It does enact the First Amendment.
Vermont further argues that § 4631(d) regulates not speech but simply access
to information. Prescriber-identifying information was generated in compliance
with a legal mandate, the State argues, and so could be considered a kind of
governmental information. *** [But] Vermont has imposed a restriction on
access to information in private hands. *** An individual's right to speak is
implicated when information he or she possesses is subjected to "restraints on
the way in which the information might be used" or disseminated. ***
The State also contends that heightened judicial scrutiny is unwarranted in this
case because sales, transfer, and use of prescriber-identifying information are
conduct, not speech. ***
This Court has held that the creation and dissemination of information are
speech within the meaning of the First Amendment. Facts, after all, are the
beginning point for much of the speech that is most essential to advance
human knowledge and to conduct human affairs. There is thus a strong
argument that prescriber-identifying information is speech for First Amendment
purposes.
The State asks for an exception to the rule that information is speech, but there
is no need to consider that request in this case. The State has imposed contentand speaker-based restrictions on the availability and use of prescriberidentifying information. So long as they do not engage in marketing, many
speakers can obtain and use the information. But detailers cannot. Vermont's
statute could be compared with a law prohibiting trade magazines from
purchasing or using ink. Like that hypothetical law, § 4631(d) imposes a
speaker- and content-based burden on protected expression, and that
circumstance is sufficient to justify application of heightened scrutiny. As a
consequence, this case can be resolved even assuming, as the State argues,
that prescriber-identifying information is a mere commodity.
B

Robson

768

The First Amendment

In the ordinary case it is all but dispositive to conclude that a law is contentbased and, in practice, viewpoint-discriminatory. The State argues that a
different analysis applies here because, assuming §4631(d) burdens speech at
all, it at most burdens only commercial speech. As in previous cases, however,
the outcome is the same whether a special commercial speech inquiry or a
stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied. For the same reason there is no
need to determine whether all speech hampered by §4631(d) is commercial, as
our cases have used that term.
Under a commercial speech inquiry, it is the State's burden to justify its
content-based law as consistent with the First Amendment. To sustain the
targeted, content-based burden §4631(d) imposes on protected expression, the
State must show at least that the statute directly advances a substantial
governmental interest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that interest.
There must be a "fit between the legislature's ends and the means chosen to
accomplish those ends." As in other contexts, these standards ensure not only
that the State's interests are proportional to the resulting burdens placed on
speech but also that the law does not seek to suppress a disfavored message.
The State's asserted justifications for §4631(d) come under two general
headings. First, the State contends that its law is necessary to protect medical
privacy, including physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment, and the
integrity of the doctor-patient relationship. Second, the State argues that
§4631(d) is integral to the achievement of policy objectives— namely, improved
public health and reduced healthcare costs. Neither justification withstands
scrutiny.
1
Vermont argues that its physicians have a "reasonable expectation" that their
prescriber-identifying information "will not be used for purposes other than. . .
filling and processing" prescriptions. It may be assumed that, for many reasons,
physicians have an interest in keeping their prescription decisions confidential.
But § 4631(d) is not drawn to serve that interest. Under Vermont's law,
pharmacies may share prescriber-identifying information with anyone for any
reason save one: They must not allow the information to be used for marketing.
Exceptions further allow pharmacies to sell prescriber-identifying information
for certain purposes, including "health care research." And the measure permits
insurers, researchers, journalists, the State itself, and others to use the
information. All but conceding that § 4631(d) does not in itself advance
confidentiality interests, the State suggests that other laws might impose
separate bars on the disclosure of prescriber-identifying information. But the
potential effectiveness of other measures cannot justify the distinctive set of
prohibitions and sanctions imposed by § 4631(d).
*** Vermont made prescriber-identifying information available to an almost
limitless audience. The explicit structure of the statute allows the information
to be studied and used by all but a narrow class of disfavored speakers. Given
the information's widespread availability and many permissible uses, the State's
asserted interest in physician confidentiality does not justify the burden that §
4631(d) places on protected expression.

Robson

769

The First Amendment

The State points out that it allows doctors to forgo the advantages of § 4631(d)
by consenting to the sale, disclosure, and use of their prescriber-identifying
information. It is true that private decisionmaking can avoid governmental
partiality and thus insulate privacy measures from First Amendment challenge.
But that principle is inapposite here. Vermont has given its doctors a contrived
choice: Either consent, which will allow your prescriber-identifying information
to be disseminated and used without constraint; or, withhold consent, which
will allow your information to be used by those speakers whose message the
State supports. Section 4631(d) may offer a limited degree of privacy, but only
on terms favorable to the speech the State prefers. This is not to say that all
privacy measures must avoid content-based rules. Here, however, the State has
conditioned privacy on acceptance of a content-based rule that is not drawn to
serve the State's asserted interest. To obtain the limited privacy allowed by §
4631(d), Vermont physicians are forced to acquiesce in the State's goal of
burdening disfavored speech by disfavored speakers.
*** Vermont's argument accordingly fails, even if the availability and scope of
private election might be relevant in other contexts, as when the statute's
design is unrelated to any purpose to advance a preferred message.
The State also contends that §4631(d) protects doctors from "harassing sales
behaviors." *** Many are those who must endure speech they do not like, but
that is a necessary cost of freedom. In any event the State offers no explanation
why remedies other than content-based rules would be inadequate. Physicians
can, and often do, simply decline to meet with detailers, including detailers who
use prescriber-identifying information. Doctors who wish to forgo detailing
altogether are free to give "No Solicitation" or "No Detailing" instructions to their
office managers or to receptionists at their places of work. Personal privacy even
in one's own home receives "ample protection" from the "resident's
unquestioned right to refuse to engage in conversation with unwelcome
visitors." A physician's office is no more private and is entitled to no greater
protection.
Vermont argues that detailers' use of prescriber-identifying information
undermines the doctor-patient relationship by allowing detailers to influence
treatment decisions. According to the State, "unwanted pressure occurs" when
doctors learn that their prescription decisions are being "monitored" by detailers.
*** Speech remains protected even when it may "stir people to action," "move
them to tears," or "inflict great pain." *** If pharmaceutical marketing affects
treatment decisions, it does so because doctors find it persuasive. Absent
circumstances far from those presented here, the fear that speech might
persuade provides no lawful basis for quieting it. Brandenburg v. Ohio.
2
The State contends that § 4631(d) advances important public policy goals by
lowering the costs of medical services and promoting public health. If
prescriber-identifying information were available for use by detailers, the State
contends, then detailing would be effective in promoting brand-name drugs that
are more expensive and less safe than generic alternatives. ***
While Vermont's stated policy goals may be proper, § 4631(d) does not advance
them in a permissible way. *** The State seeks to achieve its policy objectives

Robson

770

The First Amendment

through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by certain speakers—
that is, by diminishing detailers' ability to influence prescription decisions.
Those who seek to censor or burden free expression often assert that disfavored
speech has adverse effects. But the "fear that people would make bad decisions
if given truthful information" cannot justify content-based burdens on speech.
"The First Amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that
seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their
own good." These precepts apply with full force when the audience, in this case
prescribing physicians, consists of "sophisticated and experienced" consumers.
As Vermont's legislative findings acknowledge, the premise of § 4631(d) is that
the force of speech can justify the government's attempts to stifle it. Indeed the
State defends the law by insisting that "pharmaceutical marketing has a strong
influence on doctors' prescribing practices." This reasoning is incompatible with
the First Amendment. In an attempt to reverse a disfavored trend in public
opinion, a State could not ban campaigning with slogans, picketing with signs,
or marching during the daytime. Likewise the State may not seek to remove a
popular but disfavored product from the marketplace by prohibiting truthful,
nonmisleading advertisements that contain impressive endorsements or catchy
jingles. That the State finds expression too persuasive does not permit it to
quiet the speech or to burden its messengers.
***
The State may not burden the speech of others in order to tilt public debate in a
preferred direction. "The commercial marketplace, like other spheres of our
social and cultural life, provides a forum where ideas and information flourish.
Some of the ideas and information are vital, some of slight worth. But the
general rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the government, assess
the value of the information presented."
It is true that content-based restrictions on protected expression are sometimes
permissible, and that principle applies to commercial speech. Indeed the
government's legitimate interest in protecting consumers from "commercial
harms" explains "why commercial speech can be subject to greater
governmental regulation than noncommercial speech." ***
The State nowhere contends that detailing is false or misleading within the
meaning of this Court's First Amendment precedents. Nor does the State argue
that the provision challenged here will prevent false or misleading speech. The
State's interest in burdening the speech of detailers instead turns on nothing
more than a difference of opinion.
The capacity of technology to find and publish personal information, including
records required by the government, presents serious and unresolved issues
with respect to personal privacy and the dignity it seeks to secure. In
considering how to protect those interests, however, the State cannot engage in
content-based discrimination to advance its own side of a debate.
If Vermont's statute provided that prescriber-identifying information could not
be sold or disclosed except in narrow circumstances then the State might have
a stronger position. Here, however, the State gives possessors of the information
broad discretion and wide latitude in disclosing the information, while at the

same time restricting the information's use by some speakers and for some
purposes, even while the State itself can use the information to counter the
speech it seeks to suppress. Privacy is a concept too integral to the person and
a right too essential to freedom to allow its manipulation to support just those
ideas the government prefers.
*** The State has burdened a form of protected expression that it found too
persuasive. At the same time, the State has left unburdened those speakers
whose messages are in accord with its own views. This the State cannot do.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
JUSTICE BREYER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE GINSBURG AND JUSTICE KAGAN JOIN,
DISSENTING.
The Vermont statute before us adversely affects expression in one, and only one,
way. It deprives pharmaceutical and data-mining companies of data, collected
pursuant to the government's regulatory mandate, that could help
pharmaceutical companies create better sales messages. In my view, this effect
on expression is inextricably related to a lawful governmental effort to regulate
a commercial enterprise. The First Amendment does not require courts to apply
a special "heightened" standard of review when reviewing such an effort. And, in
any event, the statute meets the First Amendment standard this Court has
previously applied when the government seeks to regulate commercial speech.
For any or all of these reasons, the Court should uphold the statute as
constitutional.
***
A
Because many, perhaps most, activities of human beings living together in
communities take place through speech, and because speech-related risks and
offsetting justifications differ depending upon context, this Court has
distinguished for First Amendment purposes among different contexts in which
speech takes place. Thus, the First Amendment imposes tight constraints upon
government efforts to restrict, e.g., "core" political speech, while imposing looser
constraints when the government seeks to restrict, e.g., commercial speech, the
speech of its own employees, or the regulation-related speech of a firm subject
to a traditional regulatory program.
These test-related distinctions reflect the constitutional importance of
maintaining a free marketplace of ideas, a marketplace that provides access to
"social, political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas and experiences." Without
such a marketplace, the public could not freely choose a government pledged to
implement policies that reflect the people's informed will.
At the same time, our cases make clear that the First Amendment offers
considerably less protection to the maintenance of a free marketplace for goods
and services. And they also reflect the democratic importance of permitting an
elected government to implement through effective programs policy choices for
which the people's elected representatives have voted.
Thus this Court has recognized that commercial speech including advertising
has an "informational function" and is not "valueless in the marketplace of
ideas." Central Hudson. But at the same time it has applied a less than strict,
Robson

772

The First Amendment

"intermediate" First Amendment test when the government directly restricts
commercial speech. Under that test, government laws and regulations may
significantly restrict speech, as long as they also "directly advance" a
"substantial" government interest that could not "be served as well by a more
limited restriction." Central Hudson. Moreover, the Court has found that "sales
practices" that are "misleading, deceptive, or aggressive" lack the protection of
even this "intermediate" standard. And the Court has emphasized the need, in
applying an "intermediate" test, to maintain the "`commonsense' distinction
between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area
traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech."
The Court has also normally applied a yet more lenient approach to ordinary
commercial or regulatory legislation that affects speech in less direct ways. In
doing so, the Court has taken account of the need in this area of law to defer
significantly to legislative judgment—as the Court has done in cases involving
the Commerce Clause or the Due Process Clause. ***
To apply a strict First Amendment standard virtually as a matter of course
when a court reviews ordinary economic regulatory programs (even if that
program has a modest impact upon a firm's ability to shape a commercial
message) would work at cross-purposes with this more basic constitutional
approach. Since ordinary regulatory programs can affect speech, particularly
commercial speech, in myriad ways, to apply a "heightened" First Amendment
standard of review whenever such a program burdens speech would transfer
from legislatures to judges the primary power to weigh ends and to choose
means, threatening to distort or undermine legitimate legislative objectives. To
apply a "heightened" standard of review in such cases as a matter of course
would risk what then-Justice Rehnquist, dissenting in Central Hudson,
described as a "retur[n] to the bygone era of Lochner v. New York, in which it
was common practice for this Court to strike down economic regulations
adopted by a State based on the Court's own notions of the most appropriate
means for the State to implement its considered policies."
B
There are several reasons why the Court should review Vermont's law "under
the standard appropriate for the review of economic regulation," not "under a
heightened standard appropriate for the review of First Amendment issues."
For one thing, Vermont's statute neither forbids nor requires anyone to say
anything, to engage in any form of symbolic speech, or to endorse any
particular point of view, whether ideological or related to the sale of a product.
For another thing, the same First Amendment standards that apply to Vermont
here would apply to similar regulatory actions taken by other States or by the
Federal Government acting, for example, through Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regulation. ***
Further, the statute's requirements form part of a traditional, comprehensive
regulatory regime. The pharmaceutical drug industry has been heavily
regulated at least since 1906. Longstanding statutes and regulations require
pharmaceutical companies to engage in complex drug testing to ensure that
their drugs are both "safe" and "effective." Only then can the drugs be marketed,
at which point drug companies are subject to the FDA's exhaustive regulation of

Robson

773

The First Amendment

the content of drug labels and the manner in which drugs can be advertised
and sold.
Finally, Vermont's statute is directed toward information that exists only by
virtue of government regulation. Under federal law, certain drugs can be
dispensed only by a pharmacist operating under the orders of a medical
practitioner.
Vermont regulates the qualifications, the fitness, and the
practices of pharmacists themselves, and requires pharmacies to maintain a
"patient record system" that, among other things, tracks who prescribed which
drugs. But for these regulations, pharmacies would have no way to know who
had told customers to buy which drugs (as is the case when a doctor tells a
patient to take a daily dose of aspirin).
Regulators will often find it necessary to create tailored restrictions on the use
of information subject to their regulatory jurisdiction. ***
Such regulatory actions are subject to judicial review, e.g., for compliance with
applicable statutes. And they would normally be subject to review under the
Administrative Procedure Act to make certain they are not "arbitrary, capricious,
[or] an abuse of discretion." In an appropriate case, such review might be
informed by First Amendment considerations. But regulatory actions of the
kind present here have not previously been thought to raise serious additional
constitutional concerns under the First Amendment. ***
Thus, it is not surprising that, until today, this Court has never found that the
First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting the use of
information gathered pursuant to a regulatory mandate—whether the
information rests in government files or has remained in the hands of the
private firms that gathered it. Nor has this Court ever previously applied any
form of "heightened" scrutiny in any even roughly similar case.
C
Regulatory programs necessarily draw distinctions on the basis of content.
Electricity
regulators,
for
example,
oversee
company
statements,
pronouncements, and proposals, but only about electricity. The Federal Reserve
Board regulates the content of statements, advertising, loan proposals, and
interest rate disclosures, but only when made by financial institutions. And the
FDA oversees the form and content of labeling, advertising, and sales proposals
of drugs, but not of furniture. Given the ubiquity of content-based regulatory
categories, why should the "content-based" nature of typical regulation require
courts (other things being equal) to grant legislators and regulators less
deference?
Nor, in the context of a regulatory program, is it unusual for particular rules to
be "speaker-based," affecting only a class of entities, namely, the regulated
firms. An energy regulator, for example, might require the manufacturers of
home appliances to publicize ways to reduce energy consumption, while
exempting producers of industrial equipment. Or a trade regulator might forbid
a particular firm to make the true claim that its cosmetic product contains
"cleansing grains that scrub away dirt and excess oil" unless it substantiates
that claim with detailed backup testing, even though opponents of cosmetics
use need not substantiate their claims. Or the FDA might control in detail just
what a pharmaceutical firm can, and cannot, tell potential purchasers about its

Robson

774

The First Amendment

products. Such a firm, for example, could not suggest to a potential purchaser
(say, a doctor) that he or she might put a pharmaceutical drug to an "off label"
use, even if the manufacturer, in good faith and with considerable evidence,
believes the drug will help. All the while, a third party (say, a researcher) is free
to tell the doctor not to use the drug for that purpose.
***
This does not mean that economic regulation having some effect on speech is
always lawful. Courts typically review the lawfulness of statutes for rationality
and of regulations (if federal) to make certain they are not "arbitrary, capricious,
[or] an abuse of discretion." And our valuable free-speech tradition may play an
important role in such review. But courts do not normally view these matters as
requiring "heightened" First Amendment scrutiny—and particularly not the
unforgiving brand of "intermediate" scrutiny employed by the majority. Because
the imposition of "heightened" scrutiny in such instances would significantly
change the legislative/judicial balance, in a way that would significantly
weaken the legislature's authority to regulate commerce and industry, I would
not apply a "heightened" First Amendment standard of review in this case.
III
Turning to the constitutional merits, I believe Vermont's statute survives
application of Central Hudson's "intermediate" commercial speech standard as
well as any more limited "economic regulation" test.
A
*** The upshot is that the only commercial-speech-related harm that the record
shows this statute to have brought about is the one I have previously described:
The withholding of information collected through a regulatory program, thereby
preventing companies from shaping a commercial message they believe
maximally effective. The absence of precedent suggesting that this kind of harm
is serious reinforces the conclusion that the harm here is modest at most.
B
The legitimate state interests that the statute serves are "substantial." Central
Hudson. *** [The statute’s] objectives are important. And the interests they
embody all are "neutral" in respect to speech.
The protection of public health falls within the traditional scope of a State's
police powers. The fact that the Court normally exempts the regulation of
"misleading" and "deceptive" information even from the rigors of its
"intermediate" commercial speech scrutiny testifies to the importance of
securing "unbiased information," as does the fact that the FDA sets forth as a
federal regulatory goal the need to ensure a "fair balance" of information about
marketed drugs. As major payers in the health care system, health care
spending is also of crucial state interest. And this Court has affirmed the
importance of maintaining "privacy" as an important public policy goal—even in
respect to information already disclosed to the public for particular purposes
(but not others).
At the same time, the record evidence is sufficient to permit a legislature to
conclude that the statute "directly advances" each of these objectives. The
statute helps to focus sales discussions on an individual drug's safety,
effectiveness, and cost, perhaps compared to other drugs (including generics).

Robson

775

The First Amendment

These drug-related facts have everything to do with general information that
drug manufacturers likely possess. They have little, if anything, to do with the
name or prior prescription practices of the particular doctor to whom a detailer
is speaking. Shaping a detailing message based on an individual doctor's prior
prescription habits may help sell more of a particular manufacturer's particular
drugs. But it does so by diverting attention from scientific research about a
drug's safety and effectiveness, as well as its cost. This diversion comes at the
expense of public health and the State's fiscal interests.
Vermont compiled a substantial legislative record to corroborate this line of
reasoning. ***
C
The majority cannot point to any adequately supported, similarly effective "more
limited restriction." Central Hudson. It says that doctors "can, and often do,
simply decline to meet with detailers." This fact, while true, is beside the point.
Closing the office door entirely has no similar tendency to lower costs (by
focusing greater attention upon the comparative advantages and disadvantages
of generic drug alternatives). And it would not protect the confidentiality of
information already released to, say, data miners. In any event, physicians are
unlikely to turn detailers away at the door, for those detailers, whether
delivering a balanced or imbalanced message, are nonetheless providers of
much useful information. Forcing doctors to choose between targeted detailing
and no detailing at all could therefore jeopardize the State's interest in
promoting public health.
*** Respondents' alternatives are no more helpful. Respondents suggest that
"Vermont can simply inform physicians that pharmaceutical companies . . . use
prescription history information to communicate with doctors." But how would
that help serve the State's basic purposes? It would not create the "fair balance"
of information in pharmaceutical marketing that the State, like the FDA, seeks.
Respondents also suggest policies requiring use of generic drugs or educating
doctors about their benefits. Such programs have been in effect for some time
in Vermont or other States, without indication that they have prevented the
imbalanced sales tactics at which Vermont's statute takes aim. And in any
event, such laws do not help protect prescriber privacy.
Vermont has thus developed a record that sufficiently shows that its statute
meaningfully furthers substantial state interests. Neither the majority nor
respondents suggests any equally effective “more limited” restriction. And the
First Amendment harm that Vermont’s statute works is, at most, modest. I
consequently conclude that, even if we apply an “intermediate” test such as that
in Central Hudson, this statute is constitutional.
IV
What about the statute’s third restriction, providing that “[p]harmaceutical
manufacturers and pharmaceutical marketers” may not “use prescriberidentifiable information for marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless
the prescriber consents”? In principle, I should not reach this question. That is
because respondent pharmaceutical manufacturers, marketers, and data
miners seek a declaratory judgment and injunction prohibiting the enforcement
of this statute. And they have neither shown nor claimed that they could obtain

Robson

776

The First Amendment

significant amounts of “prescriber-identifiable information” if the first two
prohibitions are valid. If, as I believe, the first two statutory prohibitions (related
to selling and disclosing the information) are valid, then the dispute about the
validity of the third provision is not “‘real and substantial’” or “‘definite and
concrete.’” (Article III does not permit courts to entertain such disputes).
The Court, however, strikes down all three provisions, and so I add that I
disagree with the majority as to the constitutionality of the third restriction as
well—basically for the reasons I have already set out. The prohibition against
pharmaceutical firms using this prescriber- identifying information works no
more than modest First Amendment harm; the prohibition is justified by the
need to ensure unbiased sales presentations, prevent unnecessarily high drug
costs, and protect the privacy of prescribing physicians. There is no obvious
equally effective, more limited alternative.
V
In sum, I believe that the statute before us satisfies the "intermediate"
standards this Court has applied to restrictions on commercial speech. A fortiori
it satisfies less demanding standards that are more appropriately applied in this
kind of commercial regulatory case—a case where the government seeks typical
regulatory ends (lower drug prices, more balanced sales messages) through the
use of ordinary regulatory means (limiting the commercial use of data gathered
pursuant to a regulatory mandate). The speech-related consequences here are
indirect, incidental, and entirely commercial.
The Court reaches its conclusion through the use of important First
Amendment categories—"content-based," "speaker-based," and "neutral"—but
without taking full account of the regulatory context, the nature of the speech
effects, the values these First Amendment categories seek to promote, and prior
precedent. At best the Court opens a Pandora's Box of First Amendment
challenges to many ordinary regulatory practices that may only incidentally
affect a commercial message. At worst, it reawakens Lochner's pre-New Deal
threat of substituting judicial for democratic decisionmaking where ordinary
economic regulation is at issue. See Central Hudson (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).
Regardless, whether we apply an ordinary commercial speech standard or a less
demanding standard, I believe Vermont’s law is consistent with the First
Amendment. And with respect, I dissent.

Notes	  
1.
Do you agree with the 6-3 decision in Sorrell v. IMS Health? Is
there a limiting principle or does it have the potential, as the dissenting
opinion argues, to open a “Pandora’s Box” of regulation?
2.
Consider the Third Circuit’s opinion in King v. Governor of the
State of New Jersey, 767 F.3d 216, (3d Cir. 2014), upholding a New
Jersey statute, A3371, that prohibits licensed counselors from engaging

Robson

777

The First Amendment

in “sexual orientation change efforts” (SOCE), also often called sexual
conversion therapy, with a client under the age of 18.
The court found Sorrell v. IMS Health inapplicable:
We reject Plaintiffs' argument that A3371 should be subject to strict scrutiny
because it discriminates on the basis of content and viewpoint. First, although
we agree with Plaintiffs that A3371 discriminates on the basis of content, it does
so in a way that does not trigger strict scrutiny. Ordinarily, content-based
regulations are highly disfavored and subjected to strict scrutiny. See Sorrell v.
IMS Health, Inc., (2011). And this is generally true even when the law in question
regulates unprotected or lesser protected speech. See R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul
(1992). Nonetheless, within these unprotected or lesser protected categories of
speech, the Supreme Court has held that a statute does not trigger strict
scrutiny “[w]hen the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the
very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable.” By way of
illustration, the Court [in R.A.V.] explained:
[A] State may choose to regulate price advertising in one industry but not
in others, because the risk of fraud (one of the characteristics of
commercial speech that justifies depriving it of full First Amendment
protection) is in its view greater there. But a State may not prohibit only
that commercial advertising that depicts men in a demeaning fashion.
A3371 fits comfortably within this category of permissible content discrimination.
As with the content-based regulations identified by R.A.V. as permissible, “the
basis for [A3371's] content discrimination consists entirely of the very reason”
professional speech is a category of lesser-protected speech. The New Jersey
legislature has targeted SOCE counseling for prohibition because it was
presented with evidence that this particular form of counseling is ineffective and
potentially harmful to clients. Thus, the reason professional speech receives
diminished protection under the First Amendment—i.e., because of the State's
longstanding authority to protect its citizens from ineffective or harmful
professional practices—is precisely the reason New Jersey targeted SOCE
counseling with A3371. Therefore, we conclude that A3371 does not trigger
strict scrutiny by discriminating on the basis of content in an impermissible
manner.

Could the Court have accepted a similar argument in Sorrell v. IMS
Health itself?
3.
In many of the commercial speech cases, especially those
concerning advertisements directed at children, the Court cites cases
involving sexual speech. The next Chapter turns to the subject of sexual
speech under the First Amendment.

161 U.S. 29 (1896)

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The plaintiff in error was indicted under section 3893 of the Revised Statutes,
providing that 'every obscene, lewd, or lascivious book, pamphlet, picture,
paper, writing, print, or other publication of an indecent character, . . . and
every article or thing intended or adapted for any indecent or immoral use, and
every written or printed card, circular, book, pamphlet, advertisement, or notice
of any kind giving information, directly or indirectly, where or how, or of whom,
or by what means, any of the hereinbefore mentioned matters, articies, or
things may be obtained or made, . . . are hereby declared to be nonmailable
matter, and shall not be conveyed in the mails, nor delivered from any post
office nor by any letter carrier; and any person who shall knowingly deposit, or
cause to be deposited, for mailing or delivery, anything declared by this section
to be non-mailable matter, and any person who shall knowingly take the same,
or cause the same to be taken, from the mails, for the purpose of circulating, or
disposing of, or of aiding in the circulation or disposition of the same, shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall for each and every offense be fined
not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, or
imprisoned at hard labor not less than one year nor more than ten years, or
both, at the discretion of the court. . . . [ellipses in original]
The defendant pleaded not guilty, and the trial was entered upon without
objection in any form to the indictment as not sufficiently informing the
defendant of the nature of the charge against him.
A verdict of guilty having been returned, the accused moved for a new trial,
upon the ground, among others, that the indictment was fatally defective in
matters of substance. That motion was denied.
The defendant thereupon moved in arrest of judgment, upon the ground that
the indictment did not charge that he knew at the time what were the contents
of the paper deposited in the mail, and alleged to be lewd, obscene, and
lascivious. This motion was also denied, and the accused was sentenced to
imprisonment at hard labor during a period of 13 months, and to pay a fine of
one dollar.
The paper 'Broadway,' referred to in the indictment, was produced in evidence,
first, by the United States, and afterwards by the accused. The copy read in
evidence by the government was the one which, it was admitted at the trial, the
defendant had caused to be deposited in the mail. The pictures of females
appearing in that copy were, by direction of the defendant, partially covered
with lamp black, that could be easily erased with a piece of bread. The object of
sending them out in that condition was, of course, to excite a curiosity to know
what was thus concealed. The accused read in evidence a copy that he

Robson

780

The First Amendment

characterized as a 'clean' one, and in which the pictures of females, in different
attitudes of indecency, were not obscured by lamp black.
*** The indictment charged that the accused, on the 24th day of April, 1893,
within the Southern district of New York, 'did unlawfully, willfully, and
knowingly deposit and cause to be deposited in the post office of the city of New
York, for mailing and delivery by the post-office establishment of the United
States, a certain obscene, lewd, and lascivious paper, which said paper then
and there, on the first page thereof, was entitled 'Tenderloin Number,
Broadway,' and on the same page were printed the words and figures following,
that is to say: 'Volume II, number 27; trade-mark, 1892; by Lew Rosen; New
York, Saturday, April 15, 1893; ten cents a copy, $4.00 a year in advance;' and
thereupon, on the same page, is the picture of a cab, horse, driver, and the
figure of a female, together (underneath the said picture) with the word
'Tenderloineuse'; and the said paper consists of twelve pages, minute
description of which, with the pictures therein and thereon, would be offensive
to the court, and improper to spread upon the records of the court, because of
their obscene, lewd, and indecent matters; and the said paper, on the said
twenty-fourth day of April, in the year one thousand eight hundred and ninetythree, was inclosed in a wrapper, and addressed as follows, that is to say: 'Mr.
Geo. Edwards, P. O. box 510, Summit, N. J.,'—against the peace of the United
States and their dignity, and contrary to the statute of the United States in
such case made and provided.'
*** It is also assigned for error that the court left it to the jury to say whether
the paper in question was obscene, when it was for the court, as a matter of law,
to determine that question. If the court had instructed the jury as matter of law
that the paper described in the indictment was obscene, lewd, and lascivious,
no error would have been committed; for the paper itself was in evidence, it was
of the class excluded from the mails, and there was no dispute as to its
contents. It has long been the settled doctrine of this court that the evidence
before the jury, if clear and uncontradicted upon any issue made by the parties,
presented a question of law in respect of which the court could, without
usurping the functions of the jury, instruct them as to the principles applicable
to the case made by such evidence. Even if we should hold that the court ought
to have instructed the jury, as matter of law, that the paper was, within the
meaning of the statute, obscene, lewd, and lascivious, it would not follow that
the judgment should, for that reason, be reversed, because it is clear that no
injury came to the defendant by submitting the question of the character of the
paper to the jury. But it is proper to add that it was competent for the court
below, in its discretion, and even if it had been inclined to regard the paper as
obscene, lewd, and lascivious, to submit to the jury the general question of the
nature of the paper, accompanied by instructions indicating the principles or
rules by which they should be guided in determining what was an obscene,
lewd, or lascivious paper within the contemplation of the statute under which
the indictment was framed. That was what the court did when it charged the
jury that 'the test of obscenity is whether the tendency of the matter is to
deprave and corrupt the morals of those whose minds are open to such
influence, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.' 'Would it,'
the court said, 'suggest or convey lewd thoughts and lascivious thoughts to the
young and inexperienced?' In view of the character of the paper, as an

Robson

781

The First Amendment

inspection of it will instantly disclose, the test prescribed for the jury was quite
as liberal as the defendant had any right to demand.
Other questions are discussed in the elaborate brief filed for the defendant.
Some of them do not require notice; other were not sufficiently saved by
exceptions, at the proper time, and will not therefore be considered or
determined.
We find no error of law in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, WITH WHOM CONCURRED MR. JUSTICE SHIRAS, DISSENTING.
[opinion omitted]

Notes	  
1.
Adoption of the “test” for obscenity in the jury instructions as
derived from Regina v. Hicklin, [1868] LR 3 QB 360, which the Court does
not cite. Chief Justice Cockburn in Hicklin stated:
the test of obscenity is this, whether the tendency of the matter charged
as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to
such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort
may fall. Now, with regard to this work, it is quite certain that it would
suggest to the minds of the young of either sex, or even to persons of
more advanced years, thoughts of a most impure and libidinous
character.

2.
In both Regina v. Hicklin and Rosen v. United States, the central
issues are centered on the defendant’s requisite knowledge regarding the
obscenity rather than the definition of obscenity itself.
3.
Obscenity laws often criminalized the burgeoning birth control,
reproductive rights, and women’s movements. Perhaps most famously,
“An Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of Obscene
Literature and Articles of Immoral Use,” known as The Comstock Act, 42
Cong. Ch. 258, 17 Stat. 598 (1873) (repealed 1909), prohibited any
person from selling or distributing in U.S. mail articles used “for the
prevention of conception, or for causing unlawful abortion” and defined
sending information concerning these practices as “obscene.” While the
bill originally contained a physician-exemption, the Act as passed deleted
this exemption. State and local legislatures passed their own Comstock
acts, not requiring use of the mails. The Comstock acts took their name
from Anthony Comstock, an anti-vice crusader supported by millionaires
such as J.P. Morgan and Samuel Colgate. Comstock began an antisaloon movement in Brooklyn, later created and led the infamous New
York Society for the Suppression of Vice, and was appointed a special
postal inspector.

Roth	  v.	  United	  States	  
[consolidated with Alberts v. California]

354 U.S. 476 (1957)

BRENNAN, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH FRANKFURTER, BURTON, CLARK,
WHITTAKER, J.J., JOINED. WARREN, C.J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION. HARLAN, J., FILED A
DISSENTING OPINION. DOUGLAS, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION IN WHICH BLACK, J., JOINED.

JUSTICE BRENNAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The constitutionality of a criminal obscenity statute is the question in each of
these cases. In Roth, the primary constitutional question is whether the federal
obscenity statute violates the provision of the First Amendment that "Congress
shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press . . . ." In
Alberts, the primary constitutional question is whether the obscenity provisions
of the California Penal Code invade the freedoms of speech and press as they
may be incorporated in the liberty protected from state action by the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Other constitutional questions are: whether these statutes violate due process,
because too vague to support conviction for crime; whether power to punish
speech and press offensive to decency and morality is in the States alone, so
that the federal obscenity statute violates the Ninth and Tenth Amendments
(raised in Roth); and whether Congress, by enacting the federal obscenity
statute, under the power delegated by Art. I, § 8, cl. 7, to establish post offices
and post roads, pre-empted the regulation of the subject matter (raised in
Alberts).
Roth conducted a business in New York in the publication and sale of books,
photographs and magazines. He used circulars and advertising matter to solicit
sales. He was convicted by a jury in the District Court for the Southern District
of New York upon 4 counts of a 26-count indictment charging him with mailing
obscene circulars and advertising, and an obscene book, in violation of the
federal obscenity statute. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit. We granted certiorari.
Alberts conducted a mail-order business from Los Angeles. He was convicted by
the Judge of the Municipal Court of the Beverly Hills Judicial District (having
waived a jury trial) under a misdemeanor complaint which charged him with
lewdly keeping for sale obscene and indecent books, and with writing,
composing and publishing an obscene advertisement of them, in violation of the
California Penal Code. The conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Department
of the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Los
Angeles. We noted probable jurisdiction.
The dispositive question is whether obscenity is utterance within the area of
protected speech and press. Although this is the first time the question has
been squarely presented to this Court, either under the First Amendment or
under the Fourteenth Amendment, expressions found in numerous opinions
indicate that this Court has always assumed that obscenity is not protected by
the freedoms of speech and press.

Robson

783

The First Amendment

The guaranties of freedom of expression in effect in 10 of the 14 States which by
1792 had ratified the Constitution, gave no absolute protection for every
utterance. Thirteen of the 14 States provided for the prosecution of libel, and all
of those States made either blasphemy or profanity, or both, statutory crimes.
As early as 1712, Massachusetts made it criminal to publish "any filthy,
obscene, or profane song, pamphlet, libel or mock sermon" in imitation or
mimicking of religious services. Acts and Laws of the Province of Mass. Bay, c.
CV, § 8 (1712), Mass. Bay Colony Charters & Laws 399 (1814). Thus, profanity
and obscenity were related offenses.
In light of this history, it is apparent that the unconditional phrasing of the
First Amendment was not intended to protect every utterance. This phrasing
did not prevent this Court from concluding that libelous utterances are not
within the area of constitutionally protected speech. Beauharnais v. Illinois
(1952). At the time of the adoption of the First Amendment, obscenity law was
not as fully developed as libel law, but there is sufficiently contemporaneous
evidence to show that obscenity, too, was outside the protection intended for
speech and press.
The protection given speech and press was fashioned to assure unfettered
interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes
desired by the people. This objective was made explicit as early as 1774 in a
letter of the Continental Congress to the inhabitants of Quebec:
"The last right we shall mention, regards the freedom of the press. The
importance of this consists, besides the advancement of truth, science, morality,
and arts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on the administration of
Government, its ready communication of thoughts between subjects, and its
consequential promotion of union among them, whereby oppressive officers are
shamed or intimidated, into more honourable and just modes of conducting
affairs." 1 Journals of the Continental Congress 108 (1774).

All ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance—unorthodox
ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of
opinion—have the full protection of the guaranties, unless excludable because
they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests. But implicit in
the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly
without redeeming social importance. This rejection for that reason is mirrored
in the universal judgment that obscenity should be restrained, reflected in the
international agreement of over 50 nations, in the obscenity laws of all of the 48
States, and in the 20 obscenity laws enacted by the Congress from 1842 to
1956. This is the same judgment expressed by this Court in Chaplinsky v. New
Hampshire (1942):
". . . There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the
prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any
Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene . . . . It has been
well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas,
and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be
derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and
morality. . . ." (Emphasis added.)

The First Amendment

We hold that obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected
speech or press.
It is strenuously urged that these obscenity statutes offend the constitutional
guaranties because they punish incitation to impure sexual thoughts, not
shown to be related to any overt antisocial conduct which is or may be incited
in the persons stimulated to such thoughts. In Roth, the trial judge instructed
the jury: "The words `obscene, lewd and lascivious' as used in the law, signify
that form of immorality which has relation to sexual impurity and has a
tendency to excite lustful thoughts." (Emphasis added.) ***
However, sex and obscenity are not synonymous. Obscene material is material
which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest. The portrayal
of sex, e. g., in art, literature and scientific works, is not itself sufficient reason
to deny material the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and press.
Sex, a great and mysterious motive force in human life, has indisputably been a
subject of absorbing interest to mankind through the ages; it is one of the vital
problems of human interest and public concern. As to all such problems, this
Court said in Thornhill v. Alabama (1940):
"The freedom of speech and of the press guaranteed by the Constitution
embraces at the least the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of
public concern without previous restraint or fear of subsequent punishment. The
exigencies of the colonial period and the efforts to secure freedom from
oppressive administration developed a broadened conception of these liberties as
adequate to supply the public need for information and education with respect to
the significant issues of the times. . . . Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its
historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information
is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the
exigencies of their period." (Emphasis added.)

The fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the
development and well-being of our free society and are indispensable to its
continued growth. Ceaseless vigilance is the watchword to prevent their erosion
by Congress or by the States. The door barring federal and state intrusion into
this area cannot be left ajar; it must be kept tightly closed and opened only the
slightest crack necessary to prevent encroachment upon more important
interests. It is therefore vital that the standards for judging obscenity safeguard
the protection of freedom of speech and press for material which does not treat
sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest.
The early leading standard of obscenity allowed material to be judged merely by
the effect of an isolated excerpt upon particularly susceptible persons. Regina
v.Hicklin, [1868] L. R. 3 Q. B. 360. Some American courts adopted this
standard but later decisions have rejected it and substituted this test: whether
to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the
dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.
The Hicklin test, judging obscenity by the effect of isolated passages upon the
most susceptible persons, might well encompass material legitimately treating
with sex, and so it must be rejected as unconstitutionally restrictive of the
freedoms of speech and press. On the other hand, the substituted standard
provides safeguards adequate to withstand the charge of constitutional infirmity.

Robson

785

The First Amendment

Both trial courts below sufficiently followed the proper standard. Both courts
used the proper definition of obscenity. In addition, in the Alberts case, in ruling
on a motion to dismiss, the trial judge indicated that, as the trier of facts, he
was judging each item as a whole as it would affect the normal person, and in
Roth, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:
". . . The test is not whether it would arouse sexual desires or sexual impure
thoughts in those comprising a particular segment of the community, the young,
the immature or the highly prudish or would leave another segment, the
scientific or highly educated or the so-called worldly-wise and sophisticated
indifferent and unmoved. . . .
"The test in each case is the effect of the book, picture or publication considered
as a whole, not upon any particular class, but upon all those whom it is likely to
reach. In other words, you determine its impact upon the average person in the
community. The books, pictures and circulars must be judged as a whole, in
their entire context, and you are not to consider detached or separate portions
in reaching a conclusion. You judge the circulars, pictures and publications
which have been put in evidence by present-day standards of the community.
You may ask yourselves does it offend the common conscience of the community
by present-day standards. . . .
"In this case, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you and you alone are the
exclusive judges of what the common conscience of the community is, and in
determining that conscience you are to consider the community as a whole,
young and old, educated and uneducated, the religious and the irreligious—men,
women and children."

It is argued that the statutes do not provide reasonably ascertainable standards
of guilt and therefore violate the constitutional requirements of due process. ***
The thrust of the argument is that these words are not sufficiently precise
because they do not mean the same thing to all people, all the time, everywhere.
Many decisions have recognized that these terms of obscenity statutes are not
precise. This Court, however, has consistently held that lack of precision is not
itself offensive to the requirements of due process. ". . . [T]he Constitution does
not require impossible standards"; all that is required is that the language
"conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when
measured by common understanding and practices. . . ." ***
In summary, then, we hold that these statutes, applied according to the proper
standard for judging obscenity, do not offend constitutional safeguards against
convictions based upon protected material, or fail to give men in acting
adequate notice of what is prohibited.
Roth's argument that the federal obscenity statute unconstitutionally
encroaches upon the powers reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to
the States and to the people to punish speech and press where offensive to
decency and morality is hinged upon his contention that obscenity is
expression not excepted from the sweep of the provision of the First Amendment
that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press . . . ." (Emphasis added.) That argument falls in light of our holding that
obscenity is not expression protected by the First Amendment. We therefore
hold that the federal obscenity statute punishing the use of the mails for

Robson

786

The First Amendment

obscene material is a proper exercise of the postal power delegated to Congress
by Art. I, § 8, cl. 7. ***
[Alberts’ argument that because his was a mail-order business, the California
statute is repugnant to Art. I, § 8, cl. 7, under which the Congress allegedly preempted the regulatory field by enacting the federal obscenity statute punishing
the mailing or advertising by mail of obscene material was rejected].
The judgments are
Affirmed.
CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, CONCURRING IN THE RESULT.
I agree with the result reached by the Court in these cases, but, because we are
operating in a field of expression and because broad language used here may
eventually be applied to the arts and sciences and freedom of communication
generally, I would limit our decision to the facts before us and to the validity of
the statutes in question as applied.
*** That there is a social problem presented by obscenity is attested by the
expression of the legislatures of the forty-eight States as well as the Congress.
To recognize the existence of a problem, however, does not require that we
sustain any and all measures adopted to meet that problem. The history of the
application of laws designed to suppress the obscene demonstrates convincingly
that the power of government can be invoked under them against great art or
literature, scientific treatises, or works exciting social controversy. Mistakes of
the past prove that there is a strong countervailing interest to be considered in
the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
The line dividing the salacious or pornographic from literature or science is not
straight and unwavering. Present laws depend largely upon the effect that the
materials may have upon those who receive them. It is manifest that the same
object may have a different impact, varying according to the part of the
community it reached. But there is more to these cases. It is not the book that
is on trial; it is a person. The conduct of the defendant is the central issue, not
the obscenity of a book or picture. The nature of the materials is, of course,
relevant as an attribute of the defendant's conduct, but the materials are thus
placed in context from which they draw color and character. A wholly different
result might be reached in a different setting.
*** The defendants in both these cases were engaged in the business of
purveying textual or graphic matter openly advertised to appeal to the erotic
interest of their customers. They were plainly engaged in the commercial
exploitation of the morbid and shameful craving for materials with prurient
effect. I believe that the State and Federal Governments can constitutionally
punish such conduct. That is all that these cases present to us, and that is all
we need to decide.
I agree with the Court's decision in its rejection of the other contentions raised
by these defendants.

Robson

The First Amendment

JUSTICE HARLAN, CONCURRING IN THE RESULT IN NO. 61, AND DISSENTING IN NO. 582.
I regret not to be able to join the Court's opinion. I cannot do so because I find
lurking beneath its disarming generalizations a number of problems which not
only leave me with serious misgivings as to the future effect of today's decisions,
but which also, in my view, call for different results in these two cases.
I.
My basic difficulties with the Court's opinion are threefold. First, the opinion
paints with such a broad brush that I fear it may result in a loosening of the
tight reins which state and federal courts should hold upon the enforcement of
obscenity statutes. Second, the Court fails to discriminate between the different
factors which, in my opinion, are involved in the constitutional adjudication of
state and federal obscenity cases. Third, relevant distinctions between the two
obscenity statutes here involved, and the Court's own definition of "obscenity,"
are ignored.
In final analysis, the problem presented by these cases is how far, and on what
terms, the state and federal governments have power to punish individuals for
disseminating books considered to be undesirable because of their nature or
supposed deleterious effect upon human conduct. Proceeding from the premise
that "no issue is presented in either case, concerning the obscenity of the
material involved," the Court finds the "dispositive question" to be "whether
obscenity is utterance within the area of protected speech and press," and then
holds that "obscenity" is not so protected because it is "utterly without
redeeming social importance." This sweeping formula appears to me to beg the
very question before us. The Court seems to assume that "obscenity" is a
peculiar genus of "speech and press," which is as distinct, recognizable, and
classifiable as poison ivy is among other plants. On this basis the constitutional
question before us simply becomes, as the Court says, whether "obscenity," as
an abstraction, is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and the
question whether a particular book may be suppressed becomes a mere matter
of classification, of "fact," to be entrusted to a fact-finder and insulated from
independent constitutional judgment. But surely the problem cannot be solved
in such a generalized fashion. Every communication has an individuality and
"value" of its own. The suppression of a particular writing or other tangible form
of expression is, therefore, an individual matter, and in the nature of things
every such suppression raises an individual constitutional problem, in which a
reviewing court must determine for itself whether the attacked expression is
suppressable within constitutional standards. Since those standards do not
readily lend themselves to generalized definitions, the constitutional problem in
the last analysis becomes one of particularized judgments which appellate
courts must make for themselves.
I do not think that reviewing courts can escape this responsibility by saying
that the trier of the facts, be it a jury or a judge, has labeled the questioned
matter as "obscene," for, if "obscenity" is to be suppressed, the question
whether a particular work is of that character involves not really an issue of fact
but a question of constitutional judgment of the most sensitive and delicate kind.
Many juries might find that Joyce's "Ulysses" or Bocaccio's "Decameron" was
obscene, and yet the conviction of a defendant for selling either book would
raise, for me, the gravest constitutional problems, for no such verdict could

Robson

788

The First Amendment

convince me, without more, that these books are "utterly without redeeming
social importance." In short, I do not understand how the Court can resolve the
constitutional problems now before it without making its own independent
judgment upon the character of the material upon which these convictions were
based. I am very much afraid that the broad manner in which the Court has
decided these cases will tend to obscure the peculiar responsibilities resting on
state and federal courts in this field and encourage them to rely on easy
labeling and jury verdicts as a substitute for facing up to the tough individual
problems of constitutional judgment involved in every obscenity case.
My second reason for dissatisfaction with the Court's opinion is that the broad
strides with which the Court has proceeded has led it to brush aside with
perfunctory ease the vital constitutional considerations which, in my opinion,
differentiate these two cases. It does not seem to matter to the Court that in one
case we balance the power of a State in this field against the restrictions of the
Fourteenth Amendment, and in the other the power of the Federal Government
against the limitations of the First Amendment. I deal with this subject more
particularly later.
Thirdly, the Court has not been bothered by the fact that the two cases involve
different statutes. In California the book must have a "tendency to deprave or
corrupt its readers"; under the federal statute it must tend "to stir sexual
impulses and lead to sexually impure thoughts." The two statutes do not seem
to me to present the same problems. Yet the Court compounds confusion when
it superimposes on these two statutory definitions a third, drawn from the
American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft No. 6: "A thing is
obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient
interest." The bland assurance that this definition is the same as the ones with
which we deal flies in the face of the authors' express rejection of the "deprave
and corrupt" and "sexual thoughts" tests:
"Obscenity [in the Tentative Draft] is defined in terms of material which appeals
predominantly to prurient interest in sexual matters and which goes beyond
customary freedom of expression in these matters. We reject the prevailing test
of tendency to arouse lustful thoughts or desires because it is unrealistically
broad for a society that plainly tolerates a great deal of erotic interest in
literature, advertising, and art, and because regulation of thought or desire,
unconnected with overt misbehavior, raises the most acute constitutional as
well as practical difficulties. We likewise reject the common definition of obscene
as that which `tends to corrupt or debase.' If this means anything different from
tendency to arouse lustful thought and desire, it suggests that change of
character or actual misbehavior follows from contact with obscenity. Evidence of
such consequences is lacking . . . . On the other hand, `appeal to prurient
interest' refers to qualities of the material itself: the capacity to attract
individuals eager for a forbidden look . . . ."

As this passage makes clear, there is a significant distinction between the
definitions used in the prosecutions before us, and the American Law Institute
formula. If, therefore, the latter is the correct standard, as my Brother Brennan
elsewhere intimates, then these convictions should surely be reversed. Instead,
the Court merely assimilates the various tests into one indiscriminate potpourri.
I now pass to the consideration of the two cases before us.

Robson

The First Amendment

II
[concur in the judgment of the Court in No. 61, Alberts v. California.]
III
[dissent in No. 582, Roth v. United States]
*** The substantive powers of the two governments, in many instances, are
distinct. And in every case where we are called upon to balance the interest in
free expression against other interests, it seems to me important that we should
keep in the forefront the question of whether those other interests are state or
federal. Since under our constitutional scheme the two are not necessarily
equivalent, the balancing process must needs often produce different results.
Whether a particular limitation on speech or press is to be upheld because it
subserves a paramount governmental interest must, to a large extent, I think,
depend on whether that government has, under the Constitution, a direct
substantive interest, that is, the power to act, in the particular area involved.”
*** It is no answer to say, as the Court does, that obscenity is not protected
speech. The point is that this statute, as here construed, defines obscenity so
widely that it encompasses matters which might very well be protected speech. I
do not think that the federal statute can be constitutionally construed to reach
other than what the Government has termed as "hard-core" pornography. Nor
do I think the statute can fairly be read as directed only at persons who are
engaged in the business of catering to the prurient minded, even though their
wares fall short of hard-core pornography. Such a statute would raise
constitutional questions of a different order. That being so, and since in my
opinion the material here involved cannot be said to be hard-core pornography,
I would reverse this case with instructions to dismiss the indictment.
JUSTICE DOUGLAS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE BLACK CONCURS, DISSENTING.
When we sustain these convictions, we make the legality of a publication turn
on the purity of thought which a book or tract instills in the mind of the reader.
I do not think we can approve that standard and be faithful to the command of
the First Amendment, which by its terms is a restraint on Congress and which
by the Fourteenth is a restraint on the States.
In the Roth case the trial judge charged the jury that the statutory words
"obscene, lewd and lascivious" describe "that form of immorality which has
relation to sexual impurity and has a tendency to excite lustful thoughts." He
stated that the term "filthy" in the statute pertains "to that sort of treatment of
sexual matters in such a vulgar and indecent way, so that it tends to arouse a
feeling of disgust and revulsion." He went on to say that the material "must be
calculated to corrupt and debauch the minds and morals" of "the average
person in the community," not those of any particular class. "You judge the
circulars, pictures and publications which have been put in evidence by
present-day standards of the community. You may ask yourselves does it offend
the common conscience of the community by present-day standards."
The trial judge who, sitting without a jury, heard the Alberts case and the
appellate court that sustained the judgment of conviction, took California's

Robson

790

The First Amendment

definition of "obscenity" *** that a book is obscene "if it has a substantial
tendency to deprave or corrupt its readers by inciting lascivious thoughts or
arousing lustful desire."
By these standards punishment is inflicted for thoughts provoked, not for overt
acts nor antisocial conduct. This test cannot be squared with our decisions
under the First Amendment. Even the ill-starred Dennis case conceded that
speech to be punishable must have some relation to action which could be
penalized by government. Dennis v. United States (1951). This issue cannot be
avoided by saying that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment. The
question remains, what is the constitutional test of obscenity?
The tests by which these convictions were obtained require only the arousing of
sexual thoughts. Yet the arousing of sexual thoughts and desires happens every
day in normal life in dozens of ways. Nearly 30 years ago a questionnaire sent
to college and normal school women graduates asked what things were most
stimulating sexually. Of 409 replies, 9 said "music"; 18 said "pictures"; 29 said
"dancing"; 40 said "drama"; 95 said "books"; and 218 said "man." Alpert,
Judicial Censorship of Obscene Literature, 52 HARV. L. REV. 40, 73.
The test of obscenity the Court endorses today gives the censor free range over
a vast domain. To allow the State to step in and punish mere speech or
publication that the judge or the jury thinks has an undesirable impact on
thoughts but that is not shown to be a part of unlawful action is drastically to
curtail the First Amendment. ***
The standard of what offends "the common conscience of the community"
conflicts, in my judgment, with the command of the First Amendment that
"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press." Certainly that standard would not be an acceptable one if religion,
economics, politics or philosophy were involved. How does it become a
constitutional standard when literature treating with sex is concerned?
Any test that turns on what is offensive to the community's standards is too
loose, too capricious, too destructive of freedom of expression to be squared
with the First Amendment. Under that test, juries can censor, suppress, and
punish what they don't like, provided the matter relates to "sexual impurity" or
has a tendency "to excite lustful thoughts." This is community censorship in
one of its worst forms. It creates a regime where in the battle between the
literati and the Philistines, the Philistines are certain to win. If experience in
this field teaches anything, it is that "censorship of obscenity has almost always
been both irrational and indiscriminate." The test adopted here accentuates
that trend.
I assume there is nothing in the Constitution which forbids Congress from
using its power over the mails to proscribe conduct on the grounds of good
morals. No one would suggest that the First Amendment permits nudity in
public places, adultery, and other phases of sexual misconduct.
I can understand (and at times even sympathize) with programs of civic groups
and church groups to protect and defend the existing moral standards of the
community. I can understand the motives of the Anthony Comstocks who
would impose Victorian standards on the community. When speech alone is

Robson

791

The First Amendment

involved, I do not think that government, consistently with the First
Amendment, can become the sponsor of any of these movements. I do not think
that government, consistently with the First Amendment, can throw its weight
behind one school or another. Government should be concerned with antisocial
conduct, not with utterances. Thus, if the First Amendment guarantee of
freedom of speech and press is to mean anything in this field, it must allow
protests even against the moral code that the standard of the day sets for the
community. In other words, literature should not be suppressed merely because
it offends the moral code of the censor.
The legality of a publication in this country should never be allowed to turn
either on the purity of thought which it instills in the mind of the reader or on
the degree to which it offends the community conscience. By either test the role
of the censor is exalted, and society's values in literary freedom are sacrificed.
The Court today suggests a third standard. It defines obscene material as that
"which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest." Like the
standards applied by the trial judges below, that standard does not require any
nexus between the literature which is prohibited and action which the
legislature can regulate or prohibit. Under the First Amendment, that standard
is no more valid than those which the courts below adopted.
*** Unlike the law of libel, wrongfully relied on in Beauharnais, there is no
special historical evidence that literature dealing with sex was intended to be
treated in a special manner by those who drafted the First Amendment. In fact,
the first reported court decision in this country involving obscene literature was
in 1821. I reject too the implication that problems of freedom of speech and of
the press are to be resolved by weighing against the values of free expression,
the judgment of the Court that a particular form of that expression has "no
redeeming social importance." The First Amendment, its prohibition in terms
absolute, was designed to preclude courts as well as legislatures from weighing
the values of speech against silence. The First Amendment puts free speech in
the preferred position.
Freedom of expression can be suppressed if, and to the extent that, it is so
closely brigaded with illegal action as to be an inseparable part of it. As a people,
we cannot afford to relax that standard. For the test that suppresses a cheap
tract today can suppress a literary gem tomorrow. All it need do is to incite a
lascivious thought or arouse a lustful desire. The list of books that judges or
juries can place in that category is endless.
I would give the broad sweep of the First Amendment full support. I have the
same confidence in the ability of our people to reject noxious literature as I have
in their capacity to sort out the true from the false in theology, economics,
politics, or any other field.

JUSTICE BRENNAN ANNOUNCED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT AND DELIVERED AN
OPINION IN WHICH JUSTICE GOLDBERG JOINS.
Appellant, Nico Jacobellis, manager of a motion picture theater in Cleveland
Heights, Ohio, was convicted on two counts of possessing and exhibiting an
obscene film in violation of Ohio Revised Code (1963 Supp.) § 2905.34.1 He was
fined $500 on the first count and $2,000 on the second, and was sentenced to
the workhouse if the fines were not paid. His conviction, by a court of three
judges upon waiver of trial by jury, was affirmed by an intermediate appellate
court, and by the Supreme Court of Ohio. We noted probable jurisdiction of the
appeal, and subsequently restored the case to the calendar for reargument. The
dispositive question is whether the state courts properly found that the motion
picture involved, a French film called ‘Les Amants' (‘The Lovers'), was obscene
and hence not entitled to the protection for free expression that is guaranteed
by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. We conclude that the film is not
obscene and that the judgment must accordingly be reversed. ***
JUSTICE STEWART, CONCURRING.
It is possible to read the Court's opinion in Roth v. United States in a variety of
ways. In saying this, I imply no criticism of the Court, which in those cases was
faced with the task of trying to define what may be indefinable. I have reached
the conclusion, which I think is confirmed at least by negative implication in
the Court's decisions since Roth and Alberts that under the First and
Fourteenth Amendments criminal laws in this area are constitutionally limited
to hard-core pornography. I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds
of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and
perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see
it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, WITH WHOM MR. JUSTICE CLARK JOINS, DISSENTING.
In this and other cases in this area of the law, which are coming to us in everincreasing numbers, we are faced with the resolution of rights basic both to
individuals and to society as a whole. Specifically, we are called upon to
reconcile the right of the Nation and of the States to maintain a decent society
and, on the other hand, the right of individuals to express themselves freely in
accordance with the guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Although the Federal Government and virtually every State has had laws
proscribing obscenity since the Union was formed, and although this Court has

Robson

793

The First Amendment

recently decided that obscenity is not within the protection of the First
Amendment, neither courts nor legislatures have been able to evolve a truly
satisfactory definition of obscenity. In other areas of the law, terms like
"negligence," although in common use for centuries, have been difficult to
define except in the most general manner. Yet the courts have been able to
function in such areas with a reasonable degree of efficiency. The obscenity
problem, however, is aggravated by the fact that it involves the area of public
expression, an area in which a broad range of freedom is vital to our society and
is constitutionally protected.
*** For all the sound and fury that the Roth test has generated, it has not been
proved unsound, and I believe that we should try to live with it—at least until a
more satisfactory definition is evolved. No government—be it federal, state, or
local—should be forced to choose between repressing all material, including
that within the realm of decency, and allowing unrestrained license to publish
any material, no matter how vile. There must be a rule of reason in this as in
other areas of the law and we have attempted in the Roth case to provide such a
rule.
*** We are told that only ‘hard core pornography’ should be denied the
protection of the First Amendment. But who can define ‘hard core pornography’
with any greater clarity than ‘obscenity’? And even if we were to retreat to that
position, we would soon be faced with the need to define that term just as we
now are faced with the need to define ‘obscenity.’ Meanwhile, those who profit
from the commercial exploitation of obscenity would continue to ply their trade
unmolested.
*** In light of the foregoing, I would reiterate my acceptance of the rule of the
Roth case: Material is obscene and not constitutionally protected against
regulation and proscription if ‘to the average person, applying contemporary
community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole
appeals to prurient interest.’ I would commit the enforcement of this rule to the
appropriate state and federal courts, and I would accept their judgments made
pursuant to the Roth rule, limiting myself to a consideration only of whether
there is sufficient evidence in the record upon which a finding of obscenity
could be made. If there is no evidence in the record upon which such a finding
could be made, obviously the material involved cannot be held obscene. But
since a mere modicum of evidence may satisfy a ‘no evidence’ standard, I am
unwilling to give the important constitutional right of free expression such
limited protection. However, protection of society's right to maintain its moral
fiber and the effective administration of justice require that this Court not
establish itself as an ultimate censor, in each case reading the entire record,
viewing the accused material, and making an independent de novo judgment on
the question of obscenity. Therefore, once a finding of obscenity has been made
below under a proper application of the Roth test, I would apply a ‘sufficient
evidence’ standard of review—requiring something more than merely any
evidence but something less than ‘substantial evidence on the record (including
the allegedly obscene material) as a whole.’ This is the only reasonable way I
can see to obviate the necessity of this Court's sitting as the Super Censor of all
the obscenity purveyed throughout the Nation.

JUSTICE HARLAN, DISSENTING.
I experience no greater ease than do other members of the Court in attempting
to verbalize generally the respective constitutional tests, for in truth the matter
in the last analysis depends on how particular challenged material happens to
strike the minds of jurors or judges and ultimately those of a majority of the
members of this Court. The application of any general constitutional tests must
thus necessarily be pricked out on a case-by-case basis, but as a point of
departure I would apply to the Federal Government the Roth standards ***. As
to the States, I would make the federal test one of rationality. I would not
prohibit them from banning any material which, taken as a whole, has been
reasonably found in state judicial proceedings to treat with sex in a
fundamentally offensive manner, under rationally established criteria for
judging such material.
On this basis, having viewed the motion picture in question, I think the State
acted within permissible limits in condemning the film and would affirm the
judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court.

BURGER, C.J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT IN WHICH WHITE, BLACKMUN, POWELL,
AND REHNQUIST, J.J. JOINED. DOUGLAS, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION. BRENNAN, J., FILED A
DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH STEWART AND MARSHALL, J.J., JOINED.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
This is one of a group of "obscenity-pornography" cases being reviewed by the
Court in a re-examination of standards enunciated in earlier cases involving
what Mr. Justice Harlan called "the intractable obscenity problem."
Appellant conducted a mass mailing campaign to advertise the sale of
illustrated books, euphemistically called "adult" material. After a jury trial, he
was convicted of violating California Penal Code § 311.2 (a), a misdemeanor, by
knowingly distributing obscene matter, and the Appellate Department, Superior
Court of California, County of Orange, summarily affirmed the judgment
without opinion. Appellant's conviction was specifically based on his conduct in
causing five unsolicited advertising brochures to be sent through the mail in an
envelope addressed to a restaurant in Newport Beach, California. The envelope
was opened by the manager of the restaurant and his mother. They had not
requested the brochures; they complained to the police.
The brochures advertise four books entitled "Intercourse," "Man-Woman," "Sex
Orgies Illustrated," and "An Illustrated History of Pornography," and a film
entitled "Marital Intercourse." While the brochures contain some descriptive
printed material, primarily they consist of pictures and drawings very explicitly
depicting men and women in groups of two or more engaging in a variety of
sexual activities, with genitals often prominently displayed.

The First Amendment

This case involves the application of a State's criminal obscenity statute to a
situation in which sexually explicit materials have been thrust by aggressive
sales action upon unwilling recipients who had in no way indicated any desire
to receive such materials. This Court has recognized that the States have a
legitimate interest in prohibiting dissemination or exhibition of obscene material
when the mode of dissemination carries with it a significant danger of offending
the sensibilities of unwilling recipients or of exposure to juveniles. It is in this
context that we are called on to define the standards which must be used to
identify obscene material that a State may regulate without infringing on the
First Amendment as applicable to the States through the Fourteenth
Amendment.
The dissent of Justice Brennan reviews the background of the obscenity
problem, but since the Court now undertakes to formulate standards more
concrete than those in the past, it is useful for us to focus on two of the
landmark cases in the somewhat tortured history of the Court's obscenity
decisions. In Roth v. United States (1957), the Court sustained a conviction
under a federal statute punishing the mailing of "obscene, lewd, lascivious or
filthy . . ." materials. The key to that holding was the Court's rejection of the
claim that obscene materials were protected by the First Amendment. ***
Nine years later, in Memoirs v. Massachusetts (1966), the Court veered sharply
away from the Roth concept and, with only three Justices in the plurality
opinion, articulated a new test of obscenity. The plurality held that under the
Roth definition
"as elaborated in subsequent cases, three elements must coalesce: it must be
established that (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole
appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive
because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the
description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly
without redeeming social value."

The sharpness of the break with Roth, represented by the third element of the
Memoirs test and emphasized by Justice White's dissent, was further
underscored when the Memoirs plurality went on to state:
"The Supreme Judicial Court erred in holding that a book need not be
`unqualifiedly worthless before it can be deemed obscene.' A book cannot be
proscribed unless it is found to be utterly without redeeming social value."
(emphasis in original).

While Roth presumed "obscenity" to be "utterly without redeeming social
importance," Memoirs required that to prove obscenity it must be affirmatively
established that the material is "utterly without redeeming social value." Thus,
even as they repeated the words of Roth, the Memoirs plurality produced a
drastically altered test that called on the prosecution to prove a negative, i. e.,
that the material was "utterly without redeeming social value"—a burden
virtually impossible to discharge under our criminal standards of proof. Such
considerations caused Justice Harlan [dissenting] to wonder if the "utterly
without redeeming social value" test had any meaning at all.
Apart from the initial formulation in the Roth case, no majority of the Court has
at any given time been able to agree on a standard to determine what
Robson

796

The First Amendment

constitutes obscene, pornographic material subject to regulation under the
States' police power. This is not remarkable, for in the area of freedom of
speech and press the courts must always remain sensitive to any infringement
on genuinely serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific expression. This is
an area in which there are few eternal verities.
The case we now review was tried on the theory that the California Penal Code
§311 approximately incorporates the three-stage Memoirs test. But now the
Memoirs test has been abandoned as unworkable by its author, and no Member
of the Court today supports the Memoirs formulation.
II
This much has been categorically settled by the Court, that obscene material is
unprotected by the First Amendment. We acknowledge, however, the inherent
dangers of undertaking to regulate any form of expression. State statutes
designed to regulate obscene materials must be carefully limited. As a result,
we now confine the permissible scope of such regulation to works which depict
or describe sexual conduct. That conduct must be specifically defined by the
applicable state law, as written or authoritatively construed. A state offense
must also be limited to works which, taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient
interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and
which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or
scientific value.
The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether "the average
person, applying contemporary community standards" would find that the
work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work
depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically
defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole,
lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. We do not adopt as a
constitutional standard the "utterly without redeeming social value" test of
Memoirs v. Massachusetts; that concept has never commanded the adherence of
more than three Justices at one time. If a state law that regulates obscene
material is thus limited, as written or construed, the First Amendment values
applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment are adequately
protected by the ultimate power of appellate courts to conduct an independent
review of constitutional claims when necessary.
We emphasize that it is not our function to propose regulatory schemes for the
States. That must await their concrete legislative efforts. It is possible, however,
to give a few plain examples of what a state statute could define for regulation
under part (b) of the standard announced in this opinion:
(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts,
normal or perverted, actual or simulated.
(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory
functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.
Sex and nudity may not be exploited without limit by films or pictures exhibited
or sold in places of public accommodation any more than live sex and nudity
can be exhibited or sold without limit in such public places. At a minimum,
prurient, patently offensive depiction or description of sexual conduct must

Robson

797

The First Amendment

have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value to merit First
Amendment protection. For example, medical books for the education of
physicians and related personnel necessarily use graphic illustrations and
descriptions of human anatomy. In resolving the inevitably sensitive questions
of fact and law, we must continue to rely on the jury system, accompanied by
the safeguards that judges, rules of evidence, presumption of innocence, and
other protective features provide, as we do with rape, murder, and a host of
other offenses against society and its individual members.
Justice Brennan, author of the opinions of the Court, or the plurality opinions,
in Roth v. United States; Jacobellis v. Ohio; Ginzburg v. United States (1966),
Mishkin v. New York (1966); and Memoirs v. Massachusetts has abandoned his
former position and now maintains that no formulation of this Court, the
Congress, or the States can adequately distinguish obscene material
unprotected by the First Amendment from protected expression, Paradoxically,
Justice Brennan indicates that suppression of unprotected obscene material is
permissible to avoid exposure to unconsenting adults, as in this case, and to
juveniles, although he gives no indication of how the division between protected
and nonprotected materials may be drawn with greater precision for these
purposes than for regulation of commercial exposure to consenting adults only.
Nor does he indicate where in the Constitution he finds the authority to
distinguish between a willing "adult" one month past the state law age of
majority and a willing "juvenile" one month younger.
Under the holdings announced today, no one will be subject to prosecution for
the sale or exposure of obscene materials unless these materials depict or
describe patently offensive "hard core" sexual conduct specifically defined by
the regulating state law, as written or construed. We are satisfied that these
specific prerequisites will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials that
his public and commercial activities may bring prosecution. If the inability to
define regulated materials with ultimate, god-like precision altogether removes
the power of the States or the Congress to regulate, then "hard core"
pornography may be exposed without limit to the juvenile, the passerby, and
the consenting adult alike, as, indeed, Justice Douglas contends. In this belief,
however, Justice Douglas now stands alone.
*** It is certainly true that the absence, since Roth, of a single majority view of
this Court as to proper standards for testing obscenity has placed a strain on
both state and federal courts. But today, for the first time since Roth was
decided in 1957, a majority of this Court has agreed on concrete guidelines to
isolate "hard core" pornography from expression protected by the First
Amendment. ***
This may not be an easy road, free from difficulty. But no amount of "fatigue"
should lead us to adopt a convenient "institutional" rationale—an absolutist,
"anything goes" view of the First Amendment—because it will lighten our
burdens. " *** Nor should we remedy "tension between state and federal courts"
by arbitrarily depriving the States of a power reserved to them under the
Constitution, a power which they have enjoyed and exercised continuously from
before the adoption of the First Amendment to this day. ***

The First Amendment

Under a National Constitution, fundamental First Amendment limitations on
the powers of the States do not vary from community to community, but this
does not mean that there are, or should or can be, fixed, uniform national
standards of precisely what appeals to the "prurient interest" or is "patently
offensive." These are essentially questions of fact, and our Nation is simply too
big and too diverse for this Court to reasonably expect that such standards
could be articulated for all 50 States in a single formulation, even assuming the
prerequisite consensus exists. When triers of fact are asked to decide whether
"the average person, applying contemporary community standards" would
consider certain materials "prurient," it would be unrealistic to require that the
answer be based on some abstract formulation. The adversary system, with lay
jurors as the usual ultimate factfinders in criminal prosecutions, has
historically permitted triers of fact to draw on the standards of their
community, guided always by limiting instructions on the law. To require a
State to structure obscenity proceedings around evidence of a national
"community standard" would be an exercise in futility.
As noted before, this case was tried on the theory that the California obscenity
statute sought to incorporate the tripartite test of Memoirs. This, a "national"
standard of First Amendment protection enumerated by a plurality of this
Court, was correctly regarded at the time of trial as limiting state prosecution
under the controlling case law. The jury, however, was explicitly instructed
that, in determining whether the "dominant theme of the material as a whole . .
. appeals to the prurient interest" and in determining whether the material
"goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor and affronts
contemporary community standards of decency," it was to apply "contemporary
community standards of the State of California."
During the trial, both the prosecution and the defense assumed that the
relevant "community standards" in making the factual determination of
obscenity were those of the State of California, not some hypothetical standard
of the entire United States of America. Defense counsel at trial never objected to
the testimony of the State's expert on community standards or to the
instructions of the trial judge on "statewide" standards. On appeal to the
Appellate Department, Superior Court of California, County of Orange,
appellant for the first time contended that application of state, rather than
national, standards violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
We conclude that neither the State's alleged failure to offer evidence of "national
standards," nor the trial court's charge that the jury consider state community
standards, were constitutional errors. Nothing in the First Amendment requires
that a jury must consider hypothetical and unascertainable "national
standards" when attempting to determine whether certain materials are
obscene as a matter of fact. ***
It is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read the First Amendment as
requiring that the people of Maine or Mississippi accept public depiction of
conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas, or New York City. People in different
States vary in their tastes and attitudes, and this diversity is not to be strangled
by the absolutism of imposed uniformity. As the Court made clear in Mishkin v.
New York (1966) the primary concern with requiring a jury to apply the
standard of "the average person, applying contemporary community standards"

Robson

799

The First Amendment

is to be certain that, so far as material is not aimed at a deviant group, it will be
judged by its impact on an average person, rather than a particularly
susceptible or sensitive person—or indeed a totally insensitive one. See Roth v.
United States Cf. the now discredited test in Regina v.Hicklin [1868]. We hold
that the requirement that the jury evaluate the materials with reference to
"contemporary standards of the State of California" serves this protective
purpose and is constitutionally adequate.
IV
The dissenting Justices sound the alarm of repression. But, in our view, to
equate the free and robust exchange of ideas and political debate with
commercial exploitation of obscene material demeans the grand conception of
the First Amendment and its high purposes in the historic struggle for freedom.
*** The First Amendment protects works which, taken as a whole, have serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, regardless of whether the
government or a majority of the people approve of the ideas these works
represent. "The protection given speech and press was fashioned to assure
unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social
changes desired by the people," Roth v. United States. But the public portrayal
of hard-core sexual conduct for its own sake, and for the ensuing commercial
gain, is a different matter.
There is no evidence, empirical or historical, that the stern 19th century
American censorship of public distribution and display of material relating to
sex in any way limited or affected expression of serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific ideas. On the contrary, it is beyond any question that the
era following Thomas Jefferson to Theodore Roosevelt was an "extraordinarily
vigorous period," not just in economics and politics, but in belles lettres and in
"the outlying fields of social and political philosophies." We do not see the harsh
hand of censorship of ideas—good or bad, sound or unsound— and "repression"
of political liberty lurking in every state regulation of commercial exploitation of
human interest in sex.
*** One can concede that the "sexual revolution" of recent years may have had
useful byproducts in striking layers of prudery from a subject long irrationally
kept from needed ventilation. But it does not follow that no regulation of
patently offensive "hard core" materials is needed or permissible; civilized
people do not allow unregulated access to heroin because it is a derivative of
medicinal morphine.
In sum, we (a) reaffirm the Roth holding that obscene material is not protected
by the First Amendment; (b) hold that such material can be regulated by the
States, subject to the specific safeguards enunciated above, without a showing
that the material is "utterly without redeeming social value"; and (c) hold that
obscenity is to be determined by applying "contemporary community
standards," not "national standards." The judgment of the Appellate
Department of the Superior Court, Orange County, California, is vacated and
the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with
the First Amendment standards established by this opinion.
Vacated and remanded.

The First Amendment

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, DISSENTING.
I
***Today the Court retreats from the earlier formulations of the constitutional
test and undertakes to make new definitions. This effort, like the earlier ones, is
earnest and well intentioned. The difficulty is that we do not deal with
constitutional terms, since "obscenity" is not mentioned in the Constitution or
Bill of Rights. And the First Amendment makes no such exception from "the
press" which it undertakes to protect nor, as I have said on other occasions, is
an exception necessarily implied, for there was no recognized exception to the
free press at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted which treated "obscene"
publications differently from other types of papers, magazines, and books. So
there are no constitutional guidelines for deciding what is and what is not
"obscene." The Court is at large because we deal with tastes and standards of
literature. What shocks me may be sustenance for my neighbor. What causes
one person to boil up in rage over one pamphlet or movie may reflect only his
neurosis, not shared by others. We deal here with a regime of censorship which,
if adopted, should be done by constitutional amendment after full debate by the
people.
Obscenity cases usually generate tremendous emotional outbursts. They have
no business being in the courts. If a constitutional amendment authorized
censorship, the censor would probably be an administrative agency. Then
criminal prosecutions could follow as, if, and when publishers defied the censor
and sold their literature. Under that regime a publisher would know when he
was on dangerous ground. Under the present regime— whether the old
standards or the new ones are used—the criminal law becomes a trap. A brand
new test would put a publisher behind bars under a new law improvised by the
courts after the publication. ***
II
[omitted]
III
While the right to know is the corollary of the right to speak or publish, no one
can be forced by government to listen to disclosure that he finds offensive. ***
There is no "captive audience" problem in these obscenity cases. No one is being
compelled to look or to listen. Those who enter newsstands or bookstalls may
be offended by what they see. But they are not compelled by the State to
frequent those places; and it is only state or governmental action against which
the First Amendment, applicable to the States by virtue of the Fourteenth,
raises a ban.
The idea that the First Amendment permits government to ban publications
that are "offensive" to some people puts an ominous gloss on freedom of the
press. That test would make it possible to ban any paper or any journal or
magazine in some benighted place. The First Amendment was designed "to
invite dispute," to induce "a condition of unrest," to "create dissatisfaction with
conditions as they are," and even to stir "people to anger." Terminiello v. Chicago
(1949). The idea that the First Amendment permits punishment for ideas that
are "offensive" to the particular judge or jury sitting in judgment is astounding.
No greater leveler of speech or literature has ever been designed. To give the
power to the censor, as we do today, is to make a sharp and radical break with

Robson

801

The First Amendment

the traditions of a free society. The First Amendment was not fashioned as a
vehicle for dispensing tranquilizers to the people. Its prime function was to keep
debate open to "offensive" as well as to "staid" people. The tendency throughout
history has been to subdue the individual and to exalt the power of government.
The use of the standard "offensive" gives authority to government that cuts the
very vitals out of the First Amendment. As is intimated by the Court's opinion,
the materials before us may be garbage. But so is much of what is said in
political campaigns, in the daily press, on TV, or over the radio. By reason of
the First Amendment—and solely because of it— speakers and publishers have
not been threatened or subdued because their thoughts and ideas may be
"offensive" to some.
*** We deal with highly emotional, not rational, questions. To many the Song of
Solomon is obscene. I do not think we, the judges, were ever given the
constitutional power to make definitions of obscenity. If it is to be defined, let
the people debate and decide by a constitutional amendment what they want to
ban as obscene and what standards they want the legislatures and the courts
to apply. Perhaps the people will decide that the path towards a mature,
integrated society requires that all ideas competing for acceptance must have
no censor. Perhaps they will decide otherwise. Whatever the choice, the courts
will have some guidelines. Now we have none except our own predilections.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEWART AND JUSTICE MARSHALL JOIN,
DISSENTING. [OMITTED]

Note:	  Prurient	  Interest	  
In Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502 (1966), the Court clarified that the
“prurient” interest requirement articulated in Roth (and adopted in Miller)
need not be applicable to the average person. The materials in Mishkin
were fifty “cheaply prepared paperbound ‘pulps’” that portrayed
“sexuality in many guises” including “relatively normal heterosexual
relations” as well as “such deviations as sado-masochism, fetishism, and
homosexuality” with covers featuring “drawings of scantily clad women
being whipped, beaten, tortured, or abused.”
Justice Brennan’s opinion for the Court stated:
Where the material is designed for and primarily disseminated to a clearly
defined deviant sexual group, rather than the public at large, the prurientappeal requirement of the Roth test is satisfied if the dominant theme of the
material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest in sex of the members
of that group. The reference to the "average" or "normal" person in Roth does not
foreclose this holding. In regard to the prurient-appeal requirement, the concept
of the "average" or "normal" person was employed in Roth to serve the essentially
negative purpose of expressing our rejection of that aspect of the Hicklin test,
Regina v. Hicklin (1868) that made the impact on the most susceptible person
determinative. We adjust the prurient-appeal requirement to social realities by
permitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in terms of the

Robson

802

The First Amendment

sexual interests of its intended and probable recipient group; and since our
holding requires that the recipient group be defined with more specificity than in
terms of sexually immature persons, it also avoids the inadequacy of the mostsusceptible-person facet of the Hicklin test.
No substantial claim is made that the books depicting sexually deviant practices
are devoid of prurient appeal to sexually deviant groups. The evidence fully
establishes that these books were specifically conceived and marketed for such
groups. Appellant instructed his authors and artists to prepare the books
expressly to induce their purchase by persons who would probably be sexually
stimulated by them. It was for this reason that appellant "wanted an emphasis
on beatings and fetishism and clothing - irregular clothing, and that sort of
thing, and again sex scenes between women; always sex scenes had to be very
strong." And to be certain that authors fulfilled his purpose, appellant furnished
them with such source materials as CAPRIO, VARIATIONS IN SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, and
KRAFFT-EBING, PSYCHOPATHIA SEXUALIS.

MARSHALL, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT IN WHICH WARREN, C.J., AND DOUGLAS,
HARLAN, AND FORTAS, JOINED. STEWART, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION IN WHICH BRENNAN
AND WHITE, J.J., JOINED. BLACK, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION.

JUSTICE MARSHALL DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
An investigation of appellant's alleged bookmaking activities led to the issuance
of a search warrant for appellant's home. Under authority of this warrant,
federal and state agents secured entrance. They found very little evidence of
bookmaking activity, but while looking through a desk drawer in an upstairs
bedroom, one of the federal agents, accompanied by a state officer, found three
reels of eight-millimeter film. Using a projector and screen found in an upstairs
living room, they viewed the films. The state officer concluded that they were
obscene and seized them. Since a further examination of the bedroom indicated
that appellant occupied it, he was charged with possession of obscene matter
and placed under arrest. He was later indicted for "knowingly hav[ing]
possession of . . . obscene matter" in violation of Georgia law. Appellant was

Robson

803

The First Amendment

tried before a jury and convicted. The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed. We
noted probable jurisdiction of an appeal brought under 28 U. S. C. § 1257.
Appellant raises several challenges to the validity of his conviction. We find it
necessary to consider only one. Appellant argues here, and argued below, that
the Georgia obscenity statute, insofar as it punishes mere private possession of
obscene matter, violates the First Amendment, as made applicable to the States
by the Fourteenth Amendment. For reasons set forth below, we agree that the
mere private possession of obscene matter cannot constitutionally be made a
crime.
*** It is true that Roth does declare, seemingly without qualification, that
obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment. That statement has been
repeated in various forms in subsequent cases. However, neither Roth nor any
subsequent decision of this Court dealt with the precise problem involved in the
present case. Roth was convicted of mailing obscene circulars and advertising,
and an obscene book, in violation of a federal obscenity statute. The defendant
in a companion case, Alberts v. California (1957) was convicted of "lewdly
keeping for sale obscene and indecent books, and [of] writing, composing and
publishing an obscene advertisement of them . . . ." None of the statements
cited by the Court in Roth for the proposition that "this Court has always
assumed that obscenity is not protected by the freedoms of speech and press"
were made in the context of a statute punishing mere private possession of
obscene material; the cases cited deal for the most part with use of the mails to
distribute objectionable material or with some form of public distribution or
dissemination. Moreover, none of this Court's decisions subsequent to Roth
involved prosecution for private possession of obscene materials. Those cases
dealt with the power of the State and Federal Governments to prohibit or
regulate certain public actions taken or intended to be taken with respect to
obscene matter. Indeed, with one exception, we have been unable to discover
any case in which the issue in the present case has been fully considered.
In this context, we do not believe that this case can be decided simply by citing
Roth. Roth and its progeny certainly do mean that the First and Fourteenth
Amendments recognize a valid governmental interest in dealing with the
problem of obscenity. But the assertion of that interest cannot, in every context,
be insulated from all constitutional protections. Neither Roth nor any other
decision of this Court reaches that far. *** Roth and the cases following it
discerned such an "important interest" in the regulation of commercial
distribution of obscene material. That holding cannot foreclose an examination
of the constitutional implications of a statute forbidding mere private
possession of such material.
It is now well established that the Constitution protects the right to receive
information and ideas. "This freedom [of speech and press] . . . necessarily
protects the right to receive . . . ." Martin v. City of Struthers (1943); see Griswold
v. Connecticut (1965); Lamont v. Postmaster General (1965) (Brennan, J.,
concurring); cf. Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925). This right to receive
information and ideas, regardless of their social worth, see Winters v. New York,
(1948), is fundamental to our free society. Moreover, in the context of this
case—a prosecution for mere possession of printed or filmed matter in the
privacy of a person's own home—that right takes on an added dimension. For

Robson

804

The First Amendment

also fundamental is the right to be free, except in very limited circumstances,
from unwanted governmental intrusions into one's privacy.
"The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the
pursuit of happiness. They recognized the significance of man's spiritual nature,
of his feelings and of his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain,
pleasure and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things. They sought
to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their
sensations. They conferred, as against the Government, the right to be let
alone—the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized
man."

Olmstead v. United States (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).
These are the rights that appellant is asserting in the case before us. He is
asserting the right to read or observe what he pleases—the right to satisfy his
intellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his own home. He is asserting
the right to be free from state inquiry into the contents of his library. Georgia
contends that appellant does not have these rights, that there are certain types
of materials that the individual may not read or even possess. Georgia justifies
this assertion by arguing that the films in the present case are obscene. But we
think that mere categorization of these films as "obscene" is insufficient
justification for such a drastic invasion of personal liberties guaranteed by the
First and Fourteenth Amendments. Whatever may be the justifications for other
statutes regulating obscenity, we do not think they reach into the privacy of
one's own home. If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State
has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he
may read or what films he may watch. Our whole constitutional heritage rebels
at the thought of giving government the power to control men's minds.
And yet, in the face of these traditional notions of individual liberty, Georgia
asserts the right to protect the individual's mind from the effects of obscenity.
We are not certain that this argument amounts to anything more than the
assertion that the State has the right to control the moral content of a person's
thoughts. To some, this may be a noble purpose, but it is wholly inconsistent
with the philosophy of the First Amendment. *** Nor is it relevant that obscene
materials in general, or the particular films before the Court, are arguably
devoid of any ideological content. The line between the transmission of ideas
and mere entertainment is much too elusive for this Court to draw, if indeed
such a line can be drawn at all. See Winters v. New York. Whatever the power of
the state to control public dissemination of ideas inimical to the public morality,
it cannot constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling a
person's private thoughts.
Perhaps recognizing this, Georgia asserts that exposure to obscene materials
may lead to deviant sexual behavior or crimes of sexual violence. There appears
to be little empirical basis for that assertion. But more important, if the State is
only concerned about printed or filmed materials inducing antisocial conduct,
we believe that in the context of private consumption of ideas and information
we should adhere to the view that "[a]mong free men, the deterrents ordinarily
to be applied to prevent crime are education and punishment for violations of
the law . . . ." Whitney v. California (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Given the
present state of knowledge, the State may no more prohibit mere possession of

Robson

805

The First Amendment

obscene matter on the ground that it may lead to antisocial conduct than it
may prohibit possession of chemistry books on the ground that they may lead
to the manufacture of homemade spirits.
It is true that in Roth this Court rejected the necessity of proving that exposure
to obscene material would create a clear and present danger of antisocial
conduct or would probably induce its recipients to such conduct. But that case
dealt with public distribution of obscene materials and such distribution is
subject to different objections. For example, there is always the danger that
obscene material might fall into the hands of children, see Ginsberg v. New York,
or that it might intrude upon the sensibilities or privacy of the general public.
See Redrup v. New York (1967). No such dangers are present in this case.
Finally, we are faced with the argument that prohibition of possession of
obscene materials is a necessary incident to statutory schemes prohibiting
distribution. That argument is based on alleged difficulties of proving an intent
to distribute or in producing evidence of actual distribution. We are not
convinced that such difficulties exist, but even if they did we do not think that
they would justify infringement of the individual's right to read or observe what
he pleases. Because that right is so fundamental to our scheme of individual
liberty, its restriction may not be justified by the need to ease the
administration of otherwise valid criminal laws. See Smith v. California (1959).
We hold that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit making mere
private possession of obscene material a crime. Roth and the cases following
that decision are not impaired by today's holding. As we have said, the States
retain broad power to regulate obscenity; that power simply does not extend to
mere possession by the individual in the privacy of his own home. Accordingly,
the judgment of the court below is reversed and the case is remanded for
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

CONCURRING IN THE RESULT.
Before the commencement of the trial in this case, the appellant filed a motion
to suppress the films as evidence upon the ground that they had been seized in
violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The motion was denied,
and the films were admitted in evidence at the trial. In affirming the appellant's
conviction, the Georgia Supreme Court specifically determined that the films
had been lawfully seized. The appellant correctly contends that this
determination was clearly wrong under established principles of constitutional
law. But the Court today disregards this preliminary issue in its hurry to move
on to newer constitutional frontiers. I cannot so readily overlook the serious
inroads upon Fourth Amendment guarantees countenanced in this case by the
Georgia courts.

413 U.S. 49 (1973)

BURGER, C.J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH WHITE, BLACKMUN, POWELL,
AND REHNQUIST, JJ., JOINED. DOUGLAS, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION. BRENNAN, J., FILED A
DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH STEWART AND MARSHALL, JJ., JOINED.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Petitioners are two Atlanta, Georgia, movie theaters and their owners and
managers, operating in the style of "adult" theaters. On December 28, 1970,
respondents, the local state district attorney and the solicitor for the local state
trial court, filed civil complaints in that court alleging that petitioners were
exhibiting to the public for paid admission two allegedly obscene films, contrary
to Georgia Code Ann. § 26-2101. The two films in question, "Magic Mirror" and
"It All Comes Out in the End," depict sexual conduct characterized by the
Georgia Supreme Court as "hard core pornography" leaving "little to the
imagination."
Respondents' complaints, made on behalf of the State of Georgia, demanded
that the two films be declared obscene and that petitioners be enjoined from
exhibiting the films. The exhibition of the films was not enjoined, but a
temporary injunction was granted ex parte by the local trial court, restraining
petitioners from destroying the films or removing them from the jurisdiction.
Petitioners were further ordered to have one print each of the films in court on
January 13, 1971, together with the proper viewing equipment.
On January 13, 1971, 15 days after the proceedings began, the films were
produced by petitioners at a jury-waived trial. Certain photographs, also
produced at trial, were stipulated to portray the single entrance to both Paris
Adult Theatre I and Paris Adult Theatre II as it appeared at the time of the
complaints. These photographs show a conventional, inoffensive theater
entrance, without any pictures, but with signs indicating that the theaters
exhibit "Atlanta's Finest Mature Feature Films." On the door itself is a sign
saying: "Adult Theatre—You must be 21 and able to prove it. If viewing the
nude body offends you, Please Do Not Enter."
The two films were exhibited to the trial court. The only other state evidence
was testimony by criminal investigators that they had paid admission to see the
films and that nothing on the outside of the theater indicated the full nature of
what was shown. In particular, nothing indicated that the films depicted—as
they did— scenes of simulated fellatio, cunnilingus, and group sex intercourse.
There was no evidence presented that minors had ever entered the theaters. Nor
was there evidence presented that petitioners had a systematic policy of barring
minors, apart from posting signs at the entrance. On April 12, 1971, the trial

Robson

807

The First Amendment

judge dismissed respondents' complaints. He assumed "that obscenity is
established," but stated:
"It appears to the Court that the display of these films in a commercial theatre,
when surrounded by requisite notice to the public of their nature and by
reasonable protection against the exposure of these films to minors, is
constitutionally permissible."

On appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court unanimously reversed. It assumed that
the adult theaters in question barred minors and gave a full warning to the
general public of the nature of the films shown, but held that the films were
without protection under the First Amendment. Citing the opinion of this Court
in United States v. Reidel (1971), the Georgia court stated that "the sale and
delivery of obscene material to willing adults is not protected under the first
amendment." The Georgia court also held Stanley v. Georgia (1969), to be
inapposite since it did not deal with "the commercial distribution of
pornography, but with the right of Stanley to possess, in the privacy of his
home, pornographic films." After viewing the films, the Georgia Supreme Court
held that their exhibition should have been enjoined, stating:
"The films in this case leave little to the imagination. It is plain what they
purport to depict, that is, conduct of the most salacious character. We hold that
these films are also hard core pornography, and the showing of such films
should have been enjoined since their exhibition is not protected by the first
amendment."

I
It should be clear from the outset that we do not undertake to tell the States
what they must do, but rather to define the area in which they may chart their
own course in dealing with obscene material. This Court has consistently held
that obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment as a limitation
on the state police power by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. ***
In the cases in which this Court has decided obscenity questions since Roth, it
has regarded the materials as sufficient in themselves for the determination of
the question."
II
We categorically disapprove the theory, apparently adopted by the trial judge,
that obscene, pornographic films acquire constitutional immunity from state
regulation simply because they are exhibited for consenting adults only. This
holding was properly rejected by the Georgia Supreme Court. Although we have
often pointedly recognized the high importance of the state interest in
regulating the exposure of obscene materials to juveniles and unconsenting
adults, see Miller v. California; Stanley v. Georgia; Redrup v. New York (1967),
this Court has never declared these to be the only legitimate state interests
permitting regulation of obscene material. The States have a long recognized
legitimate interest in regulating the use of obscene material in local commerce
and in all places of public accommodation, as long as these regulations do not
run afoul of specific constitutional prohibitions. ***
In particular, we hold that there are legitimate state interests at stake in
stemming the tide of commercialized obscenity, even assuming it is feasible to

Robson

808

The First Amendment

enforce effective safeguards against exposure to juveniles and to passerby.
Rights and interests "other than those of the advocates are involved." These
include the interest of the public in the quality of life and the total community
environment, the tone of commerce in the great city centers, and, possibly, the
public safety itself. The Hill-Link Minority Report of the Commission on
Obscenity and Pornography indicates that there is at least an arguable
correlation between obscene material and crime. Quite apart from sex crimes,
however, there remains one problem of large proportions aptly described by
Professor Bickel:
"It concerns the tone of the society, the mode, or to use terms that have perhaps
greater currency, the style and quality of life, now and in the future. A man may
be entitled to read an obscene book in his room, or expose himself indecently
there . . . . We should protect his privacy. But if he demands a right to obtain
the books and pictures he wants in the market, and to foregather in public
places—discreet, if you will, but accessible to all—with others who share his
tastes, then to grant him his right is to affect the world about the rest of us, and to
impinge on other privacies. Even supposing that each of us can, if he wishes,
effectively avert the eye and stop the ear (which, in truth, we cannot), what is
commonly read and seen and heard and done intrudes upon us all, want it or
not."

22 THE PUBLIC INTEREST 25-26 (Winter 1971).(Emphasis added.)
As Mr. Chief Justice Warren stated, there is a "right of the Nation and of the
States to maintain a decent society, Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964) (dissenting
opinion).
But, it is argued, there are no scientific data which conclusively demonstrate
that exposure to obscene material adversely affects men and women or their
society. It is urged on behalf of the petitioners that, absent such a
demonstration, any kind of state regulation is "impermissible." We reject this
argument. It is not for us to resolve empirical uncertainties underlying state
legislation, save in the exceptional case where that legislation plainly impinges
upon rights protected by the Constitution itself. ***
From the beginning of civilized societies, legislators and judges have acted on
various unprovable assumptions. Such assumptions underlie much lawful state
regulation of commercial and business affairs. The same is true of the federal
securities and antitrust laws and a host of federal regulations. On the basis of
these assumptions both Congress and state legislatures have, for example,
drastically restricted associational rights by adopting antitrust laws, and have
strictly regulated public expression by issuers of and dealers in securities, profit
sharing "coupons," and "trading stamps," commanding what they must and
must not publish and announce. Understandably those who entertain an
absolutist view of the First Amendment find it uncomfortable to explain why
rights of association, speech, and press should be severely restrained in the
marketplace of goods and money, but not in the marketplace of pornography.
Likewise, when legislatures and administrators act to protect the physical
environment from pollution and to preserve our resources of forests, streams,
and parks, they must act on such imponderables as the impact of a new
highway near or through an existing park or wilderness area. *** The fact that a
congressional directive reflects unprovable assumptions about what is good for
Robson

809

The First Amendment

the people, including imponderable aesthetic assumptions, is not a sufficient
reason to find that statute unconstitutional.
*** The sum of experience, including that of the past two decades, affords an
ample basis for legislatures to conclude that a sensitive, key relationship of
human existence, central to family life, community welfare, and the
development of human personality, can be debased and distorted by crass
commercial exploitation of sex. Nothing in the Constitution prohibits a State
from reaching such a conclusion and acting on it legislatively simply because
there is no conclusive evidence or empirical data.
It is asserted, however, that standards for evaluating state commercial
regulations are inapposite in the present context, as state regulation of access
by consenting adults to obscene material violates the constitutionally protected
right to privacy enjoyed by petitioners' customers. Even assuming that
petitioners have vicarious standing to assert potential customers' rights, it is
unavailing to compare a theater open to the public for a fee, with the private
home of Stanley v. Georgia and the marital bedroom of Griswold v. Connecticut.
This Court, has, on numerous occasions, refused to hold that commercial
ventures such as a motion-picture house are "private" for the purpose of civil
rights litigation and civil rights statutes. See Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United
States (1964). The Civil Rights Act of 1964 specifically defines motion-picture
houses and theaters as places of "public accommodation" covered by the Act as
operations affecting commerce. 78 Stat. 243, 42 U. S. C. §§ 2000a (b) (3), (c).
Our prior decisions recognizing a right to privacy guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment included "only personal rights that can be deemed `fundamental' or
`implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.' Palko v. Connecticut (1937)." Roe v.
Wade (1973). This privacy right encompasses and protects the personal
intimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation, and
child rearing. Cf. Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972); Stanley v. Georgia; Loving v.
Virginia (1967); Griswold v. Connecticut; Prince v. Massachusetts (1944); Skinner
v. Oklahoma (1942); Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925); Meyer v. Nebraska (1923).
Nothing, however, in this Court's decisions intimates that there is any
"fundamental" privacy right "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty" to watch
obscene movies in places of public accommodation.
If obscene material unprotected by the First Amendment in itself carried with it
a "penumbra" of constitutionally protected privacy, this Court would not have
found it necessary to decide Stanley on the narrow basis of the "privacy of the
home," which was hardly more than a reaffirmation that "a man's home is his
castle." Cf. Stanley v.Georgia. Moreover, we have declined to equate the privacy
of the home relied on in Stanley with a "zone" of "privacy" that follows a
distributor or a consumer of obscene materials wherever he goes. The idea of a
"privacy" right and a place of public accommodation are, in this context,
mutually exclusive. Conduct or depictions of conduct that the state police
power can prohibit on a public street do not become automatically protected by
the Constitution merely because the conduct is moved to a bar or a "live"
theater stage, any more than a "live" performance of a man and woman locked
in a sexual embrace at high noon in Times Square is protected by the
Constitution because they simultaneously engage in a valid political dialogue.

Robson

810

The First Amendment

It is also argued that the State has no legitimate interest in "control [of] the
moral content of a person's thoughts," Stanley v. Georgia, and we need not
quarrel with this. But we reject the claim that the State of Georgia is here
attempting to control the minds or thoughts of those who patronize theaters.
Preventing unlimited display or distribution of obscene material, which by
definition lacks any serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as
communication, Miller v. California, is distinct from a control of reason and the
intellect. Where communication of ideas, protected by the First Amendment, is
not involved, or the particular privacy of the home protected by Stanley, or any
of the other "areas or zones" of constitutionally protected privacy, the mere fact
that, as a consequence, some human "utterances" or "thoughts" may be
incidentally affected does not bar the State from acting to protect legitimate
state interests. The fantasies of a drug addict are his own and beyond the reach
of government, but government regulation of drug sales is not prohibited by the
Constitution.
Finally, petitioners argue that conduct which directly involves "consenting
adults" only has, for that sole reason, a special claim to constitutional
protection. Our Constitution establishes a broad range of conditions on the
exercise of power by the States, but for us to say that our Constitution
incorporates the proposition that conduct involving consenting adults only is
always beyond state regulation is a step we are unable to take. Commercial
exploitation of depictions, descriptions, or exhibitions of obscene conduct on
commercial premises open to the adult public falls within a State's broad power
to regulate commerce and protect the public environment. The issue in this
context goes beyond whether someone, or even the majority, considers the
conduct depicted as "wrong" or "sinful." The States have the power to make a
morally neutral judgment that public exhibition of obscene material, or
commerce in such material, has a tendency to injure the community as a whole,
to endanger the public safety, or to jeopardize, in Mr. Chief Justice Warren's
words, the States' "right ... to maintain a decent society." Jacobellis v. Ohio
(dissenting opinion).
*** In light of these holdings, nothing precludes the State of Georgia from the
regulation of the allegedly obscene material exhibited in Paris Adult Theatre I or
II, provided that the applicable Georgia law, as written or authoritatively
interpreted by the Georgia courts, meets the First Amendment standards set
forth in Miller v. California. The judgment is vacated and the case remanded to
the Georgia Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion and Miller v. California.
Vacated and remanded.
JUSTICE DOUGLAS, DISSENTING.
*** When man was first in the jungle he took care of himself. When he entered a
societal group, controls were necessarily imposed. But our society—unlike most
in the world—presupposes that freedom and liberty are in a frame of reference
that makes the individual, not government, the keeper of his tastes, beliefs, and
ideas. That is the philosophy of the First Amendment; and it is the article of
faith that sets us apart from most nations in the world.

JUSTICE BRENNAN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEWART AND JUSTICE MARSHALL JOIN,
DISSENTING.
This case requires the Court to confront once again the vexing problem of
reconciling state efforts to suppress sexually oriented expression with the
protections of the First Amendment, as applied to the States through the
Fourteenth Amendment. No other aspect of the First Amendment has, in recent
years, demanded so substantial a commitment of our time, generated such
disharmony of views, and remained so resistant to the formulation of stable and
manageable standards. I am convinced that the approach initiated 16 years ago
in Roth v. United States (1957), and culminating in the Court's decision today,
cannot bring stability to this area of the law without jeopardizing fundamental
First Amendment values, and I have concluded that the time has come to make
a significant departure from that approach. ***

Note	  
1.
In addition to retreating from any broad interpretation of Stanley v.
Georgia in Paris Adult Theatre I, the Court also exempted “child
pornography” from Stanley’s protection of the home in Osborne v. Ohio,
495 U.S. 103 (1990).
The threshold question in this case is whether Ohio may constitutionally
proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography or whether, as
Osborne argues, our decision in Stanley v. Georgia (1969), compels the contrary
result. In Stanley, we struck down a Georgia law outlawing the private
possession of obscene material. We recognized that the statute impinged upon
Stanley's right to receive information in the privacy of his home, and we found
Georgia's justifications for its law inadequate.
Stanley should not be read too broadly. We have previously noted that Stanley
was a narrow holding, see United States v. 12 200–ft. Reels of Film (1973), and,
since the decision in that case, the value of permitting child pornography has
been characterized as “exceedingly modest, if not de minimis.” New York v.
Ferber (1982). But assuming, for the sake of argument, that Osborne has a First
Amendment interest in viewing and possessing child pornography, we
nonetheless find this case distinct from Stanley because the interests underlying
child pornography prohibitions far exceed the interests justifying the Georgia
law at issue in Stanley. Every court to address the issue has so concluded.

Why should “child pornography” have different constitutional status?
Child pornography is further discussed in a following subsection.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR ANNOUNCED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT AND DELIVERED THE
OPINION OF THE COURT WITH RESPECT TO PARTS I AND II, AND AN OPINION WITH
RESPECT TO PARTS III AND IV, IN WHICH THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE KENNEDY, AND
JUSTICE BREYER JOIN.
The city of Erie, Pennsylvania, enacted an ordinance banning public nudity.
Respondent Pap's A. M. (hereinafter Pap's), which operated a nude dancing
establishment in Erie, challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance and
sought a permanent injunction against its enforcement. The Pennsylvania
Supreme Court, although noting that this Court in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.,
(1991), had upheld an Indiana ordinance that was "strikingly similar" to Erie's,
found that the public nudity sections of the ordinance violated respondent's
right to freedom of expression under the United States Constitution. This case
raises the question whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court properly
evaluated the ordinance's constitutionality under the First Amendment. We
hold that Erie's ordinance is a content-neutral regulation that satisfies the fourpart test of United States v. O'Brien (1968). Accordingly, we reverse the decision
of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and remand for the consideration of any
remaining issues.
I
On September 28, 1994, the city council for the city of Erie, Pennsylvania,
enacted Ordinance 75-1994, a public indecency ordinance that makes it a
summary offense to knowingly or intentionally appear in public in a "state of
nudity." Respondent Pap's, a Pennsylvania corporation, operated an
establishment in Erie known as "Kandyland" that featured totally nude erotic
dancing performed by women. To comply with the ordinance, these dancers
must wear, at a minimum, "pasties" and a "G-string." On October 14, 1994, two
days after the ordinance went into effect, Pap's filed a complaint against the city
of Erie, the mayor of the city, and members of the city council, seeking
declaratory relief and a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the
ordinance.
The Court of Common Pleas of Erie County granted the permanent injunction
and struck down the ordinance as unconstitutional. On cross appeals, the
Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court's order.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted review and reversed, concluding that
the public nudity provisions of the ordinance violated respondent's rights to

Robson

813

The First Amendment

freedom of expression as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
The Pennsylvania court first inquired whether nude dancing constitutes
expressive conduct that is within the protection of the First Amendment. The
court noted that the act of being nude, in and of itself, is not entitled to First
Amendment protection because it conveys no message. Nude dancing, however,
is expressive conduct that is entitled to some quantum of protection under the
First Amendment, a view that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted was
endorsed by eight Members of this Court in Barnes.
The Pennsylvania court next inquired whether the government interest in
enacting the ordinance was content neutral, explaining that regulations that
are unrelated to the suppression of expression are not subject to strict scrutiny
but to the less stringent standard of United States v. O'Brien. To answer the
question whether the ordinance is content based, the court turned to our
decision in Barnes. Although the Pennsylvania court noted that the Indiana
statute at issue in Barnes "is strikingly similar to the Ordinance we are
examining," it concluded that "[u]nfortunately for our purposes, the Barnes
Court splintered and produced four separate, non-harmonious opinions." After
canvassing these separate opinions, the Pennsylvania court concluded that,
although it is permissible to find precedential effect in a fragmented decision, to
do so a majority of the Court must have been in agreement on the concept that
is deemed to be the holding. The Pennsylvania court noted that "aside from the
agreement by a majority of the Barnes Court that nude dancing is entitled to
some First Amendment protection, we can find no point on which a majority of
the Barnes Court agreed." Accordingly, the court concluded that "no clear
precedent arises out of Barnes on the issue of whether the [Erie] ordinance . . .
passes muster under the First Amendment."
Having determined that there was no United States Supreme Court precedent
on point, the Pennsylvania court conducted an independent examination of the
ordinance to ascertain whether it was related to the suppression of expression.
The court concluded that although one of the purposes of the ordinance was to
combat negative secondary effects, "[i]nextricably bound up with this stated
purpose is an unmentioned purpose . . . to impact negatively on the erotic
message of the dance." As such, the court determined the ordinance was
content based and subject to strict scrutiny. The ordinance failed the narrow
tailoring requirement of strict scrutiny because the court found that imposing
criminal and civil sanctions on those who commit sex crimes would be a far
narrower means of combating secondary effects than the requirement that
dancers wear pasties and G-strings.
*** The city of Erie petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we granted. Shortly
thereafter, Pap's filed a motion to dismiss the case as moot, noting that
Kandyland was no longer operating as a nude dancing club, and Pap's was not
operating a nude dancing club at any other location. We denied the motion.
II
As a preliminary matter, we must address the justiciability question. ***
In any event, this is not a run of the mill voluntary cessation case. Here it is the
plaintiff who, having prevailed below, now seeks to have the case declared moot.
And it is the city of Erie that seeks to invoke the federal judicial power to obtain

Robson

814

The First Amendment

this Court's review of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision. *** Our
interest in preventing litigants from attempting to manipulate the Court's
jurisdiction to insulate a favorable decision from review further counsels
against a finding of mootness here. Although the issue is close, we conclude
that the case is not moot, and we turn to the merits.
III
Being "in a state of nudity" is not an inherently expressive condition. As we
explained in Barnes, however, nude dancing of the type at issue here is
expressive conduct, although we think that it falls only within the outer ambit
of the First Amendment's protection. See Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. (plurality
opinion).
To determine what level of scrutiny applies to the ordinance at issue here, we
must decide "whether the State's regulation is related to the suppression of
expression." Texas v. Johnson (1989); see also United States v. O'Brien. If the
governmental purpose in enacting the regulation is unrelated to the
suppression of expression, then the regulation need only satisfy the "less
stringent" standard from O'Brien for evaluating restrictions on symbolic speech.
If the government interest is related to the content of the expression, however,
then the regulation falls outside the scope of the O'Brien test and must be
justified under a more demanding standard. Texas v. Johnson.
In Barnes, we analyzed an almost identical statute, holding that Indiana's
public nudity ban did not violate the First Amendment, although no five
Members of the Court agreed on a single rationale for that conclusion. We now
clarify that government restrictions on public nudity such as the ordinance at
issue here should be evaluated under the framework set forth in O'Brien for
content-neutral restrictions on symbolic speech.
The city of Erie argues that the ordinance is a content neutral restriction that is
reviewable under O'Brien because the ordinance bans conduct, not speech;
specifically, public nudity. Respondent counters that the ordinance targets
nude dancing and, as such, is aimed specifically at suppressing expression,
making the ordinance a content-based restriction that must be subjected to
strict scrutiny.
The ordinance here, like the statute in Barnes, is on its face a general
prohibition on public nudity. By its terms, the ordinance regulates conduct
alone. It does not target nudity that contains an erotic message; rather, it bans
all public nudity, regardless of whether that nudity is accompanied by
expressive activity. And like the statute in Barnes, the Erie ordinance replaces
and updates provisions of an "Indecency and Immorality" ordinance that has
been on the books since 1866, predating the prevalence of nude dancing
establishments such as Kandyland.
Respondent and Justice Stevens contend nonetheless that the ordinance is
related to the suppression of expression because language in the ordinance's
preamble suggests that its actual purpose is to prohibit erotic dancing of the
type performed at Kandyland. That is not how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
interpreted that language, however. In the preamble to the ordinance, the city
council stated that it was adopting the regulation

Robson

815

The First Amendment

"`for the purpose of limiting a recent increase in nude live entertainment within
the City, which activity adversely impacts and threatens to impact on the public
health, safety and welfare by providing an atmosphere conducive to violence,
sexual harassment, public intoxication, prostitution, the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases and other deleterious effects.'"
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court construed this language to mean that one
purpose of the ordinance was "to combat negative secondary effects."
As Justice Souter noted in Barnes, "on its face, the governmental interest in
combating prostitution and other criminal activity is not at all inherently
related to expression." (opinion concurring in judgment). In that sense, this
case is similar to O'Brien. O'Brien burned his draft registration card as a public
statement of his antiwar views, and he was convicted under a statute making it
a crime to knowingly mutilate or destroy such a card. This Court rejected his
claim that the statute violated his First Amendment rights, reasoning that the
law punished him for the "noncommunicative impact of his conduct, and for
nothing else." In other words, the Government regulation prohibiting the
destruction of draft cards was aimed at maintaining the integrity of the
Selective Service System and not at suppressing the message of draft resistance
that O'Brien sought to convey by burning his draft card. So too here, the
ordinance prohibiting public nudity is aimed at combating crime and other
negative secondary effects caused by the presence of adult entertainment
establishments like Kandyland and not at suppressing the erotic message
conveyed by this type of nude dancing. Put another way, the ordinance does not
attempt to regulate the primary effects of the expression, i. e., the effect on the
audience of watching nude erotic dancing, but rather the secondary effects,
such as the impacts on public health, safety, and welfare, which we have
previously recognized are "caused by the presence of even one such"
establishment. Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. (1986).
Although the Pennsylvania Supreme Court acknowledged that one goal of the
ordinance was to combat the negative secondary effects associated with nude
dancing establishments, the court concluded that the ordinance was
nevertheless content based, relying on Justice White's position in dissent in
Barnes for the proposition that a ban of this type necessarily has the purpose of
suppressing the erotic message of the dance. Because the Pennsylvania court
agreed with Justice White's approach, it concluded that the ordinance must
have another, "unmentioned" purpose related to the suppression of expression.
That is, the Pennsylvania court adopted the dissent's view in Barnes that
"`[s]ince the State permits the dancers to perform if they wear pasties and Gstrings but forbids nude dancing, it is precisely because of the distinctive,
expressive content of the nude dancing performances at issue in this case that
the State seeks to apply the statutory prohibition." A majority of the Court
rejected that view in Barnes, and we do so again here.
Respondent's argument that the ordinance is "aimed" at suppressing expression
through a ban on nude dancing—an argument that respondent supports by
pointing to statements by the city attorney that the public nudity ban was not
intended to apply to "legitimate" theater productions— is really an argument
that the city council also had an illicit motive in enacting the ordinance. As we

Robson

816

The First Amendment

have said before, however, this Court will not strike down an otherwise
constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit motive. ***
Justice Stevens argues that the ordinance enacts a complete ban on expression.
We respectfully disagree with that characterization. The public nudity ban
certainly has the effect of limiting one particular means of expressing the kind
of erotic message being disseminated at Kandyland. But simply to define what
is being banned as the "message" is to assume the conclusion. We did not
analyze the regulation in O'Brien as having enacted a total ban on expression.
Instead, the Court recognized that the regulation against destroying one's draft
card was justified by the Government's interest in preventing the harmful
"secondary effects" of that conduct (disruption to the Selective Service System),
even though that regulation may have some incidental effect on the expressive
element of the conduct. Because this justification was unrelated to the
suppression of O'Brien's antiwar message, the regulation was content neutral.
Although there may be cases in which banning the means of expression so
interferes with the message that it essentially bans the message, that is not the
case here.
Even if we had not already rejected the view that a ban on public nudity is
necessarily related to the suppression of the erotic message of nude dancing, we
would do so now because the premise of such a view is flawed. The State's
interest in preventing harmful secondary effects is not related to the
suppression of expression. In trying to control the secondary effects of nude
dancing, the ordinance seeks to deter crime and the other deleterious effects
caused by the presence of such an establishment in the neighborhood. In Clark
v. Community for Creative Non-Violence (1984), we held that a National Park
Service regulation prohibiting camping in certain parks did not violate the First
Amendment when applied to prohibit demonstrators from sleeping in Lafayette
Park and the Mall in Washington, D. C., in connection with a demonstration
intended to call attention to the plight of the homeless. Assuming, arguendo,
that sleeping can be expressive conduct, the Court concluded that the
Government interest in conserving park property was unrelated to the
demonstrators' message about homelessness. So, while the demonstrators were
allowed to erect "symbolic tent cities," they were not allowed to sleep overnight
in those tents. Even though the regulation may have directly limited the
expressive element involved in actually sleeping in the park, the regulation was
nonetheless content neutral.
Similarly, even if Erie's public nudity ban has some minimal effect on the erotic
message by muting that portion of the expression that occurs when the last
stitch is dropped, the dancers at Kandyland and other such establishments are
free to perform wearing pasties and G-strings. Any effect on the overall
expression is de minimis. And as Justice Stevens eloquently stated for the
plurality in Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc. (1976), "even though we
recognize that the First Amendment will not tolerate the total suppression of
erotic materials that have some arguably artistic value, it is manifest that
society's interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly different,
and lesser, magnitude than the interest in untrammeled political debate," and
"few of us would march our sons and daughters off to war to preserve the
citizen's right to see" specified anatomical areas exhibited at establishments like

The First Amendment

Kandyland. If States are to be able to regulate secondary effects, then de
minimis intrusions on expression such as those at issue here cannot be
sufficient to render the ordinance content based.
This case is, in fact, similar to O'Brien, Community for Creative Non-Violence,
and Ward [ v/ Rock Against Racism (1989)]. The justification for the government
regulation in each case prevents harmful "secondary" effects that are unrelated
to the suppression of expression. While the doctrinal theories behind "incidental
burdens" and "secondary effects" are, of course, not identical, there is nothing
objectionable about a city passing a general ordinance to ban public nudity
(even though such a ban may place incidental burdens on some protected
speech) and at the same time recognizing that one specific occurrence of public
nudity— nude erotic dancing—is particularly problematic because it produces
harmful secondary effects.
Justice Stevens claims that today we "[f]or the first time" extend Renton `s
secondary effects doctrine to justify restrictions other than the location of a
commercial enterprise. Our reliance on Renton to justify other restrictions is not
new, however. In Ward, the Court relied on Renton to evaluate restrictions on
sound amplification at an outdoor bandshell, rejecting the dissent's contention
that Renton was inapplicable. Moreover, Erie's ordinance does not effect a "total
ban" on protected expression.
In Renton, the regulation explicitly treated "adult" movie theaters differently
from other theaters, and defined "adult" theaters solely by reference to the
content of their movies. We nonetheless treated the zoning regulation as
content neutral because the ordinance was aimed at the secondary effects of
adult theaters, a justification unrelated to the content of the adult movies
themselves. Here, Erie's ordinance is on its face a content-neutral restriction on
conduct. Even if the city thought that nude dancing at clubs like Kandyland
constituted a particularly problematic instance of public nudity, the regulation
is still properly evaluated as a content-neutral restriction because the interest
in combating the secondary effects associated with those clubs is unrelated to
the suppression of the erotic message conveyed by nude dancing.
We conclude that Erie's asserted interest in combating the negative secondary
effects associated with adult entertainment establishments like Kandyland is
unrelated to the suppression of the erotic message conveyed by nude dancing.
The ordinance prohibiting public nudity is therefore valid if it satisfies the fourfactor test from O'Brien for evaluating restrictions on symbolic speech.
IV
Applying that standard here, we conclude that Erie's ordinance is justified
under O'Brien. The first factor of the O'Brien test is whether the government
regulation is within the constitutional power of the government to enact. Here,
Erie's efforts to protect public health and safety are clearly within the city's
police powers. The second factor is whether the regulation furthers an
important or substantial government interest. The asserted interests of
regulating conduct through a public nudity ban and of combating the harmful
secondary effects associated with nude dancing are undeniably important. And
in terms of demonstrating that such secondary effects pose a threat, the city
need not "conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already

Robson

818

The First Amendment

generated by other cities" to demonstrate the problem of secondary effects, "so
long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be
relevant to the problem that the city addresses." Because the nude dancing at
Kandyland is of the same character as the adult entertainment at issue in
Renton; Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc. (1976); and California v. LaRue
(1972), it was reasonable for Erie to conclude that such nude dancing was likely
to produce the same secondary effects. And Erie could reasonably rely on the
evidentiary foundation set forth in Renton and American Mini Theatres to the
effect that secondary effects are caused by the presence of even one adult
entertainment establishment in a given neighborhood. In fact, Erie expressly
relied on Barnes and its discussion of secondary effects, including its reference
to Renton and American Mini Theatres. Even in cases addressing regulations
that strike closer to the core of First Amendment values, we have accepted a
state or local government's reasonable belief that the experience of other
jurisdictions is relevant to the problem it is addressing. Regardless of whether
Justice Souter now wishes to disavow his opinion in Barnes on this point
(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), the evidentiary standard
described in Renton controls here, and Erie meets that standard.
In any event, Erie also relied on its own findings. The preamble to the ordinance
states that "the Council of the City of Erie has, at various times over more than a
century, expressed its findings that certain lewd, immoral activities carried on in
public places for profit are highly detrimental to the public health, safety and
welfare, and lead to the debasement of both women and men, promote violence,
public intoxication, prostitution and other serious criminal activity." The city
council members, familiar with commercial downtown Erie, are the individuals
who would likely have had firsthand knowledge of what took place at and
around nude dancing establishments in Erie, and can make particularized,
expert judgments about the resulting harmful secondary effects. Analogizing to
the administrative agency context, it is well established that, as long as a party
has an opportunity to respond, an administrative agency may take official
notice of such "legislative facts" within its special knowledge, and is not
confined to the evidence in the record in reaching its expert judgment. Here,
Kandyland has had ample opportunity to contest the council's findings about
secondary effects—before the council itself, throughout the state proceedings,
and before this Court. Yet to this day, Kandyland has never challenged the city
council's findings or cast any specific doubt on the validity of those findings.
Instead, it has simply asserted that the council's evidentiary proof was lacking.
In the absence of any reason to doubt it, the city's expert judgment should be
credited. And the study relied on by amicus curiae does not cast any legitimate
doubt on the Erie city council's judgment about Erie.
Finally, it is worth repeating that Erie's ordinance is on its face a contentneutral restriction that regulates conduct, not First Amendment expression.
And the government should have sufficient leeway to justify such a law based
on secondary effects. On this point, O'Brien is especially instructive. The Court
there did not require evidence that the integrity of the Selective Service System
would be jeopardized by the knowing destruction or mutilation of draft cards.
***

Robson

819

The First Amendment

Justice Souter, however, would require Erie to develop a specific evidentiary
record supporting its ordinance (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in
part). *** In any event, Justice Souter conflates two distinct concepts under
O'Brien: whether there is a substantial government interest and whether the
regulation furthers that interest. As to the government interest, i. e., whether
the threatened harm is real, the city council relied on this Court's opinions
detailing the harmful secondary effects caused by establishments like
Kandyland, as well as on its own experiences in Erie. Justice Souter attempts to
denigrate the city council's conclusion that the threatened harm was real,
arguing that we cannot accept Erie's findings because the subject of nude
dancing is "fraught with some emotionalism.” Yet surely the subject of drafting
our citizens into the military is "fraught" with more emotionalism than the
subject of regulating nude dancing. ***
As to the second point—whether the regulation furthers the government
interest—it is evident that, since crime and other public health and safety
problems are caused by the presence of nude dancing establishments like
Kandyland, a ban on such nude dancing would further Erie's interest in
preventing such secondary effects. To be sure, requiring dancers to wear pasties
and G-strings may not greatly reduce these secondary effects, but O'Brien
requires only that the regulation further the interest in combating such effects.
Even though the dissent questions the wisdom of Erie's chosen remedy (opinion
of Stevens, J.), the "`city must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to
experiment with solutions to admittedly serious problems,' " Renton v. Playtime
Theatres, Inc. (quoting American Mini Theatres (plurality opinion)). It also may be
true that a pasties and G-string requirement would not be as effective as, for
example, a requirement that the dancers be fully clothed, but the city must
balance its efforts to address the problem with the requirement that the
restriction be no greater than necessary to further the city's interest.
The ordinance also satisfies O'Brien's third factor, that the government interest
is unrelated to the suppression of free expression. The fourth and final O'Brien
factor—that the restriction is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of
the government interest— is satisfied as well. The ordinance regulates conduct,
and any incidental impact on the expressive element of nude dancing is de
minimis. The requirement that dancers wear pasties and G-strings is a minimal
restriction in furtherance of the asserted government interests, and the
restriction leaves ample capacity to convey the dancer's erotic message. See
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. (plurality opinion of Rehnquist, C. J., joined by
O'Connor and Kennedy, JJ.); (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). Justice
Souter points out that zoning is an alternative means of addressing this
problem. It is far from clear, however, that zoning imposes less of a burden on
expression than the minimal requirement implemented here. In any event, since
this is a content-neutral restriction, least restrictive means analysis is not
required.
We hold, therefore, that Erie's ordinance is a content neutral regulation that is
valid under O'Brien. Accordingly, the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
It is so ordered.

The First Amendment

JUSTICE SCALIA, WITH WHOM JUSTICE THOMAS JOINS, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
I
In my view, the case before us here is moot. ***
II
For the reasons set forth above, I would dismiss this case for want of
jurisdiction. Because the Court resolves the threshold mootness question
differently and proceeds to address the merits, I will do so briefly as well. I agree
that the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court must be reversed, but
disagree with the mode of analysis the Court has applied.
The city of Erie self-consciously modeled its ordinance on the public nudity
statute we upheld against constitutional challenge in Barnes v. Glen Theatre,
Inc. (1991), calculating (one would have supposed reasonably) that the courts of
Pennsylvania would consider themselves bound by our judgment on a question
of federal constitutional law. In Barnes, I voted to uphold the challenged
Indiana statute "not because it survives some lower level of First Amendment
scrutiny, but because, as a general law regulating conduct and not specifically
directed at expression, it is not subject to First Amendment scrutiny at all."
(opinion concurring in judgment). Erie's ordinance, too, by its terms prohibits
not merely nude dancing, but the act— irrespective of whether it is engaged in
for expressive purposes—of going nude in public. The facts that a preamble to
the ordinance explains that its purpose, in part, is to "limi[t] a recent increase
in nude live entertainment," that city council members in supporting the
ordinance commented to that effect, and that the ordinance includes in the
definition of nudity the exposure of devices simulating that condition, neither
make the law any less general in its reach nor demonstrate that what the
municipal authorities really find objectionable is expression rather than public
nakedness. As far as appears (and as seems overwhelmingly likely), the
preamble, the councilmembers' comments, and the chosen definition of the
prohibited conduct simply reflect the fact that Erie had recently been having a
public nudity problem not with streakers, sunbathers, or hot dog vendors, see
Barnes (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), but with lap dancers.
There is no basis for the contention that the ordinance does not apply to nudity
in theatrical productions such as Equus or Hair. Its text contains no such
limitation. It was stipulated in the trial court that no effort was made to enforce
the ordinance against a production of Equus involving nudity that was being
staged in Erie at the time the ordinance became effective. Notwithstanding
Justice Stevens' assertion to the contrary, however, neither in the stipulation,
nor elsewhere in the record, does it appear that the city was aware of the
nudity—and before this Court counsel for the city attributed nonenforcement
not to a general exception for theatrical productions, but to the fact that no one
had complained. One instance of nonenforcement—against a play already in
production
that
prosecutorial
discretion
might
reasonably
have
"grandfathered"—does not render this ordinance discriminatory on its face. To
be sure, in the trial court counsel for the city said that "[t]o the extent that the
expressive activity that is contained in [such] productions rises to a higher level
of protected expression, they would not be [covered],"—but he rested this

Robson

821

The First Amendment

assertion upon the provision in the preamble that expressed respect for
"fundamental Constitutional guarantees of free speech and free expression,"
and the provision of Paragraph 6 of the ordinance that provided for severability
of unconstitutional provisions. What he was saying there (in order to fend off
the overbreadth challenge of respondent, who was in no doubt that the
ordinance did cover theatrical productions) was essentially what he said at oral
argument before this Court: that the ordinance would not be enforceable
against theatrical productions if the Constitution forbade it. Surely that
limitation does not cause the ordinance to be not generally applicable, in the
relevant sense of being targeted against expressive conduct.
Moreover, even were I to conclude that the city of Erie had specifically singled
out the activity of nude dancing, I still would not find that this regulation
violated the First Amendment unless I could be persuaded (as on this record I
cannot) that it was the communicative character of nude dancing that
prompted the ban. When conduct other than speech itself is regulated, it is my
view that the First Amendment is violated only "[w]here the government
prohibits conduct precisely because of its communicative attributes." Barnes
(emphasis deleted). Here, even if one hypothesizes that the city's object was to
suppress only nude dancing, that would not establish an intent to suppress
what (if anything) nude dancing communicates. I do not feel the need, as the
Court does, to identify some "secondary effects" associated with nude dancing
that the city could properly seek to eliminate. (I am highly skeptical, to tell the
truth, that the addition of pasties and G-strings will at all reduce the tendency
of establishments such as Kandyland to attract crime and prostitution, and
hence to foster sexually transmitted disease.) The traditional power of
government to foster good morals (bonos mores), and the acceptability of the
traditional judgment (if Erie wishes to endorse it) that nude public dancing itself
is immoral, have not been repealed by the First Amendment.
JUSTICE SOUTER, CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART.
I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion and agree with the analytical
approach that the plurality employs in deciding this case. Erie's stated interest
in combating the secondary effects associated with nude dancing
establishments is an interest unrelated to the suppression of expression under
United States v. O'Brien (1968), and the city's regulation is thus properly
considered under the O'Brien standards. I do not believe, however, that the
current record allows us to say that the city has made a sufficient evidentiary
showing to sustain its regulation, and I would therefore vacate the decision of
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and remand the case for further proceedings.
I
In several recent cases, we have confronted the need for factual justifications to
satisfy intermediate scrutiny under the First Amendment. Those cases do not
identify with any specificity a particular quantum of evidence, nor do I seek to
do so in this brief concurrence. What the cases do make plain, however, is that
application of an intermediate scrutiny test to a government's asserted rationale
for regulation of expressive activity demands some factual justification to
connect that rationale with the regulation in issue.

Robson

822

The First Amendment

*** The focus on evidence appearing in the record is consistent with the
approach earlier applied in Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc. (1976) and
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. (1986). In Young, Detroit adopted a zoning
ordinance requiring dispersal of adult theaters through the city and prohibiting
them within 500 feet of a residential area. Urban planners and real estate
experts attested to the harms created by clusters of such theaters, and we
found that "[t]he record discloses a factual basis" supporting the efficacy of
Detroit's chosen remedy. In Renton, the city similarly enacted a zoning
ordinance requiring specified distances between adult theaters and residential
zones, churches, parks, or schools. The city "held public hearings, reviewed the
experiences of Seattle and other cities, and received a report from the City
Attorney's Office advising as to developments in other cities." We found that
Renton's failure to conduct its own studies before enacting the ordinance was
not fatal; "[t]he First Amendment does not require a city . . . to conduct new
studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other
cities, so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to
be relevant to the problem that the city addresses."
The upshot of these cases is that intermediate scrutiny requires a regulating
government to make some demonstration of an evidentiary basis for the harm it
claims to flow from the expressive activity, and for the alleviation expected from
the restriction imposed. That evidentiary basis may be borrowed from the
records made by other governments if the experience elsewhere is germane to
the measure under consideration and actually relied upon. I will assume,
further, that the reliance may be shown by legislative invocation of a judicial
opinion that accepted an evidentiary foundation as sufficient for a similar
regulation. What is clear is that the evidence of reliance must be a matter of
demonstrated fact, not speculative supposition.
By these standards, the record before us today is deficient in its failure to reveal
any evidence on which Erie may have relied, either for the seriousness of the
threatened harm or for the efficacy of its chosen remedy. The plurality does the
best it can with the materials to hand, but the pickings are slim. The plurality
quotes the ordinance's preamble asserting that over the course of more than a
century the city council had expressed "findings" of detrimental secondary
effects flowing from lewd and immoral profitmaking activity in public places.
But however accurate the recital may be and however honestly the councilors
may have held those conclusions to be true over the years, the recitation does
not get beyond conclusions on a subject usually fraught with some
emotionalism. The plurality recognizes this, of course, but seeks to ratchet up
the value of mere conclusions by analogizing them to the legislative facts within
an administrative agency's special knowledge, on which action is adequately
premised in the absence of evidentiary challenge. The analogy is not obvious;
agencies are part of the executive branch and we defer to them in part to allow
them the freedom necessary to reconcile competing policies. See Chevron U. S. A.
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984). *** As to current fact, the
city council's closest approach to an evidentiary record on secondary effects and
their causes was the statement of one councilor, during the debate over the
ordinance, who spoke of increases in sex crimes in a way that might be
construed as a reference to secondary effects. But that reference came at the
end of a litany of concerns ("free condoms in schools, drive-by shootings,

Robson

823

The First Amendment

abortions, suicide machines," and declining student achievement test scores)
that do not seem to be secondary effects of nude dancing. Nor does the
invocation of Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. (1991), in one paragraph of the
preamble to Erie's ordinance suffice. The plurality opinion in Barnes made no
mention of evidentiary showings at all, and though my separate opinion did
make a pass at the issue, I did not demand reliance on germane evidentiary
demonstrations, whether specific to the statute in question or developed
elsewhere. To invoke Barnes, therefore, does not indicate that the issue of
evidence has been addressed.
There is one point, however, on which an evidentiary record is not quite so hard
to find, but it hurts, not helps, the city. The final O'Brien requirement is that
the incidental speech restriction be shown to be no greater than essential to
achieve the government's legitimate purpose. To deal with this issue, we have to
ask what basis there is to think that the city would be unsuccessful in
countering any secondary effects by the significantly lesser restriction of zoning
to control the location of nude dancing, thus allowing for efficient law
enforcement, restricting effects on property values, and limiting exposure of the
public. The record shows that for 23 years there has been a zoning ordinance
on the books to regulate the location of establishments like Kandyland, but the
city has not enforced it. One councilor remarked that "I think there's one of the
problems. The ordinances are on the books and not enforced. Now this takes
place. You really didn't need any other ordinances." Another commented, "I felt
very, very strongly, and I feel just as strongly right now, that this is a zoning
matter." Even on the plurality's view of the evidentiary burden, this hurdle to
the application of O'Brien requires an evidentiary response.
*** Careful readers, and not just those on the Erie City Council, will of course
realize that my partial dissent rests on a demand for an evidentiary basis that I
failed to make when I concurred in Barnes. I should have demanded the
evidence then, too, and my mistake calls to mind Justice Jackson's foolproof
explanation of a lapse of his own, when he quoted Samuel Johnson, "`Ignorance,
sir, ignorance.' " McGrath v. Kristensen (1950) (concurring opinion). I may not be
less ignorant of nude dancing than I was nine years ago, but after many
subsequent occasions to think further about the needs of the First Amendment,
I have come to believe that a government must toe the mark more carefully than
I first insisted. I hope it is enlightenment on my part, and acceptable even if a
little late.
II
The record before us now does not permit the conclusion that Erie's ordinance
is reasonably designed to mitigate real harms. This does not mean that the
required showing cannot be made, only that, on this record, Erie has not made
it. I would remand to give it the opportunity to do so. Accordingly, although I
join with the plurality in adopting the O'Brien test, I respectfully dissent from
the Court's disposition of the case.
JUSTICE STEVENS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE GINSBURG JOINS, DISSENTING.
Far more important than the question whether nude dancing is entitled to the
protection of the First Amendment are the dramatic changes in legal doctrine

Robson

824

The First Amendment

that the Court endorses today. Until now, the "secondary effects" of commercial
enterprises featuring indecent entertainment have justified only the regulation
of their location. For the first time, the Court has now held that such effects
may justify the total suppression of protected speech. Indeed, the plurality
opinion concludes that admittedly trivial advancements of a State's interests
may provide the basis for censorship. The Court's commendable attempt to
replace the fractured decision in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. (1991), with a
single coherent rationale is strikingly unsuccessful; it is supported neither by
precedent nor by persuasive reasoning.
I
As the preamble to Ordinance No. 75-1994 candidly acknowledges, the council
of the city of Erie enacted the restriction at issue "for the purpose of limiting a
recent increase in nude live entertainment within the City." Prior to the
enactment of the ordinance, the dancers at Kandyland performed in the nude.
As the Court recognizes, after its enactment they can perform precisely the
same dances if they wear "pasties and G-strings." In both instances, the erotic
messages conveyed by the dancers to a willing audience are a form of
expression protected by the First Amendment. Despite the similarity between
the messages conveyed by the two forms of dance, they are not identical.
If we accept Chief Judge Posner's evaluation of this art form, see Miller v. South
Bend, 904 F. 2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1990) (en banc), the difference between the two
messages is significant. The plurality assumes, however, that the difference in
the content of the message resulting from the mandated costume change is "de
minimis. " Although I suspect that the patrons of Kandyland are more likely to
share Chief Judge Posner's view than the plurality's, for present purposes I
shall accept the assumption that the difference in the message is small. The
crucial point to remember, however, is that whether one views the difference as
large or small, nude dancing still receives First Amendment protection, even if
that protection lies only in the "outer ambit" of that Amendment. Erie's
ordinance, therefore, burdens a message protected by the First Amendment. If
one assumes that the same erotic message is conveyed by nude dancers as by
those wearing miniscule costumes, one means of expressing that message is
banned; if one assumes that the messages are different, one of those messages
is banned. In either event, the ordinance is a total ban.
The plurality relies on the so-called "secondary effects" test to defend the
ordinance. The present use of that rationale, however, finds no support
whatsoever in our precedents. Never before have we approved the use of that
doctrine to justify a total ban on protected First Amendment expression. On the
contrary, we have been quite clear that the doctrine would not support that end.
*** The reason we have limited our secondary effects cases to zoning and
declined to extend their reasoning to total bans is clear and straightforward: A
dispersal that simply limits the places where speech may occur is a minimal
imposition, whereas a total ban is the most exacting of restrictions. The State's
interest in fighting presumed secondary effects is sufficiently strong to justify
the former, but far too weak to support the latter, more severe burden. ***
The Court's use of the secondary effects rationale to permit a total ban has
grave implications for basic free speech principles. Ordinarily, laws regulating

Robson

825

The First Amendment

the primary effects of speech, i. e., the intended persuasive effects caused by the
speech, are presumptively invalid. Under today's opinion, a State may totally
ban speech based on its secondary effects—which are defined as those effects
that "happen to be associated" with speech —yet the regulation is not
presumptively invalid. Because the category of effects that "happen to be
associated" with speech includes the narrower subset of effects caused by
speech, today's holding has the effect of swallowing whole a most fundamental
principle of First Amendment jurisprudence.
II
The plurality's mishandling of our secondary effects cases is not limited to its
approval of a total ban. It compounds that error by dramatically reducing the
degree to which the State's interest must be furthered by the restriction
imposed on speech, and by ignoring the critical difference between secondary
effects caused by speech and the incidental effects on speech that may be
caused by a regulation of conduct.
In what can most delicately be characterized as an enormous understatement,
the plurality concedes that "requiring dancers to wear pasties and G-strings
may not greatly reduce these secondary effects." To believe that the mandatory
addition of pasties and a G-string will have any kind of noticeable impact on
secondary effects requires nothing short of a titanic surrender to the
implausible. It would be more accurate to acknowledge, as Justice Scalia does,
that there is no reason to believe that such a requirement "will at all reduce the
tendency of establishments such as Kandyland to attract crime and prostitution,
and hence to foster sexually transmitted disease." Nevertheless, the plurality
concludes that the "less stringent" test announced in United States v. O'Brien
(1968), "requires only that the regulation further the interest in combating such
effects." It is one thing to say, however, that O'Brien is more lenient than the
"more demanding standard" we have imposed in cases such as Texas v.
Johnson (1989). It is quite another to say that the test can be satisfied by
nothing more than the mere possibility of de minimis effects on the
neighborhood.
The plurality is also mistaken in equating our secondary effects cases with the
"incidental burdens" doctrine applied in cases such as O'Brien; and it
aggravates the error by invoking the latter line of cases to support its assertion
that Erie's ordinance is unrelated to speech. The incidental burdens doctrine
applies when "`speech' and `nonspeech' elements are combined in the same
course of conduct," and the government's interest in regulating the latter
justifies incidental burdens on the former. O'Brien. Secondary effects, on the
other hand, are indirect consequences of protected speech and may justify
regulation of the places where that speech may occur. When a State enacts a
regulation, it might focus on the secondary effects of speech as its aim, or it
might concentrate on nonspeech related concerns, having no thoughts at all
with respect to how its regulation will affect speech—and only later, when the
regulation is found to burden speech, justify the imposition as an unintended
incidental consequence. But those interests are not the same, and the plurality
cannot ignore their differences and insist that both aims are equally unrelated
to speech simply because Erie might have "recogniz[ed]" that it could possibly

Robson

826

The First Amendment

have had either aim in mind. One can think of an apple and an orange at the
same time; that does not turn them into the same fruit.
Of course, the line between governmental interests aimed at conduct and
unrelated to speech, on the one hand, and interests arising out of the effects of
the speech, on the other, may be somewhat imprecise in some cases. In this
case, however, we need not wrestle with any such difficulty because Erie has
expressly justified its ordinance with reference to secondary effects. Indeed, if
Erie's concern with the effects of the message were unrelated to the message
itself, it is strange that the only means used to combat those effects is the
suppression of the message. For these reasons, the plurality's argument that
"this case is similar to O'Brien, " is quite wrong, as are its citations to Clark v.
Community for Creative Non-Violence (1984), and Ward v. Rock Against Racism
(1989), neither of which involved secondary effects. The plurality cannot have
its cake and eat it too—either Erie's ordinance was not aimed at speech and the
plurality may attempt to justify the regulation under the incidental burdens test,
or Erie has aimed its law at the secondary effects of speech, and the plurality
can try to justify the law under that doctrine. But it cannot conflate the two
with the expectation that Erie's interests aimed at secondary effects will be
rendered unrelated to speech by virtue of this doctrinal polyglot.
Correct analysis of the issue in this case should begin with the proposition that
nude dancing is a species of expressive conduct that is protected by the First
Amendment. As Chief Judge Posner has observed, nude dancing fits well within
a broad, cultural tradition recognized as expressive in nature and entitled to
First Amendment protection. The nudity of the dancer is both a component of
the protected expression and the specific target of the ordinance. It is pure
sophistry to reason from the premise that the regulation of the nudity
component of nude dancing is unrelated to the message conveyed by nude
dancers. Indeed, both the text of the ordinance and the reasoning in the
plurality's opinion make it pellucidly clear that the city of Erie has prohibited
nude dancing "precisely because of its communicative attributes." Barnes (Scalia,
J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis in original); Barnes (White, J.,
dissenting).
III
The censorial purpose of Erie's ordinance precludes reliance on the judgment in
Barnes as sufficient support for the Court's holding today. Several differences
between the Erie ordinance and the statute at issue in Barnes belie the
plurality's assertion that the two laws are "almost identical." To begin with, the
preamble to Erie's ordinance candidly articulates its agenda, declaring:
"Council specifically wishes to adopt the concept of Public Indecency prohibited
by the laws of the State of Indiana, which was approved by the U. S. Supreme
Court in Barnes vs. Glen Theatre Inc., . .. for the purpose of limiting a recent
increase in nude live entertainment within the City. " (emphasis added).
As its preamble forthrightly admits, the ordinance's "purpose" is to "limi[t]" a
protected form of speech; its invocation of Barnes cannot obliterate that
professed aim.
Erie's ordinance differs from the statute in Barnes in another respect. In Barnes,
the Court expressly observed that the Indiana statute had not been given a

Robson

827

The First Amendment

limiting construction by the Indiana Supreme Court. As presented to this Court,
there was nothing about the law itself that would confine its application to nude
dancing in adult entertainment establishments. Erie's ordinance, however,
comes to us in a much different posture. In an earlier proceeding in this case,
the Court of Common Pleas asked Erie's counsel "what effect would this
ordinance have on theater . . . productions such as Equus, Hair, O[h!]
Calcutta[!]? Under your ordinance would these things be prevented . .. ?"
Counsel responded: "No, they wouldn't, Your Honor." Indeed, as stipulated in
the record, the city permitted a production of Equus to proceed without
prosecution, even after the ordinance was in effect, and despite its awareness of
the nudity involved in the production. Even if, in light of its broad applicability,
the statute in Barnes was not aimed at a particular form of speech, Erie's
ordinance is quite different. As presented to us, the ordinance is deliberately
targeted at Kandyland's type of nude dancing (to the exclusion of plays like
Equus), in terms of both its applicable scope and the city's enforcement.
This narrow aim is confirmed by the expressed views of the Erie City
Councilmembers who voted for the ordinance. The four city councilmembers
who approved the measure (of the six total councilmembers) each stated his or
her view that the ordinance was aimed specifically at nude adult entertainment,
and not at more mainstream forms of entertainment that include total nudity,
nor even at nudity in general. One lawmaker observed: "We're not talking about
nudity. We're not talking about the theater or art . . . . We're talking about what
is indecent and immoral. . . . We're not prohibiting nudity, we're prohibiting
nudity when it's used in a lewd and immoral fashion." Though not quite as
succinct, the other councilmembers expressed similar convictions. For example,
one member illustrated his understanding of the aim of the law by contrasting
it with his recollection about high school students swimming in the nude in the
school's pool. The ordinance was not intended to cover those incidents of
nudity: "But what I'm getting at is [the swimming] wasn't indecent, it wasn't an
immoral thing, and yet there was nudity." The same lawmaker then disfavorably
compared the nude swimming incident to the activities that occur in "some of
these clubs" that exist in Erie—clubs that would be covered by the law. Though
such comments could be consistent with an interest in a general prohibition of
nudity, the complete absence of commentary on that broader interest, and the
councilmembers' exclusive focus on adult entertainment, is evidence of the
ordinance's aim. In my view, we need not strain to find consistency with more
general purposes when the most natural reading of the record reflects a near
obsessive preoccupation with a single target of the law.
The text of Erie's ordinance is also significantly different from the law upheld in
Barnes. In Barnes, the statute defined "nudity" as "the showing of the human
male or female genitals" (and certain other regions of the body) "with less than a
fully opaque covering." The Erie ordinance duplicates that definition in all
material respects, but adds the following to its definition of "[n]udity":
"`[T]he exposure of any device, costume, or covering which gives the appearance
of or simulates the genitals, pubic hair, natal cleft, perineum anal region or
pubic hair region; or the exposure of any device worn as a cover over the
nipples and/or areola of the female breast, which device simulates and gives the
realistic appearance of nipples and/or areola.' " (emphasis added).

Robson

828

The First Amendment

Can it be doubted that this out-of-the-ordinary definition of "nudity" is aimed
directly at the dancers in establishments such as Kandyland? Who else is likely
to don such garments? We should not stretch to embrace fanciful explanations
when the most natural reading of the ordinance unmistakably identifies its
intended target.
It is clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Erie ordinance was a response
to a more specific concern than nudity in general, namely, nude dancing of the
sort found in Kandyland. Given that the Court has not even tried to defend the
ordinance's total ban on the ground that its censorship of protected speech
might be justified by an overriding state interest, it should conclude that the
ordinance is patently invalid. For these reasons, as well as the reasons set forth
in Justice White's dissent in Barnes, I respectfully dissent.

Notes	  
1.
What is the doctrine of “secondary effects”? How does it relate to
doctrines such as expressive conduct?
2.
The term “secondary effects” originated in a footnote authored by
Justice Stevens. Writing for the Court in the 1976 case of Young v.
American Mini Theatres, Stevens referred to the government’s
determination that a concentration of "adult" movie theaters causes the
area to deteriorate and become a focus of crime, effects which are not
attributable to theaters showing other types of films. He continued, it “is
this secondary effect which these zoning ordinances attempt to avoid, not
the dissemination of ‘offensive’ speech.’ These effects include crime,
prostitution, rape, incest, assaults, public intoxication, and lowered
property values. But as his opinion in Erie v. Pap’s A.M. shows, Stevens
came to disavow the term. In his opinion, Justice Souter, although he
had no part in the term’s invention, also expressed regret at his embrace
of the doctrine. Why do these Justices believe the doctrine is misguided?

In Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968), Justice Brennan began
the opinion for the Court with this issue articulation:
This case presents the question of the constitutionality on its face of a New York
criminal obscenity statute which prohibits the sale to minors under 17 years of
age of material defined to be obscene on the basis of its appeal to them whether
or not it would be obscene to adults.

Robson

829

The First Amendment

The Ginsbergs, operating "Sam's Stationery and Luncheonette" in
Bellmore, Long Island sold some so-called "girlie" magazines to a 16 year
old boy. The New York statute criminalized the knowing sale . . . to a
minor" under 17 of "(a) any picture . . . which depicts nudity . . . and
which is harmful to minors," and "(b) any . . . magazine . . . which
contains . . . [such pictures] . . . and which, taken as a whole, is harmful
to minors."
The Court held that although the material may not have been obscene
under the then-applicable Roth definition as applied to adults,
We do not regard New York's regulation in defining obscenity on the basis of its
appeal to minors under 17 as involving an invasion of such minors'
constitutionally protected freedoms. Rather [the New York statute] simply
adjusts the definition of obscenity "to social realities by permitting the appeal of
this type of material to be assessed in terms of the sexual interests . . ." of such
minors.

Sixteen years later, in New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747(1982), the
Court, in an opinion by Justice White essentially carved out “child
pornography” from the First Amendment.
Before the Court in Ferber was yet another New York statute, this one
prohibiting persons from knowingly promoting a sexual performance by a
child under the age of 16 by distributing material which depicts such a
performance. The statute defined “sexual performance” as any
performance that includes sexual conduct by such a child, and “sexual
conduct” is in turn defined as actual or simulated sexual intercourse,
deviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation, sadomasochistic abuse, or lewd exhibition of the genitals. Note that the
statute encompasses a broader definition than that in the Miller standard.
The bookstore proprietor was convicted under the statute for selling films
depicting young boys masturbating, and the Appellate Division of the
New York Supreme Court affirmed. The New York Court of Appeals
reversed, holding that the statute violated the First Amendment as being
both underinclusive and overbroad. The court reasoned that the statute
could not be construed to include the Miller obscenity standard and
therefore would prohibit the promotion of materials traditionally entitled
to protection under the First Amendment.
The Court reasoned that the standard of Miller v. California for
determining what is legally obscene was not a satisfactory solution for
the child pornography problem; that the advertising and selling of child
pornography is the economic motive and integral part of the production
of such materials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation; the value of
permitting live performances and photographic reproductions of children
engaged in lewd exhibitions is exceedingly modest, if not de minimis; and
recognizing and classifying child pornography as a category of material

Robson

The First Amendment

outside the First Amendment's protection is not incompatible with the
Court's decisions dealing with what speech is unprotected.
“When a definable class of material, such as that covered by the New York
statute, bears so heavily and pervasively on the welfare of children engaged in
its production, the balance of competing interests is clearly struck, and it is
permissible to consider these materials as without the First Amendment's
protection.”

The Court also concluded that the New York statute was not
unconstitutionally overbroad as forbidding the distribution of material
with serious literary, scientific, or educational value, ruling that this is a
“paradigmatic case of a state statute whose legitimate reach dwarfs its
arguably impermissible applications,” and whatever overbreadth may
exist should be cured on a case by case basis.

Note:	  Fleeting	  Expletives	  and	  Fleeting	  Nudity	  on	  
Broadcast	  Television	  
Several incidents of fleeting expletives and nudity and their regulation by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have occupied the Court
in two cases, F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502 (2009)
(Fox I), and F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. _ (2012) (Fox
II).
These cases involved several incidents of fleeting expletives sanctioned by
the FCC. The first incident of fleeting expletives involved the 2002
Billboard Music Awards, broadcast by Fox Television Stations, Inc.,
during which the singer Cher exclaimed during an unscripted acceptance
speech: “I've also had my critics for the last 40 years saying that I was on
my way out every year. Right. So f * * * 'em. The second incident involved
the broadcast of the Billboard Music Awards the next year, 2003, during
which Nicole Richie made the following unscripted remark while
presenting an award: “Have you ever tried to get cow s* * * out of a Prada
purse? It's not so f * * *ing simple.” During the 2003 Golden Globe
Awards, broadcast by NBC, upon winning the award for Best Original
Song, the singer Bono exclaimed: “ ‘This is really, really, f * * * ing
brilliant. Really, really great.’
The FCC also took action against an incident of fleeting nudity that
involved an episode of NYPD Blue, a regular television show broadcast by
ABC Television Network. The episode broadcast on February 25, 2003,
showed the nude buttocks of an adult female character for approximately
seven seconds and for a moment the side of her breast. During the
scene, in which the character was preparing to take a shower, a child
portraying her boyfriend's son entered the bathroom. “A moment of
awkwardness followed.” The FCC determined that, regardless of medical
Robson

831

The First Amendment

definitions, displays of buttocks fell within the category of displays of
sexual or excretory organs because the depiction was “widely associated
with sexual arousal and closely associated by most people with excretory
activities.” The scene was deemed patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, and the Commission determined
that “[t]he female actor's nudity is presented in a manner that clearly
panders to and titillates the audience.”
In Fox I, a divided Court decided an administrative law issue and the
majority concluded that the FCC’s change in its previous policy regarding
enforcement of so-called indecency ban, under which nonrepetitive use of
expletive was per se nonactionable, in favor of context-based approach
which allowed it to treat as actionably indecent even isolated uses of
sexual and excretory words in awards show broadcasts, was neither
arbitrary nor capricious.
In Fox II, a unanimous Court concluded that because the FCC failed to
give Fox or ABC fair notice prior to the broadcasts in question that
fleeting expletives and momentary nudity could be found actionably
indecent, the FCC’s standards as applied to these broadcasts were so
vague as to violate due process.
However, while neither Fox I or Fox II rested on the First Amendment, free
speech issues permeated the cases. Excerpts from the opinions follow.
Fox I
JUSTICE THOMAS, CONCURRING.
I join the Court's opinion, which, as a matter of administrative law, correctly
upholds the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) policy with respect
to indecent broadcast speech under the Administrative Procedure Act. I write
separately, however, to note the questionable viability of the two precedents
that support the FCC's assertion of constitutional authority to regulate the
programming at issue in this case. See Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395
U.S. 367 (1969); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). Red Lion and
Pacifica were unconvincing when they were issued, and the passage of time has
only increased doubt regarding their continued validity. “The text of the First
Amendment makes no distinctions among print, broadcast, and cable media,
but we have done so” in these cases.
In Red Lion, this Court upheld the so-called “fairness doctrine,” a Government
requirement “that discussion of public issues be presented on broadcast
stations, and that each side of those issues must be given fair coverage.” The
decision relied heavily on the scarcity of available broadcast frequencies.
According to the Court, because broadcast spectrum was so scarce, it “could be
regulated and rationalized only by the Government. Without government
control, the medium would be of little use because of the cacophony of
competing voices, none of which could be clearly and predictably heard.” To this
end, the Court concluded that the Government should be “permitted to put

Robson

832

The First Amendment

restraints on licensees in favor of others whose views should be expressed on
this unique medium.” Applying this principle, the Court held that “ [i]t does not
violate the First Amendment to treat licensees given the privilege of using scarce
radio frequencies as proxies for the entire community, obligated to give suitable
time and attention to matters of great public concern.”
Red Lion specifically declined to answer whether the First Amendment
authorized the Government's “refusal to permit the broadcaster to carry a
particular program or to publish his own views[,] ... [or] government censorship
of a particular program.” But then in Pacifica, this Court rejected a challenge to
the FCC's authority to impose sanctions on the broadcast of indecent material.
[In the
plurality opinion], relying on Red Lion, the Court noted that
“broadcasting ... has received the most limited First Amendment protection.”
The Court also emphasized the “uniquely pervasive presence” of the broadcast
media in Americans' lives and the fact that broadcast programming was
“uniquely accessible to children.”
This deep intrusion into the First Amendment rights of broadcasters, which the
Court has justified based only on the nature of the medium, is problematic on
two levels. First, instead of looking to first principles to evaluate the
constitutional question, the Court relied on a set of transitory facts, e.g., the
“scarcity of radio frequencies,” to determine the applicable First Amendment
standard. But the original meaning of the Constitution cannot turn on modern
necessity: “Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were
understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future
legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad.” *** Indeed,
the logical weakness of Red Lion and Pacifica has been apparent for some time:
“It is certainly true that broadcast frequencies are scarce but it is unclear why
that fact justifies content regulation of broadcasting in a way that would be
intolerable if applied to the editorial process of the print media.”
Highlighting the doctrinal incoherence of Red Lion and Pacifica, the Court has
declined to apply the lesser standard of First Amendment scrutiny imposed on
broadcast speech to federal regulation of telephone dial-in services, see Sable
Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC (1989), cable television programming, see
Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC (1994), and the Internet, see Reno v.
American Civil Liberties Union (1997). “There is no justification for this apparent
dichotomy in First Amendment jurisprudence. Whatever the merits of Pacifica
when it was issued [,] ... it makes no sense now.” The justifications relied on by
the Court in Red Lion and Pacifica—“spectrum scarcity, intrusiveness, and
accessibility to children—neither distinguish broadcast from cable, nor explain
the relaxed application of the principles of the First Amendment to broadcast.”
Second, even if this Court's disfavored treatment of broadcasters under the
First Amendment could have been justified at the time of Red Lion and Pacifica,
dramatic technological advances have eviscerated the factual assumptions
underlying those decisions. Broadcast spectrum is significantly less scarce than
it was 40 years ago. As NBC notes, the number of over-the-air broadcast
stations grew from 7,411 in 1969, when Red Lion was issued, to 15,273 by the
end of 2004. And the trend should continue with broadcast television's
imminent switch from analog to digital transmission, which will allow the FCC
to “stack broadcast channels right beside one another along the spectrum, and

Robson

833

The First Amendment

ultimately utilize significantly less than the 400 MHz of spectrum the analog
system absorbs today.”
Moreover, traditional broadcast television and radio are no longer the “uniquely
pervasive” media forms they once were. For most consumers, traditional
broadcast media programming is now bundled with cable or satellite services.
Broadcast and other video programming is also widely available over the
Internet And like radio and television broadcasts, Internet access is now often
freely available over the airwaves and can be accessed by portable computer,
cell phones, and other wireless devices. The extant facts that drove this Court
to subject broadcasters to unique disfavor under the First Amendment simply
do not exist today.
These dramatic changes in factual circumstances might well support a
departure from precedent under the prevailing approach to stare decisis. ***
For all these reasons, I am open to reconsideration of Red Lion and Pacifica in
the proper case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG, DISSENTING.
The mainspring of this case is a Government restriction on spoken words. This
appeal, I recognize, arises under the Administrative Procedure Act. *** The
Commission's bold stride beyond the bounds of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,
(1978), I agree [with Breyer, dissenting] exemplified “arbitrary” and “capricious”
decisionmaking. I write separately only to note that there is no way to hide the
long shadow the First Amendment casts over what the Commission has done.
Today's decision does nothing to diminish that shadow.
More than 30 years ago, a sharply divided Court allowed the FCC to sanction a
midafternoon radio broadcast of comedian George Carlin's 12–minute “Filthy
Words” monologue. Carlin satirized the “original” seven dirty words and
repeated them relentlessly in a variety of colloquialisms. The monologue was
aired as part of a program on contemporary attitudes toward the use of
language. In rejecting the First Amendment challenge, the Court “emphasize[d]
the narrowness of [its] holding.” In this regard, the majority stressed that the
Carlin monologue deliberately repeated the dirty words “over and over again.”
Justice Powell, concurring, described Carlin's speech as “verbal shock
treatment.”
In contrast, the unscripted fleeting expletives at issue here are neither
deliberate nor relentlessly repetitive. Nor does the Commission's policy home in
on expressions used to describe sexual or excretory activities or organs.
Spontaneous utterances used simply to convey an emotion or intensify a
statement fall within the order's compass. Cf. Cohen v. California (1971)
(“[W]ords are often chosen as much for their emotive as their cognitive force. We
cannot sanction the view that the Constitution, while solicitous of the cognitive
content of individual speech, has little or no regard for that emotive function
which, practically speaking, may often be the more important element of the
overall message sought to be communicated.”); Denver Area Ed.
Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring in
part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (a word

categorized as indecent “often is inseparable from the ideas and viewpoints
conveyed, or separable only with loss of truth or expressive power”).
The Pacifica decision, however it might fare on reassessment was tightly
cabined, and for good reason. In dissent, Justice Brennan observed that the
Government should take care before enjoining the broadcast of words or
expressions spoken by many “in our land of cultural pluralism.” That comment,
fitting in the 1970's, is even more potent today. If the reserved constitutional
question reaches this Court, we should be mindful that words unpalatable to
some may be “commonplace” for others, “the stuff of everyday conversations.”

KENNEDY, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH ROBERTS, C.J., AND

OPINION CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT. SOTOMAYOR, J., TOOK NO PART IN THE
CONSIDERATION OR DECISION OF THE CASES.
KENNEDY FOR THE COURT.
It is necessary to make three observations about the scope of this decision.
First, because the Court resolves these cases on fair notice grounds under the
Due Process Clause, it need not address the First Amendment implications of
the Commission's indecency policy. It is argued that this Court's ruling in
Pacifica (and the less rigorous standard of scrutiny it provided for the regulation
of broadcasters), should be overruled because the rationale of that case has
been overtaken by technological change and the wide availability of multiple
other choices for listeners and viewers. The Government for its part maintains
that when it licenses a conventional broadcast spectrum, the public may
assume that the Government has its own interest in setting certain standards.
These arguments need not be addressed here. In light of the Court's holding
that the Commission's policy failed to provide fair notice it is unnecessary to
reconsider Pacifica at this time.
This leads to a second observation. Here, the Court rules that Fox and ABC
lacked notice at the time of their broadcasts that the material they were
broadcasting could be found actionably indecent under then-existing policies.
Given this disposition, it is unnecessary for the Court to address the
constitutionality of the current indecency policy as expressed in the Golden
Globes Order and subsequent adjudications. The Court adheres to its normal
practice of declining to decide cases not before it. See, e.g., Sweatt v. Painter
(1950) (“Broader issues have been urged for our consideration, but we adhere to
the principle of deciding constitutional questions only in the context of the
particular case before the Court”).
Third, this opinion leaves the Commission free to modify its current indecency
policy in light of its determination of the public interest and applicable legal
requirements. And it leaves the courts free to review the current policy or any
modified policy in light of its content and application.

In my view, the Court's decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation (1978) was wrong

reconsideration. Cf. FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc. (2009) (Thomas, J.,

OPINION, IN WHICH BREYER, J., JOINED. SOUTER, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH
GINSBURG, J., JOINED.

JUSTICE SCALIA DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Section 2252A(a)(3)(B) of Title 18, United States Code, criminalizes, in certain
specified circumstances, the pandering or solicitation of child pornography.
This case presents the question whether that statute is overbroad under the
First Amendment or impermissibly vague under the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment.
I
A
We have long held that obscene speech--sexually explicit material that violates
fundamental notions of decency--is not protected by the First Amendment. See
Roth v. United States (1957). But to protect explicit material that has social
value, we have limited the scope of the obscenity exception, and have
overturned convictions for the distribution of sexually graphic but nonobscene
material. See Miller v. California (1973).
Over the last 25 years, we have confronted a related and overlapping category of
proscribable speech: child pornography. See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition
(2002); Osborne v. Ohio (1990); New York v. Ferber (1982). This consists of
sexually explicit visual portrayals that feature children. We have held that a
statute which proscribes the distribution of all child pornography, even material
that does not qualify as obscenity, does not on its face violate the First
Amendment. Moreover, we have held that the government may criminalize the
possession of child pornography, even though it may not criminalize the mere
possession of obscene material involving adults.
The broad authority to proscribe child pornography is not, however, unlimited.
Four Terms ago, we held facially overbroad two provisions of the federal Child
Pornography Protection Act of 1996 (CPPA). Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition.
The first of these banned the possession and distribution of "'any visual
depiction'" that "'is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit
conduct,'" even if it contained only youthful-looking adult actors or virtual
images of children generated by a computer. This was invalid, we explained,

Robson

836

The First Amendment

because the child-protection rationale for speech restriction does not apply to
materials produced without children. The second provision at issue in Free
Speech Coalition criminalized the possession and distribution of material that
had been pandered as child pornography, regardless of whether it actually was
that. A person could thus face prosecution for possessing unobjectionable
material that someone else had pandered. We held that this prohibition, which
did "more than prohibit pandering," was also facially overbroad. After our
decision in Free Speech Coalition, Congress went back to the drawing board and
produced legislation with the unlikely title of the Prosecutorial Remedies and
Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, 117 Stat.
650. We shall refer to it as the Act. Section 503 of the Act amended 18 U.S.C.
§2252A to add a new pandering and solicitation provision, relevant portions of
which now read as follows:
"(a) Any person who-"(3) knowingly-"(B) advertises, promotes, presents, distributes, or solicits through the mails, or
in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, any
material or purported material in a manner that reflects the belief, or that is
intended to cause another to believe, that the material or purported material is,
or contains-"(i) an obscene visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;
or
"(ii) a visual depiction of an actual minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,
"shall be punished as provided in subsection (b)."

Section 2256(2)(A) defines "sexually explicit conduct" as
"actual or simulated-"(i) sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or
oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex;
"(ii) bestiality;
"(iii) masturbation;
"(iv) sadistic or masochistic abuse; or
"(v) lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person."

Violation of §2252A(a)(3)(B) incurs a minimum
imprisonment and a maximum of 20 years.

sentence

of

5

years

The Act's express findings indicate that Congress was concerned that limiting
the child-pornography prohibition to material that could be proved to feature
actual children, as our decision in Free Speech Coalition required, would enable
many child pornographers to evade conviction. The emergence of new
technology and the repeated retransmission of picture files over the Internet
could make it nearly impossible to prove that a particular image was produced
using real children--even though "[t]here is no substantial evidence that any of
the child pornography images being trafficked today were made other than by
the abuse of real children," virtual imaging being prohibitively expensive.
B
The following facts appear in the opinion of the Eleventh Circuit. On April 26,
2004, respondent Michael Williams, using a sexually explicit screen name,
signed in to a public Internet chat room. A Secret Service agent had also signed

Robson

837

The First Amendment

in to the chat room under the moniker "Lisa n Miami." The agent noticed that
Williams had posted a message that read: "Dad of toddler has 'good' pics of her
an [sic] me for swap of your toddler pics, or live cam." The agent struck up a
conversation with Williams, leading to an electronic exchange of
nonpornographic pictures of children. (The agent's picture was in fact a
doctored photograph of an adult.) Soon thereafter, Williams messaged that he
had photographs of men molesting his 4-year-old daughter. Suspicious that
"Lisa n Miami" was a law-enforcement agent, before proceeding further Williams
demanded that the agent produce additional pictures. When he did not,
Williams posted the following public message in the chat room: "HERE ROOM; I
CAN PUT UPLINK CUZ IM FOR REAL--SHE CANT." Appended to this
declaration was a hyperlink that, when clicked, led to seven pictures of actual
children, aged approximately 5 to 15, engaging in sexually explicit conduct and
displaying their genitals. The Secret Service then obtained a search warrant for
Williams's home, where agents seized two hard drives containing at least 22
images of real children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, some of it
sadomasochistic.
Williams was charged with one count of pandering child pornography under
§2252A(a)(3)(B) and one count of possessing child pornography under
§2252A(a)(5)(B). He pleaded guilty to both counts but reserved the right to
challenge the constitutionality of the pandering conviction. The District Court
rejected his challenge, and sentenced him to concurrent 60-month sentences
on the two counts. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
reversed the pandering conviction, holding that the statute was both overbroad
and impermissibly vague.
We granted certiorari.
II
A
According to our First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, a statute is facially
invalid if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech. The doctrine
seeks to strike a balance between competing social costs. Virginia v. Hicks
(2003). On the one hand, the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law deters
people from engaging in constitutionally protected speech, inhibiting the free
exchange of ideas. On the other hand, invalidating a law that in some of its
applications is perfectly constitutional--particularly a law directed at conduct so
antisocial that it has been made criminal--has obvious harmful effects. In order
to maintain an appropriate balance, we have vigorously enforced the
requirement that a statute's overbreadth be substantial, not only in an absolute
sense, but also relative to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep. Invalidation for
overbreadth is "'"strong medicine"'" that is not to be "casually employed."
The first step in overbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute; it is
impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing
what the statute covers. Generally speaking, §2252A(a)(3)(B) prohibits offers to
provide and requests to obtain child pornography. The statute does not require
the actual existence of child pornography. In this respect, it differs from the
statutes in Ferber, Osborne, and Free Speech Coalition, which prohibited the
possession or distribution of child pornography. Rather than targeting the
underlying material, this statute bans the collateral speech that introduces

Robson

838

The First Amendment

such material into the child-pornography distribution network. Thus, an
Internet user who solicits child pornography from an undercover agent violates
the statute, even if the officer possesses no child pornography. Likewise, a
person who advertises virtual child pornography as depicting actual children
also falls within the reach of the statute.
The statute's definition of the material or purported material that may not be
pandered or solicited precisely tracks the material held constitutionally
proscribable in Ferber and Miller: obscene material depicting (actual or virtual)
children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and any other material depicting
actual children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
A number of features of the statute are important to our analysis:
First, the statute includes a scienter requirement. The first word of
§2252A(a)(3)--"knowingly"--applies to both of the immediately following
subdivisions, both the previously existing §2252A(a)(3)(A) and the new
§2252A(a)(3)(B) at issue here. We think that the best reading of the term in
context is that it applies to every element of the two provisions. This is not a
case where grammar or structure enables the challenged provision or some of
its parts to be read apart from the "knowingly" requirement. Here "knowingly"
introduces the challenged provision itself, making clear that it applies to that
provision in its entirety; and there is no grammatical barrier to reading it that
way.
Second, the statute's string of operative verbs--"advertises, promotes, presents,
distributes, or solicits"--is reasonably read to have a transactional connotation.
That is to say, the statute penalizes speech that accompanies or seeks to induce
a transfer of child pornography--via reproduction or physical delivery--from one
person to another. For three of the verbs, this is obvious: advertising,
distributing, and soliciting are steps taken in the course of an actual or
proposed transfer of a product, typically but not exclusively in a commercial
market. When taken in isolation, the two remaining verbs--"promotes" and
"presents"--are susceptible of multiple and wide-ranging meanings. In context,
however, those meanings are narrowed by the commonsense canon of noscitur a
sociis--which counsels that a word is given more precise content by the
neighboring words with which it is associated. "Promotes," in a list that
includes "solicits," "distributes," and "advertises," is most sensibly read to mean
the act of recommending purported child pornography to another person for his
acquisition. See American Heritage Dictionary 1403 (4th ed. 2000) (def. 4: "To
attempt to sell or popularize by advertising or publicity"). Similarly, "presents,"
in the context of the other verbs with which it is associated, means showing or
offering the child pornography to another person with a view to his acquisition.
(def. 3a: "To make a gift or award of"). (The envisioned acquisition, of course,
could be an electronic one, for example reproduction of the image on the
recipient's computer screen.)
To be clear, our conclusion that all the words in this list relate to transactions
is not to say that they relate to commercial transactions. One could certainly
"distribute" child pornography without expecting payment in return. Indeed, in
much Internet file sharing of child pornography each participant makes his files
available for free to other participants--as Williams did in this case.

Robson

839

The First Amendment

"Distribution may involve sophisticated pedophile rings or organized crime
groups that operate for profit, but in many cases, is carried out by individual
amateurs who seek no financial reward." Child Pornography on the Internet 9.
To run afoul of the statute, the speech need only accompany or seek to induce
the transfer of child pornography from one person to another.
Third, the phrase "in a manner that reflects the belief" includes both subjective
and objective components. "[A] manner that reflects the belief" is quite different
from "a manner that would give one cause to believe." The first formulation
suggests that the defendant must actually have held the subjective "belief" that
the material or purported material was child pornography. Thus, a
misdescription that leads the listener to believe the defendant is offering child
pornography, when the defendant in fact does not believe the material is child
pornography, does not violate this prong of the statute. (It may, however, violate
the "manner ... that is intended to cause another to believe" prong if the
misdescription is intentional.) There is also an objective component to the
phrase "manner that reflects the belief." The statement or action must
objectively manifest a belief that the material is child pornography; a mere belief,
without an accompanying statement or action that would lead a reasonable
person to understand that the defendant holds that belief, is insufficient.
Fourth, the other key phrase, "in a manner . . . that is intended to cause
another to believe," contains only a subjective element: The defendant must
"intend" that the listener believe the material to be child pornography, and must
select a manner of "advertising, promoting, presenting, distributing, or
soliciting" the material that he thinks will engender that belief--whether or not a
reasonable person would think the same. (Of course in the ordinary case the
proof of the defendant's intent will be the fact that, as an objective matter, the
manner of "advertising, promoting, presenting, distributing, or soliciting" plainly
sought to convey that the material was child pornography.)
Fifth, the definition of "sexually explicit conduct" (the visual depiction of which,
engaged in by an actual minor, is covered by the Act's pandering and soliciting
prohibition even when it is not obscene) is very similar to the definition of
"sexual conduct" in the New York statute we upheld against an overbreadth
challenge in Ferber. That defined "sexual conduct" as "'actual or simulated
sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation,
sado-masochistic abuse, or lewd exhibition of the genitals.'" Congress used
essentially the same constitutionally approved definition in the present Act. If
anything, the fact that the defined term here is "sexually explicit conduct,"
rather than (as in Ferber) merely "sexual conduct," renders the definition more
immune from facial constitutional attack. "[S]imulated sexual intercourse" (a
phrase found in the Ferber definition as well) is even less susceptible here of
application to the sorts of sex scenes found in R-rated movies--which suggest
that intercourse is taking place without explicitly depicting it, and without
causing viewers to believe that the actors are actually engaging in intercourse.
"Sexually explicit conduct" connotes actual depiction of the sex act rather than
merely the suggestion that it is occurring. And "simulated" sexual intercourse is
not sexual intercourse that is merely suggested, but rather sexual intercourse
that is explicitly portrayed, even though (through camera tricks or otherwise) it
may not actually have occurred. The portrayal must cause a reasonable viewer

Robson

840

The First Amendment

to believe that the actors actually engaged in that conduct on camera. Critically,
unlike in Free Speech Coalition, §2252A(a)(3)(B)(ii)'s requirement of a "visual
depiction of an actual minor" makes clear that, although the sexual intercourse
may be simulated, it must involve actual children (unless it is obscene). This
change eliminates any possibility that virtual child pornography or sex between
youthful-looking adult actors might be covered by the term "simulated sexual
intercourse."
B
We now turn to whether the statute, as we have construed it, criminalizes a
substantial amount of protected expressive activity.
Offers to engage in illegal transactions are categorically excluded from First
Amendment protection. Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human
Relations (1973); Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co. (1949). One would think
that this principle resolves the present case, since the statute criminalizes only
offers to provide or requests to obtain contraband--child obscenity and child
pornography involving actual children, both of which are proscribed, see 18
U.S.C. §1466A(a), §2252A(a)(5)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. V), and the proscription of
which is constitutional, see Free Speech Coalition. The Eleventh Circuit,
however, believed that the exclusion of First Amendment protection extended
only to commercial offers to provide or receive contraband: "Because [the
statute] is not limited to commercial speech but extends also to non-commercial
promotion, presentation, distribution, and solicitation, we must subject the
content-based restriction of the PROTECT Act pandering provision to strict
scrutiny ...."
This mistakes the rationale for the categorical exclusion. It is based not on the
less privileged First Amendment status of commercial speech, see Central
Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.Y. (1980), but on the
principle that offers to give or receive what it is unlawful to possess have no
social value and thus, like obscenity, enjoy no First Amendment protection.
Many long established criminal proscriptions--such as laws against conspiracy,
incitement, and solicitation--criminalize speech (commercial or not) that is
intended to induce or commence illegal activities. See, e.g., ALI, Model Penal
Code §5.02(1) (1985) (solicitation to commit a crime); §5.03(1)(a) (conspiracy to
commit a crime). Offers to provide or requests to obtain unlawful material,
whether as part of a commercial exchange or not, are similarly undeserving of
First Amendment protection. It would be an odd constitutional principle that
permitted the government to prohibit offers to sell illegal drugs, but not offers to
give them away for free.
To be sure, there remains an important distinction between a proposal to
engage in illegal activity and the abstract advocacy of illegality. See
Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) (per curiam). The Act before us does not prohibit
advocacy of child pornography, but only offers to provide or requests to obtain it.
There is no doubt that this prohibition falls well within constitutional bounds.
The constitutional defect we found in the pandering provision at issue in Free
Speech Coalition was that it went beyond pandering to prohibit possession of
material that could not otherwise be proscribed.

Robson

841

The First Amendment

In sum, we hold that offers to provide or requests to obtain child pornography
are categorically excluded from the First Amendment. Since the Eleventh
Circuit erroneously concluded otherwise, it applied strict scrutiny to
§2252A(a)(3)(B), lodging three fatal objections. We address these objections
because they could be recast as arguments that Congress has gone beyond the
categorical exception.
The Eleventh Circuit believed it a constitutional difficulty that no child
pornography need exist to trigger the statute. In its view, the fact that the
statute could punish a "braggart, exaggerator, or outright liar" rendered it
unconstitutional. That seems to us a strange constitutional calculus. Although
we have held that the government can ban both fraudulent offers and offers to
provide illegal products, the Eleventh Circuit would forbid the government from
punishing fraudulent offers to provide illegal products. We see no logic in that
position; if anything, such statements are doubly excluded from the First
Amendment.
*** [T]he Eleventh Circuit also thought that the statute could apply to someone
who subjectively believes that an innocuous picture of a child is "lascivious."
(Clause (v) of the definition of "sexually explicit conduct" is "lascivious
exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.") That is not so. The
defendant must believe that the picture contains certain material, and that
material in fact (and not merely in his estimation) must meet the statutory
definition. Where the material at issue is a harmless picture of a child in a
bathtub and the defendant, knowing that material, erroneously believes that it
constitutes a "lascivious display of the genitals," the statute has no application.
Williams and amici raise other objections, which demonstrate nothing so
forcefully as the tendency of our overbreadth doctrine to summon forth an
endless stream of fanciful hypotheticals. Williams argues, for example, that a
person who offers nonpornographic photographs of young girls to a pedophile
could be punished under the statute if the pedophile secretly expects that the
pictures will contain child pornography. That hypothetical does not implicate
the statute, because the offeror does not hold the belief or intend the recipient
to believe that the material is child pornography.
Amici contend that some advertisements for mainstream Hollywood movies that
depict underage characters having sex violate the statute. We think it
implausible that a reputable distributor of Hollywood movies, such as
Amazon.com, believes that one of these films contains actual children engaging
in actual or simulated sex on camera; and even more implausible that
Amazon.com would intend to make its customers believe such a thing. The
average person understands that sex scenes in mainstream movies use
nonchild actors, depict sexual activity in a way that would not rise to the
explicit level necessary under the statute, or, in most cases, both.
There was raised at oral argument the question whether turning child
pornography over to the police might not count as "present[ing]" the material.
An interpretation of "presents" that would include turning material over to the
authorities would of course be self-defeating in a statute that looks to the
prosecution of people who deal in child pornography. And it would effectively
nullify §2252A(d), which provides an affirmative defense to the possession ban if

Robson

842

The First Amendment

a defendant promptly delivers child pornography to a law-enforcement agency.
(The possession offense would simply be replaced by a pandering offense for
delivering the material to law-enforcement officers.) In any event, the verb
"present"--along with "distribute" and "advertise," as well as "give," "lend,"
"deliver," and "transfer"--was used in the definition of "promote" in Ferber.
Despite that inclusion, we had no difficulty concluding that the New York
statute survived facial challenge. ***
It was also suggested at oral argument that the statute might cover
documentary footage of atrocities being committed in foreign countries, such as
soldiers raping young children. Perhaps so, if the material rises to the high level
of explicitness that we have held is required. That sort of documentary footage
could of course be the subject of an as-applied challenge. The courts
presumably would weigh the educational interest in the dissemination of
information about the atrocities against the government's interest in preventing
the distribution of materials that constitute "a permanent record" of the
children's degradation whose dissemination increases "the harm to the child."
Assuming that the constitutional balance would have to be struck in favor of
the documentary, the existence of that exception would not establish that the
statute is substantially overbroad. The "mere fact that one can conceive of some
impermissible applications of a statute is not sufficient to render it susceptible
to an overbreadth challenge." Members of City Council of Los Angeles v.
Taxpayers for Vincent (1984). In the vast majority of its applications, this statute
raises no constitutional problems whatever.
Finally, the dissent accuses us of silently overruling our prior decisions in
Ferber and Free Speech Coalition. *** We fail to see what First Amendment
interest would be served by drawing a distinction between two defendants who
attempt to acquire contraband, one of whom happens to be mistaken about the
contraband nature of what he would acquire. Is Congress forbidden from
punishing those who attempt to acquire what they believe to be nationalsecurity documents, but which are actually fakes? To ask is to answer. There is
no First Amendment exception from the general principle of criminal law that a
person attempting to commit a crime need not be exonerated because he has a
mistaken view of the facts.
III
As an alternative ground for facial invalidation, the Eleventh Circuit held that
§2252A(a)(3)(B) is void for vagueness. Vagueness doctrine is an outgrowth not of
the First Amendment, but of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. A
conviction fails to comport with due process if the statute under which it is
obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is
prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously
discriminatory enforcement. ***
Child pornography harms and debases the most defenseless of our citizens.
Both the State and Federal Governments have sought to suppress it for many
years, only to find it proliferating through the new medium of the Internet. This
Court held unconstitutional Congress's previous attempt to meet this new
threat, and Congress responded with a carefully crafted attempt to eliminate
the First Amendment problems we identified. As far as the provision at issue in
this case is concerned, that effort was successful.

Robson

843

The First Amendment

The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit is reversed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE STEVENS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE BREYER JOINS, CONCURRING.
My conclusion that this statutory provision is not facially unconstitutional is
buttressed by two interrelated considerations on which Justice Scalia finds it
unnecessary to rely. First, I believe the result to be compelled by the principle
that "every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a
statute from unconstitutionality."
Second, to the extent the statutory text alone is unclear, our duty to avoid
constitutional objections makes it especially appropriate to look beyond the text
in order to ascertain the intent of its drafters. It is abundantly clear from the
provision's legislative history that Congress' aim was to target materials
advertised, promoted, presented, distributed, or solicited with a lascivious
purpose--that is, with the intention of inciting sexual arousal. ***
JUSTICE SOUTER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE GINSBURG JOINS, DISSENTING.
Dealing in obscenity is penalized without violating the First Amendment, but as
a general matter pornography lacks the harm to justify prohibiting it. If,
however, a photograph (to take the kind of image in this case) shows an actual
minor child as a pornographic subject, its transfer and even its possession may
be made criminal. New York v. Ferber (1982); Osborne v. Ohio (1990). The
exception to the general rule rests not on the content of the picture but on the
need to foil the exploitation of child subjects, and the justification limits the
exception: only pornographic photographs of actual children may be prohibited,
Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002). Thus, just six years ago the Court
struck down a statute outlawing particular material merely represented to be
child pornography, but not necessarily depicting actual children.
The Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children
Today Act of 2003 (Act), 117 Stat. 650, was enacted in the wake of Free Speech
Coalition. The Act responds by avoiding any direct prohibition of transactions in
child pornography when no actual minors may be pictured; instead, it prohibits
proposals for transactions in pornography when a defendant manifestly believes
or would induce belief in a prospective party that the subject of an exchange or
exhibition is or will be an actual child, not an impersonated, simulated or
"virtual" one, or the subject of a composite created from lawful photos spliced
together. The Act specifically prohibits three types of those proposals. It outlaws
solicitation of child pornography, as well as two distinct kinds of offers: those
"advertis[ing]" or "promot[ing]" prosecutable child pornography, which
recommend the material with the implication that the speaker can make it
available, and those "present[ing]" or "distribut[ing]" such child pornography,
which make the material available to anyone who chooses to take it.
The Court holds it is constitutional to prohibit these proposals, and up to a
point I do not disagree. In particular, I accept the Court's explanation that
Congress may criminalize proposals unrelated to any extant image. I part ways

Robson

844

The First Amendment

from the Court, however, on the regulation of proposals made with regard to
specific, existing representations. Under the new law, the elements of the
pandering offense are the same, whether or not the images are of real children.
As to those that do not show real children, of course, a transaction in the
material could not be prosecuted consistently with the First Amendment, and I
believe that maintaining the First Amendment protection of expression we have
previously held to cover fake child pornography requires a limit to the law's
criminalization of pandering proposals. In failing to confront the tension
between ostensibly protecting the material pandered while approving
prosecution of the pandering of that same material, and in allowing the new
pandering prohibition to suppress otherwise protected speech, the Court
undermines Ferber and Free Speech Coalition in both reasoning and result. This
is the significant element of today's holding, and I respectfully dissent from it.
I
[omitted]
II
What justification can there be for making independent crimes of proposals to
engage in transactions that may include protected materials? The Court gives
three answers, none of which comes to grips with the difficulty raised by the
question. The first says it is simply wrong to say that the Act makes it criminal
to propose a lawful transaction, since an element of the forbidden proposal
must express a belief or inducement to believe that the subject of the proposed
transaction shows actual children. But this does not go to the point. The
objection is not that the Act criminalizes a proposal for a transaction described
as being in virtual (that is, protected) child pornography. The point is that some
proposals made criminal, because they express a belief that they refer to real
child pornography, will relate to extant material that does not, or cannot be,
demonstrated to show real children and so may not be prohibited. When a
proposal covers existing photographs, the Act does not require that the
requisite belief (manifested or encouraged) in the reality of the subjects be a
correct belief. Prohibited proposals may relate to transactions in lawful, as well
as unlawful, pornography.
Much the same may be said about the Court's second answer, that a proposal
to commit a crime enjoys no speech protection. For the reason just given, that
answer does not face up to the source of the difficulty: the action actually
contemplated in the proposal, the transfer of the particular image, is not
criminal if it turns out that an actual child is not shown in the photograph. If
Ferber and Free Speech Coalition are good law, the facts sufficient for conviction
under the Act do not suffice to show that the image (perhaps merely simulated),
and thus a transfer of that image, are outside the bounds of constitutional
protection. For this reason, it is not enough just to say that the First
Amendment does not protect proposals to commit crimes. For that rule rests on
the assumption that the proposal is actually to commit a crime, not to do an act
that may turn out to be no crime at all. Why should the general rule of
unprotected criminal proposals cover a case like the proposal to transfer what
may turn out to be fake child pornography?
The Court's third answer analogizes the proposal to an attempt to commit a
crime, and relies on the rule of criminal law that an attempt is criminal even

Robson

845

The First Amendment

when some impediment makes it impossible to complete the criminal act (the
possible impediment here being the advanced age, say, or simulated character
of the child-figure). Although the actual transfer the speaker has in mind may
not turn out to be criminal, the argument goes, the transfer intended by the
speaker is criminal, because the speaker believes that the contemplated
transfer will be of real child pornography, and transfer of real child pornography
is criminal. The fact that the circumstances are not as he believes them to be,
because the material does not depict actual minors, is no defense to his attempt
to engage in an unlawful transaction.
But invoking attempt doctrine to dispense with Free Speech Coalition's realchild requirement in the circumstances of this case is incoherent with the Act,
and it fails to fit the paradigm of factual impossibility or qualify for an extended
version of that rule. *** Treating pandering itself as a species of attempt would
thus mean that there is a statutory, inchoate offense of attempting to attempt to
commit a substantive child pornography crime. A metaphysician could imagine
a system like this, but the universe of inchoate crimes is not expandable
indefinitely under the actual principles of criminal law, let alone when First
Amendment protection is threatened.
*** Where Government documents, blank cartridges, and baking powder are
involved, deterrence can be promoted without compromising any other
important policy, which is not true of criminalizing mistaken child pornography
proposals. There are three dispositive differences. As for the first, if the law can
criminalize proposals for transactions in fake as well as true child pornography
as if they were like attempts to sell cocaine that turned out to be baking powder,
constitutional law will lose something sufficiently important to have made it
into multiple holdings of this Court, and that is the line between child
pornography that may be suppressed and fake child pornography that falls
within First Amendment protection. No one can seriously assume that after
today's decision the Government will go on prosecuting defendants for selling
child pornography (requiring a showing that a real child is pictured, under Free
Speech Coalition); it will prosecute for merely proposing a pornography
transaction manifesting or inducing the belief that a photo is real child
pornography, free of any need to demonstrate that any extant underlying photo
does show a real child. If the Act can be enforced, it will function just as it was
meant to do, by merging the whole subject of child pornography into the offense
of proposing a transaction, dispensing with the real-child element in the
underlying subject. And eliminating the need to prove a real child will be a loss
of some consequence. This is so not because there will possibly be less
pornography available owing to the greater ease of prosecuting, but simply
because there must be a line between what the Government may suppress and
what it may not, and a segment of that line will be gone. This Court went to
great pains to draw it in Ferber and Free Speech Coalition; it was worth drawing
and it is worth respecting now in facing the attempt to end-run that line
through the provisions of the Act.
The second reason for treating child pornography differently follows from the
first. If the deluded drug dealer is held liable for an attempt crime there is no
risk of eliminating baking powder from trade in lawful commodities. Likewise, if
the mistaken spy is convicted of attempting to disclose classified national

Robson

846

The First Amendment

security documents there will be no worry that lawful speech will be suppressed
as a consequence; any unclassified documents in question can be quoted in the
newspaper, other unclassified documents will circulate, and analysts of politics
and foreign policy will be able to rely on them. But if the Act can effectively
eliminate the real-child requirement when a proposal relates to extant material,
a class of protected speech will disappear. True, what will be lost is short on
merit, but intrinsic value is not the reason for protecting unpopular expression.
Finally, if the Act stands when applied to identifiable, extant pornographic
photographs, then in practical terms Ferber and Free Speech Coalition fall. They
are left as empty as if the Court overruled them formally, and when a case as
well considered and as recently decided as Free Speech Coalition is put aside
(after a mere six years) there ought to be a very good reason. Another pair of
First Amendment cases come to mind, compare Minersville School Dist. v.
Gobitis (1940), with West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943). In Barnette, the
Court set out the reason for its abrupt turn in overruling Gobitis after three
years, but here nothing is explained. Attempts with baking powder and
unclassified documents can be punished without damage to confidence in
precedent; suppressing protected pornography cannot be.
These differences should be dispositive. Eliminating the line between protected
and unprotected speech, guaranteeing the suppression of a category of
expression previously protected, and reducing recent and carefully considered
First Amendment precedents to empty shells are heavy prices, not to be paid
without a substantial offset, which is missing from this case. Hence, my answer
that there is no justification for saving the Act's attempt to get around our
holdings. We should hold that a transaction in what turns out to be fake
pornography is better understood, not as an incomplete attempt to commit a
crime, but as a completed series of intended acts that simply do not add up to a
crime, owing to the privileged character of the material the parties were in fact
about to deal in.
The upshot is that there ought to be no absolute rule on the relationship
between attempt liability and a frustrating mistake. Not all attempts frustrated
by mistake should be punishable, and not all mistaken assumptions that
expressive material is unprotected should bar liability for attempts to commit a
crime. The legitimacy of attempt liability should turn on its consequences for
protected expression and the law that protects it. When, as here, a protected
category of expression would inevitably be suppressed and its First Amendment
safeguard left pointless, the Government has the burden to justify this damage
to free speech.
III
Untethering the power to suppress proposals about extant pornography from
any assessment of the likely effects the proposals might have has an unsettling
significance well beyond the subject of child pornography. For the Court is
going against the grain of pervasive First Amendment doctrine that tolerates
speech restriction not on mere general tendencies of expression, or the private
understandings of speakers or listeners, but only after a critical assessment of
practical consequences. Thus, one of the milestones of American political liberty
is Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) (per curiam), which is seen as the culmination of
a half century's development that began with Justice Holmes's dissent in

Robson

847

The First Amendment

Abrams v. United States (1919). In place of the rule that dominated the First
World War sedition and espionage cases, allowing suppression of speech for its
tendency and the intent behind it, see Schenck v. United States (1919),
Brandenburg insisted that
"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a
State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except
where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless
action and is likely to incite or produce such action."

Brandenburg unmistakably insists that any limit on speech be grounded in a
realistic, factual assessment of harm. This is a far cry from the Act before us
now, which rests criminal prosecution for proposing transactions in expressive
material on nothing more than a speaker's statement about the material itself,
a statement that may disclose no more than his own belief about the subjects
represented or his desire to foster belief in another. This should weigh heavily
in the overbreadth balance, because "First Amendment freedoms are most in
danger when the government seeks to control thought or to justify its laws for
that impermissible end. The right to think is the beginning of freedom, and
speech must be protected from the government because speech is the beginning
of thought." Free Speech Coalition. See also Hurley v. Irish-American Gay,
Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc. (1995) ("The very idea that a
noncommercial speech restriction be used to produce thoughts and statements
acceptable to some groups or, indeed, all people, grates on the First
Amendment, for it amounts to nothing less than a proposal to limit speech in
the service of orthodox expression. The Speech Clause has no more certain
antithesis").
IV
I said that I would not pay the price enacted by the Act without a substantial
justification, which I am at a loss to find here. I have to assume that the Court
sees some grounding for the Act that I do not, however, and I suppose the
holding can only be explained as an uncritical acceptance of a claim made both
to Congress and to this Court. In each forum the Government argued that a
jury's appreciation of the mere possibility of simulated or virtual child
pornography will prevent convictions for the real thing, by inevitably raising
reasonable doubt about whether actual children are shown. The Government
voices the fear that skeptical jurors will place traffic in child pornography
beyond effective prosecution unless it can find some way to avoid the Ferber
limitation, skirt Free Speech Coalition, and allow prosecution whether
pornography shows actual children or not.
The claim needs to be taken with a grain of salt. There has never been a time
when some such concern could not be raised. Long before the Act was passed,
for example, pornographic photos could be taken of models one day into
adulthood, and yet there is no indication that prosecution has ever been
crippled by the need to prove young-looking models were underage.
Still, if I were convinced there was a real reason for the Government's fear
stemming from computer simulation, I would be willing to reexamine Ferber.
Conditions can change, and if today's technology left no other effective way to
stop professional and amateur pornographers from exploiting children there

Robson

848

The First Amendment

would be a fair claim that some degree of expressive protection had to yield to
protect the children.
But the Government does not get a free pass whenever it claims a worthy
objective for curtailing speech, and I have further doubts about the need
claimed here. Although Congress found that child pornography defendants
"almost universally rais[e]" the defense that the alleged child pornography could
be simulated or virtual, neither Congress nor this Court has been given the
citation to a single case in which a defendant's acquittal is reasonably
attributable to that defense. See Brief for Free Speech Coalition etal. as Amici
Curiae 21-23; Brief for National Law Center for Children and Families et al. as
Amici Curiae 10-13. The Government thus seems to be selling itself short; it
appears to be highly successful in convicting child pornographers, the
overwhelming majority of whom plead guilty rather than try their luck before a
jury with a virtual-child defense. And little seems to have changed since the
time of Free Speech Coalition, when the Court rejected an assertion of the same
interest. ("[T]he Government says that the possibility of producing images by
using computer imaging makes it very difficult for it to prosecute those who
produce pornography by using real children.... The necessary solution, the
argument runs, is to prohibit both kinds of images. The argument, in essence,
is that protected speech may be banned as a means to ban unprotected speech.
This analysis turns the First Amendment upside down"); (Thomas, J.,
concurring in judgment) ("At this time ... the Government asserts only that
defendants raise such defenses, not that they have done so successfully. In fact,
the Government points to no case in which a defendant has been acquitted
based on a 'computer-generated images' defense").
Without some convincing evidence to the contrary, experience tells us to have
faith in the capacity of the jury system, which I would have expected to operate
in much the following way, if the Act were not on the books. If the Government
sought to prosecute proposals about extant images as attempts, it would seek
to carry its burden of showing that real children were depicted in the image
subject to the proposal simply by introducing the image into evidence; if the
figures in the picture looked like real children, the Government would have
made its prima facie demonstration on that element. The defense might well
offer expert testimony to the effect that technology can produce convincing
simulations, but if this was the extent of the testimony that came in, the crossexamination would ask whether the witness could say that this particular,
seemingly authentic representation was merely simulated. If the witness could
say that (or said so on direct), and survived further questioning about the basis
for the opinion and its truth, acquittal would have been proper; the defendant
would have raised reasonable doubt about whether a child had been victimized
(the same standard that would govern if the defendant were on trial for abusing
a child personally). But if the defense had no specific evidence that the
particular image failed to show actual children, I am skeptical that a jury would
have been likely to entertain reasonable doubt that the image showed a real
child.
Perhaps I am wrong, but without some demonstration that juries have been
rendering exploitation of children unpunishable, there is no excuse for cutting
back on the First Amendment and no alternative to finding overbreadth in this

Act. I would hold it unconstitutional on the authority of Ferber and Free Speech
Coalition.

Note:	  Funding	  
The protection of children and the standards of decency unmoored from
obscenity doctrine often implicate the “unconstitutional conditions”
doctrine discussed in Chapter 6.
For example, The Children’s Internet Protection Act, CIPA, passed by
Congress in 2000, attached a condition to the receipt of government
discounts or grants to libraries and schools supporting computer use.
The condition was the installation of software on all computers to prevent
minors from accessing harmful material. Such filters would mean, for
example, that a library patron could not freely access information
regarding Janet Jackson’s wardrobe malfunction. This would be true
because a search for “Super Bowl XXXVIII” would be blocked: XXX would
be a filtered term. Similarly, a search for “breast,” even if accompanied
with “cancer” or “chicken,” would be blocked. Arguably, an adult library
patron could consult with a librarian and have the software disabled.
The American Library Association challenged CIPA based on the
forfeiture of First Amendment rights as an unconstitutional condition. In
its decision in United States v. American Library Association (2003), a
majority of the Court upheld CIPA, with Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and
Souter dissenting. Justice Rehnquist, writing for the plurality phrased
the holding thusly:
CIPA does not “penalize” libraries that choose not to install such software, or
deny them the right to provide their patrons with unfiltered Internet access.
Rather, CIPA simply reflects Congress’ decision not to subsidize their doing so.
To the extent that libraries wish to offer unfiltered access, they are free to do so
without federal assistance.

Whether or not a library could continue to exist or to finance computer
access for its patrons without these federal subsidies was not a relevant
inquiry.
The Court in American Library Association relied upon its 1998 decision
in National Endowment for Arts v. Finley. Karen Finley, one of the six
plaintiffs, was an artist whose performance piece of her nude but
chocolate-covered body became notorious. Finley had been recommended
for a National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grant, but was vetoed at the
highest levels. Congress had recently mandated the NEA to ensure not
only that artistic excellence and merit were criteria, but also to take into
consideration “general standards of decency and respect for the diverse
beliefs and values of the American public.” This change was motivated by

Robson

Congressional disapproval of the previous use of NEA money by a
museum funding a retrospective of the photography of Robert
Mapplethorpe, which included nudity and homoerotism, and by a
different arts organization that had funded the work of Andres Serrano,
maker of the controversial Piss Christ.
In considering Finley’s First Amendment challenge that the decency
provision was unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, the Court
stressed that Congress did not compel any particular action by the NEA,
but only required the NEA to “take into consideration” general standards
of decency in making its funding decisions.
Moreover, decency could mean different things to different people; the
Court contrasted “a septegenarian in Tuscaloosa and a teenager in Las
Vegas.” The vagueness of “decency” worked in favor of it not being a
preclusion of a particular viewpoint, even as the Court rejected the
argument that “decency” was unconstitutionally vague. The status of
the government as funder was pivotal: “when the Government is acting
as patron rather than as sovereign, the consequences of imprecision are
not constitutionally severe.”

ROBERTS, C. J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH STEVENS, SCALIA, KENNEDY,
THOMAS, GINSBURG, BREYER, AND SOTOMAYOR, JJ., JOINED. ALITO, J., FILED A DISSENTING
OPINION.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Congress enacted 18 U. S. C. §48 to criminalize the commercial creation, sale,
or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty. The statute does not
address underlying acts harmful to animals, but only portrayals of such
conduct. The question presented is whether the prohibition in the statute is
consistent with the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.
I
Section 48 establishes a criminal penalty of up to five years in prison for anyone
who knowingly “creates, sells, or possesses a depiction of animal cruelty,” if
done “for commercial gain” in interstate or foreign commerce. §48(a).[Footnote
1] A depiction of “animal cruelty” is defined as one “in which a living animal is
intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed,” if that conduct
violates federal or state law where “the creation, sale, or possession takes
place.” §48(c)(1). In what is referred to as the “exceptions clause,” the law

Robson

851

The First Amendment

exempts from prohibition any depiction “that has serious religious, political,
scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.” §48(b).
The legislative background of §48 focused primarily on the interstate market for
“crush videos.” According to the House Committee Report on the bill, such
videos feature the intentional torture and killing of helpless animals, including
cats, dogs, monkeys, mice, and hamsters. H. R. Rep. No. 106–397, p. 2 (1999)
(hereinafter H. R. Rep.). Crush videos often depict women slowly crushing
animals to death “with their bare feet or while wearing high heeled shoes,”
sometimes while “talking to the animals in a kind of dominatrix patter” over
“[t]he cries and squeals of the animals, obviously in great pain.” Ibid. Apparently
these depictions “appeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish who find
them sexually arousing or otherwise exciting.” The acts depicted in crush videos
are typically prohibited by the animal cruelty laws enacted by all 50 States and
the District of Columbia. See Brief for United States 25, n. 7 (listing statutes).
But crush videos rarely disclose the participants’ identities, inhibiting
prosecution of the underlying conduct. See H. R. Rep., at 3; accord, Brief for
State of Florida et al. as Amici Curiae 11.
This case, however, involves an application of §48 to depictions of animal
fighting. Dogfighting, for example, is unlawful in all 50 States and the District of
Columbia, see Brief for United States 26, n. 8 (listing statutes), and has been
restricted by federal law since 1976. Animal Welfare Act Amendments of 1976.
Respondent Robert J. Stevens ran a business, “Dogs of Velvet and Steel,” and
an associated Web site, through which he sold videos of pit bulls engaging in
dogfights and attacking other animals. Among these videos were Japan Pit
Fights and Pick-A-Winna: A Pit Bull Documentary, which include contemporary
footage of dogfights in Japan (where such conduct is allegedly legal) as well as
footage of American dogfights from the 1960’s and 1970’s. A third video, Catch
Dogs and Country Living, depicts the use of pit bulls to hunt wild boar, as well
as a “gruesome” scene of a pit bull attacking a domestic farm pig. On the basis
of these videos, Stevens was indicted on three counts of violating §48.
Stevens moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that §48 is facially invalid
under the First Amendment. The District Court denied the motion. It held that
the depictions subject to §48, like obscenity or child pornography, are
categorically unprotected by the First Amendment. It went on to hold that §48
is not substantially overbroad, because the exceptions clause sufficiently
narrows the statute to constitutional applications. The jury convicted Stevens
on all counts, and the District Court sentenced him to three concurrent
sentences of 37 months’ imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised
release.
The en banc Third Circuit, over a three-judge dissent, declared §48 facially
unconstitutional and vacated Stevens’s conviction. The Court of Appeals first
held that §48 regulates speech that is protected by the First Amendment. The
Court declined to recognize a new category of unprotected speech for depictions
of animal cruelty, and rejected the Government’s analogy between animal
cruelty depictions and child pornography.
The Court of Appeals then held that §48 could not survive strict scrutiny as a
content-based regulation of protected speech. It found that the statute lacked a

Robson

852

The First Amendment

compelling government interest and was neither narrowly tailored to preventing
animal cruelty nor the least restrictive means of doing so. It therefore held §48
facially invalid.
In an extended footnote, the Third Circuit noted that §48 “might also be
unconstitutionally overbroad,” because it “potentially covers a great deal of
constitutionally protected speech” and “sweeps [too] widely” to be limited only
by prosecutorial discretion. But the Court of Appeals declined to rest its
analysis on this ground.
We granted certiorari.
II
The Government’s primary submission is that §48 necessarily complies with the
Constitution because the banned depictions of animal cruelty, as a class, are
categorically unprotected by the First Amendment. We disagree.
The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law … abridging
the freedom of speech.” “[A]s a general matter, the First Amendment means that
government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its
ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties
Union (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 48 explicitly regulates
expression based on content: The statute restricts “visual [and] auditory
depiction[s],” such as photographs, videos, or sound recordings, depending on
whether they depict conduct in which a living animal is intentionally harmed.
As such, §48 is “ ‘presumptively invalid,’ and the Government bears the burden
to rebut that presumption.” United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,
(2000) (quoting R. A. V. v. St. Paul (1992)).
“From 1791 to the present,” however, the First Amendment has “permitted
restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,” and has never
“include[d] a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.” These “historic
and traditional categories long familiar to the bar,”—including obscenity, Roth v.
United States (1957), defamation, Beauharnais v. Illinois (1952), fraud, Virginia
Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. (1976), incitement,
Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) (per curiam), and speech integral to criminal
conduct, Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co. (1949)—are “well-defined and
narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which
have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem.” Chaplinsky v.
New Hampshire (1942).
The Government argues that “depictions of animal cruelty” should be added to
the list. It contends that depictions of “illegal acts of animal cruelty” that are
“made, sold, or possessed for commercial gain” necessarily “lack expressive
value,” and may accordingly “be regulated as unprotected speech.” Brief for
United States 10 (emphasis added). The claim is not just that Congress may
regulate depictions of animal cruelty subject to the First Amendment, but that
these depictions are outside the reach of that Amendment altogether—that they
fall into a “ ‘First Amendment Free Zone.’ ” Board of Airport Comm’rs of Los
Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc. (1987).
As the Government notes, the prohibition of animal cruelty itself has a long
history in American law, starting with the early settlement of the Colonies. see,

Robson

853

The First Amendment

e.g., The Body of Liberties §92 (Mass. Bay Colony 1641), reprinted in American
Historical Documents 1000–1904, 43 Harvard Classics 66, 79 (C. Eliot ed.
1910) (“No man shall exercise any Tirranny or Crueltie towards any bruite
Creature which are usuallie kept for man’s use”). But we are unaware of any
similar tradition excluding depictions of animal cruelty from “the freedom of
speech” codified in the First Amendment, and the Government points us to
none.
The Government contends that “historical evidence” about the reach of the First
Amendment is not “a necessary prerequisite for regulation today,” and that
categories of speech may be exempted from the First Amendment’s protection
without any long-settled tradition of subjecting that speech to regulation.
Instead, the Government points to Congress’s “ ‘legislative judgment that …
depictions of animals being intentionally tortured and killed [are] of such
minimal redeeming value as to render [them] unworthy of First Amendment
protection,’ ” and asks the Court to uphold the ban on the same basis. The
Government thus proposes that a claim of categorical exclusion should be
considered under a simple balancing test: “Whether a given category of speech
enjoys First Amendment protection depends upon a categorical balancing of the
value of the speech against its societal costs.”
As a free-floating test for First Amendment coverage, that sentence is startling
and dangerous. The First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech does not
extend only to categories of speech that survive an ad hoc balancing of relative
social costs and benefits. The First Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the
American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government
outweigh the costs. Our Constitution forecloses any attempt to revise that
judgment simply on the basis that some speech is not worth it. The
Constitution is not a document “prescribing limits, and declaring that those
limits may be passed at pleasure.” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 178
(1803).
To be fair to the Government, its view did not emerge from a vacuum. As the
Government correctly notes, this Court has often described historically
unprotected categories of speech as being “ ‘of such slight social value as a step
to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.’ ” R. A. V. (quoting Chaplinsky). In
New York v. Ferber (1982), we noted that within these categories of unprotected
speech, “the evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive
interests, if any, at stake, that no process of case-by-case adjudication is
required,” because “the balance of competing interests is clearly struck.” The
Government derives its proposed test from these descriptions in our precedents.
But such descriptions are just that—descriptive. They do not set forth a test
that may be applied as a general matter to permit the Government to imprison
any speaker so long as his speech is deemed valueless or unnecessary, or so
long as an ad hoc calculus of costs and benefits tilts in a statute’s favor.

protecting children from abuse, and that the value of using children in these
works (as opposed to simulated conduct or adult actors) was de minimis. But
our decision did not rest on this “balance of competing interests” alone. We
made clear that Ferber presented a special case: The market for child
pornography was “intrinsically related” to the underlying abuse, and was
therefore “an integral part of the production of such materials, an activity illegal
throughout the Nation.” As we noted, “ ‘[i]t rarely has been suggested that the
constitutional freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to speech or
writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal
statute.’ ” Ferber thus grounded its analysis in a previously recognized, longestablished category of unprotected speech, and our subsequent decisions have
shared this understanding.
Our decisions in Ferber and other cases cannot be taken as establishing a
freewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of
the First Amendment. Maybe there are some categories of speech that have
been historically unprotected, but have not yet been specifically identified or
discussed as such in our case law. But if so, there is no evidence that
“depictions of animal cruelty” is among them. We need not foreclose the future
recognition of such additional categories to reject the Government’s highly
manipulable balancing test as a means of identifying them.
III
Because we decline to carve out from the First Amendment any novel exception
for §48, we review Stevens’s First Amendment challenge under our existing
doctrine.
A
Stevens challenged §48 on its face, arguing that any conviction secured under
the statute would be unconstitutional. The court below decided the case on that
basis, and we granted the Solicitor General’s petition for certiorari to determine
“whether 18 U. S. C. 48 is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the
First Amendment.”
To succeed in a typical facial attack, Stevens would have to establish “that no
set of circumstances exists under which [§48] would be valid,” United States v.
Salerno (1987), or that the statute lacks any “plainly legitimate sweep,”
Washington v. Glucksberg (1997) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgments). Which
standard applies in a typical case is a matter of dispute that we need not and
do not address, and neither Salerno nor Glucksberg is a speech case. Here the
Government asserts that Stevens cannot prevail because §48 is plainly
legitimate as applied to crush videos and animal fighting depictions. Deciding
this case through a traditional facial analysis would require us to resolve
whether these applications of §48 are in fact consistent with the Constitution.
In the First Amendment context, however, this Court recognizes “a second type
of facial challenge,” whereby a law may be invalidated as overbroad if “a
substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation
to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.” Washington State Grange v.
Washington State Republican Party (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Stevens argues that §48 applies to common depictions of ordinary and lawful
activities, and that these depictions constitute the vast majority of materials
subject to the statute. The Government makes no effort to defend such a broad

Robson

855

The First Amendment

ban as constitutional. Instead, the Government’s entire defense of §48 rests on
interpreting the statute as narrowly limited to specific types of “extreme”
material. Brief for United States 8. As the parties have presented the issue,
therefore, the constitutionality of §48 hinges on how broadly it is construed. It
is to that question that we now turn.
B
As we explained two Terms ago, “[t]he first step in overbreadth analysis is to
construe the challenged statute; it is impossible to determine whether a statute
reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.” United States v.
Williams (2008). Because §48 is a federal statute, there is no need to defer to a
state court’s authority to interpret its own law.
We read §48 to create a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth. To begin with,
the text of the statute’s ban on a “depiction of animal cruelty” nowhere requires
that the depicted conduct be cruel. That text applies to “any … depiction” in
which “a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded,
or killed.” §48(c)(1). “[M]aimed, mutilated, [and] tortured” convey cruelty, but
“wounded” or “killed” do not suggest any such limitation.
The Government contends that the terms in the definition should be read to
require the additional element of “accompanying acts of cruelty.” The
Government bases this argument on the definiendum, “depiction of animal
cruelty,” and on “ ‘the commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis.’ ” As that canon
recognizes, an ambiguous term may be “given more precise content by the
neighboring words with which it is associated.” Likewise, an unclear definitional
phrase may take meaning from the term to be defined.
But the phrase “wounded … or killed” at issue here contains little ambiguity.
The Government’s opening brief properly applies the ordinary meaning of these
words, stating for example that to “ ‘kill’ is ‘to deprive of life.’ ” We agree that
“wounded” and “killed” should be read according to their ordinary meaning.
Nothing about that meaning requires cruelty.
While not requiring cruelty, §48 does require that the depicted conduct be
“illegal.” But this requirement does not limit §48 along the lines the
Government suggests. There are myriad federal and state laws concerning the
proper treatment of animals, but many of them are not designed to guard
against animal cruelty. Protections of endangered species, for example, restrict
even the humane “wound[ing] or kill[ing]” of “living animal[s].” §48(c)(1).
Livestock regulations are often designed to protect the health of human beings,
and hunting and fishing rules (seasons, licensure, bag limits, weight
requirements) can be designed to raise revenue, preserve animal populations, or
prevent accidents. The text of §48(c) draws no distinction based on the reason
the intentional killing of an animal is made illegal, and includes, for example,
the humane slaughter of a stolen cow.
What is more, the application of §48 to depictions of illegal conduct extends to
conduct that is illegal in only a single jurisdiction. Under subsection (c)(1), the
depicted conduct need only be illegal in “the State in which the creation, sale,
or possession takes place, regardless of whether the … wounding … or killing
took place in [that] State.” A depiction of entirely lawful conduct runs afoul of
the ban if that depiction later finds its way into another State where the same

Robson

856

The First Amendment

conduct is unlawful. This provision greatly expands the scope of §48, because
although there may be “a broad societal consensus” against cruelty to animals,
there is substantial disagreement on what types of conduct are properly
regarded as cruel. Both views about cruelty to animals and regulations having
no connection to cruelty vary widely from place to place.
In the District of Columbia, for example, all hunting is unlawful. D. C. Munic.
Regs., tit. 19, §1560 (2009). Other jurisdictions permit or encourage hunting,
and there is an enormous national market for hunting-related depictions in
which a living animal is intentionally killed. Hunting periodicals have
circulations in the hundreds of thousands or millions, see Mediaweek, Sept. 29,
2008, p. 28, and hunting television programs, videos, and Web sites are equally
popular, see Brief for Professional Outdoor Media Association et al. as Amici
Curiae 9–10. The demand for hunting depictions exceeds the estimated demand
for crush videos or animal fighting depictions by several orders of magnitude.
Compare Brief for National Rifle Association of America, Inc., as Amicus Curiae
12 (hereinafter NRA Brief) (estimating that hunting magazines alone account for
$135 million in annual retail sales) with Brief for United States 43–44, 46
(suggesting $1 million in crush video sales per year, and noting that Stevens
earned $57,000 from his videos). Nonetheless, because the statute allows each
jurisdiction to export its laws to the rest of the country, §48(a) extends to any
magazine or video depicting lawful hunting, so long as that depiction is sold
within the Nation’s Capital.
Those seeking to comply with the law thus face a bewildering maze of
regulations from at least 56 separate jurisdictions. Some States permit hunting
with crossbows, Ga. Code Ann. §27–3–4(1) (2007); Va. Code Ann. §29.1–
519(A)(6) (Lexis 2008 Cum. Supp.), while others forbid it, Ore. Admin. Reg. 635–
065–0725 (2009), or restrict it only to the disabled, N. Y. Envir. Conserv. Law
Ann. §11–0901(16) (West 2005). Missouri allows the “canned” hunting of
ungulates held in captivity, Mo. Code Regs. Ann., tit. 3, 10–9.560(1), but
Montana restricts such hunting to certain bird species, Mont. Admin. Rule
12.6.1202(1) (2007). The sharp-tailed grouse may be hunted in Idaho, but not
in Washington. Compare Idaho Admin. Code §13.01.09.606 (2009) with Wash.
Admin. Code §232–28–342 (2009).
The disagreements among the States—and the “commonwealth[s], territor[ies],
or possession[s] of the United States,” 18 U. S. C. §48(c)(2)—extend well beyond
hunting. State agricultural regulations permit different methods of livestock
slaughter in different places or as applied to different animals. Compare, e.g.,
Fla. Stat. §828.23(5) (2007) (excluding poultry from humane slaughter
requirements) with Cal. Food & Agric. Code Ann. §19501(b) (West 2001)
(including some poultry). California has recently banned cutting or “docking”
the tails of dairy cattle, which other States permit. 2009 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch.
344 (S. B. 135) (West). Even cockfighting, long considered immoral in much of
America, see Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment), is legal in Puerto Rico, see 15 Laws P. R. Ann. §301 (Supp. 2008);
Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R. (1986), and was legal
in Louisiana until 2008, see La. Stat. Ann. §14:102.23 (West) (effective Aug. 15,
2008). An otherwise-lawful image of any of these practices, if sold or possessed

Robson

857

The First Amendment

for commercial gain within a State that happens to forbid the practice, falls
within the prohibition of §48(a).
C
The only thing standing between defendants who sell such depictions and five
years in federal prison—other than the mercy of a prosecutor—is the statute’s
exceptions clause. Subsection (b) exempts from prohibition “any depiction that
has serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or
artistic value.” The Government argues that this clause substantially narrows
the statute’s reach: News reports about animal cruelty have “journalistic” value;
pictures of bullfights in Spain have “historical” value; and instructional hunting
videos have “educational” value. Thus, the Government argues, §48 reaches
only crush videos, depictions of animal fighting (other than Spanish
bullfighting), and perhaps other depictions of “extreme acts of animal cruelty.”
The Government’s attempt to narrow the statutory ban, however, requires an
unrealistically broad reading of the exceptions clause. As the Government reads
the clause, any material with “redeeming societal value,” Brief at 9, 16, 23, “ ‘at
least some minimal value,’ ” Reply Brief 6 (quoting H. R. Rep., at 4), or anything
more than “scant social value,” Reply Brief 11, is excluded under §48(b). But
the text says “serious” value, and “serious” should be taken seriously. We
decline the Government’s invitation—advanced for the first time in this Court—
to regard as “serious” anything that is not “scant.” (Or, as the dissent puts it,
“‘trifling.’”) As the Government recognized below, “serious” ordinarily means a
good bit more. The District Court’s jury instructions required value that is
“significant and of great import,” and the Government defended these
instructions as properly relying on “a commonly accepted meaning of the word
‘serious.’ ”
Quite apart from the requirement of “serious” value in §48(b), the excepted
speech must also fall within one of the enumerated categories. Much speech
does not. Most hunting videos, for example, are not obviously instructional in
nature, except in the sense that all life is a lesson. According to Safari Club
International and the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, many popular
videos “have primarily entertainment value” and are designed to “entertai[n] the
viewer, marke[t] hunting equipment, or increas[e] the hunting community.”
Brief for Safari Club International et al. as Amici Curiae 12. The National Rifle
Association agrees that “much of the content of hunting media … is merely
recreational in nature.” NRA Brief 28. The Government offers no principled
explanation why these depictions of hunting or depictions of Spanish bullfights
would be inherently valuable while those of Japanese dogfights are not. The
dissent contends that hunting depictions must have serious value because
hunting has serious value, in a way that dogfights presumably do not. But
§48(b) addresses the value of the depictions, not of the underlying activity.
There is simply no adequate reading of the exceptions clause that results in the
statute’s banning only the depictions the Government would like to ban.
The Government explains that the language of §48(b) was largely drawn from
our opinion in Miller v. California (1973), which excepted from its definition of
obscenity any material with “serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value.” According to the Government, this incorporation of the Miller standard
into §48 is therefore surely enough to answer any First Amendment objection.

Robson

858

The First Amendment

In Miller we held that “serious” value shields depictions of sex from regulation
as obscenity. Limiting Miller’s exception to “serious” value ensured that “ ‘[a]
quotation from Voltaire in the flyleaf of a book [would] not constitutionally
redeem an otherwise obscene publication.’ ” We did not, however, determine
that serious value could be used as a general precondition to protecting other
types of speech in the first place. Most of what we say to one another lacks
“religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic
value” (let alone serious value), but it is still sheltered from government
regulation. Even “ ‘[w]holly neutral futilities … come under the protection of free
speech as fully as do Keats’ poems or Donne’s sermons.’ ” Cohen v. California,
(1971).
Thus, the protection of the First Amendment presumptively extends to many
forms of speech that do not qualify for the serious-value exception of §48(b), but
nonetheless fall within the broad reach of §48(c).
D
Not to worry, the Government says: The Executive Branch construes §48 to
reach only “extreme” cruelty, Brief for United States 8, and it “neither has
brought nor will bring a prosecution for anything less,” Reply Brief 6–7. The
Government hits this theme hard, invoking its prosecutorial discretion several
times. See id., at 6–7, 10, and n. 6, 19, 22. But the First Amendment protects
against the Government; it does not leave us at the mercy of noblesse oblige. We
would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the Government
promised to use it responsibly.
This prosecution is itself evidence of the danger in putting faith in government
representations of prosecutorial restraint. When this legislation was enacted,
the Executive Branch announced that it would interpret §48 as covering only
depictions “of wanton cruelty to animals designed to appeal to a prurient
interest in sex.” See Statement by President William J. Clinton upon Signing H.
R. 1887, 34 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 2557 (Dec. 9, 1999). No one suggests that
the videos in this case fit that description. The Government’s assurance that it
will apply §48 far more restrictively than its language provides is pertinent only
as an implicit acknowledgment of the potential constitutional problems with a
more natural reading.
Nor can we rely upon the canon of construction that “ambiguous statutory
language [should] be construed to avoid serious constitutional doubts.” FCC v.
Fox Television Stations, Inc. (2009). “[T]his Court may impose a limiting
construction on a statute only if it is ‘readily susceptible’ to such a
construction.” Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union (1997). We “ ‘will not
rewrite a … law to conform it to constitutional requirements,’” for doing so
would constitute a “serious invasion of the legislative domain,” and sharply
diminish Congress’s “incentive to draft a narrowly tailored law in the first
place.” To read §48 as the Government desires requires rewriting, not just
reinterpretation.
Our construction of §48 decides the constitutional question; the Government
makes no effort to defend the constitutionality of §48 as applied beyond crush
videos and depictions of animal fighting. It argues that those particular
depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct or are analogous to

Robson

859

The First Amendment

obscenity (if not themselves obscene), and that the ban on such speech is
narrowly tailored to reinforce restrictions on the underlying conduct, prevent
additional crime arising from the depictions, or safeguard public mores. But the
Government nowhere attempts to extend these arguments to depictions of any
other activities—depictions that are presumptively protected by the First
Amendment but that remain subject to the criminal sanctions of §48.
Nor does the Government seriously contest that the presumptively
impermissible applications of §48 (properly construed) far outnumber any
permissible ones. However “growing” and “lucrative” the markets for crush
videos and dogfighting depictions might be, see Brief for United States 43, 46
(internal quotation marks omitted), they are dwarfed by the market for other
depictions, such as hunting magazines and videos, that we have determined to
be within the scope of §48. We therefore need not and do not decide whether a
statute limited to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty
would be constitutional. We hold only that §48 is not so limited but is instead
substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is
affirmed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE ALITO, DISSENTING.
The Court strikes down in its entirety a valuable statute, 18 U. S. C. §48, that
was enacted not to suppress speech, but to prevent horrific acts of animal
cruelty—in particular, the creation and commercial exploitation of “crush
videos,” a form of depraved entertainment that has no social value. The Court’s
approach, which has the practical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos and
is thus likely to spur a resumption of their production, is unwarranted.
Respondent was convicted under §48 for selling videos depicting dogfights. On
appeal, he argued, among other things, that §48 is unconstitutional as applied
to the facts of this case, and he highlighted features of those videos that might
distinguish them from other dogfight videos brought to our attention. The Court
of Appeals—incorrectly, in my view—declined to decide whether §48 is
unconstitutional as applied to respondent’s videos and instead reached out to
hold that the statute is facially invalid. Today’s decision does not endorse the
Court of Appeals’ reasoning, but it nevertheless strikes down §48 using what
has been aptly termed the “strong medicine” of the overbreadth doctrine.
Instead of applying the doctrine of overbreadth, I would vacate the decision
below and instruct the Court of Appeals on remand to decide whether the
videos that respondent sold are constitutionally protected. If the question of
overbreadth is to be decided, however, I do not think the present record
supports the Court’s conclusion that §48 bans a substantial quantity of
protected speech.

III
In holding that §48 violates the overbreadth rule, the Court declines to decide
whether, as the Government maintains, §48 is constitutional as applied to two
broad categories of depictions that exist in the real world: crush videos and
depictions of deadly animal fights. Instead, the Court tacitly assumes for the
sake of argument that §48 is valid as applied to these depictions, but the Court
concludes that §48 reaches too much protected speech to survive. The Court
relies primarily on depictions of hunters killing or wounding game and
depictions of animals being slaughtered for food. I address the Court’s examples
below.
A
I turn first to depictions of hunting. As the Court notes, photographs and videos
of hunters shooting game are common. But hunting is legal in all 50 States,
and §48 applies only to a depiction of conduct that is illegal in the jurisdiction
in which the depiction is created, sold, or possessed. Therefore, in all 50 States,
the creation, sale, or possession for sale of the vast majority of hunting
depictions indisputably falls outside §48’s reach.
Straining to find overbreadth, the Court suggests that §48 prohibits the sale or
possession in the District of Columbia of any depiction of hunting because the
District—undoubtedly because of its urban character—does not permit hunting
within its boundaries. The Court also suggests that, because some States
prohibit a particular type of hunting (e.g., hunting with a crossbow or “canned”
hunting) or the hunting of a particular animal (e.g., the “sharp-tailed grouse”),
§48 makes it illegal for persons in such States to sell or possess for sale a
depiction of hunting that was perfectly legal in the State in which the hunting
took place.
The Court’s interpretation is seriously flawed. “When a federal court is dealing
with a federal statute challenged as overbroad, it should, of course, construe
the statute to avoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to such a
limiting construction.”
Applying this canon, I would hold that §48 does not apply to depictions of
hunting. First, because §48 targets depictions of “animal cruelty,” I would
interpret that term to apply only to depictions involving acts of animal cruelty
as defined by applicable state or federal law, not to depictions of acts that
happen to be illegal for reasons having nothing to do with the prevention of
animal cruelty. ***
Second, even if the hunting of wild animals were otherwise covered by §48(a), I
would hold that hunting depictions fall within the exception in §48(b) for
depictions that have “serious” (i.e., not “trifling”) “scientific,” “educational,” or
“historical” value. While there are certainly those who find hunting
objectionable, the predominant view in this country has long been that hunting
serves many important values, and it is clear that Congress shares that view.
***
But even if §48 did impermissibly reach the sale or possession of depictions of
hunting in a few unusual situations (for example, the sale in Oregon of a

Robson

861

The First Amendment

depiction of hunting with a crossbow in Virginia or the sale in Washington State
of the hunting of a sharp-tailed grouse in Idaho, see ante, at 14), those isolated
applications would hardly show that §48 bans a substantial amount of
protected speech.
B
Although the Court’s overbreadth analysis rests primarily on the proposition
that §48 substantially restricts the sale and possession of hunting depictions,
the Court cites a few additional examples, including depictions of methods of
slaughter and the docking of the tails of dairy cows.
Such examples do not show that the statute is substantially overbroad, for two
reasons. First, as explained above, §48 can reasonably be construed to apply
only to depictions involving acts of animal cruelty as defined by applicable state
or federal law, and anti-cruelty laws do not ban the sorts of acts depicted in the
Court’s hypotheticals. ***
Second, nothing in the record suggests that any one has ever created, sold, or
possessed for sale a depiction of the slaughter of food animals or of the docking
of the tails of dairy cows that would not easily qualify under the exception set
out in §48(b). Depictions created to show proper methods of slaughter or taildocking would presumably have serious “educational” value, and depictions
created to focus attention on methods thought to be inhumane or otherwise
objectionable would presumably have either serious “educational” or
“journalistic” value or both. In short, the Court’s examples of depictions
involving the docking of tails and humane slaughter do not show that §48
suffers from any overbreadth, much less substantial overbreadth. ***
IV
A
1
As the Court of Appeals recognized, “the primary conduct that Congress sought
to address through its passage [of §48] was the creation, sale, or possession of
‘crush videos.’ ” A sample crush video, which has been lodged with the Clerk,
records the following event:
“[A] kitten, secured to the ground, watches and shrieks in pain as a woman
thrusts her high-heeled shoe into its body, slams her heel into the kitten’s eye
socket and mouth loudly fracturing its skull, and stomps repeatedly on the
animal’s head. The kitten hemorrhages blood, screams blindly in pain, and is
ultimately left dead in a moist pile of blood-soaked hair and bone.” Brief for
Humane Society of United States as Amicus Curiae 2 (hereinafter Humane
Society Brief).
It is undisputed that the conduct depicted in crush videos may constitutionally
be prohibited. All 50 States and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes
prohibiting animal cruelty. But before the enactment of §48, the underlying
conduct depicted in crush videos was nearly impossible to prosecute. These
videos, which “ often appeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish” were
made in secret, generally without a live audience, and “the faces of the women
inflicting the torture in the material often were not shown, nor could the
location of the place where the cruelty was being inflicted or the date of the
Robson

862

The First Amendment

activity be ascertained from the depiction.” Thus, law enforcement authorities
often were not able to identify the parties responsible for the torture. In the rare
instances in which it was possible to identify and find the perpetrators, they
“often were able to successfully assert as a defense that the State could not
prove its jurisdiction over the place where the act occurred or that the actions
depicted took place within the time specified in the State statute of limitations.”
In light of the practical problems thwarting the prosecution of the creators of
crush videos under state animal cruelty laws, Congress concluded that the only
effective way of stopping the underlying criminal conduct was to prohibit the
commercial exploitation of the videos of that conduct. And Congress’ strategy
appears to have been vindicated. We are told that “[b]y 2007, sponsors of §48
declared the crush video industry dead. Even overseas Websites shut down in
the wake of §48. Now, after the Third Circuit’s decision [facially invalidating the
statute], crush videos are already back online.” Humane Society Brief 5
(citations omitted).
2
The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but it most certainly does not
protect violent criminal conduct, even if engaged in for expressive purposes.
Crush videos present a highly unusual free speech issue because they are so
closely linked with violent criminal conduct. The videos record the commission
of violent criminal acts, and it appears that these crimes are committed for the
sole purpose of creating the videos. ***
The most relevant of our prior decisions is Ferber which concerned child
pornography. The Court there held that child pornography is not protected
speech, and I believe that Ferber’s reasoning dictates a similar conclusion here.
*** It must be acknowledged that §48 differs from a child pornography law in an
important respect: preventing the abuse of children is certainly much more
important than preventing the torture of the animals used in crush videos. It
was largely for this reason that the Court of Appeals concluded that Ferber did
not support the constitutionality of §48. But while protecting children is
unquestionably more important than protecting animals, the Government also
has a compelling interest in preventing the torture depicted in crush videos.
***
In short, Ferber is the case that sheds the most light on the
constitutionality of Congress’ effort to halt the production of crush videos.
Applying the principles set forth in Ferber, I would hold that crush videos are
not protected by the First Amendment.
B
Application of the Ferber framework also supports the constitutionality of §48
as applied to depictions of brutal animal fights. (For convenience, I will focus on
videos of dogfights, which appear to be the most common type of animal fight
videos.)
First, such depictions, like crush videos, record the actual commission of a
crime involving deadly violence. Dogfights are illegal in every State and the
District of Columbia and under federal law constitute a felony punishable by
imprisonment for up to five years.

Robson

863

The First Amendment

Second, Congress had an ample basis for concluding that the crimes depicted
in these videos cannot be effectively controlled without targeting the videos.
Like crush videos and child pornography, dogfight videos are very often
produced as part of a “low-profile, clandestine industry,” and “the need to
market the resulting products requires a visible apparatus of distribution.” In
such circumstances, Congress had reasonable grounds for concluding that it
would be “difficult, if not impossible, to halt” the underlying exploitation of dogs
by pursuing only those who stage the fights.
*** For these dogs, unlike the animals killed in crush videos, the suffering lasts
for years rather than minutes. As with crush videos, moreover, the statutory
ban on commerce in dogfighting videos is also supported by compelling
governmental interests in effectively enforcing the Nation’s criminal laws and
preventing criminals from profiting from their illegal activities.
In sum, §48 may validly be applied to at least two broad real-world categories of
expression covered by the statute: crush videos and dogfighting videos. Thus,
the statute has a substantial core of constitutionally permissible applications.
Moreover, for the reasons set forth above, the record does not show that §48,
properly interpreted, bans a substantial amount of protected speech in absolute
terms. A fortiori, respondent has not met his burden of demonstrating that any
impermissible applications of the statute are “substantial” in relation to its
“plainly legitimate sweep.” Accordingly, I would reject respondent’s claim that
§48 is facially unconstitutional under the overbreadth doctrine.
For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.

ROBERTS, C. J., JOINED. THOMAS, J., AND BREYER, J., FILED DISSENTING OPINIONS.

JUSTICE SCALIA DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
We consider whether a California law imposing restrictions on violent video
games comports with the First Amendment.
I
California Assembly Bill 1179 (2005), Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §§1746–1746.5 (West
2009) (Act), prohibits the sale or rental of “violent video games” to minors, and
requires their packaging to be labeled “18.” The Act covers games “in which the
range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering,
or sexually assaulting an image of a human being, if those acts are depicted” in
a manner that “[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would
find appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors,” that is “patently
offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for
minors,” and that “causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value for minors.” Violation of the Act is punishable by a
civil fine of up to $1,000. Respondents, representing the video-game and
software industries, brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act in the

Robson

864

The First Amendment

United States District Court for the Northern District of California. That court
concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined
its enforcement. The Court of Appeals affirmed and we granted certiorari.
II
California correctly acknowledges that video games qualify for First Amendment
protection. The Free Speech Clause exists principally to protect discourse on
public matters, but we have long recognized that it is difficult to distinguish
politics from entertainment, and dangerous to try. “Everyone is familiar with
instances of propaganda through fiction. What is one man’s amusement,
teaches another’s doctrine.” Winters v. New York (1948). Like the protected
books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate
ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such
as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the
medium (such as the player’s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices
to confer First Amendment protection. Under our Constitution, “esthetic and
moral judgments about art and literature . . . are for the individual to make, not
for the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority.”
United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. (2000). And whatever the
challenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing technology, “the basic
principles of freedom of speech and the press, like the First Amendment’s
command, do not vary” when a new and different medium for communication
appears. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson (1952).
The most basic of those principles is this: “[A]s a general matter, . . .
government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its
ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties
Union (2002). There are of course exceptions. “ ‘From 1791 to the present,’ . . .
the First Amendment has ‘permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in
a few limited areas,’ and has never ‘include[d] a freedom to disregard these
traditional limitations.’ ” United States v. Stevens (2010). These limited areas—
such as obscenity, Roth v. United States (1957), incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio
(1969) (per curiam), and fighting words, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942)—
represent “well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention
and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional
problem.”
Last Term, in Stevens, we held that new categories of unprotected speech may
not be added to the list by a legislature that concludes certain speech is too
harmful to be tolerated. ***
That holding controls this case. As in Stevens, California has tried to make
violent-speech regulation look like obscenity regulation by appending a saving
clause required for the latter. That does not suffice. Our cases have been clear
that the obscenity exception to the First Amendment does not cover whatever a
legislature finds shocking, but only depictions of “sexual conduct,” Miller.
Stevens was not the first time we have encountered and rejected a State’s
attempt to shoehorn speech about violence into obscenity. In Winters, we
considered a New York criminal statute “forbid[ding] the massing of stories of
bloodshed and lust in such a way as to incite to crime against the person.” The
New York Court of Appeals upheld the provision as a law against obscenity.

Robson

865

The First Amendment

“[T]here can be no more precise test of written indecency or obscenity,” it said,
“than the continuing and changeable experience of the community as to what
types of books are likely to bring about the corruption of public morals or other
analogous injury to the public order. ” That is of course the same expansive
view of governmental power to abridge the freedom of speech based on interestbalancing that we rejected in Stevens. Our opinion in Winters, which concluded
that the New York statute failed a heightened vagueness standard applicable to
restrictions upon speech entitled to First Amendment protection, made clear
that violence is not part of the obscenity that the Constitution permits to be
regulated. The speech reached by the statute contained “no indecency or
obscenity in any sense heretofore known to the law.” Because speech about
violence is not obscene, it is of no consequence that California’s statute mimics
the New York statute regulating obscenity-for-minors that we upheld in
Ginsberg v. New York (1968). That case approved a prohibition on the sale to
minors of sexual material that would be obscene from the perspective of a child.
We held that the legislature could “adjus[t] the definition of obscenity ‘to social
realities by permitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in terms
of the sexual interests . . .’ of . . . minors. ” And because “obscenity is not
protected expression,” the New York statute could be sustained so long as the
legislature’s judgment that the proscribed materials were harmful to children
“was not irrational.”
The California Act is something else entirely. It does not adjust the boundaries
of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition
designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children. California does not
argue that it is empowered to prohibit selling offensively violent works to
adults—and it is wise not to, since that is but a hair’s breadth from the
argument rejected in Stevens. Instead, it wishes to create a wholly new category
of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at
children.
*** California’s argument would fare better if there were a longstanding
tradition in this country of specially restricting children’s access to depictions of
violence, but there is none. Certainly the books we give children to read—or
read to them when they are younger—contain no shortage of gore. Grimm’s
Fairy Tales, for example, are grim indeed. As her just deserts for trying to
poison Snow White, the wicked queen is made to dance in red hot slippers “till
she fell dead on the floor, a sad example of envy and jealousy.” Cinderella’s evil
stepsisters have their eyes pecked out by doves. And Hansel and Gretel
(children!) kill their captor by baking her in an oven.
High-school reading lists are full of similar fare. Homer’s Odysseus blinds
Polyphemus the Cyclops by grinding out his eye with a heated stake. In the
Inferno, Dante and Virgil watch corrupt politicians struggle to stay submerged
beneath a lake of boiling pitch, lest they be skewered by devils above the
surface. And Golding’s Lord of the Flies recounts how a schoolboy called Piggy
is savagely murdered by other children while marooned on an island.
This is not to say that minors’ consumption of violent entertainment has never
encountered resistance. In the 1800’s, dime novels depicting crime and “penny
dreadfuls” (named for their price and content) were blamed in some quarters for
juvenile delinquency. When motion pictures came along, they became the

Robson

866

The First Amendment

villains instead. “The days when the police looked upon dime novels as the most
dangerous of textbooks in the school for crime are drawing to a close. . . . They
say that the moving picture machine . . . tends even more than did the dime
novel to turn the thoughts of the easily influenced to paths which sometimes
lead to prison.” Moving Pictures as Helps to Crime, N. Y. Times, Feb. 21, 1909,
quoted in Brief for Cato Institute, at 8. For a time, our Court did permit broad
censorship of movies because of their capacity to be “used for evil,” see Mutual
Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm’n of Ohio (1915), but we eventually reversed
course. Many in the late 1940’s and early 1950’s blamed comic books for
fostering a “preoccupation with violence and horror” among the young, leading
to a rising juvenile crime rate. But efforts to convince Congress to restrict comic
books failed. And, of course, after comic books came television and music lyrics.
California claims that video games present special problems because they are
“interactive,” in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and
determines its outcome. The latter feature is nothing new: Since at least the
publication of The Adventures of You: Sugarcane Island in 1969, young readers
of choose-your-own adventure stories have been able to make decisions that
determine the plot by following instructions about which page to turn to. As for
the argument that video games enable participation in the violent action, that
seems to us more a matter of degree than of kind. As Judge Posner has
observed, all literature is interactive. “[T]he better it is, the more interactive.
Literature when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him
identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them,
to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader’s own.” American
Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick, 244 F. 3d 572 (7th Cir. 2001) (striking
down a similar restriction on violent video games).
Justice Alito [concurring] has done considerable independent research to
identify video games in which “the violence is astounding.” “Victims are
dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little
pieces. . . . Blood gushes, splatters, and pools.” Justice Alito recounts all these
disgusting video games in order to disgust us—but disgust is not a valid basis
for restricting expression. And the same is true of Justice Alito’s description of
those video games he has discovered that have a racial or ethnic motive for
their violence—“ ‘ethnic cleansing’ [of] . . . African Americans, Latinos, or Jews.”
To what end does he relate this? Does it somehow increase the “aggressiveness”
that California wishes to suppress? Who knows? But it does arouse the reader’s
ire, and the reader’s desire to put an end to this horrible message. Thus,
ironically, Justice Alito’s argument highlights the precise danger posed by the
California Act: that the ideas expressed by speech—whether it be violence, or
gore, or racism—and not its objective effects, may be the real reason for
governmental proscription.
III
Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is
invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny—that is,
unless it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn
to serve that interest. R. A. V. The State must specifically identify an “actual
problem” in need of solving and the curtailment of free speech must be actually

Robson

867

The First Amendment

necessary to the solution. That is a demanding standard. “It is rare that a
regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.”
California cannot meet that standard. ***
The State’s evidence is not compelling. California relies primarily on the
research of Dr. Craig Anderson and a few other research psychologists whose
studies purport to show a connection between exposure to violent video games
and harmful effects on children. These studies have been rejected by every
court to consider them, and with good reason: They do not prove that violent
video games cause minors to act aggressively (which would at least be a
beginning). *** They show at best some correlation between exposure to violent
entertainment and minuscule real-world effects, such as children’s feeling more
aggressive or making louder noises in the few minutes after playing a violent
game than after playing a nonviolent game.
Even taking for granted Dr. Anderson’s conclusions that violent video games
produce some effect on children’s feelings of aggression, those effects are both
small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media. In his
testimony in a similar lawsuit, Dr. Anderson admitted that the “effect sizes” of
children’s exposure to violent video games are “about the same” as that
produced by their exposure to violence on television. And he admits that the
same effects have been found when children watch cartoons starring Bugs
Bunny or the Road Runner, or when they play video games like Sonic the
Hedgehog that are rated “E” (appropriate for all ages) or even when they “vie[w]
a picture of a gun.” Of course, California has (wisely) declined to restrict
Saturday morning cartoons, the sale of games rated for young children, or the
distribution of pictures of guns. The consequence is that its regulation is wildly
underinclusive when judged against its asserted justification, which in our view
is alone enough to defeat it. Underinclusiveness raises serious doubts about
whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than
disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. Here, California has singled out
the purveyors of video games for disfavored treatment—at least when compared
to booksellers, cartoonists, and movie producers—and has given no persuasive
reason why.
The Act is also seriously underinclusive in another respect—and a respect that
renders irrelevant the contentions of the concurrence and the dissents that
video games are qualitatively different from other portrayals of violence. The
California Legislature is perfectly willing to leave this dangerous, mind-altering
material in the hands of children so long as one parent (or even an aunt or
uncle) says it’s OK. And there are not even any requirements as to how this
parental or avuncular relationship is to be verified; apparently the child’s or
putative parent’s, aunt’s, or uncle’s say-so suffices. That is not how one
addresses a serious social problem.***
But leaving that aside, California cannot show that the Act’s restrictions meet a
substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children’s access to
violent video games but cannot do so. The video-game industry has in place a
voluntary rating system designed to inform consumers about the content of
games. The system, implemented by the Entertainment Software Rating Board
(ESRB), assigns age-specific ratings to each video game submitted: EC (Early

Robson

868

The First Amendment

Childhood); E (Everyone); E10+ (Everyone 10 and older); T (Teens); M (17 and
older); and AO (Adults Only—18 and older). The Video Software Dealers
Association encourages retailers to prominently display information about the
ESRB system in their stores; to refrain from renting or selling adultsonly games
to minors; and to rent or sell “M” rated games to minors only with parental
consent. In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that, as a result
of this system, “the video game industry outpaces the movie and music
industries” in “(1) restricting targetmarketing of mature-rated products to
children; (2) clearly and prominently disclosing rating information; and (3)
restricting children’s access to mature-rated products at retail.” FTC, Report to
Congress, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 30 (Dec. 2009). This
system does much to ensure that minors cannot purchase seriously violent
games on their own, and that parents who care about the matter can readily
evaluate the games their children bring home. Filling the remaining modest gap
in concerned-parents’ control can hardly be a compelling state interest.
And finally, the Act’s purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive.
Not all of the children who are forbidden to purchase violent video games on
their own have parents who care whether they purchase violent video games.
While some of the legislation’s effect may indeed be in support of what some
parents of the restricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in
support of what the State thinks parents ought to want. This is not the narrow
tailoring to “assisting parents” that restriction of First Amendment rights
requires.
California’s effort to regulate violent video games is the latest episode in a long
series of failed attempts to censor violent entertainment for minors. While we
have pointed out above that some of the evidence brought forward to support
the harmfulness of video games is unpersuasive, we do not mean to demean or
disparage the concerns that underlie the attempt to regulate them—concerns
that may and doubtless do prompt a good deal of parental oversight. We have
no business passing judgment on the view of the California Legislature that
violent video games (or, for that matter, any other forms of speech) corrupt the
young or harm their moral development. Our task is only to say whether or not
such works constitute a “well-defined and narrowly limited clas[s] of speech, the
prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any
Constitutional problem,” Chaplinsky (the answer plainly is no); and if not,
whether the regulation of such works is justified by that high degree of
necessity we have described as a compelling state interest (it is not). Even
where the protection of children is the object, the constitutional limits on
governmental action apply.
California’s legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious
social problem and (2) helping concerned parents control their children. Both
ends are legitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights they must be
pursued by means that are neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously
overinclusive. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah (1993). As a
means of protecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is
seriously underinclusive, not only because it excludes portrayals other than
video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto. And as a
means of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it

abridges the First Amendment rights of young people whose parents (and aunts
and uncles) think violent video games are a harmless pastime. And the
overbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving
the other. Legislation such as this, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot
survive strict scrutiny.
We affirm the judgment below. It is so ordered.
JUSTICE ALITO, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE JOINS, CONCURRING IN THE
JUDGMENT.
The California statute that is before us in this case represents a pioneering
effort to address what the state legislature and others regard as a potentially
serious social problem: the effect of exceptionally violent video games on
impressionable minors, who often spend countless hours immersed in the
alternative worlds that these games create. Although the California statute is
well intentioned, its terms are not framed with the precision that the
Constitution demands, and I therefore agree with the Court that this particular
law cannot be sustained.
I disagree, however, with the approach taken in the Court’s opinion. In
considering the application of unchanging constitutional principles to new and
rapidly evolving technology, this Court should proceed with caution. We should
make every effort to understand the new technology. We should take into
account the possibility that developing technology may have important societal
implications that will become apparent only with time. We should not jump to
the conclusion that new technology is fundamentally the same as some older
thing with which we are familiar. And we should not hastily dismiss the
judgment of legislators, who may be in a better position than we are to assess
the implications of new technology. The opinion of the Court exhibits none of
this caution.
In the view of the Court, all those concerned about the effects of violent video
games—federal and state legislators, educators, social scientists, and parents—
are unduly fearful, for violent video games really present no serious problem.
Spending hour upon hour controlling the actions of a character who guns down
scores of innocent victims is not different in “kind” from reading a description of
violence in a work of literature.
The Court is sure of this; I am not. There are reasons to suspect that the
experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from
reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show.
I
Respondents in this case, representing the video-game industry, ask us to
strike down the California law on two grounds: The broad ground adopted by
the Court and the narrower ground that the law’s definition of “violent video
game” is impermissibly vague. Because I agree with the latter argument, I see
no need to reach the broader First Amendment issues addressed by the Court.

The First Amendment

*** When all of the characteristics of video games are taken into account, there
is certainly a reasonable basis for thinking that the experience of playing a
video game may be quite different from the experience of reading a book,
listening to a radio broadcast, or viewing a movie. And if this is so, then for at
least some minors, the effects of playing violent video games may also be quite
different. The Court acts prematurely in dismissing this possibility out of hand.
* * * For all these reasons, I would hold only that the particular law at issue
here fails to provide the clear notice that the Constitution requires. I would not
squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a
significant and developing social problem.
JUSTICE THOMAS, DISSENTING.
The Court’s decision today does not comport with the original public
understanding of the First Amendment. The majority strikes down, as facially
unconstitutional, a state law that prohibits the direct sale or rental of certain
video games to minors because the law “abridg[es] the freedom of speech.” U. S.
Const., Amdt. 1. But I do not think the First Amendment stretches that far. The
practices and beliefs of the founding generation establish that “the freedom of
speech,” as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors
(or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors’
parents or guardians. I would hold that the law at issue is not facially
unconstitutional under the First Amendment, and reverse and remand for
further proceedings.
*** [extensive opinion omitted]
JUSTICE BREYER, DISSENTING.
California imposes a civil fine of up to $1,000 upon any person who distributes
a violent video game in California without labeling it “18,” or who sells or rents
a labeled violent video game to a person under the age of 18. Representatives of
the video game and software industries, claiming that the statute violates the
First Amendment on its face, seek an injunction against its enforcement.
Applying traditional First Amendment analysis, I would uphold the statute as
constitutional on its face and would consequently reject the industries’ facial
challenge.
I.
*** [T]he special First Amendment category I find relevant is *** the category of
“protection of children.” This Court has held that the “power of the state to
control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over
adults.” Prince v. Massachusetts (1944). And the “‘regulatio[n] of communication
addressed to [children] need not conform to the requirements of the [F]irst
[A]mendment in the same way as those applicable to adults.’ ” Ginsberg v. New
York (1968).
The majority’s claim that the California statute, if upheld, would create a “new
categor[y] of unprotected speech” is overstated. No one here argues that
depictions of violence, even extreme violence, automatically fall outside the First
Robson

871

The First Amendment

Amendment’s protective scope as, for example, do obscenity and depictions of
child pornography. We properly speak of categories of expression that lack
protection when, like “child pornography,” the category is broad, when it applies
automatically, and when the State can prohibit everyone, including adults, from
obtaining access to the material within it. But where, as here, careful analysis
must precede a narrower judicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout
of “fire” in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terrorist group how to
peacefully petition the United Nations), we do not normally describe the result
as creating a “new category of unprotected speech.” See Schenck v. United States
(1919); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project (2010). Thus, in Stevens, after
rejecting the claim that all depictions of animal cruelty (a category) fall outside
the First Amendment’s protective scope, we went on to decide whether the
particular statute at issue violates the First Amendment under traditional
standards; and we held that, because the statute was overly broad, it was
invalid. Similarly, here the issue is whether, applying traditional First
Amendment standards, this statute does, or does not, pass muster.
II
In my view, California’s statute provides “fair notice of what is prohibited,” and
consequently it is not impermissibly vague. Ginsberg explains why that is so.
The Court there considered a New York law that forbade the sale to minors of a
“picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion picture film, or similar visual
representation or image of a person or portion of the human body which depicts
nudity . . . ,” that “predominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid
interest of minors,” and “is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the
adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for
minors,” and “is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.” This
Court upheld the New York statute in Ginsberg (which is sometimes
unfortunately confused with a very different, earlier case, Ginzburg v. United
States, (1966)). The five-Justice majority, in an opinion written by Justice
Brennan, wrote that the statute was sufficiently clear. No Member of the Court
voiced any vagueness objection.
Comparing the language of California’s statute with the language of New York’s
statute it is difficult to find any vagueness-related difference. Why are the words
“kill,” “maim,” and “dismember” any more difficult to understand than the word
“nudity?” ***
The remainder of California’s definition copies, almost word for word, the
language this Court used in Miller v. California (1973), in permitting a total ban
on material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with criminal penalties).
***
Both the Miller standard and the law upheld in Ginsberg lack perfect clarity.
But that fact reflects the difficulty of the Court’s long search for words capable
of protecting expression without depriving the State of a legitimate
constitutional power to regulate. As is well known, at one point Justice Stewart
thought he could do no better in defining obscenity than, “I know it when I see
it.” Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964) (concurring opinion). And Justice Douglas
dissented from Miller’s standard, which he thought was still too vague.
Ultimately, however, this Court accepted the “community standards” tests used
in Miller and Ginsberg. They reflect the fact that sometimes, even when a

Robson

872

The First Amendment

precise standard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify instances that fall
within a legitimate regulation. And they seek to draw a line, which, while
favoring free expression, will nonetheless permit a legislature to find the words
necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional objective.
IV
The upshot is that California’s statute, as applied to its heartland of
applications (i.e., buyers under 17; extremely violent, realistic video games),
imposes a restriction on speech that is modest at most. That restriction is
justified by a compelling interest (supplementing parents’ efforts to prevent
their children from purchasing potentially harmful violent, interactive material).
And there is no equally effective, less restrictive alternative. California’s statute
is consequently constitutional on its face—though litigants remain free to
challenge the statute as applied in particular instances, including any effort by
the State to apply it to minors aged 17.
I add that the majority’s different conclusion creates a serious anomaly in First
Amendment law. Ginsberg makes clear that a State can prohibit the sale to
minors of depictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a State cannot
prohibit the sale to minors of the most violent interactive video games. But what
sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an
image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13-year-old of an
interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the
woman, then tortures and kills her? What kind of First Amendment would
permit the government to protect children by restricting sales of that extremely
violent video game only when the woman—bound, gagged, tortured, and
killed—is also topless?
This anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment. It disappears once one
recognizes that extreme violence, where interactive, and without literary,
artistic, or similar justification, can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to
children as photographs of nudity. And the record here is more than adequate
to support such a view. That is why I believe that Ginsberg controls the outcome
here a fortiori. And it is why I believe California’s law is constitutional on its
face.
This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education. Our
Constitution cannot succeed in securing the liberties it seeks to protect unless
we can raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system
of government work. Education, however, is about choices. Sometimes, children
need to learn by making choices for themselves. Other times, choices are made
for children—by their parents, by their teachers, and by the people acting
democratically through their governments. In my view, the First Amendment
does not disable government from helping parents make such a choice here—a
choice not to have their children buy extremely violent, interactive video games,
which they more than reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those
children.
For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.

Note:	  Reconsidering	  the	  Categorical	  Approach	  
1.
After the Court’s decision in United States v. Stevens, Congress
passed - - - and President Obama signed - - - the Animal Crush Video
Prohibition Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111–294, now codified at 18 U.S.C. §48.
Congress reasserted its findings that there are "certain extreme acts of
animal cruelty that appeal to a specific sexual fetish. These acts of
extreme animal cruelty are videotaped, and the resulting video tapes are
commonly referred to as 'animal crush videos.’ "
The statute defines
'animal crush video' as "any photograph, motion-picture film, video or
digital recording, or electronic image that—
(1) depicts actual conduct in which 1 or more living nonhuman mammals, birds,
reptiles, or amphibians is intentionally crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated,
impaled, or otherwise subjected to serious bodily injury . . . . and
(2) is obscene.

Note that the definition does not include insects. The statute specifically
exempts any visual depiction of
(A) customary and normal veterinary or agricultural husbandry practices;
(B) the slaughter of animals for food; or
(C) hunting, trapping, or fishing.

The Fifth Circuit in United States v. Richards, 755 F.3d 269 (5th Cir.
2014), upheld the statute. The defendants, who were engaged in “crush
porn” videos unlike Stevens, argued that even if § 48 is limited to Miller
obscenity, it nonetheless is facially unconstitutional because it violates
the rationale set forth in R.A. V. v. City of St. Paul (1992). The Fifth
Circuit panel highlighted the exceptions in R.A.V.:
First, “[w]hen the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the
very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable, no significant
danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists.... A State might choose to
prohibit only that obscenity which is the most patently offensive in its
prurience—i.e., that which involves the most lascivious displays of sexual
activity.” R.A.V. Second, “[a]nother valid basis for according differential
treatment to even a content-defined subclass of prescribable speech is that the
subclass happens to be associated with particular secondary effects of the
speech, so that the regulation is justified without reference to the content of the
... speech.” Id. (citing Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. (1986)). “A State could, for
example, permit all obscene live performances except those involving minors.”
Id. Third, “[t]o validate such selectivity (where totally prescribable speech is at
issue) it may not even be necessary to identify any particular ‘neutral’ basis, so
long as the nature of the content discrimination is such that there is no realistic
possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.” Id.

(ellipses in original). Interestingly the Fifth Circuit focused on the second
exception - - - the secondary effects doctrine and stated that the statute
Robson

874

The First Amendment

“regulates a content-defined subclass based on its secondary effects and
is justified without reference to the content of the speech.” It stated:
§ 48 is justified with reference not to the content of such a message but rather
to its secondary effects-wanton torture and killing that, as demonstrated by
federal and state animal-cruelty laws, society has deemed worthy of criminal
sanction. See 156 Cong. Rec. S7653–54 (2010) (“The other element that occurs
in animal crush videos and which warrants a higher punishment than simple
obscenity is that it involves the intentional torture or pain to a living animal.
Congress finds this combination deplorable and worthy of special punishment.”).

Does this analysis satisfy the concerns the Court raised in Stevens? The
United States Supreme Court denied certiorari.
United States v.
Richards, 755 F.3d 269 (5th Cir. 2014) cert. denied sub nom. Justice v.
United States, 135 S. Ct. 1546 (2015) and cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 1547
(2015).
2.
The Court declined to extend the categorical exception to “animal
cruelty” in Stevens and to violence in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants
Association. Are you satisfied with the limited number of types of speech
in the categorical exceptions? Should “obscenity” be one of them?

JUSTICE CLARK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH WARREN, C.J., AND BLACK,
HARLAN, BRENNAN, STEWART, WHITE, AND GOLDBERG, J.J., JOINED. DOUGLAS, J., FILED A
CONCURRING OPINION.

JUSTICE CLARK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
These cases involve claims of conscientious objectors under 6 (j) of the
Universal Military Training and Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. 456 (j) (1958 ed.),
which exempts from combatant training and service in the armed forces of the
United States those persons who by reason of their religious training and belief
are conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. The cases were
consolidated for argument and we consider them together although each
involves different facts and circumstances. The parties raise the basic question
of the constitutionality of the section which defines the term "religious training
and belief," as used in the Act, as "an individual's belief in a relation to a
Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human
relation, but [not including] essentially political, sociological, or philosophical
views or a merely personal moral code." The constitutional attack is launched
under the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses and is
twofold: (1) The section does not exempt nonreligious conscientious objectors;
and (2) it discriminates between different forms of religious expression in
violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. *** We granted
certiorari in each of the cases because of their importance in the administration
of the Act.
We have concluded that Congress, in using the expression "Supreme Being"
rather than the designation "God," was merely clarifying the meaning of
religious training and belief so as to embrace all religions and to exclude
essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views. We believe that under
this construction, the test of belief "in a relation to a Supreme Being" is

Robson

877

The First Amendment

whether a given belief that is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life
of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God of one who
clearly qualifies for the exemption. Where such beliefs have parallel positions in
the lives of their respective holders we cannot say that one is "in a relation to a
Supreme Being" and the other is not. We have concluded that the beliefs of the
objectors in these cases meet these criteria. ***
THE FACTS IN THE CASES.
No. 50: Seeger was convicted in the District Court for the Southern District of
New York of having refused to submit to induction in the armed forces. He was
originally classified 1-A in 1953 by his local board, but this classification was
changed in 1955 to 2-S (student) and he remained in this status until 1958
when he was reclassified 1-A. He first claimed exemption as a conscientious
objector in 1957 after successive annual renewals of his student classification.
Although he did not adopt verbatim the printed Selective Service System form,
he declared that he was conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any
form by reason of his "religious" belief; that he preferred to leave the question as
to his belief in a Supreme Being open, "rather than answer `yes' or `no'"; that
his "skepticism or disbelief in the existence of God" did "not necessarily mean
lack of faith in anything whatsoever"; that his was a "belief in and devotion to
goodness and virtue for their own sakes, and a religious faith in a purely ethical
creed." He cited such personages as Plato, Aristotle and Spinoza for support of
his ethical belief in intellectual and moral integrity "without belief in God,
except in the remotest sense." His belief was found to be sincere, honest, and
made in good faith; and his conscientious objection to be based upon individual
training and belief, both of which included research in religious and cultural
fields. Seeger's claim, however, was denied solely because it was not based
upon a "belief in a relation to a Supreme Being" as required by 6 (j) of the Act.
At trial Seeger's counsel admitted that Seeger's belief was not in relation to a
Supreme Being as commonly understood, but contended that he was entitled to
the exemption because "under the present law Mr. Seeger's position would also
include definitions of religion which have been stated more recently," and could
be "accommodated" under the definition of religious training and belief in the
Act. He was convicted and the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the
Supreme Being requirement of the section distinguished "between internally
derived and externally compelled beliefs" and was, therefore, an "impermissible
classification" under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
*** [facts of companion cases omitted]
BACKGROUND OF 6 (j).
Chief Justice Hughes, in his opinion in United States v. Macintosh (1931),
enunciated the rationale behind the long recognition of conscientious objection
to participation in war accorded by Congress in our various conscription laws
when he declared that "in the forum of conscience, duty to a moral power
higher than the State has always been maintained." In a similar vein Harlan
Fiske Stone, later Chief Justice, drew from the Nation's past when he declared
that
"both morals and sound policy require that the state should not violate the
conscience of the individual. All our history gives confirmation to the view that
liberty of conscience has a moral and social value which makes it worthy of

Robson

878

The First Amendment

preservation at the hands of the state. So deep in its significance and vital,
indeed, is it to the integrity of man's moral and spiritual nature that nothing
short of the self-preservation of the state should warrant its violation; and it may
well be questioned whether the state which preserves its life by a settled policy
of violation of the conscience of the individual will not in fact ultimately lose it by
the process."

Stone, The Conscientious Objector, 21 COL. UNIV. Q. 253, 269 (1919).
Governmental recognition of the moral dilemma posed for persons of certain
religious faiths by the call to arms came early in the history of this country.
Various methods of ameliorating their difficulty were adopted by the Colonies,
and were later perpetuated in state statutes and constitutions. Thus by the
time of the Civil War there existed a state pattern of exempting conscientious
objectors on religious grounds. ***
The need for conscription did not again arise until World War I. The Draft Act of
1917, 40 Stat. 76, 78, afforded exemptions to conscientious objectors who were
affiliated with a "well-recognized religious sect or organization [then] organized
and existing and whose existing creed or principles [forbade] its members to
participate in war in any form . . . ." The Act required that all persons be
inducted into the armed services, but allowed the conscientious objectors to
perform noncombatant service in capacities designated by the President of the
United States. Although the 1917 Act excused religious objectors only, in
December 1917, the Secretary of War instructed that "personal scruples against
war" be considered as constituting "conscientious objection." This Act, including
its conscientious objector provisions, was upheld against constitutional attack
in the Selective Draft Law Cases (1918).
In adopting the 1940 Selective Training and Service Act Congress broadened
the exemption afforded in the 1917 Act by making it unnecessary to belong to a
pacifist religious sect if the claimant's own opposition to war was based on
"religious training and belief." Those found to be within the exemption were not
inducted into the armed services but were assigned to noncombatant service
under the supervision of the Selective Service System. The Congress recognized
that one might be religious without belonging to an organized church just as
surely as minority members of a faith not opposed to war might through
religious reading reach a conviction against participation in war. Indeed, the
consensus of the witnesses appearing before the congressional committees was
that individual belief - rather than membership in a church or sect determined the duties that God imposed upon a person in his everyday
conduct; and that "there is a higher loyalty than loyalty to this country, loyalty
to God." Thus, while shifting the test from membership in such a church to
one's individual belief the Congress nevertheless continued its historic practice
of excusing from armed service those who believed that they owed an obligation,
superior to that due the state, of not participating in war in any form.
Between 1940 and 1948 two courts of appeals held that the phrase "religious
training and belief" did not include philosophical, social or political policy. Then
in 1948 the Congress amended the language of the statute and declared that
"religious training and belief" was to be defined as "an individual's belief in a
relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any
human relation, but [not including] essentially political, sociological, or

Robson

879

The First Amendment

philosophical views or a merely personal moral code." The only significant
mention of this change in the provision appears in the report of the Senate
Armed Services Committee recommending adoption. It said simply this: "This
section reenacts substantially the same provisions as were found in subsection
5 (g) of the 1940 act. Exemption extends to anyone who, because of religious
training and belief in his relation to a Supreme Being, is conscientiously
opposed to combatant military service or to both combatant and noncombatant
military service.
INTERPRETATION OF 6 (j).
1. The crux of the problem lies in the phrase "religious training and belief"
which Congress has defined as "belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving
duties superior to those arising from any human relation." In assigning
meaning to this statutory language we may narrow the inquiry by noting briefly
those scruples expressly excepted from the definition. The section excludes
those persons who, disavowing religious belief, decide on the basis of essentially
political, sociological or economic considerations that war is wrong and that
they will have no part of it. These judgments have historically been reserved for
the Government, and in matters which can be said to fall within these areas the
conviction of the individual has never been permitted to override that of the
state. The statute further excludes those whose opposition to war stems from a
"merely personal moral code," a phrase to which we shall have occasion to turn
later in discussing the application of 6 (j) to these cases. We also pause to take
note of what is not involved in this litigation. No party claims to be an atheist or
attacks the statute on this ground. The question is not, therefore, one between
theistic and atheistic beliefs. We do not deal with or intimate any decision on
that situation in these cases. Nor do the parties claim the monotheistic belief
that there is but one God; what they claim (with the possible exception of
Seeger who bases his position here not on factual but on purely constitutional
grounds) is that they adhere to theism, which is the "Belief in the existence of a
god or gods; . . . Belief in superhuman powers or spiritual agencies in one or
many gods," as opposed to atheism. Our question, therefore, is the narrow one:
Does the term "Supreme Being" as used in 6 (j) mean the orthodox God or the
broader concept of a power or being, or a faith, "to which all else is subordinate
or upon which all else is ultimately dependent"? Webster's New International
Dictionary (Second Edition). In considering this question we resolve it solely in
relation to the language of 6 (j) and not otherwise.
2. Few would quarrel, we think, with the proposition that in no field of human
endeavor has the tool of language proved so inadequate in the communication
of ideas as it has in dealing with the fundamental questions of man's
predicament in life, in death or in final judgment and retribution. This fact
makes the task of discerning the intent of Congress in using the phrase
"Supreme Being" a complex one. Nor is it made the easier by the richness and
variety of spiritual life in our country. Over 250 sects inhabit our land. Some
believe in a purely personal God, some in a supernatural deity; others think of
religion as a way of life envisioning as its ultimate goal the day when all men
can live together in perfect understanding and peace. There are those who think
of God as the depth of our being; others, such as the Buddhists, strive for a
state of lasting rest through self-denial and inner purification; in Hindu
philosophy, the Supreme Being is the transcendental reality which is truth,

Robson

880

The First Amendment

knowledge and bliss. Even those religious groups which have traditionally
opposed war in every form have splintered into various denominations: from
1940 to 1947 there were four denominations using the name "Friends;” the
"Church of the Brethren" was the official name of the oldest and largest church
body of four denominations composed of those commonly called Brethren; and
the "Mennonite Church" was the largest of 17 denominations, including the
Amish and Hutterites, grouped as "Mennonite bodies" in the 1936 report on the
Census of Religious Bodies. This vast panoply of beliefs reveals the magnitude
of the problem which faced the Congress when it set about providing an
exemption from armed service. It also emphasizes the care that Congress
realized was necessary in the fashioning of an exemption which would be in
keeping with its long-established policy of not picking and choosing among
religious beliefs.
In spite of the elusive nature of the inquiry, we are not without certain
guidelines. In amending the 1940 Act, Congress adopted almost intact the
language of Chief Justice Hughes in United States v. Macintosh:
"The essence of religion is belief in a relation to God involving duties superior to
those arising from any human relation.” (Emphasis supplied.)

By comparing the statutory definition with those words, however, it becomes
readily apparent that the Congress deliberately broadened them by substituting
the phrase "Supreme Being" for the appellation "God." And in so doing it is also
significant that Congress did not elaborate on the form or nature of this higher
authority which it chose to designate as "Supreme Being." By so refraining it
must have had in mind the admonitions of the Chief Justice when he said in
the same opinion that even the word "God" had myriad meanings for men of
faith:
"[P]utting aside dogmas with their particular conceptions of deity, freedom of
conscience itself implies respect for an innate conviction of paramount duty. The
battle for religious liberty has been fought and won with respect to religious
beliefs and practices, which are not in conflict with good order, upon the very
ground of the supremacy of conscience within its proper field."

Moreover, the Senate Report on the bill specifically states that 6 (j) was
intended to re-enact "substantially the same provisions as were found" in the
1940 Act. That statute, of course, refers to "religious training and belief"
without more. Admittedly, all of the parties here purport to base their objection
on religious belief. It appears, therefore, that we need only look to this clear
statement of congressional intent as set out in the report. Under the 1940 Act it
was necessary only to have a conviction based upon religious training and
belief; we believe that is all that is required here. Within that phrase would
come all sincere religious beliefs which are based upon a power or being, or
upon a faith, to which all else is subordinate or upon which all else is
ultimately dependent. The test might be stated in these words: A sincere and
meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to
that filled by the God of those admittedly qualifying for the exemption comes
within the statutory definition. This construction avoids imputing to Congress
an intent to classify different religious beliefs, exempting some and excluding
others, and is in accord with the well-established congressional policy of equal

treatment for those whose opposition to service is grounded in their religious
tenets.
3. *** Thus the history of the Act belies the notion that it was to be restrictive
in application and available only to those believing in a traditional God. ***
Section 6 (j), then, is no more than a clarification of the 1940 provision *** [and]
continues the congressional policy of providing exemption from military service
for those whose opposition is based on grounds that can fairly be said to be
"religious." To hold otherwise would not only fly in the face of Congress' entire
action in the past; it would ignore the historic position of our country on this
issue since its founding.
4. Moreover, we believe this construction embraces the ever-broadening
understanding of the modern religious community. The eminent Protestant
theologian, Dr. Paul Tillich, whose views the Government concedes would come
within the statute, identifies God not as a projection "out there" or beyond the
skies but as the ground of our very being.*** In his book, SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY
(1957), Dr. Tillich says:
"I have written of the God above the God of theism . . . . In such a state [of selfaffirmation] the God of both religious and theological language disappears. But
something remains, namely, the seriousness of that doubt in which meaning
within meaninglessness is affirmed. The source of this affirmation of meaning
within meaninglessness, of certitude within doubt, is not the God of traditional
theism but the `God above God,' the power of being, which works through those
who have no name for it, not even the name God."

Another eminent cleric, the Bishop of Woolwich, John A. T. Robinson, in his
book, HONEST TO GOD (1963), states:
"The Bible speaks of a God `up there.' No doubt its picture of a three-decker
universe, of `the heaven above, the earth beneath and the waters under the
earth,' was once taken quite literally. . . ." "[Later] in place of a God who is
literally or physically `up there' we have accepted, as part of our mental furniture,
a God who is spiritually or metaphysically `out there.' . . . But now it seems there
is no room for him, not merely in the inn, but in the entire universe: for there
are no vacant places left. In reality, of course, our new view of the universe has
made not the slightest difference. . . ."
"But the idea of a God spiritually or metaphysically `out there' dies very much
harder. Indeed, most people would be seriously disturbed by the thought that it
should need to die at all. For it is their God, and they have nothing to put in its
place. . . . Every one of us lives with some mental picture of a God `out there,' a
God who `exists' above and beyond the world he made, a God `to' whom we pray
and to whom we `go' when we die."
"But the signs are that we are reaching the point at which the whole conception
of a God `out there,' which has served us so well since the collapse of the threedecker universe, is itself becoming more of a hindrance than a help." (Emphasis
in original.)

The Schema of the recent Ecumenical Council included a most significant
declaration on religion:

Robson

882

The First Amendment

"The community of all peoples is one. One is their origin, for God made the
entire human race live on all the face of the earth. One, too, is their ultimate end,
God. Men expect from the various religions answers to the riddles of the human
condition: What is man? What is the meaning and purpose of our lives? What is
the moral good and what is sin? What are death, judgment, and retribution after
death?
.....
"Ever since primordial days, numerous peoples have had a certain perception of
that hidden power which hovers over the course of things and over the events
that make up the lives of men; some have even come to know of a Supreme
Being and Father. Religions in an advanced culture have been able to use more
refined concepts and a more developed language in their struggle for an answer
to man's religious questions
......
"Nothing that is true and holy in these religions is scorned by the Catholic
Church. Ceaselessly the Church proclaims Christ, `the Way, the Truth, and the
Life,' in whom God reconciled all things to Himself. The Church regards with
sincere reverence those ways of action and of life, precepts and teachings which,
although they differ from the ones she sets forth, reflect nonetheless a ray of
that Truth which enlightens all men."

Dr. David Saville Muzzey, a leader in the Ethical Culture Movement, states in
his book, ETHICS AS A RELIGION (1951), that "[e]verybody except the avowed
atheists (and they are comparatively few) believes in some kind of God," and
that "The proper question to ask, therefore, is not the futile one, Do you believe
in God? but rather, What kind of God do you believe in?" Dr. Muzzey attempts
to answer that question:
"Instead of positing a personal God, whose existence man can neither prove nor
disprove, the ethical concept is founded on human experience. It is
anthropocentric, not theocentric. Religion, for all the various definitions that
have been given of it, must surely mean the devotion of man to the highest ideal
that he can conceive. And that ideal is a community of spirits in which the latent
moral potentialities of men shall have been elicited by their reciprocal endeavors
to cultivate the best in their fellow men. What ultimate reality is we do not know;
but we have the faith that it expresses itself in the human world as the power
which inspires in men moral purpose."
"Thus the `God' that we love is not the figure on the great white throne, but the
perfect pattern, envisioned by faith, of humanity as it should be, purged of the
evil elements which retard its progress toward `the knowledge, love and practice
of the right.'"

These are but a few of the views that comprise the broad spectrum of religious
beliefs found among us. But they demonstrate very clearly the diverse manners
in which beliefs, equally paramount in the lives of their possessors, may be
articulated. They further reveal the difficulties inherent in placing too narrow a
construction on the provisions of 6 (j) and thereby lend conclusive support to
the construction which we today find that Congress intended.
5. We recognize the difficulties that have always faced the trier of fact in these
cases. We hope that the test that we lay down proves less onerous. The
examiner is furnished a standard that permits consideration of criteria with
which he has had considerable experience. While the applicant's words may
Robson

883

The First Amendment

differ, the test is simple of application. It is essentially an objective one, namely,
does the claimed belief occupy the same place in the life of the objector as an
orthodox belief in God holds in the life of one clearly qualified for exemption?
Moreover, it must be remembered that in resolving these exemption problems
one deals with the beliefs of different individuals who will articulate them in a
multitude of ways. In such an intensely personal area, of course, the claim of
the registrant that his belief is an essential part of a religious faith must be
given great weight. ***
But we hasten to emphasize that while the "truth" of a belief is not open to
question, there remains the significant question whether it is "truly held." This
is the threshold question of sincerity which must be resolved in every case. It is,
of course, a question of fact - a prime consideration to the validity of every claim
for exemption as a conscientious objector. ***
APPLICATION OF 6 (j) TO THE INSTANT CASES.
As we noted earlier, the statutory definition excepts those registrants whose
beliefs are based on a "merely personal moral code." The records in these cases,
however, show that at no time did any one of the applicants suggest that his
objection was based on a "merely personal moral code." Indeed at the outset
each of them claimed in his application that his objection was based on a
religious belief. We have construed the statutory definition broadly and it
follows that any exception to it must be interpreted narrowly. The use by
Congress of the words "merely personal" seems to us to restrict the exception to
a moral code which is not only personal but which is the sole basis for the
registrant's belief and is in no way related to a Supreme Being. It follows,
therefore, that if the claimed religious beliefs of the respective registrants in
these cases meet the test that we lay down then their objections cannot be
based on a "merely personal" moral code.
In Seeger, the Court of Appeals failed to find sufficient "externally compelled
beliefs." However, it did find that "it would seem impossible to say with
assurance that [Seeger] is not bowing to `external commands' in virtually the
same sense as is the objector who defers to the will of a supernatural power."
***
The Court of Appeals also found that there was no question of the applicant's
sincerity. He was a product of a devout Roman Catholic home; he was a close
student of Quaker beliefs from which he said "much of [his] thought is derived";
he approved of their opposition to war in any form; he devoted his spare hours
to the American Friends Service Committee and was assigned to hospital duty.
In summary, Seeger professed "religious belief" and "religious faith." He did not
disavow any belief "in a relation to a Supreme Being"; indeed he stated that "the
cosmic order does, perhaps, suggest a creative intelligence." He decried the
tremendous "spiritual" price man must pay for his willingness to destroy
human life. In light of his beliefs and the unquestioned sincerity with which he
held them, we think the Board, had it applied the test we propose today, would
have granted him the exemption. We think it clear that the beliefs which
prompted his objection occupy the same place in his life as the belief in a

Robson

884

The First Amendment

traditional deity holds in the lives of his friends, the Quakers. We are reminded
once more of Dr. Tillich's thoughts:
"And if that word [God] has not much meaning for you, translate it, and speak
of the depths of your life, of the source of your being, of your ultimate concern,
of what you take seriously without any reservation. Perhaps, in order to do so,
you must forget everything traditional that you have learned about God . . . ."
Tillich, THE SHAKING OF THE FOUNDATIONS 57 (1948). (Emphasis supplied.)
It may be that Seeger did not clearly demonstrate what his beliefs were with
regard to the usual understanding of the term "Supreme Being." But as we have
said Congress did not intend that to be the test. We therefore affirm the
judgment in No. 50. ***
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE DOUGLAS, CONCURRING.
If I read the statute differently from the Court, I would have difficulties. For
then those who embraced one religious faith rather than another would be
subject to penalties; and that kind of discrimination, as we held in Sherbert v.
Verner (1963) would violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. It
would also result in a denial of equal protection by preferring some religions
over others - an invidious discrimination that would run afoul of the Due
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See Bolling v. Sharpe (1954) .
The legislative history of this Act leaves much in the dark. But it is, in my
opinion, not a tour de force if we construe the words "Supreme Being" to
include the cosmos, as well as an anthropomorphic entity. ***
The words "a Supreme Being" have no narrow technical meaning in the field of
religion. Long before the birth of our Judeo-Christian civilization the idea of God
had taken hold in many forms. Mention of only two - Hinduism and Buddhism illustrates the fluidity and evanescent scope of the concept. In the Hindu
religion the Supreme Being is conceived in the forms of several cult Deities. The
chief of these, which stand for the Hindu Triad, are Brahma, Vishnu and Siva.
Another Deity, and the one most widely worshipped, is Sakti, the Mother
Goddess, conceived as power, both destructive and creative. Though Hindu
religion encompasses the worship of many Deities, it believes in only one single
God, the eternally existent One Being with his manifold attributes and
manifestations. This idea is expressed in Rigveda, the earliest sacred text of the
Hindus, in verse 46 of a hymn attributed to the mythical seer Dirghatamas
(Rigveda, I, 164):
"They call it Indra, Mitra, Varuna and Agni And also heavenly beautiful
Garutman: The Real is One, though sages name it variously - They call it Agni,
Yama, Matarisvan."

Indian philosophy, which comprises several schools of thought, has advanced
different theories of the nature of the Supreme Being. According to the
Upanisads, Hindu sacred texts, the Supreme Being is described as the power
which creates and sustains everything, and to which the created things return
upon dissolution. The word which is commonly used in the Upanisads to

Robson

885

The First Amendment

indicate the Supreme Being is Brahman. Philosophically, the Supreme Being is
the transcendental Reality which is Truth, Knowledge, and Bliss. It is the
source of the entire universe. In this aspect Brahman is Isvara, a personal Lord
and Creator of the universe, an object of worship. But, in the view of one school
of thought, that of Sankara, even this is an imperfect and limited conception of
Brahman which must be transcended: to think of Brahman as the Creator of
the material world is necessarily to form a concept infected with illusion, or
maya - which is what the world really is, in highest truth. Ultimately, mystically,
Brahman must be understood as without attributes, as neti neti (not this, not
that).
Buddhism - whose advent marked the reform of Hinduism - continued
somewhat the same concept. As stated by Nancy Wilson Ross, "God - if I may
borrow that word for a moment - the universe, and man are one indissoluble
existence, one total whole. Only THIS - capital THIS - is. Anything and
everything that appears to us as an individual entity or phenomenon, whether it
be a planet or an atom, a mouse or a man, is but a temporary manifestation of
THIS in form; every activity that takes place, whether it be birth or death, loving
or eating breakfast, is but a temporary manifestation of THIS in activity. When
we look at things this way, naturally we cannot believe that each individual
person has been endowed with a special and individual soul or self. Each one of
us is but a cell, as it were, in the body of the Great Self, a cell that comes into
being, performs its functions, and passes away, transformed into another
manifestation. Though we have temporary individuality, that temporary, limited
individuality is not either a true self or our true self. Our true self is the Great
Self; our true body is the Body of Reality, or the Dharmakaya, to give it its
technical Buddhist name."
Does a Buddhist believe in "God" or a "Supreme Being"? That, of course,
depends on how one defines "God" ***
When the present Act was adopted in 1948 we were a nation of Buddhists,
Confucianists, and Taoists, as well as Christians. Hawaii, then a Territory, was
indeed filled with Buddhists, Buddhism being "probably the major faith, if
Protestantism and Roman Catholicism are deemed different faiths." ***
When the Congress spoke in the vague general terms of a Supreme Being I
cannot, therefore, assume that it was so parochial as to use the words in the
narrow sense urged on us. I would attribute tolerance and sophistication to the
Congress, commensurate with the religious complexion of our communities. In
sum, I agree with the Court that any person opposed to war on the basis of a
sincere belief, which in his life fills the same place as a belief in God fills in the
life of an orthodox religionist, is entitled to exemption under the statute. None
comes to us an avowedly irreligious person or as an atheist; one, as a sincere
believer in "goodness and virtue for their own sakes." His questions and doubts
on theological issues, and his wonder, are no more alien to the statutory
standard than are the awe-inspired questions of a devout Buddhist.

JUSTICE BLACK ANNOUNCED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT AND DELIVERED AN OPINION IN WHICH
JUSTICE DOUGLAS, JUSTICE BRENNAN, AND JUSTICE MARSHALL JOIN. JUSTICE HARLAN ISSUED
AN OPINION CONCURRING IN THE RESULT. JUSTICE WHITE ISSUED A DISSENTING OPINION IN WHICH
THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND JUSTICE STEWART JOINED. JUSTICE BLACKMUN TOOK NO PART IN THE
CONSIDERATION OR DECISION OF THIS CASE.

JUSTICE BLACK ANNOUNCED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT AND DELIVERED AN
OPINION IN WHICH JUSTICE DOUGLAS, JUSTICE BRENNAN, AND JUSTICE MARSHALL
JOIN.
The petitioner, Elliott Ashton Welsh II, was convicted by a United States District
Judge of refusing to submit to induction into the Armed Forces *** sentenced to
imprisonment for three years. One of petitioner's defenses to the prosecution
was that 6 (j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act exempted him
from combat and noncombat service because he was "by reason of religious
training and belief . . . conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any
form." After finding that there was no religious basis for petitioner's
conscientious objector claim, the Court of Appeals, Judge Hamley dissenting,
affirmed the conviction. We granted certiorari chiefly to review the contention
that Welsh's conviction should be set aside on the basis of this Court's decision
in United States v. Seeger (1965). For the reasons to be stated, and without
passing upon the constitutional arguments that have been raised, we vote to
reverse this conviction because of its fundamental inconsistency with United
States v. Seeger.
The controlling facts in this case are strikingly similar to those in Seeger. Both
Seeger and Welsh were brought up in religious homes and attended church in
their childhood, but in neither case was this church one which taught its
members not to engage in war at any time for any reason. Neither Seeger nor
Welsh continued his childhood religious ties into his young manhood, and
neither belonged to any religious group or adhered to the teachings of any
organized religion during the period of his involvement with the Selective
Service System. At the time of registration for the draft, neither had yet come to
accept pacifist principles. Their views on war developed only in subsequent
years, but when their ideas did fully mature both made application to their local
draft boards for conscientious objector exemptions from military service under
6 (j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act. ***
In filling out their exemption applications both Seeger and Welsh were unable
to sign the statement that, as printed in the Selective Service form, stated "I am,
by reason of my religious training and belief, conscientiously opposed to
participation in war in any form." Seeger could sign only after striking the
words "training and" and putting quotation marks around the word "religious."
Welsh could sign only after striking the words "my religious training and." On
those same applications, neither could definitely affirm or deny that he believed
in a "Supreme Being," both stating that they preferred to leave the question
open. But both Seeger and Welsh affirmed on those applications that they held
deep conscientious scruples against taking part in wars where people were
killed. Both strongly believed that killing in war was wrong, unethical, and

Robson

887

The First Amendment

immoral, and their consciences forbade them to take part in such an evil
practice. Their objection to participating in war in any form could not be said to
come from a "still, small voice of conscience"; rather, for them that voice was so
loud and insistent that both men preferred to go to jail rather than serve in the
Armed Forces. There was never any question about the sincerity and depth of
Seeger's convictions as a conscientious objector, and the same is true of Welsh.
In this regard the Court of Appeals noted, "[t]he government concedes that
[Welsh's] beliefs are held with the strength of more traditional religious
convictions." But in both cases the Selective Service System concluded that the
beliefs of these men were in some sense insufficiently "religious" to qualify them
for conscientious objector exemptions under the terms of 6 (j). *** Both Seeger
and Welsh subsequently refused to submit to induction into the military and
both were convicted of that offense.
In Seeger the Court was confronted, first, with the problem that 6 (j) defined
"religious training and belief" in terms of a "belief in a relation to a Supreme
Being . . .," a definition that arguably gave a preference to those who believed in
a conventional God as opposed to those who did not. Noting the "vast panoply
of beliefs" prevalent in our country, the Court construed the congressional
intent as being in "keeping with its long-established policy of not picking and
choosing among religious beliefs," and accordingly interpreted "the meaning of
religious training and belief so as to embrace all religions . . . ." But, having
decided that all religious conscientious objectors were entitled to the exemption,
we faced the more serious problem of determining which beliefs were "religious"
within the meaning of the statute. This question was particularly difficult in the
case of Seeger himself. Seeger stated that his was a "belief in and devotion to
goodness and virtue for their own sakes, and a religious faith in a purely ethical
creed." In a letter to his draft board, he wrote:
"My decision arises from what I believe to be considerations of validity from the
standpoint of the welfare of humanity and the preservation of the democratic
values which we in the United States are struggling to maintain. I have
concluded that war, from the practical standpoint, is futile and self-defeating
and that from the more important moral standpoint it is unethical."

On the basis of these and similar assertions, the Government argued that
Seeger's conscientious objection to war was not "religious" but stemmed from
"essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal
moral code."
In resolving the question whether Seeger and the other registrants in that case
qualified for the exemption, the Court stated that "[the] task is to decide
whether the beliefs professed by a registrant are sincerely held and whether
they are, in his own scheme of things, religious." (Emphasis added.) The
reference to the registrant's "own scheme of things" was intended to indicate
that the central consideration in determining whether the registrant's beliefs
are religious is whether these beliefs play the role of a religion and function as a
religion in the registrant's life. The Court's principal statement of its test for
determining whether a conscientious objector's beliefs are religious within the
meaning of 6 (j) was as follows:
"The test might be stated in these words: A sincere and meaningful belief which
occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of

Robson

888

The First Amendment

those admittedly qualifying for the exemption comes within the statutory
definition."

The Court made it clear that these sincere and meaningful beliefs that prompt
the registrant's objection to all wars need not be confined in either source or
content to traditional or parochial concepts of religion. ***
Accordingly, the Court found that Seeger should be granted conscientious
objector status.
In the case before us the Government seeks to distinguish our holding in Seeger
on basically two grounds, both of which were relied upon by the Court of
Appeals in affirming Welsh's conviction. First, it is stressed that Welsh was far
more insistent and explicit than Seeger in denying that his views were religious.
For example, in filling out their conscientious objector applications, Seeger put
quotation marks around the word "religious," but Welsh struck the word
"religious" entirely and later characterized his beliefs as having been formed "by
reading in the fields of history and sociology." The Court of Appeals found that
Welsh had "denied that his objection to war was premised on religious belief"
and concluded that "[t]he Appeal Board was entitled to take him at his word."
We think this attempt to distinguish Seeger fails for the reason that it places
undue emphasis on the registrant's interpretation of his own beliefs. The
Court's statement in Seeger that a registrant's characterization of his own belief
as "religious" should carry great weight, does not imply that his declaration that
his views are nonreligious should be treated similarly. When a registrant states
that his objections to war are "religious," that information is highly relevant to
the question of the function his beliefs have in his life. But very few registrants
are fully aware of the broad scope of the word "religious" as used in 6 (j), and
accordingly a registrant's statement that his beliefs are nonreligious is a highly
unreliable guide for those charged with administering the exemption. Welsh
himself presents a case in point. Although he originally characterized his beliefs
as nonreligious, he later upon reflection wrote a long and thoughtful letter to
his Appeal Board in which he declared that his beliefs were "certainly religious
in the ethical sense of the word." He explained:
"I believe I mentioned taking of life as not being, for me, a religious wrong. Again,
I assumed Mr. [Brady (the Department of Justice hearing officer)] was using the
word `religious' in the conventional sense, and, in order to be perfectly honest
did not characterize my belief as `religious.'"

The Government also seeks to distinguish Seeger on the ground that Welsh's
views, unlike Seeger's were "essentially political, sociological, or philosophical
views or a merely personal moral code." As previously noted, the Government
made the same argument about Seeger, and not without reason, for Seeger's
views had a substantial political dimension. In this case, Welsh's conscientious
objection to war was undeniably based in part on his perception of world
politics. In a letter to his local board, he wrote:
"I can only act according to what I am and what I see. And I see that the military
complex wastes both human and material resources, that it fosters disregard for
(what I consider a paramount concern) human needs and ends; I see that the
means we employ to `defend' our `way of life' profoundly change that way of life.
I see that in our failure to recognize the political, social, and economic realities
of the world, we, as a nation, fail our responsibility as a nation."

Robson

889

The First Amendment

We certainly do not think that 6 (j)'s exclusion of those persons with "essentially
political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code"
should be read to exclude those who hold strong beliefs about our domestic and
foreign affairs or even those whose conscientious objection to participation in all
wars is founded to a substantial extent upon considerations of public policy.
The two groups of registrants that obviously do fall within these exclusions from
the exemption are those whose beliefs are not deeply held and those whose
objection to war does not rest at all upon moral, ethical, or religious principle
but instead rests solely upon considerations of policy, pragmatism, or
expediency. In applying 6 (j)'s exclusion of those whose views are "essentially
political, sociological, or philosophical" or of those who have a "merely personal
moral code," it should be remembered that these exclusions are definitional and
do not therefore restrict the category of persons who are conscientious objectors
by "religious training and belief." Once the Selective service System has taken
the first step and determined under the standards set out here and in Seeger
that the registrant is a "religious" conscientious objector, it follows that his
views cannot be "essentially political, sociological, or philosophical." Nor can
they be a "merely personal moral code."
Welsh stated that he "believe[d] the taking of life - anyone's life - to be morally
wrong." In his original conscientious objector application he wrote the following:
"I believe that human life is valuable in and of itself; in its living; therefore I will
not injure or kill another human being. This belief (and the corresponding `duty'
to abstain from violence toward another person) is not `superior to those arising
from any human relation.' On the contrary: it is essential to every human
relation. I cannot, therefore, conscientiously comply with the Government's
insistence that I assume duties which I feel are immoral and totally repugnant."

Welsh elaborated his beliefs in later communications with Selective Service
officials. On the basis of these beliefs and the conclusion of the Court of
Appeals that he held them "with the strength of more traditional religious
convictions," we think Welsh was clearly entitled to a conscientious objector
exemption. Section 6 (j) requires no more. That section exempts from military
service all those whose consciences, spurred by deeply held moral, ethical, or
religious beliefs, would give them no rest or peace if they allowed themselves to
become a part of an instrument of war.
The judgment is
Reversed.
JUSTICE HARLAN, CONCURRING IN THE RESULT.
Candor requires me to say that I joined the Court's opinion in United States v.
Seeger (1965), only with the gravest misgivings as to whether it was a legitimate
exercise in statutory construction, and today's decision convinces me that in
doing so I made a mistake which I should now acknowledge.
*** In my opinion, the liberties taken with the statute both in Seeger and
today's decision cannot be justified in the name of the familiar doctrine of
construing federal statutes in a manner that will avoid possible constitutional
Robson

890

The First Amendment

infirmities in them. There are limits to the permissible application of that
doctrine, and, as I will undertake to show in this opinion, those limits were
crossed in Seeger, and even more apparently have been exceeded in the present
case. I therefore find myself unable to escape facing the constitutional issue
that this case squarely presents: whether 6 (j) in limiting this draft exemption to
those opposed to war in general because of theistic beliefs runs afoul of the
religious clauses of the First Amendment. For reasons later appearing I believe
it does, and on that basis I concur in the judgment reversing this conviction,
and adopt the test announced by JUSTICE BLACK, not as a matter of statutory
construction, but as the touchstone for salvaging a congressional policy of long
standing that would otherwise have to be nullified.
I
*** It is Congress' will that must here be divined. In that endeavor it is one thing
to give words a meaning not necessarily envisioned by Congress so as to adapt
them to circumstances also uncontemplated by the legislature in order to
achieve the legislative policy, Holy Trinity Church v. United States (1892); it is a
wholly different matter to define words so as to change policy. The limits of this
Court's mandate to stretch concededly elastic congressional language are fixed
in all cases by the context of its usage and legislative history, if available, that
are the best guides to congressional purpose and the lengths to which Congress
enacted a policy. The prevailing opinion today snubs both guidelines for it is
apparent from a textual analysis of 6 (j) and the legislative history that the
words of this section, as used and understood by Congress, fall short of
enacting the broad policy of exempting from military service all individuals who
in good faith oppose all war.
A
The natural reading of 6 (j), which quite evidently draws a distinction between
theistic and nontheistic religions, is the only one that is consistent with the
legislative history. ***
B
Against this legislative history it is a remarkable feat of judicial surgery to
remove, as did Seeger, the theistic requirement of 6 (j). The prevailing opinion
today, however, in the name of interpreting the will of Congress, has performed
a lobotomy and completely transformed the statute by reading out of it any
distinction between religiously acquired beliefs and those deriving from
"essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal
moral code."
In the realm of statutory construction it is appropriate to search for meaning in
the congressional vocabulary in a lexicon most probably consulted by Congress.
Resort to WEBSTER'S reveals that the meanings of "religion" are: "1. The service
and adoration of God or a god as expressed in forms of worship, in obedience to
divine commands . . .; 2. The state of life of a religious . . .; 3. One of the
systems of faith and worship; a form of theism; a religious faith . . .; 4. The
profession or practice of religious beliefs; religious observances collectively; pl.
rites; 5. Devotion or fidelity; . . . conscientiousness; 6. An apprehension,
awareness, or conviction of the existence of a supreme being, or more widely, of
supernatural powers or influences controlling one's own, humanity's, or
nature's destiny; also, such an apprehension, etc., accompanied by or arousing

Robson

891

The First Amendment

reverence, love, gratitude, the will to obey and serve, and the like . . . ."
(Emphasis added.)
Of the five pertinent definitions four include the notion of either a Supreme
Being or a cohesive, organized group pursuing a common spiritual purpose
together. While, as the Court's opinion in Seeger points out, these definitions do
not exhaust the almost infinite and sophisticated possibilities for defining
"religion," there is strong evidence that Congress restricted, in this instance, the
word to its conventional sense. That it is difficult to plot the semantic
penumbra of the word "religion" does not render this term so plastic in meaning
that the Court is entitled, as matter of statutory construction, to conclude that
any asserted and strongly held belief satisfies its requirements. It must be
recognized that the permissible shadow of connotation is limited by the context
in which words are used. In 6 (j) Congress has included not only a reference to
a Supreme Being but has also explicitly contrasted "religious" beliefs with those
that are "essentially political, sociological, or philosophical" and a "personal
moral code." This exception certainly is, at the very least, the statutory
boundary, the "asymptote," of the word "religion."
For me this dichotomy reveals that Congress was not embracing that definition
of religion that alone speaks in terms of "devotion or fidelity" to individual
principles acquired on an individualized basis but was adopting, at least, those
meanings that associate religion with formal, organized worship or shared
beliefs by a recognizable and cohesive group. Indeed, this requirement was
explicit in the predecessor to the 1940 statute. ***
Unless we are to assume an Alice-in-Wonderland world where words have no
meaning, I think it fair to say that Congress' choice of language cannot fail to
convey to the discerning reader the very policy choice that the prevailing
opinion today completely obliterates: that between conventional religions that
usually have an organized and formal structure and dogma and a cohesive
group identity, even when nontheistic, and cults that represent schools of
thought and in the usual case are without formal structure or are, at most,
loose and informal associations of individuals who share common ethical,
moral, or intellectual views.
II
When the plain thrust of a legislative enactment can only be circumvented by
distortion to avert an inevitable constitutional collision, it is only by exalting
form over substance that one can justify this veering off the path that has been
plainly marked by the statute. Such a course betrays extreme skepticism as to
constitutionality, and, in this instance, reflects a groping to preserve the
conscientious objector exemption at all cost.
I cannot subscribe to a wholly emasculated construction of a statute to avoid
facing a latent constitutional question, in purported fidelity to the salutary
doctrine of avoiding unnecessary resolution of constitutional issues, a principle
to which I fully adhere. See Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority (1936)
(Brandeis, J., concurring). It is, of course, desirable to salvage by construction
legislative enactments whenever there is good reason to believe that Congress
did not intend to legislate consequences that are unconstitutional, but it is not
permissible, in my judgment, to take a lateral step that robs legislation of all

Robson

892

The First Amendment

meaning in order to avert the collision between its plainly intended purpose and
the commands of the Constitution. ***
I therefore turn to the constitutional question.
III
The constitutional question that must be faced in this case is whether a statute
that defers to the individual's conscience only when his views emanate from
adherence to theistic religious beliefs is within the power of Congress. Congress,
of course, could, entirely consistently with the requirements of the Constitution,
eliminate all exemptions for conscientious objectors. Such a course would be
wholly "neutral" and, in my view, would not offend the Free Exercise Clause, for
reasons set forth in my dissenting opinion in Sherbert v. Verner (1963).
However, having chosen to exempt, it cannot draw the line between theistic or
nontheistic religious beliefs on the one hand and secular beliefs on the other.
Any such distinctions are not, in my view, compatible with the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment. The implementation of the neutrality principle
of these cases requires, in my view, as I stated in Walz v. Tax Comm'n "an equal
protection mode of analysis. The Court must survey meticulously the
circumstances of governmental categories to eliminate, as it were, religious
gerrymanders. In any particular case the critical question is whether the scope
of legislation encircles a class so broad that it can be fairly concluded that [all
groups that] could be thought to fall within the natural perimeter [are
included]."
The "radius" of this legislation is the conscientiousness with which an
individual opposes war in general, yet the statute, as I think it must be
construed, excludes from its "scope" individuals motivated by teachings of
nontheistic religions, and individuals guided by an inner ethical voice that
bespeaks secular and not "religious" reflection. It not only accords a preference
to the "religious" but also disadvantages adherents of religions that do not
worship a Supreme Being. The constitutional infirmity cannot be cured,
moreover, even by an impermissible construction that eliminates the theistic
requirement and simply draws the line between religious and nonreligious. This
in my view offends the Establishment Clause and is that kind of classification
that this Court has condemned.
If the exemption is to be given application, it must encompass the class of
individuals it purports to exclude, those whose beliefs emanate from a purely
moral, ethical, or philosophical source. The common denominator must be the
intensity of moral conviction with which a belief is held. Common experience
teaches that among "religious" individuals some are weak and others strong
adherents to tenets and this is no less true of individuals whose lives are guided
by personal ethical considerations. ***
IV
Where a statute is defective because of underinclusion there exist two remedial
alternatives: a court may either declare it a nullity and order that its benefits
not extend to the class that the legislature intended to benefit, or it may extend
the coverage of the statute to include those who are aggrieved by exclusion.
The appropriate disposition of this case, which is a prosecution for refusing to
submit to induction and not an action for a declaratory judgment on the

Robson

893

The First Amendment

constitutionality of 6 (j), is determined by the fact that at the time of Welsh's
induction notice and prosecution the Selective Service was, as required by
statute, exempting individuals whose beliefs were identical in all respects to
those held by petitioner except that they derived from a religious source. Since
this created a religious benefit not accorded to petitioner, it is clear to me that
this conviction must be reversed under the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment unless Welsh is to go remediless.
This result, while tantamount to extending the statute, is not only the one
mandated by the Constitution in this case but also the approach I would take
had this question been presented in an action for a declaratory judgment or "an
action in equity where the enforcement of a statute awaits the final
determination of the court as to validity and scope." While the necessary
remedial operation, extension, is more analogous to a graft than amputation, I
think the boundaries of permissible choice may properly be considered fixed by
the legislative pronouncement on severability. ***
The policy of exempting religious conscientious objectors is one of longstanding
tradition in this country and accords recognition to what is, in a diverse and
"open" society, the important value of reconciling individuality of belief with
practical exigencies whenever possible. It dates back to colonial times and has
been perpetuated in state and federal conscription statutes. That it has been
phrased in religious terms reflects, I assume, the fact that ethics and morals,
while the concern of secular philosophy, have traditionally been matters taught
by organized religion and that for most individuals spiritual and ethical
nourishment is derived from that source. It further reflects, I would suppose,
the assumption that beliefs emanating from a religious source are probably held
with great intensity.
When a policy has roots so deeply embedded in history, there is a compelling
reason for a court to hazard the necessary statutory repairs if they can be made
within the administrative framework of the statute and without impairing other
legislative goals, even though they entail, not simply eliminating an offending
section, but rather building upon it. Thus I am prepared to accept the
prevailing opinion's conscientious objector test, not as a reflection of
congressional statutory intent but as patchwork of judicial making that cures
the defect of under-inclusion in 6 (j) and can be administered by local boards in
the usual course of business. Like the prevailing opinion, I also conclude that
petitioner's beliefs are held with the required intensity and consequently vote to
reverse the judgment of conviction.
JUSTICE WHITE, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND JUSTICE STEWART JOIN,
DISSENTING.
Whether or not United States v. Seeger (1965), accurately reflected the intent of
Congress in providing draft exemptions for religious conscientious objectors to
war, I cannot join today's construction of 6 (j) extending draft exemption to
those who disclaim religious objections to war and whose views about war
represent a purely personal code arising not from religious training and belief
as the statute requires but from readings in philosophy, history, and sociology.
Our obligation in statutory construction cases is to enforce the will of Congress,

Robson

894

The First Amendment

not our own; and as Justice Harlan has demonstrated, construing 6 (j) to
include Welsh exempts from the draft a class of persons to whom Congress has
expressly denied an exemption.
For me that conclusion should end this case. Even if Welsh is quite right in
asserting that exempting religious believers is an establishment of religion
forbidden by the First Amendment, he nevertheless remains one of those
persons whom Congress took pains not to relieve from military duty. Whether
or not 6 (j) is constitutional, Welsh had no First Amendment excuse for refusing
to report for induction. If it is contrary to the express will of Congress to exempt
Welsh, as I think it is, then there is no warrant for saving the religious
exemption and the statute by redrafting it in this Court to include Welsh and all
others like him.
*** Nothing in the First Amendment prohibits drafting Welsh and other
nonreligious objectors to war. Saving 6 (j) by extending it to include Welsh
cannot be done in the name of a presumed congressional will but only by the
Court's taking upon itself the power to make draft-exemption policy.
If I am wrong in thinking that Welsh cannot benefit from invalidation of 6 (j) on
Establishment Clause grounds, I would nevertheless affirm his conviction; for I
cannot hold that Congress violated the Clause in exempting from the draft all
those who oppose war by reason of religious training and belief. In exempting
religious conscientious objectors, Congress was making one of two judgments,
perhaps both. First, 6 (j) may represent a purely practical judgment that
religious objectors, however admirable, would be of no more use in combat than
many others unqualified for military service. Exemption was not extended to
them to further religious belief or practice but to limit military service to those
who were prepared to undertake the fighting that the armed services have to do.
On this basis, the exemption has neither the primary purpose nor the effect of
furthering religion. ***
We have said that neither support nor hostility, but neutrality, is the goal of the
religion clauses of the First Amendment. "Neutrality," however, is not selfdefining. If it is "favoritism" and not "neutrality" to exempt religious believers
from the draft, is it "neutrality" and not "inhibition" of religion to compel
religious believers to fight when they have special reasons for not doing so,
reasons to which the Constitution gives particular recognition? It cannot be
ignored that the First Amendment itself contains a religious classification. The
Amendment protects belief and speech, but as a general proposition, the free
speech provisions stop short of immunizing conduct from official regulation.
The Free Exercise Clause, however, has a deeper cut: it protects conduct as well
as religious belief and speech. "[I]t safeguards the free exercise of the chosen
form of religion. Thus the Amendment embraces two concepts, - freedom to
believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the
second cannot be." Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940). Although socially harmful
acts may as a rule be banned despite the Free Exercise Clause even where
religiously motivated, there is an area of conduct that cannot be forbidden to
religious practitioners but that may be forbidden to others. We should thus not
labor to find a violation of the Establishment Clause when free exercise values
prompt Congress to relieve religious believers from the burdens of the law at

Robson

895

The First Amendment

least in those instances where the law is not merely prohibitory but commands
the performance of military duties that are forbidden by a man's religion.***
I would affirm the judgment below.

Notes	  
1.
Note the difference between Seeger and Welsh regarding the
relationships between statutory construction and the constitutional issue.
2.
What do you think of Justice Harlan’s concurrence in the
judgment in Welsh? Without this, the Court would have been evenly
divided, resulting in an affirmation of Welsh’s conviction.
3.
Is the dictionary definition - - - or definitions - - - helpful when
considering the meaning of “religion”?
4.
The definition of “religion” raises the question whether protection
for the same acts should vary depending upon their motivation. Both
Seeger and Welsh wanted an exemption from the draft, clearly based on
their beliefs, but the “result” - - - not having to serve in the military - - would be the same.
This difference is more clearly illustrated by the more recent cases of two
teenagers, Danielle Bar-Navon and Ariana Iacono, who each wore facial
jewelry to their respective schools. Both violated the school’s dress code,
both were disciplined, and both brought actions under the First
Amendment.
Danielle Bar-Navon argued that her facial jewelry was expressive speech,
conveying a message of nonconformity. Ariana Iacono contended that her
facial jewelry was appropriate because she was a member of the Church
of Body Modification.
Danielle Bar-Navon’s claim under the First Amendment speech clause
was rejected. In Bar-Navon v. Brevard County Sch. Bd., 290 F. App'x 273,
275 (11th Cir. 2008), the Eleventh Circuit stated that even if Danielle’s
jewelry had satisfied the speech threshold, the school restriction would
merely be subject to intermediate scrutiny, a standard the prohibition
easily survived. The court noted that the dress code allowed Danielle
adequate alternative methods of communication: she could communicate
by talking, by engaging in “active debate,” or by wearing “symbolic
jewelry through ear piercings.” Moreover, the school policy did not
prohibit piercings, it only prohibited “wearing jewelry through piercings,”
and it only applied while she was at school. Thus, Danielle Bar-Navon
had no First Amendment right to wear her facial jewelry to high school.

Robson

896

The First Amendment

In contrast, a federal judge accepted Ariana Iacono’s claim under the
First Amendment Free Exercise Clause. In granting a motion for a
temporary restraining order in Iacono v. Croom, 5:10-CV-416-H, 2010 WL
3984601 (E.D.N.C. Oct. 8, 2010), the judge described the Church of Body
Modification as having approximately 3,500 members in the United
States who “practice ancient and modern body modification ritualsincluding piercing, scarring, tattooing, and suspensions-through which
they strengthen the connection between their bodies, minds, and souls.”
The judge noted that Ariana had joined the church the month that
school had started, had her nose pierced, and now believed, “according
to the Church’s teachings, she must wear the nose stud at all times.”
With no analysis, the judge found that Ariana Iacono was likely to prevail
on the free exercise of religion claim, and therefore restrained the school
authorities from enforcing the dress code against Ariana as it pertained
to her nose stud.
If you were advising Danielle Bar-Navon, in light of Seeger and Welsh,
how might you counsel her?
5.
The word “religion” appears in the First Amendment’s Religion
Clauses only once:
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the
government for a redress of grievances.

However, should it have the same meaning in both Clauses? One
argument is that the marginal cases should be resolved differently. Most
famously advanced by Laurence Tribe, this contention is that:
“All that is arguably religious should be considered religious for free exercise
analysis; anything arguably non-religious should not be considered religious in
applying the establishment clause.”

LAURENCE H. TRIBE, AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 826-28 (1st ed. 1978).
Is this approach viable? Preferable? Actually followed in the marginal
cases?

JUSTICE BLACK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT IN WHICH VINSON, C.J., AND REED,
DOUGLAS, AND MURPHY, J.J. JOINED. JACKSON, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION IN WHICH
FRANKFURTER, J., JOINED. RUTLEDGE, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION IN WHICH FRANKFURTER,
JACKSON, BURTON, J.J., JOINED.

JUSTICE BLACK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
A New Jersey statute authorizes its local school districts to make rules and
contracts for the transportation of children to and from schools. The appellee, a
township board of education, acting pursuant to this statute authorized
reimbursement to parents of money expended by them for the bus
transportation of their children on regular busses operated by the public
transportation system. Part of this money was for the payment of transportation
of some children in the community to Catholic parochial schools. These church
schools give their students, in addition to secular education, regular religious
instruction conforming to the religious tenets and modes of worship of the
Catholic Faith. The superintendent of these schools is a Catholic priest.
The appellant, in his capacity as a district taxpayer, filed suit in a State court
challenging the right of the Board to reimburse parents of parochial school
students. He contended that the statute and the resolution passed pursuant to
it violated both the State and the Federal Constitutions. That court held that
the legislature was without power to authorize such payment under the State
constitution. The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals reversed, holding
that neither the statute nor the resolution passed pursuant to it was in conflict
with the State constitution or the provisions of the Federal Constitution in issue.
The case is here on appeal.
*** [“we put to one side the question as to the validity of the statute against the
claim that it does not authorize payment for the transportation generally of
school children in New Jersey.”] The only contention here is that the State
statute and the resolution, in so far as they authorized reimbursement to
parents of children attending parochial schools, violate the Federal Constitution
in these two respects, which to some extent, overlap. First. They authorize the
State to take by taxation the private property of some and bestow it upon others,
to be used for their own private purposes. This, it is alleged violates the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Second. The statute and the
resolution forced inhabitants to pay taxes to help support and maintain schools
which are dedicated to, and which regularly teach, the Catholic Faith. This is
alleged to be a use of State power to support church schools contrary to the
prohibition of the First Amendment which the Fourteenth Amendment made
applicable to the states.
First. The due process argument that the State law taxes some people to help
others carry out their private purposes *** [is rejected].

Robson

899

The First Amendment

Second. The New Jersey statute is challenged as a 'law respecting an
establishment of religion.' The First Amendment, as made applicable to the
states by the Fourteenth, Murdock v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (1943),
commands that a state 'shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' These words of the First
Amendment reflected in the minds of early Americans a vivid mental picture of
conditions and practices which they fervently wished to stamp out in order to
preserve liberty for themselves and for their posterity. Doubtless their goal has
not been entirely reached; but so far has the Nation moved toward it that the
expression 'law respecting an establishment of religion,' probably does not so
vividly remind present-day Americans of the evils, fears, and political problems
that caused that expression to be written into our Bill of Rights. Whether this
New Jersey law is one respecting the 'establishment of religion' requires an
understanding of the meaning of that language, particularly with respect to the
imposition of taxes. Once again, therefore, it is not inappropriate briefly to
review the background and environment of the period in which that
constitutional language was fashioned and adopted.
A large proportion of the early settlers of this country came here from Europe to
escape the bondage of laws which compelled them to support and attend
government favored churches. The centuries immediately before and
contemporaneous with the colonization of America had been filled with turmoil,
civil strife, and persecutions, generated in large part by established sects
determined to maintain their absolute political and religious supremacy. With
the power of government supporting them, at various times and places,
Catholics had persecuted Protestants, Protestants had persecuted Catholics,
Protestant sects had persecuted other Protestant sects, Catholics of one shade
of belief had persecuted Catholics of another shade of belief, and all of these
had from time to time persecuted Jews. In efforts to force loyalty to whatever
religious group happened to be on top and in league with the government of a
particular time and place, men and women had been fined, cast in jail, cruelly
tortured, and killed. Among the offenses for which these punishments had been
inflicted were such things as speaking disrespectfully of the views of ministers
of government-established churches, nonattendance at those churches,
expressions of non-belief in their doctrines, and failure to pay taxes and tithes
to support them.
These practices of the old world were transplanted to and began to thrive in the
soil of the new America. The very charters granted by the English Crown to the
individuals and companies designated to make the laws which would control
the destinies of the colonials authorized these individuals and companies to
erect religious establishments which all, whether believers or non-believers,
would be required to support and attend. An exercise of this authority was
accompanied by a repetition of many of the old world practices and
persecutions. Catholics found themselves hounded and proscribed because of
their faith; Quakers who followed their conscience went to jail; Baptists were
peculiarly obnoxious to certain dominant Protestant sects; men and women of
varied faiths who happened to be in a minority in a particular locality were
persecuted because they steadfastly persisted in worshipping God only as their
own consciences dictated. And all of these dissenters were compelled to pay
tithes and taxes to support government-sponsored churches whose ministers

Robson

900

The First Amendment

preached inflammatory sermons designed to strengthen and consolidate the
established faith by generating a burning hatred against dissenters. These
practices became so commonplace as to shock the freedom-loving colonials into
a feeling of abhorrence. The imposition of taxes to pay ministers' salaries and
to build and maintain churches and church property aroused their indignation.
It was these feelings which found expression in the First Amendment. No one
locality and no one group throughout the Colonies can rightly be given entire
credit for having aroused the sentiment that culminated in adoption of the Bill
of Rights' provisions embracing religious liberty. But Virginia, where the
established church had achieved a dominant influence in political affairs and
where many excesses attracted wide public attention, provided a great stimulus
and able leadership for the movement. The people there, as elsewhere, reached
the conviction that individual religious liberty could be achieved best under a
government which was stripped of all power to tax, to support, or otherwise to
assist any or all religions, or to interfere with the beliefs of any religious
individual or group.
The movement toward this end reached its dramatic climax in Virginia in 178586 when the Virginia legislative body was about to renew Virginia's tax levy for
the support of the established church. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison
led the fight against this tax. Madison wrote his great Memorial and
Remonstrance against the law. In it, he eloquently argued that a true religion
did not need the support of law; that no person, either believer or non-believer,
should be taxed to support a religious institution of any kind; that the best
interest of a society required that the minds of men always be wholly free; and
that cruel persecutions were the inevitable result of government-established
religions. Madison's Remonstrance received strong support throughout Virginia,
and the Assembly postponed consideration of the proposed tax measure until
its next session. When the proposal came up for consideration at that session,
it not only died in committee, but the Assembly enacted the famous 'Virginia
Bill for Religious Liberty' originally written by Thomas Jefferson. The preamble
to that Bill stated among other things that
'Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by
temporal punishments, or burthens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to
beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of
the Holy author of our religion who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose
not to propagate it by coercions on either . . .; that to compel a man to furnish
contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is
sinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of
his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving
his contributions to the particular pastor, whose morals he would make his
pattern ...'

And the statute itself enacted
'That no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship,
place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or
burthened, in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his
religious opinions or belief. . . .'

This Court has previously recognized that the provisions of the First
Amendment, in the drafting and adoption of which Madison and Jefferson

Robson

901

The First Amendment

played such leading roles, had the same objective and were intended to provide
the same protection against governmental intrusion on religious liberty as the
Virginia statute. Prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the First
Amendment did not apply as a restraint against the states. Most of them did
soon provide similar constitutional protections for religious liberty. But some
states persisted for about half a century in imposing restraints upon the free
exercise of religion and in discriminating against particular religious groups. In
recent years, so far as the provision against the establishment of a religion is
concerned, the question has most frequently arisen in connection with
proposed state aid to church schools and efforts to carry on religious teachings
in the public schools in accordance with the tenets of a particular sect. Some
churches have either sought or accepted state financial support for their
schools. Here again the efforts to obtain state aid or acceptance of it have not
been limited to any one particular faith. The state courts, in the main, have
remained faithful to the language of their own constitutional provisions
designed to protect religious freedom and to separate religious and governments.
Their decisions, however, show the difficulty in drawing the line between tax
legislation which provides funds for the welfare of the general public and that
which is designed to support institutions which teach religion.
*** The 'establishment of religion' clause of the First Amendment means at least
this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither
can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over
another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away
from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any
religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious
beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in any
amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or
institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever from they may adopt to
teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can,
openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or
groups and vice versa. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against
establishment of religion by law was intended to erect 'a wall of separation
between Church and State.'
We must consider the New Jersey statute in accordance with the foregoing
limitations imposed by the First Amendment. *** New Jersey cannot
consistently with the 'establishment of religion' clause of the First Amendment
contribute tax-raised funds to the support of an institution which teaches the
tenets and faith of any church. On the other hand, other language of the
amendment commands that New Jersey cannot hamper its citizens in the free
exercise of their own religion. Consequently, it cannot exclude individual
Catholics, Lutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Nonbelievers, Presbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of their
faith, or lack of it, from receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation. While
we do not mean to intimate that a state could not provide transportation only to
children attending public schools, we must be careful, in protecting the citizens
of New Jersey against state-established churches, to be sure that we do not
inadvertently prohibit New Jersey from extending its general State law benefits
to all its citizens without regard to their religious belief. Measured by these
standards, we cannot say that the First Amendment prohibits New Jersey from

Robson

902

The First Amendment

spending taxraised funds to pay the bus fares of parochial school pupils as a
part of a general program under which it pays the fares of pupils attending
public and other schools. It is undoubtedly true that children are helped to get
to church schools. There is even a possibility that some of the children might
not be sent to the church schools if the parents were compelled to pay their
children's bus fares out of their own pockets when transportation to a public
school would have been paid for by the State. The same possibility exists where
the state requires a local transit company to provide reduced fares to school
children including those attending parochial schools, or where a municipally
owned transportation system undertakes to carry all school children free of
charge. Moreover, state-paid policemen, detailed to protect children going to
and from church schools from the very real hazards of traffic, would serve
much the same purpose and accomplish much the same result as state
provisions intended to guarantee free transportation of a kind which the state
deems to be best for the school children's welfare. And parents might refuse to
risk their children to the serious danger of traffic accidents going to and from
parochial schools, the approaches to which were not protected by policemen.
Similarly, parents might be reluctant to permit their children to attend schools
which the state had cut off from such general government services as ordinary
police and fire protection, connections for sewage disposal, public highways and
sidewalks. Of course, cutting off church schools from these services, so
separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function, would
make it far more difficult for the schools to operate. But such is obviously not
the purpose of the First Amendment. That Amendment requires the state to be
a neutral in its relations with groups of religious believers and non-believers; it
does not require the state to be their adversary. State power is no more to be
used so as to handicap religions, than it is to favor them.
This Court has said that parents may, in the discharge of their duty under state
compulsory education laws, send their children to a religious rather than a
public school if the school meets the secular educational requirements which
the state has power to impose. See Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925). It appears
that these parochial schools meet New Jersey's requirements. The State
contributes no money to the schools. It does not support them. Its legislation,
as applied, does no more than provide a general program to help parents get
their children, regardless of their religion, safely and expeditiously to and from
accredited schools.
The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state. That wall
must be kept high and impregnable. We could not approve the slightest breach.
New Jersey has not breached it here.
AFFIRMED.
JUSTICE JACKSON, DISSENTING, JOINED BY JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.
I find myself, contrary to first impressions, unable to join in this decision. I
have a sympathy, though it is not ideological, with Catholic citizens who are
compelled by law to pay taxes for public schools, and also feel constrained by
conscience and discipline to support other schools for their own children. Such
relief to them as this case involves is not in itself a serious burden to taxpayers

Robson

903

The First Amendment

and I had assumed it to be as little serious in principle. Study of this case
convinces me otherwise. The Court's opinion marshals every argument in favor
of state aid and puts the case in its most favorable light, but much of its
reasoning confirms my conclusions that there are no good grounds upon which
to support the present legislation. In fact, the undertones of the opinion,
advocating complete and uncompromising separation of Church from State,
seem utterly discordant with its conclusion yielding support to their
commingling in educational matters. The case which irresistibly comes to mind
as the most fitting precedent is that of Julia who, according to Byron's reports,
'whispering 'I will ne'er consent,'- consented.'

II.
Whether the taxpayer constitutionally can be made to contribute aid to parents
of students because of their attendance at parochial schools depends upon the
nature of those schools and their relation to the Church. The Constitution says
nothing of education. It lays no obligation on the states to provide schools and
does not undertake to regulate state systems of education if they see fit to
maintain them. But they cannot, through school policy any more than through
other means, invade rights secured to citizens by the Constitution of the United
States. West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette. One of our basic
rights is to be free of taxation to support a transgression of the constitutional
command that the authorities 'shall make no law respecting an establishment
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' U.S.Const., Amend. I.
The function of the Church school is a subject on which this record is meager.
It shows only that the schools are under superintendence of a priest and that
'religion is taught as part of the curriculum.' But we know that such schools are
parochial only in name-they, in fact, represent a worldwide and age-old policy of
the Roman Catholic Church. ***
It is no exaggeration to say that the whole historic conflict in temporal policy
between the Catholic Church and non-Catholics comes to a focus in their
respective school policies. The Roman Catholic Church, counseled by
experience in many ages and many lands and with all sorts and conditions of
men, takes what, from the viewpoint of its own progress and the success of its
mission, is a wise estimate of the importance of education to religion. It does
not leave the individual to pick up religion by chance. It relies on early and
indelible indoctrination in the faith and order of the Church by the word and
example of persons consecrated to the task.
Our public school, if not a product of Protestantism, at least is more consistent
with it than with the Catholic culture and scheme of values. It is a relatively
recent development dating from about 1840. It is organized on the premise that
secular education can be isolated from all religious teaching so that the school
can inculcate all needed temporal knowledge and also maintain a strict and
lofty neutrality as to religion. The assumption is that after the individual has
been instructed in worldly wisdom he will be better fitted to choose his religion.
Whether such a disjunction is possible, and if possible whether it is wise, are
questions I need not try to answer.

The First Amendment

I should be surprised if any Catholic would deny that the parochial school is a
vital, if not the most vital, part of the Roman Catholic Church. If put to the
choice, that venerable institution, I should expect, would forego its whole
service for mature persons before it would give up education of the young, and
it would be a wise choice. Its growth and cohesion, discipline and loyalty, spring
from its schools. Catholic education is the rock on which the whole structure
rests, and to render tax aid to its Church school is indistinguishable to me from
rendering the same aid to the Church itself.
III.
It is of no importance in this situation whether the beneficiary of this
expenditure of tax-raised funds is primarily the parochial school and
incidentally the pupil, or whether the aid is directly bestowed on the pupil with
indirect benefits to the school. The state cannot maintain a Church and it can
no more tax its citizens to furnish free carriage to those who attend a Church.
The prohibition against establishment of religion cannot be circumvented by a
subsidy, bonus or reimbursement of expense to individuals for receiving
religious instruction and indoctrination.
*** It seems to me that the basic fallacy in the Court's reasoning, which
accounts for its failure to apply the principles it avows, is in ignoring the
essentially religious test by which beneficiaries of this expenditure are selected.
A policeman protects a Catholic, of course-but not because he is a Catholic; it is
because he is a man and a member of our society. The fireman protects the
Church school-but not because it is a Church school; it is because it is property,
part of the assets of our society. Neither the fireman nor the policeman has to
ask before he renders aid 'Is this man or building identified with the Catholic
Church.' But before these school authorities draw a check to reimburse for a
student's fare they must ask just that question, and if the school is a Catholic
one they may render aid because it is such, while if it is of any other faith or is
run for profit, the help must be withheld. To consider the converse of the
Court's reasoning will best disclose its fallacy. That there is no parallel between
police and fire protection and this plan of reimbursement is apparent from the
incongruity of the limitation of this Act if applied to police and fire service.
Could we sustain an Act that said police shall protect pupils on the way to or
from public schools and Catholic schools but not while going to and coming
from other schools, and firemen shall extinguish a blaze in public or Catholic
school buildings but shall not put out a blaze in Protestant Church schools or
private schools operated for profit? That is the true analogy to the case we have
before us and I should think it pretty plain that such a scheme would not be
valid.
*** This policy of our Federal Constitution has never been wholly pleasing to
most religious groups. They all are quick to invoke its protections; they all are
irked when they feel its restraints. This Court has gone a long way, if not an
unreasonable way, to hold that public business of such paramount importance
as maintenance of public order, protection of the privacy of the home, and
taxation may not be pursued by a state in a way that even indirectly will
interfere with religious proselyting.
But we cannot have it both ways. Religious teaching cannot be a private affair
when the state seeks to impose regulations which infringe on it indirectly, and a

Robson

905

The First Amendment

public affair when it comes to taxing citizens of one faith to aid another, or
those of no faith to aid all. If these principles seem harsh in prohibiting aid to
Catholic education, it must not be forgotten that it is the same Constitution
that alone assures Catholics the right to maintain these schools at all when
predominant local sentiment would forbid them. Pierce v. Society of Sisters. Nor
should I think that those who have done so well without this aid would want to
see this separation between Church and State broken down. If the state may
aid these religious schools, it may therefore regulate them. Many groups have
sought aid from tax funds only to find that it carried political controls with it.
***
But in any event, the great purposes of the Constitution do not depend on the
approval or convenience of those they restrain. I cannot read the history of the
struggle to separate political from ecclesiastical affairs, well summarized in the
opinion of MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE in which I generally concur, without a
conviction that the Court today is unconsciously giving the clock's hands a
backward turn.
MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE, WITH WHOM MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE
JACKSON AND MR. JUSTICE BURTON AGREE, DISSENTING.
'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof. ....' U.S.Const.Am. Art. I.
'Well aware that Almighty God hath created the mind free; ... that to compel a
man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he
disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical; ...
'We, the General Assembly, do enact, That no man shall be compelled to
frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor
shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor
shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief. ...'

[“A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom," enacted by the General Assembly of
Virginia, January 19, 1786].
I cannot believe that the great author of those words [Thomas Jefferson] or the
men who made them law, could have joined in this decision. Neither so high nor
so impregnable today as yesterday is the wall raised between church and state
by Virginia's great statute of religious freedom and the First Amendment, now
made applicable to all the states by the Fourteenth. New Jersey's statute
sustained is the first, if indeed it is not the second breach to be made by this
Court's action. That a third, and a fourth, and still others will be attempted, we
may be sure. For just as Cochran v. Louisiana State Board of Education, has
opened the way by oblique ruling for this decision, so will the two make wider
the breach for a third. Thus with time the most solid freedom steadily gives way
before continuing corrosive decision.
This case forces us to determine squarely for the first time what was 'an
establishment of religion' in the First Amendment's conception; and by that
measure to decide whether New Jersey's action violates its command. ***

Robson

906

The First Amendment

I.
Not simply an established church, but any law respecting an establishment of
religion is forbidden. The Amendment was broadly but not loosely phrased. It is
the compact and exact summation of its author's views formed during his long
struggle for religious freedom. In Madison's own words characterizing
Jefferson's Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, the guaranty he put in our
national charter, like the bill he piloted through the Virginia Assembly, was 'a
Model of technical precision, and perspicuous brevity.' Madison could not have
confused 'church' and 'religion,' or 'an established church' and 'an
establishment or religion.'
The Amendment's purpose was not to strike merely at the official establishment
of a single sect, creed or religion, outlawing only a formal relation such as had
prevailed in England and some of the colonies. Necessarily it was to uproot all
such relationships. But the object was broader than separating church and
state in this narrow sense. It was to create a complete and permanent
separation of the spheres of religious activity and civil authority by
comprehensively forbidding every form of public aid or support for religion. In
proof the Amendment's wording and history unite with this Court's consistent
utterances whenever attention has been fixed directly upon the question.
'Religion' appears only once in the Amendment. But the word governs two
prohibitions and governs them alike. It does not have two meanings, one
narrow to forbid 'an establishment' and another, much broader, for securing
'the free exercise thereof.' 'Thereof' brings down 'religion' with its entire and
exact content, no more and no less, from the first into the second guaranty, so
that Congress and now the states are as broadly restricted concerning the one
as they are regarding the other.
No one would claim today that the Amendment is constricted, in 'prohibiting
the free exercise' of religion, to securing the free exercise of some formal or
creedal observance, of one sect or of many. It secures all forms of religious
expression, creedal, sectarian or nonsectarian wherever and however taking
place, except conduct which trenches upon the like freedoms of others or
clearly and presently endangers the community's good order and security. For
the protective purposes of this phase of the basic freedom street preaching, oral
or by distribution of literature, has been given 'the same high estate under the
First Amendment as ... worship in the churches and preaching from the
pulpits.' And on this basis parents have been held entitled to send their
children to private, religious schools. Pierce v. Society of Sisters. Accordingly,
daily religious education commingled with secular is 'religion' within the
guaranty's comprehensive scope. So are religious training and teaching in
whatever form. The word connotes the broadest content, determined not by the
form or formality of the teaching or where it occurs, but by its essential nature
regardless of those details.
'Religion' has the same broad significance in the twin prohibition concerning 'an
establishment.' The Amendment was not duplicitous. 'Religion' and
'establishment' were not used in any formal or technical sense. The prohibition
broadly forbids state support, financial or other, of religion in any guise, form or
degree. It outlaws all use of public funds for religious purposes.

Robson

907

The First Amendment

II.
No provision of the Constitution is more closely tied to or given content by its
generating history than the religious clause of the First Amendment. It is at
once the refined product and the terse summation of that history. The history
includes not only Madison's authorship and the proceedings before the First
Congress, but also the long and intensive struggle for religious freedom in
America, more especially in Virginia, of which the Amendment was the direct
culmination. In the documents of the times, particularly of Madison, who was
leader in the Virginia struggle before he became the Amendment's sponsor, but
also in the writings of Jefferson and others and in the issues which engendered
them is to be found irrefutable confirmation of the Amendment's sweeping
content.
For Madison, as also for Jefferson, religious freedom was the crux of the
struggle for freedom in general. Madison was coauthor with George Mason of
the religious clause in Virginia's great Declaration of Rights of 1776. He is
credited with changing it from a mere statement of the principle of tolerance to
the first official legislative pronouncement that freedom of conscience and
religion are inherent rights of the individual. He sought also to have the
Declaration expressly condemn the existing Virginia establishment. But the
forces supporting it were then too strong.
Accordingly Madison yielded on this phase but not for long. At once he resumed
the fight, continuing it before succeeding legislative sessions. As a member of
the General Assembly in 1779 he threw his full weight behind Jefferson's
historic Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom. That bill was a prime phase of
Jefferson's broad program of democratic reform undertaken on his return from
the Continental Congress in 1776 and submitted for the General Assembly's
consideration in 1779 as his proposed revised Virginia code. With Jefferson's
departure for Europe in 1784, Madison became the Bill's prime sponsor.
Enactment failed in successive legislatures from its introduction in June 1779,
until its adoption in January, 1786. But during all this time the fight for
religious freedom moved forward in Virginia on various fronts with growing
intensity. Madison led throughout, against Patrick Henry's powerful opposing
leadership until Henry was elected governor in November, 1784.
The climax came in the legislative struggle of 1784-1785 over the Assessment
Bill. This was nothing more nor less than a taxing measure for the support of
religion, designed to revive the payment of tithes suspended since 1777. So long
as it singled out a particular sect for preference it incurred the active and
general hostility of dissentient groups. It was broadened to include them, with
the result that some subsided temporarily in their opposition. As altered, the
bill gave to each taxpayer the privilege of designating which church should
receive his share of the tax. In default of designation the legislature applied it to
pious uses. But what is of the utmost significance here, 'in its final form the bill
left the taxpayer the option of giving his tax to education.' ***
[The Memorial and Remonstrance is] Madison's complete, though not his only,
interpretation of religious liberty. It is a broadside attack upon all forms of
'establishment' of religion, both general and particular, nondiscriminatory or
selective. Reflecting not only the many legislative conflicts over the Assessment
Bill and the Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom but also, for example, the

Robson

908

The First Amendment

struggles for religious incorporations and the continued maintenance of the
glebes, the Remonstrance is at once the most concise and the most accurate
statement of the views of the First Amendment's author concerning what is 'an
establishment of religion.' ***
The next year Madison became a member of the Constitutional Convention. Its
work done, he fought valiantly to secure the ratification of its great product in
Virginia as elsewhere, and nowhere else more effectively. Madison was certain
in his own mind that under the Constitution 'there is not a shadow of right in
the general government to intermeddle with religion' and that 'this subject is,
for the honor of America, perfectly free and unshackled. The Government has
no jurisdiction over it. . . .' Nevertheless he pledged that he would work for a
Bill of Rights, including a specific guaranty of religious freedom, and Virginia,
with other states, ratified the Constitution on this assurance.
*** All the great instruments of the Virginia struggle for religious liberty thus
became warp and woof of our constitutional tradition, not simply by the course
of history, but by the common unifying force of Madison's life, thought and
sponsorship. He epitomized the whole of that tradition in the Amendment's
compact, but nonetheless comprehensive, phrasing.
As the Remonstrance discloses throughout, Madison opposed every form and
degree of official relation between religion and civil authority. For him religion
was a wholly private matter beyond the scope of civil power either to restrain or
to support. Denial or abridgment of religious freedom was a violation of rights
both of conscience and of natural equality. State aid was no less obnoxious or
destructive to freedom and to religion itself than other forms of state
interference. 'Establishment' and 'free exercise' were correlative and coextensive
ideas, representing only different facets of the single great and fundamental
freedom. The Remonstrance, following the Virginia statute's example, referred to
the history of religious conflicts and the effects of all sorts of establishments,
current and historical, to suppress religion's free exercise. With Jefferson,
Madison believed that to tolerate any fragment of establishment would be by so
much to perpetuate restraint upon that freedom. Hence he sought to tear out
the institution not partially but root and branch, and to bar its return forever.
In no phase was he more unrelentingly absolute than in opposing state support
or aid by taxation. Not even 'three pence' contribution was thus to be exacted
from any citizen for such a purpose. Remonstrance, Par. 3.29 Tithes had been
the life blood of establishment before and after other compulsions disappeared.
Madison and his coworkers made no exceptions or abridgments to the complete
separation they created. Their objection was not to small tithes. It was to any
tithes whatsoever. 'If it were lawful to impose a small tax for religion the
admission would pave the way for oppressive levies.' Not the amount but 'the
principle of assessment was wrong.' And the principle was as much to prevent
'the interference of law in religion' as to restrain religious intervention in
political matters. In this field the authors of our freedom would not tolerate 'the
first experiment on our liberties' or 'wait till usurped power had strengthened
itself by exercise, and entangled the question in precedents.' Remonstrance, Par.
3. Nor should we.

Robson

909

The First Amendment

In view of this history no further proof is needed that the Amendment forbids
any appropriation, large or small, from public funds to aid or support any and
all religious exercises. But if more were called for, the debates in the First
Congress and this Court's consistent expressions, whenever it has touched on
the matter directly, supply it. By contrast with the Virginia history, the
congressional debates on consideration of the Amendment reveal only sparse
discussion, reflecting the fact that the essential issues had been settled. Indeed
the matter had become so well understood as to have been taken for granted in
all but formal phrasing. Hence, the only enlightening reference shows concern,
not to preserve any power to use public funds in aid of religion, but to prevent
the Amendment from outlawing private gifts inadvertently by virtue of the
breadth of its wording. In the margin are noted also the principal decisions in
which expressions of this Court confirm the Amendment's broad prohibition.
III.
Compulsory attendance upon religious exercises went out early in the process
of separating church and state, together with forced observance of religious
forms and ceremonies. Test oaths and religious qualification for office followed
later. These things none devoted to our great tradition of religious liberty would
think of bringing back. Hence today, apart from efforts to inject religious
training or exercises and sectarian issues into the public schools, the only
serious surviving threat to maintaining that complete and permanent
separation of religion and civil power which the First Amendment commands is
through use of the taxing power to support religion, religious establishments, or
establishments having a religious foundation whatever their form or special
religious function.
Does New Jersey's action furnish support for religion by use of the taxing
power? Certainly it does, if the test remains undiluted as Jefferson and Madison
made it, that money taken by taxation from one is not to be used or given to
support another's religious training or belief, or indeed one's own. Today as
then the furnishing of 'contributions of money for the propagation of opinions
which he disbelieves' is the forbidden exaction; and the prohibition is absolute
for whatever measure brings that consequence and whatever mount may be
sought or given to that end.
The funds used here were raised by taxation. The Court does not dispute nor
could it that their use does in fact give aid and encouragement to religious
instruction. It only concludes that this aid is not 'support' in law. But Madison
and Jefferson were concerned with aid and support in fact not as a legal
conclusion 'entangled in precedents.' Remonstrance, Par. 3. Here parents pay
money to send their children to parochial schools and funds raised by taxation
are used to reimburse them. This not only helps the children to get to school
and the parents to send them. It aids them in a substantial way to get the very
thing which they are sent to the particular school to secure, namely, religious
training and teaching.
Believers of all faiths, and others who do not express their feeling toward
ultimate issues of existence in any creedal form, pay the New Jersey tax. When
the money so raised is used to pay for transportation to religious schools, the
Catholic taxpayer to the extent of his proportionate share pays for the
transportation of Lutheran, Jewish and otherwise religiously affiliated children

Robson

910

The First Amendment

to receive their non-Catholic religious instruction. Their parents likewise pay
proportionately for the transportation of Catholic children to receive Catholic
instruction. Each thus contributes to 'the propagation of opinions which he
disbelieves' in so far as their religious differ, as do others who accept no creed
without regard to those differences. Each thus pays taxes also to support the
teaching of his own religion, an exaction equally forbidden since it denies 'the
comfortable liberty' of giving one's contribution to the particular agency of
instruction he approves.
New Jersey's action therefore exactly fits the type of exaction and the kind of
evil at which Madison and Jefferson struck. Under the test they framed it
cannot be said that the cost of transportation is no part of the cost of education
or of the religious instruction given. That it is a substantial and a necessary
element is shown most plainly by the continuing and increasing demand for the
state to assume it. Nor is there pretense that it relates only to the secular
instruction given in religious schools or that any attempt is or could be made
toward allocating proportional shares as between the secular and the religious
instruction. It is precisely because the instruction is religious and relates to a
particular faith, whether one or another, that parents send their children to
religious schools under the Pierce doctrine. And the very purpose of the state's
contribution is to defray the cost of conveying the pupil to the place where he
will receive not simply secular, but also and primarily religious, teaching and
guidance.
Indeed the view is sincerely avowed by many of various faiths, that the basic
purpose of all education is or should be religious, that the secular cannot be
and should not be separated from the religious phase and emphasis. Hence, the
inadequacy of public or secular education and the necessity for sending the
child to a school where religion is taught. But whatever may be the philosophy
or its justification, there is undeniably an admixture of religious with secular
teaching in all such institutions. That is the very reason for their being.
Certainly for purposes of constitutionality we cannot contradict the whole basis
of the ethical and educational convictions of people who believe in religious
schooling.
Yet this very admixture is what was disestablished when the First Amendment
forbade 'an establishment of religion.' Commingling the religious with the
secular teaching does not divest the whole of its religious permeation and
emphasis or make them of minor part, if proportion were material. Indeed, on
any other view, the constitutional prohibition always could be brought to
naught by adding a modicum of the secular.
An appropriation from the public treasury to pay the cost of transportation to
Sunday school, to weekday special classes at the church or parish house, or to
the meetings of various young people's religious societies, such as the Y.M.C.A.,
the Y.M.C.A., the Y.M.H.A., the Epworth League, could not withstand the
constitutional attack. This would be true, whether or not secular activities were
mixed with the religious. If such an appropriation could not stand, then it is
hard to see how one becomes valid for the same thing upon the more extended
scale of daily instruction. Surely constitutionality does not turn on where or
how often the mixed teaching occurs.

Robson

911

The First Amendment

Finally, transportation, where it is needed, is as essential to education as any
other element. Its cost is as much a part of the total expense, except at times in
amount, as the cost of textbooks, of school lunches, of athletic equipment, of
writing and other materials; indeed of all other items composing the total
burden. *** For me, therefore, the feat is impossible to select so indispensable
an item from the composite of total costs, and characterize it as not aiding,
contributing to, promoting or sustaining the propagation of beliefs which it is
the very end of all to bring about. Unless this can be maintained, and the Court
does not maintain it, the aid thus given is outlawed. Payment of transportation
is no more, nor is it any the less essential to education, whether religious or
secular, than payment for tuitions, for teachers' salaries, for buildings,
equipment and necessary materials. Nor is it any the less directly related, in a
school giving religious instruction, to the primary religious objective all those
essential items of cost are intended to achieve. No rational line can be drawn
between payment for such larger, but not more necessary, items and payment
for transportation. The only line that can be so drawn is one between more
dollars and less. Certainly in this realm such a line can be no valid
constitutional measure. Now, as in Madison's time, not the amount but the
principle of assessment is wrong. Remonstrance, Par. 3.
IV.
But we are told that the New Jersey statute is valid in its present application
because the appropriation is for a public, not a private purpose, namely, the
promotion of education, and the majority accept this idea in the conclusion that
all we have here is 'public welfare legislation.' If that is true and the
Amendment's force can be thus destroyed, what has been said becomes all the
more pertinent. For then there could be no possible objection to more extensive
support of religious education by New Jersey.
*** The reasons underlying the Amendment's policy have not vanished with
time or diminished in force. Now as when it was adopted the price of religious
freedom is double. It is that the church and religion shall live both within and
upon that freedom. There cannot be freedom of religion, safeguarded by the
state, and intervention by the church or its agencies in the state's domain or
dependency on its largesse. Madison's Remonstrance, Par. 6, 8. The great
condition of religious liberty is that it be maintained free from sustenance, as
also from other interferences, by the state. For when it comes to rest upon that
secular foundation it vanishes with the resting. Id., Par. 7, 8.45 Public money
devoted to payment of religious costs, educational or other, brings the quest for
more. It brings too the struggle of sect against sect for the larger share or for
any. Here one by numbers alone will benefit most, there another. That is
precisely the history of societies which have had an established religion and
dissident groups. Id., Par. 8, 11. It is the very thing Jefferson and Madison
experienced and sought to guard against, whether in its blunt or in its more
screened forms. Ibid. The end of such strife cannot be other than to destroy the
cherished liberty. The dominating group will achieve the dominant benefit; or all
will embroil the state in their dissensions. Id., Par. 11.46
Exactly such conflicts have centered of late around providing transportation to
religious schools from public funds. ***

Robson

912

The First Amendment

This is not therefore just a little case over bus fares. In paraphrase of Madison,
distant as it may be in its present form from a complete establishment of
religion, it differs from it only in degree; and is the first step in that direction.
Today as in his time 'the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute
three pence only ... for the support of any one religious establishment, may
force him' to pay more; or 'to conform to any other establishment in all cases
whatsoever.' And now, as then, 'either ... we must say, that the will of the
Legislature is the only measure of their authority; and that in the plenitude of
this authority, they may sweep away all our fundamental rights; or, that they
are bound to leave this particular right untouched and sacred.' Remonstrance,
Par. 15. ***
V.
No one conscious of religious values can by unsympathetic toward the burden
which our constitutional separation puts on parents who desire religious
instruction mixed with secular for their children. They pay taxes for others'
children's education, at the same time the added cost of instruction for their
own. Nor can one happily see benefits denied to children which others receive,
because in conscience they or their parents for them desire a different kind of
training others do not demand.
But if those feelings should prevail, there would be an end to our historic
constitutional policy and command. No more unjust or discriminatory in fact is
it to deny attendants at religious schools the cost of their transportation than it
is to deny them tuitions, sustenance for their teachers, or any other educational
expense which others receive at public cost. Hardship in fact there is which
none can blink. But, for assuring to those who undergo it the greater, the most
comprehensive freedom, it is one written by design and firm intent into our
basic law.
Of course discrimination in the legal sense does not exist. The child attending
the religious school has the same right as any other to attend the public school.
But he foregoes exercising it because the same guaranty which assures this
freedom forbids the public school or any agency of the state to give or aid him
in securing the religious instruction he seeks.
Were he to accept the common school, he would be the first to protest the
teaching there of any creed or faith not his own. And it is precisely for the
reason that their atmosphere is wholly secular that children are not sent to
public schools under the Pierce doctrine. But that is a constitutional necessity,
because we have staked the very existence of our country on the faith that
complete separation between the state and religion is best for the state and best
for religion. Remonstrance, Par. 8, 12.
*** The Constitution requires, not comprehensive identification of state with
religion, but complete separation.
VI.
The judgment should be reversed.

(As reproduced as Appendix A to Everson v. Board of Education)
MEMORIAL AND REMONSTRANCE AGAINST RELIGIOUS ASSESSMENTS.
TO THE HONORABLE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA.
A MEMORIAL AND REMONSTRANCE.
We, the subscribers, citizens of the said Commonwealth, having taken into serious consideration,
a Bill printed by order of the last Session of General Assembly, entitled 'A Bill establishing a
provision for teachers of the Christian Religion,' and conceiving that the same, if finally armed
with the sanctions of a law, will be a dangerous abuse of power, are bound as faithful members of
a free State, to remonstrate against it, and to declare the reasons by which we are determined. We
remonstruate against the said Bill,
1. Because we hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, 'that religion, or the duty which
we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and
conviction, not by force or violence.' 1 The Religion then of every man must be left to the
conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these
may dictate. This right is in its nature an unalienable right. It is unalienable; because the
opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated by their own minds, cannot follow
the dictates of other men: It is unalienable also; because what is here a right towards men, is a
duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage, and
such only, as he believes to be acceptable to him. This duty is predecent both in order of time and
degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil Society. Before any man can be considered as a member
of Civil Society, he must be considered as a subject of the Governor of the Universe: And if a
member of Civil Society, who enters into any subordinate Association, must always do it with a
reservation of his duty to the general authority; much more must every man who becomes a
member of any particular Civil Society, do it with a saving of his allegiance to the Universal
Sovereign. We maintain therefore that in matters of Religion, no man's right is abridged by the
institution of Civil Society, and that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance. True it is, that
no other rule exists, by which any question which may divide a Society, can be ultimately
determined, but the will of the majority; but it is also true, that the majority may trespass on the
rights of the minority.
2. Because if religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be
subject to that of the Legislative Body. The latter are but the creatures and vicegerents of the
former. Their jurisdiction is both derivative and limited: it is limited with regard to the co-ordinate
departments, more necessarily is it limited with regard to the constituents. The preservation of a
free government requires not merely, that the metes and bounds which separate each department
of power may be invariably maintained; but more especially, that neither of them be suffered to
overleap the great Barrier which defends the rights of the people. The Rulers who are guilty of
such an encroachment, exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are
Tyrants. The People who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves, nor by an
authority derived from them, and are slaves.
3. Because, it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties. We hold this
prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and one of (the) noblest characteristics of the late
Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by
exercise, and entangled the question in precedents. They saw all the consequences in the
principle, and they avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this lesson too
much, soon to forget it. Who does not see that the same authority which can establish
Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish with the same ease any particular
sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other Sects? That the same authority which can force a
citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment,
may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?
4. Because, the bill violates that equality which ought to be the basis of every law, and which is
more indispensable, in proportion as the validity or expediency of any law is more liable to be
impeached. If 'all men are by nature equally free and independent,' all men are to be considered
as entering into Society on equal conditions; as relinquishing no more, and therefore retaining no

Robson

914

The First Amendment

less, one than another, of their natural rights. Above all are they to be considered as retaining an
'equal title to the free exercise of Religion according to the dictates of conscience'. Whilst we
assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace, to profess and to observe the Religion which we believe
to be of divine origin, we cannot deny an equal freedom to those whose minds have not yet yielded
to the evidence which has convinced us. If this freedom be abused, it is an offence against God,
not against man: To God, therefore, not to men, must an account of it be rendered. As the bill
violates equality by subjecting some to peculiar burdens; so it violates the same principle, by
granting to others peculiar exemptions. Are the Quakers and Menonists the only sects who think
a compulsive support of their religions unnecessary and unwarrantable? Can their piety alone be
intrusted with the care of public worship? Ought their Religions to be endowed above all others,
with extraordinary privileges, by which proselytes may be enticed from all others? We think too
favorably of the justice and good sense of these denominations, to believe that they either covet
pre-eminencies over their fellow citizens, or that they will be seduced by them, from the common
opposition to the measure.
5. Because the bill implies either that the Civil Magistrate is a competent Judge of Religious
truth; or that he may employ Religion as an engine of Civil policy. The first is an arrogant
pretension falsified by the contradictory opinions of Rulers in all ages, and throughout the world:
The second an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation.
6. Because the establishment proposed by the Bill is not requisite for the support of the Christian
Religion. To say that it is, is a contradiction to the Christian Religion itself; for every page of it
disavows a dependence on the powers of this world: it is a contradiction to fact; for it is known
that this Religion both existed and flourished, not only without the support of human laws, but in
spite of every opposition from them; and not only during the period of miraculous aid, but long
after it had been left to its own evidence, and the ordinary care of Providence: Nay, it is a
contradiction in terms; for a Religion not invented by human policy, must have pre-existed and
been supported, before it was established by human policy. It is moreover to weaken in those who
profess this Religion a pious confidence in its innate excellence, and the patronage of its Author;
and to foster in those who still reject it, a suspicion that its friends are too conscious of its
fallacies, to trust it to its own merits.
7. Because experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the
purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation. During almost fifteen centuries,
has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What have been its fruits? More or less
in all places, pride and indolence in the Clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both,
superstition, bigotry and persecution. Enquire of the Teachers of Christianity for the ages in
which it appeared in its greatest lustre; those of every sect, point to the ages prior to its
incorporation with Civil policy. Propose a restoration of this primitive state in which its Teachers
depended on the voluntary rewards of their flocks; many of them predict its downfall. On which
side ought their testimony to have greatest weight, when for or when against their interest?
8. Because the establishment in question is not necessary for the support of Civil Government. If
it be urged as necessary for the support of Civil Government only as it is a means of supporting
Religion, and it be not necessary for the latter purpose, it cannot be necessary for the former. If
Religion be not within (the) cognizance of Civil Government, how can its legal establishment be
said to be necessary to Civil Government? What influence in fact have ecclesiastical
establishments had on Civil Society? In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual
tyranny on the ruins of Civil authority; in many instances they have been seen upholding the
thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been seen the guardians of the liberties of
the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberties, may have found an established
clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure & perpetuate it, needs them
not. Such a government will be best supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his
Religion with the same equal hand which protects his person and his property; by neither
invading the equal rights by any Sect, nor suffering any Sect to invade those of another.
9. Because the proposed establishment is a departure from that generous policy, which, offering
an asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of every Nation and Religion, promised a lustre to our
country, and an accession to the number of its citizens. What a melancholy mark is the Bill of
sudden degeneracy? Instead of holding forth an asylum to the persecuted, it is itself a signal of
persecution. It degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do
not bend to those of the Legislative authority. Distant as it may be, in its present form, from the
Inquisition it differs from it only in degree. The one is the first step, the other the last in the

Robson

915

The First Amendment

career of intolerance. The magnanimous sufferer under this cruel scourge in foreign Regions,
must view the Bill as a Beacon on our Coast, warning him to seek some other haven, where
liberty and philanthropy in their due extent may offer a more certain repose from his troubles.
10. Because, it will have a like tendency to banish our Citizens. The allurements presented by
other situations are every day thinning their number. To superadd a fresh motive to emigration,
by revoking the liberty which they now enjoy, would be the same species of folly which has
dishonoured and depopulated flourishing kingdoms.
11. Because, it will destroy that moderation and harmony which the forbearance of our laws to
intermeddle with Religion, has produced amongst its several sects. Torrents of blood have been
spilt in the old world, by vain attempts of the secular arm to extinguish Religious discord, by
proscribing all difference in Religious opinions. Time has at length revealed the true remedy.
Every relaxation of narrow and rigorous policy, wherever it has been tried, has been found to
assuage the disease. The American Theatre has exhibited proofs, that equal and complete liberty,
if it does not wholly eradicate it, sufficiently destroys its malignant influence on the health and
prosperity of the State. If with the salutary effects of this system under o r own eyes, we begin to
contract the bonds of Religious freedom, we know no name that will too severely reproach our
folly. At least let warning be taken at the first fruit of the threatened innovation. The very
appearance of the Bill has transformed that 'Christian forbearance, love and charity,' which of
late mutually prevailed, into animosities and jealousies, which may not soon be appeased. What
mischiefs may not be dreaded should this enemy to the public quiet be armed with the force of a
law?
12. Because, the policy of the bill is adverse to the diffusion of the light of Christianity. The first
wish of those who enjoy this precious gift, ought to be that it may be imparted to the whole race
of mankind. Compare the number of those who have as yet received it with the number still
remaining under the dominion of false Religions; and how small is the former! Does the policy of
the Bill tend to lessen the disproportion? No; it at once discourages those who are strangers to
the light of ( revelation) from coming into the Region of it; and countenances, by example the
nations who continue in darkness, in shutting out those who might convey it to them. Instead of
levelling as far as possible, every obstacle to the victorious progress of truth, the Bill with an
ignoble and unchristian timidity would circumscribe it, with a wall of defence, against the
encroachments of error.
13. Because attempts to enforce by legal sanctions, acts obnoxious to so great a proportion of
Citizens, tend to enervate the laws in general, and to slacken the bands of Society. If it be difficult
to execute any law which is not generally deemed necessary or salutary, what must be the case
where it is deemed invalid and dangerous? and what may be the effect of so striking an example
of impotency in the Government, on its general authority?
14. Because a measure of such singular magnitude and delicacy ought not to be imposed,
without the clearest evidence that it is called for by a majority of citizens: and no satisfactory
method is yet proposed by which the voice of the majority in this case may be determined, or its
influence secured. 'The people of the respective counties are indeed requested to signify their
opinion respecting the adoption of the Bill to the next Session of Assembly.' But the
representation must be made equal, before the voice either of the Representatives or of the
Counties, will be that of the people. Our hope is that neither of the former will, after due
consideration, expouse the dangerous principle of the Bill. Should the event disappoint us, it will
still leave us in full confidence, that a fair appeal to the latter will reverse the sentence against
our liberties.
15. Because, finally, 'the equal right of every citizen to the free exercise of his Religion according
to the dictates of conscience' is held by the same tenure with all our other rights. If we recur to its
origin, it is equally the gift of nature; if we weigh its importance, it cannot be less dear to us; if we
consult the Declaration of those rights which pertain to the good people of Virginia, as the 'basis
and foundation of Government,'it is enumerated with equal solemnity, or rather studied emphasis.
Either then, we must say, that the will of the Legislature is the only measure of their authority;
and that in the plentitude of this authority, they may sweep away all our fundamental rights; or,
that they are bound to leave this particular right untouched and sacred: Either we must say, that
they may controul the freedom of the press, may abolish the trial by jury, may swallow up the
Executive and Judiciary Powers of the State; nay that they may despoil us of our very right of
suffrage, and erect themselves into an independent and hereditary assembly: or we must say,

Robson

916

The First Amendment

that they have no authority to enact into law the Bill under consideration. We the subscribers say,
that the General Assembly of this Commonwealth have no such authority: A d that no effort may
be omitted on our part against so dangerous an usurpation, we oppose to it, this remonstrance;
earnestly praying, as we are in duty bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver of the Universe, by
illuminating those to whom it is addressed, may on the one hand, turn their councils from every
act which would affront his holy prerogative, or violate the trust committed to them: and on the
other, guide them into every measure which may be worthy of his (blessing, may re) dound to
their own praise, and may establish more firmly the liberties, the prosperity, and the Happiness
of the Commonwealth.

Note:	  The	  “Release	  Time”	  Cases	  	  
Can time spent in religious instruction be used to satisfy state-mandated
compulsory education requirements? Does it matter for Establishment
Clause purposes whether that instruction occurs in the school building
or outside of it?
With only a single dissenting Justice (Reed), but with separate
concurring opinions, the Court decided People of State of Ill. ex rel.
McCollum v. Bd. of Ed. of Sch. Dist. No. 71, Champaign Cnty., Ill., 333 U.S.
203 (1948), and held unconstitutional a scheme in which private
religious groups were permitted to come weekly into the school buildings
during the regular hours set apart for secular teaching, and substitute
their religious teaching for the secular education provided under the
compulsory education law. The Court’s opinion, authored by Justice
Black, and joined by Vinson, Murphy, and - - - importantly, Douglas - - concluded by stating that
Here not only are the state's taxsupported public school buildings used for the
dissemination of religious doctrines. The State also affords sectarian groups an
invaluable aid in that it helps to provide pupils for their religious classes
through use of the state's compulsory public school machinery. This is not
separation of Church and State.

The concurring opinion authored by Justice Frankfurter, and joined by
Jackson, Rutledge, and Burton, sought to “renew our conviction that ‘we
have staked the very existence of our country on the faith that complete
separation between the state and religion is best for the state and best
for religion.’ [quoting and citing Everson]. If nowhere else, in the relation
between Church and State, ‘good fences make good neighbors.’
This opinion was widely seen as anti-Catholic. A few years later, the
Court declined to find McCullom v. Board of Education controlling when
the religious instruction occurred outside of the school building. In
Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), the Court upheld a New York law
allowing students to be “released” from school in order to go to religious
centers for religious instruction or devotional exercises. In accordance
with compulsory attendance laws, students not “released” stayed in the
classrooms and received instruction; religious authorities had to report
to the schools the names of children released from public schools who
Robson

917

The First Amendment

fail to report for religious instruction. Three Justices dissented, each
writing separate dissenting opinions: Black, Frankfurter, and Jackson.
The Court’s opinion, written by Justice Douglas, concluded that the
“release” program involved neither religious instruction in public schools
nor the expenditure of public funds. Justice Douglas’s opinion is most
notable for the following passage:
We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. We
guarantee the freedom to worship as one chooses. We make room for as wide a
variety of beliefs and creeds as the spiritual needs of man deem necessary. We
sponsor an attitude on the part of government that shows no partiality to any
one group and that lets each flourish according to the zeal of its adherents and
the appeal of its dogma. When the state encourages religious instruction or
cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events
to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions. For it then respects the
religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their
spiritual needs. To hold that it may not would be to find in the Constitution a
requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups.

There are those who critique this passage from Douglas as being entirely
self-serving and related to Douglas’s contemplation of a presidential run
and the “Catholic vote.” It does seem that Douglas’s later opinions
disavow this view.
As to whether or not McCollum and Zorach can be reconciled by the
inside/outside the school building distinction at least one commentator
has argued:
In those cases, like McCollum, where the ambiguity in the final opinions results
from the Court's failure to decide certain questions, even the most exacting
textual exegesis cannot penetrate that ambiguity *** The inconsistency between
the broad nature of the principles which support the majority opinions in
McCollum and Justice Burton's private agreement to keep the constitutionality of
the New York plan an open question may well have contributed in McCollum and
Zorach to the inconsistencies which have never been wholly and convincingly
explained.

370 U.S. 421 (1962)
JUSTICE BLACK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH WARREN, C.J., AND DOUGLAS,
CLARK, HARLAN, AND BRENNAN, J.J., JOINED. DOUGLAS, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION.
STEWART, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION. FRANKFURTER AND WHITE, J.J., TOOK NO PART IN THE
DECISION OF THIS CASE.

JUSTICE BLACK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The respondent Board of Education of Union Free School District No. 9, New
Hyde Park, New York, acting in its official capacity under state law, directed the
School District's principal to cause the following prayer to be said aloud by each
class in the presence of a teacher at the beginning of each school day:

"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy
blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country."

This daily procedure was adopted on the recommendation of the State Board of
Regents, a governmental agency created by the State Constitution to which the
New York Legislature has granted broad supervisory, executive, and legislative
powers over the State's public school system. These state officials composed the
prayer which they recommended and published as a part of their "Statement on
Moral and Spiritual Training in the Schools," saying: "We believe that this
Statement will be subscribed to by all men and women of good will, and we call
upon all of them to aid in giving life to our program."
Shortly after the practice of reciting the Regents' prayer was adopted by the
School District, the parents of ten pupils brought this action in a New York
State Court insisting that use of this official prayer in the public schools was
contrary to the beliefs, religions, or religious practices of both themselves and
their children. Among other things, these parents challenged the
constitutionality of both the state law authorizing the School District to direct
the use of prayer in public schools and the School District's regulation ordering
the recitation of this particular prayer on the ground that these actions of
official governmental agencies violate that part of the First Amendment of the
Federal Constitution which commands that "Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion" - a command which was "made
applicable to the State of New York by the Fourteenth Amendment of the said
Constitution." The New York Court of Appeals, over the dissents of Judges Dye
and Fuld, sustained an order of the lower state courts which had upheld the
power of New York to use the Regents' prayer as a part of the daily procedures
of its public schools so long as the schools did not compel any pupil to join in
the prayer over his or his parents' objection. We granted certiorari to review this
important decision involving rights protected by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments.
We think that by using its public school system to encourage recitation of the
Regents' prayer, the State of New York has adopted a practice wholly
inconsistent with the Establishment Clause. There can, of course, be no doubt
that New York's program of daily classroom invocation of God's blessings as
prescribed in the Regents' prayer is a religious activity. It is a solemn avowal of
divine faith and supplication for the blessings of the Almighty. The nature of

Robson

919

The First Amendment

such a prayer has always been religious, none of the respondents has denied
this and the trial court expressly so found.***
The petitioners contend among other things that the state laws requiring or
permitting use of the Regents' prayer must be struck down as a violation of the
Establishment Clause because that prayer was composed by governmental
officials as a part of a governmental program to further religious beliefs. For this
reason, petitioners argue, the State's use of the Regents' prayer in its public
school system breaches the constitutional wall of separation between Church
and State. We agree with that contention since we think that the constitutional
prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least
mean that in this country it is no part of the business of government to
compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part
of a religious program carried on by government.
It is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally
composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused
many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in
America. The Book of Common Prayer, which was created under governmental
direction and which was approved by Acts of Parliament in 1548 and 1549, set
out in minute detail the accepted form and content of prayer and other religious
ceremonies to be used in the established, tax-supported Church of England.
The controversies over the Book and what should be its content repeatedly
threatened to disrupt the peace of that country as the accepted forms of prayer
in the established church changed with the views of the particular ruler that
happened to be in control at the time. Powerful groups representing some of the
varying religious views of the people struggled among themselves to impress
their particular views upon the Government and obtain amendments of the
Book more suitable to their respective notions of how religious services should
be conducted in order that the official religious establishment would advance
their particular religious beliefs. Other groups, lacking the necessary political
power to influence the Government on the matter, decided to leave England and
its established church and seek freedom in America from England's
governmentally ordained and supported religion.
It is an unfortunate fact of history that when some of the very groups which
had most strenuously opposed the established Church of England found
themselves sufficiently in control of colonial governments in this country to
write their own prayers into law, they passed laws making their own religion the
official religion of their respective colonies. Indeed, as late as the time of the
Revolutionary War, there were established churches in at least eight of the
thirteen former colonies and established religions in at least four of the other
five. But the successful Revolution against English political domination was
shortly followed by intense opposition to the practice of establishing religion by
law. This opposition crystallized rapidly into an effective political force in
Virginia where the minority religious groups such as Presbyterians, Lutherans,
Quakers and Baptists had gained such strength that the adherents to the
established Episcopal Church were actually a minority themselves. In 17851786, those opposed to the established Church, led by James Madison and
Thomas Jefferson, who, though themselves not members of any of these
dissenting religious groups, opposed all religious establishments by law on

Robson

920

The First Amendment

grounds of principle, obtained the enactment of the famous "Virginia Bill for
Religious Liberty" by which all religious groups were placed on an equal footing
so far as the State was concerned. Similar though less far-reaching legislation
was being considered and passed in other States.
By the time of the adoption of the Constitution, our history shows that there
was a widespread awareness among many Americans of the dangers of a union
of Church and State. These people knew, some of them from bitter personal
experience, that one of the greatest dangers to the freedom of the individual to
worship in his own way lay in the Government's placing its official stamp of
approval upon one particular kind of prayer or one particular form of religious
services. They knew the anguish, hardship and bitter strife that could come
when zealous religious groups struggled with one another to obtain the
Government's stamp of approval from each King, Queen, or Protector that came
to temporary power. The Constitution was intended to avert a part of this
danger by leaving the government of this country in the hands of the people
rather than in the hands of any monarch. But this safeguard was not enough.
Our Founders were no more willing to let the content of their prayers and their
privilege of praying whenever they pleased be influenced by the ballot box than
they were to let these vital matters of personal conscience depend upon the
succession of monarchs. The First Amendment was added to the Constitution
to stand as a guarantee that neither the power nor the prestige of the Federal
Government would be used to control, support or influence the kinds of prayer
the American people can say - that the people's religious must not be subjected
to the pressures of government for change each time a new political
administration is elected to office. Under that Amendment's prohibition against
governmental establishment of religion, as reinforced by the provisions of the
Fourteenth Amendment, government in this country, be it state or federal, is
without power to prescribe by law any particular form of prayer which is to be
used as an official prayer in carrying on any program of governmentally
sponsored religious activity.
There can be no doubt that New York's state prayer program officially
establishes the religious beliefs embodied in the Regents' prayer. The
respondents' argument to the contrary, which is largely based upon the
contention that the Regents' prayer is "non-denominational" and the fact that
the program, as modified and approved by state courts, does not require all
pupils to recite the prayer but permits those who wish to do so to remain silent
or be excused from the room, ignores the essential nature of the program's
constitutional defects. Neither the fact that the prayer may be denominationally
neutral nor the fact that its observance on the part of the students is voluntary
can serve to free it from the limitations of the Establishment Clause, as it might
from the Free Exercise Clause, of the First Amendment, both of which are
operative against the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although
these two clauses may in certain instances overlap, they forbid two quite
different kinds of governmental encroachment upon religious freedom. The
Establishment Clause, unlike the Free Exercise Clause, does not depend upon
any showing of direct governmental compulsion and is violated by the
enactment of laws which establish an official religion whether those laws
operate directly to coerce nonobserving individuals or not. This is not to say, of
course, that laws officially prescribing a particular form of religious worship do

Robson

921

The First Amendment

not involve coercion of such individuals. When the power, prestige and financial
support of government is placed behind a particular religious belief, the indirect
coercive pressure upon religious minorities to conform to the prevailing officially
approved religion is plain. But the purposes underlying the Establishment
Clause go much further than that. Its first and most immediate purpose rested
on the belief that a union of government and religion tends to destroy
government and to degrade religion. The history of governmentally established
religion, both in England and in this country, showed that whenever
government had allied itself with one particular form of religion, the inevitable
result had been that it had incurred the hatred, disrespect and even contempt
of those who held contrary beliefs. That same history showed that many people
had lost their respect for any religion that had relied upon the support of
government to spread its faith. The Establishment Clause thus stands as an
expression of principle on the part of the Founders of our Constitution that
religion is too personal, too sacred, too holy, to permit its "unhallowed
perversion" by a civil magistrate. Another purpose of the Establishment Clause
rested upon an awareness of the historical fact that governmentally established
religions and religious persecutions go hand in hand. The Founders knew that
only a few years after the Book of Common Prayer became the only accepted
form of religious services in the established Church of England, an Act of
Uniformity was passed to compel all Englishmen to attend those services and to
make it a criminal offense to conduct or attend religious gatherings of any other
kind - a law which was consistently flouted by dissenting religious groups in
England and which contributed to widespread persecutions of people like John
Bunyan who persisted in holding "unlawful [religious] meetings . . . to the great
disturbance and distraction of the good subjects of this kingdom . . . ." And
they knew that similar persecutions had received the sanction of law in several
of the colonies in this country soon after the establishment of official religions
in those colonies. It was in large part to get completely away from this sort of
systematic religious persecution that the Founders brought into being our
Nation, our Constitution, and our Bill of Rights with its prohibition against any
governmental establishment of religion. The New York laws officially prescribing
the Regents' prayer are inconsistent both with the purposes of the
Establishment Clause and with the Establishment Clause itself.
It has been argued that to apply the Constitution in such a way as to prohibit
state laws respecting an establishment of religious services in public schools is
to indicate a hostility toward religion or toward prayer. Nothing, of course, could
be more wrong. The history of man is inseparable from the history of religion.
And perhaps it is not too much to say that since the beginning of that history
many people have devoutly believed that "More things are wrought by prayer
than this world dreams of." It was doubtless largely due to men who believed
this that there grew up a sentiment that caused men to leave the cross-currents
of officially established state religions and religious persecution in Europe and
come to this country filled with the hope that they could find a place in which
they could pray when they pleased to the God of their faith in the language they
chose. And there were men of this same faith in the power of prayer who led
the fight for adoption of our Constitution and also for our Bill of Rights with the
very guarantees of religious freedom that forbid the sort of governmental activity
which New York has attempted here. These men knew that the First

Robson

922

The First Amendment

Amendment, which tried to put an end to governmental control of religion and
of prayer, was not written to destroy either. They knew rather that it was
written to quiet well-justified fears which nearly all of them felt arising out of an
awareness that governments of the past had shackled men's tongues to make
them speak only the religious thoughts that government wanted them to speak
and to pray only to the God that government wanted them to pray to. It is
neither sacrilegious nor antireligious to say that each separate government in
this country should stay out of the business of writing or sanctioning official
prayers and leave that purely religious function to the people themselves and to
those the people choose to look to for religious guidance.
It is true that New York's establishment of its Regents' prayer as an officially
approved religious doctrine of that State does not amount to a total
establishment of one particular religious sect to the exclusion of all others that, indeed, the governmental endorsement of that prayer seems relatively
insignificant when compared to the governmental encroachments upon religion
which were commonplace 200 years ago. To those who may subscribe to the
view that because the Regents' official prayer is so brief and general there can
be no danger to religious freedom in its governmental establishment, however, it
may be appropriate to say in the words of James Madison, the author of the
First Amendment:
"[I]t is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties. . . . Who does
not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of
all other Religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of
Christians, in exclusion of all other Sects? That the same authority which can
force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of
any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in
all cases whatsoever?"

The judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York is reversed and the cause
remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE DOUGLAS, CONCURRING.
It is customary in deciding a constitutional question to treat it in its narrowest
form. Yet at times the setting of the question gives it a form and content which
no abstract treatment could give. The point for decision is whether the
Government can constitutionally finance a religious exercise. Our system at the
federal and state levels is presently honeycombed with such financing.
Nevertheless, I think it is an unconstitutional undertaking whatever form it
takes. ***
What New York does on the opening of its public schools is what we do when we
open court. Our Crier has from the beginning announced the convening of the
Court and then added "God save the United States and this Honorable Court."
That utterance is a supplication, a prayer in which we, the judges, are free to
join, but which we need not recite any more than the students need recite the
New York prayer.

Robson

923

The First Amendment

What New York does on the opening of its public schools is what each House of
Congress does at the opening of each day's business. Reverend Frederick B.
Harris is Chaplain of the Senate; Reverend Bernard Braskamp is Chaplain of
the House. Guest chaplains of various denominations also officiate.
In New York the teacher who leads in prayer is on the public payroll; and the
time she takes seems minuscule as compared with the salaries appropriated by
state legislatures and Congress for chaplains to conduct prayers in the
legislative halls. Only a bare fraction of the teacher's time is given to reciting
this short 22-word prayer, about the same amount of time that our Crier
spends announcing the opening of our sessions and offering a prayer for this
Court. Yet for me the principle is the same, no matter how briefly the prayer is
said, for in each of the instances given the person praying is a public official on
the public payroll, performing a religious exercise in a governmental institution.
It is said that the element of coercion is inherent in the giving of this prayer. If
that is true here, it is also true of the prayer with which this Court is convened,
and of those that open the Congress. Few adults, let alone children, would leave
our courtroom or the Senate or the House while those prayers are being given.
Every such audience is in a sense a "captive" audience.
At the same time I cannot say that to authorize this prayer is to establish a
religion in the strictly historic meaning of those words. A religion is not
established in the usual sense merely by letting those who choose to do so say
the prayer that the public school teacher leads. Yet once government finances a
religious exercise it inserts a divisive influence into our communities. The New
York Court said that the prayer given does not conform to all of the tenets of the
Jewish, Unitarian, and Ethical Culture groups. One of the petitioners is an
agnostic. ***
My problem today would be uncomplicated but for Everson v. Board of
Education, which allowed taxpayers' money to be used to pay "the bus fares of
parochial school pupils as a part of a general program under which" the fares of
pupils attending public and other schools were also paid. The Everson case
seems in retrospect to be out of line with the First Amendment. Its result is
appealing, as it allows aid to be given to needy children. Yet by the same token,
public funds could be used to satisfy other needs of children in parochial
schools - lunches, books, and tuition being obvious examples. ***
What New York does with this prayer is a break with that tradition. I therefore
join the Court in reversing the judgment below.
JUSTICE STEWART, DISSENTING.
A local school board in New York has provided that those pupils who wish to do
so may join in a brief prayer at the beginning of each school day, acknowledging
their dependence upon God and asking His blessing upon them and upon their
parents, their teachers, and their country. The Court today decides that in
permitting this brief nondenominational prayer the school board has violated
the Constitution of the United States. I think this decision is wrong.
*** With all respect, I think the Court has misapplied a great constitutional
principle. I cannot see how an "official religion" is established by letting those

Robson

924

The First Amendment

who want to say a prayer say it. On the contrary, I think that to deny the wish
of these school children to join in reciting this prayer is to deny them the
opportunity of sharing in the spiritual heritage of our Nation.
***What is relevant to the issue here is not the history of an established church
in sixteenth century England or in eighteenth century America, but the history
of the religious traditions of our people, reflected in countless practices of the
institutions and officials of our government.
At the opening of each day's Session of this Court we stand, while one of our
officials invokes the protection of God. Since the days of John Marshall our
Crier has said, "God save the United States and this Honorable Court." Both the
Senate and the House of Representatives open their daily Sessions with prayer.
Each of our Presidents, from George Washington to John F. Kennedy, has upon
assuming his Office asked the protection and help of God.
The Court today says that the state and federal governments are without
constitutional power to prescribe any particular form of words to be recited by
any group of the American people on any subject touching religion. One of the
stanzas of "The Star-Spangled Banner," made our National Anthem by Act of
Congress in 1931, contains these verses:
"Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto `In God
is our Trust.'"

In 1954 Congress added a phrase to the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag so that
it now contains the words "one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and
justice for all." In 1952 Congress enacted legislation calling upon the President
each year to proclaim a National Day of Prayer. Since 1865 the words "IN GOD
WE TRUST" have been impressed on our coins.
Countless similar examples could be listed, but there is no need to belabor the
obvious. ***
I do not believe that this Court, or the Congress, or the President has by the
actions and practices I have mentioned established an "official religion" in
violation of the Constitution. And I do not believe the State of New York has
done so in this case. What each has done has been to recognize and to follow
the deeply entrenched and highly cherished spiritual traditions of our Nation traditions which come down to us from those who almost two hundred years
ago avowed their "firm Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence" when
they proclaimed the freedom and independence of this brave new world. I

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
These two appeals raise questions as to Pennsylvania and Rhode Island
statutes providing state aid to church-related elementary and secondary
schools. Both statutes are challenged as violative of the Establishment and Free
Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.
Pennsylvania has adopted a statutory program that provides financial support
to nonpublic elementary and secondary schools by way of reimbursement for
the cost of teachers' salaries, textbooks, and instructional materials in specified
secular subjects. Rhode Island has adopted a statute under which the State
pays directly to teachers in nonpublic elementary schools a supplement of 15%
of their annual salary. Under each statute state aid has been given to churchrelated educational institutions. We hold that both statutes are
unconstitutional.
I
The Rhode Island Statute
The Rhode Island Salary Supplement Act 1 was enacted in 1969. It rests on the
legislative finding that the quality of education available in nonpublic
elementary schools has been jeopardized by the rapidly rising salaries needed to
attract competent and dedicated teachers. The Act authorizes state officials to
supplement the salaries of teachers of secular subjects in nonpublic elementary
schools by paying directly to a teacher an amount not in excess of 15% of his
current annual salary. As supplemented, however, a nonpublic school teacher's
salary cannot exceed the maximum paid to teachers in the State's public
schools, and the recipient must be certified by the state board of education in
substantially the same manner as public school teachers.
In order to be eligible for the Rhode Island salary supplement, the recipient
must teach in a nonpublic school at which the average per-pupil expenditure
on secular education is less than the average in the State's public schools

Robson

926

The First Amendment

during a specified period. Appellant State Commissioner of Education also
requires eligible schools to submit financial data. If this information indicates a
per-pupil expenditure in excess of the statutory limitation, the records of the
school in question must be examined in order to assess how much of the
expenditure is attributable to secular education and how much to religious
activity.
The Act also requires that teachers eligible for salary supplements must teach
only those subjects that are offered in the State's public schools. They must use
"only teaching materials which are used in the public schools." Finally, any
teacher applying for a salary supplement must first agree in writing "not to
teach a course in religion for so long as or during such time as he or she
receives any salary supplements" under the Act.
Appellees are citizens and taxpayers of Rhode Island. They brought this suit to
have the Rhode Island Salary Supplement Act declared unconstitutional and its
operation enjoined on the ground that it violates the Establishment and Free
Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment. Appellants are state officials charged
with administration of the Act, teachers eligible for salary supplements under
the Act, and parents of children in church-related elementary schools whose
teachers would receive state salary assistance.
A three-judge federal court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281, 2284. It
found that Rhode Island's nonpublic elementary schools accommodated
approximately 25% of the State's pupils. About 95% of these pupils attended
schools affiliated with the Roman Catholic church. To date some 250 teachers
have applied for benefits under the Act. All of them are employed by Roman
Catholic schools.
The court held a hearing at which extensive evidence was introduced
concerning the nature of the secular instruction offered in the Roman Catholic
schools whose teachers would be eligible for salary assistance under the Act.
Although the court found that concern for religious values does not necessarily
affect the content of secular subjects, it also found that the parochial school
system was "an integral part of the religious mission of the Catholic Church."
The District Court concluded that the Act violated the Establishment Clause,
holding that it fostered "excessive entanglement" between government and
religion. In addition two judges thought that the Act had the impermissible
effect of giving "significant aid to a religious enterprise." We affirm.
The Pennsylvania Statute
Pennsylvania has adopted a program that has some but not all of the features
of the Rhode Island program. The Pennsylvania Nonpublic Elementary and
Secondary Education Act was passed in 1968 in response to a crisis that the
Pennsylvania Legislature found existed in the State's nonpublic schools due to
rapidly rising costs. The statute affirmatively reflects the legislative conclusion
that the State's educational goals could appropriately be fulfilled by government
support of "those purely secular educational objectives achieved through
nonpublic education . . . ."
The statute authorizes appellee state Superintendent of Public Instruction to
"purchase" specified "secular educational services" from nonpublic schools.

Robson

927

The First Amendment

Under the "contracts" authorized by the statute, the State directly reimburses
nonpublic schools solely for their actual expenditures for teachers' salaries,
textbooks, and instructional materials. A school seeking reimbursement must
maintain prescribed accounting procedures that identify the "separate" cost of
the "secular educational service." These accounts are subject to state audit. The
funds for this program were originally derived from a new tax on horse and
harness racing, but the Act is now financed by a portion of the state tax on
cigarettes.
There are several significant statutory restrictions on state aid. Reimbursement
is limited to courses "presented in the curricula of the public schools." It is
further limited "solely" to courses in the following "secular" subjects:
mathematics, modern foreign languages, physical science, and physical
education. Textbooks and instructional materials included in the program must
be approved by the state Superintendent of Public Instruction. Finally, the
statute prohibits reimbursement for any course that contains "any subject
matter expressing religious teaching, or the morals or forms of worship of any
sect."
The Act went into effect on July 1, 1968, and the first reimbursement payments
to schools were made on September 2, 1969. It appears that some $5 million
has been expended annually under the Act. The State has now entered into
contracts with some 1,181 nonpublic elementary and secondary schools with a
student population of some 535,215 pupils - more than 20% of the total
number of students in the State. More than 96% of these pupils attend churchrelated schools, and most of these schools are affiliated with the Roman
Catholic church.
Appellants brought this action in the District Court to challenge the
constitutionality of the Pennsylvania statute. The organizational plaintiffsappellants are associations of persons resident in Pennsylvania declaring belief
in the separation of church and state; individual plaintiffs-appellants are
citizens and taxpayers of Pennsylvania. Appellant Lemon, in addition to being a
citizen and a taxpayer, is a parent of a child attending public school in
Pennsylvania. Lemon also alleges that he purchased a ticket at a race track and
thus had paid the specific tax that supports the expenditures under the Act.
Appellees are state officials who have the responsibility for administering the
Act. In addition seven church-related schools are defendants-appellees.
A three-judge federal court ***held that the individual plaintiffs-appellants had
standing to challenge the Act. The organizational plaintiffs-appellants were
denied standing under Flast v. Cohen (1968).
The court granted appellees' motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state
a claim for relief. It held that the Act violated neither the Establishment nor the
Free Exercise Clause, Chief Judge Hastie dissenting. We reverse.
II
In Everson v. Board of Education (1947), this Court upheld a state statute that
reimbursed the parents of parochial school children for bus transportation
expenses. There JUSTICE BLACK, writing for the majority, suggested that the
decision carried to "the verge" of forbidden territory under the Religion Clauses.
Candor compels acknowledgment, moreover, that we can only dimly perceive

Robson

928

The First Amendment

the lines of demarcation in this extraordinarily sensitive area of constitutional
law.
The language of the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment is at best opaque,
particularly when compared with other portions of the Amendment. Its authors
did not simply prohibit the establishment of a state church or a state religion,
an area history shows they regarded as very important and fraught with great
dangers. Instead they commanded that there should be "no law respecting an
establishment of religion." A law may be one "respecting" the forbidden objective
while falling short of its total realization. A law "respecting" the proscribed
result, that is, the establishment of religion, is not always easily identifiable as
one violative of the Clause. A given law might not establish a state religion but
nevertheless be one "respecting" that end in the sense of being a step that could
lead to such establishment and hence offend the First Amendment.
In the absence of precisely stated constitutional prohibitions, we must draw
lines with reference to the three main evils against which the Establishment
Clause was intended to afford protection: "sponsorship, financial support, and
active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity." Walz v. Tax Commission
(1970).
Every analysis in this area must begin with consideration of the cumulative
criteria developed by the Court over many years. Three such tests may be
gleaned from our cases. First, the statute must have a secular legislative
purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither
advances nor inhibits religion, Board of Education v. Allen (1968); finally, the
statute must not foster "an excessive government entanglement with religion."
Walz.
Inquiry into the legislative purposes of the Pennsylvania and Rhode Island
statutes affords no basis for a conclusion that the legislative intent was to
advance religion. On the contrary, the statutes themselves clearly state that
they are intended to enhance the quality of the secular education in all schools
covered by the compulsory attendance laws. There is no reason to believe the
legislatures meant anything else. A State always has a legitimate concern for
maintaining minimum standards in all schools it allows to operate. ***
The legislatures of Rhode Island and Pennsylvania have concluded that secular
and religious education are identifiable and separable. In the abstract we have
no quarrel with this conclusion.
The two legislatures, however, have also recognized that church-related
elementary and secondary schools have a significant religious mission and that
a substantial portion of their activities is religiously oriented. They have
therefore sought to create statutory restrictions designed to guarantee the
separation between secular and religious educational functions and to ensure
that State financial aid supports only the former. All these provisions are
precautions taken in candid recognition that these programs approached, even
if they did not intrude upon, the forbidden areas under the Religion Clauses.
We need not decide whether these legislative precautions restrict the principal
or primary effect of the programs to the point where they do not offend the
Religion Clauses, for we conclude that the cumulative impact of the entire

Robson

929

The First Amendment

relationship arising under the statutes in each State involves excessive
entanglement between government and religion.
III
In Walz v. Tax Commission (1970) the Court upheld state tax exemptions for
real property owned by religious organizations and used for religious worship.
That holding, however, tended to confine rather than enlarge the area of
permissible state involvement with religious institutions by calling for close
scrutiny of the degree of entanglement involved in the relationship. The
objective is to prevent, as far as possible, the intrusion of either into the
precincts of the other.
Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state;
total separation is not possible in an absolute sense. Some relationship between
government and religious organizations is inevitable. Fire inspections, building
and zoning regulations, and state requirements under compulsory schoolattendance laws are examples of necessary and permissible contacts. Indeed,
under the statutory exemption before us in Walz, the State had a continuing
burden to ascertain that the exempt property was in fact being used for
religious worship. Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that
the line of separation, far from being a "wall," is a blurred, indistinct, and
variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship.
This is not to suggest, however, that we are to engage in a legalistic minuet in
which precise rules and forms must govern. A true minuet is a matter of pure
form and style, the observance of which is itself the substantive end. Here we
examine the form of the relationship for the light that it casts on the substance.
In order to determine whether the government entanglement with religion is
excessive, we must examine the character and purposes of the institutions that
are benefited, the nature of the aid that the State provides, and the resulting
relationship between the government and the religious authority. *** Here we
find that both statutes foster an impermissible degree of entanglement.
(a) Rhode Island program
The District Court made extensive findings on the grave potential for excessive
entanglement that inheres in the religious character and purpose of the Roman
Catholic elementary schools of Rhode Island, to date the sole beneficiaries of
the Rhode Island Salary Supplement Act.
The church schools involved in the program are located close to parish
churches. This understandably permits convenient access for religious
exercises since instruction in faith and morals is part of the total educational
process. The school buildings contain identifying religious symbols such as
crosses on the exterior and crucifixes, and religious paintings and statues
either in the classrooms or hallways. Although only approximately 30 minutes a
day are devoted to direct religious instruction, there are religiously oriented
extracurricular activities. Approximately two-thirds of the teachers in these
schools are nuns of various religious orders. Their dedicated efforts provide an
atmosphere in which religious instruction and religious vocations are natural
and proper parts of life in such schools. Indeed, as the District Court found, the
role of teaching nuns in enhancing the religious atmosphere has led the

Robson

930

The First Amendment

parochial school authorities to attempt to maintain a one-to-one ratio between
nuns and lay teachers in all schools rather than to permit some to be staffed
almost entirely by lay teachers.
On the basis of these findings the District Court concluded that the parochial
schools constituted "an integral part of the religious mission of the Catholic
Church." The various characteristics of the schools make them "a powerful
vehicle for transmitting the Catholic faith to the next generation." This process
of inculcating religious doctrine is, of course, enhanced by the impressionable
age of the pupils, in primary schools particularly. In short, parochial schools
involve substantial religious activity and purpose.
The substantial religious character of these church-related schools gives rise to
entangling church-state relationships of the kind the Religion Clauses sought to
avoid. Although the District Court found that concern for religious values did
not inevitably or necessarily intrude into the content of secular subjects, the
considerable religious activities of these schools led the legislature to provide for
careful governmental controls and surveillance by state authorities in order to
ensure that state aid supports only secular education.
The dangers and corresponding entanglements are enhanced by the particular
form of aid that the Rhode Island Act provides. Our decisions from Everson to
Allen have permitted the States to provide church-related schools with secular,
neutral, or nonideological services, facilities, or materials. Bus transportation,
school lunches, public health services, and secular textbooks supplied in
common to all students were not thought to offend the Establishment Clause.
We note that the dissenters in Allen seemed chiefly concerned with the
pragmatic difficulties involved in ensuring the truly secular content of the
textbooks provided at state expense.
In Allen the Court refused to make assumptions, on a meager record, about the
religious content of the textbooks that the State would be asked to provide. We
cannot, however, refuse here to recognize that teachers have a substantially
different ideological character from books. In terms of potential for involving
some aspect of faith or morals in secular subjects, a textbook's content is
ascertainable, but a teacher's handling of a subject is not. We cannot ignore the
danger that a teacher under religious control and discipline poses to the
separation of the religious from the purely secular aspects of pre-college
education. The conflict of functions inheres in the situation.
In our view the record shows these dangers are present to a substantial degree.
The Rhode Island Roman Catholic elementary schools are under the general
supervision of the Bishop of Providence and his appointed representative, the
Diocesan Superintendent of Schools. In most cases, each individual parish,
however, assumes the ultimate financial responsibility for the school, with the
parish priest authorizing the allocation of parish funds. ***
The teacher is employed by a religious organization, subject to the direction and
discipline of religious authorities, and works in a system dedicated to rearing
children in a particular faith. These controls are not lessened by the fact that
most of the lay teachers are of the Catholic faith. Inevitably some of a teacher's
responsibilities hover on the border between secular and religious orientation.

Robson

931

The First Amendment

We need not and do not assume that teachers in parochial schools will be guilty
of bad faith or any conscious design to evade the limitations imposed by the
statute and the First Amendment. We simply recognize that a dedicated
religious person, teaching in a school affiliated with his or her faith and
operated to inculcate its tenets, will inevitably experience great difficulty in
remaining religiously neutral. Doctrines and faith are not inculcated or
advanced by neutrals. With the best of intentions such a teacher would find it
hard to make a total separation between secular teaching and religious doctrine.
What would appear to some to be essential to good citizenship might well for
others border on or constitute instruction in religion. Further difficulties are
inherent in the combination of religious discipline and the possibility of
disagreement between teacher and religious authorities over the meaning of the
statutory restrictions.
We do not assume, however, that parochial school teachers will be unsuccessful
in their attempts to segregate their religious beliefs from their secular
educational responsibilities. But the potential for impermissible fostering of
religion is present. The Rhode Island Legislature has not, and could not, provide
state aid on the basis of a mere assumption that secular teachers under
religious discipline can avoid conflicts. The State must be certain, given the
Religion Clauses, that subsidized teachers do not inculcate religion - indeed the
State here has undertaken to do so. To ensure that no trespass occurs, the
State has therefore carefully conditioned its aid with pervasive restrictions. An
eligible recipient must teach only those courses that are offered in the public
schools and use only those texts and materials that are found in the public
schools. In addition the teacher must not engage in teaching any course in
religion.
A comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance will
inevitably be required to ensure that these restrictions are obeyed and the First
Amendment otherwise respected. Unlike a book, a teacher cannot be inspected
once so as to determine the extent and intent of his or her personal beliefs and
subjective acceptance of the limitations imposed by the First Amendment.
These prophylactic contacts will involve excessive and enduring entanglement
between state and church
There is another area of entanglement in the Rhode Island program that gives
concern. The statute excludes teachers employed by nonpublic schools whose
average per-pupil expenditures on secular education equal or exceed the
comparable figures for public schools. In the event that the total expenditures
of an otherwise eligible school exceed this norm, the program requires the
government to examine the school's records in order to determine how much of
the total expenditures is attributable to secular education and how much to
religious activity. This kind of state inspection and evaluation of the religious
content of a religious organization is fraught with the sort of entanglement that
the Constitution forbids. It is a relationship pregnant with dangers of excessive
government direction of church schools and hence of churches. ***
(b) Pennsylvania program
The Pennsylvania statute also provides state aid to church-related schools for
teachers' salaries. The complaint describes an educational system that is very

Robson

932

The First Amendment

similar to the one existing in Rhode Island. According to the allegations, the
church-related elementary and secondary schools are controlled by religious
organizations, have the purpose of propagating and promoting a particular
religious faith, and conduct their operations to fulfill that purpose. Since this
complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim for relief, we must accept
these allegations as true for purposes of our review.
As we noted earlier, the very restrictions and surveillance necessary to ensure
that teachers play a strictly nonideological role give rise to entanglements
between church and state. The Pennsylvania statute, like that of Rhode Island,
fosters this kind of relationship. Reimbursement is not only limited to courses
offered in the public schools and materials approved by state officials, but the
statute excludes "any subject matter expressing religious teaching, or the
morals or forms of worship of any sect." In addition, schools seeking
reimbursement must maintain accounting procedures that require the State to
establish the cost of the secular as distinguished from the religious instruction.
The Pennsylvania statute, moreover, has the further defect of providing state
financial aid directly to the church-related school. ***
The history of government grants of a continuing cash subsidy indicates that
such programs have almost always been accompanied by varying measures of
control and surveillance. The government cash grants before us now provide no
basis for predicting that comprehensive measures of surveillance and controls
will not follow. In particular the government's post-audit power to inspect and
evaluate a church-related school's financial records and to determine which
expenditures are religious and which are secular creates an intimate and
continuing relationship between church and state.
IV
A broader base of entanglement of yet a different character is presented by the
divisive political potential of these state programs. In a community where such
a large number of pupils are served by church-related schools, it can be
assumed that state assistance will entail considerable political activity.
Partisans of parochial schools, understandably concerned with rising costs and
sincerely dedicated to both the religious and secular educational missions of
their schools, will inevitably champion this cause and promote political action
to achieve their goals. Those who oppose state aid, whether for constitutional,
religious, or fiscal reasons, will inevitably respond and employ all of the usual
political campaign techniques to prevail. Candidates will be forced to declare
and voters to choose. It would be unrealistic to ignore the fact that many people
confronted with issues of this kind will find their votes aligned with their faith.
Ordinarily political debate and division, however vigorous or even partisan, are
normal and healthy manifestations of our democratic system of government,
but political division along religious lines was one of the principal evils against
which the First Amendment was intended to protect. The potential divisiveness
of such conflict is a threat to the normal political process. To have States or
communities divide on the issues presented by state aid to parochial schools
would tend to confuse and obscure other issues of great urgency. We have an
expanding array of vexing issues, local and national, domestic and international,
to debate and divide on. It conflicts with our whole history and tradition to

Robson

933

The First Amendment

permit questions of the Religion Clauses to assume such importance in our
legislatures and in our elections that they could divert attention from the
myriad issues and problems that confront every level of government. The
highways of church and state relationships are not likely to be one-way streets,
and the Constitution's authors sought to protect religious worship from the
pervasive power of government. The history of many countries attests to the
hazards of religion's intruding into the political arena or of political power
intruding into the legitimate and free exercise of religious belief.
*** The potential for political divisiveness related to religious belief and practice
is aggravated in these two statutory programs by the need for continuing
annual appropriations and the likelihood of larger and larger demands as costs
and populations grow. The Rhode Island District Court found that the parochial
school system's "monumental and deepening financial crisis" would
"inescapably" require larger annual appropriations subsidizing greater
percentages of the salaries of lay teachers. Although no facts have been
developed in this respect in the Pennsylvania case, it appears that such
pressures for expanding aid have already required the state legislature to
include a portion of the state revenues from cigarette taxes in the program.
V
In Walz it was argued that a tax exemption for places of religious worship would
prove to be the first step in an inevitable progression leading to the
establishment of state churches and state religion. That claim could not stand
up against more than 200 years of virtually universal practice imbedded in our
colonial experience and continuing into the present.
The progression argument, however, is more persuasive here. We have no long
history of state aid to church-related educational institutions comparable to
200 years of tax exemption for churches. Indeed, the state programs before us
today represent something of an innovation. We have already noted that
modern governmental programs have self-perpetuating and self-expanding
propensities. These internal pressures are only enhanced when the schemes
involve institutions whose legitimate needs are growing and whose interests
have substantial political support. Nor can we fail to see that in constitutional
adjudication some steps, which when taken were thought to approach "the
verge," have become the platform for yet further steps. A certain momentum
develops in constitutional theory and it can be a "downhill thrust" easily set in
motion but difficult to retard or stop. Development by momentum is not
invariably bad; indeed, it is the way the common law has grown, but it is a force
to be recognized and reckoned with. The dangers are increased by the difficulty
of perceiving in advance exactly where the "verge" of the precipice lies. As well
as constituting an independent evil against which the Religion Clauses were
intended to protect, involvement or entanglement between government and
religion serves as a warning signal.
Finally, nothing we have said can be construed to disparage the role of churchrelated elementary and secondary schools in our national life. Their
contribution has been and is enormous. Nor do we ignore their economic plight
in a period of rising costs and expanding need. Taxpayers generally have been
spared vast sums by the maintenance of these educational institutions by
religious organizations, largely by the gifts of faithful adherents.

Robson

934

The First Amendment

The merit and benefits of these schools, however, are not the issue before us in
these cases. The sole question is whether state aid to these schools can be
squared with the dictates of the Religion Clauses. Under our system the choice
has been made that government is to be entirely excluded from the area of
religious instruction and churches excluded from the affairs of government. The
Constitution decrees that religion must be a private matter for the individual,
the family, and the institutions of private choice, and that while some
involvement and entanglement are inevitable, lines must be drawn.
The judgment of the Rhode Island District Court in No. 569 and No. 570 is
affirmed. The judgment of the Pennsylvania District Court in No. 89 is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
JUSTICE DOUGLAS, WHOM JUSTICE BLACK JOINS, CONCURRING.
*** Yet in spite of this long and consistent history there are those who have the
courage to announce that a State may nonetheless finance the secular part of a
sectarian school's educational program. That, however, makes a grave
constitutional decision turn merely on cost accounting and bookkeeping entries.
A history class, a literature class, or a science class in a parochial school is not
a separate institute; it is part of the organic whole which the State subsidizes.
The funds are used in these cases to pay or help pay the salaries of teachers in
parochial schools; and the presence of teachers is critical to the essential
purpose of the parochial school, viz., to advance the religious endeavors of the
particular church. It matters not that the teacher receiving taxpayers' money
only teaches religion a fraction of the time. Nor does it matter that he or she
teaches no religion. The school is an organism living on one budget. What the
taxpayers give for salaries of those who teach only the humanities or science
without any trace of proselytizing enables the school to use all of its own funds
for religious training. ***
In my view the taxpayers' forced contribution to the parochial schools in the
present cases violates the First Amendment.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, CONCURRING [OMITTED]
JUSTICE WHITE, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENTS IN NO. 153 AND NO. 89 AND
DISSENTING IN NOS. 569 AND 570.
It is our good fortune that the States of this country long ago recognized that
instruction of the young and old ranks high on the scale of proper governmental
functions and not only undertook secular education as a public responsibility
but also required compulsory attendance at school by their young. Having
recognized the value of educated citizens and assumed the task of educating
them, the States now before us assert a right to provide for the secular
education of children whether they attend public schools or choose to enter
private institutions, even when those institutions are church-related. ***
But, while the decision of the Court is legitimate, it is surely quite wrong in
overturning the Pennsylvania and Rhode Island statutes on the ground that
they amount to an establishment of religion forbidden by the First Amendment.

The First Amendment

No one in these cases questions the constitutional right of parents to satisfy
their state-imposed obligation to educate their children by sending them to
private schools, sectarian or otherwise, as long as those schools meet minimum
standards established for secular instruction. The States are not only permitted,
but required by the Constitution, to free students attending private schools
from any public school attendance obligation. Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925).
The States may also furnish transportation for students, Everson v. Board of
Education (1947), and books for teaching secular subjects to students attending
parochial and other private as well as public schools, Board of Education v.
Allen (1968); we have also upheld arrangements whereby students are released
from public school classes so that they may attend religious instruction. Zorach
v. Clauson (1952). Outside the field of education, we have upheld Sunday
closing laws, McGowan v. Maryland (1961), state and federal laws exempting
church property and church activity from taxation, Walz v. Tax Commission
(1970), and governmental grants to religious organizations for the purpose of
financing improvements in the facilities of hospitals managed and controlled by
religious orders, Bradfield v. Roberts (1899).
Our prior cases have recognized the dual role of parochial schools in American
society: they perform both religious and secular functions. ***
It is enough for me that the States and the Federal Government are financing a
separable secular function of overriding importance in order to sustain the
legislation here challenged. That religion and private interests other than
education may substantially benefit does not convert these laws into
impermissible establishments of religion.
*** The Court thus creates an insoluble paradox for the State and the parochial
schools. The State cannot finance secular instruction if it permits religion to be
taught in the same classroom; but if it exacts a promise that religion not be so
taught - a promise the school and its teachers are quite willing and on this
record able to give - and enforces it, it is then entangled in the "no
entanglement" aspect of the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence. ***

Notes	  
1.
Lemon v. Kurtzman is the source of what becomes known as the
Lemon Test for Establishment Clause challenges, both within the
educational realm and in the “public square” as discussed in the next
chapter. Be sure that you can articulate the Lemon test.
2.
There are many critiques of the Lemon Test, including Justice
White’s criticism that it sets up an “insoluble paradox” in the
entanglement prong. Is one answer to this criticism the observation by
Justice Jackson in Everson that religious schools (and presumably other
entities) want it “both ways”?

Does the Lemon test cause you to reconsider Everson? Pierce v.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
School principals in the public school system of the city of Providence, Rhode
Island, are permitted to invite members of the clergy to offer invocation and
benediction prayers as part of the formal graduation ceremonies for middle
schools and for high schools. The question before us is whether including
clerical members who offer prayers as part of the official school graduation
ceremony is consistent with the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment,
provisions the Fourteenth Amendment makes applicable with full force to the
States and their school districts.
I
A
Deborah Weisman graduated from Nathan Bishop Middle School, a public
school in Providence, at a formal ceremony in June, 1989. She was about 14
years old. For many years, it has been the policy of the Providence School
Committee and the Superintendent of Schools to permit principals to invite
members of the clergy to give invocations and benedictions at middle school
and high school graduations. Many, but not all, of the principals elected to
include prayers as part of the graduation ceremonies. Acting for himself and his
daughter, Deborah's father, Daniel Weisman, objected to any prayers at
Deborah's middle school graduation, but to no avail. The school principal,
petitioner Robert E. Lee, invited a rabbi to deliver prayers at the graduation
exercises for Deborah's class. Rabbi Leslie Gutterman, of the Temple Beth El in
Providence, accepted.
It has been the custom of Providence school officials to provide invited clergy
with a pamphlet entitled "Guidelines for Civic Occasions," prepared by the
National Conference of Christians and Jews. The Guidelines recommend that
public prayers at nonsectarian civic ceremonies be composed with
"inclusiveness and sensitivity," though they acknowledge that "[p]rayer of any
kind may be inappropriate on some civic occasions." The principal gave Rabbi
Gutterman the pamphlet before the graduation, and advised him the invocation
and benediction should be nonsectarian.
Rabbi Gutterman's prayers were as follows:
"INVOCATION

"God of the Free, Hope of the Brave:
"For the legacy of America where diversity is celebrated and the rights of
minorities are protected, we thank You. May these young men and women grow

"For the liberty of America, we thank You. May these new graduates grow up to
guard it.
"For the political process of America in which all its citizens may participate, for
its court system where all may seek justice, we thank You. May those we honor
this morning always turn to it in trust.
"For the destiny of America, we thank You. May the graduates of Nathan Bishop
Middle School so live that they might help to share it.
"May our aspirations for our country and for these young people, who are our
hope for the future, be richly fulfilled.
AMEN"
"BENEDICTION
"O God, we are grateful to You for having endowed us with the capacity for
learning which we have celebrated on this joyous commencement.
"Happy families give thanks for seeing their children achieve an important
milestone. Send Your blessings upon the teachers and administrators who
helped prepare them.
"The graduates now need strength and guidance for the future; help them to
understand that we are not complete with academic knowledge alone. We must
each strive to fulfill what You require of us all: to do justly, to love mercy, to
walk humbly.
"We give thanks to You, Lord, for keeping us alive, sustaining us, and allowing
us to reach this special, happy occasion.
AMEN"

The record in this case is sparse in many respects, and we are unfamiliar with
any fixed custom or practice at middle school graduations, referred to by the
school district as "promotional exercises." We are not so constrained with
reference to high schools, however. High school graduations are such an
integral part of American cultural life that we can with confidence describe their
customary features, confirmed by aspects of the record and by the parties'
representations at oral argument. In the Providence school system, most high
school graduation ceremonies are conducted away from the school, while most
middle school ceremonies are held on school premises. Classical High School,
which Deborah now attends, has conducted its graduation ceremonies on
school premises. The parties stipulate that attendance at graduation
ceremonies is voluntary. The graduating students enter as a group in a
processional, subject to the direction of teachers and school officials, and sit
together, apart from their families. We assume the clergy's participation in any
high school graduation exercise would be about what it was at Deborah's
middle school ceremony. There the students stood for the Pledge of Allegiance
and remained standing during the rabbi's prayers. Even on the assumption that
there was a respectful moment of silence both before and after the prayers, the
rabbi's two presentations must not have extended much beyond a minute each,
if that. We do not know whether he remained on stage during the whole
ceremony, or whether the students received individual diplomas on stage, or if
he helped to congratulate them.

Robson

938

The First Amendment

The school board (and the United States, which supports it as amicus curiae)
argued that these short prayers and others like them at graduation exercises
are of profound meaning to many students and parents throughout this
country who consider that due respect and acknowledgment for divine guidance
and for the deepest spiritual aspirations of our people ought to be expressed at
an event as important in life as a graduation. We assume this to be so in
addressing the difficult case now before us, for the significance of the prayers
lies also at the heart of Daniel and Deborah Weisman's case.
B
Deborah's graduation was held on the premises of Nathan Bishop Middle
School on June 29, 1989. Four days before the ceremony, Daniel Weisman, in
his individual capacity as a Providence taxpayer and as next friend of Deborah,
sought a temporary restraining order in the United States District Court for the
District of Rhode Island to prohibit school officials from including an invocation
or benediction in the graduation ceremony. The court denied the motion for
lack of adequate time to consider it. Deborah and her family attended the
graduation, where the prayers were recited. In July, 1989, Daniel Weisman filed
an amended complaint seeking a permanent injunction barring petitioners,
various officials of the Providence public schools, from inviting the clergy to
deliver invocations and benedictions at future graduations. We find it
unnecessary to address Daniel Weisman's taxpayer standing, for a live and
justiciable controversy is before us. Deborah Weisman is enrolled as a student
at Classical High School in Providence and from the record it appears likely, if
not certain, that an invocation and benediction will be conducted at her high
school graduation.
The case was submitted on stipulated facts. The District Court held that
petitioners' practice of including invocations and benedictions in public school
graduations violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and it
enjoined petitioners from continuing the practice. The court applied the threepart Establishment Clause test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971). Under
that test as described in our past cases, to satisfy the Establishment Clause, a
governmental practice must (1) reflect a clearly secular purpose; (2) have a
primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion; and (3) avoid
excessive government entanglement with religion. The District Court held that
petitioners' actions violated the second part of the test, and so did not address
either the first or the third. ***
On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. The
majority opinion by Judge Torruella adopted the opinion of the District Court.
Judge Bownes joined the majority, but wrote a separate concurring opinion in
which he decided that the practices challenged here violated all three parts of
the Lemon test. *** He concluded by suggesting that, under Establishment
Clause rules, no prayer, even one excluding any mention of the Deity, could be
offered at a public school graduation ceremony. Judge Campbell dissented***
[and] reasoned that, if the prayers delivered were nonsectarian, and if school
officials ensured that persons representing a variety of beliefs and ethical
systems were invited to present invocations and benedictions, there was no
violation of the Establishment Clause. We granted certiorari and now affirm.

Robson

939

The First Amendment

II
These dominant facts mark and control the confines of our decision: State
officials direct the performance of a formal religious exercise at promotional and
graduation ceremonies for secondary schools. Even for those students who
object to the religious exercise, their attendance and participation in the statesponsored religious activity are, in a fair and real sense, obligatory, though the
school district does not require attendance as a condition for receipt of the
diploma.
This case does not require us to revisit the difficult questions dividing us in
recent cases, questions of the definition and full scope of the principles
governing the extent of permitted accommodation by the State for the religious
beliefs and practices of many of its citizens. For without reference to those
principles in other contexts, the controlling precedents as they relate to prayer
and religious exercise in primary and secondary public schools compel the
holding here that the policy of the city of Providence is an unconstitutional one.
We can decide the case without reconsidering the general constitutional
framework by which public schools' efforts to accommodate religion are
measured. Thus, we do not accept the invitation of petitioners and amicus the
United States to reconsider our decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman. The government
involvement with religious activity in this case is pervasive, to the point of
creating a state-sponsored and state-directed religious exercise in a public
school. Conducting this formal religious observance conflicts with settled rules
pertaining to prayer exercises for students, and that suffices to determine the
question before us.
The principle that government may accommodate the free exercise of religion
does not supersede the fundamental limitations imposed by the Establishment
Clause. It is beyond dispute that, at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees
that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or
its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which "establishes a [state] religion or
religious faith, or tends to do so." The State's involvement in the school prayers
challenged today violates these central principles.
That involvement is as troubling as it is undenied. A school official, the
principal, decided that an invocation and a benediction should be given; this is
a choice attributable to the State, and, from a constitutional perspective, it is as
if a state statute decreed that the prayers must occur. The principal chose the
religious participant, here a rabbi, and that choice is also attributable to the
State. The reason for the choice of a rabbi is not disclosed by the record, but
the potential for divisiveness over the choice of a particular member of the
clergy to conduct the ceremony is apparent.
Divisiveness, of course, can attend any state decision respecting religions, and
neither its existence nor its potential necessarily invalidates the State's
attempts to accommodate religion in all cases. The potential for divisiveness is
of particular relevance here, though, because it centers around an overt
religious exercise in a secondary school environment where subtle coercive
pressures exist, and where the student had no real alternative which would
have allowed her to avoid the fact or appearance of participation.

Robson

940

The First Amendment

The State's role did not end with the decision to include a prayer and with the
choice of clergyman. Principal Lee provided Rabbi Gutterman with a copy of the
"Guidelines for Civic Occasions" and advised him that his prayers should be
nonsectarian. Through these means, the principal directed and controlled the
content of the prayers. Even if the only sanction for ignoring the instructions
were that the rabbi would not be invited back, we think no religious
representative who valued his or her continued reputation and effectiveness in
the community would incur the State's displeasure in this regard. It is a
cornerstone principle of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence that it is no
part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of
the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by
government, Engel v. Vitale (1962), and that is what the school officials
attempted to do.
Petitioners argue, and we find nothing in the case to refute it, that the
directions for the content of the prayers were a good-faith attempt by the school
to ensure that the sectarianism which is so often the flashpoint for religious
animosity be removed from the graduation ceremony. The concern is
understandable, as a prayer which uses ideas or images identified with a
particular religion may foster a different sort of sectarian rivalry than an
invocation or benediction in terms more neutral. The school's explanation,
however, does not resolve the dilemma caused by its participation. The question
is not the good faith of the school in attempting to make the prayer acceptable
to most persons, but the legitimacy of its undertaking that enterprise at all
when the object is to produce a prayer to be used in a formal religious exercise
which students, for all practical purposes are obliged to attend.
We are asked to recognize the existence of a practice of nonsectarian prayer,
prayer within the embrace of what is known as the Judeo-Christian tradition,
prayer which is more acceptable than one which, for example, makes explicit
references to the God of Israel, or to Jesus Christ, or to a patron saint. There
may be some support, as an empirical observation *** that there has emerged
in this country a civic religion, one which is tolerated when sectarian exercises
are not. If common ground can be defined which permits once conflicting faiths
to express the shared conviction that there is an ethic and a morality which
transcend human invention, the sense of community and purpose sought by all
decent societies might be advanced. But though the First Amendment does not
allow the government to stifle prayers which aspire to these ends, neither does
it permit the government to undertake that task for itself.
The First Amendment's Religion Clauses mean that religious beliefs and
religious expression are too precious to be either proscribed or prescribed by
the State. The design of the Constitution is that preservation and transmission
of religious beliefs and worship is a responsibility and a choice committed to the
private sphere, which itself is promised freedom to pursue that mission. It must
not be forgotten, then, that, while concern must be given to define the
protection granted to an objector or a dissenting nonbeliever, these same
Clauses exist to protect religion from government interference. James Madison,
the principal author of the Bill of Rights, did not rest his opposition to a
religious establishment on the sole ground of its effect on the minority. A
principal ground for his view was: [E]xperience witnesseth that ecclesiastical

Robson

941

The First Amendment

establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of Religion, have
had a contrary operation. Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious
Assessments (1785).
These concerns have particular application in the case of school officials, whose
effort to monitor prayer will be perceived by the students as inducing a
participation they might otherwise reject. Though the efforts of the school
officials in this case to find common ground appear to have been a good faith
attempt to recognize the common aspects of religions, and not the divisive ones,
our precedents do not permit school officials to assist in composing prayers as
an incident to a formal exercise for their students. Engel v. Vitale. And these
same precedents caution us to measure the idea of a civic religion against the
central meaning of the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, which is that
all creeds must be tolerated, and none favored. The suggestion that government
may establish an official or civic religion as a means of avoiding the
establishment of a religion with more specific creeds strikes us as a
contradiction that cannot be accepted.
The degree of school involvement here made it clear that the graduation prayers
bore the imprint of the State, and thus put school-age children who objected in
an untenable position. We turn our attention now to consider the position of the
students, both those who desired the prayer and she who did not.
*** The lessons of the First Amendment are as urgent in the modern world as
in the 18th century, when it was written. One timeless lesson is that, if citizens
are subjected to state-sponsored religious exercises, the State disavows its own
duty to guard and respect that sphere of inviolable conscience and belief which
is the mark of a free people. To compromise that principle today would be to
deny our own tradition and forfeit our standing to urge others to secure the
protections of that tradition for themselves.
As we have observed before, there are heightened concerns with protecting
freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and
secondary public schools. Our decisions recognize that prayer exercises in
public schools carry a particular risk of indirect coercion. The concern may not
be limited to the context of schools, but it is most pronounced there. What to
most believers may seem nothing more than a reasonable request that the
nonbeliever respect their religious practices, in a school context may appear to
the nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of the
State to enforce a religious orthodoxy.
We need not look beyond the circumstances of this case to see the phenomenon
at work. The undeniable fact is that the school district's supervision and control
of a high school graduation ceremony places public pressure, as well as peer
pressure, on attending students to stand as a group or, at least, maintain
respectful silence during the invocation and benediction. This pressure, though
subtle and indirect, can be as real as any overt compulsion. Of course, in our
culture, standing or remaining silent can signify adherence to a view or simple
respect for the views of others. And no doubt some persons who have no desire
to join a prayer have little objection to standing as a sign of respect for those
who do. But for the dissenter of high school age, who has a reasonable
perception that she is being forced by the State to pray in a manner her

Robson

942

The First Amendment

conscience will not allow, the injury is no less real. There can be no doubt that
for many, if not most, of the students at the graduation, the act of standing or
remaining silent was an expression of participation in the rabbi's prayer. That
was the very point of the religious exercise. It is of little comfort to a dissenter,
then, to be told that, for her, the act of standing or remaining in silence signifies
mere respect, rather than participation. What matters is that, given our social
conventions, a reasonable dissenter in this milieu could believe that the group
exercise signified her own participation or approval of it.
Finding no violation under these circumstances would place objectors in the
dilemma of participating, with all that implies, or protesting. We do not address
whether that choice is acceptable if the affected citizens are mature adults, but
we think the State may not, consistent with the Establishment Clause, place
primary and secondary school children in this position. Research in psychology
supports the common assumption that adolescents are often susceptible to
pressure from their peers towards conformity, and that the influence is
strongest in matters of social convention. Brittain, Adolescent Choices and
Parent-Peer Cross-Pressures, 28 Am. Sociological Rev. 385 (June 1963); Clasen
& Brown, The Multidimensionality of Peer Pressure in Adolescence, 14 J. of
Youth and Adolescence 451 (Dec. 1985); Brown, Clasen, & Eicher, Perceptions
of Peer Pressure, Peer Conformity Dispositions, and Self-Reported Behavior
Among Adolescents, 22 Developmental Psychology 521 (July 1986). To
recognize that the choice imposed by the State constitutes an unacceptable
constraint only acknowledges that the government may no more use social
pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use more direct means.
The injury caused by the government's action, and the reason why Daniel and
Deborah Weisman object to it, is that the State, in a school setting, in effect
required participation in a religious exercise. It is, we concede, a brief exercise
during which the individual can concentrate on joining its message, meditate
on her own religion, or let her mind wander. But the embarrassment and the
intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that these
prayers, and similar ones to be said in the future, are of a de minimis character.
To do so would be an affront to the rabbi who offered them and to all those for
whom the prayers were an essential and profound recognition of divine
authority. ***
The importance of the event is the point the school district and the United
States rely upon to argue that a formal prayer ought to be permitted, but it
becomes one of the principal reasons why their argument must fail. Their
contention, one of considerable force were it not for the constitutional
constraints applied to state action, is that the prayers are an essential part of
these ceremonies because, for many persons, an occasion of this significance
lacks meaning if there is no recognition, however brief, that human
achievements cannot be understood apart from their spiritual essence. We
think the Government's position that this interest suffices to force students to
choose between compliance or forfeiture demonstrates fundamental
inconsistency in its argumentation. It fails to acknowledge that what for many
of Deborah's classmates and their parents was a spiritual imperative was, for
Daniel and Deborah Weisman, religious conformance compelled by the State.
While in some societies the wishes of the majority might prevail, the

Robson

943

The First Amendment

Establishment Clause of the First Amendment is addressed to this contingency,
and rejects the balance urged upon us. The Constitution forbids the State to
exact religious conformity from a student as the price of attending her own high
school graduation. This is the calculus the Constitution commands.
The Government's argument gives insufficient recognition to the real conflict of
conscience faced by the young student. The essence of the Government's
position is that, with regard to a civic, social occasion of this importance, it is
the objector, not the majority, who must take unilateral and private action to
avoid compromising religious scruples, hereby electing to miss the graduation
exercise. This turns conventional First Amendment analysis on its head. It is a
tenet of the First Amendment that the State cannot require one of its citizens to
forfeit his or her rights and benefits as the price of resisting conformance to
state-sponsored religious practice. To say that a student must remain apart
from the ceremony at the opening invocation and closing benediction is to risk
compelling conformity in an environment analogous to the classroom setting,
where we have said the risk of compulsion is especially high. ***
We do not hold that every state action implicating religion is invalid if one or a
few citizens find it offensive. People may take offense at all manner of religious
as well as nonreligious messages, but offense alone does not in every case show
a violation. We know too that sometimes to endure social isolation or even
anger may be the price of conscience or nonconformity. But, by any reading of
our cases, the conformity required of the student in this case was too high an
exaction to withstand the test of the Establishment Clause. The prayer
exercises in this case are especially improper because the State has in every
practical sense compelled attendance and participation in an explicit religious
exercise at an event of singular importance to every student, one the objecting
student had no real alternative to avoid.
Our jurisprudence in this area is of necessity one of line-drawing, of
determining at what point a dissenter's rights of religious freedom are infringed
by the State. ***
Our society would be less than true to its heritage if it lacked abiding concern
for the values of its young people, and we acknowledge the profound belief of
adherents to many faiths that there must be a place in the student's life for
precepts of a morality higher even than the law we today enforce. We express no
hostility to those aspirations, nor would our oath permit us to do so. A
relentless and all-pervasive attempt to exclude religion from every aspect of
public life could itself become inconsistent with the Constitution. We recognize
that, at graduation time and throughout the course of the educational process,
there will be instances when religious values, religious practices, and religious
persons will have some interaction with the public schools and their students.
But these matters, often questions of accommodation of religion, are not before
us. The sole question presented is whether a religious exercise may be
conducted at a graduation ceremony in circumstances where, as we have found,
young graduates who object are induced to conform. No holding by this Court
suggests that a school can persuade or compel a student to participate in a
religious exercise. That is being done here, and it is forbidden by the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

For the reasons we have stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEVENS AND JUSTICE O'CONNOR JOIN,
CONCURRING.
Nearly half a century of review and refinement of Establishment Clause
jurisprudence has distilled one clear understanding: Government may neither
promote nor affiliate itself with any religious doctrine or organization, nor may
it obtrude itself in the internal affairs of any religious institution. The
application of these principles to the present case mandates the decision
reached today by the Court.
I
This Court first reviewed a challenge to state law under the Establishment
Clause in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing (1947). ***
The question then is whether the government has "plac[ed] its official stamp of
approval" on the prayer. As the Court ably demonstrates, when the government
"compose[s] official prayers," selects the member of the clergy to deliver the
prayer, has the prayer delivered at a public school event that is planned,
supervised, and given by school officials, and pressures students to attend and
participate in the prayer, there can be no doubt that the government is
advancing and promoting religion. As our prior decisions teach us, it is this that
the Constitution prohibits.
II
I join the Court's opinion today because I find nothing in it inconsistent with
the essential precepts of the Establishment Clause developed in our precedents.
The Court holds that the graduation prayer is unconstitutional because the
State "in effect required participation in a religious exercise." Although our
precedents make clear that proof of government coercion is not necessary to
prove an Establishment Clause violation, it is sufficient. Government pressure
to participate in a religious activity is an obvious indication that the government
is endorsing or promoting religion.
But it is not enough that the government restrain from compelling religious
practices: It must not engage in them either. The Court repeatedly has
recognized that a violation of the Establishment Clause is not predicated on
coercion. The Establishment Clause proscribes public schools from "conveying
or attempting to convey a message that religion or a particular religious belief is
favored or preferred," County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union,
Greater Pittsburg Chapter (1989), even if the schools do not actually "impos[e]
pressure upon a student to participate in a religious activity."
The scope of the Establishment Clause's prohibitions developed in our case law
derives from the Clause's purposes. The First Amendment encompasses two
distinct guarantees - the government shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof - both with the
common purpose of securing religious liberty. ***

Robson

945

The First Amendment

There is no doubt that attempts to aid religion through government coercion
jeopardize freedom of conscience. Even subtle pressure diminishes the right of
each individual to choose voluntarily what to believe. Representative Carroll
explained during congressional debate over the Establishment Clause: "[T]he
rights of conscience are, in their nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear
the gentlest touch of governmental hand." I ANNALS OF CONG. 757 (1789).
Our decisions have gone beyond prohibiting coercion, however, because the
Court has recognized that "the fullest possible scope of religious liberty," entails
more than freedom from coercion. The Establishment Clause protects religious
liberty on a grand scale; it is a social compact that guarantees for generations a
democracy and a strong religious community - both essential to safeguarding
religious liberty. "Our fathers seem to have been perfectly sincere in their belief
that the members of the Church would be more patriotic, and the citizens of the
State more religious, by keeping their respective functions entirely separate."
Religious Liberty, in ESSAYS AND SPEECHES OF JEREMIAH S. BLACK 53 (C. Black ed.
1885) (Chief Justice of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania).
The mixing of government and religion can be a threat to free government, even
if no one is forced to participate. When the government puts its imprimatur on
a particular religion, it conveys a message of exclusion to all those who do not
adhere to the favored beliefs. A government cannot be premised on the belief
that all persons are created equal when it asserts that God prefers some. ***
When the government arrogates to itself a role in religious affairs, it abandons
its obligation as guarantor of democracy. Democracy requires the nourishment
of dialog and dissent, while religious faith puts its trust in an ultimate divine
authority above all human deliberation. ***
Madison warned that government officials who would use religious authority to
pursue secular ends "exceed the commission from which they derive their
authority, and are Tyrants. The People who submit to it are governed by laws
made neither by themselves nor by an authority derived from them, and are
slaves." Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments (1785).
Democratic government will not last long when proclamation replaces
persuasion as the medium of political exchange.
Likewise, we have recognized that "[r]eligion flourishes in greater purity, without
than with the aid of Gov[ernment]." To "make room for as wide a variety of
beliefs and creeds as the spiritual needs of man deem necessary," Zorach v.
Clauson (1952), the government must not align itself with any one of them.
When the government favors a particular religion or sect, the disadvantage to
all others is obvious, but even the favored religion may fear being "taint[ed] . . .
with a corrosive secularism." The favored religion may be compromised as
political figures reshape the religion's beliefs for their own purposes; it may be
reformed as government largesse brings government regulation. Keeping
religion in the hands of private groups minimizes state intrusion on religious
choice, and best enables each religion to "flourish according to the zeal of its
adherents and the appeal of its dogma." Zorach.
It is these understandings and fears that underlie our Establishment Clause
jurisprudence. We have believed that religious freedom cannot exist in the
absence of a free democratic government, and that such a government cannot

Robson

946

The First Amendment

endure when there is fusion between religion and the political regime. We have
believed that religious freedom cannot thrive in the absence of a vibrant
religious community, and that such a community cannot prosper when it is
bound to the secular. And we have believed that these were the animating
principles behind the adoption of the Establishment Clause. To that end, our
cases have prohibited government endorsement of religion, its sponsorship, and
active involvement in religion, whether or not citizens were coerced to conform.
I remain convinced that our jurisprudence is not misguided, and that it
requires the decision reached by the Court today. Accordingly, I join the Court
in affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
JUSTICE SOUTER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEVENS AND JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JOIN,
CONCURRING.
I join the whole of the Court's opinion, and fully agree that prayers at public
school graduation ceremonies indirectly coerce religious observance. I write
separately nonetheless on two issues of Establishment Clause analysis that
underlie my independent resolution of this case: whether the Clause applies to
governmental practices that do not favor one religion or denomination over
others, and whether state coercion of religious conformity, over and above state
endorsement of religious exercise or belief, is a necessary element of an
Establishment Clause violation.
I
Forty-five years ago, this Court announced a basic principle of constitutional
law from which it has not strayed: the Establishment Clause forbids not only
state practices that "aid one religion . . . or prefer one religion over another," but
also those that "aid all religions." Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing (1947). Today
we reaffirm that principle, holding that the Establishment Clause forbids statesponsored prayers in public school settings no matter how nondenominational
the prayers may be. In barring the State from sponsoring generically theistic
prayers where it could not sponsor sectarian ones, we hold true to a line of
precedent from which there is no adequate historical case to depart.
A
Since Everson, we have consistently held the Clause applicable no less to
governmental acts favoring religion generally than to acts favoring one religion
over others. ***
B
Some have challenged this precedent by reading the Establishment Clause to
permit "nonpreferential" state promotion of religion. The challengers argue that,
as originally understood by the Framers, "[t]he Establishment Clause did not
require government neutrality between religion and irreligion, nor did it prohibit
the Federal Government from providing nondiscriminatory aid to religion."
Wallace (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). While a case has been made for this
position, it is not so convincing as to warrant reconsideration of our settled law;
indeed, I find in the history of the Clause's textual development a more powerful
argument supporting the Court's jurisprudence following Everson.

Robson

947

The First Amendment

*** Thus, on balance, history neither contradicts nor warrants reconsideration
of the settled principle that the Establishment Clause forbids support for
religion in general no less than support for one religion or some.
C
While these considerations are, for me, sufficient to reject the nonpreferentialist
position, one further concern animates my judgment. In many contexts,
including this one, nonpreferentialism requires some distinction between
"sectarian" religious practices and those that would be, by some measure,
ecumenical enough to pass Establishment Clause muster. Simply by requiring
the enquiry, nonpreferentialists invite the courts to engage in comparative
theology. I can hardly imagine a subject less amenable to the competence of the
federal judiciary, or more deliberately to be avoided where possible. ***
This case is nicely in point. ***
Nor does it solve the problem to say that the State should promote a "diversity"
of religious views; that position would necessarily compel the government and,
inevitably, the courts to make wholly inappropriate judgments about the
number of religions the State should sponsor and the relative frequency with
which it should sponsor each. In fact, the prospect would be even worse than
that. As Madison observed in criticizing religious presidential proclamations,
the practice of sponsoring religious messages tends, over time, "to narrow the
recommendation to the standard of the predominant sect." Madison's "Detached
Memoranda," 3 Wm. & Mary Q. 534, 561 (E. Fleet ed. 1946) (hereinafter
Madison's "Detached Memoranda"). We have not changed much since the days
of Madison, and the judiciary should not willingly enter the political arena to
battle the centripetal force leading from religious pluralism to official preference
for the faith with the most votes.
II
Petitioners rest most of their argument on a theory that, whether or not the
Establishment Clause permits extensive nonsectarian support for religion, it
does not forbid the state to sponsor affirmations of religious belief that coerce
neither support for religion nor participation in religious observance. I
appreciate the force of some of the arguments supporting a "coercion" analysis
of the Clause. But we could not adopt that reading without abandoning our
settled law, a course that, in my view, the text of the Clause would not readily
permit. Nor does the extratextual evidence of original meaning stand so
unequivocally at odds with the textual premise inherent in existing precedent
that we should fundamentally reconsider our course.
A
Over the years, this Court has declared the invalidity of many noncoercive state
laws and practices conveying a message of religious endorsement. For example,
in County of Allegheny, we forbade the prominent display of a nativity scene on
public property; without contesting the dissent's observation that the creche
coerced no one into accepting or supporting whatever message it proclaimed,
five Members of the Court found its display unconstitutional as a state
endorsement of Christianity. Likewise, in Wallace v. Jaffree (1985), we struck
down a state law requiring a moment of silence in public classrooms not
because the statute coerced students to participate in prayer (for it did not), but

Robson

948

The First Amendment

because the manner of its enactment "convey[ed] a message of state approval of
prayer activities in the public schools."
In Epperson v. Arkansas (1968), we invalidated a state law that barred the
teaching of Darwin's theory of evolution because, even though the statute
obviously did not coerce anyone to support religion or participate in any
religious practice, it was enacted for a singularly religious purpose. See also
Edwards v. Aguillard (1987) (statute requiring instruction in "creation science"
"endorses religion in violation of the First Amendment"). And in School Dist. of
Grand Rapids v. Ball (1985), we invalidated a program whereby the State sent
public school teachers to parochial schools to instruct students on ostensibly
nonreligious matters; while the scheme clearly did not coerce anyone to receive
or subsidize religious instruction, we held it invalid because, among other
things, "[t]he symbolic union of church and state inherent in the [program]
threatens to convey a message of state support for religion to students and to
the general public.
Our precedents may not always have drawn perfectly straight lines. They simply
cannot, however, support the position that a showing of coercion is necessary to
a successful Establishment Clause claim.
B
Like the provisions about "due" process and "unreasonable" searches and
seizures, the constitutional language forbidding laws "respecting an
establishment of religion" is not pellucid. But virtually everyone acknowledges
that the Clause bans more than formal establishments of religion in the
traditional sense, that is, massive state support for religion through, among
other means, comprehensive schemes of taxation. This much follows from the
Framers' explicit rejection of simpler provisions prohibiting either the
establishment of a religion or laws "establishing religion" in favor of the broader
ban on laws "respecting an establishment of religion."
While some argue that the Framers added the word "respecting" simply to
foreclose federal interference with state establishments of religion, the language
sweeps more broadly than that. In Madison's words, the Clause in its final form
forbids "everything like" a national religious establishment, see Madison's
"Detached Memoranda" and, after incorporation, it forbids "everything like" a
state religious establishment. The sweep is broad enough that Madison himself
characterized congressional provisions for legislative and military chaplains as
unconstitutional "establishments." Madison's "Detached Memoranda."
While petitioners insist that the prohibition extends only to the "coercive"
features and incident of establishment, they cannot easily square that claim
with the constitutional text. The First Amendment forbids not just laws
"respecting an establishment of religion," but also those "prohibiting the free
exercise thereof." Yet laws that coerce nonadherents to "support or participate
in any religion or its exercise," County of Allegheny (opinion of KENNEDY, J.),
would, virtually by definition, violate their right to religious free exercise. Thus,
a literal application of the coercion test would render the Establishment Clause
a virtual nullity, as petitioners' counsel essentially conceded at oral argument.
Our cases presuppose as much; *** While one may argue that the Framers
meant the Establishment Clause simply to ornament the First Amendment, that

Robson

949

The First Amendment

must be a reading of last resort. Without compelling evidence to the contrary,
we should presume that the Framers meant the Clause to stand for something
more than petitioners attribute to it.
C
Petitioners argue from the political setting in which the Establishment Clause
was framed, and from the Framers' own political practices following ratification,
that government may constitutionally endorse religion so long as it does not
coerce religious conformity. The setting and the practices warrant canvassing,
but while they yield some evidence for petitioners' argument, they do not reveal
the degree of consensus in early constitutional thought that would raise a
threat to stare decisis by challenging the presumption that the Establishment
Clause adds something to the Free Exercise Clause that follows it. ***
To be sure, the leaders of the young Republic engaged in some of the practices
that separationists like Jefferson and Madison criticized. The First Congress did
hire institutional chaplains, and Presidents Washington and Adams
unapologetically marked days of "`public thanksgiving and prayer.'" Yet in the
face of the separationist dissent, those practices prove, at best, that the
Framers simply did not share a common understanding of the Establishment
Clause, and, at worst, that they, like other politicians, could raise constitutional
ideals one day and turn their backs on them the next. "Indeed, by 1787, the
provisions of the state bills of rights had become what Madison called mere
"paper parchments" - expressions of the most laudable sentiments, observed as
much in the breach as in practice." Sometimes the National Constitution fared
no better. Ten years after proposing the First Amendment, Congress passed the
Alien and Sedition Acts, measures patently unconstitutional by modern
standards. If the early Congress's political actions were determinative, and not
merely relevant, evidence of constitutional meaning, we would have to gut our
current First Amendment doctrine to make room for political censor. While we
may be unable to know for certain what the Framers meant by the Clause, we
do know that, around the time of its ratification, a respectable body of opinion
supported a considerably broader reading than petitioners urge upon us. This
consistency with the textual considerations is enough to preclude
fundamentally reexamining our settled law, and I am accordingly left with the
task of considering whether the state practice at issue here violates our
traditional understanding of the Clause's proscriptions.
III
While the Establishment Clause's concept of neutrality is not self-revealing, our
recent cases have invested it with specific content: the State may not favor or
endorse either religion generally over nonreligion or one religion over others. ***
A
[omitted]
B
*** Religious students cannot complain that omitting prayers from their
graduation ceremony would, in any realistic sense, "burden" their spiritual
callings. To be sure, many of them invest this rite of passage with spiritual
significance, but they may express their religious feelings about it before and
after the ceremony. They may even organize a privately sponsored
baccalaureate if they desire the company of like-minded students. Because they

Robson

950

The First Amendment

accordingly have no need for the machinery of the State to affirm their beliefs,
the government's sponsorship of prayer at the graduation ceremony is most
reasonably understood as an official endorsement of religion and, in this
instance, of theistic religion. One may fairly say, as one commentator has
suggested, that the government brought prayer into the ceremony "precisely
because some people want a symbolic affirmation that government approves
and endorses their religion, and because many of the people who want this
affirmation place little or no value on the costs to religious minorities."
Petitioners would deflect this conclusion by arguing that graduation prayers are
no different from presidential religious proclamations and similar official
"acknowledgments" of religion in public life. But religious invocations in
Thanksgiving Day addresses and the like, rarely noticed, ignored without effort,
conveyed over an impersonal medium, and directed at no one in particular,
inhabit a pallid zone worlds apart from official prayers delivered to a captive
audience of public school students and their families. Madison himself
respected the difference between the trivial and the serious in constitutional
practice. Realizing that his contemporaries were unlikely to take the
Establishment Clause seriously enough to forgo a legislative chaplainship, he
suggested that, "[r]ather than let this step beyond the landmarks of power have
the effect of a legitimate precedent, it will be better to apply to it the legal
aphorism de minimis non curat lex. . . ." Madison's "Detached Memoranda"
559; see also Letter from J. Madison to E. Livingston (July 10, 1822). But that
logic permits no winking at the practice in question here. When public school
officials, armed with the State's authority, convey an endorsement of religion to
their students, they strike near the core of the Establishment Clause. However
"ceremonial" their messages may be, they are flatly unconstitutional.
JUSTICE SCALIA, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, AND JUSTICE
THOMAS JOIN, DISSENTING.
*** In holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits invocations and
benedictions at public school graduation ceremonies, the Court - with nary a
mention that it is doing so - lays waste a tradition that is as old as public
school graduation ceremonies themselves, and that is a component of an even
more longstanding American tradition of nonsectarian prayer to God at public
celebrations generally. As its instrument of destruction, the bulldozer of its
social engineering, the Court invents a boundless, and boundlessly manipulable,
test of psychological coercion, which promises to do for the Establishment
Clause what the Durham rule did for the insanity defense. Today's opinion
shows more forcefully than volumes of argumentation why our Nation's
protection, that fortress which is our Constitution, cannot possibly rest upon
the changeable philosophical predilections of the Justices of this Court, but
must have deep foundations in the historic practices of our people.
I
Justice Holmes' aphorism that "a page of history is worth a volume of logic,"
New York Trust Co. v. Eisner (1921), applies with particular force to our
Establishment Clause jurisprudence. ***
The history and tradition of our Nation are replete with public ceremonies
featuring prayers of thanksgiving and petition. Illustrations of this point have

Robson

951

The First Amendment

been amply provided in our prior opinions, but since the Court is so oblivious to
our history as to suggest that the Constitution restricts "preservation and
transmission of religious beliefs . . . to the private sphere," it appears necessary
to provide another brief account.
From our Nation's origin, prayer has been a prominent part of governmental
ceremonies and proclamations. ***
In addition to this general tradition of prayer at public ceremonies, there exists
a more specific tradition of invocations and benedictions at public school
graduation exercises. By one account, the first public high school graduation
ceremony took place in Connecticut in July 1868 - the very month, as it
happens, that the Fourteenth Amendment (the vehicle by which the
Establishment Clause has been applied against the States) was ratified - when
"15 seniors from the Norwich Free Academy marched in their best Sunday suits
and dresses into a church hall and waited through majestic music and long
prayers." Brodinsky, Commencement Rites Obsolete? Not At All, A 10 Week Study
Shows, 10 Updating School Board Policies, No. 4, p. 3 (Apr. 1979). As the Court
obliquely acknowledges in describing the "customary features" of high school
graduations, and as respondents do not contest, the invocation and benediction
have long been recognized to be "as traditional as any other parts of the [school]
graduation program and are widely established."
II
The Court presumably would separate graduation invocations and benedictions
from other instances of public "preservation and transmission of religious
beliefs" on the ground that they involve "psychological coercion." ***
The Court identifies two "dominant facts" that it says dictate its ruling that
invocations and benedictions at public school graduation ceremonies violate the
Establishment Clause. Neither of them is, in any relevant sense, true.
A
The Court declares that students' "attendance and participation in the
[invocation and benediction] are, in a fair and real sense, obligatory." But what
exactly is this "fair and real sense"? According to the Court, students at
graduation who want "to avoid the fact or appearance of participation" in the
invocation and benediction are psychologically obligated by "public pressure, as
well as peer pressure, . . . to stand as a group or, at least, maintain respectful
silence" during those prayers. This assertion - the very linchpin of the Court's
opinion - is almost as intriguing for what it does not say as for what it says. It
does not say, for example, that students are psychologically coerced to bow
their heads, place their hands in a Durer-like prayer position, pay attention to
the prayers, utter "Amen," or in fact pray. (Perhaps further intensive
psychological research remains to be done on these matters.) It claims only that
students are psychologically coerced "to stand . . . or, at least, maintain
respectful silence." Both halves of this disjunctive (both of which must amount
to the fact or appearance of participation in prayer if the Court's analysis is to
survive on its own terms) merit particular attention.
To begin with the latter: the Court's notion that a student who simply sits in
"respectful silence" during the invocation and benediction (when all others are
standing) has somehow joined - or would somehow be perceived as having

Robson

952

The First Amendment

joined - in the prayers is nothing short of ludicrous. We indeed live in a vulgar
age. But surely "our social conventions" have not coarsened to the point that
anyone who does not stand on his chair and shout obscenities can reasonably
be deemed to have assented to everything said in his presence. ***
But let us assume the very worst, that the nonparticipating graduate is "subtly
coerced" . . . to stand! Even that half of the disjunctive does not remotely
establish a "participation" (or an "appearance of participation") in a religious
exercise. The Court acknowledges that, "in our culture, standing . . . can signify
adherence to a view or simple respect for the views of others." (Much more often
the latter than the former, I think, except perhaps in the proverbial town
meeting, where one votes by standing.) ***
The opinion manifests that the Court itself has not given careful consideration
to its test of psychological coercion. For if it had, how could it observe, with no
hint of concern or disapproval, that students stood for the Pledge of Allegiance,
which immediately preceded Rabbi Gutterman's invocation? The government
can, of course, no more coerce political orthodoxy than religious orthodoxy.
West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943). Moreover, since the Pledge of
Allegiance has been revised since Barnette to include the phrase "under God,"
recital of the Pledge would appear to raise the same Establishment Clause issue
as the invocation and benediction. If students were psychologically coerced to
remain standing during the invocation, they must also have been
psychologically coerced, moments before, to stand for (and thereby, in the
Court's view, take part in or appear to take part in) the Pledge. Must the Pledge
therefore be barred from the public schools (both from graduation ceremonies
and from the classroom)? In Barnette, we held that a public school student
could not be compelled to recite the Pledge; we did not even hint that she could
not be compelled to observe respectful silence - indeed, even to stand in
respectful silence - when those who wished to recite it did so. Logically, that
ought to be the next project for the Court's bulldozer.
I also find it odd that the Court concludes that high school graduates may not
be subjected to this supposed psychological coercion, yet refrains from
addressing whether "mature adults" may. I had thought that the reason
graduation from high school is regarded as so significant an event is that it is
generally associated with transition from adolescence to young adulthood.
Many graduating seniors, of course, are old enough to vote. Why, then, does the
Court treat them as though they were first-graders? Will we soon have a
jurisprudence that distinguishes between mature and immature adults?
B
The other "dominant fac[t]" identified by the Court is that "[s]tate officials direct
the performance of a formal religious exercise" at school graduation ceremonies.
"Direct[ing] the performance of a formal religious exercise" has a sound of
liturgy to it, summoning up images of the principal directing acolytes where to
carry the cross, or showing the rabbi where to unroll the Torah. A Court
professing to be engaged in a "delicate and fact-sensitive" line-drawing would
better describe what it means as "prescribing the content of an invocation and
benediction." But even that would be false. All the record shows is that
principals of the Providence public schools, acting within their delegated
authority, have invited clergy to deliver invocations and benedictions at

Robson

953

The First Amendment

graduations; and that Principal Lee invited Rabbi Gutterman, provided him a
two-page pamphlet, prepared by the National Conference of Christians and
Jews, giving general advice on inclusive prayer for civic occasions, and advised
him that his prayers at graduation should be nonsectarian. How these facts can
fairly be transformed into the charges that Principal Lee "directed and
controlled the content of [Rabbi Gutterman's] prayer," that school officials
"monitor prayer," and attempted to "`compose official prayers,'" and that the
"government involvement with religious activity in this case is pervasive," is
difficult to fathom. The Court identifies nothing in the record remotely
suggesting that school officials have ever drafted, edited, screened, or censored
graduation prayers, or that Rabbi Gutterman was a mouthpiece of the school
officials.
These distortions of the record are, of course, not harmless error: without them,
the Court's solemn assertion that the school officials could reasonably be
perceived to be "enforc[ing] a religious orthodoxy," would ring as hollow, as it
ought.
III
The deeper flaw in the Court's opinion does not lie in its wrong answer to the
question whether there was state-induced "peer-pressure" coercion; it lies,
rather, in the Court's making violation of the Establishment Clause hinge on
such a precious question. The coercion that was a hallmark of historical
establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial
support by force of law and threat of penalty. Typically, attendance at the state
church was required; only clergy of the official church could lawfully perform
sacraments; and dissenters, if tolerated, faced an array of civil disabilities. Thus,
for example, in the colony of Virginia, where the Church of England had been
established, ministers were required by law to conform to the doctrine and rites
of the Church of England; and all persons were required to attend church and
observe the Sabbath, were tithed for the public support of Anglican ministers,
and were taxed for the costs of building and repairing churches.
The Establishment Clause was adopted to prohibit such an establishment of
religion at the federal level (and to protect state establishments of religion from
federal interference). I will further acknowledge for the sake of argument that,
as some scholars have argued, by 1790, the term "establishment" had acquired
an additional meaning - "financial support of religion generally, by public
taxation" - that reflected the development of "general or multiple"
establishments, not limited to a single church. But that would still be an
establishment coerced by force of law. ***
Voluntary prayer at graduation - a one-time ceremony at which parents, friends,
and relatives are present - can hardly be thought to raise the same concerns.
IV
Our Religion Clause jurisprudence has become bedeviled (so to speak) by
reliance on formulaic abstractions that are not derived from, but positively
conflict with, our long-accepted constitutional traditions. Foremost among these
has been the so-called Lemon test, see Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), which has
received well-earned criticism from many Members of this Court. The Court
today demonstrates the irrelevance of Lemon by essentially ignoring it, see ante,

Robson

954

The First Amendment

at 587, and the interment of that case may be the one happy byproduct of the
Court's otherwise lamentable decision. Unfortunately, however, the Court has
replaced Lemon with its psycho-coercion test, which suffers the double
disability of having no roots whatever in our people's historic practice and being
as infinitely expandable as the reasons for psychotherapy itself.
Another happy aspect of the case is that it is only a jurisprudential disaster,
and not a practical one. Given the odd basis for the Court's decision,
invocations and benedictions will be able to be given at public school
graduations next June, as they have for the past century and a half, so long as
school authorities make clear that anyone who abstains from screaming in
protest does not necessarily participate in the prayers. All that is seemingly
needed is an announcement, or perhaps a written insertion at the beginning of
the graduation program, to the effect that, while all are asked to rise for the
invocation and benediction, none is compelled to join in them, nor will be
assumed, by rising, to have done so. That obvious fact recited, the graduates
and their parents may proceed to thank God, as Americans have always done,
for the blessings He has generously bestowed on them and on their country.
The reader has been told much in this case about the personal interest of Mr.
Weisman and his daughter, and very little about the personal interests on the
other side. They are not inconsequential. Church and state would not be such a
difficult subject if religion were, as the Court apparently thinks it to be, some
purely personal avocation that can be indulged entirely in secret, like
pornography, in the privacy of one's room. For most believers, it is not that, and
has never been. Religious men and women of almost all denominations have felt
it necessary to acknowledge and beseech the blessing of God as a people, and
not just as individuals, because they believe in the "protection of divine
Providence," as the Declaration of Independence put it, not just for individuals
but for societies; because they believe God to be, as Washington's first
Thanksgiving Proclamation put it, the "Great Lord and Ruler of Nations." One
can believe in the effectiveness of such public worship, or one can deprecate
and deride it. But the longstanding American tradition of prayer at official
ceremonies displays with unmistakable clarity that the Establishment Clause
does not forbid the government to accommodate it.
The narrow context of the present case involves a community's celebration of
one of the milestones in its young citizens' lives, and it is a bold step for this
Court to seek to banish from that occasion, and from thousands of similar
celebrations throughout this land, the expression of gratitude to God that a
majority of the community wishes to make. The issue before us today is not the
abstract philosophical question whether the alternative of frustrating this desire
of a religious majority is to be preferred over the alternative of imposing
"psychological coercion," or a feeling of exclusion, upon nonbelievers. Rather,
the question is whether a mandatory choice in favor of the former has been
imposed by the United States Constitution. As the age-old practices of our
people show, the answer to that question is not at all in doubt.
I must add one final observation: the Founders of our Republic knew the
fearsome potential of sectarian religious belief to generate civil dissension and
civil strife. And they also knew that nothing, absolutely nothing, is so inclined
to foster among religious believers of various faiths a toleration - no, an

Robson

955

The First Amendment

affection - for one another than voluntarily joining in prayer together, to the
God whom they all worship and seek. Needless to say, no one should be
compelled to do that, but it is a shame to deprive our public culture of the
opportunity, and indeed the encouragement, for people to do it voluntarily. The
Baptist or Catholic who heard and joined in the simple and inspiring prayers of
Rabbi Gutterman on this official and patriotic occasion was inoculated from
religious bigotry and prejudice in a manner that cannot be replicated. To
deprive our society of that important unifying mechanism in order to spare the
nonbeliever what seems to me the minimal inconvenience of standing, or even
sitting in respectful nonparticipation, is as senseless in policy as it is
unsupported in law.
For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.

Santa	  Fe	  Independent	  School	  District	  v.	  Doe	  
530 U.S. 290 (2000)

STEVENS, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH O'CONNOR, KENNEDY, SOUTER,
GINSBURG, AND BREYER, JJ., JOINED. REHNQUIST, C. J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH
SCALIA AND THOMAS, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE STEVENS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Prior to 1995, the Santa Fe High School student who occupied the school's
elective office of student council chaplain delivered a prayer over the public
address system before each varsity football game for the entire season. This
practice, along with others, was challenged in District Court as a violation of
the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. While these proceedings
were pending in the District Court, the school district adopted a different policy
that permits, but does not require, prayer initiated and led by a student at all
home games. The District Court entered an order modifying that policy to
permit only nonsectarian, nonproselytizing prayer. The Court of Appeals held
that, even as modified by the District Court, the football prayer policy was
invalid. We granted the school district's petition for certiorari to review that
holding.
I
The Santa Fe Independent School District (District) is a political subdivision of
the State of Texas, responsible for the education of more than 4,000 students in
a small community in the southern part of the State. The District includes the
Santa Fe High School, two primary schools, an intermediate school and the
junior high school. Respondents are two sets of current or former students and
their respective mothers. One family is Mormon and the other is Catholic. The
District Court permitted respondents (Does) to litigate anonymously to protect
them from intimidation or harassment.
Respondents commenced this action in April 1995 and moved for a temporary
restraining order to prevent the District from violating the Establishment
Clause at the imminent graduation exercises. In their complaint the Does
alleged that the District had engaged in several proselytizing practices, such as

Robson

956

The First Amendment

promoting attendance at a Baptist revival meeting, encouraging membership in
religious clubs, chastising children who held minority religious beliefs, and
distributing Gideon Bibles on school premises. They also alleged that the
District allowed students to read Christian invocations and benedictions from
the stage at graduation ceremonies, and to deliver overtly Christian prayers
over the public address system at home football games.
On May 10, 1995, the District Court entered an interim order addressing a
number of different issues. With respect to the impending graduation, the order
provided that "non-denominational prayer" consisting of "an invocation and/or
benediction" could be presented by a senior student or students selected by
members of the graduating class. The text of the prayer was to be determined
by the students, without scrutiny or preapproval by school officials. References
to particular religious figures "such as Mohammed, Jesus, Buddha, or the like"
would be permitted "as long as the general thrust of the prayer is nonproselytizing."
In response to that portion of the order, the District adopted a series of policies
over several months dealing with prayer at school functions. The policies
enacted in May and July for graduation ceremonies provided the format for the
August and October policies for football games. The May policy provided:
"`The board has chosen to permit the graduating senior class, with the advice
and counsel of the senior class principal or designee, to elect by secret ballot to
choose whether an invocation and benediction shall be part of the graduation
exercise. If so chosen the class shall elect by secret ballot, from a list of student
volunteers, students to deliver nonsectarian, nonproselytizing invocations and
benedictions for the purpose of solemnizing their graduation ceremonies.'"

*** In July, the District enacted another policy eliminating the requirement that
invocations and benedictions be "nonsectarian and nonproselytising," but also
providing that if the District were to be enjoined from enforcing that policy, the
May policy would automatically become effective.
The August policy, which was titled "Prayer at Football Games," was similar to
the July policy for graduations. It also authorized two student elections, the
first to determine whether "invocations" should be delivered, and the second to
select the spokesperson to deliver them. Like the July policy, it contained two
parts, an initial statement that omitted any requirement that the content of the
invocation be "nonsectarian and nonproselytising," and a fallback provision that
automatically added that limitation if the preferred policy should be enjoined.
On August 31, 1995, according to the parties' stipulation, "the district's high
school students voted to determine whether a student would deliver prayer at
varsity football games.... The students chose to allow a student to say a prayer
at football games." A week later, in a separate election, they selected a student
"to deliver the prayer at varsity football games."
The final policy (October policy) is essentially the same as the August policy,
though it omits the word "prayer" from its title, and refers to "messages" and
"statements" as well as "invocations." It is the validity of that policy that is
before us.
The District Court did enter an order precluding enforcement of the first, openended policy. Relying on our decision in Lee v. Weisman (1992), it held that the

Robson

The First Amendment

school's "action must not `coerce anyone to support or participate in' a religious
exercise." Applying that test, it concluded that the graduation prayers appealed
"to distinctively Christian beliefs," and that delivering a prayer "over the school's
public address system prior to each football and baseball game coerces student
participation in religious events." Both parties appealed, the District contending
that the enjoined portion of the October policy was permissible and the Does
contending that both alternatives violated the Establishment Clause. The Court
of Appeals majority agreed with the Does.
*** We granted the District's petition for certiorari, limited to the following
question: "Whether petitioner's policy permitting student-led, student-initiated
prayer at football games violates the Establishment Clause." We conclude, as
did the Court of Appeals, that it does.
II
The first Clause in the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution provides
that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The Fourteenth Amendment imposes
those substantive limitations on the legislative power of the States and their
political subdivisions. In Lee v. Weisman (1992), we held that a prayer delivered
by a rabbi at a middle school graduation ceremony violated that Clause.
Although this case involves student prayer at a different type of school function,
our analysis is properly guided by the principles that we endorsed in Lee.
*** In this case the District first argues that this principle is inapplicable to its
October policy because the messages are private student speech, not public
speech. It reminds us that "there is a crucial difference between government
speech endorsing religion, which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private
speech endorsing religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses
protect." Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens,
(1990) (opinion of O'Connor, J.). We certainly agree with that distinction, but we
are not persuaded that the pregame invocations should be regarded as "private
speech."
These invocations are authorized by a government policy and take place on
government property at government-sponsored school-related events. Of course,
not every message delivered under such circumstances is the government's own.
We have held, for example, that an individual's contribution to a governmentcreated forum was not government speech. See Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995). Although the District relies heavily on
Rosenberger and similar cases involving such forums, it is clear that the
pregame ceremony is not the type of forum discussed in those cases. The Santa
Fe school officials simply do not "evince either `by policy or by practice,' any
intent to open the [pregame ceremony] to `indiscriminate use,' . . . by the
student body generally." Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier (1988) (quoting
Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn. (1983)). Rather, the school allows
only one student, the same student for the entire season, to give the invocation.
The statement or invocation, moreover, is subject to particular regulations that
confine the content and topic of the student's message.
Granting only one student access to the stage at a time does not, of course,
necessarily preclude a finding that a school has created a limited public forum.

Robson

958

The First Amendment

Here, however, Santa Fe's student election system ensures that only those
messages deemed "appropriate" under the District's policy may be delivered.
That is, the majoritarian process implemented by the District guarantees, by
definition, that minority candidates will never prevail and that their views will
be effectively silenced.
Recently, in Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth (2000), we
explained why student elections that determine, by majority vote, which
expressive activities shall receive or not receive school benefits are
constitutionally problematic. ***
Like the student referendum for funding in Southworth, this student election
does nothing to protect minority views but rather places the students who hold
such views at the mercy of the majority. Because "fundamental rights may not
be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections," West Virginia
Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette (1943), the District's elections are insufficient safeguards
of diverse student speech.
Moreover, the District has failed to divorce itself from the religious content in
the invocations. It has not succeeded in doing so, either by claiming that its
policy is "`one of neutrality rather than endorsement'" or by characterizing the
individual student as the "circuit-breaker" in the process. Contrary to the
District's repeated assertions that it has adopted a "hands-off" approach to the
pregame invocation, the realities of the situation plainly reveal that its policy
involves both perceived and actual endorsement of religion. In this case, as we
found in Lee, the "degree of school involvement" makes it clear that the pregame
prayers bear "the imprint of the State and thus put school-age children who
objected in an untenable position."
The District has attempted to disentangle itself from the religious messages by
developing the two-step student election process. The text of the October policy,
however, exposes the extent of the school's entanglement. The elections take
place at all only because the school "board has chosen to permit students to
deliver a brief invocation and/or message." The elections thus "shall" be
conducted "by the high school student council" and "[u]pon advice and direction
of the high school principal." The decision whether to deliver a message is first
made by majority vote of the entire student body, followed by a choice of the
speaker in a separate, similar majority election. Even though the particular
words used by the speaker are not determined by those votes, the policy
mandates that the "statement or invocation" be "consistent with the goals and
purposes of this policy," which are "to solemnize the event, to promote good
sportsmanship and student safety, and to establish the appropriate
environment for the competition."
In addition to involving the school in the selection of the speaker, the policy, by
its terms, invites and encourages religious messages. The policy itself states
that the purpose of the message is "to solemnize the event." A religious message
is the most obvious method of solemnizing an event. Moreover, the
requirements that the message "promote good citizenship" and "establish the
appropriate environment for competition" further narrow the types of message
deemed appropriate, suggesting that a solemn, yet nonreligious, message, such
as commentary on United States foreign policy, would be prohibited. Indeed,

Robson

959

The First Amendment

the only type of message that is expressly endorsed in the text is an
"invocation"--a term that primarily describes an appeal for divine assistance. In
fact, as used in the past at Santa Fe High School, an "invocation" has always
entailed a focused religious message. Thus, the expressed purposes of the
policy encourage the selection of a religious message, and that is precisely how
the students understand the policy. The results of the elections described in the
parties' stipulation make it clear that the students understood that the central
question before them was whether prayer should be a part of the pregame
ceremony. We recognize the important role that public worship plays in many
communities, as well as the sincere desire to include public prayer as a part of
various occasions so as to mark those occasions' significance. But such
religious activity in public schools, as elsewhere, must comport with the First
Amendment.
The actual or perceived endorsement of the message, moreover, is established
by factors beyond just the text of the policy. Once the student speaker is
selected and the message composed, the invocation is then delivered to a large
audience assembled as part of a regularly scheduled, school-sponsored function
conducted on school property. The message is broadcast over the school's
public address system, which remains subject to the control of school officials.
It is fair to assume that the pregame ceremony is clothed in the traditional
indicia of school sporting events, which generally include not just the team, but
also cheerleaders and band members dressed in uniforms sporting the school
name and mascot. The school's name is likely written in large print across the
field and on banners and flags. The crowd will certainly include many who
display the school colors and insignia on their school T-shirts, jackets, or hats
and who may also be waving signs displaying the school name. It is in a setting
such as this that "[t]he board has chosen to permit" the elected student to rise
and give the "statement or invocation."
In this context the members of the listening audience must perceive
pregame message as a public expression of the views of the majority of
student body delivered with the approval of the school administration.
Regardless of the listener's support for, or objection to, the message,
objective Santa Fe High School student will unquestionably perceive
inevitable pregame prayer as stamped with her school's seal of approval.

The text and history of this policy, moreover, reinforce our objective student's
perception that the prayer is, in actuality, encouraged by the school. When a
governmental entity professes a secular purpose for an arguably religious policy,
the government's characterization is, of course, entitled to some deference. But
it is nonetheless the duty of the courts to "distinguis[h] a sham secular purpose
from a sincere one." Wallace (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).
According to the District, the secular purposes of the policy are to "foste[r] free
expression of private persons ... as well [as to] solemniz[e] sporting events,
promot[e] good sportsmanship and student safety, and establis[h] an
appropriate environment for competition." We note, however, that the District's
approval of only one specific kind of message, an "invocation," is not necessary
to further any of these purposes. Additionally, the fact that only one student is
permitted to give a content-limited message suggests that this policy does little
to "foste[r] free expression." Furthermore, regardless of whether one considers a

Robson

960

The First Amendment

sporting event an appropriate occasion for solemnity, the use of an invocation
to foster such solemnity is impermissible when, in actuality, it constitutes
prayer sponsored by the school. And it is unclear what type of message would
be both appropriately "solemnizing" under the District's policy and yet nonreligious.
Most striking to us is the evolution of the current policy from the longsanctioned office of "Student Chaplain" to the candidly titled "Prayer at Football
Games" regulation. This history indicates that the District intended to preserve
the practice of prayer before football games. The conclusion that the District
viewed the October policy simply as a continuation of the previous policies is
dramatically illustrated by the fact that the school did not conduct a new
election, pursuant to the current policy, to replace the results of the previous
election, which occurred under the former policy. Given these observations,
and in light of the school's history of regular delivery of a student-led prayer at
athletic events, it is reasonable to infer that the specific purpose of the policy
was to preserve a popular "state-sponsored religious practice." Lee.
School sponsorship of a religious message is impermissible because it sends the
ancillary message to members of the audience who are nonadherants "that they
are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an
accompanying message to adherants that they are insiders, favored members of
the political community." Lynch v. Donnelly (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring).
The delivery of such a message--over the school's public address system, by a
speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty,
and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public
prayer--is not properly characterized as "private" speech.
III
The District next argues that its football policy is distinguishable from the
graduation prayer in Lee because it does not coerce students to participate in
religious observances. Its argument has two parts: first, that there is no
impermissible government coercion because the pregame messages are the
product of student choices; and second, that there is really no coercion at all
because attendance at an extracurricular event, unlike a graduation ceremony,
is voluntary.
The reasons just discussed explaining why the alleged "circuit-breaker"
mechanism of the dual elections and student speaker do not turn public speech
into private speech also demonstrate why these mechanisms do not insulate the
school from the coercive element of the final message. In fact, this aspect of the
District's argument exposes anew the concerns that are created by the
majoritarian election system. ***
The District further argues that attendance at the commencement ceremonies
at issue in Lee "differs dramatically" from attendance at high school football
games, which it contends "are of no more than passing interest to many
students" and are "decidedly extracurricular," thus dissipating any coercion.
Attendance at a high school football game, unlike showing up for class, is
certainly not required in order to receive a diploma. Moreover, we may assume
that the District is correct in arguing that the informal pressure to attend an

Robson

961

The First Amendment

athletic event is not as strong as a senior's desire to attend her own graduation
ceremony.
There are some students, however, such as cheerleaders, members of the band,
and, of course, the team members themselves, for whom seasonal commitments
mandate their attendance, sometimes for class credit. The District also
minimizes the importance to many students of attending and participating in
extracurricular activities as part of a complete educational experience. As we
noted in Lee, "[l]aw reaches past formalism." To assert that high school
students do not feel immense social pressure, or have a truly genuine desire, to
be involved in the extracurricular event that is American high school football is
"formalistic in the extreme." We stressed in Lee the obvious observation that
"adolescents are often susceptible to pressure from their peers towards
conformity, and that the influence is strongest in matters of social convention."
High school home football games are traditional gatherings of a school
community; they bring together students and faculty as well as friends and
family from years present and past to root for a common cause. Undoubtedly,
the games are not important to some students, and they voluntarily choose not
to attend. For many others, however, the choice between whether to attend
these games or to risk facing a personally offensive religious ritual is in no
practical sense an easy one. The Constitution, moreover, demands that the
school may not force this difficult choice upon these students for "[i]t is a tenet
of the First Amendment that the State cannot require one of its citizens to
forfeit his or her rights and benefits as the price of resisting conformance to
state-sponsored religious practice."
Even if we regard every high school student's decision to attend a home football
game as purely voluntary, we are nevertheless persuaded that the delivery of a
pregame prayer has the improper effect of coercing those present to participate
in an act of religious worship. For "the government may no more use social
pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use more direct means." As in Lee,
"[w]hat to most believers may seem nothing more than a reasonable request
that the nonbeliever respect their religious practices, in a school context may
appear to the nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the
machinery of the State to enforce a religious orthodoxy." The constitutional
command will not permit the District "to exact religious conformity from a
student as the price" of joining her classmates at a varsity football game.
The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment prevent the government from
making any law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof. By no means do these commands impose a prohibition on all
religious activity in our public schools. *** Thus, nothing in the Constitution as
interpreted by this Court prohibits any public school student from voluntarily
praying at any time before, during, or after the schoolday. But the religious
liberty protected by the Constitution is abridged when the State affirmatively
sponsors the particular religious practice of prayer.
IV
Finally, the District argues repeatedly that the Does have made a premature
facial challenge to the October policy that necessarily must fail. The District
emphasizes, quite correctly, that until a student actually delivers a solemnizing
message under the latest version of the policy, there can be no certainty that

Robson

962

The First Amendment

any of the statements or invocations will be religious. Thus, it concludes, the
October policy necessarily survives a facial challenge.
This argument, however, assumes that we are concerned only with the serious
constitutional injury that occurs when a student is forced to participate in an
act of religious worship because she chooses to attend a school event. But the
Constitution also requires that we keep in mind "the myriad, subtle ways in
which Establishment Clause values can be eroded," and that we guard against
other different, yet equally important, constitutional injuries. One is the mere
passage by the District of a policy that has the purpose and perception of
government establishment of religion. Another is the implementation of a
governmental electoral process that subjects the issue of prayer to a
majoritarian vote.
*** Our examination of those circumstances above leads to the conclusion that
this policy does not provide the District with the constitutional safe harbor it
sought. The policy is invalid on its face because it establishes an improper
majoritarian election on religion, and unquestionably has the purpose and
creates the perception of encouraging the delivery of prayer at a series of
important school events.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, accordingly, affirmed.
It is so ordered.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, WITH WHOM JUSTICE SCALIA AND JUSTICE THOMAS JOIN,
DISSENTING.
The Court distorts existing precedent to conclude that the school district's
student-message program is invalid on its face under the Establishment Clause.
But even more disturbing than its holding is the tone of the Court's opinion; it
bristles with hostility to all things religious in public life. Neither the holding
nor the tone of the opinion is faithful to the meaning of the Establishment
Clause, when it is recalled that George Washington himself, at the request of
the very Congress which passed the Bill of Rights, proclaimed a day of "public
thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts
the many and signal favors of Almighty God." Presidential Proclamation, 1
Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 1789-1897.
We do not learn until late in the Court's opinion that respondents in this case
challenged the district's student-message program at football games before it
had been put into practice. ***
The Court, venturing into the realm of prophesy, decides that it "need not wait
for the inevitable" and invalidates the district's policy on its face. To do so, it
applies the most rigid version of the oft-criticized test of Lemon v. Kurtzman
(1971).
Lemon has had a checkered career in the decisional law of this Court. See, e.g.,
Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist. (1993) (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment) (collecting opinions criticizing Lemon); Wallace v.
Jaffree (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (stating that Lemon's "three-part test
represents a determined effort to craft a workable rule from a historically faulty

Robson

963

The First Amendment

doctrine; but the rule can only be as sound as the doctrine it attempts to
service" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Committee for Public Ed. and
Religious Liberty v. Regan (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (deriding "the
sisyphean task of trying to patch together the blurred, indistinct, and variable
barrier described in Lemon"). We have even gone so far as to state that it has
never been binding on us. Lynch v. Donnelly (1984). Indeed, in Lee v. Weisman
(1992), an opinion upon which the Court relies heavily today, we mentioned but
did not feel compelled to apply the Lemon test. See also Agostini v. Felton (1997)
(stating that Lemon's entanglement test is merely "an aspect of the inquiry into
a statute's effect"); Hunt v. McNair (1973) (stating that the Lemon factors are "no
more than helpful signposts").
Even if it were appropriate to apply the Lemon test here, the district's studentmessage policy should not be invalidated on its face. The Court applies Lemon
and holds that the "policy is invalid on its face because it establishes an
improper majoritarian election on religion, and unquestionably has the purpose
and creates the perception of encouraging the delivery of prayer at a series of
important school events." The Court's reliance on each of these conclusions
misses the mark.
First, the Court misconstrues the nature of the "majoritarian election"
permitted by the policy as being an election on "prayer" and "religion." *** [It] is
possible that the students might vote not to have a pregame speaker, in which
case there would be no threat of a constitutional violation. It is also possible
that the election would not focus on prayer, but on public speaking ability or
social popularity. And if student campaigning did begin to focus on prayer, the
school might decide to implement reasonable campaign restrictions.
*** Second, with respect to the policy's purpose, the Court holds that "the
simple enactment of this policy, with the purpose and perception of school
endorsement of student prayer, was a constitutional violation." But the policy
itself has plausible secular purposes: "[T]o solemnize the event, to promote good
sportsmanship and student safety, and to establish the appropriate
environment for the competition." *** The Court grants no deference to--and
appears openly hostile toward--the policy's stated purposes, and wastes no time
in concluding that they are a sham.
*** But it is easy to think of solemn messages that are not religious in nature,
for example urging that a game be fought fairly. And sporting events often begin
with a solemn rendition of our national anthem, with its concluding verse "And
this be our motto: `In God is our trust.'" Under the Court's logic, a public school
that sponsors the singing of the national anthem before football games violates
the Establishment Clause. Although the Court apparently believes that
solemnizing football games is an illegitimate purpose, the voters in the school
district seem to disagree. Nothing in the Establishment Clause prevents them
from making this choice.
*** Finally, the Court seems to demand that a government policy be completely
neutral as to content or be considered one that endorses religion. This is
undoubtedly a new requirement, as our Establishment Clause jurisprudence
simply does not mandate "content neutrality." That concept is found in our
First Amendment speech cases and is used as a guide for determining when we

Robson

964

The First Amendment

apply strict scrutiny. *** The Court seems to think that the fact that the policy
is not content neutral somehow controls the Establishment Clause inquiry. But
even our speech jurisprudence would not require that all public school actions
with respect to student speech be content neutral. See, e.g., Bethel School Dist.
No. 403 v. Fraser (1986) (allowing the imposition of sanctions against a student
speaker who, in nominating a fellow student for elective office during an
assembly, referred to his candidate in terms of an elaborate sexually explicit
metaphor). Schools do not violate the First Amendment every time they restrict
student speech to certain categories. But under the Court's view, a school
policy under which the student body president is to solemnize the graduation
ceremony by giving a favorable introduction to the guest speaker would be
facially unconstitutional. Solemnization "invites and encourages" prayer and the
policy's content limitations prohibit the student body president from giving a
solemn, yet non-religious, message like "commentary on United States foreign
policy."
The policy at issue here may be applied in an unconstitutional manner, but it
will be time enough to invalidate it if that is found to be the case. I would
reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Note:	  Elk	  Grove	  Unified	  Sch.	  Dist.	  v.	  Newdow	  
The Court seemed poised to consider whether the phrase “Under God”
that was added to the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954 violated the
Establishment Clause. Writing for the Court in Elk Grove Unified Sch.
Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1 (2004), Justice Stevens began the opinion
thusly:
Each day elementary school teachers in the Elk Grove Unified School District
(School District) lead their classes in a group recitation of the Pledge of
Allegiance. Respondent, Michael A. Newdow, is an atheist whose daughter
participates in that daily exercise. Because the Pledge contains the words “under
God,” he views the School District's policy as a religious indoctrination of his
child that violates the First Amendment. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit agreed with Newdow. In light of the obvious importance of
that decision, we granted certiorari to review the First Amendment issue and,
preliminarily, the question whether Newdow has standing to invoke the
jurisdiction of the federal courts. We conclude that Newdow lacks standing and
therefore reverse the Court of Appeals' decision.

The Court therefore deflected the First Amendment issue by finding that
Michael Newdow as a noncustodial father did not have standing. Chief
Justice Rehnquist, joined by O’Connor and Thomas, dissented in part,
criticizing the majority for reaching its decision on “a novel prudential
standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the
constitutional claim.” These Justices would have reversed the Ninth
Circuit on the First Amendment merits and held “Under God” in the
Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the Establishment Clause’s
prohibition.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The State of Ohio has established a pilot program designed to provide
educational choices to families with children who reside in the Cleveland City
School District. The question presented is whether this program offends the
Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. We hold that it does
not.
There are more than 75,000 children enrolled in the Cleveland City School
District. The majority of these children are from low-income and minority
families. Few of these families enjoy the means to send their children to any
school other than an inner-city public school. For more than a generation,
however, Cleveland's public schools have been among the worst performing
public schools in the Nation. In 1995, a Federal District Court declared a "crisis
of magnitude" and placed the entire Cleveland school district under state
control. Shortly thereafter, the state auditor found that Cleveland's public
schools were in the midst of a "crisis that is perhaps unprecedented in the
history of American education." The district had failed to meet any of the 18
state standards for minimal acceptable performance. Only 1 in 10 ninth graders
could pass a basic proficiency examination, and students at all levels performed
at a dismal rate compared with students in other Ohio public schools. More
than two-thirds of high school students either dropped or failed out before
graduation. Of those students who managed to reach their senior year, one of
every four still failed to graduate. Of those students who did graduate, few
could read, write, or compute at levels comparable to their counterparts in
other cities.
It is against this backdrop that Ohio enacted, among other initiatives, its Pilot
Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.974-3313.979
(Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (program). The program provides financial
assistance to families in any Ohio school district that is or has been "under
federal court order requiring supervision and operational management of the
district by the state superintendent." Cleveland is the only Ohio school district
to fall within that category.
The program provides two basic kinds of assistance to parents of children in a
covered district. First, the program provides tuition aid for students in

Robson

966

The First Amendment

kindergarten through third grade, expanding each year through eighth grade, to
attend a participating public or private school of their parent's choosing.
Second, the program provides tutorial aid for students who choose to remain
enrolled in public school.
The tuition aid portion of the program is designed to provide educational
choices to parents who reside in a covered district. Any private school, whether
religious or nonreligious, may participate in the program and accept program
students so long as the school is located within the boundaries of a covered
district and meets statewide educational standards. Participating private
schools must agree not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic
background, or to "advocate or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any
person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion." Any
public school located in a school district adjacent to the covered district may
also participate in the program. Adjacent public schools are eligible to receive a
$2,250 tuition grant for each program student accepted in addition to the full
amount of per-pupil state funding attributable to each additional student. All
participating schools, whether public or private, are required to accept students
in accordance with rules and procedures established by the state
superintendent.
Tuition aid is distributed to parents according to financial need. Families with
incomes below 200% of the poverty line are given priority and are eligible to
receive 90% of private school tuition up to $2,250. For these lowest-income
families, participating private schools may not charge a parental co-payment
greater than $250. For all other families, the program pays 75% of tuition costs,
up to $1,875, with no co-payment cap. These families receive tuition aid only if
the number of available scholarships exceeds the number of low-income
children who choose to participate. Where tuition aid is spent depends solely
upon where parents who receive tuition aid choose to enroll their child. If
parents choose a private school, checks are made payable to the parents who
then endorse the checks over to the chosen school.
The tutorial aid portion of the program provides tutorial assistance through
grants to any student in a covered district who chooses to remain in public
school.***
The program has been in operation within the Cleveland City School District
since the 1996-1997 school year. In the 1999-2000 school year, 56 private
schools participated in the program, 46 (or 82%) of which had a religious
affiliation. None of the public schools in districts adjacent to Cleveland have
elected to participate. More than 3,700 students participated in the scholarship
program, most of whom (96%) enrolled in religiously affiliated schools. Sixty
percent of these students were from families at or below the poverty line. In the
1998-1999 school year, approximately 1,400 Cleveland public school students
received tutorial aid. This number was expected to double during the 19992000 school year.
The program is part of a broader undertaking by the State to enhance the
educational options of Cleveland's schoolchildren in response to the 1995
takeover. That undertaking includes programs governing community and
magnet schools. Community schools are funded under state law but are run by

Robson

967

The First Amendment

their own school boards, not by local school districts. These schools enjoy
academic independence to hire their own teachers and to determine their own
curriculum. They can have no religious affiliation and are required to accept
students by lottery. During the 1999-2000 school year, there were 10 start-up
community schools in the Cleveland City School District with more than 1,900
students enrolled. For each child enrolled in a community school, the school
receives state funding of $4,518, twice the funding a participating program
school may receive.
Magnet schools are public schools operated by a local school board that
emphasize a particular subject area, teaching method, or service to students.
For each student enrolled in a magnet school, the school district receives
$7,746, including state funding of $4,167, the same amount received per
student enrolled at a traditional public school. As of 1999, parents in Cleveland
were able to choose from among 23 magnet schools, which together enrolled
more than 13,000 students in kindergarten through eighth grade. These
schools provide specialized teaching methods, such as Montessori, or a
particularized curriculum focus, such as foreign language, computers, or the
arts.
In 1996, respondents, a group of Ohio taxpayers, challenged the Ohio program
in state court on state and federal grounds. The Ohio Supreme Court rejected
respondents' federal claims, but held that the enactment of the program
violated certain procedural requirements of the Ohio Constitution. The state
legislature immediately cured this defect, leaving the basic provisions discussed
above intact.
In July 1999, respondents filed this action in United States District Court,
seeking to enjoin the reenacted program on the ground that it violated the
Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. In August 1999, the
District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring further implementation
of the program, which we stayed pending review by the Court of Appeals, 528
U.S. 983 (1999). In December 1999, the District Court granted summary
judgment for respondents. In December 2000, a divided panel of the Court of
Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court, finding that the program
had the "primary effect" of advancing religion in violation of the Establishment
Clause. The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending disposition in this
Court. We granted certiorari and now reverse the Court of Appeals.
The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, applied to the States
through the Fourteenth Amendment, prevents a State from enacting laws that
have the "purpose" or "effect" of advancing or inhibiting religion. There is no
dispute that the program challenged here was enacted for the valid secular
purpose of providing educational assistance to poor children in a demonstrably
failing public school system. Thus, the question presented is whether the Ohio
program nonetheless has the forbidden "effect" of advancing or inhibiting
religion.
To answer that question, our decisions have drawn a consistent distinction
between government programs that provide aid directly to religious schools and
programs of true private choice, in which government aid reaches religious
schools only as a result of the genuine and independent choices of private

Robson

The First Amendment

individuals. While our jurisprudence with respect to the constitutionality of
direct aid programs has "changed significantly" over the past two decades, our
jurisprudence with respect to true private choice programs has remained
consistent and unbroken. Three times we have confronted Establishment
Clause challenges to neutral government programs that provide aid directly to a
broad class of individuals, who, in turn, direct the aid to religious schools or
institutions of their own choosing. Three times we have rejected such
challenges.
In Mueller v. Allen (1983) we rejected an Establishment Clause challenge to a
Minnesota program authorizing tax deductions for various educational
expenses, including private school tuition costs, even though the great majority
of the program's beneficiaries (96%) were parents of children in religious
schools. *** That the program was one of true private choice, with no evidence
that the State deliberately skewed incentives toward religious schools, was
sufficient for the program to survive scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.
In Witters v. Washington Dept. Services for Blind (1986), we used identical
reasoning to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a vocational
scholarship program that provided tuition aid to a student studying at a
religious institution to become a pastor. Looking at the program as a whole, we
observed that "[a]ny aid ... that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so
only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid
recipients." ***
Five Members of the Court, in separate opinions, emphasized the general rule
from Mueller that the amount of government aid channeled to religious
institutions by individual aid recipients was not relevant to the constitutional
inquiry. Our holding thus rested not on whether few or many recipients chose
to expend government aid at a religious school but, rather, on whether
recipients generally were empowered to direct the aid to schools or institutions
of their own choosing.
Finally, in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist. (1993), we applied Mueller
and Witters to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a federal program
that permitted sign-language interpreters to assist deaf children enrolled in
religious schools. Reviewing our earlier decisions, we stated that "government
programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined
without reference to religion are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause
challenge." ***
Mueller, Witters, and Zobrest thus make clear that where a government aid
program is neutral with respect to religion, and provides assistance directly to a
broad class of citizens who, in turn, direct government aid to religious schools
wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent private choice, the
program is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause. A
program that shares these features permits government aid to reach religious
institutions only by way of the deliberate choices of numerous individual
recipients. The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived
endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual
recipient, not to the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of
benefits. ***

The First Amendment

[W]e have never found a program of true private choice to offend the
Establishment Clause.
We believe that the program challenged here is a program of true private choice,
consistent with Mueller, Witters, and Zobrest, and thus constitutional. As was
true in those cases, the Ohio program is neutral in all respects toward religion.
It is part of a general and multifaceted undertaking by the State of Ohio to
provide educational opportunities to the children of a failed school district. It
confers educational assistance directly to a broad class of individuals defined
without reference to religion, i.e., any parent of a school-age child who resides
in the Cleveland City School District. The program permits the participation of
all schools within the district, religious or nonreligious. Adjacent public schools
also may participate and have a financial incentive to do so. Program benefits
are available to participating families on neutral terms, with no reference to
religion. The only preference stated anywhere in the program is a preference for
low-income families, who receive greater assistance and are given priority for
admission at participating schools.
There are no "financial incentive[s]" that "ske[w]" the program toward religious
schools. *** The program here in fact creates financial disincentives for religious
schools, with private schools receiving only half the government assistance
given to community schools and one-third the assistance given to magnet
schools. Adjacent public schools, should any choose to accept program
students, are also eligible to receive two to three times the state funding of a
private religious school. Families too have a financial disincentive to choose a
private religious school over other schools. Parents that choose to participate in
the scholarship program and then to enroll their children in a private school
(religious or nonreligious) must copay a portion of the school's tuition. Families
that choose a community school, magnet school, or traditional public school
pay nothing. Although such features of the program are not necessary to its
constitutionality, they clearly dispel the claim that the program "creates ...
financial incentive[s] for parents to choose a sectarian school."
Respondents suggest that even without a financial incentive for parents to
choose a religious school, the program creates a "public perception that the
State is endorsing religious practices and beliefs." But we have repeatedly
recognized that no reasonable observer would think a neutral program of
private choice, where state aid reaches religious schools solely as a result of the
numerous independent decisions of private individuals, carries with it the
imprimatur of government endorsement. *** Any objective observer familiar with
the full history and context of the Ohio program would reasonably view it as one
aspect of a broader undertaking to assist poor children in failed schools, not as
an endorsement of religious schooling in general.
There also is no evidence that the program fails to provide genuine
opportunities for Cleveland parents to select secular educational options for
their school-age children. Cleveland schoolchildren enjoy a range of educational
choices: They may remain in public school as before, remain in public school
with publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose a religious
school, obtain a scholarship and choose a nonreligious private school, enroll in
a community school, or enroll in a magnet school. That 46 of the 56 private
schools now participating in the program are religious schools does not

Robson

970

The First Amendment

condemn it as a violation of the Establishment Clause. The Establishment
Clause question is whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children
to religious schools, and that question must be answered by evaluating all
options Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a
program scholarship and then choose a religious school.
Justice Souter [dissenting] speculates that because more private religious
schools currently participate in the program, the program itself must somehow
discourage the participation of private nonreligious schools. But Cleveland's
preponderance of religiously affiliated private schools certainly did not arise as
a result of the program; it is a phenomenon common to many American cities.
See U.S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private School
Universe Survey: 1999-2000, pp.2-4 (NCES 2001-330, 2001) (hereinafter
Private School Universe Survey) (cited in Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae). Indeed, by all accounts the program has captured a remarkable crosssection of private schools, religious and nonreligious. It is true that 82% of
Cleveland's participating private schools are religious schools, but it is also true
that 81% of private schools in Ohio are religious schools. See Brief for State of
Florida etal. as Amici Curiae 16 (citing Private School Universe Survey). To
attribute constitutional significance to this figure, moreover, would lead to the
absurd result that a neutral school-choice program might be permissible in
some parts of Ohio, such as Columbus, where a lower percentage of private
schools are religious schools, but not in inner-city Cleveland, where Ohio has
deemed such programs most sorely needed, but where the preponderance of
religious schools happens to be greater. Likewise, an identical private choice
program might be constitutional in some States, such as Maine or Utah, where
less than 45% of private schools are religious schools, but not in other States,
such as Nebraska or Kansas, where over 90% of private schools are religious
schools.
Respondents and Justice Souter claim that even if we do not focus on the
number of participating schools that are religious schools, we should attach
constitutional significance to the fact that 96% of scholarship recipients have
enrolled in religious schools. They claim that this alone proves parents lack
genuine choice, even if no parent has ever said so. We need not consider this
argument in detail, since it was flatly rejected in Mueller, where we found it
irrelevant that 96% of parents taking deductions for tuition expenses paid
tuition at religious schools. ***
[Moreover] The 96% figure upon which respondents and Justice Souter rely
discounts entirely (1) the more than 1,900 Cleveland children enrolled in
alternative community schools, (2) the more than 13,000 children enrolled in
alternative magnet schools, and (3) the more than 1,400 children enrolled in
traditional public schools with tutorial assistance. Including some or all of
these children in the denominator of children enrolled in nontraditional schools
during the 1999-2000 school year drops the percentage enrolled in religious
schools from 96% to under 20%. The 96% figure also represents but a snapshot
of one particular school year. In the 1997-1998 school year, by contrast, only
78% of scholarship recipients attended religious schools. The difference was
attributable to two private nonreligious schools that had accepted 15% of all
scholarship students electing instead to register as community schools, in light

Robson

971

The First Amendment

of larger per-pupil funding for community schools and the uncertain future of
the scholarship program generated by this litigation. Many of the students
enrolled in these schools as scholarship students remained enrolled as
community school students, thus demonstrating the arbitrariness of counting
one type of school but not the other to assess primary effect. In spite of
repeated questioning from the Court at oral argument, respondents offered no
convincing justification for their approach, which relies entirely on such
arbitrary classifications.
Respondents finally claim that we should look to Committee for Public Ed. &
Religious Liberty v. Nyquist (1973), to decide these cases. We disagree for two
reasons. First, the program in Nyquist was quite different from the program
challenged here. Nyquist involved a New York program that gave a package of
benefits exclusively to private schools and the parents of private school
enrollees. Although the program was enacted for ostensibly secular purposes,
we found that its "function" was "unmistakably to provide desired financial
support for nonpublic, sectarian institutions." Its genesis, we said, was that
private religious schools faced "increasingly grave fiscal problems." The program
thus provided direct money grants to religious schools. *** Indeed, the program
flatly prohibited the participation of any public school, or parent of any public
school enrollee. Ohio's program shares none of these features.
Second, were there any doubt that the program challenged in Nyquist is far
removed from the program challenged here, we expressly reserved judgment
with respect to "a case involving some form of public assistance (e.g.,
scholarships) made available generally without regard to the sectariannonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited." That, of
course, is the very question now before us, and it has since been answered, first
in Mueller, then in Witters and again in Zobrest. To the extent the scope of
Nyquist has remained an open question in light of these later decisions, we now
hold that Nyquist does not govern neutral educational assistance programs that,
like the program here, offer aid directly to a broad class of individual recipients
defined without regard to religion.
In sum, the Ohio program is entirely neutral with respect to religion. It provides
benefits directly to a wide spectrum of individuals, defined only by financial
need and residence in a particular school district. It permits such individuals to
exercise genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious.
The program is therefore a program of true private choice. In keeping with an
unbroken line of decisions rejecting challenges to similar programs, we hold
that the program does not offend the Establishment Clause.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

Robson

972

The First Amendment

many of our inner-city public schools deny emancipation to urban minority
students. Despite this Court's observation nearly 50 years ago in Brown v.
Board of Education, that "it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be
expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education,"
urban children have been forced into a system that continually fails them.
These cases present an example of such failures. Besieged by escalating
financial problems and declining academic achievement, the Cleveland City
School District was in the midst of an academic emergency when Ohio enacted
its scholarship program.
The dissents and respondents wish to invoke the Establishment Clause of the
First Amendment, as incorporated through the Fourteenth, to constrain a
State's neutral efforts to provide greater educational opportunity for
underprivileged minority students. Today's decision properly upholds the
program as constitutional, and I join it in full.
*** Whatever the textual and historical merits of incorporating the
Establishment Clause, I can accept that the Fourteenth Amendment protects
religious liberty rights. But I cannot accept its use to oppose neutral programs
of school choice through the incorporation of the Establishment Clause. There
would be a tragic irony in converting the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of
individual liberty into a prohibition on the exercise of educational choice.
II
The wisdom of allowing States greater latitude in dealing with matters of
religion and education can be easily appreciated in this context. ***
Although one of the purposes of public schools was to promote democracy and
a more egalitarian culture, failing urban public schools disproportionately affect
minority children most in need of educational opportunity. At the time of
Reconstruction, blacks considered public education "a matter of personal
liberation and a necessary function of a free society." Today, however, the
promise of public school education has failed poor inner-city blacks. While in
theory providing education to everyone, the quality of public schools varies
significantly across districts. Just as blacks supported public education during
Reconstruction, many blacks and other minorities now support school choice
programs because they provide the greatest educational opportunities for their
children in struggling communities. Opponents of the program raise formalistic
concerns about the Establishment Clause but ignore the core purposes of the
Fourteenth Amendment.
While the romanticized ideal of universal public education resonates with the
cognoscenti who oppose vouchers, poor urban families just want the best
education for their children, who will certainly need it to function in our hightech and advanced society. As Thomas Sowell noted 30 years ago: "Most black
people have faced too many grim, concrete problems to be romantics. They want
and need certain tangible results, which can be achieved only by developing
certain specific abilities." Black Education: Myths and Tragedies 228 (1972).
The same is true today. An individual's life prospects increase dramatically with
each successfully completed phase of education. For instance, a black high
school dropout earns just over $13,500, but with a high school degree the
average income is almost $21,000. Blacks with a bachelor's degree have an

Robson

973

The First Amendment

average annual income of about $37,500, and $75,500 with a professional
degree. See U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of
the United States 140 (2001) (Table 218). Staying in school and earning a
degree generates real and tangible financial benefits, whereas failure to obtain
even a high school degree essentially relegates students to a life of poverty and,
all too often, of crime. The failure to provide education to poor urban children
perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty, dependence, criminality, and alienation
that continues for the remainder of their lives. If society cannot end racial
discrimination, at least it can arm minorities with the education to defend
themselves from some of discrimination's effects.
Ten States have enacted some form of publicly funded private school choice as
one means of raising the quality of education provided to underprivileged urban
children. These programs address the root of the problem with failing urban
public schools that disproportionately affect minority students. Society's other
solution to these educational failures is often to provide racial preferences in
higher education. Such preferences, however, run afoul of the Fourteenth
Amendment's prohibition against distinctions based on race. See Plessy (Harlan,
J., dissenting). By contrast, school choice programs that involve religious
schools appear unconstitutional only to those who would twist the Fourteenth
Amendment against itself by expansively incorporating the Establishment
Clause. Converting the Fourteenth Amendment from a guarantee of opportunity
to an obstacle against education reform distorts our constitutional values and
disserves those in the greatest need.
As Frederick Douglass poignantly noted "no greater benefit can be bestowed
upon a long benighted people, than giving to them, as we are here earnestly this
day endeavoring to do, the means of an education."

JUSTICE SOUTER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE GINSBURG, AND JUSTICE
BREYER JOIN, DISSENTING.
The Court's majority holds that the Establishment Clause is no bar to Ohio's
payment of tuition at private religious elementary and middle schools under a
scheme that systematically provides tax money to support the schools' religious
missions. The occasion for the legislation thus upheld is the condition of public
education in the city of Cleveland. The record indicates that the schools are
failing to serve their objective, and the vouchers in issue here are said to be
needed to provide adequate alternatives to them. If there were an excuse for
giving short shrift to the Establishment Clause, it would probably apply here.
But there is no excuse. Constitutional limitations are placed on government to
preserve constitutional values in hard cases, like these. "[C]onstitutional lines
have to be drawn, and on one side of every one of them is an otherwise
sympathetic case that provokes impatience with the Constitution and with the
line. But constitutional lines are the price of constitutional government."
Agostini v. Felton (1997) (Souter, J., dissenting). I therefore respectfully dissent.

Robson

974

The First Amendment

The applicability of the Establishment Clause to public funding of benefits to
religious schools was settled in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing (1947), which
inaugurated the modern era of establishment doctrine. ***
Today, however, the majority holds that the Establishment Clause is not
offended by Ohio's Pilot Project Scholarship Program, under which students
may be eligible to receive as much as $2,250 in the form of tuition vouchers
transferable to religious schools. In the city of Cleveland the overwhelming
proportion of large appropriations for voucher money must be spent on
religious schools if it is to be spent at all, and will be spent in amounts that
cover almost all of tuition. The money will thus pay for eligible students'
instruction not only in secular subjects but in religion as well, in schools that
can fairly be characterized as founded to teach religious doctrine and to imbue
teaching in all subjects with a religious dimension. Public tax money will pay at
a systemic level for teaching the covenant with Israel and Mosaic law in Jewish
schools, the primacy of the Apostle Peter and the Papacy in Catholic schools,
the truth of reformed Christianity in Protestant schools, and the revelation to
the Prophet in Muslim schools, to speak only of major religious groupings in the
Republic.
How can a Court consistently leave Everson on the books and approve the Ohio
vouchers? The answer is that it cannot. It is only by ignoring Everson that the
majority can claim to rest on traditional law in its invocation of neutral aid
provisions and private choice to sanction the Ohio law. It is, moreover, only by
ignoring the meaning of neutrality and private choice themselves that the
majority can even pretend to rest today's decision on those criteria.
I
The majority's statements of Establishment Clause doctrine cannot be
appreciated without some historical perspective on the Court's announced
limitations on government aid to religious education, and its repeated
repudiation of limits previously set. ***
Viewed with the necessary generality, the cases can be categorized in three
groups. In the period from 1947 to 1968, the basic principle of no aid to religion
through school benefits was unquestioned. Thereafter for some 15 years, the
Court termed its efforts as attempts to draw a line against aid that would be
divertible to support the religious, as distinct from the secular, activity of an
institutional beneficiary. Then, starting in 1983, concern with divertibility was
gradually lost in favor of approving aid in amounts unlikely to afford
substantial benefits to religious schools, when offered evenhandedly without
regard to a recipient's religious character, and when channeled to a religious
institution only by the genuinely free choice of some private individual. Now,
the three stages are succeeded by a fourth, in which the substantial character
of government aid is held to have no constitutional significance, and the
espoused criteria of neutrality in offering aid, and private choice in directing it,
are shown to be nothing but examples of verbal formalism.

C
Hence it seems fair to say that it was not until today that substantiality of aid
has clearly been rejected as irrelevant by a majority of this Court, just as it has
not been until today that a majority, not a plurality, has held purely formal
criteria to suffice for scrutinizing aid that ends up in the coffers of religious
schools. Today's cases are notable for their stark illustration of the inadequacy
of the majority's chosen formal analysis.
II
Although it has taken half a century since Everson to reach the majority's twin
standards of neutrality and free choice, the facts show that, in the majority's
hands, even these criteria cannot convincingly legitimize the Ohio scheme.
A
Consider first the criterion of neutrality. ***
Neutrality in this sense refers, of course, to evenhandedness in setting eligibility
as between potential religious and secular recipients of public money. Thus, for
example, the aid scheme in Witters provided an eligible recipient with a
scholarship to be used at any institution within a practically unlimited universe
of schools; it did not tend to provide more or less aid depending on which one
the scholarship recipient chose, and there was no indication that the maximum
scholarship amount would be insufficient at secular schools. Neither did any
condition of Zobrest's interpreter's subsidy favor religious education.
In order to apply the neutrality test, then, it makes sense to focus on a category
of aid that may be directed to religious as well as secular schools, and ask
whether the scheme favors a religious direction. Here, one would ask whether
the voucher provisions, allowing for as much as $2,250 toward private school
tuition (or a grant to a public school in an adjacent district), were written in a
way that skewed the scheme toward benefiting religious schools.
This, however, is not what the majority asks. The majority looks not to the
provisions for tuition vouchers, but to every provision for educational
opportunity. The majority then finds confirmation that "participation of all
schools" satisfies neutrality by noting that the better part of total state
educational expenditure goes to public schools, thus showing there is no favor
of religion.
The illogic is patent. If regular, public schools (which can get no voucher
payments) "participate" in a voucher scheme with schools that can, and public
expenditure is still predominantly on public schools, then the majority's
reasoning would find neutrality in a scheme of vouchers available for private
tuition in districts with no secular private schools at all. "Neutrality" as the
majority employs the term is, literally, verbal and nothing more. This, indeed, is
the only way the majority can gloss over the very nonneutral feature of the total
scheme covering "all schools": public tutors may receive from the State no more
than $324 per child to support extra tutoring (that is, the State's 90% of a total
amount of $360), whereas the tuition voucher schools (which turn out to be
mostly religious) can receive up to $2,250.
Why the majority does not simply accept the fact that the challenge here is to
the more generous voucher scheme and judge its neutrality in relation to

Robson

976

The First Amendment

religious use of voucher money seems very odd. It seems odd, that is, until one
recognizes that comparable schools for applying the criterion of neutrality are
also the comparable schools for applying the other majority criterion, whether
the immediate recipients of voucher aid have a genuinely free choice of religious
and secular schools to receive the voucher money. And in applying this second
criterion, the consideration of "all schools" is ostensibly helpful to the majority
position.
B
The majority addresses the issue of choice the same way it addresses neutrality,
by asking whether recipients or potential recipients of voucher aid have a choice
of public schools among secular alternatives to religious schools. Again,
however, the majority asks the wrong question and misapplies the criterion.
The majority has confused choice in spending scholarships with choice from the
entire menu of possible educational placements, most of them open to anyone
willing to attend a public school. I say "confused" because the majority's new
use of the choice criterion, which it frames negatively as "whether Ohio is
coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools," ignores the
reason for having a private choice enquiry in the first place. Cases since Mueller
have found private choice relevant under a rule that aid to religious schools can
be permissible so long as it first passes through the hands of students or
parents. The majority's view that all educational choices are comparable for
purposes of choice thus ignores the whole point of the choice test: it is a
criterion for deciding whether indirect aid to a religious school is legitimate
because it passes through private hands that can spend or use the aid in a
secular school. The question is whether the private hand is genuinely free to
send the money in either a secular direction or a religious one. The majority
now has transformed this question about private choice in channeling aid into a
question about selecting from examples of state spending (on education)
including direct spending on magnet and community public schools that goes
through no private hands and could never reach a religious school under any
circumstance. When the choice test is transformed from where to spend the
money to where to go to school, it is cut loose from its very purpose.
Defining choice as choice in spending the money or channeling the aid is,
moreover, necessary if the choice criterion is to function as a limiting principle
at all. If "choice" is present whenever there is any educational alternative to the
religious school to which vouchers can be endorsed, then there will always be a
choice and the voucher can always be constitutional, even in a system in which
there is not a single private secular school as an alternative to the religious
school. And because it is unlikely that any participating private religious school
will enroll more pupils than the generally available public system, it will be easy
to generate numbers suggesting that aid to religion is not the significant intent
or effect of the voucher scheme.
That is, in fact, just the kind of rhetorical argument that the majority accepts in
these cases. ***
It is not, of course, that I think even a genuine choice criterion is up to the task
of the Establishment Clause when substantial state funds go to religious
teaching. *** The point is simply that if the majority wishes to claim that choice

Robson

977

The First Amendment

is a criterion, it must define choice in a way that can function as a criterion
with a practical capacity to screen something out.
If, contrary to the majority, we ask the right question about genuine choice to
use the vouchers, the answer shows that something is influencing choices in a
way that aims the money in a religious direction: of 56 private schools in the
district participating in the voucher program (only 53 of which accepted
voucher students in 1999-2000), 46 of them are religious; 96.6% of all voucher
recipients go to religious schools, only 3.4% to nonreligious ones. ***
Of course, the obvious fix would be to increase the value of vouchers so that
existing nonreligious private and non-Catholic religious schools would be able
to enroll more voucher students, and to provide incentives for educators to
create new such schools given that few presently exist. Private choice, if as
robust as that available to the seminarian in Witters, would then be "true
private choice" under the majority's criterion. But it is simply unrealistic to
presume that parents of elementary and middle schoolchildren in Cleveland will
have a range of secular and religious choices even arguably comparable to the
statewide program for vocational and higher education in Witters. And to get to
that hypothetical point would require that such massive financial support be
made available to religion as to disserve every objective of the Establishment
Clause even more than the present scheme does.
There is, in any case, no way to interpret the 96.6% of current voucher money
going to religious schools as reflecting a free and genuine choice by the families
that apply for vouchers. The 96.6% reflects, instead, the fact that too few
nonreligious school desks are available and few but religious schools can afford
to accept more than a handful of voucher students. And contrary to the
majority's assertion, public schools in adjacent districts hardly have a financial
incentive to participate in the Ohio voucher program, and none has. For the
overwhelming number of children in the voucher scheme, the only alternative to
the public schools is religious. And it is entirely irrelevant that the State did not
deliberately design the network of private schools for the sake of channeling
money into religious institutions. The criterion is one of genuinely free choice on
the part of the private individuals who choose, and a Hobson's choice is not a
choice, whatever the reason for being Hobsonian.
III
I do not dissent merely because the majority has misapplied its own law, for
even if I assumed arguendo that the majority's formal criteria were satisfied on
the facts, today's conclusion would be profoundly at odds with the Constitution.
Proof of this is clear on two levels. The first is circumstantial, in the now
discarded symptom of violation, the substantial dimension of the aid. The
second is direct, in the defiance of every objective supposed to be served by the
bar against establishment.
A
The scale of the aid to religious schools approved today is unprecedented, both
in the number of dollars and in the proportion of systemic school expenditure
supported. ***
The Cleveland voucher program has cost Ohio taxpayers $33 million since its
implementation in 1996 ($28 million in voucher payments, $5 million in

are on top of the textbooks, reading and math tutors, laboratory equipment,

The gross amounts of public money contributed are symptomatic of the scope of
what the taxpayers' money buys for a broad class of religious-school students.
In paying for practically the full amount of tuition for thousands of qualifying
students, the scholarships purchase everything that tuition purchases, be it
instruction in math or indoctrination in faith. ***
B
It is virtually superfluous to point out that every objective underlying the
prohibition of religious establishment is betrayed by this scheme, but
something has to be said about the enormity of the violation. *** [The first
objective,] Madison's objection to three pence has simply been lost in the
majority's formalism.

wrote of the "`experience ... that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of
maintaining the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation.'"

"corrosive secularism" to religious schools, and the specific threat is to the
primacy of the schools' mission to educate the children of the faithful according
to the unaltered precepts of their faith. Even "[t]he favored religion may be
compromised as political figures reshape the religion's beliefs for their own
purposes; it may be reformed as government largesse brings government
regulation."
The risk is already being realized. In Ohio, for example, a condition of receiving
government money under the program is that participating religious schools
may not "discriminate on the basis of ... religion," which means the school may
not give admission preferences to children who are members of the patron faith;
children of a parish are generally consigned to the same admission lotteries as
non-believers. This indeed was the exact object of a 1999 amendment repealing
the portion of a predecessor statute that had allowed an admission preference
for "[c]hildren ... whose parents are affiliated with any organization that
provides financial support to the school, at the discretion of the school." Nor is
the State's religious antidiscrimination restriction limited to student admission
policies: by its terms, a participating religious school may well be forbidden to
choose a member of its own clergy to serve as teacher or principal over a
layperson of a different religion claiming equal qualification for the job. Indeed,
a separate condition that "[t]he school ... not ... teach hatred of any person or
group on the basis of ... religion," could be understood (or subsequently
broadened) to prohibit religions from teaching traditionally legitimate articles of
faith as to the error, sinfulness, or ignorance of others, if they want government
money for their schools.

The First Amendment

For perspective on this foot-in-the-door of religious regulation, it is well to
remember that the money has barely begun to flow. *** But given the figures
already involved here, there is no question that religious schools in Ohio are on
the way to becoming bigger businesses with budgets enhanced to fit their new
stream of tax-raised income. The administrators of those same schools are also
no doubt following the politics of a move in the Ohio State Senate to raise the
current maximum value of a school voucher from $2,250 to the base amount of
current state spending on each public school student ($4,814 for the 2001
fiscal year). Ohio, in fact, is merely replicating the experience in Wisconsin,
where a similar increase in the value of educational vouchers in Milwaukee has
induced the creation of some 23 new private schools, Public Policy Forum,
Research Brief, vol. 90, no. 1, p.3 (Jan. 23, 2002), some of which, we may safely
surmise, are religious. New schools have presumably pegged their financial
prospects to the government from the start, and the odds are that increases in
government aid will bring the threshold voucher amount closer to the tuition at
even more expensive religious schools.
When government aid goes up, so does reliance on it; the only thing likely to go
down is independence. *** A day will come when religious schools will learn
what political leverage can do, just as Ohio's politicians are now getting a lesson
in the leverage exercised by religion.
Increased voucher spending is not, however, the sole portent of growing
regulation of religious practice in the school, for state mandates to moderate
religious teaching may well be the most obvious response to the third concern
behind the ban on establishment, its inextricable link with social conflict. As
appropriations for religious subsidy rise, competition for the money will tap
sectarian religion's capacity for discord. ***
Religious teaching at taxpayer expense simply cannot be cordoned from
taxpayer politics, and every major religion currently espouses social positions
that provoke intense opposition. Not all taxpaying Protestant citizens, for
example, will be content to underwrite the teaching of the Roman Catholic
Church condemning the death penalty. Nor will all of America's Muslims
acquiesce in paying for the endorsement of the religious Zionism taught in
many religious Jewish schools, which combines "a nationalistic sentiment" in
support of Israel with a "deeply religious" element. Nor will every secular
taxpayer be content to support Muslim views on differential treatment of the
sexes, or, for that matter, to fund the espousal of a wife's obligation of
obedience to her husband, presumably taught in any schools adopting the
articles of faith of the Southern Baptist Convention. Views like these, and
innumerable others, have been safe in the sectarian pulpits and classrooms of
this Nation not only because the Free Exercise Clause protects them directly,
but because the ban on supporting religious establishment has protected free
exercise, by keeping it relatively private. With the arrival of vouchers in religious
schools, that privacy will go, and along with it will go confidence that religious
disagreement will stay moderate.
If the divisiveness permitted by today's majority is to be avoided in the short
term, it will be avoided only by action of the political branches at the state and
national levels. Legislatures not driven to desperation by the problems of public
education may be able to see the threat in vouchers negotiable in sectarian

schools. Perhaps even cities with problems like Cleveland's will perceive the
danger, now that they know a federal court will not save them from it.
My own course as a judge on the Court cannot, however, simply be to hope that
the political branches will save us from the consequences of the majority's
decision. Everson's statement is still the touchstone of sound law, even though
the reality is that in the matter of educational aid the Establishment Clause has
largely been read away. True, the majority has not approved vouchers for
religious schools alone, or aid earmarked for religious instruction. But no
scheme so clumsy will ever get before us, and in the cases that we may see, like
these, the Establishment Clause is largely silenced. I do not have the option to
leave it silent, and I hope that a future Court will reconsider today's dramatic
departure from basic Establishment Clause principle.
JUSTICE BREYER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEVENS AND JUSTICE SOUTER JOIN,
DISSENTING.
I join Justice Souter's opinion, and I agree substantially with Justice Stevens. I
write separately, however, to emphasize the risk that publicly financed voucher
programs pose in terms of religiously based social conflict. I do so because I
believe that the Establishment Clause concern for protecting the Nation's social
fabric from religious conflict poses an overriding obstacle to the implementation
of this well-intentioned school voucher program. And by explaining the nature
of the concern, I hope to demonstrate why, in my view, "parental choice" cannot
significantly alleviate the constitutional problem. ***

Notes

In addition to voucher systems that have revolutionized public
education, the charter school movement has also had a great effect. As
one law review article notes, “religiously affiliated charter schools have
become fertile ground for cultivating church-state tension.”:
In 2014, the U.S. Department of Education issued non-regulatory guidance that
discusses six commonly identified entanglement issues at charter schools
including: 1) leasing buildings from churches; 2) contracting with religious
organizations for secular programming and teaching; 3) marketing charter
schools at churches; 4) marketing church events at charter schools; 5)
reopening private, parochial schools as charter schools; and 6) teaching
religiously related concepts.

Janet R. Decker, Kari A. Carr, Church-State Entanglement at Religiously
Affiliated Charter Schools, 2015 B.Y.U. Educ. & L.J. 77, 85 (2015).
Moreover, whether faith-based or not, charter schools can insulate
themselves from other First Amendment challenges. As another article
argues, charter schools want to “have it both ways”: obtaining the
benefits of public funding while circumventing constitutional rights and
protections for employees and students that apply to traditional public

Charter Schools Try to Obtain Funding of Public Schools and the Autonomy
of Private Schools, 63 EMORY L.J. 303 (2013).
Given these views, is a voucher system preferable to a charter school
system?

As we have seen, Establishment Clause doctrine had its genesis in
public education with robust development, including the Lemon test.
The next chapter considers Establishment Clause doctrine in other
public spheres, but the division between schools and other public places
is not a stark one. What principles would you expect from the Lemon
test or other doctrines to be less applicable to non-school contexts?

Recall Justice Rutledge’s statement, dissenting in the Court’s first
Establishment Clause case, Everson v. Board of Education (1947)
(Chapter 12), that “No provision of the Constitution is more closely tied
to or given content by its generating history than the religious clause of
the First Amendment. It is at once the refined product and the terse
summation of that history.”
Consider the relevance of history - - - and which histories - - - in the

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT IN WHICH BLACK, CLARK,
BRENNAN, WHITTAKER, AND STEWART, J.J. JOINED. FRANKFURTER FILED A CONCURRING OPINION
IN WHICH HARLAN, J., JOINED. DOUGLAS, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The issues in this case concern the constitutional validity of Maryland criminal
statutes, commonly known as Sunday Closing Laws or Sunday Blue Laws.
These statutes, with exceptions to be noted hereafter, generally proscribe all
labor, business and other commercial activities on Sunday. The questions
presented are whether the classifications within the statutes bring about a
denial of equal protection of the law, whether the laws are so vague as to fail to
give reasonable notice of the forbidden conduct and therefore violate due
process, and whether the statutes are laws respecting an establishment of
religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
Appellants are seven employees of a large discount department store located on
a highway in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. They were indicted for the
Sunday sale of a three-ring loose-leaf binder, a can of floor wax, a stapler and
staples, and a toy submarine in violation of Md. Ann. Code. Art. 27, 521.
Generally, this section prohibited, throughout the State, the Sunday sale of all
merchandise except the retail sale of tobacco products, confectioneries, milk,
bread, fruits, gasoline, oils, greases, drugs and medicines, and newspapers and
periodicals. Recently amended, this section also now excepts from the general
prohibition the retail sale in Anne Arundel County of all foodstuffs, automobile
and boating accessories, flowers, toilet goods, hospital supplies and souvenirs.
It now further provides that any retail establishment in Anne Arundel County
which does not employ more than one person other than the owner may operate
on Sunday.

Robson

984

The First Amendment

Although appellants were indicated only under 521, in order properly to
consider several of the broad constitutional contentions, we must examine the
whole body of Maryland Sunday laws. Several sections of the Maryland statutes
are particularly relevant to evaluation of the issues presented. Section 492 of
Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, forbids all persons from doing any work or bodily labor
on Sunday and forbids permitting children or servants to work on that day or to
engage in fishing, hunting and unlawful pastimes or recreations. The section
excepts all works of necessity and charity. Section 522 of Md. Ann. Code, Art.
27, disallows the opening or use of any dancing saloon, opera house, bowling
alley or barber shop on Sunday. However, in addition to the exceptions noted
above, Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, 509, exempts, for Anne Arundel County, the
Sunday operation of any bathing beach, bathhouse, dancing saloon and
amusement park, and activities incident thereto and retail sales of merchandise
customarily sold at, or incidental to, the operation of the aforesaid occupations
and businesses. Section 90 of Md. Ann. Code, Art. 2B, makes generally
unlawful the sale of alcoholic beverages on Sunday. However, this section, and
immediately succeeding ones, provide various immunities for the Sunday sale of
different kinds of alcoholic beverages, at different hours during the day, by
vendors holding different types of licenses, in different political divisions of the
State - particularly in Anne Arundel County.
The remaining statutory sections concern a myriad of exceptions for various
counties, districts of counties, cities and towns throughout the State. Among
the activities allowed in certain areas on Sunday are such sports as football,
baseball, golf, tennis, bowling, croquet, basketball, lacrosse, soccer, hockey,
swimming, softball, boating, fishing, skating, horseback riding, stock car racing
and pool or billiards. Other immunized activities permitted in some regions of
the State include group singing or playing of musical instruments; the
exhibition of motion pictures; dancing; the operation of recreation centers,
picnic grounds, swimming pools, skating rinks and miniature golf courses. The
taking of oysters and the hunting or killing of game is generally forbidden, but
shooting conducted by organized rod and gun clubs is permitted in one county.
In some of the subdivisions within the State, the exempted Sunday activities are
sanctioned throughout the day; in others, they may not commence until early
afternoon or evening; in many, the activities may only be conducted during the
afternoon and late in the evening. Certain localities do not permit the allowed
Sunday activity to be carried on within one hundred yards of any church where
religious services are being held. Local ordinances and regulations concerning
certain limited activities supplement the State's statutory scheme. In Anne
Arundel County, for example, slot machines, pinball machines and bingo may
be played on Sunday.
Among other things, appellants contended at the trial that the Maryland
statutes under which they were charged were contrary to the Fourteenth
Amendment for the reasons stated at the outset of this opinion. Appellants were
convicted and each was fined five dollars and costs. The Maryland Court of
Appeals affirmed; on appeal brought under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2), we noted
probable jurisdiction.

III.
The final questions for decision are whether the Maryland Sunday Closing Laws
conflict with the Federal Constitution's provisions for religious liberty. First,
appellants contend here that the statutes applicable to Anne Arundel County
violate the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion in that the statutes'
effect is to prohibit the free exercise of religion in contravention of the First
Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. But
appellants allege only economic injury to themselves; they do not allege any
infringement of their own religious freedoms due to Sunday closing. In fact, the
record is silent as to what appellants' religious beliefs are. ***
Secondly, appellants contend that the statutes violate the guarantee of
separation of church and state in that the statutes are laws respecting an
establishment of religion contrary to the First Amendment, made applicable to
the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. If the purpose of the "establishment"
clause was only to insure protection for the "free exercise" of religion, then what
we have said above concerning appellants' standing to raise the "free exercise"
contention would appear to be true here. However, the writings of Madison, who
was the First Amendment's architect, demonstrate that the establishment of a
religion was equally feared because of its tendencies to political tyranny and
subversion of civil authority. Thus, in Everson v. Board of Education (1947) the
Court permitted a district taxpayer to challenge, on "establishment" grounds, a
state statute which authorized district boards of education to reimburse
parents for fares paid for the transportation of their children to both public and
Catholic schools. Appellants here concededly have suffered direct economic
injury, allegedly due to the imposition on them of the tenets of the Christian
religion. We find that, in these circumstances, these appellants have standing
to complain that the statutes are laws respecting an establishment of religion.
The essence of appellants' "establishment" argument is that Sunday is the
Sabbath day of the predominant Christian sects; that the purpose of the
enforced stoppage of labor on that day is to facilitate and encourage church
attendance; that the purpose of setting Sunday as a day of universal rest is to
induce people with no religion or people with marginal religious beliefs to join
the predominant Christian sects; that the purpose of the atmosphere of
tranquility created by Sunday closing is to aid the conduct of church services
and religious observance of the sacred day. In substantiating their
"establishment" argument, appellants rely on the wording of the present
Maryland statutes, on earlier versions of the current Sunday laws and on prior
judicial characterizations of these laws by the Maryland Court of Appeals.
Although only the constitutionality of 521, the section under which appellants
have been convicted, is immediately before us in this litigation, inquiry into the
history of Sunday Closing Laws in our country, in addition to an examination of
the Maryland Sunday closing statutes in their entirety and of their history, is
relevant to the decision of whether the Maryland Sunday law in question is one
respecting an establishment of religion. There is no dispute that the original
laws which dealt with Sunday labor were motivated by religious forces. But

Robson

986

The First Amendment

what we must decide is whether present Sunday legislation, having undergone
extensive changes from the earliest forms, still retains its religious character.
Sunday Closing Laws go far back into American history, having been brought to
the colonies with a background of English legislation dating to the thirteenth
century. In 1237, Henry III forbade the frequenting of markets on Sunday; the
Sunday showing of wools at the staple was banned by Edward III in 1354; in
1409, Henry IV prohibited the playing of unlawful games on Sunday; Henry VI
proscribed Sunday fairs in churchyards in 1444 and, four years later, made
unlawful all fairs and markets and all showings of any goods or merchandise;
Edward VI disallowed Sunday bodily labor by several injunctions in the midsixteenth century; various Sunday sports and amusements were restricted in
1625 by Charles I. Lewis, A Critical History of Sunday Legislation, 82-108;
Johnson and Yost, Separation of Church and State, 221. The law of the colonies
to the time of the Revolution and the basis of the Sunday laws in the States was
29 CHARLES II, C. 7 (1677). It provided, in part:
"For the better observation and keeping holy the Lord's day, commonly called
Sunday: be it enacted . . . that all the laws enacted and in force concerning the
observation of the day, and repairing to the church thereon, be carefully put in
execution; and that all and every person and persons whatsoever shall upon
every Lord's day apply themselves to the observation of the same, by exercising
themselves thereon in the duties of piety and true religion, publicly and
privately; and that no tradesman, artificer, workman, laborer, or other person
whatsoever, shall do or exercise any worldly labor or business or work of their
ordinary callings upon the Lord's day, or any part thereof (works of necessity
and charity only excepted); . . . and that no person or persons whatsoever shall
publicly cry, show forth, or expose for sale any wares, merchandise, fruit, herbs,
goods, or chattels, whatsoever, upon the Lord's day, or any part thereof. . . ."

(Emphasis added.)
Observation of the above language, and of that of the prior mandates, reveals
clearly that the English Sunday legislation was in aid of the established church.
The American colonial Sunday restrictions arose soon after settlement. Starting
in 1650, the Plymouth Colony proscribed servile work, unnecessary travelling,
sports, and the sale of alcoholic beverages on the Lord's day and enacted laws
concerning church attendance. The Massachusetts Bay Colony and the
Connecticut and New Haven Colonies enacted similar prohibitions, some even
earlier in the seventeenth century. The religious orientation of the colonial
statutes was equally apparent. For example, a 1629 Massachusetts Bay
instruction began, "And to the end the Sabbath may be celebrated in a religious
manner. . . ." A 1653 enactment spoke of Sunday activities "which things tend
much to the dishonor of God, the reproach of religion, and the profanation of
his holy Sabbath, the sanctification whereof is sometimes put for all duties
immediately respecting the service of God. . . ." These laws persevered after the
Revolution and, at about the time of the First Amendment's adoption, each of
the colonies had laws of some sort restricting Sunday labor.
But, despite the strongly religious origin of these laws, beginning before the
eighteenth century, nonreligious arguments for Sunday closing began to be
heard more distinctly and the statutes began to lose some of their totally
religious flavor. In the middle 1700's, Blackstone wrote, "[T]he keeping one day

Robson

987

The First Amendment

in the seven holy, as a time of relaxation and refreshment as well as for public
worship, is of admirable service to a state considered merely as a civil
institution. It humanizes, by the help of conversation and society, the manners
of the lower classes; which would otherwise degenerate into a sordid ferocity
and savage selfishness of spirit; it enables the industrious workman to pursue
his occupation in the ensuing week with health and cheerfulness." A 1788
English statute dealing with chimney sweeps, 28 Geo. III, c. 48, in addition to
providing for their Sunday religious affairs, also regulated their hours of work.
The preamble to a 1679 Rhode Island enactment stated that the reason for the
ban on Sunday employment was that "persons being evill minded, have
presumed to employ in servile labor, more than necessity requireth, their
servants. . . ." The New York law of 1788 omitted the term "Lord's day" and
substituted "the first day of the week commonly called Sunday." Similar
changes marked the Maryland statutes, discussed below. With the advent of the
First Amendment, the colonial provisions requiring church attendance were
soon repealed.
More recently, further secular justifications have been advanced for making
Sunday a day of rest, a day when people may recover from the labors of the
week just passed and may physically and mentally prepare for the week's work
to come. In England, during the First World War, a committee investigating the
health conditions of munitions workers reported that "if the maximum output is
to be secured and maintained for any length of time, a weekly period of rest
must be allowed. . . . On economic and social grounds alike this weekly period
of rest is best provided on Sunday."
The proponents of Sunday closing legislation are no longer exclusively
representatives of religious interests. Recent New Jersey Sunday legislation was
supported by labor groups and trade associations; modern English Sunday
legislation was promoted by the National Federation of Grocers and supported
by the National Chamber of Trade, the Drapers' Chamber of Trade, and the
National Union of Shop Assistants.
Throughout the years, state legislatures have modified, deleted from and added
to their Sunday statutes. As evidenced by the New Jersey laws mentioned above,
current changes are commonplace. Almost every State in our country presently
has some type of Sunday regulation and over forty possess a relatively
comprehensive system. Some of our States now enforce their Sunday legislation
through Departments of Labor. Thus have Sunday laws evolved from the wholly
religious sanctions that originally were enacted.
Moreover, litigation over Sunday closing laws is not novel. Scores of cases may
be found in the state appellate courts relating to sundry phases of Sunday
enactments. Religious objections have been raised there on numerous
occasions but sustained only once, in Ex parte Newman, 9 Cal. 502 (1858); and
that decision was overruled three years later, in Ex parte Andrews, 18 Cal. 678.
A substantial number of cases in varying postures bearing on state Sunday
legislation have reached this Court. 13 Although none raising the issues now
presented have gained plenary hearing, language used in some of these cases
further evidences the evolution of Sunday laws as temporal statutes. Mr.
Justice Field wrote in Soon Hing v. Crowley (1885)

Robson

988

The First Amendment

"Laws setting aside Sunday as a day of rest are upheld, not from any right of the
government to legislate for the promotion of religious observances, but from its
right to protect all persons from the physical and moral debasement which
comes from uninterrupted labor. Such laws have always been deemed beneficent
and merciful laws, especially to the poor and dependent, to the laborers in our
factories and workshops and in the heated rooms of our cities; and their validity
has been sustained by the highest courts of the States."

***
Before turning to the Maryland legislation now here under attack, an
investigation of what historical position Sunday Closing Laws have occupied
with reference to the First Amendment should be undertaken, Everson v. Board
of Education.
This Court has considered the happenings surrounding the Virginia General
Assembly's enactment of "An act for establishing religious freedom," written by
Thomas Jefferson and sponsored by James Madison, as best reflecting the long
and intensive struggle for religious freedom in America, as particularly relevant
in the search for the First Amendment's meaning. See Everson v. Board of
Education. In 1776, nine years before the bill's passage, Madison co-authored
Virginia's Declaration of Rights which provided, inter alia, that "all men are
equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of
conscience. . . ." Virginia had had Sunday legislation since early in the
seventeenth century; in 1776, the laws penalizing "maintaining any opinions in
matters of religion, forbearing to repair to church, or the exercising any mode of
worship whatsoever" (emphasis added), were repealed, and all dissenters were
freed from the taxes levied for the support of the established church. The
Sunday labor prohibitions remained; apparently, they were not believed to be
inconsistent with the newly enacted Declaration of Rights. Madison had sought
also to have the Declaration expressly condemn the existing Virginia
establishment. This hope was finally realized when "A Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom" was passed in 1785. In this same year, Madison presented
to Virginia legislators "A Bill for Punishing . . . Sabbath Breakers" which
provided, in part:
"If any person on Sunday shall himself be found labouring at his own or any
other trade or calling, or shall employ his apprentices, servants or slaves in
labour, or other business, except it be in the ordinary household offices of daily
necessity, or other work of necessity or charity, he shall forfeit the sum of ten
shillings for every such offence, deeming every apprentice, servant, or slave so
employed, and every day he shall be so employed as constituting a distinct
offence."

This became law the following year and remained during the time that Madison
fought for the First Amendment in the Congress. ***
In the case at bar, we find the place of Sunday Closing Laws in the First
Amendment's history both enlightening and persuasive.
But in order to dispose of the case before us, we must consider the standards
by which the Maryland statutes are to be measured. ***
Thus, this Court has given the Amendment a "broad interpretation . . . in the
light of its history and the evils it was designed forever to suppress. . . ."

Robson

989

The First Amendment

Everson v. Board of Education. It has found that the First and Fourteenth
Amendments afford protection against religious establishment far more
extensive than merely to forbid a national or state church. Thus, in McCollum v.
Board of Education, the Court held that the action of a board of education,
permitting religious instruction during school hours in public school buildings
and requiring those children who chose not to attend to remain in their
classrooms, to be contrary to the "Establishment" Clause.
However, it is equally true that the "Establishment" Clause does not ban federal
or state regulation of conduct whose reason or effect merely happens to
coincide or harmonize with the tenets of some or all religions. In many
instances, the Congress or state legislatures conclude that the general welfare
of society, wholly apart from any religious considerations, demands such
regulation. Thus, for temporal purposes, murder is illegal. And the fact that this
agrees with the dictates of the Judeo-Christian religions while it may disagree
with others does not invalidate the regulation. So too with the questions of
adultery and polygamy. The same could be said of theft, fraud, etc., because
those offenses were also proscribed in the Decalogue.
Thus, these broad principles have been set forth by this Court. Those cases
dealing with the specific problems arising under the "Establishment" Clause
which have reached this Court are few in number. The most extensive
discussion of the "Establishment" Clause's latitude is to be found in Everson v.
Board of Education (1947). ***
In light of the evolution of our Sunday Closing Laws through the centuries, and
of their more or less recent emphasis upon secular considerations, it is not
difficult to discern that as presently written and administered, most of them, at
least, are of a secular rather than of a religious character, and that presently
they bear no relationship to establishment of religion as those words are used
in the Constitution of the United States.
Throughout this century and longer, both the federal and state governments
have oriented their activities very largely toward improvement of the health,
safety, recreation and general well-being of our citizens. Numerous laws
affecting public health, safety factors in industry, laws affecting hours and
conditions of labor of women and children, week-end diversion at parks and
beaches, and cultural activities of various kinds, now point the way toward the
good life for all. Sunday Closing Laws, like those before us, have become part
and parcel of this great governmental concern wholly apart from their original
purposes or connotations. The present purpose and effect of most of them is to
provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens; the fact that this day is Sunday, a
day of particular significance for the dominant Christian sects, does not bar the
State from achieving its secular goals. To say that the States cannot prescribe
Sunday as a day of rest for these purposes solely because centuries ago such
laws had their genesis in religion would give a constitutional interpretation of
hostility to the public welfare rather than one of mere separation of church and
State.
We now reach the Maryland statutes under review. The title of the major series
of sections of the Maryland Code dealing with Sunday closing - Art. 27, 492534C - is "Sabbath Breaking"; 492 proscribes work or bodily labor on the

Robson

990

The First Amendment

"Lord's day," and forbids persons to "profane the Lord's day" by gaming, fishing
et cetera; 522 refers to Sunday as the "Sabbath day." As has been mentioned
above, many of the exempted Sunday activities in the various localities of the
State may only be conducted during the afternoon and late evening; most
Christian church services, of course, are held on Sunday morning and early
Sunday evening. Finally, as previously noted, certain localities do not permit
the allowed Sunday activities to be carried on within one hundred yards of any
church where religious services are being held. This is the totality of the
evidence of religious purpose which may be gleaned from the face of the present
statute and from its operative effect.
The predecessors of the existing Maryland Sunday laws are undeniably
religious in origin. The first Maryland statute dealing with Sunday activities,
enacted in 1649, was entitled "An Act concerning Religion." ***
Considering the language and operative effect of the current statutes, we no
longer find the blanket prohibition against Sunday work or bodily labor. To the
contrary, we find that 521 of Art. 27, the section which appellants violated,
permits the Sunday sale of tobaccos and sweets and a long list of sundry
articles which we have enumerated above; we find that 509 of Art. 27 permits
the Sunday operation of bathing beaches, amusement parks and similar
facilities; we find that Art. 2B, 28, permits the Sunday sale of alcoholic
beverages, products strictly forbidden by predecessor statutes; we are told that
Anne Arundel County allows Sunday bingo and the Sunday playing of pinball
machines and slot machines, activities generally condemned by prior Maryland
Sunday legislation. Certainly, these are not works of charity or necessity.
Section 521's current stipulation that shops with only one employee may
remain open on Sunday does not coincide with a religious purpose. These
provisions, along with those which permit various sports and entertainments on
Sunday, seem clearly to be fashioned for the purpose of providing a Sunday
atmosphere of recreation, cheerfulness, repose and enjoyment. Coupled with
the general proscription against other types of work, we believe that the air of
the day is one of relaxation rather than one of religion.
The existing Maryland Sunday laws are not simply verbatim re-enactments of
their religiously oriented antecedents. Only 492 retains the appellation of
"Lord's day" and even that section no longer makes recitation of religious
purpose. It does talk in terms of "profan[ing] the Lord's day," but other sections
permit the activities previously thought to be profane. Prior denunciation of
Sunday drunkenness is now gone. Contemporary concern with these statutes is
evidenced by the dozen changes made in 1959 and by the recent enactment of a
majority of the exceptions.
Finally, the relevant pronouncements of the Maryland Court of Appeals dispel
any argument that the statutes' announced purpose is religious. ***
And the Maryland court declared in its decision in the instant case: "The
legislative plan is plain. It is to compel a day of rest from work, permitting only
activities which are necessary or recreational."
After engaging in the close scrutiny demanded of us when First Amendment
liberties are at issue, we accept the State Supreme Court's determination that

Robson

991

The First Amendment

the statutes' present purpose and effect is not to aid religion but to set aside a
day of rest and recreation.
But this does not answer all of appellants' contentions. We are told that the
State has other means at its disposal to accomplish its secular purpose, other
courses that would not even remotely or incidentally give state aid to religion.
On this basis, we are asked to hold these statutes invalid on the ground that
the State's power to regulate conduct in the public interest may only be
executed in a way that does not unduly or unnecessarily infringe upon the
religious provisions of the First Amendment. However relevant this argument
may be, we believe that the factual basis on which it rests is not supportable. It
is true that if the State's interest were simply to provide for its citizens a
periodic respite from work, a regulation demanding that everyone rest one day
in seven, leaving the choice of the day to the individual, would suffice.
However, the State's purpose is not merely to provide a one-day-in-seven work
stoppage. In addition to this, the State seeks to set one day apart from all
others as a day of rest, repose, recreation and tranquility - a day which all
members of the family and community have the opportunity to spend and enjoy
together, a day on which there exists relative quiet and disassociation from the
everyday intensity of commercial activities, a day on which people may visit
friends and relatives who are not available during working days.
Obviously, a State is empowered to determine that a rest-one-day-in-seven
statute would not accomplish this purpose; that it would not provide for a
general cessation of activity, a special atmosphere of tranquility, a day which all
members of the family or friends and relatives might spend together.
Furthermore, it seems plain that the problems involved in enforcing such a
provision would be exceedingly more difficult than those in enforcing a
common-day-of-rest provision.
Moreover, it is common knowledge that the first day of the week has come to
have special significance as a rest day in this country. People of all religions and
people with no religion regard Sunday as a time for family activity, for visiting
friends and relatives, for late sleeping, for passive and active entertainments, for
dining out, and the like. "Vast masses of our people, in fact, literally millions, go
out into the countryside on fine Sunday afternoons in the Summer. . . ."
Sunday is a day apart from all others. The cause is irrelevant; the fact exists. It
would seem unrealistic for enforcement purposes and perhaps detrimental to
the general welfare to require a State to choose a common day of rest other than
that which most persons would select of their own accord. For these reasons,
we hold that the Maryland statutes are not laws respecting an establishment of
religion.
The distinctions between the statutes in the case before us and the state action
in McCollum v. Board of Education, the only case in this Court finding a violation
of the "Establishment" Clause, lend further substantiation to our conclusion. In
McCollum, state action permitted religious instruction in public school buildings
during school hours and required students not attending the religious
instruction to remain in their classrooms during that time. The Court found
that this system had the effect of coercing the children to attend religious
classes; no such coercion to attend church services is present in the situation

Robson

992

The First Amendment

at bar. In McCollum, the only alternative available to the nonattending students
was to remain in their classrooms; the alternatives open to nonlaboring persons
in the instant case are far more diverse. In McCollum, there was direct
cooperation between state officials and religious ministers; no such direct
participation exists under the Maryland laws. In McCollum, tax-supported
buildings were used to aid religion; in the instant case, no tax monies are being
used in aid of religion.
Finally, we should make clear that this case deals only with the
constitutionality of 521 of the Maryland statute before us. We do not hold that
Sunday legislation may not be a violation of the "Establishment" Clause if it can
be demonstrated that its purpose - evidenced either on the face of the
legislation, in conjunction with its legislative history, or in its operative effect is to use the State's coercive power to aid religion.
Accordingly, the decision is
Affirmed.
SEPARATE OPINION OF JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, WHOM JUSTICE HARLAN JOINS.
For me considerations are determinative here which call for separate statement.
The long history of Sunday legislation, so decisive if we are to view the statutes
now attacked in a perspective wider than that which is furnished by our own
necessarily limited outlook, cannot be conveyed by a partial recital of isolated
instances or events. The importance of that history derives from its continuity
and fullness - from the massive testimony which it bears to the evolution of
statutes controlling Sunday labor and to the forces which have, during three
hundred years of Anglo-American history at the least, changed those laws,
transmuted them, made them the vehicle of mixed and complicated aspirations.
Since I find in the history of these statutes insights controllingly relevant to the
constitutional issues before us, I am constrained to set that history forth in
detail. ***
JUSTICE DOUGLAS, DISSENTING.
The question is not whether one day out of seven can be imposed by a State as
a day of rest. The question is not whether Sunday can by force of custom and
habit be retained as a day of rest. The question is whether a State can impose
criminal sanctions on those who, unlike the Christian majority that makes up
our society, worship on a different day or do not share the religious scruples of
the majority.
*** I do not see how a State can make protesting citizens refrain from doing
innocent acts on Sunday because the doing of those acts offends sentiments of
their Christian neighbors.
The institutions of our society are founded on the belief that there is an
authority higher than the authority of the State; that there is a moral law which
the State is powerless to alter; that the individual possesses rights, conferred by
the Creator, which government must respect. The Declaration of Independence
[provides] ***

Robson

993

The First Amendment

The Puritan influence helped shape our constitutional law and our common law
as Dean Pound has said: The Puritan "put individual conscience and individual
judgment in the first place." THE SPIRIT OF THE COMMON LAW (1921). For these
reasons we stated in Zorach v. Clauson, "We are a religious people whose
institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."
But those who fashioned the First Amendment decided that if and when God is
to be served, His service will not be motivated by coercive measures of
government. "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" - *** This means, as I
understand it, that if a religious leaven is to be worked into the affairs of our
people, it is to be done by individuals and groups, not by the Government. This
necessarily means, first, that the dogma, creed, scruples, or practices of no
religious group or sect are to be preferred over those of any others; second, that
no one shall be interfered with by government for practicing the religion of his
choice; third, that the State may not require anyone to practice a religion or
even any religion; and fourth, that the State cannot compel one so to conduct
himself as not to offend the religious scruples of another. The idea, as I
understand it, was to limit the power of government to act in religious matters,
not to limit the freedom of religious men to act religiously nor to restrict the
freedom of atheists or agnostics.
The First Amendment commands government to have no interest in theology or
ritual; it admonishes government to be interested in allowing religious freedom
to flourish - whether the result is to produce Catholics, Jews, or Protestants, or
to turn the people toward the path of Buddha, or to end in a predominantly
Moslem nation, or to produce in the long run atheists or agnostics. On matters
of this kind government must be neutral. This freedom plainly includes freedom
from religion with the right to believe, speak, write, publish and advocate
antireligious programs. Certainly the "free exercise" clause does not require that
everyone embrace the theology of some church or of some faith, or observe the
religious practices of any majority or minority sect. The First Amendment by its
"establishment" clause prevents, of course, the selection by government of an
"official" church. Yet the ban plainly extends farther than that. ***
The "establishment" clause protects citizens also against any law which selects
any religious custom, practice, or ritual, puts the force of government behind it,
and fines, imprisons, or otherwise penalizes a person for not observing it. The
Government plainly could not join forces with one religious group and decree a
universal and symbolic circumcision. Nor could it require all children to be
baptized or give tax exemptions only to those whose children were baptized.
Could it require a fast from sunrise to sunset throughout the Moslem month of
Ramadan? I should think not. Yet why then can it make criminal the doing of
other acts, as innocent as eating, during the day that Christians revere?
Sunday is a word heavily overlaid with connotations and traditions deriving
from the Christian roots of our civilization that color all judgments concerning it.
This is what the philosophers call "word magic." ***
The issue of these cases would therefore be in better focus if we imagined that a
state legislature, controlled by orthodox Jews and Seventh-Day Adventists,
passed a law making it a crime to keep a shop open on Saturdays. Would a

Robson

994

The First Amendment

Baptist, Catholic, Methodist, or Presbyterian be compelled to obey that law or
go to jail or pay a fine? Or suppose Moslems grew in political strength here and
got a law through a state legislature making it a crime to keep a shop open on
Fridays. Would the rest of us have to submit under the fear of criminal
sanctions?
*** This religious influence has extended far, far back of the First and
Fourteenth Amendments. Every Sunday School student knows the Fourth
Commandment:
"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

*** The State can, of course, require one day of rest a week: one day when every
shop or factory is closed. Quite a few States make that requirement. Then the
"day of rest" becomes purely and simply a health measure. But the Sunday laws
operate differently. They force minorities to obey the majority's religious feelings
of what is due and proper for a Christian community; they provide a coercive
spur to the "weaker brethren," to those who are indifferent to the claims of a
Sabbath through apathy or scruple. Can there by any doubt that Christians,
now aligned vigorously in favor of these laws, would be as strongly opposed if
they were prosecuted under a Moslem law that forbade them from engaging in
secular activities on days that violated Moslem scruples?
There is an "establishment" of religion in the constitutional sense if any practice
of any religious group has the sanction of law behind it. There is an interference
with the "free exercise" of religion if what in conscience one can do or omit doing
is required because of the religious scruples of the community. Hence I would
declare each of those laws unconstitutional as applied to the complaining
parties, whether or not they are members of a sect which observes as its
Sabbath a day other than Sunday. ***

MARSHALL, J., JOINED. STEVENS, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
The question presented is whether the Nebraska Legislature's practice of
opening each legislative day with a prayer by a chaplain paid by the State
violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
I
The Nebraska Legislature begins each of its sessions with a prayer offered by a
chaplain who is chosen biennially by the Executive Board of the Legislative
Council and paid out of public funds. Robert E. Palmer, a Presbyterian
minister, has served as chaplain since 1965 at a salary of $319.75 per month
for each month the legislature is in session.

Robson

995

The First Amendment

Ernest Chambers is a member of the Nebraska Legislature and a taxpayer of
Nebraska. Claiming that the Nebraska Legislature's chaplaincy practice violates
the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, he brought this action
under 42 U.S.C. 1983, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the practice. After
denying a motion to dismiss on the ground of legislative immunity, the District
Court held that the Establishment Clause was not breached by the prayers, but
was violated by paying the chaplain from public funds. It therefore enjoined the
legislature from using public funds to pay the chaplain; it declined to enjoin the
policy of beginning sessions with prayers. Cross-appeals were taken.
The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected arguments that the case
should be dismissed on Tenth Amendment, legislative immunity, standing, or
federalism grounds. On the merits of the chaplaincy issue, the court refused to
treat respondent's challenges as separable issues as the District Court had
done. Instead, the Court of Appeals assessed the practice as a whole because
"[p]arsing out [the] elements" would lead to "an incongruous result."
Applying the three-part test of Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) *** the court held that
the chaplaincy practice violated all three elements of the test: the purpose and
primary effect of selecting the same minister for 16 years and publishing his
prayers was to promote a particular religious expression; use of state money for
compensation and publication led to entanglement. Accordingly, the Court of
Appeals modified the District Court's injunction and prohibited the State from
engaging in any aspect of its established chaplaincy practice.
We granted certiorari limited to the challenge to the practice of opening sessions
with prayers by a state-employed clergyman and we reverse.
II
The opening of sessions of legislative and other deliberative public bodies with
prayer is deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country. From
colonial times through the founding of the Republic and ever since, the practice
of legislative prayer has coexisted with the principles of disestablishment and
religious freedom. In the very courtrooms in which the United States District
Judge and later three Circuit Judges heard and decided this case, the
proceedings opened with an announcement that concluded, "God save the
United States and this Honorable Court." The same invocation occurs at all
sessions of this Court.
The tradition in many of the Colonies was, of course, linked to an established
church, but the Continental Congress, beginning in 1774, adopted the
traditional procedure of opening its sessions with a prayer offered by a paid
chaplain. Although prayers were not offered during the Constitutional
Convention, the First Congress, as one of its early items of business, adopted
the policy of selecting a chaplain to open each session with prayer. ***
On September 25, 1789, three days after Congress authorized the appointment
of paid chaplains, final agreement was reached on the language of the Bill of
Rights. Clearly the men who wrote the First Amendment Religion Clauses did
not view paid legislative chaplains and opening prayers as a violation of that
Amendment, for the practice of opening sessions with prayer has continued
without interruption ever since that early session of Congress. It has also been
followed consistently in most of the states, including Nebraska, where the

Robson

996

The First Amendment

institution of opening legislative sessions with prayer was adopted even before
the State attained statehood.
Standing alone, historical patterns cannot justify contemporary violations of
constitutional guarantees, but there is far more here than simply historical
patterns. In this context, historical evidence sheds light not only on what the
draftsmen intended the Establishment Clause to mean, but also on how they
thought that Clause applied to the practice authorized by the First Congress their actions reveal their intent. ***
No more is Nebraska's practice of over a century, consistent with two centuries
of national practice, to be cast aside. It can hardly be thought that in the same
week Members of the First Congress voted to appoint and to pay a chaplain for
each House and also voted to approve the draft of the First Amendment for
submission to the states, they intended the Establishment Clause of the
Amendment to forbid what they had just declared acceptable. ***
This unique history leads us to accept the interpretation of the First
Amendment draftsmen who saw no real threat to the Establishment Clause
arising from a practice of prayer similar to that now challenged. We conclude
that legislative prayer presents no more potential for establishment than the
provision of school transportation, Everson v. Board of Education (1947),
beneficial grants for higher education, Tilton v. Richardson (1971), or tax
exemptions for religious organizations, Walz v. Tax Commission of City of New
York (1970).
*** We do not agree that evidence of opposition to a measure weakens the force
of the historical argument; indeed it infuses it with power by demonstrating
that the subject was considered carefully and the action not taken
thoughtlessly, by force of long tradition and without regard to the problems
posed by a pluralistic society. Jay and Rutledge specifically grounded their
objection on the fact that the delegates to the Congress "were so divided in
religious sentiments . . . that [they] could not join in the same act of worship."
Their objection was met by Samuel Adams, who stated that "he was no bigot,
and could hear a prayer from a gentleman of piety and virtue, who was at the
same time a friend to his country."
This interchange emphasizes that the delegates did not consider opening
prayers as a proselytizing activity or as symbolically placing the government's
"official seal of approval on one religious view." Rather, the Founding Fathers
looked at invocations as "conduct whose . . . effect . . . harmonize[d] with the
tenets of some or all religions." McGowan v. Maryland (1961). The
Establishment Clause does not always bar a state from regulating conduct
simply because it "harmonizes with religious canons." Here, the individual
claiming injury by the practice is an adult, presumably not readily susceptible
to "religious indoctrination” or peer pressure.
In light of the unambiguous and unbroken history of more than 200 years,
there can be no doubt that the practice of opening legislative sessions with
prayer has become part of the fabric of our society. To invoke Divine guidance
on a public body entrusted with making the laws is not, in these
circumstances, an "establishment" of religion or a step toward establishment; it
is simply a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of

Robson

997

The First Amendment

this country. As Justice Douglas observed, "[w]e are a religious people whose
institutions presuppose a Supreme Being." Zorach v. Clauson (1952).
III
We turn then to the question of whether any features of the Nebraska practice
violate the Establishment Clause. Beyond the bare fact that a prayer is offered,
three points have been made: first, that a clergyman of only one denomination Presbyterian - has been selected for 16 years; second, that the chaplain is paid
at public expense; and third, that the prayers are in the Judeo-Christian
tradition. Weighed against the historical background, these factors do not serve
to invalidate Nebraska's practice.
The Court of Appeals was concerned that Palmer's long tenure has the effect of
giving preference to his religious views. We cannot, any more than Members of
the Congresses of this century, perceive any suggestion that choosing a
clergyman of one denomination advances the beliefs of a particular church. To
the contrary, the evidence indicates that Palmer was reappointed because his
performance and personal qualities were acceptable to the body appointing him.
Palmer was not the only clergyman heard by the legislature; guest chaplains
have officiated at the request of various legislators and as substitutes during
Palmer's absences. Absent proof that the chaplain's reappointment stemmed
from an impermissible motive, we conclude that his long tenure does not in
itself conflict with the Establishment Clause.
Nor is the compensation of the chaplain from public funds a reason to
invalidate the Nebraska Legislature's chaplaincy; remuneration is grounded in
historic practice initiated, as we noted earlier, by the same Congress that
drafted the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The Continental
Congress paid its chaplain, as did some of the states. Currently, many state
legislatures and the United States Congress provide compensation for their
chaplains. Nebraska has paid its chaplain for well over a century. The content
of the prayer is not of concern to judges where, as here, there is no indication
that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or advance any
one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief. That being so, it is not for us to
embark on a sensitive evaluation or to parse the content of a particular prayer.
We do not doubt the sincerity of those, who like respondent, believe that to have
prayer in this context risks the beginning of the establishment the Founding
Fathers feared. But this concern is not well founded***
The unbroken practice for two centuries in the National Congress and for more
than a century in Nebraska and in many other states gives abundant assurance
that there is no real threat "while this Court sits."
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE MARSHALL JOINS, DISSENTING.
The Court today has written a narrow and, on the whole, careful opinion. In
effect, the Court holds that officially sponsored legislative prayer, primarily on
account of its "unique history," is generally exempted from the First

Robson

998

The First Amendment

Amendment's prohibition against "an establishment of religion." The Court's
opinion is consistent with dictum in at least one of our prior decisions, and its
limited rationale should pose little threat to the overall fate of the
Establishment Clause. Moreover, disagreement with the Court requires that I
confront the fact that some 20 years ago, in a concurring opinion in one of the
cases striking down official prayer and ceremonial Bible reading in the public
schools, I came very close to endorsing essentially the result reached by the
Court today. [Abington School Dist. v. Schempp (1963)]. Nevertheless, after much
reflection, I have come to the conclusion that I was wrong then and that the
Court is wrong today. I now believe that the practice of official invocational
prayer, as it exists in Nebraska and most other state legislatures, is
unconstitutional. It is contrary to the doctrine as well the underlying purposes
of the Establishment Clause, and it is not saved either by its history or by any
of the other considerations suggested in the Court's opinion.
I respectfully dissent.
I
The most commonly cited formulation of prevailing Establishment Clause
doctrine is found in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971):
"Every analysis in this area must begin with consideration of the cumulative
criteria developed by the Court over many years. Three such tests may be
gleaned from our cases. First, the statute [at issue] must have a secular
legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that
neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster `an
excessive government entanglement with religion.'"

That the "purpose" of legislative prayer is pre-eminently religious rather than
secular seems to me to be self-evident. "To invoke Divine guidance on a public
body entrusted with making the laws," is nothing but a religious act. Moreover,
whatever secular functions legislative prayer might play - formally opening the
legislative session, getting the members of the body to quiet down, and imbuing
them with a sense of seriousness and high purpose - could so plainly be
performed in a purely nonreligious fashion that to claim a secular purpose for
the prayer is an insult to the perfectly honorable individuals who instituted and
continue the practice.
The "primary effect" of legislative prayer is also clearly religious. As we said in
the context of officially sponsored prayers in the public schools, "prescribing a
particular form of religious worship," even if the individuals involved have the
choice not to participate, places "indirect coercive pressure upon religious
minorities to conform to the prevailing officially approved religion . . . ." Engel v.
Vitale (1962). More importantly, invocations in Nebraska's legislative halls
explicitly link religious belief and observance to the power and prestige of the
State. "[T]he mere appearance of a joint exercise of legislative authority by
Church and State provides a significant symbolic benefit to religion in the
minds of some by reason of the power conferred."
Finally, there can be no doubt that the practice of legislative prayer leads to
excessive "entanglement" between the State and religion. Lemon pointed out
that "entanglement" can take two forms: First, a state statute or program might
involve the state impermissibly in monitoring and overseeing religious affairs. In

Robson

999

The First Amendment

the case of legislative prayer, the process of choosing a "suitable" chaplain,
whether on a permanent or rotating basis, and insuring that the chaplain limits
himself or herself to "suitable" prayers, involves precisely the sort of supervision
that agencies of government should if at all possible avoid.
Second, excessive "entanglement" might arise out of "the divisive political
potential" of a state statute or program. *** In this case, this second aspect of
entanglement is also clear. The controversy between Senator Chambers and his
colleagues, which had reached the stage of difficulty and rancor long before this
lawsuit was brought, has split the Nebraska Legislature precisely on issues of
religion and religious conformity. The record in this case also reports a series of
instances, involving legislators other than Senator Chambers, in which
invocations by Reverend Palmer and others led to controversy along religious
lines. And in general, the history of legislative prayer has been far more eventful
- and divisive - than a hasty reading of the Court's opinion might indicate.
In sum, I have no doubt that, if any group of law students were asked to apply
the principles of Lemon to the question of legislative prayer, they would nearly
unanimously find the practice to be unconstitutional.
II
The path of formal doctrine, however, can only imperfectly capture the nature
and importance of the issues at stake in this case. A more adequate analysis
must therefore take into account the underlying function of the Establishment
Clause, and the forces that have shaped its doctrine. ***
A
[omitted]
B
The imperatives of separation and neutrality are not limited to the relationship
of government to religious institutions or denominations, but extend as well to
the relationship of government to religious beliefs and practices. In Torcaso v.
Watkins (1961), for example, we struck down a state provision requiring a
religious oath as a qualification to hold office, not only because it violated
principles of free exercise of religion, but also because it violated the principles
of nonestablishment of religion. And, of course, in the pair of cases that hang
over this one like a reproachful set of parents, we held that official prayer and
prescribed Bible reading in the public schools represent a serious
encroachment on the Establishment Clause. As we said in Engel, "[i]t is neither
sacrilegious nor anti-religious to say that each separate government in this
country should stay out of the business of writing or sanctioning official prayers
and leave that purely religious function to the people themselves and to those
the people choose to look to for religious guidance."
Nor should it be thought that this view of the Establishment Clause is a recent
concoction of an overreaching judiciary. Even before the First Amendment was
written, the Framers of the Constitution broke with the practice of the Articles
of Confederation and many state constitutions, and did not invoke the name of
God in the document. This "omission of a reference to the Deity was not
inadvertent; nor did it remain unnoticed." Moreover, Thomas Jefferson and
Andrew Jackson, during their respective terms as President, both refused on

Robson

1000

The First Amendment

Establishment Clause grounds to declare national days of thanksgiving or
fasting. And James Madison, writing subsequent to his own Presidency on
essentially the very issue we face today, stated:
"Is the appointment of Chaplains to the two Houses of Congress consistent with
the Constitution, and with the pure principle of religious freedom?
"In strictness, the answer on both points must be in the negative. The
Constitution of the U.S. forbids everything like an establishment of a national
religion. The law appointing Chaplains establishes a religious worship for the
national representatives, to be performed by Ministers of religion, elected by a
majority of them; and these are to be paid out of the national taxes. Does not
this involve the principle of a national establishment, applicable to a provision
for a religious worship for the Constituent as well as of the representative Body,
approved by the majority, and conducted by Ministers of religion paid by the
entire nation."

that are embedded within the Establishment Clause. ***

The argument is made occasionally that a strict separation of religion and state
robs the Nation of its spiritual identity. I believe quite the contrary. It may be
true that individuals cannot be "neutral" on the question of religion But the
judgment of the Establishment Clause is that neutrality by the organs of
government on questions of religion is both possible and imperative. Alexis de
Tocqueville wrote the following concerning his travels through this land in the
early 1830's:
"The religious atmosphere of the country was the first thing that struck me on
arrival in the United States. . . .
"In France I had seen the spirits of religion and of freedom almost always
marching in opposite directions. In America I found them intimately linked
together in joint reign over the same land.
"My longing to understand the reason for this phenomenon increased daily.
"To find this out, I questioned the faithful of all communions; I particularly
sought the society of clergymen, who are the depositaries of the various creeds
and have a personal interest in their survival. . . . I expressed my astonishment
and revealed my doubts to each of them; I found that they all agreed with each
other except about details; all thought that the main reason for the quiet sway of
religion over their country was the complete separation of church and state. I
have no hesitation in stating that throughout my stay in America I met nobody,
lay or cleric, who did not agree about that."

More recent history has only confirmed De Tocqueville's observations. If the
Court had struck down legislative prayer today, it would likely have stimulated
a furious reaction. But it would also, I am convinced, have invigorated both the
"spirit of religion" and the "spirit of freedom."
I respectfully dissent.
JUSTICE STEVENS, DISSENTING.
In a democratically elected legislature, the religious beliefs of the chaplain tend
to reflect the faith of the majority of the lawmakers' constituents. Prayers may
be said by a Catholic priest in the Massachusetts Legislature and by a
Presbyterian minister in the Nebraska Legislature, but I would not expect to
find a Jehovah's Witness or a disciple of Mary Baker Eddy or the Reverend
Moon serving as the official chaplain in any state legislature. Regardless of the
motivation of the majority that exercises the power to appoint the chaplain, 1 it
seems plain to me that the designation of a member of one religious faith to
serve as the sole official chaplain of a state legislature for a period of 16 years
constitutes the preference of one faith over another in violation of the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
The Court declines to "embark on a sensitive evaluation or to parse the content
of a particular prayer." Perhaps it does so because it would be unable to explain
away the clearly sectarian content of some of the prayers given by Nebraska's
chaplain. Or perhaps the Court is unwilling to acknowledge that the tenure of
the chaplain must inevitably be conditioned on the acceptability of that content
to the silent majority.
I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, EXCEPT AS TO PART II-B.
The Court must decide whether the town of Greece, New York, imposes an
impermissible establishment of religion by opening its monthly board meetings
with a prayer. It must be concluded, consistent with the Court's opinion in
Marsh v. Chambers (1983), that no violation of the Constitution has been shown.

I
Greece, a town with a population of 94,000, is in upstate New York. For some
years, it began its monthly town board meetings with a moment of silence. In
1999, the newly elected town supervisor, John Auberger, decided to replicate
the prayer practice he had found meaningful while serving in the county
legislature. Following the roll call and recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance,
Auberger would invite a local clergyman to the front of the room to deliver an
invocation. After the prayer, Auberger would thank the minister for serving as
the board's "chaplain for the month" and present him with a commemorative
plaque. The prayer was intended to place town board members in a solemn and
deliberative frame of mind, invoke divine guidance in town affairs, and follow a
tradition practiced by Congress and dozens of state legislatures.
The town followed an informal method for selecting prayer givers, all of whom
were unpaid volunteers. A town employee would call the congregations listed in
a local directory until she found a minister available for that month's meeting.
The town eventually compiled a list of willing "board chaplains" who had
accepted invitations and agreed to return in the future. The town at no point
excluded or denied an opportunity to a would-be prayer giver. Its leaders
maintained that a minister or layperson of any persuasion, including an atheist,
could give the invocation. But nearly all of the congregations in town were
Christian; and from 1999 to 2007, all of the participating ministers were too.
Greece neither reviewed the prayers in advance of the meetings nor provided
guidance as to their tone or content, in the belief that exercising any degree of
control over the prayers would infringe both the free exercise and speech rights
of the ministers. The town instead left the guest clergy free to compose their
own devotions. The resulting prayers often sounded both civic and religious
themes. Typical were invocations that asked the divinity to abide at the meeting
and bestow blessings on the community:
"Lord we ask you to send your spirit of servanthood upon all of us gathered here
this evening to do your work for the benefit of all in our community. We ask you
to bless our elected and appointed officials so they may deliberate with wisdom
and act with courage. Bless the members of our community who come here to
speak before the board so they may state their cause with honesty and
humility.... Lord we ask you to bless us all, that everything we do here tonight
will move you to welcome us one day into your kingdom as good and faithful
servants. We ask this in the name of our brother Jesus. Amen."

Some of the ministers spoke in a distinctly Christian idiom; and a minority
invoked religious holidays, scripture, or doctrine, as in the following prayer:
"Lord, God of all creation, we give you thanks and praise for your presence and
action in the world. We look with anticipation to the celebration of Holy Week
and Easter. It is in the solemn events of next week that we find the very heart
and center of our Christian faith. We acknowledge the saving sacrifice of Jesus
Christ on the cross. We draw strength, vitality, and confidence from his
resurrection at Easter.... We pray for peace in the world, an end to terrorism,
violence, conflict, and war. We pray for stability, democracy, and good
government in those countries in which our armed forces are now serving,
especially in Iraq and Afghanistan.... Praise and glory be yours, O Lord, now and
forever more. Amen."

The First Amendment

Respondents Susan Galloway and Linda Stephens attended town board
meetings to speak about issues of local concern, and they objected that the
prayers violated their religious or philosophical views. At one meeting, Galloway
admonished board members that she found the prayers "offensive,"
"intolerable," and an affront to a "diverse community." After respondents
complained that Christian themes pervaded the prayers, to the exclusion of
citizens who did not share those beliefs, the town invited a Jewish layman and
the chairman of the local Baha'i temple to deliver prayers. A Wiccan priestess
who had read press reports about the prayer controversy requested, and was
granted, an opportunity to give the invocation.
Galloway and Stephens brought suit in the United States District Court for the
Western District of New York. They alleged that the town violated the First
Amendment's Establishment Clause by preferring Christians over other prayer
givers and by sponsoring sectarian prayers, such as those given "in Jesus'
name." They did not seek an end to the prayer practice, but rather requested an
injunction that would limit the town to "inclusive and ecumenical" prayers that
referred only to a "generic God" and would not associate the government with
any one faith or belief.
The District Court on summary judgment upheld the prayer practice as
consistent with the First Amendment. It found no impermissible preference for
Christianity, noting that the town had opened the prayer program to all creeds
and excluded none. Although most of the prayer givers were Christian, this fact
reflected only the predominantly Christian identity of the town's congregations,
rather than an official policy or practice of discriminating against minority
faiths. The District Court found no authority for the proposition that the First
Amendment required Greece to invite clergy from congregations beyond its
borders in order to achieve a minimum level of religious diversity.
The District Court also rejected the theory that legislative prayer must be
nonsectarian. The court began its inquiry with the opinion in Marsh v.
Chambers ***
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. It held that some aspects
of the prayer program, viewed in their totality by a reasonable observer,
conveyed the message that Greece was endorsing Christianity. The town's
failure to promote the prayer opportunity to the public, or to invite ministers
from congregations outside the town limits, all but "ensured a Christian
viewpoint." Although the court found no inherent problem in the sectarian
content of the prayers, it concluded that the "steady drumbeat" of Christian
prayer, unbroken by invocations from other faith traditions, tended to affiliate
the town with Christianity. Finally, the court found it relevant that guest clergy
sometimes spoke on behalf of all present at the meeting, as by saying "let us
pray," or by asking audience members to stand and bow their heads: "The
invitation ... to participate in the prayer ... placed audience members who are
nonreligious or adherents of non-Christian religion in the awkward position of
either participating in prayers invoking beliefs they did not share or appearing
to show disrespect for the invocation." That board members bowed their heads
or made the sign of the cross further conveyed the message that the town
endorsed Christianity. The Court of Appeals emphasized that it was the
"interaction of the facts present in this case," rather than any single element,

Robson

1004

The First Amendment

that rendered the prayer unconstitutional.
Having granted certiorari to decide whether the town's prayer practice violates
the Establishment Clause, the Court now reverses the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.
II
In Marsh v. Chambers, the Court found no First Amendment violation in the
Nebraska Legislature's practice of opening its sessions with a prayer delivered
by a chaplain paid from state funds. ***
Marsh is sometimes described as "carving out an exception" to the Court's
Establishment Clause jurisprudence, because it sustained legislative prayer
without subjecting the practice to "any of the formal 'tests' that have
traditionally structured" this inquiry. The Court in Marsh found those tests
unnecessary because history supported the conclusion that legislative
invocations are compatible with the Establishment Clause. ***
Yet Marsh must not be understood as permitting a practice that would amount
to a constitutional violation if not for its historical foundation. The case teaches
instead that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted "by reference to
historical practices and understandings." *** Marsh stands for the proposition
that it is not necessary to define the precise boundary of the Establishment
Clause where history shows that the specific practice is permitted. Any test the
Court adopts must acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the Framers
and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change. A test that
would sweep away what has so long been settled would create new controversy
and begin anew the very divisions along religious lines that the Establishment
Clause seeks to prevent.
The Court's inquiry, then, must be to determine whether the prayer practice in
the town of Greece fits within the tradition long followed in Congress and the
state legislatures. Respondents assert that the town's prayer exercise falls
outside that tradition and transgresses the Establishment Clause for two
independent but mutually reinforcing reasons. First, they argue that Marsh did
not approve prayers containing sectarian language or themes, such as the
prayers offered in Greece that referred to the "death, resurrection, and
ascension of the Savior Jesus Christ," and the "saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ
on the cross." Second, they argue that the setting and conduct of the town
board meetings create social pressures that force nonadherents to remain in
the room or even feign participation in order to avoid offending the
representatives who sponsor the prayer and will vote on matters citizens bring
before the board. The sectarian content of the prayers compounds the subtle
coercive pressures, they argue, because the nonbeliever who might tolerate
ecumenical prayer is forced to do the same for prayer that might be inimical to
his or her beliefs.
A
***An insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single, fixed
standard is not consistent with the tradition of legislative prayer outlined in the
Court's cases. ***
To hold that invocations must be nonsectarian would force the legislatures that

Robson

1005

The First Amendment

sponsor prayers and the courts that are asked to decide these cases to act as
supervisors and censors of religious speech, a rule that would involve
government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the case under
the town's current practice of neither editing or approving prayers in advance
nor criticizing their content after the fact. ***
In rejecting the suggestion that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian, the
Court does not imply that no constraints remain on its content. The relevant
constraint derives from its place at the opening of legislative sessions, where it
is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values long part of the
Nation's heritage. Prayer that is solemn and respectful in tone, that invites
lawmakers to reflect upon shared ideals and common ends before they embark
on the fractious business of governing, serves that legitimate function. If the
course and practice over time shows that the invocations denigrate nonbelievers
or religious minorities, threaten damnation, or preach conversion, many
present may consider the prayer to fall short of the desire to elevate the purpose
of the occasion and to unite lawmakers in their common effort. That
circumstance would present a different case than the one presently before the
Court.
*** The prayers delivered in the town of Greece do not fall outside the tradition
this Court has recognized. A number of the prayers did invoke the name of
Jesus, the Heavenly Father, or the Holy Spirit, but they also invoked universal
themes, as by celebrating the changing of the seasons or calling for a "spirit of
cooperation" among town leaders. Among numerous examples of such prayer in
the record is the invocation given by the Rev. Richard Barbour at the September
2006 board meeting:
"Gracious God, you have richly blessed our nation and this community. Help us
to remember your generosity and give thanks for your goodness. Bless the
elected leaders of the Greece Town Board as they conduct the business of our
town this evening. Give them wisdom, courage, discernment and a singleminded desire to serve the common good. We ask your blessing on all public
servants, and especially on our police force, firefighters, and emergency medical
personnel.... Respectful of every religious tradition, I offer this prayer in the
name of God's only son Jesus Christ, the Lord, Amen."

Respondents point to other invocations that disparaged those who did not
accept the town's prayer practice. One guest minister characterized objectors as
a "minority" who are "ignorant of the history of our country," while another
lamented that other towns did not have "God-fearing" leaders. Although these
two remarks strayed from the rationale set out in Marsh, they do not despoil a
practice that on the whole reflects and embraces our tradition. Absent a pattern
of prayers that over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible
government purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a prayer will
not likely establish a constitutional violation. Marsh, indeed, requires an inquiry
into the prayer opportunity as a whole, rather than into the contents of a single
prayer.
*** The town made reasonable efforts to identify all of the congregations located
within its borders and represented that it would welcome a prayer by any
minister or layman who wished to give one. That nearly all of the congregations
in town turned out to be Christian does not reflect an aversion or bias on the

Robson

1006

The First Amendment

part of town leaders against minority faiths. So long as the town maintains a
policy of nondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search
beyond its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to achieve
religious balancing. ***
B
[plurality]
Respondents further seek to distinguish the town's prayer practice from the
tradition upheld in Marsh on the ground that it coerces participation by
nonadherents. They and some amici contend that prayer conducted in the
intimate setting of a town board meeting differs in fundamental ways from the
invocations delivered in Congress and state legislatures, where the public
remains segregated from legislative activity and may not address the body
except by occasional invitation. Citizens attend town meetings, on the other
hand, to accept awards; speak on matters of local importance; and petition the
board for action that may affect their economic interests, such as the granting
of permits, business licenses, and zoning variances. Respondents argue that
the public may feel subtle pressure to participate in prayers that violate their
beliefs in order to please the board members from whom they are about to seek
a favorable ruling. In their view the fact that board members in small towns
know many of their constituents by name only increases the pressure to
conform.
It is an elemental First Amendment principle that government may not coerce
its citizens "to support or participate in any religion or its exercise." On the
record in this case the Court is not persuaded that the town of Greece, through
the act of offering a brief, solemn, and respectful prayer to open its monthly
meetings, compelled its citizens to engage in a religious observance. The inquiry
remains a fact-sensitive one that considers both the setting in which the prayer
arises and the audience to whom it is directed.
The prayer opportunity in this case must be evaluated against the backdrop of
historical practice. ***
To be sure, many members of the public find these prayers meaningful and
wish to join them. But their purpose is largely to accommodate the spiritual
needs of lawmakers and connect them to a tradition dating to the time of the
Framers. For members of town boards and commissions, who often serve parttime and as volunteers, ceremonial prayer may also reflect the values they hold
as private citizens. The prayer is an opportunity for them to show who and what
they are without denying the right to dissent by those who disagree.
The analysis would be different if town board members directed the public to
participate in the prayers, singled out dissidents for opprobrium, or indicated
that their decisions might be influenced by a person's acquiescence in the
prayer opportunity. No such thing occurred in the town of Greece. Although
board members themselves stood, bowed their heads, or made the sign of the
cross during the prayer, they at no point solicited similar gestures by the public.
Respondents point to several occasions where audience members were asked to
rise for the prayer. These requests, however, came not from town leaders but
from the guest ministers, who presumably are accustomed to directing their
congregations in this way and might have done so thinking the action was

Robson

1007

The First Amendment

inclusive, not coercive. ("Would you bow your heads with me as we invite the
Lord's presence here tonight?"); ("Let us join our hearts and minds together in
prayer"); ("Would you join me in a moment of prayer?"); ("Those who are willing
may join me now in prayer"). Respondents suggest that constituents might feel
pressure to join the prayers to avoid irritating the officials who would be ruling
on their petitions, but this argument has no evidentiary support. Nothing in the
record indicates that town leaders allocated benefits and burdens based on
participation in the prayer, or that citizens were received differently depending
on whether they joined the invocation or quietly declined. In no instance did
town leaders signal disfavor toward nonparticipants or suggest that their
stature in the community was in any way diminished. A practice that classified
citizens based on their religious views would violate the Constitution, but that
is not the case before this Court.
In their declarations in the trial court, respondents stated that the prayers gave
them offense and made them feel excluded and disrespected. Offense, however,
does not equate to coercion. Adults often encounter speech they find
disagreeable; and an Establishment Clause violation is not made out any time a
person experiences a sense of affront from the expression of contrary religious
views in a legislative forum, especially where, as here, any member of the public
is welcome in turn to offer an invocation reflecting his or her own convictions. If
circumstances arise in which the pattern and practice of ceremonial, legislative
prayer is alleged to be a means to coerce or intimidate others, the objection can
be addressed in the regular course. But the showing has not been made here,
where the prayers neither chastised dissenters nor attempted lengthy
disquisition on religious dogma. Courts remain free to review the pattern of
prayers over time to determine whether they comport with the tradition of
solemn, respectful prayer approved in Marsh, or whether coercion is a real and
substantial likelihood. But in the general course legislative bodies do not
engage in impermissible coercion merely by exposing constituents to prayer
they would rather not hear and in which they need not participate.
This case can be distinguished from the conclusions and holding of Lee v.
Weisman. There the Court found that, in the context of a graduation where
school authorities maintained close supervision over the conduct of the
students and the substance of the ceremony, a religious invocation was coercive
as to an objecting student. Four Justices dissented in Lee, but the
circumstances the Court confronted there are not present in this case and do
not control its outcome. Nothing in the record suggests that members of the
public are dissuaded from leaving the meeting room during the prayer, arriving
late, or even, as happened here, making a later protest. In this case, as in
Marsh, board members and constituents are "free to enter and leave with little
comment and for any number of reasons." Should nonbelievers choose to exit
the room during a prayer they find distasteful, their absence will not stand out
as disrespectful or even noteworthy. And should they remain, their quiet
acquiescence will not, in light of our traditions, be interpreted as an agreement
with the words or ideas expressed. Neither choice represents an
unconstitutional imposition as to mature adults, who "presumably" are "not
readily susceptible to religious indoctrination or peer pressure."
In the town of Greece, the prayer is delivered during the ceremonial portion of

Robson

1008

The First Amendment

the town's meeting. Board members are not engaged in policymaking at this
time, but in more general functions, such as swearing in new police officers,
inducting high school athletes into the town hall of fame, and presenting
proclamations to volunteers, civic groups, and senior citizens. It is a moment
for town leaders to recognize the achievements of their constituents and the
aspects of community life that are worth celebrating. By inviting ministers to
serve as chaplain for the month, and welcoming them to the front of the room
alongside civic leaders, the town is acknowledging the central place that religion,
and religious institutions, hold in the lives of those present. Indeed, some
congregations are not simply spiritual homes for town residents but also the
provider of social services for citizens regardless of their beliefs. The inclusion of
a brief, ceremonial prayer as part of a larger exercise in civic recognition
suggests that its purpose and effect are to acknowledge religious leaders and
the institutions they represent rather than to exclude or coerce nonbelievers.
Ceremonial prayer is but a recognition that, since this Nation was founded and
until the present day, many Americans deem that their own existence must be
understood by precepts far beyond the authority of government to alter or
define and that willing participation in civic affairs can be consistent with a
brief acknowledgment of their belief in a higher power, always with due respect
for those who adhere to other beliefs. The prayer in this case has a permissible
ceremonial purpose. It is not an unconstitutional establishment of religion.
The town of Greece does not violate the First Amendment by opening its
meetings with prayer that comports with our tradition and does not coerce
participation by nonadherents. The judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit is reversed.
It is so ordered.

For centuries now, people have come to this country from every corner of the
world to share in the blessing of religious freedom. Our Constitution promises
that they may worship in their own way, without fear of penalty or danger, and

Robson

1009

The First Amendment

that in itself is a momentous offering. Yet our Constitution makes a
commitment still more remarkable--that however those individuals worship,
they will count as full and equal American citizens. A Christian, a Jew, a
Muslim (and so forth)--each stands in the same relationship with her country,
with her state and local communities, and with every level and body of
government. So that when each person performs the duties or seeks the
benefits of citizenship, she does so not as an adherent to one or another religion,
but simply as an American.
I respectfully dissent from the Court's opinion because I think the Town of
Greece's prayer practices violate that norm of religious equality--the
breathtakingly generous constitutional idea that our public institutions belong
no less to the Buddhist or Hindu than to the Methodist or Episcopalian. I do
not contend that principle translates here into a bright separationist line. To
the contrary, I agree with the Court's decision in Marsh v. Chambers (1983),
upholding the Nebraska Legislature's tradition of beginning each session with a
chaplain's prayer. And I believe that pluralism and inclusion in a town hall can
satisfy the constitutional requirement of neutrality; such a forum need not
become a religion-free zone. But still, the Town of Greece should lose this case.
The practice at issue here differs from the one sustained in Marsh because
Greece's town meetings involve participation by ordinary citizens, and the
invocations given--directly to those citizens--were predominantly sectarian in
content. Still more, Greece's Board did nothing to recognize religious diversity:
In arranging for clergy members to open each meeting, the Town never sought
(except briefly when this suit was filed) to involve, accommodate, or in any way
reach out to adherents of non-Christian religions. So month in and month out
for over a decade, prayers steeped in only one faith, addressed toward members
of the public, commenced meetings to discuss local affairs and distribute
government benefits. In my view, that practice does not square with the First
Amendment's promise that every citizen, irrespective of her religion, owns an
equal share in her government.
I
To begin to see what has gone wrong in the Town of Greece, consider several
hypothetical scenarios in which sectarian prayer--taken straight from this
case's record--infuses governmental activities. None involves, as this case does,
a proceeding that could be characterized as a legislative session, but they are
useful to elaborate some general principles. In each instance, assume (as was
true in Greece) that the invocation is given pursuant to government policy and
is representative of the prayers generally offered in the designated setting:
You are a party in a case going to trial; let's say you have filed suit against the
government for violating one of your legal rights. The judge bangs his gavel to
call the court to order, asks a minister to come to the front of the room, and
instructs the 10 or so individuals present to rise for an opening prayer. The
clergyman faces those in attendance and says: "Lord, God of all creation, .... We
acknowledge the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. We draw
strength ... from his resurrection at Easter. Jesus Christ, who took away the
sins of the world, destroyed our death, through his dying and in his rising, he
has restored our life. Blessed are you, who has raised up the Lord Jesus, you
who will raise us, in our turn, and put us by His side.... Amen." The judge then

Robson

1010

The First Amendment

asks your lawyer to begin the trial.
It's election day, and you head over to your local polling place to vote. As you
and others wait to give your names and receive your ballots, an election official
asks everyone there to join him in prayer. He says: "We pray this [day] for the
guidance of the Holy Spirit as [we vote] .... Let's just say the Our Father
together. 'Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy Kingdom
come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven....'" And after he concludes,
he makes the sign of the cross, and appears to wait expectantly for you and the
other prospective voters to do so too.
You are an immigrant attending a naturalization ceremony to finally become a
citizen. The presiding official tells you and your fellow applicants that before
administering the oath of allegiance, he would like a minister to pray for you
and with you. The pastor steps to the front of the room, asks everyone to bow
their heads, and recites: "[F]ather, son, and Holy Spirit--it is with a due sense of
reverence and awe that we come before you [today] seeking your blessing ....
You are ... a wise God, oh Lord, ... as evidenced even in the plan of redemption
that is fulfilled in Jesus Christ. We ask that you would give freely and
abundantly wisdom to one and to all... in the name of the Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ, who lives with you and the Holy Spirit, one God for ever and ever.
Amen."
I would hold that the government officials responsible for the above practices-that is, for prayer repeatedly invoking a single religion's beliefs in these
settings--crossed a constitutional line. I have every confidence the Court would
agree. And even Greece's attorney conceded that something like the first
hypothetical (he was not asked about the others) would violate the First
Amendment. Why?
The reason, of course, has nothing to do with Christianity as such. This opinion
is full of Christian prayers, because those were the only invocations offered in
the Town of Greece. But if my hypotheticals involved the prayer of some other
religion, the outcome would be exactly the same. Suppose, for example, that
government officials in a predominantly Jewish community asked a rabbi to
begin all public functions with a chanting of the Sh'ma and V'ahavta. ("Hear O
Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is One.... Bind [these words] as a sign upon
your hand; let them be a symbol before your eyes; inscribe them on the
doorposts of your house, and on your gates.") Or assume officials in a mostly
Muslim town requested a muezzin to commence such functions, over and over
again, with a recitation of the Adhan. ("God is greatest, God is greatest. I bear
witness that there is no deity but God. I bear witness that Muhammed is the
Messenger of God.") In any instance, the question would be why such
government-sponsored prayer of a single religion goes beyond the constitutional
pale.
One glaring problem is that the government in all these hypotheticals has
aligned itself with, and placed its imprimatur on, a particular religious creed.
"The clearest command of the Establishment Clause," this Court has held, "is
that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another."
Larson v. Valente (1982). ***
By authorizing and overseeing prayers associated with a single religion--to the

Robson

1011

The First Amendment

exclusion of all others--the government officials in my hypothetical cases
(whether federal, state, or local does not matter) have violated that foundational
principle. They have embarked on a course of religious favoritism anathema to
the First Amendment.
And making matters still worse: They have done so in a place where individuals
come to interact with, and participate in, the institutions and processes of their
government. A person goes to court, to the polls, to a naturalization ceremony-and a government official or his hand-picked minister asks her, as the first
order of official business, to stand and pray with others in a way conflicting
with her own religious beliefs. Perhaps she feels sufficient pressure to go along-to rise, bow her head, and join in whatever others are saying: After all, she
wants, very badly, what the judge or poll worker or immigration official has to
offer. Or perhaps she is made of stronger mettle, and she opts not to participate
in what she does not believe--indeed, what would, for her, be something like
blasphemy. She then must make known her dissent from the common religious
view, and place herself apart from other citizens, as well as from the officials
responsible for the invocations. And so a civic function of some kind brings
religious differences to the fore: That public proceeding becomes (whether
intentionally or not) an instrument for dividing her from adherents to the
community's majority religion, and for altering the very nature of her
relationship with her government.
That is not the country we are, because that is not what our Constitution
permits. Here, when a citizen stands before her government, whether to perform
a service or request a benefit, her religious beliefs do not enter into the picture.
See Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Act for Establishing Religious Freedom. The
government she faces favors no particular religion, either by word or by deed.
And that government, in its various processes and proceedings, imposes no
religious tests on its citizens, sorts none of them by faith, and permits no
exclusion based on belief. When a person goes to court, a polling place, or an
immigration proceeding--I could go on: to a zoning agency, a parole board
hearing, or the DMV--government officials do not engage in sectarian worship,
nor do they ask her to do likewise. They all participate in the business of
government not as Christians, Jews, Muslims (and more), but only as
Americans--none of them different from any other for that civic purpose. Why
not, then, at a town meeting?
II
In both Greece's and the majority's view, everything I have discussed is
irrelevant here because this case involves "the tradition of legislative prayer
outlined" in Marsh v. Chambers. And before I dispute the Town and Court, I
want to give them their due: They are right that, under Marsh, legislative prayer
has a distinctive constitutional warrant by virtue of tradition. *** And so I agree
with the majority that the issue here is "whether the prayer practice in the
Town of Greece fits within the tradition long followed in Congress and the state
legislatures."
Where I depart from the majority is in my reply to that question. The town hall
here is a kind of hybrid. Greece's Board indeed has legislative functions, as
Congress and state assemblies do--and that means some opening prayers are
allowed there. But much as in my hypotheticals, the Board's meetings are also

Robson

1012

The First Amendment

occasions for ordinary citizens to engage with and petition their government,
often on highly individualized matters. That feature calls for Board members to
exercise special care to ensure that the prayers offered are inclusive--that they
respect each and every member of the community as an equal citizen. But the
Board, and the clergy members it selected, made no such effort. Instead, the
prayers given in Greece, addressed directly to the Town's citizenry, were more
sectarian, and less inclusive, than anything this Court sustained in Marsh. For
those reasons, the prayer in Greece departs from the legislative tradition that
the majority takes as its benchmark.
A
Start by comparing two pictures, drawn precisely from reality. The first is of
Nebraska's (unicameral) Legislature, as this Court and the state senators
themselves described it. The second is of town council meetings in Greece, as
revealed in this case's record.
It is morning in Nebraska, and senators are beginning to gather in the State's
legislative chamber: It is the beginning of the official workday, although
senators may not yet need to be on the floor. The chaplain rises to give the daily
invocation. That prayer, as the senators emphasized when their case came to
this Court, is "directed only at the legislative membership, not at the public at
large." Any members of the public who happen to be in attendance--not very
many at this early hour--watch only from the upstairs visitors' gallery.
The longtime chaplain says something like the following (the excerpt is from his
own amicus brief supporting Greece in this case): "O God, who has given all
persons talents and varying capacities, Thou dost only require of us that we
utilize Thy gifts to a maximum. In this Legislature to which Thou has entrusted
special abilities and opportunities, may each recognize his stewardship for the
people of the State." The chaplain is a Presbyterian minister, and "some of his
earlier prayers" explicitly invoked Christian beliefs, but he "removed all
references to Christ" after a single legislator complained. The chaplain also
previously invited other clergy members to give the invocation, including local
rabbis.
Now change the channel: It is evening in Greece, New York, and the Supervisor
of the Town Board calls its monthly public meeting to order. Those meetings (so
says the Board itself) are "the most important part of Town government." See
Town of Greece, Town Board [website]. They serve assorted functions, almost all
actively involving members of the public. The Board may swear in new Town
employees and hand out awards for civic accomplishments; it always provides
an opportunity (called a Public Forum) for citizens to address local issues and
ask for improved services or new policies (for example, better accommodations
for the disabled or actions to ameliorate traffic congestion; and it usually hears
debate on individual applications from residents and local businesses to obtain
special land-use permits, zoning variances, or other licenses.
The Town Supervisor, Town Clerk, Chief of Police, and four Board members sit
at the front of the meeting room on a raised dais. But the setting is intimate:
There are likely to be only 10 or so citizens in attendance. A few may be
children or teenagers, present to receive an award or fulfill a high school civics
requirement.

The First Amendment

As the first order of business, the Town Supervisor introduces a local Christian
clergy member--denominated the chaplain of the month--to lead the assembled
persons in prayer. The pastor steps up to a lectern (emblazoned with the Town's
seal) at the front of the dais, and with his back to the Town officials, he faces
the citizens present. He asks them all to stand and to "pray as we begin this
evening's town meeting." (He does not suggest that anyone should feel free not
to participate.) And he says:
"The beauties of spring ... are an expressive symbol of the new life of the risen
Christ. The Holy Spirit was sent to the apostles at Pentecost so that they would
be courageous witnesses of the Good News to different regions of the
Mediterranean world and beyond. The Holy Spirit continues to be the inspiration
and the source of strength and virtue, which we all need in the world of today.
And so ... [w]e pray this evening for the guidance of the Holy Spirit as the Greece
Town Board meets."

After the pastor concludes, Town officials behind him make the sign of the cross,
as do some members of the audience, and everyone says "Amen." The
Supervisor then announces the start of the Public Forum, and a citizen stands
up to complain about the Town's contract with a cable company.
B
Let's count the ways in which these pictures diverge. ***
C
Those three differences, taken together, remove this case from the protective
ambit of Marsh and the history on which it relied. To recap: Marsh upheld
prayer addressed to legislators alone, in a proceeding in which citizens had no
role--and even then, only when it did not "proselytize or advance" any single
religion. It was that legislative prayer practice (not every prayer in a body
exercising any legislative function) that the Court found constitutional given its
"unambiguous and unbroken history." But that approved practice, as I have
shown, is not Greece's. None of the history Marsh cited--and none the majority
details today--supports calling on citizens to pray, in a manner consonant with
only a single religion's beliefs, at a participatory public proceeding, having both
legislative and adjudicative components. Or to use the majority's phrase, no
"history shows that th[is] specific practice is permitted." And so, contra the
majority, Greece's prayers cannot simply ride on the constitutional coattails of
the legislative tradition Marsh described. The Board's practice must, in its own
particulars, meet constitutional requirements.
And the guideposts for addressing that inquiry include the principles of
religious neutrality I discussed earlier. The government (whether federal, state,
or local) may not favor, or align itself with, any particular creed. And that is
nowhere more true than when officials and citizens come face to face in their
shared institutions of governance. In performing civic functions and seeking
civic benefits, each person of this nation must experience a government that
belongs to one and all, irrespective of belief. And for its part, each government
must ensure that its participatory processes will not classify those citizens by
faith, or make relevant their religious differences.
*** None of this means that Greece's town hall must be religion- or prayer-free.
"[W]e are a religious people," Marsh observed [quoting] and prayer draws some

Robson

1014

The First Amendment

warrant from tradition in a town hall, as well as in Congress or a state
legislature. What the circumstances here demand is the recognition that we are
a pluralistic people too. When citizens of all faiths come to speak to each other
and their elected representatives in a legislative session, the government must
take especial care to ensure that the prayers they hear will seek to include,
rather than serve to divide. No more is required--but that much is crucial--to
treat every citizen, of whatever religion, as an equal participant in
her government.
*** But Greece could not do what it did: infuse a participatory government body
with one (and only one) faith, so that month in and month out, the citizens
appearing before it become partly defined by their creed--as those who share,
and those who do not, the community's majority religious belief. In this country,
when citizens go before the government, they go not as Christians or Muslims
or Jews (or what have you), but just as Americans (or here, as Grecians). That
is what it means to be an equal citizen, irrespective of religion. And that is what
the Town of Greece precluded by so identifying itself with a single faith.
III
How, then, does the majority go so far astray, allowing the Town of Greece to
turn its assemblies for citizens into a forum for Christian prayer? The answer
does not lie in first principles: I have no doubt that every member of this Court
believes as firmly as I that our institutions of government belong equally to all,
regardless of faith. Rather, the error reflects two kinds of blindness. First, the
majority misapprehends the facts of this case, as distinct from those
characterizing traditional legislative prayer. And second, the majority misjudges
the essential meaning of the religious worship in Greece's town hall, along with
its capacity to exclude and divide. ***
IV
In 1790, George Washington traveled to Newport, Rhode Island, a longtime
bastion of religious liberty and the home of the first community of American
Jews. Among the citizens he met there was Moses Seixas, one of that
congregation's lay officials. The ensuing exchange between the two conveys, as
well as anything I know, the promise this country makes to members of every
religion.
Seixas wrote first, welcoming Washington to Newport. He spoke of "a deep sense
of gratitude" for the new American Government--"a Government, which to
bigotry gives no sanction, to persecution no assistance--but generously
affording to All liberty of conscience, and immunities of Citizenship: deeming
every one, of whatever Nation, tongue, or language, equal parts of the great
governmental Machine." The first phrase there is the more poetic: a government
that to "bigotry gives no sanction, to persecution no assistance." But the second
is actually the more startling and transformative: a government that, beyond
not aiding persecution, grants "immunities of citizenship" to the Christian and
the Jew alike, and makes them "equal parts" of the whole country.
Washington responded the very next day. Like any successful politician, he
appreciated a great line when he saw one--and knew to borrow it too. And so he
repeated, word for word, Seixas's phrase about neither sanctioning bigotry nor
assisting persecution. But he no less embraced the point Seixas had made
about equality of citizenship. "It is now no more," Washington said, "that

Robson

1015

The First Amendment

toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people" to
another, lesser one. For "[a]ll possess alike . . . immunities of citizenship." That
is America's promise in the First Amendment: full and equal membership in the
polity for members of every religious group, assuming only that they, like
anyone "who live[s] under [the Government's] protection[,] should demean
themselves as good citizens."
For me, that remarkable guarantee means at least this much: When the citizens
of this country approach their government, they do so only as Americans, not
as members of one faith or another. And that means that even in a partly
legislative body, they should not confront government-sponsored worship that
divides them along religious lines. I believe, for all the reasons I have given, that
the Town of Greece betrayed that promise. I therefore respectfully dissent from
the Court's decision.

Notes	  
1.
The Second Circuit had held that the prayer practices of Town of
Greece violated the Establishment Clause, reasoning that one invocation
to Athena out of 130 is simply not sufficient to meet the requirement of
non-endorsement given that two-thirds of the prayers contained
references to “Jesus Christ,” “Jesus,” “Your Son,” or the “Holy Spirit.”
The Brief for the United States (and thus the Obama Administration)
supported the Town of Greece, arguing that the courts should not
consider the content of the prayers:
Under the principles announced in Marsh, which relied heavily on the history of
legislative prayer in this country, a prayer practice that is not problematic in the
ways identified in Marsh (as petitioner’s practice concededly is not) does not
amount to an unconstitutional establishment of religion merely because most
prayer- givers are Christian and many or most of their prayers contain sectarian
references. The unbroken history of the offering of prayer in Congress, for
example, has included a large majority of Christian prayer-givers and a
substantial number of prayers with identifiably sectarian references. Neither
federal courts nor legislative bodies are well suited to police the content of such
prayers, and this Court has consistently disapproved of government interference
in dictating the substance of prayers.

Do you think the same view would prevail if the prayers were not JudeoChristian?
2.

What about prayers in court? Consider this:
It was in 1982 that Bates was indicted in Bay County, Florida, for the firstdegree murder, kidnapping, sexual battery, and armed robbery of Janet Renee
White. Before the beginning of jury selection for the 1983 trial, the judge asked
those present in the courtroom, including the members of the jury venire, to
stand while Reverend N.B. Langford of the First Baptist Church opened the
proceedings with a prayer. Reverend Langford then gave the following
invocation:
May we pray together. Father, this is a beautiful day that you've given to
each of us, and we thank you for the privilege that's ours to enjoy all the

Robson

1016

The First Amendment

bounties that you've given to each of us. Lord, we pray for the
seriousness of the situation with which we're confronted, and we ask for
your wisdom and your guidance, Father, upon all who are involved, we
pray for the Judge as he presides for your special wisdom and for your
guidance to do upon his life. Thank you, Father, that we live in a country
that has freedom for all, and we ask now for your leadership and your
blessings upon the judicial system, for in Christ's name I pray, Amen.
Bates' court-appointed counsel, Theodore Bowers, did not object to the prayer
and the court proceeded with jury selection. The next day the prosecution called
its first witness, the victim's husband. He testified, among other things, that he
had last seen his wife at the First Baptist Church as her coffin was being closed
during her funeral service. Bowers did not object to that testimony.

Bates was convicted and sentenced to death. In a habeas petition, he
argued ineffective assistance by his attorney for not objecting to the
prayer and the subsequent testimony. What result? See Bates v. Sec'y,
Florida Dep't of Corr., 768 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir. 2014).

This litigation concerns the constitutionality of two recurring holiday displays
located on public property in downtown Pittsburgh. The first is a crèche placed
on the Grand Staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse. The second is a
Chanukah menorah placed just outside the City-County Building, next to a
Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty. The Court of Appeals for the Third
Robson

1017

The First Amendment

Circuit ruled that each display violates the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment because each has the impermissible effect of endorsing religion. We
agree that the crèche display has that unconstitutional effect but reverse the
Court of Appeals' judgment regarding the menorah display.
I
A
The county courthouse is owned by Allegheny County and is its seat of
government. It houses the offices of the county commissioners, controller,
treasurer, sheriff, and clerk of court. Civil and criminal trials are held there.
The "main," "most beautiful," and "most public" part of the courthouse is its
Grand Staircase, set into one arch and surrounded by others, with arched
windows serving as a backdrop.
Since 1981, the county has permitted the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic
group, to display a crèche in the county courthouse during the Christmas
holiday season. Christmas, we note perhaps needlessly, is the holiday when
Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, whom they believe to be the
Messiah. Western churches have celebrated Christmas Day on December 25
since the fourth century. As observed in this Nation, Christmas has a secular,
as well as a religious, dimension.
The crèche in the county courthouse, like other crèches, is a visual
representation of the scene in the manager in Bethlehem shortly after the birth
of Jesus, as described in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew. The crèche includes
figures of the infant Jesus, Mary, Joseph, farm animals, shepherds, and wise
men, all placed in or before a wooden representation of a manager, which has at
its crest an angel bearing a banner that proclaims "Gloria in Excelsis Deo!"
During the 1986-1987 holiday season, the crèche was on display on the Grand
Staircase from November 26 to January 9. It had a wooden fence on three sides
and bore a plaque stating: "This Display Donated by the Holy Name Society."
Sometime during the week of December 2, the county placed red and white
poinsettia plants around the fence. The county also placed a small evergreen
tree, decorated with a red bow, behind each of the two end-posts of the fence.
These trees stood alongside the manger backdrop and were slightly shorter than
it was. The angel thus was at the apex of the crèche display. Altogether, the
crèche, the fence, the poinsettias, and the trees occupied a substantial amount
of space on the Grand Staircase. No figures of Santa Claus or other decorations
appeared on the Grand Staircase. Cf. Lynch v. Donnelly (1984).
The county uses the crèche as the setting for its annual Christmas-carol
program. During the 1986 season, the county invited high school choirs and
other musical groups to perform during weekday lunch hours from December 3
through December 23. The county dedicated this program to world peace and to
the families of prisoners-of-war and of persons missing in action in Southeast
Asia.
Near the Grand Staircase is an area of the county courthouse known as the
"gallery forum" used for art and other cultural exhibits. The crèche, with its
fence-and-floral frame, however, was distinct and not connected with any
exhibit in the gallery forum. In addition, various departments and offices within

Robson

1018

The First Amendment

the county courthouse had their own Christmas decorations, but these also are
not visible from the Grand Staircase.
B
The City-County Building is separate and a block removed from the county
courthouse and, as the name implies, is jointly owned by the city of Pittsburgh
and Allegheny County. The city's portion of the building houses the city's
principal offices, including the mayor's. The city is responsible for the building's
Grant Street entrance which has three rounded arches supported by columns.
For a number of years, the city has had a large Christmas tree under the
middle arch outside the Grant Street entrance. Following this practice, city
employees on November 17, 1986, erected a 45-foot tree under the middle arch
and decorated it with lights and ornaments. A few days later, the city placed at
the foot of the tree a sign bearing the mayor's name and entitled "Salute to
Liberty." Beneath the title, the sign stated:
"During this holiday season, the city of Pittsburgh salutes liberty. Let these
festive lights remind us that we are the keepers of the flame of liberty and our
legacy of freedom."

At least since 1982, the city has expanded its Grant Street holiday display to
include a symbolic representation of Chanukah, an 8-day Jewish holiday that
begins on the 25th day of the Jewish lunar month of Kislev. The 25th of Kislev
usually occurs in December, 9 and thus Chanukah is the annual Jewish
holiday that falls closest to Christmas Day each year. In 1986, Chanukah began
at sundown on December 26.
According to Jewish tradition, on the 25th of Kislev in 164 B.C.E. (before the
common era (165 B.C.)), the Maccabees rededicated the Temple of Jerusalem
after recapturing it from the Greeks, or, more accurately, from the Greekinfluenced Seleucid Empire, in the course of a political rebellion. Chanukah is
the holiday which celebrates that event. The early history of the celebration of
Chanukah is unclear; it appears that the holiday's central ritual - the lighting of
lamps - was well established long before a single explanation of that ritual took
hold.
The Talmud explains the lamplighting ritual as a commemoration of an event
that occurred during the rededication of the Temple. The Temple housed a
seven-branch menorah, which was to be kept burning continuously. When the
Maccabees rededicated the Temple, they had only enough oil to last for one day.
But, according to the Talmud, the oil miraculously lasted for eight days (the
length of time it took to obtain additional oil). To celebrate and publicly
proclaim this miracle, the Talmud prescribes that it is a mitzvah (i. e., a
religious deed or commandment), for Jews to place a lamp with eight lights just
outside the entrance to their homes or in a front window during the eight days
of Chanukah. Where practicality or safety from persecution so requires, the
lamp may be placed in a window or inside the home. The Talmud also ordains
certain blessings to be recited each night of Chanukah before lighting the lamp.
One such benediction has been translated into English as "We are blessing God
who has sanctified us and commanded us with mitzvot and has told us to light
the candles of Hanukkah."

Robson

1019

The First Amendment

Although Jewish law does not contain any rule regarding the shape or
substance of a Chanukah lamp (or "hanukkiyyah"), it became customary to
evoke the memory of the Temple menorah. The Temple menorah was of a treeand-branch design; it had a central candlestick with six branches. In contrast,
a Chanukah menorah of tree-and-branch design has eight branches - one for
each day of the holiday - plus a ninth to hold the shamash (an extra candle
used to light the other eight). Also in contrast to the Temple menorah, the
Chanukah menorah is not a sanctified object; it need not be treated with
special care.
Lighting the menorah is the primary tradition associated with Chanukah, but
the holiday is marked by other traditions as well. One custom among some
Jews is to give children Chanukah gelt, or money. Another is for the children to
gamble their gelt using a dreidel, a top with four sides. Each of the four sides
contains a Hebrew letter; together the four letters abbreviate a phrase that
refers to the Chanukah miracle.
Chanukah, like Christmas, is a cultural event as well as a religious holiday.
Indeed, the Chanukah story always has had a political or national, as well as a
religious, dimension: it tells of national heroism in addition to divine
intervention. Also, Chanukah, like Christmas, is a winter holiday; according to
some historians, it was associated in ancient times with the winter solstice.
Just as some Americans celebrate Christmas without regard to its religious
significance, some nonreligious American Jews celebrate Chanukah as an
expression of ethnic identity, and "as a cultural or national event, rather than
as a specifically religious event."
The cultural significance of Chanukah varies with the setting in which the
holiday is celebrated. In contemporary Israel, the nationalist and military
aspects of the Chanukah story receive special emphasis. In this country, the
tradition of giving Chanukah gelt has taken on greater importance because of
the temporal proximity of Chanukah to Christmas. Indeed, some have
suggested that the proximity of Christmas accounts for the social prominence of
Chanukah in this country. Whatever the reason, Chanukah is observed by
American Jews to an extent greater than its religious importance would
indicate: in the hierarchy of Jewish holidays, Chanukah ranks fairly low in
religious significance. This socially heightened status of Chanukah reflects its
cultural or secular dimension.
On December 22 of the 1986 holiday season, the city placed at the Grant Street
entrance to the City-County Building an 18-foot Chanukah menorah of an
abstract tree-and-branch design. The menorah was placed next to the city's 45foot Christmas tree, against one of the columns that supports the arch into
which the tree was set. The menorah is owned by Chabad, a Jewish group, but
is stored, erected, and removed each year by the city. The tree, the sign, and the
menorah were all removed on January 13. Appendix B, is a photograph of the
tree, the sign, and the menorah.
II
This litigation began on December 10, 1986, when respondents, the Greater
Pittsburgh Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and seven local

Robson

1020

The First Amendment

residents, filed suit against the county and the city, seeking permanently to
enjoin the county from displaying the crèche in the county courthouse and the
city from displaying the menorah in front of the City-County Building.
Respondents claim that the displays of the crèche and the menorah each violate
the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to state
governments by the Fourteenth Amendment. Chabad was permitted to
intervene to defend the display of its menorah.
On May 8, 1987, the District Court denied respondents' request for a
permanent injunction. Relying on Lynch v. Donnelly (1984), the court stated
that "the crèche was but part of the holiday decoration of the stairwell and a
foreground for the high school choirs which entertained each day at noon."
Regarding the menorah, the court concluded that "it was but an insignificant
part of another holiday display." The court also found that "the displays had a
secular purpose" and "did not create an excessive entanglement of government
with religion."
Respondents appealed, and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed.
Distinguishing Lynch v. Donnelly, the panel majority determined that the crèche
and the menorah must be understood as endorsing Christianity and Judaism.
*** The dissenting judge stated that the crèche, "accompanied by poinsettia
plants and evergreens, does not violate the Establishment Clause simply
because plastic Santa Clauses or reindeer are absent." As to the menorah, he
asserted: "Including a reference to Chanukah did no more than broaden the
commemoration of the holiday season and stress the notion of sharing its joy."
Rehearing en banc was denied by a 6-to-5 vote. The county, the city, and
Chabad each filed a petition for certiorari. We granted all three petitions.
III
A
This Nation is heir to a history and tradition of religious diversity that dates
from the settlement of the North American Continent. Sectarian differences
among various Christian denominations were central to the origins of our
Republic. Since then, adherents of religions too numerous to name have made
the United States their home, as have those whose beliefs expressly exclude
religion.
Precisely because of the religious diversity that is our national heritage, the
Founders added to the Constitution a Bill of Rights, the very first words of
which declare: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . ." Perhaps in the early days
of the Republic these words were understood to protect only the diversity within
Christianity, but today they are recognized as guaranteeing religious liberty and
equality to "the infidel, the atheist, or the adherent of a non-Christian faith
such as Islam or Judaism." It is settled law that no government official in this
Nation may violate these fundamental constitutional rights regarding matters of
conscience.
In the course of adjudicating specific cases, this Court has come to understand
the Establishment Clause to mean that government may not promote or affiliate
itself with any religious doctrine or organization, may not discriminate among
persons on the basis of their religious beliefs and practices, may not delegate a

Robson

1021

The First Amendment

governmental power to a religious institution, and may not involve itself too
deeply in such an institution's affairs. ***
In Lemon v. Kurtzman, the Court sought to refine these principles by focusing
on three "tests" for determining whether a government practice violates the
Establishment Clause. Under the Lemon analysis, a statute or practice which
touches upon religion, if it is to be permissible under the Establishment Clause,
must have a secular purpose; it must neither advance nor inhibit religion in its
principal or primary effect; and it must not foster an excessive entanglement
with religion. This trilogy of tests has been applied regularly in the Court's later
Establishment Clause cases.
Our subsequent decisions further have refined the definition of governmental
action that unconstitutionally advances religion. In recent years, we have paid
particularly close attention to whether the challenged governmental practice
either has the purpose or effect of "endorsing" religion, a concern that has long
had a place in our Establishment Clause jurisprudence. ***
Of course, the word "endorsement" is not self-defining. Rather, it derives its
meaning from other words that this Court has found useful over the years in
interpreting the Establishment Clause.
*** Whether the key word is
"endorsement," "favoritism," or "promotion," the essential principle remains the
same. The Establishment Clause, at the very least, prohibits government from
appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief or from "making
adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person's standing in the
political community." Lynch v. Donnelly (O'Connor, J., concurring).
B
We have had occasion in the past to apply Establishment Clause principles to
the government's display of objects with religious significance. In Stone v.
Graham (1980), we held that the display of a copy of the Ten Commandments
on the walls of public classrooms violates the Establishment Clause. Closer to
the facts of this litigation is Lynch v. Donnelly in which we considered whether
the city of Pawtucket, R. I., had violated the Establishment Clause by including
a crèche in its annual Christmas display, located in a private park within the
downtown shopping district. By a 5-to-4 decision in that difficult case, the
Court upheld inclusion of the crèche in the Pawtucket display, holding, inter
alia, that the inclusion of the crèche did not have the impermissible effect of
advancing or promoting religion.
The rationale of the majority opinion in Lynch is none too clear: the opinion
contains two strands, neither of which provides guidance for decision in
subsequent cases. First, the opinion states that the inclusion of the crèche in
the display was "no more an advancement or endorsement of religion" than
other "endorsements" this Court has approved in the past, - but the opinion
offers no discernible measure for distinguishing between permissible and
impermissible endorsements. Second, the opinion observes that any benefit the
government's display of the crèche gave to religion was no more than "indirect,
remote, and incidental," - without saying how or why.
Although Justice O'Connor joined the majority opinion in Lynch, she wrote a
concurrence that differs in significant respects from the majority opinion. The

Robson

1022

The First Amendment

main difference is that the concurrence provides a sound analytical framework
for evaluating governmental use of religious symbols.
First and foremost, the concurrence squarely rejects any notion that this Court
will tolerate some government endorsement of religion. Rather, the concurrence
recognizes any endorsement of religion as "invalid," because it "sends a message
to nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the political
community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders,
favored members of the political community.”
Second, the concurrence articulates a method for determining whether the
government's use of an object with religious meaning has the effect of endorsing
religion. The effect of the display depends upon the message that the
government's practice communicates: the question is "what viewers may fairly
understand to be the purpose of the display." ***
The concurrence applied this mode of analysis to the Pawtucket crèche, seen in
the context of that city's holiday celebration as a whole. In addition to the
crèche, the city's display contained: a Santa Claus house with a live Santa
distributing candy; reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh; a live 40-foot Christmas tree
strung with lights; statutes of carolers in old-fashioned dress; candy-striped
poles; a "talking" wishing well; a large banner proclaiming "SEASONS
GREETINGS"; a miniature "village" with several houses and a church; and
various "cut-out" figures, including those of a clown, a dancing elephant, a
robot, and a teddy bear. The concurrence concluded that both because the
crèche is "a traditional symbol" of Christmas, a holiday with strong secular
elements, and because the crèche was "displayed along with purely secular
symbols," the crèche’s setting "changes what viewers may fairly understand to
be the purpose of the display" and "negates any message of endorsement" of
"the Christian beliefs represented by the crèche."
*** Accordingly, our present task is to determine whether the display of the
crèche and the menorah, in their respective "particular physical settings," has
the effect of endorsing or disapproving religious beliefs.
IV
We turn first to the county's crèche display. There is no doubt, of course, that
the crèche itself is capable of communicating a religious message. Indeed, the
crèche in this lawsuit uses words, as well as the picture of the Nativity scene, to
make its religious meaning unmistakably clear. "Glory to God in the Highest!"
says the angel in the crèche - Glory to God because of the birth of Jesus. This
praise to God in Christian terms is indisputably religious - indeed sectarian just as it is when said in the Gospel or in a church service.
Under the Court's holding in Lynch, the effect of a crèche display turns on its
setting. Here, unlike in Lynch, nothing in the context of the display detracts
from the crèche’s religious message. The Lynch display comprised a series of
figures and objects, each group of which had its own focal point. Santa's house
and his reindeer were objects of attention separate from the crèche, and had
their specific visual story to tell. Similarly, whatever a "talking" wishing well
may be, it obviously was a center of attention separate from the crèche. Here, in
contrast, the crèche stands alone: it is the single element of the display on the
Grand Staircase.

equivalent to the secular symbols in the overall Lynch display. The floral frame,
like all good frames, serves only to draw one's attention to the message inside
the frame. The floral decoration surrounding the crèche contributes to, rather
than detracts from, the endorsement of religion conveyed by the crèche. It is as
if the county had allowed the Holy Name Society to display a cross on the
Grand Staircase at Easter, and the county had surrounded the cross with
Easter lilies. The county could not say that surrounding the cross with
traditional flowers of the season would negate the endorsement of Christianity
conveyed by the cross on the Grand Staircase. Its contention that the
traditional Christmas greens negate the endorsement effect of the crèche fares
no better.
Nor does the fact that the crèche was the setting for the county's annual
Christmas-carol program diminish its religious meaning. ***
Furthermore, the crèche sits on the Grand Staircase, the "main" and "most
beautiful part" of the building that is the seat of county government. ***
The fact that the crèche bears a sign disclosing its ownership by a Roman
Catholic organization does not alter this conclusion. On the contrary, the sign
simply demonstrates that the government is endorsing the religious message of
that organization, rather than communicating a message of its own. *** Indeed,
the very concept of "endorsement" conveys the sense of promoting someone
else's message. Thus, by prohibiting government endorsement of religion, the
Establishment Clause prohibits precisely what occurred here: the government's
lending its support to the communication of a religious organization's religious
message.
Finally, the county argues that it is sufficient to validate the display of the
crèche on the Grand Staircase that the display celebrates Christmas, and
Christmas is a national holiday. This argument obviously proves too much. It
would allow the celebration of the Eucharist inside a courthouse on Christmas
Eve. ***
In sum, Lynch teaches that government may celebrate Christmas in some
manner and form, but not in a way that endorses Christian doctrine. Here,
Allegheny County has transgressed this line. It has chosen to celebrate
Christmas in a way that has the effect of endorsing a patently Christian
message: Glory to God for the birth of Jesus Christ. Under Lynch, and the rest
of our cases, nothing more is required to demonstrate a violation of the
Establishment Clause. The display of the crèche in this context, therefore, must
be permanently enjoined.
V
Justice Kennedy and the three Justices who join him would find the display of
the crèche consistent with the Establishment Clause. He argues that this
conclusion necessarily follows from the Court's decision in Marsh v. Chambers
(1983), which sustained the constitutionality of legislative prayer. He also
asserts that the crèche, even in this setting, poses "no realistic risk" of
"represent[ing] an effort to proselytize," having repudiated the Court's
endorsement inquiry in favor of a "proselytization" approach. The Court's

Robson

analysis of the crèche, he contends, "reflects an unjustified hostility toward
religion."
Justice Kennedy's reasons for permitting the crèche on the Grand Staircase and
his condemnation of the Court's reasons for deciding otherwise are so far
reaching in their implications that they require a response in some depth. ***

Although Justice Kennedy repeatedly accuses the Court of harboring a "latent
hostility" or "callous indifference" toward religion, nothing could be further from
the truth, and the accusations could be said to be as offensive as they are
absurd. Justice Kennedy apparently has misperceived a respect for religious
pluralism, a respect commanded by the Constitution, as hostility or indifference
to religion. No misperception could be more antithetical to the values embodied
in the Establishment Clause. ***
VI
The display of the Chanukah menorah in front of the City-County Building may
well present a closer constitutional question. The menorah, one must recognize,
is a religious symbol: it serves to commemorate the miracle of the oil as
described in the Talmud. But the menorah's message is not exclusively religious.
The menorah is the primary visual symbol for a holiday that, like Christmas,
has both religious and secular dimensions.
Moreover, the menorah here stands next to a Christmas tree and a sign
saluting liberty. While no challenge has been made here to the display of the
tree and the sign, their presence is obviously relevant in determining the effect
of the menorah's display. The necessary result of placing a menorah next to a
Christmas tree is to create an "overall holiday setting" that represents both
Christmas and Chanukah - two holidays, not one.
The mere fact that Pittsburgh displays symbols of both Christmas and
Chanukah does not end the constitutional inquiry. If the city celebrates both
Christmas and Chanukah as religious holidays, then it violates the
Establishment Clause. The simultaneous endorsement of Judaism and
Christianity is no less constitutionally infirm than the endorsement of
Christianity alone.
Conversely, if the city celebrates both Christmas and Chanukah as secular
holidays, then its conduct is beyond the reach of the Establishment Clause.
Because government may celebrate Christmas as a secular holiday, it follows
that government may also acknowledge Chanukah as a secular holiday. Simply
put, it would be a form of discrimination against Jews to allow Pittsburgh to
celebrate Christmas as a cultural tradition while simultaneously disallowing the
city's acknowledgment of Chanukah as a contemporaneous cultural tradition.
Accordingly, the relevant question for Establishment Clause purposes is
whether the combined display of the tree, the sign, and the menorah has the
effect of endorsing both Christian and Jewish faiths, or rather simply recognizes

Robson

1025

The First Amendment

that both Christmas and Chanukah are part of the same winter-holiday season,
which has attained a secular status in our society. Of the two interpretations of
this particular display, the latter seems far more plausible and is also in line
with Lynch.
The Christmas tree, unlike the menorah, is not itself a religious symbol.
Although Christmas trees once carried religious connotations, today they typify
the secular celebration of Christmas. Numerous Americans place Christmas
trees in their homes without subscribing to Christian religious beliefs, and
when the city's tree stands alone in front of the City-County Building, it is not
considered an endorsement of Christian faith. Indeed, a 40-foot Christmas tree
was one of the objects that validated the crèche in Lynch. The widely accepted
view of the Christmas tree as the preeminent secular symbol of the Christmas
holiday season serves to emphasize the secular component of the message
communicated by other elements of an accompanying holiday display, including
the Chanukah menorah.
The tree, moreover, is clearly the predominant element in the city's display. The
45-foot tree occupies the central position beneath the middle archway in front
of the Grant Street entrance to the City-County Building; the 18-foot menorah
is positioned to one side. Given this configuration, it is much more sensible to
interpret the meaning of the menorah in light of the tree, rather than vice versa.
In the shadow of the tree, the menorah is readily understood as simply a
recognition that Christmas is not the only traditional way of observing the
winter-holiday season. In these circumstances, then, the combination of the
tree and the menorah communicates, not a simultaneous endorsement of both
the Christian and Jewish faiths, but instead, a secular celebration of Christmas
coupled with an acknowledgment of Chanukah as a contemporaneous
alternative tradition.
Although the city has used a symbol with religious meaning as its
representation of Chanukah, this is not a case in which the city has reasonable
alternatives that are less religious in nature. It is difficult to imagine a
predominantly secular symbol of Chanukah that the city could place next to its
Christmas tree. An 18-foot dreidel would look out of place and might be
interpreted by some as mocking the celebration of Chanukah. The absence of a
more secular alternative symbol is itself part of the context in which the city's
actions must be judged in determining the likely effect of its use of the menorah.
Where the government's secular message can be conveyed by two symbols, only
one of which carries religious meaning, an observer reasonably might infer from
the fact that the government has chosen to use the religious symbol that the
government means to promote religious faith. But where, as here, no such
choice has been made, this inference of endorsement is not present.
The mayor's sign further diminishes the possibility that the tree and the
menorah will be interpreted as a dual endorsement of Christianity and Judaism.
The sign states that during the holiday season the city salutes liberty. Moreover,
the sign draws upon the theme of light, common to both Chanukah and
Christmas as winter festivals, and links that theme with this Nation's legacy of
freedom, which allows an American to celebrate the holiday season in whatever
way he wishes, religiously or otherwise. ***

Robson

1026

The First Amendment

Given all these considerations, it is not "sufficiently likely" that residents of
Pittsburgh will perceive the combined display of the tree, the sign, and the
menorah as an "endorsement" or "disapproval . . . of their individual religious
choices." While an adjudication of the display's effect must take into account
the perspective of one who is neither Christian nor Jewish, as well as of those
who adhere to either of these religions, the constitutionality of its effect must
also be judged according to the standard of a "reasonable observer." ***
The conclusion here that, in this particular context, the menorah's display does
not have an effect of endorsing religious faith does not foreclose the possibility
that the display of the menorah might violate either the "purpose" or
"entanglement" prong of the Lemon analysis. These issues were not addressed
by the Court of Appeals and may be considered by that court on remand.
VII
Lynch v. Donnelly confirms, and in no way repudiates, the longstanding
constitutional principle that government may not engage in a practice that has
the effect of promoting or endorsing religious beliefs. The display of the crèche
in the county courthouse has this unconstitutional effect. The display of the
menorah in front of the City-County Building, however, does not have this effect,
given its "particular physical setting."
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part,
and the cases are remanded for further proceedings.
It is so ordered.

Judicial review of government action under the Establishment Clause is a
delicate task. The Court has avoided drawing lines which entirely sweep away
all government recognition and acknowledgment of the role of religion in the
lives of our citizens for to do so would exhibit not neutrality but hostility to
religion. Instead the courts have made case-specific examinations of the
challenged government action and have attempted to do so with the aid of the
standards described by Justice Blackmun in Part III-A of the Court's opinion.
Unfortunately, even the development of articulable standards and guidelines
has not always resulted in agreement among the Members of this Court on the
results in individual cases. And so it is again today. ***

The majority holds that the County of Allegheny violated the Establishment
Clause by displaying a crèche in the county courthouse, because the "principal

Robson

1027

The First Amendment

or primary effect" of the display is to advance religion within the meaning of
Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971). This view of the Establishment Clause reflects an
unjustified hostility toward religion, a hostility inconsistent with our history
and our precedents, and I dissent from this holding. The crèche display is
constitutional, and, for the same reasons, the display of a menorah by the city
of Pittsburgh is permissible as well. On this latter point, I concur in the result,
but not the reasoning, of Part VI of Justice Blackmun's opinion.
I
In keeping with the usual fashion of recent years, the majority applies the
Lemon test to judge the constitutionality of the holiday displays here in question.
I am content for present purposes to remain within the Lemon framework, but
do not wish to be seen as advocating, let alone adopting, that test as our
primary guide in this difficult area. Persuasive criticism of Lemon has emerged.
Our cases often question its utility in providing concrete answers to
Establishment Clause questions, calling it but a "`helpful signpos[t]'" or
"`guidelin[e]'" to assist our deliberations rather than a comprehensive test.
Substantial revision of our Establishment Clause doctrine may be in order; but
it is unnecessary to undertake that task today, for even the Lemon test, when
applied with proper sensitivity to our traditions and our case law, supports the
conclusion that both the crèche and the menorah are permissible displays in
the context of the holiday season.
The only Lemon factor implicated in these cases directs us to inquire whether
the "principal or primary effect" of the challenged government practice is "one
that neither advances nor inhibits religion." ***
*** Noncoercive government action within the realm of flexible accommodation
or passive acknowledgment of existing symbols does not violate the
Establishment Clause unless it benefits religion in a way more direct and more
substantial than practices that are accepted in our national heritage.
II
*** If government is to participate in its citizens' celebration of a holiday that
contains both a secular and a religious component, enforced recognition of only
the secular aspect would signify the callous indifference toward religious faith
that our cases and traditions do not require; for by commemorating the holiday
only as it is celebrated by nonadherents, the government would be refusing to
acknowledge the plain fact, and the historical reality, that many of its citizens
celebrate its religious aspects as well. Judicial invalidation of government's
attempts to recognize the religious underpinnings of the holiday would signal
not neutrality but a pervasive intent to insulate government from all things
religious. The Religion Clauses do not require government to acknowledge these
holidays or their religious component; but our strong tradition of government
accommodation and acknowledgment permits government to do so.
There is no suggestion here that the government's power to coerce has been
used to further the interests of Christianity or Judaism in any way. No one was
compelled to observe or participate in any religious ceremony or activity.
Neither the city nor the county contributed significant amounts of tax money to
serve the cause of one religious faith. The crèche and the menorah are purely
passive symbols of religious holidays. Passersby who disagree with the message

Robson

1028

The First Amendment

conveyed by these displays are free to ignore them, or even to turn their backs,
just as they are free to do when they disagree with any other form of
government speech.
There is no realistic risk that the crèche and the menorah represent an effort to
proselytize or are otherwise the first step down the road to an establishment of
religion. ***
III
*** The United States Code itself contains religious references that would be
suspect under the endorsement test. Congress has directed the President to
"set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year . . . as a National Day of Prayer,
on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and
meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals." This statute does not
require anyone to pray, of course, but it is a straightforward endorsement of the
concept of "turn[ing] to God in prayer." Also by statute, the Pledge of Allegiance
to the Flag describes the United States as "one Nation under God." To be sure,
no one is obligated to recite this phrase, see West Virginia State Board of
Education v. Barnette (1943), but it borders on sophistry to suggest that the
"`reasonable'" atheist would not feel less than a "`full membe[r] of the political
community'" every time his fellow Americans recited, as part of their expression
of patriotism and love for country, a phrase he believed to be false. Likewise,
our national motto, "In God we trust," which is prominently engraved in the
wall above the Speaker's dias in the Chamber of the House of Representatives
and is reproduced on every coin minted and every dollar printed by the Federal
Government, must have the same effect. ***
B
In addition to disregarding precedent and historical fact, the majority's
approach to government use of religious symbolism threatens to trivialize
constitutional adjudication. By mischaracterizing the Court's opinion in Lynch
as an endorsement-in-context test, Justice Blackmun embraces a
jurisprudence of minutiae. A reviewing court must consider whether the city
has included Santas, talking wishing wells, reindeer, or other secular symbols
as "a center of attention separate from the crèche." After determining whether
these centers of attention are sufficiently "separate" that each "had their specific
visual story to tell," the court must then measure their proximity to the crèche.
A community that wishes to construct a constitutional display must also take
care to avoid floral frames or other devices that might insulate the crèche from
the sanitizing effect of the secular portions of the display. The majority also
notes the presence of evergreens near the crèche that are identical to two small
evergreens placed near official county signs. After today's decision, municipal
greenery must be used with care.
*** My description of the majority's test, though perhaps uncharitable, is
intended to illustrate the inevitable difficulties with its application.

Robson

1029

The First Amendment

IV
The approach adopted by the majority contradicts important values embodied
in the Clause. Obsessive, implacable resistance to all but the most carefully
scripted and secularized forms of accommodation requires this Court to act as a
censor, issuing national decrees as to what is orthodox and what is not. What is
orthodox, in this context, means what is secular; the only Christmas the State
can acknowledge is one in which references to religion have been held to a
minimum. The Court thus lends its assistance to an Orwellian rewriting of
history as many understand it. I can conceive of no judicial function more
antithetical to the First Amendment.
A further contradiction arises from the majority's approach, for the Court also
assumes the difficult and inappropriate task of saying what every religious
symbol means. Before studying these cases, I had not known the full history of
the menorah, and I suspect the same was true of my colleagues. More
important, this history was, and is, likely unknown to the vast majority of
people of all faiths who saw the symbol displayed in Pittsburgh. Even if the
majority is quite right about the history of the menorah, it hardly follows that
this same history informed the observers' view of the symbol and the reason for
its presence. This Court is ill equipped to sit as a national theology board, and I
question both the wisdom and the constitutionality of its doing so. Indeed, were
I required to choose between the approach taken by the majority and a strict
separationist view, I would have to respect the consistency of the latter.
The suit before us is admittedly a troubling one. It must be conceded that,
however neutral the purpose of the city and county, the eager proselytizer may
seek to use these symbols for his own ends. The urge to use them to teach or to
taunt is always present. It is also true that some devout adherents of Judaism
or Christianity may be as offended by the holiday display as are nonbelievers, if
not more so. To place these religious symbols in a common hallway or sidewalk,
where they may be ignored or even insulted, must be distasteful to many who
cherish their meaning.
For these reasons, I might have voted against installation of these particular
displays were I a local legislative official. But we have no jurisdiction over
matters of taste within the realm of constitutionally permissible discretion. Our
role is enforcement of a written Constitution. In my view, the principles of the
Establishment Clause and our Nation's historic traditions of diversity and
pluralism allow communities to make reasonable judgments respecting the
accommodation or acknowledgment of holidays with both cultural and religious
aspects. No constitutional violation occurs when they do so by displaying a
symbol of the holiday's religious origins.

DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH REHNQUIST, C. J., AND THOMAS, J., JOINED, AND IN WHICH

JUSTICE SOUTER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Executives of two counties posted a version of the Ten Commandments on the
walls of their courthouses. After suits were filed charging violations of the
Establishment Clause, the legislative body of each county adopted a resolution
calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are
Kentucky's "precedent legal code." The result in each instance was a modified
display of the Commandments surrounded by texts containing religious
references as their sole common element. After changing counsel, the counties
revised the exhibits again by eliminating some documents, expanding the text
set out in another, and adding some new ones.
The issues are whether a determination of the counties' purpose is a sound
basis for ruling on the Establishment Clause complaints, and whether
evaluation of the counties' claim of secular purpose for the ultimate displays
may take their evolution into account. We hold that the counties' manifest
objective may be dispositive of the constitutional enquiry, and that the
development of the presentation should be considered when determining its
purpose.
I
In the summer of 1999, petitioners McCreary County and Pulaski County,
Kentucky (hereinafter Counties), put up in their respective courthouses large,
gold-framed copies of an abridged text of the King James version of the Ten
Commandments, including a citation to the Book of Exodus. In McCreary
County, the placement of the Commandments responded to an order of the
county legislative body requiring "the display [to] be posted in 'a very high traffic
area' of the courthouse." In Pulaski County, amidst reported controversy over
the propriety of the display, the Commandments were hung in a ceremony
presided over by the county Judge-Executive, who called them "good rules to
live by" and who recounted the story of an astronaut who became convinced
"there must be a divine God" after viewing the Earth from the moon. The
Judge-Executive was accompanied by the pastor of his church, who called the
Commandments "a creed of ethics" and told the press after the ceremony that
displaying the Commandments was "one of the greatest things the judge could
have done to close out the millennium." In both counties, this was the version
of the Commandments posted:
"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven images.
"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.
"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
"Honor thy father and thy mother.
"Thou shalt not kill.

Robson

1032

The First Amendment

"Thou shalt not commit adultery.
"Thou shalt not steal.
"Thou shalt not bear false witness.
"Thou shalt not covet.
"Exodus 20:3-17."

In each county, the hallway display was "readily visible to ... county citizens
who use the courthouse to conduct their civic business, to obtain or renew
driver's licenses and permits, to register cars, to pay local taxes, and to register
to vote."
In November 1999, respondents American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky et.
al. sued the Counties in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42
U.S.C. §1983, and sought a preliminary injunction against maintaining the
displays, which the ACLU charged were violations of the prohibition of religious
establishment included in the First Amendment of the Constitution. Within a
month, and before the District Court had responded to the request for
injunction, the legislative body of each County authorized a second, expanded
display, by nearly identical resolutions reciting that the Ten Commandments
are "the precedent legal code upon which the civil and criminal codes of ...
Kentucky are founded," and stating several grounds for taking that position:
that "the Ten Commandments are codified in Kentucky's civil and criminal
laws"; that the Kentucky House of Representatives had in 1993 "voted
unanimously ... to adjourn ... 'in remembrance and honor of Jesus Christ, the
Prince of Ethics'"; that the "County Judge and ... magistrates agree with the
arguments set out by Judge [Roy] Moore" in defense of his "display [of] the Ten
Commandments in his courtroom"; and that the "Founding Father[s] [had an]
explicit understanding of the duty of elected officials to publicly acknowledge
God as the source of America's strength and direction."
As directed by the resolutions, the Counties expanded the displays of the Ten
Commandments in their locations, presumably along with copies of the
resolution, which instructed that it, too, be posted. In addition to the first
display's large framed copy of the edited King James version of the
Commandments, the second included eight other documents in smaller frames,
each either having a religious theme or excerpted to highlight a religious
element. The documents were the "endowed by their Creator" passage from the
Declaration of Independence; the Preamble to the Constitution of Kentucky; the
national motto, "In God We Trust"; a page from the Congressional Record of
February 2, 1983, proclaiming the Year of the Bible and including a statement
of the Ten Commandments; a proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln
designating April 30, 1863, a National Day of Prayer and Humiliation; an
excerpt from President Lincoln's "Reply to Loyal Colored People of Baltimore
upon Presentation of a Bible," reading that "[t]he Bible is the best gift God has
ever given to man"; a proclamation by President Reagan marking 1983 the Year
of the Bible; and the Mayflower Compact.
After argument, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction on May 5,
2000, ordering that the "display ... be removed from [each] County Courthouse
IMMEDIATELY" and that no county official "erect or cause to be erected similar
displays."
The court's analysis of the situation followed the three-part
formulation first stated in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971). As to governmental

Robson

1033

The First Amendment

purpose, it concluded that the original display "lack[ed] any secular purpose"
because the Commandments "are a distinctly religious document, believed by
many Christians and Jews to be the direct and revealed word of God." Although
the Counties had maintained that the original display was meant to be
educational, "[t]he narrow scope of the display--a single religious text
unaccompanied by any interpretation explaining its role as a foundational
document--can hardly be said to present meaningfully the story of this
country's religious traditions." The court found that the second version also
"clearly lack[ed] a secular purpose" because the "Count[ies] narrowly tailored
[their] selection of foundational documents to incorporate only those with
specific references to Christianity."
The Counties filed a notice of appeal from the preliminary injunction but
voluntarily dismissed it after hiring new lawyers. They then installed another
display in each courthouse, the third within a year. No new resolution
authorized this one, nor did the Counties repeal the resolutions that preceded
the second. The posting consists of nine framed documents of equal size, one of
them setting out the Ten Commandments explicitly identified as the "King
James Version" at Exodus 20:3-17 and quoted at greater length than before:
"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing
that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water
underneath the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them:
for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.
"Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will
not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
"Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land
which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
"Thou shalt not kill.
"Thou shalt not commit adultery.
"Thou shalt not steal.
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet th[y]
neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass,
nor anything that is th[y] neighbour's."

Assembled with the Commandments are framed copies of the Magna Carta, the
Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the lyrics of the Star Spangled
Banner, the Mayflower Compact, the National Motto, the Preamble to the
Kentucky Constitution, and a picture of Lady Justice. The collection is entitled
"The Foundations of American Law and Government Display" and each
document comes with a statement about its historical and legal significance.
The comment on the Ten Commandments reads:
"The Ten Commandments have profoundly influenced the formation of Western
legal thought and the formation of our country. That influence is clearly seen in
the Declaration of Independence, which declared that 'We hold these truths to
be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and
the pursuit of Happiness.' The Ten Commandments provide the moral

Robson

1034

The First Amendment

background of the Declaration of Independence and the foundation of our legal
tradition."

The ACLU moved to supplement the preliminary injunction to enjoin the
Counties' third display, and the Counties responded with several explanations
for the new version, including desires "to demonstrate that the Ten
Commandments were part of the foundation of American Law and Government"
and "to educate the citizens of the county regarding some of the documents that
played a significant role in the foundation of our system of law and
government."
The court, however, took the objective of proclaiming the
Commandments' foundational value as "a religious, rather than secular,
purpose" *** and found that the assertion that the Counties' broader
educational goals are secular "crumble[s] ... upon an examination of the history
of this litigation." ***
As requested, the trial court supplemented the injunction, and a divided panel
of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. ***
We granted certiorari and now affirm.
II
Twenty-five years ago in a case prompted by posting the Ten Commandments in
Kentucky's public schools, this Court recognized that the Commandments "are
undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths" and held that their
display in public classrooms violated the First Amendment's bar against
establishment of religion. Stone v. Graham (1980). Stone found a predominantly
religious purpose in the government's posting of the Commandments, given
their prominence as "'an instrument of religion.'" The Counties ask for a
different approach here by arguing that official purpose is unknowable and the
search for it inherently vain. In the alternative, the Counties would avoid the
District Court's conclusion by having us limit the scope of the purpose enquiry
so severely that any trivial rationalization would suffice, under a standard
oblivious to the history of religious government action like the progression of
exhibits in this case.
A
Ever since Lemon v. Kurtzman summarized the three familiar considerations for
evaluating Establishment Clause claims, looking to whether government action
has "a secular legislative purpose" has been a common, albeit seldom
dispositive, element of our cases. Though we have found government action
motivated by an illegitimate purpose only four times since Lemon, and "the
secular purpose requirement alone may rarely be determinative..., it
nevertheless serves an important function."
The touchstone for our analysis is the principle that the "First Amendment
mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion, and between
religion and nonreligion." When the government acts with the ostensible and
predominant purpose of advancing religion, it violates that central
Establishment Clause value of official religious neutrality, there being no
neutrality when the government's ostensible object is to take sides. Manifesting
a purpose to favor one faith over another, or adherence to religion generally,
clashes with the "understanding, reached ... after decades of religious war, that
liberty and social stability demand a religious tolerance that respects the

Robson

1035

The First Amendment

religious views of all citizens ...." By showing a purpose to favor religion, the
government "sends the ... message to ... nonadherents 'that they are outsiders,
not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to
adherents that they are insiders, favored members....'"
Indeed, the purpose apparent from government action can have an impact more
significant than the result expressly decreed: when the government maintains
Sunday closing laws, it advances religion only minimally because many working
people would take the day as one of rest regardless, but if the government
justified its decision with a stated desire for all Americans to honor Christ, the
divisive thrust of the official action would be inescapable. This is the teaching of
McGowan v. Maryland (1961), which upheld Sunday closing statutes on
practical, secular grounds after finding that the government had forsaken the
religious purposes behind centuries-old predecessor laws.
B
Despite the intuitive importance of official purpose to the realization of
Establishment Clause values, the Counties ask us to abandon Lemon's purpose
test, or at least to truncate any enquiry into purpose here. Their first argument
is that the very consideration of purpose is deceptive: according to them, true
"purpose" is unknowable, and its search merely an excuse for courts to act
selectively and unpredictably in picking out evidence of subjective intent. The
assertions are as seismic as they are unconvincing.
Examination of purpose is a staple of statutory interpretation that makes up
the daily fare of every appellate court in the country, and governmental purpose
is a key element of a good deal of constitutional doctrine, e.g., Washington v.
Davis (1976) (discriminatory purpose required for Equal Protection violation);
Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n (1977) (discriminatory
purpose relevant to dormant Commerce Clause claim); Church of Lukumi Babalu
Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah (1993) (discriminatory purpose raises level of scrutiny
required by free exercise claim). With enquiries into purpose this common, if
they were nothing but hunts for mares' nests deflecting attention from bare
judicial will, the whole notion of purpose in law would have dropped into
disrepute long ago.
But scrutinizing purpose does make practical sense, as in Establishment
Clause analysis, where an understanding of official objective emerges from
readily discoverable fact, without any judicial psychoanalysis of a drafter's heart
of hearts. The eyes that look to purpose belong to an "'objective observer,'" one
who takes account of the traditional external signs that show up in the "'text,
legislative history, and implementation of the statute,'" or comparable official
act. Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe. There is, then, nothing hinting at
an unpredictable or disingenuous exercise when a court enquires into purpose
after a claim is raised under the Establishment Clause.
The cases with findings of a predominantly religious purpose point to the
straightforward nature of the test. ***
C
After declining the invitation to abandon concern with purpose wholesale, we
also have to avoid the Counties' alternative tack of trivializing the enquiry into it.
The Counties would read the cases as if the purpose enquiry were so naive that

Robson

1036

The First Amendment

any transparent claim to secularity would satisfy it, and they would cut context
out of the enquiry, to the point of ignoring history, no matter what bearing it
actually had on the significance of current circumstances. There is no
precedent for the Counties' arguments, or reason supporting them.
1
Lemon said that government action must have "a secular ... purpose," and after
a host of cases it is fair to add that although a legislature's stated reasons will
generally get deference, the secular purpose required has to be genuine, not a
sham, and not merely secondary to a religious objective. ***
2
The Counties' second proffered limitation can be dispatched quickly. They argue
that purpose in a case like this one should be inferred, if at all, only from the
latest news about the last in a series of governmental actions, however close
they may all be in time and subject. But the world is not made brand new every
morning, and the Counties are simply asking us to ignore perfectly probative
evidence; they want an absentminded objective observer, not one presumed to
be familiar with the history of the government's actions and competent to learn
what history has to show. The Counties' position just bucks common sense:
reasonable observers have reasonable memories, and our precedents sensibly
forbid an observer "to turn a blind eye to the context in which [the] policy
arose."
III
This case comes to us on appeal from a preliminary injunction. We accordingly
review the District Court's legal rulings de novo, and its ultimate conclusion for
abuse of discretion.
We take Stone as the initial legal benchmark, our only case dealing with the
constitutionality of displaying the Commandments. Stone recognized that the
Commandments are an "instrument of religion" and that, at least on the facts
before it, the display of their text could presumptively be understood as meant
to advance religion: although state law specifically required their posting in
public school classrooms, their isolated exhibition did not leave room even for
an argument that secular education explained their being there.
But Stone did not purport to decide the constitutionality of every possible way
the Commandments might be set out by the government, and under the
Establishment Clause detail is key. Hence, we look to the record of evidence
showing the progression leading up to the third display of the Commandments.
A
The display rejected in Stone had two obvious similarities to the first one in the
sequence here: both set out a text of the Commandments as distinct from any
traditionally symbolic representation, and each stood alone, not part of an
arguably secular display. Stone stressed the significance of integrating the
Commandments into a secular scheme to forestall the broadcast of an
otherwise clearly religious message, and for good reason, the Commandments
being a central point of reference in the religious and moral history of Jews and
Christians. They proclaim the existence of a monotheistic god (no other gods).
They regulate details of religious obligation (no graven images, no sabbath
breaking, no vain oath swearing). And they unmistakably rest even the
universally accepted prohibitions (as against murder, theft, and the like) on the

Robson

1037

The First Amendment

sanction of the divinity proclaimed at the beginning of the text. Displaying that
text is thus different from a symbolic depiction, like tablets with 10 roman
numerals, which could be seen as alluding to a general notion of law, not a
sectarian conception of faith. Where the text is set out, the insistence of the
religious message is hard to avoid in the absence of a context plausibly
suggesting a message going beyond an excuse to promote the religious point of
view.
***What is more, at the ceremony for posting the framed Commandments in
Pulaski County, the county executive was accompanied by his pastor, who
testified to the certainty of the existence of God. The reasonable observer could
only think that the Counties meant to emphasize and celebrate the
Commandments' religious message.
This is not to deny that the Commandments have had influence on civil or
secular law; a major text of a majority religion is bound to be felt. The point is
simply that the original text viewed in its entirety is an unmistakably religious
statement dealing with religious obligations and with morality subject to
religious sanction. When the government initiates an effort to place this
statement alone in public view, a religious object is unmistakable.
B
Once the Counties were sued, they modified the exhibits and invited additional
insight into their purpose in a display that hung for about six months. ***
Today, the Counties make no attempt to defend their undeniable objective, but
instead hopefully describe version two as "dead and buried." Their refusal to
defend the second display is understandable, but the reasonable observer could
not forget it.
C
1
After the Counties changed lawyers, they mounted a third display, without a
new resolution or repeal of the old one.
*** Nor did the selection of posted material suggest a clear theme that might
prevail over evidence of the continuing religious object. In a collection of
documents said to be "foundational" to American government, it is at least odd
to include a patriotic anthem, but to omit the Fourteenth Amendment, the most
significant structural provision adopted since the original Framing. And it is no
less baffling to leave out the original Constitution of 1787 while quoting the
1215 Magna Carta even to the point of its declaration that "fish-weirs shall be
removed from the Thames." If an observer found these choices and omissions
perplexing in isolation, he would be puzzled for a different reason when he read
the Declaration of Independence seeking confirmation for the Counties' posted
explanation that the "Ten Commandments' ... influence is clearly seen in the
Declaration;” in fact the observer would find that the Commandments are
sanctioned as divine imperatives, while the Declaration of Independence holds
that the authority of government to enforce the law derives "from the consent of
the governed." If the observer had not thrown up his hands, he would probably
suspect that the Counties were simply reaching for any way to keep a religious
document on the walls of courthouses constitutionally required to embody
religious neutrality.

Robson

1038

The First Amendment

2
In holding the preliminary injunction adequately supported by evidence that the
Counties' purpose had not changed at the third stage, we do not decide that the
Counties' past actions forever taint any effort on their part to deal with the
subject matter. We hold only that purpose needs to be taken seriously under
the Establishment Clause and needs to be understood in light of context; an
implausible claim that governmental purpose has changed should not carry the
day in a court of law any more than in a head with common sense. ***
Nor do we have occasion here to hold that a sacred text can never be integrated
constitutionally into a governmental display on the subject of law, or American
history. We do not forget, and in this litigation have frequently been reminded,
that our own courtroom frieze was deliberately designed in the exercise of
governmental authority so as to include the figure of Moses holding tablets
exhibiting a portion of the Hebrew text of the later, secularly phrased
Commandments; in the company of 17 other lawgivers, most of them secular
figures, there is no risk that Moses would strike an observer as evidence that
the National Government was violating neutrality in religion.
IV
The importance of neutrality as an interpretive guide is no less true now than it
was when the Court broached the principle in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing
(1947), and a word needs to be said about the different view taken in today's
dissent.
*** But the dissent's argument for the original understanding is flawed from the
outset by its failure to consider the full range of evidence showing what the
Framers believed. ***
[T]here is also evidence supporting the proposition that the Framers intended
the Establishment Clause to require governmental neutrality in matters of
religion, including neutrality in statements acknowledging religion. The very
language of the Establishment Clause represented a significant departure from
early drafts that merely prohibited a single national religion, and, the final
language instead "extended [the] prohibition to state support for 'religion' in
general."
The historical record, moreover, is complicated beyond the dissent's account by
the writings and practices of figures no less influential than Thomas Jefferson
and James Madison. Jefferson, for example, refused to issue Thanksgiving
Proclamations because he believed that they violated the Constitution. And
Madison, whom the dissent claims as supporting its thesis, criticized Virginia's
general assessment tax not just because it required people to donate "three
pence" to religion, but because "it is itself a signal of persecution. It degrades
from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend
to those of the Legislative authority."
The fair inference is that there was no common understanding about the limits
of the establishment prohibition, and the dissent's conclusion that its narrower
view was the original understanding, stretches the evidence beyond tensile
capacity. What the evidence does show is a group of statesmen, like others
before and after them, who proposed a guarantee with contours not wholly
worked out, leaving the Establishment Clause with edges still to be determined.

Robson

1039

The First Amendment

And none the worse for that. Indeterminate edges are the kind to have in a
constitution meant to endure, and to meet "exigencies which, if foreseen at all,
must have been seen dimly, and which can be best provided for as they occur."
McCulloch v. Maryland (1819).
While the dissent fails to show a consistent original understanding from which
to argue that the neutrality principle should be rejected, it does manage to
deliver a surprise. As mentioned, the dissent says that the deity the Framers
had in mind was the God of monotheism, with the consequence that
government may espouse a tenet of traditional monotheism. This is truly a
remarkable view. *** Today's dissent, however, apparently means that
government should be free to approve the core beliefs of a favored religion over
the tenets of others, a view that should trouble anyone who prizes religious
liberty. Certainly history cannot justify it; on the contrary, history shows that
the religion of concern to the Framers was not that of the monotheistic faiths
generally, but Christianity in particular, a fact that no member of this Court
takes as a premise for construing the Religion Clauses. ***
Historical evidence thus supports no solid argument for changing course
(whatever force the argument might have when directed at the existing
precedent), whereas public discourse at the present time certainly raises no
doubt about the value of the interpretative approach invoked for 60 years now.
We are centuries away from the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and the
treatment of heretics in early Massachusetts, but the divisiveness of religion in
current public life is inescapable. This is no time to deny the prudence of
understanding the Establishment Clause to require the Government to stay
neutral on religious belief, which is reserved for the conscience of the individual.
V
Given the ample support for the District Court's finding of a predominantly
religious purpose behind the Counties' third display, we affirm the Sixth Circuit
in upholding the preliminary injunction.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, CONCURRING [OMITTED].

I would uphold McCreary County and Pulaski County, Kentucky's (hereinafter
Counties) displays of the Ten Commandments. I shall discuss first, why the
Court's oft repeated assertion that the government cannot favor religious
practice is false; second, why today's opinion extends the scope of that
falsehood even beyond prior cases; and third, why even on the basis of the
Court's false assumptions the judgment here is wrong.

II

Robson

The First Amendment

As bad as the Lemon test is, it is worse for the fact that, since its inception, its
seemingly simple mandates have been manipulated to fit whatever result the
Court aimed to achieve. Today's opinion is no different. In two respects it
modifies Lemon to ratchet up the Court's hostility to religion. First, the Court
justifies inquiry into legislative purpose, not as an end itself, but as a means to
ascertain the appearance of the government action to an "'objective observer.'"
Because in the Court's view the true danger to be guarded against is that the
objective observer would feel like an "outside[r]" or "not [a] full membe[r] of the
political community," its inquiry focuses not on the actual purpose of
government action, but the "purpose apparent from government action." Under
this approach, even if a government could show that its actual purpose was not
to advance religion, it would presumably violate the Constitution as long as the
Court's objective observer would think otherwise.
I have remarked before that it is an odd jurisprudence that bases the
unconstitutionality of a government practice that does not actually advance
religion on the hopes of the government that it would do so. But that oddity
pales in comparison to the one invited by today's analysis: the legitimacy of a
government action with a wholly secular effect would turn on the misperception
of an imaginary observer that the government officials behind the action had
the intent to advance religion.
Second, the Court replaces Lemon's requirement that the government have "a
secular . . . purpose," with the heightened requirement that the secular purpose
"predominate" over any purpose to advance religion. The Court treats this
extension as a natural outgrowth of the longstanding requirement that the
government's secular purpose not be a sham, but simple logic shows the two to
be unrelated. If the government's proffered secular purpose is not genuine, then
the government has no secular purpose at all. The new demand that secular
purpose predominate contradicts Lemon's more limited requirement, and finds
no support in our cases. ***
I have urged that Lemon's purpose prong be abandoned, because (as I have
discussed in Part I) even an exclusive purpose to foster or assist religious
practice is not necessarily invalidating. But today's extension makes things
even worse. By shifting the focus of Lemon's purpose prong from the search for
a genuine, secular motivation to the hunt for a predominantly religious purpose,
the Court converts what has in the past been a fairly limited inquiry into a
rigorous review of the full record. Those responsible for the adoption of the
Religion Clauses would surely regard it as a bitter irony that the religious
values they designed those Clauses to protect have now become so distasteful
to this Court that if they constitute anything more than a subordinate motive
for government action they will invalidate it.
III
Even accepting the Court's Lemon-based premises, the displays at issue here
were constitutional. ***
In sum: The first displays did not necessarily evidence an intent to further
religious practice; nor did the second displays, or the resolutions authorizing
them; and there is in any event no basis for attributing whatever intent
motivated the first and second displays to the third. Given the presumption of

Robson

1041

The First Amendment

regularity that always accompanies our review of official action, the Court has
identified no evidence of a purpose to advance religion in a way that is
inconsistent with our cases. The Court may well be correct in identifying the
third displays as the fruit of a desire to display the Ten Commandments, but
neither our cases nor our history support its assertion that such a desire
renders the fruit poisonous.
For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST ANNOUNCED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT AND
DELIVERED AN OPINION, IN WHICH JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY, AND JUSTICE
THOMAS JOIN.
The question here is whether the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment
allows the display of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on
the Texas State Capitol grounds. We hold that it does.
The 22 acres surrounding the Texas State Capitol contain 17 monuments and
21 historical markers commemorating the "people, ideals, and events that
compose Texan identity." The monolith challenged here stands 6-feet high and
3-feet wide. It is located to the north of the Capitol building, between the
Capitol and the Supreme Court building. Its primary content is the text of the
Ten Commandments. An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a
pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are
carved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are two Stars
of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent
Christ. The bottom of the monument bears the inscription "PRESENTED TO
THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF
EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961."
The legislative record surrounding the State's acceptance of the monument from
the Eagles--a national social, civic, and patriotic organization--is limited to
legislative journal entries. After the monument was accepted, the State selected
a site for the monument based on the recommendation of the state organization
responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds. The Eagles paid the cost of
erecting the monument, the dedication of which was presided over by two state
legislators.
Petitioner Thomas Van Orden is a native Texan and a resident of Austin. At one
time he was a licensed lawyer, having graduated from Southern Methodist Law
School. Van Orden testified that, since 1995, he has encountered the Ten

Robson

1042

The First Amendment

Commandments monument during his frequent visits to the Capitol grounds.
His visits are typically for the purpose of using the law library in the Supreme
Court building, which is located just northwest of the Capitol building.
Forty years after the monument's erection and six years after Van Orden began
to encounter the monument frequently, he sued numerous state officials in
their official capacities under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U.S.C. §1983, seeking both a
declaration that the monument's placement violates the Establishment Clause
and an injunction requiring its removal. After a bench trial, the District Court
held that the monument did not contravene the Establishment Clause. It found
that the State had a valid secular purpose in recognizing and commending the
Eagles for their efforts to reduce juvenile delinquency. The District Court also
determined that a reasonable observer, mindful of the history, purpose, and
context, would not conclude that this passive monument conveyed the message
that the State was seeking to endorse religion. The Court of Appeals affirmed
the District Court's holdings with respect to the monument's purpose and effect.
We granted certiorari and now affirm.
Our cases, Januslike, point in two directions in applying the Establishment
Clause. One face looks toward the strong role played by religion and religious
traditions throughout our Nation's history. ***
The other face looks toward the principle that governmental intervention in
religious matters can itself endanger religious freedom.
This case, like all Establishment Clause challenges, presents us with the
difficulty of respecting both faces. Our institutions presuppose a Supreme
Being, yet these institutions must not press religious observances upon their
citizens. One face looks to the past in acknowledgment of our Nation's heritage,
while the other looks to the present in demanding a separation between church
and state. Reconciling these two faces requires that we neither abdicate our
responsibility to maintain a division between church and state nor evince a
hostility to religion by disabling the government from in some ways recognizing
our religious heritage.***
These two faces are evident in representative cases both upholding and
invalidating laws under the Establishment Clause. Over the last 25 years, we
have sometimes pointed to Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), as providing the
governing test in Establishment Clause challenges. Compare Wallace v. Jaffree,
(1985) (applying Lemon), with Marsh v. Chambers (1983) (not applying Lemon).
Yet, just two years after Lemon was decided, we noted that the factors identified
in Lemon serve as "no more than helpful signposts." Hunt v. McNair (1973).
Many of our recent cases simply have not applied the Lemon test. See, e.g.,
Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002); Good News Club v. Milford Central School
(2001). Others have applied it only after concluding that the challenged practice
was invalid under a different Establishment Clause test.
Whatever may be the fate of the Lemon test in the larger scheme of
Establishment Clause jurisprudence, we think it not useful in dealing with the
sort of passive monument that Texas has erected on its Capitol grounds.
Instead, our analysis is driven both by the nature of the monument and by our
Nation's history.

Robson

1043

The First Amendment

As we explained in Lynch v. Donnelly (1984): "There is an unbroken history of
official acknowledgment by all three branches of government of the role of
religion in American life from at least 1789." ***
Recognition of the role of God in our Nation's heritage has also been reflected in
our decisions. We have acknowledged, for example, that "religion has been
closely identified with our history and government," School Dist. of Abington
Township v. Schempp, and that "[t]he history of man is inseparable from the
history of religion," Engel v. Vitale (1962). This recognition has led us to hold
that the Establishment Clause permits a state legislature to open its daily
sessions with a prayer by a chaplain paid by the State. Marsh v. Chambers. ***
With similar reasoning, we have upheld laws, which originated from one of the
Ten Commandments, that prohibited the sale of merchandise on Sunday.
McGowan v. Maryland (1961).
In this case we are faced with a display of the Ten Commandments on
government property outside the Texas State Capitol. Such acknowledgments of
the role played by the Ten Commandments in our Nation's heritage are common
throughout America. We need only look within our own Courtroom. Since 1935,
Moses has stood, holding two tablets that reveal portions of the Ten
Commandments written in Hebrew, among other lawgivers in the south frieze.
Representations of the Ten Commandments adorn the metal gates lining the
north and south sides of the Courtroom as well as the doors leading into the
Courtroom. Moses also sits on the exterior east facade of the building holding
the Ten Commandments tablets.
Similar acknowledgments can be seen throughout a visitor's tour of our
Nation's Capital. For example, a large statue of Moses holding the Ten
Commandments, alongside a statue of the Apostle Paul, has overlooked the
rotunda of the Library of Congress' Jefferson Building since 1897. And the
Jefferson Building's Great Reading Room contains a sculpture of a woman
beside the Ten Commandments with a quote above her from the Old Testament
(Micah 6:8). A medallion with two tablets depicting the Ten Commandments
decorates the floor of the National Archives. Inside the Department of Justice, a
statue entitled "The Spirit of Law" has two tablets representing the Ten
Commandments lying at its feet. In front of the Ronald Reagan Building is
another sculpture that includes a depiction of the Ten Commandments. So too
a 24-foot-tall sculpture, depicting, among other things, the Ten
Commandments and a cross, stands outside the federal courthouse that
houses both the Court of Appeals and the District Court for the District of
Columbia. Moses is also prominently featured in the Chamber of the United
States House of Representatives.
Our opinions, like our building, have recognized the role the Decalogue plays in
America's heritage. See, e.g., McGowan v. Maryland (separate opinion of
Frankfurter, J.). The Executive and Legislative Branches have also
acknowledged the historical role of the Ten Commandments. See, e.g., Public
Papers of the Presidents, Harry S. Truman, 1950, p. 157 (1965); S. Con. Res. 13,
105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997); H. Con. Res. 31, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997).
These displays and recognitions of the Ten Commandments bespeak the rich
American tradition of religious acknowledgments.

Robson

1044

The First Amendment

Of course, the Ten Commandments are religious--they were so viewed at their
inception and so remain. The monument, therefore, has religious significance.
According to Judeo-Christian belief, the Ten Commandments were given to
Moses by God on Mt. Sinai. But Moses was a lawgiver as well as a religious
leader. And the Ten Commandments have an undeniable historical meaning, as
the foregoing examples demonstrate. Simply having religious content or
promoting a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of
the Establishment Clause. See Lynch v. Donnelly; Marsh v. Chambers;
McGowan v. Maryland; Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York (1970).
There are, of course, limits to the display of religious messages or symbols. For
example, we held unconstitutional a Kentucky statute requiring the posting of
the Ten Commandments in every public schoolroom. Stone v. Graham (1980)
(per curiam). In the classroom context, we found that the Kentucky statute had
an improper and plainly religious purpose. As evidenced by Stone's almost
exclusive reliance upon two of our school prayer cases, School Dist. of Abington
Township v. Schempp (1963), and Engel v. Vitale (1962), it stands as an example
of the fact that we have "been particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance
with the Establishment Clause in elementary and secondary schools," Edwards
v. Aguillard (1987). Compare Lee v. Weisman (1992) (holding unconstitutional a
prayer at a secondary school graduation), with Marsh v. Chambers (upholding a
prayer in the state legislature). Indeed, Edwards v. Aguillard recognized that
Stone--along with Schempp and Engel--was a consequence of the "particular
concerns that arise in the context of public elementary and secondary schools."
Neither Stone itself nor subsequent opinions have indicated that Stone's holding
would extend to a legislative chamber, see Marsh v. Chambers, supra, or to
capitol grounds.
The placement of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State
Capitol grounds is a far more passive use of those texts than was the case in
Stone, where the text confronted elementary school students every day. Indeed,
Van Orden, the petitioner here, apparently walked by the monument for a
number of years before bringing this lawsuit. The monument is therefore also
quite different from the prayers involved in Schempp and Lee v. Weisman. Texas
has treated her Capitol grounds monuments as representing the several
strands in the State's political and legal history. The inclusion of the Ten
Commandments monument in this group has a dual significance, partaking of
both religion and government. We cannot say that Texas' display of this
monument violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SCALIA, CONCURRING.
I join the opinion of The Chief Justice because I think it accurately reflects our
current Establishment Clause jurisprudence--or at least the Establishment
Clause jurisprudence we currently apply some of the time. I would prefer to
reach the same result by adopting an Establishment Clause jurisprudence that
is in accord with our Nation's past and present practices, and that can be

Robson

1045

The First Amendment

consistently applied--the central relevant feature of which is that there is
nothing unconstitutional in a State's favoring religion generally, honoring God
through public prayer and acknowledgment, or, in a nonproselytizing manner,
venerating the Ten Commandments.
JUSTICE THOMAS, CONCURRING.
*** This case would be easy if the Court were willing to abandon the
inconsistent guideposts it has adopted for addressing Establishment Clause
challenges,** and return to the original meaning of the Clause. I have previously
suggested that the Clause's text and history "resis[t] incorporation" against the
States. If the Establishment Clause does not restrain the States, then it has no
application here, where only state action is at issue. ***
JUSTICE BREYER, CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
*** The case before us is a borderline case. It concerns a large granite
monument bearing the text of the Ten Commandments located on the grounds
of the Texas State Capitol. On the one hand, the Commandments' text
undeniably has a religious message, invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Diety.
On the other hand, focusing on the text of the Commandments alone cannot
conclusively resolve this case. Rather, to determine the message that the text
here conveys, we must examine how the text is used. And that inquiry requires
us to consider the context of the display.
In certain contexts, a display of the tablets of the Ten Commandments can
convey not simply a religious message but also a secular moral message (about
proper standards of social conduct). And in certain contexts, a display of the
tablets can also convey a historical message (about a historic relation between
those standards and the law)--a fact that helps to explain the display of those
tablets in dozens of courthouses throughout the Nation, including the Supreme
Court of the United States.
Here the tablets have been used as part of a display that communicates not
simply a religious message, but a secular message as well. The circumstances
surrounding the display's placement on the capitol grounds and its physical
setting suggest that the State itself intended the latter, nonreligious aspects of
the tablets' message to predominate. And the monument's 40-year history on
the Texas state grounds indicates that that has been its effect.
The group that donated the monument, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a private
civic (and primarily secular) organization, while interested in the religious
aspect of the Ten Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments' role
in shaping civic morality as part of that organization's efforts to combat juvenile
delinquency. See 1961 Tex. Gen. Laws 1995. The Eagles' consultation with a
committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a
nonsectarian text underscores the group's ethics-based motives. The tablets, as
displayed on the monument, prominently acknowledge that the Eagles donated
the display, a factor which, though not sufficient, thereby further distances the
State itself from the religious aspect of the Commandments' message.

Robson

1046

The First Amendment

The physical setting of the monument, moreover, suggests little or nothing of
the sacred. The monument sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and
21 historical markers, all designed to illustrate the "ideals" of those who settled
in Texas and of those who have lived there since that time. The setting does not
readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity. But it does
provide a context of history and moral ideals. It (together with the display's
inscription about its origin) communicates to visitors that the State sought to
reflect moral principles, illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the
State's citizens, historically speaking, have endorsed. That is to say, the context
suggests that the State intended the display's moral message--an illustrative
message reflecting the historical "ideals" of Texans--to predominate.
If these factors provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the
Commandments' text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular
message, a further factor is determinative here. As far as I can tell, 40 years
passed in which the presence of this monument, legally speaking, went
unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner). And I am not
aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation.
Hence, those 40 years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests
that few individuals, whatever their system of beliefs, are likely to have
understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way,
to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect, primarily to promote
religion over nonreligion, to "engage in" any "religious practic[e]," to "compel"
any "religious practic[e]," or to "work deterrence" of any "religious belief."
Schempp (Goldberg, J., concurring). Those 40 years suggest that the public
visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets'
message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of
a cultural heritage.
This case, moreover, is distinguishable from instances where the Court has
found Ten Commandments displays impermissible. The display is not on the
grounds of a public school, where, given the impressionability of the young,
government must exercise particular care in separating church and state. See,
e.g., Weisman; Stone v. Graham. This case also differs from McCreary County,
where the short (and stormy) history of the courthouse Commandments'
displays demonstrates the substantially religious objectives of those who
mounted them, and the effect of this readily apparent objective upon those who
view them. That history there indicates a governmental effort substantially to
promote religion, not simply an effort primarily to reflect, historically, the
secular impact of a religiously inspired document. And, in today's world, in a
Nation of so many different religious and comparable nonreligious fundamental
beliefs, a more contemporary state effort to focus attention upon a religious text
is certainly likely to prove divisive in a way that this longstanding, pre-existing
monument has not.
*** But, as I have said, in reaching the conclusion that the Texas display falls
on the permissible side of the constitutional line, I rely less upon a literal
application of any particular test than upon consideration of the basic purposes
of the First Amendment's Religion Clauses themselves. This display has stood
apparently uncontested for nearly two generations. That experience helps us
understand that as a practical matter of degree this display is unlikely to prove

Robson

1047

The First Amendment

divisive. And this matter of degree is, I believe, critical in a borderline case such
as this one.
At the same time, to reach a contrary conclusion here, based primarily upon on
the religious nature of the tablets' text would, I fear, lead the law to exhibit a
hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause
traditions. Such a holding might well encourage disputes concerning the
removal of longstanding depictions of the Ten Commandments from public
buildings across the Nation. And it could thereby create the very kind of
religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid. ***
JUSTICE STEVENS, WITH WHOM JUSTICE GINSBURG JOINS, DISSENTING.
The sole function of the monument on the grounds of Texas' State Capitol is to
display the full text of one version of the Ten Commandments. The monument
is not a work of art and does not refer to any event in the history of the State. It
is significant because, and only because, it communicates the following
message:
“I AM the LORD thy God”
*** [text of 10 Commandments omitted].

Viewed on its face, Texas' display has no purported connection to God's role in
the formation of Texas or the founding of our Nation; nor does it provide the
reasonable observer with any basis to guess that it was erected to honor any
individual or organization. The message transmitted by Texas' chosen display is
quite plain: This State endorses the divine code of the "Judeo-Christian" God.
For those of us who learned to recite the King James version of the text long
before we understood the meaning of some of its words, God's Commandments
may seem like wise counsel. The question before this Court, however, is
whether it is counsel that the State of Texas may proclaim without violating the
Establishment Clause of the Constitution. If any fragment of Jefferson's
metaphorical "wall of separation between church and State" is to be preserved-if there remains any meaning to the "wholesome 'neutrality' of which this
Court's [Establishment Clause] cases speak," --a negative answer to that
question is mandatory.

The First Amendment

JUSTICE SOUTER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEVENS AND JUSTICE GINSBURG JOIN,
DISSENTING.
Although the First Amendment's Religion Clauses have not been read to
mandate absolute governmental neutrality toward religion, the Establishment
Clause requires neutrality as a general rule, e.g., Everson v. Board of Ed. of
Ewing (1947), and thus expresses Madison's condemnation of "employ[ing]
Religion as an engine of Civil policy," Memorial and Remonstrance Against
Religious Assessments. A governmental display of an obviously religious text
cannot be squared with neutrality, except in a setting that plausibly indicates
that the statement is not placed in view with a predominant purpose on the
part of government either to adopt the religious message or to urge its
acceptance by others.
*** Texas seeks to take advantage of the recognition that visual symbol and
written text can manifest a secular purpose in secular company, when it argues
that its monument (like Moses in the frieze) is not alone and ought to be viewed
as only 1 among 17 placed on the 22 acres surrounding the state capitol. Texas,
indeed, says that the Capitol grounds are like a museum for a collection of
exhibits, the kind of setting that several Members of the Court have said can
render the exhibition of religious artifacts permissible, even though in other
circumstances their display would be seen as meant to convey a religious
message forbidden to the State. So, for example, the Government of the United
States does not violate the Establishment Clause by hanging Giotto's Madonna
on the wall of the National Gallery.
But 17 monuments with no common appearance, history, or esthetic role
scattered over 22 acres is not a museum, and anyone strolling around the lawn
would surely take each memorial on its own terms without any dawning sense
that some purpose held the miscellany together more coherently than fortuity
and the edge of the grass. One monument expresses admiration for pioneer
women. One pays respect to the fighters of World War II. And one quotes the
God of Abraham whose command is the sanction for moral law. The themes are
individual grit, patriotic courage, and God as the source of Jewish and
Christian morality; there is no common denominator. In like circumstances, we
rejected an argument similar to the State's, noting in County of Allegheny that
"[t]he presence of Santas or other Christmas decorations elsewhere in the . . .
[c]ourthouse, and of the nearby gallery forum, fail to negate the [crčche's]
endorsement effect. . . . The record demonstrates . . . that the crčche, with its
floral frame, was its own display distinct from any other decorations or
exhibitions in the building."
If the State's museum argument does nothing to blunt the religious message
and manifestly religious purpose behind it, neither does the plurality's reliance
on generalities culled from cases factually different from this one. In fact, it is
not until the end of its opinion that the plurality turns to the relevant precedent
of Stone, a case actually dealing with a display of the Decalogue.
When the plurality finally does confront Stone, it tries to avoid the case's
obvious applicability by limiting its holding to the classroom setting. The
plurality claims to find authority for limiting Stone's reach this way in the
opinion's citations of two school-prayer cases, School Dist. of Abington Township

Robson

1049

The First Amendment

v. Schempp (1963), and Engel v. Vitale (1962). But Stone relied on those cases
for widely applicable notions, not for any concept specific to schools. The
opinion quoted Schempp's statements that "it is no defense to urge that the
religious practices here may be relatively minor encroachments on the First
Amendment;” and that "the place of the Bible as an instrument of religion
cannot be gainsaid." And Engel was cited to support the proposition that the
State was responsible for displaying the Commandments, even though their
framed, printed texts were bought with private subscriptions. Thus, the
schoolroom was beside the point of the citations, and that is presumably why
the Stone Court failed to discuss the educational setting, as other opinions had
done when school was significant. Stone did not, for example, speak of
children's impressionability or their captivity as an audience in a school class.
In fact, Stone's reasoning reached the classroom only in noting the lack of
support for the claim that the State had brought the Commandments into
schools in order to "integrat[e] [them] into the school curriculum." Accordingly,
our numerous prior discussions of Stone have never treated its holding as
restricted to the classroom.
Nor can the plurality deflect Stone by calling the Texas monument "a far more
passive use of [the Decalogue] than was the case in Stone, where the text
confronted elementary school students every day." Placing a monument on the
ground is not more "passive" than hanging a sheet of paper on a wall when both
contain the same text to be read by anyone who looks at it. The problem in
Stone was simply that the State was putting the Commandments there to be
seen, just as the monument's inscription is there for those who walk by it.
To be sure, Kentucky's compulsory-education law meant that the
schoolchildren were forced to see the display every day, whereas many see the
monument by choice, and those who customarily walk the Capitol grounds can
presumably avoid it if they choose. But in my judgment (and under our often
inexact Establishment Clause jurisprudence, such matters often boil down to
judgment [as Breyer, J., concurring states], this distinction should make no
difference. The monument in this case sits on the grounds of the Texas State
Capitol. There is something significant in the common term "statehouse" to
refer to a state capitol building: it is the civic home of every one of the State's
citizens. If neutrality in religion means something, any citizen should be able to
visit that civic home without having to confront religious expressions clearly
meant to convey an official religious position that may be at odds with his own
religion, or with rejection of religion. See County of Allegheny (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("I agree that the crèche
displayed on the Grand Staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse, the seat
of county government, conveys a message to nonadherents of Christianity that
they are not full members of the political community .... The display of religious
symbols in public areas of core government buildings runs a special risk of
making religion relevant, in reality or public perception, to status in the political
community" (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)).
Finally, though this too is a point on which judgment will vary, I do not see a
persuasive argument for constitutionality in the plurality's observation that Van
Orden's lawsuit comes "[f]orty years after the monument's erection . . . ," an
observation that echoes the State's contention that one fact cutting in its favor

Robson

1050

The First Amendment

is that "the monument stood ... in Austin . . . for some forty years without
generating any controversy or litigation." It is not that I think the passage of
time is necessarily irrelevant in Establishment Clause analysis. We have
approved framing-era practices because they must originally have been
understood as constitutionally permissible, e.g., Marsh v. Chambers (1983)
(legislative prayer), and we have recognized that Sunday laws have grown
recognizably secular over time, McGowan v. Maryland (1961). There is also an
analogous argument, not yet evaluated, that ritualistic religious expression can
become so numbing over time that its initial Establishment Clause violation
becomes at some point too diminished for notice. But I do not understand any
of these to be the State's argument, which rather seems to be that 40 years
without a challenge shows that as a factual matter the religious expression is
too tepid to provoke a serious reaction and constitute a violation. Perhaps, but
the writer of Exodus chapter 20 was not lukewarm, and other explanations may
do better in accounting for the late resort to the courts. Suing a State over
religion puts nothing in a plaintiff's pocket and can take a great deal out, and
even with volunteer litigators to supply time and energy, the risk of social
ostracism can be powerfully deterrent. I doubt that a slow walk to the
courthouse, even one that took 40 years, is much evidentiary help in applying
the Establishment Clause.
I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Notes	  
1.
The “Ten Commandments Cases” of McCreary County and Van
Orden were decided the same day, at the end of the 2004-2005 Term.
The cases reached opposite conclusions: in McCreary the Ten
Commandments display violated the Establishment Clause and in Van
Orden the Ten Commandments display did not violate the Establishment
Clause. Both cases were closely divided, 5-4, with a Justice who is not
usually considered to be a “centrist” or “swing vote” responsible for the
difference. Be prepared to discuss the reasoning of this Justice and
whether you agree.
2.
The Court describes Thomas Van Orden as a native Texan and
resident of Austin, who one time was a licensed lawyer, having graduated
from Southern Methodist Law School, and who was encountering the Ten
Commandments monument during his frequent visits to the Capitol
grounds to visit the law library. What do you think motivated Van Orden
to bring the challenge?

The First Amendment

Note:	  Salazar	  v.	  Buono	  
The Court’s fragmented and complicated decision in Salazar v. Buono,
559 U.S. 700 (2010), considers the long-running and controversial
Mojave Desert Cross. In 1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars
(VFW) placed a Latin cross on federal land in the Mojave National
Preserve to honor American soldiers who died in World War I. Frank
Buono, a retired Park Service employee and regular visitor to the
Preserve “claimed to be offended” by a religious symbol’s presence on
federal land.
He brought a suit alleging a violation of the First
Amendment’s Establishment Clause and seeking an injunction requiring
the Government to remove the cross. During some of the litigation, the
eight foot high cross was “boarded over.”
In the litigation’s first stage (Buono I), the District Court found that
Buono had standing to sue and, concluding that the presence of the
cross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental
endorsement of religion applying Lemon v. Kurtzman, it granted Buono’s
requested injunctive relief. The District Court did not consider whether
the Government’s actions regarding the cross had a secular purpose or
caused entanglement with religion.
While the Government’s appeal was pending, Congress passed the
Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004, §8121(a) of which
directed the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the cross and the land
on which it stands to the VFW in exchange for privately owned land
elsewhere in the Preserve. Affirming the District Court’s judgment both
as to standing and on the merits, the Ninth Circuit declined to address
the statute’s effect on Buono’s suit or the statute’s constitutionality
(Buono II). Because the Government did not seek review by this Court,
the Court of Appeals’ judgment became final. Buono then returned to the
District Court seeking injunctive relief against the land transfer, either
through enforcement or modification of the 2002 injunction. In 2005,
that court rejected the Government’s claim that the transfer was a bona
fide attempt to comply with the injunction, concluding, instead, that it
was actually an invalid attempt to keep the cross on display. The court
granted Buono’s motion to enforce the 2002 injunction; denied as moot
his motion to amend it; and permanently enjoined the Government from
implementing the land- transfer statute (Buono III). The Ninth Circuit
again affirmed, largely following the District Court’s reasoning.
The Court’s judgment reversed and remanded the case.
The plurality opinion, authored by Justice Kennedy was joined in full
only by Chief Justice Roberts, and only in part by Justice Alito. Kennedy
concluded that Buono has standing to maintain this action. Whatever

Robson

1052

The First Amendment

the validity of the Government’s argument that Buono’s asserted injury—
offense at a religious symbol’s presence on federal land—is not personal
to him and so does not confer Article III standing, that argument is not
available at this stage of the litigation. Buono’s entitlement to an
injunction having been established in Buono I and II, he sought in
Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or evading that
injunction. His interests in doing so were sufficiently personal and
concrete to support his standing, given the rights he obtained under the
earlier decree against the same party as to the same cross and the same
land. The Government’s contention that Buono sought to extend, rather
than to enforce, the 2002 injunction is not an argument about standing,
but about the merits of the District Court’s order.
Justice Kennedy’s opinion also concluded that the District Court erred in
enjoining the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute
on the premise that the relief was necessary to protect Buono’s rights
under the 2002 injunction. Kennedy reasoned that a court may order an
injunction only after taking into account all the circumstances bearing
on the need for prospective relief. Here, the District Court did not engage
in the appropriate inquiry. The land- transfer statute was a substantial
change in circumstances bearing on the propriety of the requested relief.
By dismissing as illicit the motives of Congress in passing it, the District
Court took insufficient account of the context in which the statute was
enacted and the reasons for its passage. Placement of the cross on
federal land by private persons was not an attempt to set the state’s
imprimatur on a particular creed. Rather, the intent was simply to honor
fallen soldiers. Moreover, the cross stood for nearly seven decades before
the statute was enacted, by which time the cross and the cause it
commemorated had become entwined in the public consciousness. The
2002 injunction thus presented the Government with a dilemma. It could
not maintain the cross without violating the injunction, but it could not
remove the cross without conveying disrespect for those the cross was
seen as honoring. Deeming neither alternative satisfactory, Congress
enacted the land-transfer statute. The statute embodied a legislative
judgment that this dispute is best resolved through a framework and
policy of accommodation. The statute should not have been dismissed as
an evasion, for it brought about a change of law and a congressional
statement of policy applicable to the case.
Thus, because legislative action undermined the basis for previous relief,
the relevant question was whether an ongoing exercise of the court’s
equitable authority is supported by the prior showing of illegality, judged
against the claim that changed circumstances render prospective relief
inappropriate. The District Court granted the 2002 injunction based
solely on its conclusion that the presence of the cross on federal land
conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of religion, and
the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the same grounds. Neither court considered
Robson

1053

The First Amendment

whether the Government had acted based on an improper purpose.
Given this sole reliance on perception, any further relief grounded on the
injunction should have rested on the same basis. But the District Court
used an injunction granted for one reason (perceived governmental
endorsement) as the basis for enjoining con- duct that was alleged to be
objectionable for a different reason (an illicit governmental purpose).
Ordering relief under such circumstances was improper. The court failed
to consider whether the change in law and circumstances effected by the
land-transfer statute had rendered the “reasonable observer” standard
inappropriate to resolve the dispute. Nor did the court attempt to
reassess Buono I’s findings in light of the accommodation policy
embraced by Congress. Rather, it concentrated solely on the religious
aspects of the cross, divorced from its background and context. The
same respect for a coordinate branch of Government that forbids striking
down an Act of Congress except upon a clear showing of
unconstitutionality, requires that a congressional command be given
effect unless no legal alternative exists. Even if, contrary to the
congressional judgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient
accommodation in light of the earlier endorsement finding, it was
incumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than
complete invalidation of the statute. On remand, that court should
conduct a proper inquiry into the continued necessity for injunctive relief
in light of the statute.
Concurring, Justice Alito concluded that this case should not be
remanded for the lower courts to decide whether implementation of the
land-transfer statute would violate the District Court’s injunction or the
Establishment Clause. Rather, because the factual record has been
sufficiently developed to permit resolution of these questions, he would
decide them and hold that the statute may be implemented. The case’s
singular circumstances presented Congress with a delicate problem. Its
solution was an approach designed to eliminate any perception of
religious sponsorship stemming from the location of the cross on
federally owned land, while avoiding the disturbing symbolism that some
would associate with the destruction of this historic monument. The
mechanism Congress selected is quite common in the West, a “land
exchange,” whereby ownership of the land on which the cross is located
would be transferred to the VFW in exchange for another nearby parcel
of equal value. The land transfer would not violate the District Court
injunction, the obvious meaning of which was simply that the
Government could not allow the cross to remain on federal land. Nor
would the statute’s implementation constitute an endorsement of religion
in violation of the Establishment Clause. The so-called “endorsement test”
views a challenged religious display through the eyes of a hypothetical
reasonable observer aware of the history and all other pertinent facts
relating to the display. Here, therefore, this observer would be familiar

Robson

1054

The First Amendment

with the monument’s origin and history and thereby appreciate that the
transfer represents an effort by Congress to address a unique situation
and to find a solution that best accommodates conflicting concerns.
Finally, the statute was not enacted for the illicit purpose of embracing
the monument’s religious message but to commemorate the Nation’s war
dead and to avoid the disturbing symbolism that would have been
created by the monument’s destruction.
Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concluded that this Court need
not—indeed, cannot—decide this case’s merits because Buono lacks
Article III standing to pursue the relief he seeks, which is not
enforcement of the original injunction but expansion of it. By enjoining
the Government from implementing the statute at issue, the District
Court’s 2005 order went well beyond the original injunction’s
proscription of the cross’s display on public property. Because Buono
seeks new relief, he must show that he has standing to pursue that relief
by demonstrating that blocking the land transfer will “redress or prevent
an actual or imminently threatened injury to [him] caused by private or
official violation of law.” He has failed, however, to allege any such injury.
Even assuming that being offended by a religious display constitutes a
cognizable injury, it is merely speculative whether the cross will remain
in place, and in any event Buono has made clear, by admitting he has no
objection to Christian symbols on private property, that he will not be
offended. Neither district courts’ discretion to expand injunctions they
have issued nor this District Court’s characterization of its 2005 order as
merely enforcing the existing injunction makes any difference. If in fact a
court awards new relief, it must have Article III jurisdiction to do so.
Justice Stevens, dissenting, joined by Sotomayor and Ginsberg,
concluded that the District Court was right to enforce its prior judgment
by enjoining Congress’ proposed remedy—a remedy that was engineered
to leave the cross intact and that did not alter its basic meaning. While
“the Nation should memorialize the service of those who fought and died
in World War I,” it “cannot lawfully do so by continued endorsement of a
starkly sectarian message” : “A Latin cross necessarily symbolizes one of
the most important tenets upon which believers in a benevolent Creator,
as well as nonbelievers, are known to differ.”
Justice Breyer, dissenting, concluded that the Establishment Clause
question was not properly before the Court. He stated that the only
question was whether the law permits the District Court to hold that the
land transfer (presumably along with the subsequent public display of
the cross) falls within the scope of its original injunctive order, an order
that says the Government must not “permi[t] the display of the Latin
cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.” For
Breyer, the District Court was correct, based “not in the Constitution but
in cases that concern the law of injunctions.”

III.	   The	  Problem	  of	  Establishment	  Clause	  Standing	  	  
As Salazar v. Buono illustrates, the problem of “standing” can be a
challenging one in Establishment Clause cases. Where is the “injury”? Is
it simply because one is a taxpayer and one’s money has been used to
support religion? In Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968), the Court
developed a test that liberalized - - - or seemed to liberalize - - - taxpayer
standing in Establishment Clause challenges.
The Court’s closely
divided and most recent decision on Establishment Clause standing,
regarding a tax subsidy to religious schools, seriously undermines Flast v.
Cohen.

563 U.S. ___ (2011)

KENNEDY, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH ROBERTS, C. J., AND SCALIA,
THOMAS, AND ALITO, JJ., JOINED. SCALIA, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION, IN WHICH THOMAS,
J., JOINED. KAGAN, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH GINSBURG, BREYER, AND
SOTOMAYOR, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Arizona provides tax credits for contributions to school tuition organizations, or
STOs. STOs use these contributions to provide scholarships to students
attending private schools, many of which are religious. Respondents are a
group of Arizona taxpayers who challenge the STO tax credit as a violation of
Establishment Clause principles under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
After the Arizona Supreme Court rejected a similar Establishment Clause claim
on the merits, respondents sought intervention from the Federal Judiciary.
To obtain a determination on the merits in federal court, parties seeking relief
must show that they have standing under Article III of the Constitution.
Standing in Establishment Clause cases may be shown in various ways. Some
plaintiffs may demonstrate standing based on the direct harm of what is
claimed to be an establishment of religion, such as a mandatory prayer in a
public school classroom. Other plaintiffs may demonstrate standing on the
ground that they have incurred a cost or been denied a benefit on account of
their religion. Those costs and benefits can result from alleged discrimination in
the tax code, such as when the availability of a tax exemption is conditioned on
religious affiliation.
For their part, respondents contend that they have standing to challenge
Arizona's STO tax credit for one and only one reason: because they are Arizona
taxpayers. But the mere fact that a plaintiff is a taxpayer is not generally
deemed sufficient to establish standing in federal court. To overcome that rule,
respondents must rely on an exception created in Flast v. Cohen (1968). For the

Robson

1056

The First Amendment

reasons discussed below, respondents cannot take advantage of Flast's narrow
exception to the general rule against taxpayer standing. As a consequence,
respondents lacked standing to commence this action, and their suit must be
dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
I
Respondents challenged §43-1089, a provision of the Arizona Tax Code. Section
43-1089 allows Arizona taxpayers to obtain dollar-for-dollar tax credits of up to
$500 per person and $1,000 per married couple for contributions to STOs. If
the credit exceeds an individual's tax liability, the credit's unused portion can
be carried forward up to five years. Under a version of §43-1089 in effect during
the pendency of this lawsuit, a charitable organization could be deemed an STO
only upon certain conditions. The organization was required to be exempt from
federal taxation under §501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It could
not limit its scholarships to students attending only one school. And it had to
allocate "at least ninety per cent of its annual revenue for educational
scholarships or tuition grants" to children attending qualified schools. A
"qualified school," in turn, was defined in part as a private school in Arizona
that did not discriminate on the basis of race, color, handicap, familial status,
or national origin.
In an earlier lawsuit filed in state court, Arizona taxpayers challenged §43-1089,
invoking both the United States Constitution and the Arizona Constitution. The
Arizona Supreme Court rejected the taxpayers' claims on the merits. This Court
denied certiorari.
The present action was filed in the United States District Court for the District
of Arizona. It named the Director of the Arizona Department of Revenue as
defendant. The Arizona taxpayers who brought the suit claimed that §43-1089
violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated
against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Respondents alleged that
§43-1089 allows STOs "to use State income-tax revenues to pay tuition for
students at religious schools," some of which "discriminate on the basis of
religion in selecting students." Respondents requested, among other forms of
relief, an injunction against the issuance of §43-1089 tax credits for
contributions to religious STOs. The District Court dismissed respondents' suit
as jurisdictionally barred by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. §1341. The Court
of Appeals reversed. This Court agreed with the Court of Appeals and affirmed.
Hibbs v. Winn (2004).
On remand, the Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization and other
interested parties intervened. The District Court once more dismissed
respondents' suit, this time for failure to state a claim. Once again, the Court of
Appeals reversed. It held that respondents had standing under Flast v. Cohen.
Reaching the merits, the Court of Appeals ruled that respondents had stated a
claim that §43-1089 violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
The full Court of Appeals denied en banc review, with eight judges dissenting.
This Court granted certiorari.
II
The concept and operation of the separation of powers in our National
Government have their principal foundation in the first three Articles of the

Robson

1057

The First Amendment

Constitution. Under Article III, the Federal Judiciary is vested with the "Power"
to resolve not questions and issues but "Cases" or "Controversies." ***
III
To state a case or controversy under Article III, a plaintiff must establish
standing. Allen v. Wright (1984). The minimum constitutional requirements for
standing were explained in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife (1992).
"First, the plaintiff must have suffered an 'injury in fact'--an invasion of a
legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b)
'actual or imminent, not "conjectural" or "hypothetical.'" Second, there
must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct
complained of--the injury has to be 'fairly ... trace[able] to the challenged
action of the defendant, and not ... th[e] result [of] the independent
action of some third party not before the court.' Third, it must be 'likely,'
as opposed to merely 'speculative,' that the injury will be 'redressed by a
favorable decision.'"
In requiring a particular injury, the Court meant "that the injury must affect
the plaintiff in a personal and individual way." The question now before the
Court is whether respondents, the plaintiffs in the trial court, satisfy the
requisite elements of standing.
A
Respondents suggest that their status as Arizona taxpayers provides them with
standing to challenge the STO tax credit. Absent special circumstances,
however, standing cannot be based on a plaintiff's mere status as a taxpayer.
This Court has rejected the general proposition that an individual who has paid
taxes has a "continuing, legally cognizable interest in ensuring that those funds
are not used by the Government in a way that violates the Constitution." Hein v.
Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc. (2007) (plurality opinion). This precept
has been referred to as the rule against taxpayer standing.
The doctrinal basis for the rule was discussed in Frothingham v. Mellon (1923)
(decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon). There, a taxpayer-plaintiff had alleged
that certain federal expenditures were in excess of congressional authority
under the Constitution. The plaintiff argued that she had standing to raise her
claim because she had an interest in the Government Treasury and because the
allegedly unconstitutional expenditure of Government funds would affect her
personal tax liability. The Court rejected those arguments. The "effect upon
future taxation, of any payment out of funds," was too "remote, fluctuating and
uncertain" to give rise to a case or controversy. And the taxpayer-plaintiff's
"interest in the moneys of the Treasury," the Court recognized, was necessarily
"shared with millions of others." As a consequence, Frothingham held that the
taxpayer-plaintiff had not presented a "judicial controversy" appropriate for
resolution in federal court but rather a "matter of public ... concern" that could
be pursued only through the political process.
In a second pertinent case, Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne (1952), the
Court considered Frothingham's prohibition on taxpayer standing in connection
with an alleged Establishment Clause violation. A New Jersey statute had
provided that public school teachers would read Bible verses to their students
at the start of each schoolday. A plaintiff sought to have the law enjoined,

Robson

1058

The First Amendment

asserting standing based on her status as a taxpayer. Writing for the Court,
Justice Jackson reiterated the foundational role that Article III standing plays
in our separation of powers. ***
It followed that the plaintiff's allegations did not give rise to a case or
controversy subject to judicial resolution under Article III. ***
Difficulties persist even if one assumes that an expenditure or tax benefit
depletes the government's coffers. ***
These well-established principles apply to the present cases. Respondents may
be right that Arizona's STO tax credits have an estimated annual value of over
$50 million. The education of its young people is, of course, one of the State's
principal missions and responsibilities; and the consequent costs will make up
a significant portion of the state budget. That, however, is just the beginning of
the analysis.
By helping students obtain scholarships to private schools, both religious and
secular, the STO program might relieve the burden placed on Arizona's public
schools. The result could be an immediate and permanent cost savings for the
State. Underscoring the potential financial benefits of the STO program, the
average value of an STO scholarship may be far less than the average cost of
educating an Arizona public school student. Because it encourages
scholarships for attendance at private schools, the STO tax credit may not
cause the State to incur any financial loss.
Even assuming the STO tax credit has an adverse effect on Arizona's annual
budget, problems would remain. ***
Each of the inferential steps to show causation and redressability depends on
premises as to which there remains considerable doubt. The taxpayers have not
shown that any interest they have in protecting the State Treasury would be
advanced. Even were they to show some closer link, that interest is still of a
general character, not particular to certain persons. Nor have the taxpayers
shown that higher taxes will result from the tuition credit scheme. The rule
against taxpayer standing, a rule designed both to avoid speculation and to
insist on particular injury, applies to respondents' lawsuit. The taxpayers, then,
must rely on an exception to the rule, an exception next to be considered.
B
The primary contention of respondents, of course, is that, despite the general
rule that taxpayers lack standing to object to expenditures alleged to be
unconstitutional, their suit falls within the exception established by Flast v.
Cohen. It must be noted at the outset that, as this Court has explained, Flast's
holding provides a "narrow exception" to "the general rule against taxpayer
standing." Bowen v. Kendrick (1988).
At issue in Flast was the standing of federal taxpayers to object, on First
Amendment grounds, to a congressional statute that allowed expenditures of
federal funds from the General Treasury to support, among other programs,
"instruction in reading, arithmetic, and other subjects in religious schools, and
to purchase textbooks and other instructional materials for use in such
schools." Flast held that taxpayers have standing when two conditions are met.

Robson

1059

The First Amendment

The first condition is that there must be a "logical link" between the plaintiff's
taxpayer status "and the type of legislative enactment attacked." This condition
was not satisfied in Doremus because the statute challenged in that case-providing for the recitation of Bible passages in public schools--involved at most
an "incidental expenditure of tax funds." In Flast, by contrast, the allegation
was that the Federal Government violated the Establishment Clause in the
exercise of its legislative authority both to collect and spend tax dollars. In the
decades since Flast, the Court has been careful to enforce this requirement. See
Hein, 551 U.S. 587 (no standing under Flast to challenge federal executive
actions funded by general appropriations); Valley Forge, 454 U.S. 464 (no
standing under Flast to challenge an agency's decision to transfer a parcel of
federal property pursuant to the Property Clause).
The second condition for standing under Flast is that there must be "a nexus"
between the plaintiff's taxpayer status and "the precise nature of the
constitutional infringement alleged." This condition was deemed satisfied in
Flast based on the allegation that Government funds had been spent on an
outlay for religion in contravention of the Establishment Clause. In Frothingham,
by contrast, the claim was that Congress had exceeded its constitutional
authority without regard to any specific prohibition. Confirming that Flast
turned on the unique features of Establishment Clause violations, this Court
has "declined to lower the taxpayer standing bar in suits alleging violations of
any constitutional provision apart from the Establishment Clause." Hein
(plurality opinion).
After stating the two conditions for taxpayer standing, Flast considered them
together, explaining that individuals suffer a particular injury for standing
purposes when, in violation of the Establishment Clause and by means of "the
taxing and spending power," their property is transferred through the
Government's Treasury to a sectarian entity. As Flast put it: "The taxpayer's
allegation in such cases would be that his tax money is being extracted and
spent in violation of specific constitutional protections against such abuses of
legislative power." Flast thus "understood the 'injury' alleged in Establishment
Clause challenges to federal spending to be the very 'extract[ion] and spen[ding]'
of 'tax money' in aid of religion alleged by a plaintiff." "Such an injury," Flast
continued, is unlike "generalized grievances about the conduct of government"
and so is "appropriate for judicial redress."
Flast found support for its finding of personal injury in "the history of the
Establishment Clause," particularly James Madison's Memorial and
Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments. In 1785, the General Assembly
of the Commonwealth of Virginia considered a "tax levy to support teachers of
the Christian religion." Under the proposed assessment bill, taxpayers would
direct their payments to Christian societies of their choosing. If a taxpayer
made no such choice, the General Assembly was to divert his funds to
"seminaries of learning," at least some of which "undoubtedly would have been
religious in character." Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995)
(Souter, J., dissenting). However the "seminaries" provision might have
functioned in practice, critics took the position that the proposed bill
threatened compulsory religious contributions.

Robson

1060

The First Amendment

In the Memorial and Remonstrance, Madison objected to the proposed
assessment on the ground that it would coerce a form of religious devotion in
violation of conscience. In Madison's view, government should not "'force a
citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one
establishment.'" Flast (quoting 2 Writings of James Madison). This Madisonian
prohibition does not depend on the amount of property conscripted for
sectarian ends. Any such taking, even one amounting to "three pence only,"
violates conscience. The proposed bill ultimately died in committee; and the
General Assembly instead enacted legislation forbidding "compelled" support of
religion. See A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 2 PAPERS OF
THOMAS JEFFERSON; see also Flast. Madison himself went on to become, as Flast
put it, "the leading architect of the religion clauses of the First Amendment."
Flast was thus informed by "the specific evils" identified in the public arguments
of "those who drafted the Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption."
Respondents contend that these principles demonstrate their standing to
challenge the STO tax credit. In their view the tax credit is, for Flast purposes,
best understood as a governmental expenditure. That is incorrect.
It is easy to see that tax credits and governmental expenditures can have
similar economic consequences, at least for beneficiaries whose tax liability is
sufficiently large to take full advantage of the credit. Yet tax credits and
governmental expenditures do not both implicate individual taxpayers in
sectarian activities. A dissenter whose tax dollars are "extracted and spent"
knows that he has in some small measure been made to contribute to an
establishment in violation of conscience. In that instance the taxpayer's direct
and particular connection with the establishment does not depend on economic
speculation or political conjecture. The connection would exist even if the
conscientious dissenter's tax liability were unaffected or reduced. When the
government declines to impose a tax, by contrast, there is no such connection
between dissenting taxpayer and alleged establishment. Any financial injury
remains speculative. And awarding some citizens a tax credit allows other
citizens to retain control over their own funds in accordance with their own
consciences.
The distinction between governmental expenditures and tax credits refutes
respondents' assertion of standing. When Arizona taxpayers choose to
contribute to STOs, they spend their own money, not money the State has
collected from respondents or from other taxpayers. Arizona's §43-1089 does
not "extrac[t] and spen[d]" a conscientious dissenter's funds in service of an
establishment, or "'force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property'"
to a sectarian organization. On the contrary, respondents and other Arizona
taxpayers remain free to pay their own tax bills, without contributing to an STO.
Respondents are likewise able to contribute to an STO of their choice, either
religious or secular. And respondents also have the option of contributing to
other charitable organizations, in which case respondents may become eligible
for a tax deduction or a different tax credit. The STO tax credit is not
tantamount to a religious tax or to a tithe and does not visit the injury
identified in Flast. It follows that respondents have neither alleged an injury for
standing purposes under general rules nor met the Flast exception. Finding
standing under these circumstances would be more than the extension of Flast

Robson

1061

The First Amendment

"to the limits of its logic." Hein (plurality opinion). It would be a departure from
Flast's stated rationale.
Furthermore, respondents cannot satisfy the requirements of causation and
redressability. When the government collects and spends taxpayer money,
governmental choices are responsible for the transfer of wealth. In that case a
resulting subsidy of religious activity is, for purposes of Flast, traceable to the
government's expenditures. And an injunction against those expenditures
would address the objections of conscience raised by taxpayer-plaintiffs. Here,
by contrast, contributions result from the decisions of private taxpayers
regarding their own funds. Private citizens create private STOs; STOs choose
beneficiary schools; and taxpayers then contribute to STOs. While the State, at
the outset, affords the opportunity to create and contribute to an STO, the tax
credit system is implemented by private action and with no state intervention.
Objecting taxpayers know that their fellow citizens, not the State, decide to
contribute and in fact make the contribution. These considerations prevent any
injury the objectors may suffer from being fairly traceable to the government.
And while an injunction against application of the tax credit most likely would
reduce contributions to STOs, that remedy would not affect noncontributing
taxpayers or their tax payments. As a result, any injury suffered by respondents
would not be remedied by an injunction limiting the tax credit's operation.
Resisting this conclusion, respondents suggest that Arizonans who benefit from
§43-1089 tax credits in effect are paying their state income tax to STOs. In
respondents' view, tax credits give rise to standing even if tax deductions do not,
since only the former yield a dollar-for-dollar reduction in final tax liability. But
what matters under Flast is whether sectarian STOs receive government funds
drawn from general tax revenues, so that moneys have been extracted from a
citizen and handed to a religious institution in violation of the citizen's
conscience. Under that inquiry, respondents' argument fails. Like contributions
that lead to charitable tax deductions, contributions yielding STO tax credits
are not owed to the State and, in fact, pass directly from taxpayers to private
organizations. Respondents' contrary position assumes that income should be
treated as if it were government property even if it has not come into the tax
collector's hands. That premise finds no basis in standing jurisprudence.
Private bank accounts cannot be equated with the Arizona State Treasury.
The conclusion that the Flast exception is inapplicable at first may seem in
tension with several earlier cases, all addressing Establishment Clause issues
and all decided after Flast. See Mueller; Nyquist v. Mauclet, (1977); Hunt v.
McNair (1973); Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York (1970). But those cases
do not mention standing and so are not contrary to the conclusion reached here.
When a potential jurisdictional defect is neither noted nor discussed in a federal
decision, the decision does not stand for the proposition that no defect existed.
The Court would risk error if it relied on assumptions that have gone unstated
and unexamined.
Furthermore, if a law or practice, including a tax credit, disadvantages a
particular religious group or a particular nonreligious group, the disadvantaged
party would not have to rely on Flast to obtain redress for a resulting injury.
Because standing in Establishment Clause cases can be shown in various ways,
it is far from clear that any nonbinding sub silentio holdings in the cases

Robson

1062

The First Amendment

respondents cite would have depended on Flast. See, e.g., Walz (explaining that
the plaintiff was an "owner of real estate" in New York City who objected to the
city's issuance of "property tax exemptions to religious organizations"). That the
plaintiffs in those cases could have advanced arguments for jurisdiction
independent of Flast makes it particularly inappropriate to determine whether
or why standing should have been found where the issue was left unexplored.
If an establishment of religion is alleged to cause real injury to particular
individuals, the federal courts may adjudicate the matter. Like other
constitutional provisions, the Establishment Clause acquires substance and
meaning when explained, elaborated, and enforced in the context of actual
disputes. That reality underlies the case-or-controversy requirement, a
requirement that has not been satisfied here.
Few exercises of the judicial power are more likely to undermine public
confidence in the neutrality and integrity of the Judiciary than one which casts
the Court in the role of a Council of Revision, conferring on itself the power to
invalidate laws at the behest of anyone who disagrees with them. In an era of
frequent litigation, class actions, sweeping injunctions with prospective effect,
and continuing jurisdiction to enforce judicial remedies, courts must be more
careful to insist on the formal rules of standing, not less so. Making the Article
III standing inquiry all the more necessary are the significant implications of
constitutional litigation, which can result in rules of wide applicability that are
beyond Congress' power to change.
The present suit serves as an illustration of these principles. The fact that
respondents are state taxpayers does not give them standing to challenge the
subsidies that §43-1089 allegedly provides to religious STOs. To alter the rules
of standing or weaken their requisite elements would be inconsistent with the
case-or-controversy limitation on federal jurisdiction imposed by Article III.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SCALIA, WITH WHOM JUSTICE THOMAS JOINS, CONCURRING.
Taxpayers ordinarily do not have standing to challenge federal or state
expenditures that allegedly violate the Constitution. In Flast v. Cohen (1968), we
created a narrow exception for taxpayers raising Establishment Clause
challenges to government expenditures. Today's majority and dissent struggle
with whether respondents' challenge to the Arizona tuition tax credit falls
within that narrow exception. Under a principled reading of Article III, their
struggles are unnecessary. Flast is an anomaly in our jurisprudence,
irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal judicial power that our
opinions have established. I would repudiate that misguided decision and
enforce the Constitution. See Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.,
(2007) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).
I nevertheless join the Court's opinion because it finds respondents lack
standing by applying Flast rather than distinguishing it away on unprincipled
grounds.

Robson

The First Amendment

JUSTICE KAGAN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, AND JUSTICE
SOTOMAYOR JOIN, DISSENTING.
Since its inception, the Arizona private-school-tuition tax credit has cost the
State, by its own estimate, nearly $350 million in diverted tax revenue. The
Arizona taxpayers who instituted this suit (collectively, Plaintiffs) allege that the
use of these funds to subsidize school tuition organizations (STOs) breaches the
Establishment Clause's promise of religious neutrality. Many of these STOs, the
Plaintiffs claim, discriminate on the basis of a child's religion when awarding
scholarships.
For almost half a century, litigants like the Plaintiffs have obtained judicial
review of claims that the government has used its taxing and spending power in
violation of the Establishment Clause. Beginning in Flast v. Cohen (1968), and
continuing in case after case for over four decades, this Court and others have
exercised jurisdiction to decide taxpayer-initiated challenges not materially
different from this one. Not every suit has succeeded on the merits, or should
have. But every taxpayer-plaintiff has had her day in court to contest the
government's financing of religious activity.
Today, the Court breaks from this precedent by refusing to hear taxpayers'
claims that the government has unconstitutionally subsidized religion through
its tax system. These litigants lack standing, the majority holds, because the
funding of religion they challenge comes from a tax credit, rather than an
appropriation. A tax credit, the Court asserts, does not injure objecting
taxpayers, because it "does not extract and spend [their] funds in service of an
establishment."
This novel distinction in standing law between appropriations and tax
expenditures has as little basis in principle as it has in our precedent. Cash
grants and targeted tax breaks are means of accomplishing the same
government objective--to provide financial support to select individuals or
organizations. Taxpayers who oppose state aid of religion have equal reason to
protest whether that aid flows from the one form of subsidy or the other. Either
way, the government has financed the religious activity. And so either way,
taxpayers should be able to challenge the subsidy.
Still worse, the Court's arbitrary distinction threatens to eliminate all occasions
for a taxpayer to contest the government's monetary support of religion.
Precisely because appropriations and tax breaks can achieve identical
objectives, the government can easily substitute one for the other. Today's
opinion thus enables the government to end-run Flast's guarantee of access to
the Judiciary. From now on, the government need follow just one simple rule-subsidize through the tax system--to preclude taxpayer challenges to state
funding of religion.
And that result--the effective demise of taxpayer standing--will diminish the
Establishment Clause's force and meaning. Sometimes, no one other than
taxpayers has suffered the injury necessary to challenge government
sponsorship of religion. Today's holding therefore will prevent federal courts
from determining whether some subsidies to sectarian organizations comport

Robson

1064

The First Amendment

with our Constitution's guarantee of religious neutrality. Because I believe these
challenges warrant consideration on the merits, I respectfully dissent from the
Court's decision.
I
As the majority recounts, this Court has held that paying taxes usually does
not give an individual Article III standing to challenge government action.
Taxpayers cannot demonstrate the requisite injury because each person's
"interest in the moneys of the Treasury ... is comparatively minute and
indeterminable." Frothingham v. Mellon (1923). Given the size and complexity of
government budgets, it is a "fiction" to contend that an unlawful expenditure
causes an individual "any measurable economic harm." Hein v. Freedom From
Religion Foundation, Inc. (2007) (plurality opinion). Nor can taxpayers in the
ordinary case establish causation (i.e., that the disputed government measure
affects their tax burden) or redressability (i.e., that a judicial remedy would
result in tax reductions). On these points, all agree.
The disagreement concerns their relevance here. This case is not about the
general prohibition on taxpayer standing, and cannot be resolved on that basis.
This case is instead about the exception to the rule--the principle established
decades ago in Flast that taxpayers may challenge certain government actions
alleged to violate the Establishment Clause. The Plaintiffs have standing if their
suit meets Flast's requirements--and it does so under any fair reading of that
decision.
Taxpayers have standing, Flast held, when they allege that a statute enacted
pursuant to the legislature's taxing and spending power violates the
Establishment Clause. In this situation, the Court explained, a plaintiff can
establish a two-part nexus "between the [taxpayer] status asserted and the
claim sought to be adjudicated." First, by challenging legislative action taken
under the taxing and spending clause, the taxpayer shows "a logical link
between [her] status and the type of ... enactment attacked." Second, by
invoking the Establishment Clause--a specific limitation on the legislature's
taxing and spending power--the taxpayer demonstrates "a nexus between [her]
status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged."
Because of these connections, Flast held, taxpayers alleging that the
government is using tax proceeds to aid religion have "the necessary stake ... in
the outcome of the litigation to satisfy Article III." They are "proper and
appropriate part[ies]"--indeed, often the only possible parties--to seek judicial
enforcement of the Constitution's guarantee of religious neutrality.
That simple restatement of the Flast standard should be enough to establish
that the Plaintiffs have standing. They attack a provision of the Arizona tax code
that the legislature enacted pursuant to the State Constitution's taxing and
spending clause (Flast nexus, part 1). And they allege that this provision
violates the Establishment Clause (Flast nexus, part 2). By satisfying both of
Flast's conditions, the Plaintiffs have demonstrated their "stake as taxpayers" in
enforcing constitutional restraints on the provision of aid to STOs. Indeed, the
connection in this case between "the [taxpayer] status asserted and the claim
sought to be adjudicated," could not be any tighter: As noted when this Court
previously addressed a different issue in this lawsuit, the Plaintiffs invoke the
Establishment Clause to challenge "an integral part of the State's tax statute"

Robson

1065

The First Amendment

that "is reflected on state tax forms" and that "is part of the calculus necessary
to determine tax liability." Hibbs v. Winn (2004) (Winn I) (Kennedy, J.,
dissenting) (emphasis added). Finding standing here is merely a matter of
applying Flast. I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals' determination (not
questioned even by the eight judges who called for rehearing en banc on the
merits) that the Plaintiffs can pursue their claim in federal court.
II
The majority reaches a contrary decision by distinguishing between two
methods of financing religion: A taxpayer has standing to challenge state
subsidies to religion, the Court announces, when the mechanism used is an
appropriation, but not when the mechanism is a targeted tax break, otherwise
called a "tax expenditure."1 In the former case, but not in the latter, the Court
declares, the taxpayer suffers cognizable injury.
But this distinction finds no support in case law, and just as little in reason. In
the decades since Flast, no court--not one--has differentiated between
appropriations and tax expenditures in deciding whether litigants have
standing. Over and over again, courts (including this one) have faced
Establishment Clause challenges to tax credits, deductions, and exemptions;
over and over again, these courts have reached the merits of these claims. And
that is for a simple reason: Taxpayers experience the same injury for standing
purposes whether government subsidization of religion takes the form of a cash
grant or a tax measure. The only rationale the majority offers for its newfound
distinction--that grants, but not tax expenditures, somehow come from a
complaining taxpayer's own wallet--cannot bear the weight the Court places on
it. If Flast is still good law--and the majority today says nothing to the contrary-then the Plaintiffs should be able to pursue their claim on the merits.
A
Until today, this Court has never so much as hinted that litigants in the same
shoes as the Plaintiffs lack standing under Flast. To the contrary: We have faced
the identical situation five times--including in a prior incarnation of this very
case!--and we have five times resolved the suit without questioning the
plaintiffs' standing. Lower federal courts have followed our example and
handled the matter in the same way. I count 14 separate cases (involving 20
appellate and district courts) that adjudicated taxpayer challenges to tax
expenditures alleged to violate the Establishment Clause. I suspect I have
missed a few. I have not found any instance of a court dismissing such a claim
for lack of standing.
Consider the five cases in which this Court entertained suits filed by taxpayers
alleging that tax expenditures unlawfully subsidized religion. We first took up
such a challenge in Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York (1970), where we
upheld the constitutionality of a property tax exemption for religious
organizations. Next, in Hunt v. McNair (1973), we decided that the
Establishment Clause permitted a state agency to issue tax-exempt bonds to
sectarian institutions. The same day, in Committee for Public Ed. & Religious
Liberty v. Nyquist (1973), we struck down a state tax deduction for parents who
paid tuition at religious and other private schools. A decade later, in Mueller v.
Allen (1983), we considered, but this time rejected, a similar Establishment
Clause challenge to a state tax deduction for expenses incurred in attending

Robson

1066

The First Amendment

such schools. And most recently, we decided a preliminary issue in this very
case, ruling that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. §1341, posed no barrier to
the Plaintiffs' litigation of their Establishment Clause claim. See Winn I. The
Court in all five of these cases divided sharply on the merits of the disputes.
But in one respect, the Justices were unanimous: Not a single one thought to
question the litigants' standing.
The Solicitor General, participating here as amicus curiae, conceded at oral
argument that under the Federal Government's--and now the Court's--view of
taxpayer standing, each of these five cases should have been dismissed for lack
of jurisdiction.
"[The Court:] So if you are right, ... the Court was without authority to
decide Walz, Nyquist, Hunt, Mueller, [and] Hibbs [v. Winn,] this very case,
just a few years ago?....
[Solicitor General:] Right.... [M]y answer to you is yes.
[The Court:] I just want to make sure I heard your answer to the--you
said the answer is yes. In other words, you agree ... those cases were
wrongly decided.... [Y]ou would have said there would have been no
standing in those cases.
[Solicitor General:] No taxpayer standing."
Nor could the Solicitor General have answered differently. Each of these suits,
as described above, alleged that a state tax expenditure violated the
Establishment Clause. And each relied only on taxpayer standing as the basis
for federal-court review. The Court today speculates that "the plaintiffs in those
cases could have advanced arguments for jurisdiction independent of Flast."
But whatever could have been, in fact not one of them did so.
And the Court itself understood the basis of standing in these five cases. This
and every federal court has an independent obligation to consider standing,
even when the parties do not call it into question. To do anything else would
risk an unlawful exercise of judicial authority. And in these cases the Court had
an additional prompt: In several of them, amici, including the United States,
contested--or at least raised as a question--the plaintiffs' standing as taxpayers
to pursue their claims. The Court, moreover, was well aware at the time of the
issues presented by taxpayer standing. We decided three of the cases within a
year of elaborating the general bar on taxpayer suits, and the fourth just after
we held that bar applicable to a different kind of Establishment Clause claim,
see Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church
and State, Inc. (1982). Indeed, the decisions on their face reflect the Court's
recognition of what gave the plaintiffs standing; in each, we specifically
described the plaintiffs as taxpayers who challenged the use of the tax system
to fund religious activities. In short, we considered and decided all these cases
because we thought taxpayer standing existed.
The majority shrugs off these decisions because they did not discuss what was
taken as obvious. But we have previously stressed that the Court should not
"disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be
proper for over 40 years." Brown Shoe Co. v. United States (1962); see Bowen v.
Kendrick (1988) (finding standing partly because the Court, in deciding similar

Robson

1067

The First Amendment

cases, had "not questioned the standing of taxpayer plaintiffs to raise
Establishment Clause challenges"); Bank of United States v. Deveaux (1809)
(Marshall, C.J.) (prior decisions exercising but not discussing jurisdiction "have
much weight, as they show that [a jurisdictional flaw] neither occurred to the
bar or the bench"). And that principle has extra force here, because we have
relied on some of these decisions to support the Court's jurisdiction in other
cases. Pause on that for a moment: The very decisions the majority today so
easily dismisses are featured in our prior cases as exemplars of jurisdiction. ***
We called those cases "adjudications of great moment discerning no
[jurisdictional] barrier" and warned that they could not "be written off as
reflecting nothing more than unexamined custom or unthinking habit." Until
today, that is--when the majority does write off these adjudications and reaches
a result against all precedent.
B
Our taxpayer standing cases have declined to distinguish between
appropriations and tax expenditures for a simple reason: Here, as in many
contexts, the distinction is one in search of a difference. To begin to see why,
consider an example far afield from Flast and, indeed, from religion. Imagine
that the Federal Government decides it should pay hundreds of billions of
dollars to insolvent banks in the midst of a financial crisis. Suppose, too, that
many millions of taxpayers oppose this bailout on the ground (whether right or
wrong is immaterial) that it uses their hard-earned money to reward
irresponsible business behavior. In the face of this hostility, some Members of
Congress make the following proposal: Rather than give the money to banks via
appropriations, the Government will allow banks to subtract the exact same
amount from the tax bill they would otherwise have to pay to the U.S. Treasury.
Would this proposal calm the furor? Or would most taxpayers respond by
saying that a subsidy is a subsidy (or a bailout is a bailout), whether
accomplished by the one means or by the other? Surely the latter; indeed, we
would think the less of our countrymen if they failed to see through this cynical
proposal.
And what ordinary people would appreciate, this Court's case law also
recognizes--that targeted tax breaks are often "economically and functionally
indistinguishable from a direct monetary subsidy." Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va. (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring). Tax credits, deductions,
and exemptions provided to an individual or organization have "much the same
effect as a cash grant to the [recipient] of the amount of tax it would have to
pay" absent the tax break. ***
For just this reason, government budgeting rules routinely insist on calculation
of tax subsidies, in addition to appropriations. The President must provide
information on the estimated cost of tax expenditures in the budget he submits
to Congress each year. Similarly, congressional budget committees must report
to all Members on the level of tax expenditures in the federal budget. Many
States--including Arizona--likewise compute the impact of targeted tax breaks
on the public treasury, in recognition that these measures are just spending
under a different name. The Arizona Department of Revenue must issue an
annual report "detailing the approximate costs in lost revenue for all state tax
expenditures." The most recent report notes the significance of this accounting

Robson

1068

The First Amendment

in the budget process. It explains that "the fiscal impact of implementing"
targeted tax breaks, including the STO credit challenged here, is "similar to a
direct expenditure of state funds." ("A dollar is a dollar--both for the person who
receives it and the government that pays it, whether the dollar comes with a tax
credit label or a direct expenditure label").
And because these financing mechanisms result in the same bottom line,
taxpayers challenging them can allege the same harm. Our prior cases have
often recognized the cost that targeted tax breaks impose on taxpayers
generally. "When the Government grants exemptions or allows deductions" to
some, we have observed, "all taxpayers are affected; the very fact of the
exemption or deduction ... means that other taxpayers can be said to be
indirect and vicarious 'donors.'" Bob Jones Univ. v. United States (1983). ***
[T]he key is this: Whenever taxpayers have standing under Flast to challenge an
appropriation, they should also have standing to contest a tax expenditure.
Their access to the federal courts should not depend on which type of financial
subsidy the State has offered.
Consider some further examples of the point, but this time concerning state
funding of religion. Suppose a State desires to reward Jews--by, say, $500 per
year--for their religious devotion. Should the nature of taxpayers' concern vary
if the State allows Jews to claim the aid on their tax returns, in lieu of receiving
an annual stipend? Or assume a State wishes to subsidize the ownership of
crucifixes. It could purchase the religious symbols in bulk and distribute them
to all takers. Or it could mail a reimbursement check to any individual who
buys her own and submits a receipt for the purchase. Or it could authorize that
person to claim a tax credit equal to the price she paid. Now, really--do
taxpayers have less reason to complain if the State selects the last of these
three options? The Court today says they do, but that is wrong. The effect of
each form of subsidy is the same, on the public fisc and on those who
contribute to it. Regardless of which mechanism the State uses, taxpayers have
an identical stake in ensuring that the State's exercise of its taxing and
spending power complies with the Constitution.
Here, the mechanism Arizona has selected is a dollar-for-dollar tax credit to aid
school tuition organizations. Each year come April 15, the State tells Arizonans:
Either pay the full amount of your tax liability to the State, or subtract up to
$500 from your tax bill by contributing that sum to an STO. To claim the credit,
an individual makes a notation on her tax return and splits her tax payment
into two checks, one made out to the State and the other to the STO. As this
Court recognized in Winn I, the STO payment is therefore "costless" to the
individual; it comes out of what she otherwise would be legally obligated to pay
the State--hence, out of public resources. And STOs capitalize on this aspect of
the tax credit for all it is worth--which is quite a lot. To drum up support, STOs
highlight that "donations" are made not with an individual's own, but with other
people's--i.e., taxpayers'--money. One STO advertises that "[w]ith Arizona's
scholarship tax credit, you can send children to our community's [religious] day
schools and it won't cost you a dime!" Another urges potential donors to
"imagine giving [to charity] with someone else's money.... Stop Imagining,
thanks to Arizona tax laws you can!" And so Arizonans do just that: It is, after
all, good fun to spend other people's money. By the State's reckoning, from

Robson

The First Amendment

1998 to 2008 the credit cost Arizona almost $350 million in redirected tax
revenue.
The Plaintiffs contend that this expenditure violates the Establishment Clause.
If the legislature had appropriated these monies for STOs, the Plaintiffs would
have standing, beyond any dispute, to argue the merits of their claim in federal
court. But the Plaintiffs have no such recourse, the Court today holds, because
Arizona funds STOs through a tax credit rather than a cash grant. No less than
in the hypothetical examples offered above, here too form prevails over
substance, and differences that make no difference determine access to the
Judiciary. And the casualty is a historic and vital method of enforcing the
Constitution's guarantee of religious neutrality.
C
The majority offers just one reason to distinguish appropriations and tax
expenditures: A taxpayer experiences injury, the Court asserts, only when the
government "extracts and spends" her very own tax dollars to aid religion. In
other words, a taxpayer suffers legally cognizable harm if but only if her
particular tax dollars wind up in a religious organization's coffers. See also Tr.
of Oral Arg. 4 (Solicitor General proposing that the "key point" was: "If you
placed an electronic tag to track and monitor each cent that the [Plaintiffs] pay
in tax," none goes to religious STOs). And no taxpayer can make this showing,
the Court concludes, if the government subsidizes religion through tax credits,
deductions, or exemptions (rather than through appropriations).
The majority purports to rely on Flast to support this new "extraction"
requirement. It plucks the three words "extrac[t] and spen[d]" from the midst of
the Flast opinion, and suggests that they severely constrict the decision's scope.
And it notes that Flast partly relied on James Madison's famed argument in the
Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments: "'[T]he same
authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his
property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to
any other establishment in all cases whatsoever.'" And that is all the majority
can come up with.
But as indicated earlier, everything of import in Flast cuts against the majority's
position. Here is how Flast stated its holding: "[W]e hold that a taxpayer will
have standing consistent with Article III to invoke federal judicial power when
he alleges that congressional action under the taxing and spending clause is in
derogation of" the Establishment Clause. Nothing in that straightforward
sentence supports the idea that a taxpayer can challenge only legislative action
that disburses his particular contribution to the state treasury. And here is how
Flast primarily justified its holding: "[O]ne of the specific evils feared by those
who drafted the Establishment Clause and fought for its adoption was that the
taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion over another or
to support religion in general." That evil arises even if the specific dollars that
the government uses do not come from citizens who object to the preference.
Likewise, the two-part nexus test, which is the heart of Flast's doctrinal
analysis, contains no hint of an extraction requirement. And finally, James
Madison provides no comfort to today's majority. He referred to "three pence"
exactly because it was, even in 1785, a meaningless sum of money; then, as
today, the core injury of a religious establishment had naught to do with any

Robson

1070

The First Amendment

given individual's out-of-pocket loss. So the majority is left with nothing, save
for three words Flast used to describe the particular facts in that case: In not a
single non-trivial respect could the Flast Court recognize its handiwork in the
majority's depiction.
The injury to taxpayers that Flast perceived arose whenever the legislature used
its taxing-and-spending power to channel tax dollars to religious activities. In
that and subsequent cases (including the five in this Court involving tax
expenditures), a taxpayer pleaded the requisite harm by stating that public
resources were funding religion; the tracing of particular dollars (whether by the
Solicitor General's "electronic tag" or other means) did not enter into the
question. And for all the reasons already given, that standard is met regardless
whether the funding is provided via cash grant or tax expenditure. Taxpayers
pick up the cost of the subsidy in either form. So taxpayers have an interest in
preventing the use of either mechanism to infringe religious neutrality.
Indeed, the majority's new conception of injury is at odds not merely with Flast,
but also (if ironically) with our cases precluding taxpayer standing generally.
Today's majority insists that legislation challenged under the Establishment
Clause must "extrac[t] and spen[d] a conscientious dissenter's funds." But we
have rejected taxpayer standing in other contexts because each taxpayer's
share of treasury funds is "minute and indeterminable." Frothingham. No
taxpayer can point to an expenditure (by cash grant or otherwise) and say that
her own tax dollars are in the mix; in fact, they almost surely are not. "[I]t is,"
as we have noted, "a complete fiction to argue that an unconstitutional ...
expenditure causes an individual ... taxpayer any measurable economic harm."
Hein (plurality opinion). That is as true in Establishment Clause cases as in any
others. Taxpayers have standing in these cases despite their foreseeable failure
to show that the alleged constitutional violation involves their own tax dollars,
not because the State has used their particular funds.
And something still deeper is wrong with the majority's "extract and spend"
requirement: It does not measure what matters under the Establishment
Clause. Let us indulge the Court's fiction that a taxpayer's ".000000000001
penny" is somehow involved in an ordinary appropriation of public funds for
religious activity (thus supposedly distinguishing it from a tax expenditure).
Still, consider the following example: Imagine the Internal Revenue Service
places a checkbox on tax returns asking filers if they object to the government
using their taxes to aid religion. If the government keeps "yes" money separate
from "no" money and subsidizes religious activities only from the nonobjectors'
account, the majority's analysis suggests that no taxpayer would have standing
to allege a violation of the Establishment Clause. The funds used, after all,
would not have been "extracted from a citizen and handed to a religious
institution in violation of the citizen's conscience." But this Court has never
indicated that States may insulate subsidies to religious organizations from
legal challenge by eliciting the consent of some taxpayers. And the Court has of
course been right not to take this approach. Taxpayers incur the same harm,
and should have the same ability to bring suit, whether the government stores
tax funds in one bank account or two. None of the principles underlying the
Establishment Clause suggests otherwise.

Robson

1071

The First Amendment

James Madison, whom the Court again rightly labels "the leading architect of
the religion clauses," (quoting Flast), had something important to say about the
matter of "extraction." As the majority notes, Madison's Memorial and
Remonstrance criticized a tax levy proposed in Virginia to aid teachers of the
Christian religion. But Madison's passionate opposition to that proposal
informs this case in a manner different than the majority suggests. The Virginia
tax in fact would not have extracted any monies (not even "three pence") from
unwilling citizens, as the Court now requires. The plan allowed conscientious
objectors to opt out of subsidizing religion by contributing their assessment to
an alternative fund for the construction and maintenance of county schools.
See A Bill Establishing A Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion,
reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing (1947) (supplemental appendix to
dissent of Rutledge, J.); Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (Jan. 9,
1785), reprinted in 2 Writings of James Madison, at 102, 113. Indeed, the
Virginia Assessment was specifically "designed to avoid any charges of coercion
of dissenters to pay taxes to support religious teachings with which they
disagreed."
In this respect, the Virginia Assessment is just like the Arizona tax credit.
Although both funnel tax funds to religious organizations (and so saddle all
taxpayers with the cost), neither forces any given taxpayer to pay for the
subsidy out of her pocket. Madison thought that feature of the Assessment
insufficient to save it. By relying on the selfsame aspect of the Arizona scheme
to deny the Plaintiffs' claim of injury, the majority betrays Madison's vision.
III
Today's decision devastates taxpayer standing in Establishment Clause cases.
The government, after all, often uses tax expenditures to subsidize favored
persons and activities. Still more, the government almost always has this
option. Appropriations and tax subsidies are readily interchangeable; what is a
cash grant today can be a tax break tomorrow. The Court's opinion thus offers
a roadmap--more truly, just a one-step instruction--to any government that
wishes to insulate its financing of religious activity from legal challenge.
Structure the funding as a tax expenditure, and Flast will not stand in the way.
No taxpayer will have standing to object. However blatantly the government may
violate the Establishment Clause, taxpayers cannot gain access to the federal
courts.
And by ravaging Flast in this way, today's decision damages one of this Nation's
defining constitutional commitments. "Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion"--ten simple words that have stood for over 200
years as a foundation stone of American religious liberty. Ten words that this
Court has long understood, as James Madison did, to limit (though by no
means eliminate) the government's power to finance religious activity. The
Court's ruling today will not shield all state subsidies for religion from review;
as the Court notes, some persons alleging Establishment Clause violations have
suffered individualized injuries, and therefore have standing, independent of
their taxpayer status. But Flast arose because "the taxing and spending power
[may] be used to favor one religion over another or to support religion in
general," without causing particularized harm to discrete persons. It arose
because state sponsorship of religion sometimes harms individuals only (but

Robson

1072

The First Amendment

this "only" is no small matter) in their capacity as contributing members of our
national community. In those cases, the Flast Court thought, our Constitution's
guarantee of religious neutrality still should be enforced.
Because that judgment was right then, and remains right today, I respectfully
dissent.

Notes	  
1.
In Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, 551 U.S. 587 (2007),
a closely divided Court considered whether there was Article III standing
to challenge President George W. Bush’s executive orders creating a
White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives and
similar “offices” in other executive agencies. The plurality distinguished
Flast v. Cohen because it involved a Congressional act, while the FaithBased and Community Initiatives were the result of executive action.
2.
Together with Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002) in the previous
chapter, does Winn mean the end of Establishment Clause challenges to
public (taxpayer) support for religious schools?

98 U.S. 145 (1879)

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
[ERROR to the Supreme Court of the Territory of Utah.
This is an indictment found in the District Court for the third judicial district of
the Territory of Utah, charging George Reynolds with bigamy, in violation of sect.
5352 of the Revised Statutes, which, omitting its exceptions, is as follows:-'Every person having a husband or wife living, who marries another,
whether married or single, in a Territory, or other place over which the
United States have exclusive jurisdiction, is guilty of bigamy, and shall
be punished by a fine of not more than $500, and by imprisonment for a
term of not more than five years.']
***
5. As to the defence of religious belief or duty.
On the trial, the plaintiff in error, the accused, proved that at the time of his
alleged second marriage he was, and for many years before had been, a member
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, commonly called the
Mormon Church, and a believer in its doctrines; that it was an accepted
doctrine of that church 'that it was the duty of male members of said church,
circumstances permitting, to practise polygamy ; . . . that this duty was
enjoined by different books which the members of said church believed to be of
divine origin, and among others the Holy Bible, and also that the members of
the church believed that the practice of polygamy was directly enjoined upon
the male members thereof by the Almighty God, in a revelation to Joseph Smith,
the founder and prophet of said church; that the failing or refusing to practise
polygamy by such male members of said church, when circumstances would
admit, would be punished, and that the penalty for such failure and refusal
would be damnation in the life to come.' He also proved 'that he had received
permission from the recognized authorities in said church to enter into
polygamous marriage; . . . that Daniel H. Wells, one having authority in said
church to perform the marriage ceremony, married the said defendant on or
about the time the crime is alleged to have been committed, to some woman by
the name of Schofield, and that such marriage ceremony was performed under
and pursuant to the doctrines of said church.'
Upon this proof he asked the court to instruct the jury that if they found from
the evidence that he 'was married as charged-if he was married-in pursuance of
and in conformity with what he believed at the time to be a religious duty, that
the verdict must be 'not guilty." This request was refused, and the court did
charge 'that there must have been a criminal intent, but that if the defendant,
under the influence of a religious belief that it was right,-under an inspiration,
if you please, that it was right,-deliberately married a second time, having a first
wife living, the want of consciousness of evil intent-the want of understanding

Robson

1075

The First Amendment

on his part that he was committing a crime-did not excuse him; but the law
inexorably in such case implies the criminal intent.'
Upon this charge and refusal to charge the question is raised, whether religious
belief can be accepted as a justification of an overt act made criminal by the law
of the land. The inquiry is not as to the power of Congress to prescribe criminal
laws for the Territories, but as to the guilt of one who knowingly violates a law
which has been properly enacted, if he entertains a religious belief that the law
is wrong.
Congress cannot pass a law for the government of the Territories which shall
prohibit the free exercise of religion. The first amendment to the Constitution
expressly forbids such legislation. Religious freedom is guaranteed everywhere
throughout the United States, so far as congressional interference is concerned.
The question to be determined is, whether the law now under consideration
comes within this prohibition.
The word 'religion' is not defined in the Constitution. We must go elsewhere,
therefore, to ascertain its meaning, and nowhere more appropriately, we think,
than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted.
The precise point of the inquiry is, what is the religious freedom which has been
guaranteed.
Before the adoption of the Constitution, attempts were made in some of the
colonies and States to legislate not only in respect to the establishment of
religion, but in respect to its doctrines and precepts as well. The people were
taxed, against their will, for the support of religion, and sometimes for the
support of particular sects to whose tenets they could not and did not subscribe.
Punishments were prescribed for a failure to attend upon public worship, and
sometimes for entertaining heretical opinions. The controversy upon this
general subject was animated in many of the States, but seemed at last to
culminate in Virginia. In 1784, the House of Delegates of that State having
under consideration 'a bill establishing provision for teachers of the Christian
religion,' postponed it until the next session, and directed that the bill should
be published and distributed, and that the people be requested 'to signify their
opinion respecting the adoption of such a bill at the next session of assembly.'
This brought out a determined opposition. Amongst others, Mr. Madison
prepared a 'Memorial and Remonstrance,' which was widely circulated and
signed, and in which he demonstrated 'that religion, or the duty we owe the
Creator,' was not within the cognizance of civil government. At the next session
the proposed bill was not only defeated, but another, 'for establishing religious
freedom,' drafted by Mr. Jefferson, was passed. In the preamble of this act
religious freedom is defined; and after a recital 'that to suffer the civil
magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the
profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency, is a
dangerous fallacy which at once destroys all religious liberty,' it is declared 'that
it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to
interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good
order.' In these two sentences is found the true distinction between what
properly belongs to the church and what to the State.

Robson

1076

The First Amendment

In a little more than a year after the passage of this statute the convention met
which prepared the Constitution of the United States.' Of this convention Mr.
Jefferson was not a member, he being then absent as minister to France. As
soon as he saw the draft of the Constitution proposed for adoption, he, in a
letter to a friend, expressed his disappointment at the absence of an express
declaration insuring the freedom of religion, but was willing to accept it as it
was, trusting that the good sense and honest intentions of the people would
bring about the necessary alterations. Five of the States, while adopting the
Constitution, proposed amendments. Three-New Hampshire, New York, and
Virginia-included in one form or another a declaration of religious freedom in
the changes they desired to have made, as did also North Carolina, where the
convention at first declined to ratify the Constitution until the proposed
amendments were acted upon. Accordingly, at the first session of the first
Congress the amendment now under consideration was proposed with others
by Mr. Madison. It met the views of the advocates of religious freedom, and was
adopted. Mr. Jefferson afterwards, in reply to an address to him by a committee
of the Danbury Baptist Association, took occasion to say: 'Believing with you
that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God; that he
owes account to none other for his faith or his worship; that the legislative
powers of the government reach actions only, and not opinions,-I contemplate
with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared
that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of
religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of
separation between church and State. Adhering to this expression of the
supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with
sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore man
to all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his
social duties.' Coming as this does from an acknowledged leader of the
advocates of the measure, it may be accepted almost as an authoritative
declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured. Congress
was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion, but was left free to reach
actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order.
Polygamy has always been odious among the northern and western nations of
Europe, and, until the establishment of the Mormon Church, was almost
exclusively a feature of the life of Asiatic and of African people. At common law,
the second marriage was always void (2 Kent, Com. 79), and from the earliest
history of England polygamy has been treated as an offence against society.
After the establishment of the ecclesiastical courts, and until the time of James
I., it was punished through the instrumentality of those tribunals, not merely
because ecclesiastical rights had been violated, but because upon the
separation of the ecclesiastical courts from the civil the ecclesiastical were
supposed to be the most appropriate for the trial of matrimonial causes and
offences against the rights of marriage, just as they were for testamentary
causes and the settlement of the estates of deceased persons.
By the statute of 1 James I. (c. 11), the offence, if committed in England or
Wales, was made punishable in the civil courts, and the penalty was death. As
this statute was limited in its operation to England and Wales, it was at a very
early period re-enacted, generally with some modifications, in all the colonies.
In connection with the case we are now considering, it is a significant fact that

Robson

1077

The First Amendment

on the 8th of December, 1788, after the passage of the act establishing religious
freedom, and after the convention of Virginia had recommended as an
amendment to the Constitution of the United States the declaration in a bill of
rights that 'all men have an equal, natural, and unalienable right to the free
exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,' the legislature of
that State substantially enacted the statute of James I., death penalty included,
because, as recited in the preamble, 'it hath been doubted whether bigamy or
poligamy be punishable by the laws of this Commonwealth.' 12 Hening's Stat.
691. From that day to this we think it may safely be said there never has been a
time in any State of the Union when polygamy has not been an offence against
society, cognizable by the civil courts and punishable with more or less severity.
In the face of all this evidence, it is impossible to believe that the constitutional
guaranty of religious freedom was intended to prohibit legislation in respect to
this most important feature of social life. Marriage, while from its very nature a
sacred obligation, is nevertheless, in most civilized nations, a civil contract, and
usually regulated by law. Upon it society may be said to be built, and out of its
fruits spring social relations and social obligations and duties, with which
government is necessarily required to deal. In fact, according as monogamous
or polygamous marriages are allowed, do we find the principles on which the
government of the people, to a greater or less extent, rests. Professor Lieber
says, polygamy leads to the patriarchal principle, and which, when applied to
large communities, fetters the people in stationary despotism, while that
principle cannot long exist in connection with monogamy. Chancellor Kent
observes that this remark is equally striking and profound. 2 Kent, Com. 81,
note (e). An exceptional colony of polygamists under an exceptional leadership
may sometimes exist for a time without appearing to disturb the social
condition of the people who surround it; but there cannot be a doubt that,
unless restricted by some form of constitution, it is within the legitimate scope
of the power of every civil government to determine whether polygamy or
monogamy shall be the law of social life under its dominion.
In our opinion, the statute immediately under consideration is within the
legislative power of Congress. It is constitutional and valid as prescribing a rule
of action for all those residing in the Territories, and in places over which the
United States have exclusive control. This being so, the only question which
remains is, whether those who make polygamy a part of their religion are
excepted from the operation of the statute. If they are, then those who do not
make polygamy a part of their religious belief may be found guilty and punished,
while those who do, must be acquitted and go free. This would be introducing a
new element into criminal law. Laws are made for the government of actions,
and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they
may with practices. Suppose one believed that human sacrifices were a
necessary part of religious worship, would it be seriously contended that the
civil government under which he lived could not interfere to prevent a sacrifice?
Or if a wife religiously believed it was her duty to burn herself upon the funeral
pile of her dead husband, would it be beyond the power of the civil government
to prevent her carrying her belief into practice?
So here, as a law of the organization of society under the exclusive dominion of
the United States, it is provided that plural marriages shall not be allowed. Can
a man excuse his practices to the contrary because of his religious belief? To

Robson

1078

The First Amendment

permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior
to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto
himself. Government could exist only in name under such circumstances.
A criminal intent is generally an element of crime, but every man is presumed
to intend the necessary and legitimate consequences of what he knowingly does.
Here the accused knew he had been once married, and that his first wife was
living. He also knew that his second marriage was forbidden by law. When,
therefore, he married the second time, he is presumed to have intended to
break the law. And the breaking of the law is the crime. Every act necessary to
constitute the crime was knowingly done, and the crime was therefore
knowingly committed. Ignorance of a fact may sometimes be taken as evidence
of a want of criminal intent, but not ignorance of the law. The only defence of
the accused in this case is his belief that the law ought not to have been
enacted. It matters not that his belief was a part of his professed religion: it was
still belief, and belief only.
In Regina v. Wagstaff (10 Cox Crim. Cases, 531), the parents of a sick child,
who omitted to call in medical attendance because of their religious belief that
what they did for its cure would be effective, were held not to be guilty of
manslaughter, while it was said the contrary would have been the result if the
child had actually been starved to death by the parents, under the notion that it
was their religious duty to abstain from giving it food. But when the offence
consists of a positive act which is knowingly done, it would be dangerous to
hold that the offender might escape punishment because he religiously believed
the law which he had broken ought never to have been made. No case, we
believe, can be found that has gone so far.
6. As to that part of the charge which directed the attention of the jury to the
consequences of polygamy.
The passage complained of is as follows: 'I think it not improper, in the
discharge of your duties in this case, that you should consider what are to be
the consequences to the innocent victims of this delusion. As this contest goes
on, they multiply, and there are pure-minded women and there are innocent
children,-innocent in a sense even beyond the degree of the innocence of
childhood itself. These are to be the sufferers; and as jurors fail to do their duty,
and as these cases come up in the Territory of Utah, just so do these victims
multiply and spread themselves over the land.'
While every appeal by the court to the passions or the prejudices of a jury
should be promptly rebuked, and while it is the imperative duty of a reviewing
court to take care that wrong is not done in this way, we see no just cause for
complaint in this case. Congress, in 1862, saw fit to make bigamy a crime in
the Territories. This was done because of the evil consequences that were
supposed to flow from plural marriages. All the court did was to call the
attention of the jury to the peculiar character of the crime for which the
accused was on trial, and to remind them of the duty they had to perform.
There was no appeal to the passions, no instigation of prejudice. Upon the
showing made by the accused himself, he was guilty of a violation of the law
under which he had been indicted: and the effort of the court seems to have

Robson

1079

The First Amendment

been not to withdraw the minds of the jury from the issue to be tried, but to
bring them to it; not to make them partial, but to keep them impartial.
Upon a careful consideration of the whole case, we are satisfied that no error
was committed by the court below.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE FIELD, CONCURRING [OMITTED]

Note:	  The	  Polygamy	  Voting	  Cases	  
In Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U.S. 15 (1885), the Court, in an opinion by
Justice Matthews, unanimously upheld a conviction barring voting for
polygamists under a 1882 Congressional statute that provided:
That no polygamist, bigamist, or any person cohabiting with more than one
woman, and no woman cohabiting with any of the persons described as
aforesaid in this section, in any territory or other place over which the United
States have exclusive jurisdiction, shall be entitled to vote at any election held in
any such territory or other place, or be eligible for election or appointment to or
to be entitled to hold any office or place of public trust, honor, or emolument, in,
under, or for any such territory or place, or under the United States.

The Court stated that
Certainly no legislation can be supposed more wholesome and necessary
in the founding of a free, self-governing commonwealth, fit to take rank
as one of the co-ordinate states of the Union, than that which seeks to
establish it on the basis of the idea of the family, as consisting in and
springing from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy
estate of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in
our civilization; the best guaranty of that reverent morality which is the
source of all beneficent progress in social and political improvement. And
to this end no means are more directly and immediately suitable than
those provided by this act, which endeavors to withdraw all political
influence from those who are practically hostile to its attainment.’ It is
assumed by counsel of the petitioner that, because no mode of worship
can be established, or religious tenets enforced, in this country, therefore
any form of worship may be followed, and any tenets, however
destructive of society, may be held and advocated, if asserted to be a part
of the religious doctrines of those advocating and practicing them. But
nothing is further from the truth. While legislation for the establishment
of a religion is forbidden, and its free exercise permitted, it does not
follow that everything which may be so called can be tolerated. Crime is
not the less odious because sanctioned by what any particular sect may
designate as ‘religion.’

Relying on Murphy v. Ramsey and Reynolds v. United States shortly
thereafter, the United States Supreme Court upheld a prohibition of

Robson

1080

The First Amendment

voting by believers in polygamy in Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333 (1890).
Davis involved a requirement in the territory of Idaho that required
persons wishing vote take the following oath:
“I do swear (or affirm) that I am a male citizen of the United States, of the age of
twenty-one years, (or will be on the 6th day of November, 1888;) that I have (or
will have) actually resided in this territory four months, and in this county for
thirty days, next preceding the day of the next ensuing election; that I have
never been convicted of treason, felony, or bribery; that I am not registered or
entitled to vote at any other place in this territory; and I do further swear that I
am not a bigamist or polygamist; that I am not a member of any order,
organization, or association which teaches, advises, counsels, or encourages its
members, devotees, or any other person, to commit the crime of bigamy or
polygamy, or any other crime defined by law, as a duty arising or resulting from
membership in such order, organization, or association, or which practices
bigamy, polygamy, or plural or celestial marriage as a doctrinal rite of such
organization; that I do not and will not, publicly or privately, or in any manner
whatever, teach, advise, counsel, or encourage any person to commit the crime
of bigamy or polygamy, or any other crime defined by law, either as a religious
duty or otherwise; that I do regard the constitution of the United States, and the
laws thereof, and the laws of this territory, as interpreted by the courts, as the
supreme laws of the land, the teachings of any order, organization, or
association to the contrary notwithstanding, so help me God.”
Samuel Davis, and others, were prosecuted under the statute because “in truth,
each of the defendants was a member of an order, organization, and association,
namely, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, commonly known as
the ‘Mormon Church,’ which they knew taught, advised, counseled, and
encouraged its members and devotees to commit the crimes of bigamy and
polygamy as duties arising and resulting from membership in said order,
organization, and association, and which order, organization, and association,
as they all knew, practiced bigamy and polygamy, and plural and celestial
marriage as doctrinal rites of said organization; and that, in pursuance of said
conspiracy, the said defendants went before the registrars of different precincts
of the county, (which are designated,) and took and had administered to them
respectively the oath aforesaid.”

Writing for a unanimous Court in Justice Field reasoned:
Bigamy and polygamy are crimes by the laws of all civilized and Christian
countries. They are crimes by the laws of the United States, and they are
crimes by the laws of Idaho. They tend to destroy the purity of the
marriage relation, to disturb the peace of families, to degrade woman,
and to debase man. Few crimes are more pernicious to the best interests
of society, and receive more general or more deserved punishment. To
extend exemption from punishment for such crimes would be to shock
the moral judgment of the community. To call their advocacy a tenet of
religion is to offend the common sense of mankind. If they are crimes,
then to teach, advise, and counsel their practice is to aid in their
commission, and such teaching and counseling are themselves criminal,
and proper subjects of punishment, as aiding and abetting crime are in
all other cases. The term ‘religion’ has reference to one's views of his
relations to his Creator, and to the obligations they impose of reverence
for his being and character, and of obedience to his will. It is often

Robson

1081

The First Amendment

confounded with the cultus or form of worship of a particular sect, but is
distinguishable from the latter. The first amendment to the constitution,
in declaring that congress shall make no law respecting the
establishment of religion or forbidding the free exercise thereof, was
intended to allow every one under the jurisdiction of the United States to
entertain such notions respecting his relations to his Maker and the
duties they impose as may be approved by his judgment and conscience,
and to exhibit his sentiments in such form of worship as he may think
proper, not injurious to the equal rights of others, and to prohibit
legislation for the support of any religious tenets, or the modes of
worship of any sect. The oppressive measures adopted, and the cruelties
and punishments inflicted, by the governments of Europe for many ages,
to compel parties to conform, in their religious beliefs and modes of
worship, to the views of the most numerous sect, and the folly of
attempting in that way to control the mental operations of persons, and
enforce an outward conformity to a prescribed standard, led to the
adoption of the amendment in question. It was never intended or
supposed that the amendment could be invoked as a protection against
legislation for the punishment of acts inimical to the peace, good order,
and morals of society. With man's relations to his Maker and the
obligations he may think they impose, and the manner in which an
expression shall be made by him of his belief on those subjects, no
interference can be permitted, provided always the laws of society,
designed to secure its peace and prosperity, and the morals of its people,
are not interfered with. However free the exercise of religion may be, it
must be subordinate to the criminal laws of the country, passed with
reference to actions regarded by general consent as properly the subjects
of punitive legislantion. There have been sects which denied as a part of
their religious tenets that there should be any marriage tie, and
advocated promiscuous intercourse of the sexes, as prompted by the
passions of its members. And history discloses the fact that the necessity
of human sacrifices, on special occasions, has been a tenet of many sects.
Should a sect of either of these kinds ever find its way into this country,
swift punishment would follow the carrying into effect of its doctrines,
and no heed would be given to the pretense that, as religious beliefs,
their supporters could be protected in their exercise by the constitution
of the United States. Probably never before in the history of this country
has it been seriously contended that the whole punitive power of the
government for acts, recognized by the general consent of the Christian
world in modern times as proper matters for prohibitory legislation, must
be suspended in order that the tenets of a religious sect encouraging
crime may be carried out without hindrance.

The remainder of the opinion discussed the power of the Territory of
Idaho to pass the criminal statute in question given that there was a
federal statute.
The note in Davis v. Beason discusses New York’s early “free exercise”
clause:

Robson

1082

The First Amendment

The constitutions of several states, in providing for religious freedom,
have declared expressly that such freedom shall not be construed to
excuse acts of licentiousness, or to justify practices inconsistent with the
peace and safety of the state Thus, the constitution of New York of 1777
provided as follows: ‘The free exercise and enjoyment of religious
profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall
forever hereafter be allowed, within this state, to all mankind: provided,
that the liberty of conscience hereby granted shall not be so construed as
to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the
peace or safety of this state.’ Article 38. The same declaration is repeated
in the constitution of 1821, (article 7, § 3,) and in that of 1846, (article 1,
§ 3,) except that for the words ‘hereby granted,’ the words ‘hereby
secured’ are substituted. The constitutions of California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, Nevada, and South Carolina contain a similar declaration.

Notes	  
What is the belief/practice dichotomy? Is it consistent with the
language of the First Amendment’s “Free Exercise” Clause? Is it
consistent with the Court’s decision in Davis v. Beason?
1.

The Court has disavowed some aspects of Davis v. Beason in
Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), finding Colorado’s Amendment 2
violated the Equal Protection Clause. Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the
Court stated:
2.

Davis v. Beason (1890), not cited by the parties but relied upon by the
[Justice Scalia’s] dissent, is not evidence that Amendment 2 is within our
constitutional tradition, and any reliance upon it as authority for
sustaining the amendment is misplaced. In Davis, the Court approved an
Idaho territorial statute denying Mormons, polygamists, and advocates of
polygamy the right to vote and to hold office because, as the Court
construed the statute, it “simply excludes from the privilege of voting, or
of holding any office of honor, trust or profit, those who have been
convicted of certain offences, and those who advocate a practical
resistance to the laws of the Territory and justify and approve the
commission of crimes forbidden by it.” To the extent Davis held that
persons advocating a certain practice may be denied the right to vote, it
is no longer good law. Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) (per curiam). To the
extent it held that the groups designated in the statute may be deprived
of the right to vote because of their status, its ruling could not stand
without surviving strict scrutiny, a most doubtful outcome. Dunn v.
Blumstein (1972). To the extent Davis held that a convicted felon may be
denied the right to vote, its holding is not implicated by our decision and
is unexceptionable. See Richardson v. Ramirez (1974).

Consider these two passages from Reynolds:

1083

The First Amendment

Polygamy has always been odious among the northern and western
nations of Europe, and, until the establishment of the Mormon Church,
was almost exclusively a feature of the life of Asiatic and of African
people.
[P]olygamy leads to the patriarchal principle, and which, when applied to
large communities, fetters the people in stationary despotism, while that
principle cannot long exist in connection with monogamy.

What is the Court implying?

Note:	  Fraud	  or	  Heresy?	  
In United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78 (1944), the Court considered
convictions for a scheme to defraud by organizing and promoting the “I
Am” movement through the use of the mails. The “I am” movement’s
tenets included the person of Guy W. Ballard, alias St. Germain, Jesus,
George Washington, and Godfre Ray King, as well as Edna W. Ballard
and Donald Ballard who had, by reason of super-natural attainments,
the power to heal persons of ailments and diseases and to make well
persons afflicted with any diseases, injuries, or ailments. The judge
instructed the jury:
The issue is: Did these defendants honestly and in good faith believe
those things? If they did, they should be acquitted. I cannot make it any
clearer than that.
If these defendants did not believe those things, they did not believe that
Jesus came down and dictated, or that Saint Germain came down and
dictated, did not believe the things that they wrote, the things that they
preached, but used the mail for the purpose of getting money, the jury
should find them guilty. Therefore, gentlemen, religion cannot come into
this case.

On appeal by the defendants, the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that it
was error to withhold the question of veracity of the beliefs from the jury.
The Court, in an opinion by Justice Douglas, reversed the Ninth Circuit,
stating
we do not agree that the truth or verity of respondents' religious
doctrines or beliefs should have been submitted to the jury. Whatever
this particular indictment might require, the First Amendment precludes
such a course, as the United States seems to concede. "The law knows
no heresy, and is committed to the support of no dogma, the
establishment of no sect." Watson v. Jones (1872). The First Amendment
has a dual aspect. It not only "forestalls compulsion by law of the
acceptance of any creed or the practice of any form of worship" but also
"safeguards the free exercise of the chosen form of religion." Cantwell v.
Connecticut (1940). "Thus the Amendment embraces two concepts, —
freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the
nature of things, the second cannot be." Freedom of thought, which

Robson

1084

The First Amendment

includes freedom of religious belief, is basic in a society of free men.
Board of Education v. Barnette (1943). It embraces the right to maintain
theories of life and of death and of the hereafter which are rank heresy to
followers of the orthodox faiths. Heresy trials are foreign to our
Constitution. Men may believe what they cannot prove. They may not be
put to the proof of their religious doctrines or beliefs. Religious
experiences which are as real as life to some may be incomprehensible to
others. Yet the fact that they may be beyond the ken of mortals does not
mean that they can be made suspect before the law. Many take their
gospel from the New Testament. But it would hardly be supposed that
they could be tried before a jury charged with the duty of determining
whether those teachings contained false representations. The miracles of
the New Testament, the Divinity of Christ, life after death, the power of
prayer are deep in the religious convictions of many. If one could be sent
to jail because a jury in a hostile environment found those teachings
false, little indeed would be left of religious freedom. The Fathers of the
Constitution were not unaware of the varied and extreme views of
religious sects, of the violence of disagreement among them, and of the
lack of any one religious creed on which all men would agree. They
fashioned a charter of government which envisaged the widest possible
toleration of conflicting views. Man's relation to his God was made no
concern of the state. He was granted the right to worship as he pleased
and to answer to no man for the verity of his religious views. The
religious views espoused by respondents might seem incredible, if not
preposterous, to most people. But if those doctrines are subject to trial
before a jury charged with finding their truth or falsity, then the same
can be done with the religious beliefs of any sect. When the triers of fact
undertake that task, they enter a forbidden domain. The First
Amendment does not select any one group or any one type of religion for
preferred treatment. It puts them all in that position.

There were two persuasive dissents reaching opposite conclusions from
each other.
Chief Justice Stone, joined by Justices Roberts and Frankfurter, would
have reinstated the guilty verdicts, rather than remand, and reasoned
that
I am not prepared to say that the constitutional guaranty of freedom of
religion affords immunity from criminal prosecution for the fraudulent
procurement of money by false statements as to one's religious
experiences, more than it renders polygamy or libel immune from
criminal prosecution. I cannot say that freedom of thought and worship
includes freedom to procure money by making knowingly false
statements about one's religious experiences.

Justice Jackson, dissenting, found a guilty verdict “difficult to reconcile
this conclusion with our traditional religious freedoms.”
In the first place, as a matter of either practice or philosophy I do not see
how we can separate an issue as to what is believed from considerations

Robson

1085

The First Amendment

as to what is believable. The most convincing proof that one believes his
statements is to show that they have been true in his experience.
Likewise, that one knowingly falsified is best proved by showing that
what he said happened never did happen. How can the Government
prove these persons knew something to be false which it cannot prove to
be false? If we try religious sincerity severed from religious verity, we
isolate the dispute from the very considerations which in common
experience provide its most reliable answer.
In the second place, any inquiry into intellectual honesty in religion
raises profound psychological problems. William James, who wrote on
these matters as a scientist, reminds us that it is not theology and
ceremonies which keep religion going. Its vitality is in the religious
experiences of many people. "If you ask what these experiences are, they
are conversations with the unseen, voices and visions, responses to
prayer, changes of heart, deliverances from fear, inflowings of help,
assurances of support, whenever certain persons set their own internal
attitude in certain appropriate ways." If religious liberty includes, as it
must, the right to communicate such experiences to others, it seems to
me an impossible task for juries to separate fancied ones from real ones,
dreams from happenings, and hallucinations from true clairvoyance.
Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but
none at all for another. They cannot be verified to the minds of those
whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight. When
one comes to trial which turns on any aspect of religious belief or
representation, unbelievers among his judges are likely not to
understand and are almost certain not to believe him.

JOINED.

JUSTICE BRENNAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Appellant, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, was discharged by
her South Carolina employer because she would not work on Saturday, the
Sabbath Day of her faith. When she was unable to obtain other employment
because from conscientious scruples she would not take Saturday work, she
filed a claim for unemployment compensation benefits under the South
Carolina Unemployment Compensation Act. That law provides that, to be

Robson

1086

The First Amendment

eligible for benefits, a claimant must be "able to work and . . . available for
work"; and, further, that a claimant is ineligible for benefits "[i]f. . . he has failed,
without good cause . . . to accept available suitable work when offered him by
the employment office or the employer . . . ." The appellee Employment Security
Commission, in administrative proceedings under the statute, found that
appellant's restriction upon her availability for Saturday work brought her
within the provision disqualifying for benefits insured workers who fail, without
good cause, to accept "suitable work when offered. . . by the employment office
or the employer . . ." The Commission's finding was sustained by the Court of
Common Pleas for Spartanburg County. That court's judgment was in turn
affirmed by the South Carolina Supreme Court, which rejected appellant's
contention that, as applied to her, the disqualifying provisions of the South
Carolina statute abridged her right to the free exercise of her religion secured
under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment through the Fourteenth
Amendment. The State Supreme Court held specifically that appellant's
ineligibility infringed no constitutional liberties because such a construction of
the statute "places no restriction upon the appellant's freedom of religion nor
does it in any way prevent her in the exercise of her right and freedom to
observe her religious beliefs in accordance with the dictates of her conscience."
We noted probable jurisdiction of appellant's appeal. We reverse the judgment
of the South Carolina Supreme Court and remand for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
I.
The door of the Free Exercise Clause stands tightly closed against any
governmental regulation of religious beliefs as such, Cantwell v. Connecticut
Government may neither compel affirmation of a repugnant belief, Torcaso
v.Watkins, nor penalize or discriminate against individuals or groups because
they hold religious views abhorrent to the authorities, Fowler v. Rhode Island
nor employ the taxing power to inhibit the dissemination of particular religious
views, Murdock v. Pennsylvania. On the other hand, the Court has rejected
challenges under the Free Exercise Clause to governmental regulation of certain
overt acts prompted by religious beliefs or principles, for "even when the action
is in accord with one's religious convictions, [it] is not totally free from
legislative restrictions."Braunfeld v.Brown. The conduct or actions so regulated
have invariably posed some substantial threat to public safety, peace or order.
See, e. g., Reynolds v. United States; Jacobson v. Massachusetts; Prince v.
Massachusetts; Cleveland v. United States.
Plainly enough, appellant's conscientious objection to Saturday work
constitutes no conduct prompted by religious principles of a kind within the
reach of state legislation. If, therefore, the decision of the South Carolina
Supreme Court is to withstand appellant's constitutional challenge, it must be
either because her disqualification as a beneficiary represents no infringement
by the State of her constitutional rights of free exercise, or because any
incidental burden on the free exercise of appellant's religion may be justified by
a "compelling state interest in the regulation of a subject within the State's
constitutional power to regulate . . . ."
II.

Robson

1087

The First Amendment

We turn first to the question whether the disqualification for benefits imposes
any burden on the free exercise of appellant's religion. We think it is clear that
it does. In a sense the consequences of such a disqualification to religious
principles and practices may be only an indirect result of welfare legislation
within the State's general competence to enact; it is true that no criminal
sanctions directly compel appellant to work a six-day week. But this is only the
beginning, not the end, of ourinquiry. For "[i]f the purpose or effect of a law is to
impede the observance of one or all religions or is to discriminate invidiously
between religions, that law is constitutionally invalid even though the burden
may be characterized as being only indirect." Here not only is it apparent that
appellant's declared ineligibility for benefits derives solely from the practice of
her religion, but the pressure upon her to forego that practice is unmistakable.
The ruling forces her to choose between following the precepts of her religion
and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of
her religion in order to accept work, on the other hand. Governmental
imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise
of religion as would a fine imposed against appellant for her Saturday worship.
Nor may the South Carolina court's construction of the statute be saved from
constitutional infirmity on the ground that unemployment compensation
benefits are not appellant's "right" but merely a "privilege." It is too late in the
day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by
the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege.*** Likewise, to
condition the availability of benefits upon this appellant's willingness to violate
a cardinal principle of her religious faith effectively penalizes the free exercise of
her constitutional liberties.
Significantly South Carolina expressly saves the Sunday worshipper from
having to make the kind of choice which we here hold infringes the
Sabbatarian's religious liberty. When in times of "national emergency" the
textile plants are authorized by the State Commissioner of Labor to operate on
Sunday, "no employee shall be required to work on Sunday . . . who is
conscientiously opposed to Sunday work; and if any employee should refuse to
work on Sunday on account of conscientious . . . objections he or she shall not
jeopardize his or her seniority by such refusal or be discriminated against in
any other manner." S. C. Code, § 64-4. No question of the disqualification of a
Sunday worshipper for benefits is likely to arise, since we cannot suppose that
an employer will discharge him in violation of this statute. The
unconstitutionality of the disqualification of the Sabbatarian is thus
compounded by the religious discrimination which South Carolina's general
statutory scheme necessarily effects.
III.
We must next consider whether some compelling state interest enforced in the
eligibility provisions of the South Carolina statute justifies the substantial
infringement of appellant's First Amendment right. It is basic that no showing
merely of a rational relationship to some colorable state interest would suffice;
in this highly sensitive constitutional area, "[o]nly the gravest abuses,
endangering paramount interests, give occasion for permissible limitation." No
such abuse or danger has been advanced in the present case. The appellees
suggest no more than a possibility that the filing of fraudulent claims by

Robson

1088

The First Amendment

unscrupulous claimants feigning religious objections to Saturday work might
not only dilute the unemployment compensation fund but also hinder the
scheduling by employers of necessary Saturday work. But that possibility is not
apposite here because no such objection appears to have been made before the
South Carolina Supreme Court, and we are unwilling to assess the importance
of an asserted state interest without the views of the state court. Nor, if the
contention had been made below, would the record appear to sustain it; there is
no proof whatever to warrant such fears of malingering or deceit as those which
the respondents now advance. Even if consideration of such evidence is not
foreclosed by the prohibition against judicial inquiry into the truth or falsity of
religious beliefs, United States v. Ballard —a question as to which we intimate
no view since it is not before us—it is highly doubtful whether such evidence
would be sufficient to warrant a substantial infringement of religious liberties.
For even if the possibility of spurious claims did threaten to dilute the fund and
disrupt the scheduling of work, it would plainly be incumbent upon the
appellees to demonstrate that no alternative forms of regulation would combat
such abuses without infringing First Amendment rights.
In these respects, then, the state interest asserted in the present case is wholly
dissimilar to the interests which were found to justify the less direct burden
upon religious practices in Braunfeld v. Brown. The Court recognized that the
Sunday closing law which that decision sustained undoubtedly served "to make
the practice of [the Orthodox Jewish merchants'] . . . religious beliefs more
expensive.” But the statute was nevertheless saved by a countervailing factor
which finds no equivalent in the instant case—a strong state interest in
providing one uniform day of rest for all workers. That secular objective could
be achieved, the Court found, only by declaring Sunday to be that day of rest.
Requiring exemptions for Sabbatarians, while theoretically possible, appeared
to present an administrative problem of such magnitude, or to afford the
exempted class so great a competitive advantage, that such a requirement
would have rendered the entire statutory scheme unworkable. In the present
case no such justifications underlie the determination of the state court that
appellant's religion makes her ineligible to receive benefits.
IV.
In holding as we do, plainly we are not fostering the "establishment" of the
Seventh-day Adventist religion in South Carolina, for the extension of
unemployment benefits to Sabbatarians in common with Sunday worshippers
reflects nothing more than the governmental obligation of neutrality in the face
of religious differences, and does not represent that involvement of religious
with secular institutions which it is the object of the Establishment Clause to
forestall. Nor does the recognition of the appellant's right to unemployment
benefits under the state statute serve to abridge any other person's religious
liberties. Nor do we, by our decision today, declare the existence of a
constitutional right to unemployment benefits on the part of all persons whose
religious convictions are the cause of their unemployment. This is not a case in
which an employee's religious convictions serve to make him a nonproductive
member of society. Finally, nothing we say today constrains the States to adopt
any particular form or scheme of unemployment compensation. Our holding
today is only that South Carolina may not constitutionally apply the eligibility
provisions so as to constrain a worker to abandon his religious convictions

Robson

1089

The First Amendment

respecting the day of rest. This holding but reaffirms a principle that we
announced a decade and a half ago, namely that no State may "exclude
individual Catholics, Lutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists,
Non-believers, Presbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of their
faith, or lack of it, from receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation."
Everson v. Board of Education (1947).
In view of the result we have reached under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments' guarantee of free exercise of religion, we have no occasion to
consider appellant's claim that the denial of benefits also deprived her of the
equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court is reversed and the case is
remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE DOUGLAS, CONCURRING.
*** The result turns not on the degree of injury, which may indeed be
nonexistent by ordinary standards. The harm is the interference with the
individual's scruples or conscience —an important area of privacy which the
First Amendment fences off from government. The interference here is as plain
as it is in Soviet Russia, where a churchgoer is given a second-class citizenship,
resulting in harm though perhaps not in measurable damages.
This case is resolvable not in terms of what an individual can demand of
government, but solely in terms of what government may not do to an
individual in violation of his religious scruples. The fact that government cannot
exact from me a surrender of one iota of my religious scruples does not, of
course, mean that I can demand of government a sum of money, the better to
exercise them. For the Free Exercise Clause is written in terms of what the
government cannot do to the individual, not in terms of what the individual can
exact from the government.
Those considerations, however, are not relevant here. If appellant is otherwise
qualified for unemployment benefits, payments will be made to her not as a
Seventh-day Adventist, but as an unemployed worker. Conceivably these
payments will indirectly benefit her church, but no more so than does the
salary of any public employee. Thus, this case does not involve the problems of
direct or indirect state assistance to a religious organization —matters relevant
to the Establishment Clause, not in issue here.
JUSTICE STEWART, CONCURRING IN THE RESULT.
Although fully agreeing with the result which the Court reaches in this case, I
cannot join the Court's opinion. This case presents a double-barreled dilemma,
which in all candor I think the Court's opinion has not succeeded in papering
over. The dilemma ought to be resolved.
I.

Robson

1090

The First Amendment

*** Because the appellant refuses to accept available jobs which would require
her to work on Saturdays, South Carolina has declined to pay unemployment
compensation benefits to her. Her refusal to work on Saturdays is based on the
tenets of her religious faith. The Court says that South Carolina cannot under
these circumstances declare her to be not "available for work" within the
meaning of its statute because to do so would violate her constitutional right to
the free exercise of her religion.
Yet what this Court has said about the Establishment Clause must inevitably
lead to a diametrically opposite result. If the appellant's refusal to work on
Saturdays were based on indolence, or on a compulsive desire to watch the
Saturday television programs, no one would say that South Carolina could not
hold that she was not "available for work" within the meaning of its statute.
That being so, the Establishment Clause as construed by this Court not only
permits but affirmatively requires South Carolina equally to deny the appellant's
claim for unemployment compensation when her refusal to work on Saturdays
is based upon her religious creed. For, as said in Everson v. Board of Education,
the Establishment Clause bespeaks "a government . . . stripped of all power . . .
to support, or otherwise to assist any or all religions . . . ," and no State "can
pass laws which aid one religion . . . ." In Mr. Justice Rutledge's words, *** the
Establishment Clause forbids "every form of public aid or support for religion."
In the words of the Court in Engel v. Vitale, the Establishment Clause forbids
the "financial support of government" to be "placed behind a particular religious
belief."
To require South Carolina to so administer its laws as to pay public money to
the appellant under the circumstances of this case is thus clearly to require the
State to violate the Establishment Clause as construed by this Court. This
poses no problem for me, because I think the Court's mechanistic concept of
the Establishment Clause is historically unsound and constitutionally wrong. I
think the process of constitutional decision in the area of the relationships
between government and religion demands considerably more than the
invocation of broad brushed rhetoric of the kind I have quoted. And I think that
the guarantee of religious liberty embodied in the Free Exercise Clause
affirmatively requires government to create an atmosphere of hospitality and
accommodation to individual belief or disbelief. In short, I think our
Constitution commands the positive protection by government of religious
freedom—not only for a minority, however small—not only for the majority,
however large—but for each of us.
South Carolina would deny unemployment benefits to a mother unavailable for
work on Saturdays because she was unable to get a babysitter. Thus, we do not
have before us a situation where a State provides unemployment compensation
generally, and singles out for disqualification only those persons who are
unavailable for work on religious grounds. This is not, in short, a scheme which
operates so as to discriminate against religion as such. But the Court
nevertheless holds that the State must prefer a religious over a secular ground
for being unavailable for work—that state financial support of the appellant's
religion is constitutionally required to carry out "the governmental obligation of
neutrality in the face of religious differences. . . ."

Yet in cases decided under the Establishment Clause the Court has decreed
otherwise. ***
JUSTICE HARLAN, WHOM JUSTICE WHITE JOINS, DISSENTING.
Today's decision is disturbing both in its rejection of existing precedent and in
its implications for the future. The significance of the decision can best be
understood after an examination of the state law applied in this case.
South Carolina's Unemployment Compensation Law was enacted in 1936 in
response to the grave social and economic problems that arose during the
depression of that period. ***
In the present case all that the state court has done is to apply these accepted
principles. Since virtually all of the mills in the Spartanburg area were
operating on a six-day week, the appellant was "unavailable for work," and thus
ineligible for benefits, when personal considerations prevented her from
accepting employment on a fulltime basis in the industry and locality in which
she had worked. The fact that these personal considerations sprang from her
religious convictions was wholly without relevance to the state court's
application of the law. Thus in no proper sense can it be said that the State
discriminated against the appellant on the basis of her religious beliefs or that
she was denied benefits because she was a Seventh-day Adventist. She was
denied benefits just as any other claimant would be denied benefits who was
not "available for work" for personal reasons.
With this background, this Court's decision comes into clearer focus. What the
Court is holding is that if the State chooses to condition unemployment
compensation on the applicant's availability for work, it is constitutionally
compelled to carve out an exception—and to provide benefits—for those whose
unavailability is due to their religious convictions. ***
[T]he implications of the present decision are far more troublesome than its
apparently narrow dimensions would indicate at first glance. The meaning of
today's holding, as already noted, is that the State must furnish unemployment
benefits to one who is unavailable for work if the unavailability stems from the
exercise of religious convictions. The State, in other words, must single out for
financial assistance those whose behavior is religiously motivated, even though
it denies such assistance to others whose identical behavior (in this case,
inability to work on Saturdays) is not religiously motivated.
*** I cannot subscribe to the conclusion that the State is constitutionally
compelled to carve out an exception to its general rule of eligibility in the
present case. Those situations in which the Constitution may require special
treatment on account of religion are, in my view, few and far between, and this
view is amply supported by the course of constitutional litigation in this area.
See, e. g., Braunfeld v. Brown; Cleveland v. United States; Prince v.
Massachusetts; Jacobson v. Massachusetts; Reynolds v. United States. Such
compulsion in the present case is particularly inappropriate in light of the
indirect, remote, and insubstantial effect of the decision below on the exercise
of appellant's religion and in light of the direct financial assistance to religion
that today's decision requires.

O'CONNOR, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH REHNQUIST, C.J., AND WHITE,
STEVENS, AND SCALIA, JJ., JOINED. BRENNAN, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH
MARSHALL AND BLACKMUN, JJ., JOINED. KENNEDY, J., TOOK NO PART IN THE CONSIDERATION OR
DECISION OF THE CASE.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
This case requires us to consider whether the First Amendment's Free Exercise
Clause prohibits the Government from permitting timber harvesting in, or
constructing a road through, a portion of a National Forest that has
traditionally been used for religious purposes by members of three American
Indian tribes in northwestern California. We conclude that it does not.
I
As part of a project to create a paved 75-mile road linking two California towns,
Gasquet and Orleans, the United States Forest Service has upgraded 49 miles
of previously unpaved roads on federal land. In order to complete this project
(the G-O road), the Forest Service must build a 6-mile paved segment through
the Chimney Rock section of the Six Rivers National Forest. That section of the
forest is situated between two other portions of the road that are already
complete.
In 1977, the Forest Service issued a draft environmental impact statement that
discussed proposals for upgrading an existing unpaved road that runs through
the Chimney Rock area. In response to comments on the draft statement, the
Forest Service commissioned a study of American Indian cultural and religious
sites in the area. The Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation adjoins the Six Rivers
National Forest, and the Chimney Rock area has historically been used for
religious purposes by Yurok, Karok, and Tolowa Indians. The commissioned
study, which was completed in 1979, found that the entire area "is significant
as an integral and indispensable part of Indian religious conceptualization and
practice." Specific sites are used for certain rituals, and successful use of the
[area] is dependent upon and facilitated by certain qualities of the physical
environment, the most important of which are privacy, silence, and an
undisturbed natural setting. The study concluded that constructing a road
along any of the available routes would cause serious and irreparable damage
to the sacred areas which are an integral and necessary part of the belief
systems and lifeway of Northwest California Indian peoples. Accordingly, the
report recommended that the G-O road not be completed.
In 1982, the Forest Service decided not to adopt this recommendation, and it
prepared a final environmental impact statement for construction of the road.
The Regional Forester selected a route that avoided archeological sites and was
removed as far as possible from the sites used by contemporary Indians for

Robson

1093

The First Amendment

specific spiritual activities. Alternative routes that would have avoided the
Chimney Rock area altogether were rejected because they would have required
the acquisition of private land, had serious soil stability problems, and would in
any event have traversed areas having ritualistic value to American Indians. At
about the same time, the Forest Service adopted a management plan allowing
for the harvesting of significant amounts of timber in this area of the forest. The
management plan provided for one-half mile protective zones around all the
religious sites identified in the report that had been commissioned in
connection with the G-O road.
After exhausting their administrative remedies, respondents -- an Indian
organization, individual Indians, nature organizations and individual members
of those organizations, and the State of California -- challenged both the
roadbuilding and timber harvesting decisions in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California. Respondents claimed that the
Forest Service's decisions violated the Free Exercise Clause, the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
(NEPA), several other federal statutes, and governmental trust responsibilities
to Indians living on the Hoopa Valley Reservation.
After a trial, the District Court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the
Government from constructing the Chimney Rock section of the G-O road or
putting the timber harvesting management plan into effect. The court found
that both actions would violate the Free Exercise Clause because they "would
seriously damage the salient visual, aural, and environmental qualities of the
high country." The court also found that both proposed actions would violate
the FWPCA, and that the environmental impact statements for construction of
the road were deficient under the NEPA. Finally, the court concluded that both
projects would breach the Government's trust responsibilities to protect water
and fishing rights reserved to the Hoopa Valley Indians.
While an appeal was pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit, Congress enacted the California Wilderness Act of 1984. Under
that statute, much of the property covered by the Forest Service's management
plan is now designated a wilderness area, which means that commercial
activities such as timber harvesting are forbidden. The statute exempts a
narrow strip of land, coinciding with the Forest Service's proposed route for the
remaining segment of the G-O road, from the wilderness designation. The
legislative history indicates that this exemption was adopted "to enable the
completion of the Gasquet-Orleans Road project if the responsible authorities so
decide." The existing unpaved section of road, however, lies within the
wilderness area, and is therefore now closed to general traffic.
A panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part. *** By a divided decision, the
District Court's constitutional ruling was also affirmed. Relying primarily on the
Forest Service's own commissioned study, the majority found that construction
of the Chimney Rock section of the G-O road would have significant, though
largely indirect, adverse effects on Indian religious practices. The majority
concluded that the Government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest
in the completion of the road, and that it could have abandoned the road
without thereby creating "a religious preserve for a single group in violation of
the establishment clause." The majority apparently applied the same analysis to

Robson

The First Amendment

logging operations that might be carried out in portions of the Chimney Rock
area not covered by the California Wilderness Act. ***
II
We begin by noting that the courts below did not articulate the bases of their
decisions with perfect clarity. A fundamental and longstanding principle of
judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in
advance of the necessity of deciding them, Ashwander v. TVA (1936) (Brandeis,
J., concurring). This principle required the courts below to determine, before
addressing the constitutional issue, whether a decision on that question could
have entitled respondents to relief beyond that to which they were entitled on
their statutory claims. If no additional relief would have been warranted, a
constitutional decision would have been unnecessary, and therefore
inappropriate. ***
Because it appears reasonably likely that the First Amendment issue was
necessary to the decisions below, we believe that it would be inadvisable to
vacate and remand without addressing that issue on the merits. This
conclusion is strengthened by considerations of judicial economy. The
Government, which petitioned for certiorari on the constitutional issue alone,
has informed us that it believes it can cure the statutory defects identified
below, intends to do so, and will not challenge the adverse statutory rulings. In
this circumstance, it is difficult to see what principle would be vindicated by
sending this case on what would almost certainly be a brief round trip to the
courts below.
III
A
The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment provides that "Congress shall
make no law . . . prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]." It is undisputed that
the Indian respondents' beliefs are sincere and that the Government's proposed
actions will have severe adverse effects on the practice of their religion. Those
respondents contend that the burden on their religious practices is heavy
enough to violate the Free Exercise Clause unless the Government can
demonstrate a compelling need to complete the G-O road or to engage in timber
harvesting in the Chimney Rock area. We disagree.
In Bowen v. Roy (1986), we considered a challenge to a federal statute that
required the States to use Social Security numbers in administering certain
welfare programs. Two applicants for benefits under these programs contended
that their religious beliefs prevented them from acceding to the use of a Social
Security number for their 2-year-old daughter because the use of a numerical
identifier would "‘rob the spirit' of [their] daughter and prevent her from
attaining greater spiritual power." Similarly, in this case, it is said that
disruption of the natural environment caused by the G-O road will diminish the
sacredness of the area in question and create distractions that will interfere
with training and ongoing religious experience of individuals using [sites within]
the area for personal medicine and growth . . . and as integrated parts of a
system of religious belief and practice which correlates ascending degrees of
personal power with a geographic hierarchy of power.
The Court rejected this kind of challenge in Roy:

Robson

1095

The First Amendment

The Free Exercise Clause simply cannot be understood to require the
Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with the
religious beliefs of particular citizens. Just as the Government may not insist
that [the Roys] engage in any set form of religious observance, so [they] may not
demand that the Government join in their chosen religious practices by
refraining from using a number to identify their daughter. . . .
. . . The Free Exercise Clause affords an individual protection from certain forms
of governmental compulsion; it does not afford an individual a right to dictate
the conduct of the Government's internal procedures.

The building of a road or the harvesting of timber on publicly owned land
cannot meaningfully be distinguished from the use of a Social Security number
in Roy. In both cases, the challenged Government action would interfere
significantly with private persons' ability to pursue spiritual fulfillment
according to their own religious beliefs. In neither case, however, would the
affected individuals be coerced by the Government's action into violating their
religious beliefs; nor would either governmental action penalize religious activity
by denying any person an equal share of the rights, benefits, and privileges
enjoyed by other citizens.
We are asked to distinguish this case from Roy on the ground that the
infringement on religious liberty here is "significantly greater," or on the ground
that the Government practice in Roy was "purely mechanical," whereas this
case involves "a case-by-case substantive determination as to how a particular
unit of land will be managed." Similarly, we are told that this case can be
distinguished from Roy because "the government action is not at some
physically removed location where it places no restriction on what a practitioner
may do." The State suggests that the Social Security number in Roy could be
characterized as interfering with Roy's religious tenets from a subjective point of
view, where the government's conduct of "its own internal affairs" was known to
him only second-hand, and did not interfere with his ability to practice his
religion.
In this case, however, it is said that the proposed road will "physically destro[y]
the environmental conditions and the privacy without which the [religious]
practices cannot be conducted."
These efforts to distinguish Roy are unavailing. This Court cannot determine
the truth of the underlying beliefs that led to the religious objections here or in
Roy, and accordingly cannot weigh the adverse effects on the appellees in Roy
and compare them with the adverse effects on the Indian respondents. Without
the ability to make such comparisons, we cannot say that the one form of
incidental interference with an individual's spiritual activities should be
subjected to a different constitutional analysis than the other.
Respondents insist, nonetheless, that the courts below properly relied on a
factual inquiry into the degree to which the Indians' spiritual practices would
become ineffectual if the G-O road were built. They rely on several cases in
which this Court has sustained free exercise challenges to government
programs that interfered with individuals' ability to practice their religion. See
Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972) (compulsory school-attendance law); Sherbert v.
Verner, (1963) (denial of unemployment benefits to applicant who refused to
accept work requiring her to violate the Sabbath); Thomas v. Review Board,

Robson

1096

The First Amendment

Indiana Employment Security Div. (1981) (denial of unemployment benefits to
applicant whose religion forbade him to fabricate weapons); Hobbie v.
Unemployment Appeals Comm’n of Florida (1987) (denial of unemployment
benefits to religious convert who resigned position that required her to work on
the Sabbath).
Even apart from the inconsistency between Roy and respondents' reading of
these cases, their interpretation will not withstand analysis. It is true that this
Court has repeatedly held that indirect coercion or penalties on the free exercise
of religion, not just outright prohibitions, are subject to scrutiny under the First
Amendment. Thus, for example, ineligibility for unemployment benefits, based
solely on a refusal to violate the Sabbath, has been analogized to a fine imposed
on Sabbath worship. This does not and cannot imply that incidental effects of
government programs, which may make it more difficult to practice certain
religions but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary
to their religious beliefs, require government to bring forward a compelling
justification for its otherwise lawful actions. The crucial word in the
constitutional text is "prohibit":
For the Free Exercise Clause is written in terms of what the government
cannot do to the individual, not in terms of what the individual can exact
from the government.
Sherbert (Douglas, J., concurring).
Whatever may be the exact line between unconstitutional prohibitions on the
free exercise of religion and the legitimate conduct by government of its own
affairs, the location of the line cannot depend on measuring the effects of a
governmental action on a religious objector's spiritual development. The
Government does not dispute, and we have no reason to doubt, that the logging
and roadbuilding projects at issue in this case could have devastating effects on
traditional Indian religious practices. Those practices are intimately and
inextricably bound up with the unique features of the Chimney Rock area,
which is known to the Indians as the "high country." Individual practitioners
use this area for personal spiritual development; some of their activities are
believed to be critically important in advancing the welfare of the Tribe, and
indeed, of mankind itself. The Indians use this area, as they have used it for a
very long time, to conduct a wide variety of specific rituals that aim to
accomplish their religious goals. According to their beliefs, the rituals would not
be efficacious if conducted at other sites than the ones traditionally used, and
too much disturbance of the area's natural state would clearly render any
meaningful continuation of traditional practices impossible. To be sure, the
Indians themselves were far from unanimous in opposing the G-O road, and it
seems less than certain that construction of the road will be so disruptive that
it will doom their religion. Nevertheless, we can assume that the threat to the
efficacy of at least some religious practices is extremely grave.
Even if we assume that we should accept the Ninth Circuit's prediction,
according to which the G-O road will "virtually destroy the . . . Indians' ability to
practice their religion,"(opinion below), the Constitution simply does not provide
a principle that could justify upholding respondents' legal claims. However
much we might wish that it were otherwise, government simply could not

Robson

1097

The First Amendment

operate if it were required to satisfy every citizen's religious needs and desires.
A broad range of government activities -- from social welfare programs to foreign
aid to conservation projects -- will always be considered essential to the
spiritual wellbeing of some citizens, often on the basis of sincerely held religious
beliefs. Others will find the very same activities deeply offensive, and perhaps
incompatible with their own search for spiritual fulfillment and with the tenets
of their religion. The First Amendment must apply to all citizens alike, and it
can give to none of them a veto over public programs that do not prohibit the
free exercise of religion. The Constitution does not, and courts cannot, offer to
reconcile the various competing demands on government, many of them rooted
in sincere religious belief, that inevitably arise in so diverse a society as ours.
That task, to the extent that it is feasible, is for the legislatures and other
institutions. Cf. The Federalist No. 10 (suggesting that the effects of religious
factionalism are best restrained through competition among a multiplicity of
religious sects).
One need not look far beyond the present case to see why the analysis in Roy,
but not respondents' proposed extension of Sherbert and its progeny, offers a
sound reading of the Constitution. Respondents attempt to stress the limits of
the religious servitude that they are now seeking to impose on the Chimney
Rock area of the Six Rivers National Forest. While defending an injunction
against logging operations and the construction of a road, they apparently do
not at present object to the area's being used by recreational visitors, other
Indians, or forest rangers. Nothing in the principle for which they contend,
however, would distinguish this case from another lawsuit in which they (or
similarly situated religious objectors) might seek to exclude all human activity
but their own from sacred areas of the public lands. *** No disrespect for these
practices is implied when one notes that such beliefs could easily require de
facto beneficial ownership of some rather spacious tracts of public property.
Even without anticipating future cases, the diminution of the Government's
property rights, and the concomitant subsidy of the Indian religion, would in
this case be far from trivial: the District Court's order permanently forbade
commercial timber harvesting, or the construction of a two-lane road, anywhere
within an area covering a full 27 sections (i.e. more than 17,000 acres) of public
land.
The Constitution does not permit government to discriminate against religions
that treat particular physical sites as sacred, and a law prohibiting the Indian
respondents from visiting the Chimney Rock area would raise a different set of
constitutional questions. Whatever rights the Indians may have to the use of
the area, however, those rights do not divest the Government of its right to use
what is, after all, its land.
B
Nothing in our opinion should be read to encourage governmental insensitivity
to the religious needs of any citizen. The Government's rights to the use of its
own land, for example, need not and should not discourage it from
accommodating religious practices like those engaged in by the Indian
respondents. It is worth emphasizing, therefore, that the Government has taken
numerous steps in this very case to minimize the impact that construction of
the G-O road will have on the Indians' religious activities. First, the Forest

Robson

1098

The First Amendment

Service commissioned a comprehensive study of the effects that the project
would have on the cultural and religious value of the Chimney Rock area. The
resulting 423-page report was so sympathetic to the Indians' interests that it
has constituted the principal piece of evidence relied on by respondents
throughout this litigation.
Although the Forest Service did not in the end adopt the report's
recommendation that the project be abandoned, many other ameliorative
measures were planned. No sites where specific rituals take place were to be
disturbed. In fact, a major factor in choosing among alternative routes for the
road was the relation of the various routes to religious sites: the route selected
by the Regional Forester is, he noted,
the farthest removed from contemporary spiritual sites; thus, the adverse
audible intrusions associated with the road would be less than all other
alternatives.
Nor were the Forest Service's concerns limited to "audible intrusions." As the
dissenting judge below observed, 10 specific steps were planned to reduce the
visual impact of the road on the surrounding country.
Except for abandoning its project entirely, and thereby leaving the two existing
segments of road to dead-end in the middle of a National Forest, it is difficult to
see how the Government could have been more solicitous. Such solicitude
accords with
the policy of the United States to protect and preserve for American
Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise
the traditional religions of the American Indian . . . including but not
limited to access to sites, use and possession of sacred objects, and the
freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites.
American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA), Pub.L. 95-341, 92 Stat. 469,42
U.S.C. §1996.
Respondents, however, suggest that AIRFA goes further, and in effect enacts
their interpretation of the First Amendment into statutory law. Although this
contention was rejected by the District Court, they seek to defend the judgment
below by arguing that AIRFA authorizes the injunction against completion of
the G-O road. This argument is without merit. After reciting several legislative
findings, AIRFA "resolves" upon the policy quoted above. A second section of the
statute, required an evaluation of federal policies and procedures, in
consultation with native religious leaders, of changes necessary to protect and
preserve the rights and practices in question. The required report dealing with
this evaluation was completed and released in 1979. Nowhere in the law is
there so much as a hint of any intent to create a cause of action or any
judicially enforceable individual rights.
What is obvious from the face of the statute is confirmed by numerous
indications in the legislative history. The sponsor of the bill that became AIRFA,
Representative Udall, called it "a sense of Congress joint resolution," aimed at
ensuring that
the basic right of the Indian people to exercise their traditional religious
practices is not infringed without a clear decision on the part of the
Robson

1099

The First Amendment

Congress or the administrators that such religious practices must yield
to some higher consideration.
Representative Udall emphasized that the bill would not "confer special
religious rights on Indians," would "not change any existing State or Federal
law," and in fact "has no teeth in it."

The decision of the court below, according to which the First Amendment
precludes the Government from completing the G-O road or from permitting
timber harvesting in the Chimney Rock area, is reversed. In order that the
District Court's injunction may be reconsidered in light of this holding, and in
the light of any other relevant events that may have intervened since the
injunction issued, the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KENNEDY TOOK NO PART IN THE CONSIDERATION OR DECISION OF THIS CASE.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE MARSHALL AND JUSTICE BLACKMUN JOIN,
DISSENTING.
"‘[T]he Free Exercise Clause,'" the Court explains today, "‘is written in terms of
what the government cannot do to the individual, not in terms of what the
individual can exact from the government.'" (quoting Sherbert v. Verner (1963)
(Douglas, J., concurring)). Pledging fidelity to this unremarkable constitutional
principle, the Court nevertheless concludes that, even where the Government
uses federal land in a manner that threatens the very existence of a Native
American religion, the Government is simply not "doing" anything to the
practitioners of that faith. Instead, the Court believes that Native Americans
who request that the Government refrain from destroying their religion
effectively seek to exact from the Government de facto beneficial ownership of
federal property. These two astonishing conclusions follow naturally from the
Court's determination that federal land use decisions that render the practice of
a given religion impossible do not burden that religion in a manner cognizable
under the Free Exercise Clause, because such decisions neither coerce conduct
inconsistent with religious belief nor penalize religious activity. The
constitutional guarantee we interpret today, however, draws no such fine
distinctions between types of restraints on religious exercise, but rather is
directed against any form of governmental action that frustrates or inhibits
religious practice. Because the Court today refuses even to acknowledge the
constitutional injury respondents will suffer, and because this refusal
essentially leaves Native Americans with absolutely no constitutional protection
against perhaps the gravest threat to their religious practices, I dissent.
I

Robson

1100

The First Amendment

For at least 200 years and probably much longer, the Yurok, Karok, and Tolowa
Indians have held sacred an approximately 25-square-mile area of land situated
in what is today the Blue Creek Unit of Six Rivers National Forest in
northwestern California. As the Government readily concedes, regular visits to
this area, known to respondent Indians as the "high country," have played and
continue to play a "critical" role in the religious practices and rituals of these
Tribes. Those beliefs, only briefly described in the Court's opinion, are crucial to
a proper understanding of respondents' claims.
As the Forest Service's commissioned study, the Theodoratus Report, explains,
for Native Americans religion is not a discrete sphere of activity separate from
all others, and any attempt to isolate the religious aspects of Indian life "is in
reality an exercise which forces Indian concepts into non-Indian categories." D.
Theodoratus, CULTURAL RESOURCES OF THE CHIMNEY ROCK SECTION, GASQUETORLEANS ROAD, SIX RIVERS NATIONAL FOREST (1979). Thus, for most Native
Americans, "[t]he area of worship cannot be delineated from social, political,
cultur[al], and other areas o[f] Indian lifestyle." American Indian Religious
Freedom, Hearings on S. J. Res. 102 before the Senate Select Committee on
Indian Affairs, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., 86 (1978) (statement of Barney Old Coyote,
Crow Tribe). A pervasive feature of this lifestyle is the individual's relationship
with the natural world; this relationship, which can accurately though
somewhat incompletely be characterized as one of stewardship, forms the core
of what might be called, for want of a better nomenclature, the Indian religious
experience. While traditional Western religions view creation as the work of a
deity "who institutes natural laws which then govern the operation of physical
nature," tribal religions regard creation as an ongoing process in which they are
morally and religiously obligated to participate. Native Americans fulfill this
duty through ceremonies and rituals designed to preserve and stabilize the
earth and to protect humankind from disease and other catastrophes. Failure
to conduct these ceremonies in the manner and place specified, adherents
believe, will result in great harm to the earth and to the people whose welfare
depends upon it.
In marked contrast to traditional Western religions, the belief systems of Native
Americans do not rely on doctrines, creeds, or dogmas. Established or universal
truths -- the mainstay of Western religions -- play no part in Indian faith.
Ceremonies are communal efforts undertaken for specific purposes in
accordance with instructions handed down from generation to generation.
Commentaries on or interpretations of the rituals themselves are deemed
absolute violations of the ceremonies, whose value lies not in their ability to
explain the natural world or to enlighten individual believers, but in their
efficacy as protectors and enhancers of tribal existence. Where dogma lies at the
heart of Western religions, Native American faith is inextricably bound to the
use of land. The site-specific nature of Indian religious practice derives from the
Native American perception that land is itself a sacred, living being. See Suagee,
American Indian Religious Freedom and Cultural Resources Management:
Protecting Mother Earth's Caretakers, 10 Am. Ind. L. Rev. 1, 10 (1982). Rituals
are performed in prescribed locations not merely as a matter of traditional
orthodoxy, but because land, like all other living things, is unique, and specific
sites possess different spiritual properties and significance. Within this belief
system, therefore, land is not fungible; indeed, at the time of the Spanish

Robson

1101

The First Amendment

colonization of the American Southwest, all . . . Indians held in some form a
belief in a sacred and indissoluble bond between themselves and the land in
which their settlements were located. E. Spicer, CYCLES OF CONQUEST: THE
IMPACT OF SPAIN, MEXICO, AND THE UNITED STATES ON THE INDIANS OF THE
SOUTHWEST, 1533-1960 (1962).
For respondent Indians, the most sacred of lands is the high country where,
they believe, prehuman spirits moved with the coming of humans to the Earth.
Because these spirits are seen as the source of religious power, or "medicine,"
many of the tribes' rituals and practices require frequent journeys to the area.
Thus, for example, religious leaders preparing for the complex of ceremonies
that underlie the Tribes' World Renewal efforts must travel to specific sites in
the high country in order to attain the medicine necessary for successful
renewal. Similarly, individual tribe members may seek curative powers for the
healing of the sick, or personal medicine for particular purposes such as good
luck in singing, hunting, or love. A period of preparation generally precedes
such visits, and individuals must select trails in the sacred area according to
the medicine they seek and their abilities, gradually moving to increasingly
more powerful sites, which are typically located at higher altitudes. Among the
most powerful of sites are Chimney Rock, Doctor Rock, and Peak 8, all of which
are elevated rock outcroppings.
According to the Theodoratus Report, the qualities "of silence, the aesthetic
perspective, and the physical attributes, are an extension of the sacredness of
[each] particular site." The act of medicine-making is akin to meditation: the
individual must integrate physical, mental, and vocal actions in order to
communicate with the prehuman spirits. As a result,
successful use of the high country is dependent upon and facilitated by certain
qualities of the physical environment, the most important of which are privacy,
silence, and an undisturbed natural setting.

Although few Tribe members actually make medicine at the most powerful sites,
the entire Tribe's welfare hinges on the success of the individual practitioners.
Beginning in 1972, the Forest Service began preparing a multiple-use
management plan for the Blue Creek Unit. *** Ultimately, however, the Service
settled on a route running along the Chimney Rock Corridor, which traverses
the Indians' sacred lands. ***
II
The Court does not for a moment suggest that the interests served by the G-O
road are in any way compelling, or that they outweigh the destructive effect
construction of the road will have on respondents' religious practices. Instead,
the Court embraces the Government's contention that its prerogative as
landowner should always take precedence over a claim that a particular use of
federal property infringes religious practices. Attempting to justify this rule, the
Court argues that the First Amendment bars only outright prohibitions, indirect
coercion, and penalties on the free exercise of religion. All other "incidental
effects of government programs," it concludes, even those which may make it
more difficult to practice certain religions but which have no tendency to coerce
individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs, simply do not give rise
to constitutional concerns. Since our recognition nearly half a century ago that

Clause, see Prince v. Massachusetts (1944), we have never suggested that the
protections of the guarantee are limited to so narrow a range of governmental
burdens. The land use decision challenged here will restrain respondents from
practicing their religion as surely and as completely as any of the governmental
actions we have struck down in the past, and the Court's efforts simply to
define away respondents' injury as nonconstitutional are both unjustified and
ultimately unpersuasive.
A
*** Here, respondents have demonstrated that the Government's proposed
activities will completely prevent them from practicing their religion, and such a
showing, no less than those made out in Hobbie, Thomas, Sherbert, and Yoder,
entitles them to the protections of the Free Exercise Clause.
B
Nor can I agree with the Court's assertion that respondents' constitutional
claim is foreclosed by our decision in Bowen v. Roy (1986). There, applicants for
certain welfare benefits objected to the use of a Social Security number in
connection with the administration of their 2-year-old daughter's application for
benefits, contending that such use would "rob the [child's] spirit," and thus
interfere with her spiritual development. *** When the Government processes
information, of course, it acts in a purely internal manner, and any free exercise
challenge to such internal recordkeeping in effect seeks to dictate how the
Government conducts its own affairs.
Federal land use decisions, by contrast, are likely to have substantial external
effects that government decisions concerning office furniture and information
storage obviously will not, and they are correspondingly subject to public
scrutiny and public challenge in a host of ways that office equipment purchases
are not. Indeed, in the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA)
Congress expressly recognized the adverse impact land use decisions and other
governmental actions frequently have on the site-specific religious practices of
Native Americans, and the Act accordingly directs agencies to consult with
Native American religious leaders before taking actions that might impair those
practices. Although I agree that the Act does not create any judicially
enforceable rights, the absence of any private right of action in no way
undermines the statute's significance as an express congressional
determination that federal land management decisions are not "internal"
Government "procedures," but are instead governmental actions that can and
indeed are likely to burden Native American religious practices. That such
decisions should be subject to constitutional challenge, and potential
constitutional limitations, should hardly come as a surprise.
The Court today, however, ignores Roy's emphasis on the internal nature of the
Government practice at issue there, and instead construes that case as further
support for the proposition that governmental action that does not coerce
conduct inconsistent with religious faith simply does not implicate the concerns
of the Free Exercise Clause. That such a reading is wholly untenable, however,
is demonstrated by the cruelly surreal result it produces here: governmental
action that will virtually destroy a religion is nevertheless deemed not to
"burden" that religion. ***

The First Amendment

C
In the final analysis, the Court's refusal to recognize the constitutional
dimension of respondents' injuries stems from its concern that acceptance of
respondents' claim could potentially strip the Government of its ability to
manage and use vast tracts of federal property. In addition, the nature of
respondents' site-specific religious practices raises the specter of future suits in
which Native Americans seek to exclude all human activity from such areas.
These concededly legitimate concerns lie at the very heart of this case, which
represents yet another stress point in the longstanding conflict between two
disparate cultures -- the dominant Western culture, which views land in terms
of ownership and use, and that of Native Americans, in which concepts of
private property are not only alien, but contrary to a belief system that holds
land sacred. Rather than address this conflict in any meaningful fashion,
however, the Court disclaims all responsibility for balancing these competing
and potentially irreconcilable interests, choosing instead to turn this difficult
task over to the Federal Legislature. Such an abdication is more than merely
indefensible as an institutional matter: by defining respondents' injury as
"nonconstitutional," the Court has effectively bestowed on one party to this
conflict the unilateral authority to resolve all future disputes in its favor,
subject only to the Court's toothless exhortation to be "sensitive" to affected
religions. In my view, however, Native Americans deserve -- and the
Constitution demands -- more than this. ***
III
Today, the Court holds that a federal land use decision that promises to destroy
an entire religion does not burden the practice of that faith in a manner
recognized by the Free Exercise Clause. ***
Having thus stripped respondents and all other Native Americans of any
constitutional protection against perhaps the most serious threat to their ageold religious practices, and indeed to their entire way of life, the Court assures
us that nothing in its decision "should be read to encourage governmental
insensitivity to the religious needs of any citizen.” *** Given today's ruling, that
freedom amounts to nothing more than the right to believe that their religion
will be destroyed. The safeguarding of such a hollow freedom not only makes a
mockery of the policy of the United States to protect and preserve for American
Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise the[ir]
traditional religions, it fails utterly to accord with the dictates of the First
Amendment. I dissent.

SCALIA, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH REHNQUIST, C. J., AND WHITE,
STEVENS, AND KENNEDY, JJ., JOINED. O'CONNOR, J., FILED AN OPINION CONCURRING IN THE
JUDGMENT, IN PARTS I AND II OF WHICH BRENNAN, MARSHALL, AND BLACKMUN, JJ., JOINED
WITHOUT CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT. BLACKMUN, J., FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH
BRENNAN AND MARSHALL, JJ., JOINED.

JUSTICE SCALIA DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
This case requires us to decide whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First
Amendment permits the State of Oregon to include religiously inspired peyote
use within the reach of its general criminal prohibition on use of that drug, and
thus permits the State to deny unemployment benefits to persons dismissed
from their jobs because of such religiously inspired use.
I
Oregon law prohibits the knowing or intentional possession of a "controlled
substance" unless the substance has been prescribed by a medical practitioner.
The law defines "controlled substance" as a drug classified in Schedules I
through V of the Federal Controlled Substances Act, as modified by the State
Board of Pharmacy. Ore.Rev.Stat. §475.005(6) (1987). Persons who violate this
provision by possessing a controlled substance listed on Schedule I are "guilty
of a Class B felony." As compiled by the State Board of Pharmacy under its
statutory authority, Schedule I contains the drug peyote, a hallucinogen derived
from the plant Lophophorawilliamsii Lemaire.
Respondents Alfred Smith and Galen Black were fired from their jobs with a
private drug rehabilitation organization because they ingested peyote for
sacramental purposes at a ceremony of the Native American Church, of which
both are members. When respondents applied to petitioner Employment
Division for unemployment compensation, they were determined to be ineligible
for benefits because they had been discharged for work-related "misconduct".
The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed that determination, holding that the
denial of benefits violated respondents' free exercise rights under the First
Amendment.
On appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court, petitioner argued that the denial of
benefits was permissible because respondents' consumption of peyote was a
crime under Oregon law. The Oregon Supreme Court reasoned, however, that
the criminality of respondents' peyote use was irrelevant to resolution of their
constitutional claim -- since the purpose of the "misconduct" provision under
which respondents had been disqualified was not to enforce the State's criminal
laws, but to preserve the financial integrity of the compensation fund, and since
that purpose was inadequate to justify the burden that disqualification imposed
on respondents' religious practice. Citing our decisions in Sherbert v. Verner
(1963) and Thomas v. Review Board, Indiana Employment Security Div. (1981),
the court concluded that respondents were entitled to payment of
unemployment benefits. We granted certiorari.

Robson

1105

The First Amendment

Before this Court in 1987, petitioner continued to maintain that the illegality of
respondents' peyote consumption was relevant to their constitutional claim. We
agreed, concluding that
if a State has prohibited through its criminal laws certain kinds of religiously
motivated conduct without violating the First Amendment, it certainly follows
that it may impose the lesser burden of denying unemployment compensation
benefits to persons who engage in that conduct.

Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith (1988) (Smith I).
We noted, however, that the Oregon Supreme Court had not decided whether
respondents' sacramental use of peyote was in fact proscribed by Oregon's
controlled substance law, and that this issue was a matter of dispute between
the parties. Being "uncertain about the legality of the religious use of peyote in
Oregon," we determined that it would not be "appropriate for us to decide
whether the practice is protected by the Federal Constitution." Accordingly, we
vacated the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court and remanded for further
proceedings.
On remand, the Oregon Supreme Court held that respondents' religiously
inspired use of peyote fell within the prohibition of the Oregon statute, which
"makes no exception for the sacramental use" of the drug. It then considered
whether that prohibition was valid under the Free Exercise Clause, and
concluded that it was not. The court therefore reaffirmed its previous ruling
that the State could not deny unemployment benefits to respondents for having
engaged in that practice.
We again granted certiorari.
II
Respondents' claim for relief rests on our decisions in Sherbert v. Verner;
Thomas v. Review Board, Indiana Employment Security Div; and Hobbie v.
Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Florida (1987), in which we held that a State
could not condition the availability of unemployment insurance on an
individual's willingness to forgo conduct required by his religion. As we
observed in Smith I, however, the conduct at issue in those cases was not
prohibited by law. We held that distinction to be critical, for if Oregon does
prohibit the religious use of peyote, and if that prohibition is consistent with the
Federal Constitution, there is no federal right to engage in that conduct in
Oregon, and the State is free to withhold unemployment compensation from
respondents for engaging in work-related misconduct, despite its religious
motivation. Now that the Oregon Supreme Court has confirmed that Oregon
does prohibit the religious use of peyote, we proceed to consider whether that
prohibition is permissible under the Free Exercise Clause.
A
The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which has been made
applicable to the States by incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment,
provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.. . . " U.S. Const. Am. I (emphasis
added). The free exercise of religion means, first and foremost, the right to
believe and profess whatever religious doctrine one desires. Thus, the First
Amendment obviously excludes all "governmental regulation of religious beliefs

Robson

1106

The First Amendment

as such." Sherbert v. Verner. The government may not compel affirmation of
religious belief, see Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), punish the expression of religious
doctrines it believes to be false, United States v. Ballard (1944), impose special
disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status or lend its power to
one or the other side in controversies over religious authority or dogma.
But the "exercise of religion" often involves not only belief and profession but
the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts: assembling with others
for a worship service, participating in sacramental use of bread and wine,
proselytizing, abstaining from certain foods or certain modes of transportation.
It would be true, we think (though no case of ours has involved the point), that
a state would be "prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]" if it sought to ban
such acts or abstentions only when they are engaged in for religious reasons, or
only because of the religious belief that they display. It would doubtless be
unconstitutional, for example, to ban the casting of "statues that are to be used
for worship purposes," or to prohibit bowing down before a golden calf.
Respondents in the present case, however, seek to carry the meaning of
"prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]" one large step further. They contend
that their religious motivation for using peyote places them beyond the reach of
a criminal law that is not specifically directed at their religious practice, and
that is concededly constitutional as applied to those who use the drug for other
reasons. They assert, in other words, that "prohibiting the free exercise [of
religion]" includes requiring any individual to observe a generally applicable law
that requires (or forbids) the performance of an act that his religious belief
forbids (or requires). As a textual matter, we do not think the words must be
given that meaning. It is no more necessary to regard the collection of a general
tax, for example, as "prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]" by those citizens
who believe support of organized government to be sinful than it is to regard the
same tax as "abridging the freedom . . . of the press" of those publishing
companies that must pay the tax as a condition of staying in business. It is a
permissible reading of the text, in the one case as in the other, to say that, if
prohibiting the exercise of religion (or burdening the activity of printing) is not
the object of the tax, but merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable
and otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has not been offended.
Our decisions reveal that the latter reading is the correct one. We have never
held that an individual's religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an
otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate. On the
contrary, the record of more than a century of our free exercise jurisprudence
contradicts that proposition. As described succinctly by Justice Frankfurter in
Minersville School Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Gobitis (1940):
Conscientious scruples have not, in the course of the long struggle for religious
toleration, relieved the individual from obedience to a general law not aimed at
the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs. The mere possession of religious
convictions which contradict the relevant concerns of a political society does not
relieve the citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities.

(Footnote omitted.) We first had occasion to assert that principle in Reynolds v.
United States (1879), where we rejected the claim that criminal laws against

Robson

1107

The First Amendment

polygamy could not be constitutionally applied to those whose religion
commanded the practice. "Laws," we said,
are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with
mere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices. . . . Can a man
excuse his practices to the contrary because of his religious belief? To permit
this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the
law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto
himself.

Subsequent decisions have consistently held that the right of free exercise does
not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law
of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes)
conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).
In Prince v. Massachusetts (1944), we held that a mother could be prosecuted
under the child labor laws for using her children to dispense literature in the
streets, her religious motivation notwithstanding. We found no constitutional
infirmity in "excluding [these children] from doing there what no other children
may do." In Braunfeld v. Brown (1961) (plurality opinion), we upheld Sunday
closing laws against the claim that they burdened the religious practices of
persons whose religions compelled them to refrain from work on other days. In
Gillette v. United States (1971), we sustained the military selective service
system against the claim that it violated free exercise by conscripting persons
who opposed a particular war on religious grounds.***
The only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment bars
application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action
have involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free Exercise Clause
in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such as freedom of speech
and of the press, see Cantwell v. Connecticut (invalidating a licensing system for
religious and charitable solicitations under which the administrator had
discretion to deny a license to any cause he deemed nonreligious); Murdock v.
Pennsylvania (1943) (invalidating a flat tax on solicitation as applied to the
dissemination of religious ideas); Follett v. McCormick (1944) (same), or the right
of parents, acknowledged in Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), to direct the
education of their children, see Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972) (invalidating
compulsory school attendance laws as applied to Amish parents who refused on
religious grounds to send their children to school). Some of our cases
prohibiting compelled expression, decided exclusively upon free speech grounds,
have also involved freedom of religion, cf. Wooley v. Maynard (1977)
(invalidating compelled display of a license plate slogan that offended individual
religious beliefs); West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette (1943)
(invalidating compulsory flag salute statute challenged by religious objectors).
And it is easy to envision a case in which a challenge on freedom of association
grounds would likewise be reinforced by Free Exercise Clause concerns. Cf.
Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1983) ("An individual's freedom to speak, to
worship, and to petition the government for the redress of grievances could not
be vigorously protected from interference by the State [if] a correlative freedom
to engage in group effort toward those ends were not also guaranteed.").
The present case does not present such a hybrid situation, but a free exercise
claim unconnected with any communicative activity or parental right.
Robson

1108

The First Amendment

Respondents urge us to hold, quite simply, that when otherwise prohibitable
conduct is accompanied by religious convictions, not only the convictions but
the conduct itself must be free from governmental regulation. We have never
held that, and decline to do so now. There being no contention that Oregon's
drug law represents an attempt to regulate religious beliefs, the communication
of religious beliefs, or the raising of one's children in those beliefs, the rule to
which we have adhered ever since Reynolds plainly controls.
Our cases do not at their farthest reach support the proposition that a stance of
conscientious opposition relieves an objector from any colliding duty fixed by a
democratic government.

Gillette v. United States (1971).
B
Respondents argue that, even though exemption from generally applicable
criminal laws need not automatically be extended to religiously motivated actors,
at least the claim for a religious exemption must be evaluated under the
balancing test set forth in Sherbert v. Verner (1963). Under the Sherbert test,
governmental actions that substantially burden a religious practice must be
justified by a compelling governmental interest. Applying that test, we have, on
three occasions, invalidated state unemployment compensation rules that
conditioned the availability of benefits upon an applicant's willingness to work
under conditions forbidden by his religion. See Sherbert v. Verner; Thomas v.
Review Board, Indiana Employment Div.; Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals
Comm'n of Florida. We have never invalidated any governmental action on the
basis of the Sherbert test except the denial of unemployment compensation.
Although we have sometimes purported to apply the Sherbert test in contexts
other than that, we have always found the test satisfied, see United States v. Lee
(1982);Gillette v. United States. In recent years we have abstained from applying
the Sherbert test (outside the unemployment compensation field) at all. In
Bowen v. Roy (1986), we declined to apply Sherbert analysis to a federal
statutory scheme that required benefit applicants and recipients to provide
their Social Security numbers. The plaintiffs in that case asserted that it would
violate their religious beliefs to obtain and provide a Social Security number for
their daughter. We held the statute's application to the plaintiffs valid
regardless of whether it was necessary to effectuate a compelling interest. In
Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn. (1988), we declined to apply
Sherbert analysis to the Government's logging and road construction activities
on lands used for religious purposes by several Native American Tribes, even
though it was undisputed that the activities "could have devastating effects on
traditional Indian religious practices." In Goldman v. Weinberger (1986), we
rejected application of the Sherbert test to military dress regulations that
forbade the wearing of yarmulkes. In O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz (1987), we
sustained, without mentioning the Sherbert test, a prison's refusal to excuse
inmates from work requirements to attend worship services.
Even if we were inclined to breathe into Sherbert some life beyond the
unemployment compensation field, we would not apply it to require exemptions
from a generally applicable criminal law. The Sherbert test, it must be recalled,
was developed in a context that lent itself to individualized governmental
assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct. As a plurality of the Court

Robson

1109

The First Amendment

noted in Roy, a distinctive feature of unemployment compensation programs is
that their eligibility criteria invite consideration of the particular circumstances
behind an applicant's unemployment ***
As the plurality pointed out in Roy, our decisions in the unemployment cases
stand for the proposition that where the State has in place a system of
individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of
"religious hardship" without compelling reason.
Whether or not the decisions are that limited, they at least have nothing to do
with an across-the-board criminal prohibition on a particular form of conduct.
*** We conclude today that the sounder approach, and the approach in accord
with the vast majority of our precedents, is to hold the test inapplicable to such
challenges. The government's ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions
of socially harmful conduct, like its ability to carry out other aspects of public
policy, "cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a
religious objector's spiritual development." Lyng. To make an individual's
obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law's coincidence with his
religious beliefs, except where the State's interest is "compelling" -- permitting
him, by virtue of his beliefs, "to become a law unto himself," Reynolds v. United
States -- contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.
The "compelling government interest" requirement seems benign, because it is
familiar from other fields. But using it as the standard that must be met before
the government may accord different treatment on the basis of race, see, e.g.,
Palmore v. Sidoti (1984), or before the government may regulate the content of
speech, see, e.g., Sable Communications of California v. FCC (1989), is not
remotely comparable to using it for the purpose asserted here. What it produces
in those other fields -- equality of treatment, and an unrestricted flow of
contending speech -- are constitutional norms; what it would produce here -- a
private right to ignore generally applicable laws -- is a constitutional anomaly.
Nor is it possible to limit the impact of respondents' proposal by requiring a
"compelling state interest" only when the conduct prohibited is "central" to the
individual's religion. Cf. Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn.
(BRENNAN, J., dissenting). It is no more appropriate for judges to determine the
"centrality" of religious beliefs before applying a "compelling interest" test in the
free exercise field than it would be for them to determine the "importance" of
ideas before applying the "compelling interest" test in the free speech field. What
principle of law or logic can be brought to bear to contradict a believer's
assertion that a particular act is "central" to his personal faith? Judging the
centrality of different religious practices is akin to the unacceptable "business of
evaluating the relative merits of differing religious claims." *** Repeatedly and in
many different contexts, we have warned that courts must not presume to
determine the place of a particular belief in a religion or the plausibility of a
religious claim.
If the "compelling interest" test is to be applied at all, then, it must be applied
across the board, to all actions thought to be religiously commanded. Moreover,
if "compelling interest" really means what it says (and watering it down here
would subvert its rigor in the other fields where it is applied), many laws will
not meet the test. Any society adopting such a system would be courting

Robson

1110

The First Amendment

anarchy, but that danger increases in direct proportion to the society's diversity
of religious beliefs, and its determination to coerce or suppress none of them.
Precisely because "we are a cosmopolitan nation made up of people of almost
every conceivable religious preference,"Braunfeld v. Brown, and precisely
because we value and protect that religious divergence, we cannot afford the
luxury of deeming presumptively invalid, as applied to the religious objector,
every regulation of conduct that does not protect an interest of the highest
order. The rule respondents favor would open the prospect of constitutionally
required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable
kind -- ranging from compulsory military service, to the payment of taxes, to
health and safety regulation such as manslaughter and child neglect laws,
compulsory vaccination laws, drug laws, and traffic laws; to social welfare
legislation such as minimum wage laws, child labor laws, animal cruelty laws,
environmental protection laws, and laws providing for equality of opportunity
for the races. The First Amendment's protection of religious liberty does not
require this.
Values that are protected against government interference through
enshrinement in the Bill of Rights are not thereby banished from the political
process. Just as a society that believes in the negative protection accorded to
the press by the First Amendment is likely to enact laws that affirmatively foster
the dissemination of the printed word, so also a society that believes in the
negative protection accorded to religious belief can be expected to be solicitous
of that value in its legislation as well. It is therefore not surprising that a
number of States have made an exception to their drug laws for sacramental
peyote use. But to say that a nondiscriminatory religious practice exemption is
permitted, or even that it is desirable, is not to say that it is constitutionally
required, and that the appropriate occasions for its creation can be discerned
by the courts. It may fairly be said that leaving accommodation to the political
process will place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are
not widely engaged in; but that unavoidable consequence of democratic
government must be preferred to a system in which each conscience is a law
unto itself or in which judges weigh the social importance of all laws against the
centrality of all religious beliefs.
Because respondents' ingestion of peyote was prohibited under Oregon law, and
because that prohibition is constitutional, Oregon may, consistent with the Free
Exercise Clause, deny respondents unemployment compensation when their
dismissal results from use of the drug. The decision of the Oregon Supreme
Court is accordingly reversed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, WITH WHOM JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, AND JUSTICE
BLACKMUN JOIN AS TO PARTS I AND II CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
Although I agree with the result the Court reaches in this case, I cannot join its
opinion. In my view, today's holding dramatically departs from well settled First
Amendment jurisprudence, appears unnecessary to resolve the question
presented, and is incompatible with our Nation's fundamental commitment to
individual religious liberty.

Robson

1111

The First Amendment

I
At the outset, I note that I agree with the Court's implicit determination that the
constitutional question upon which we granted review -- whether the Free
Exercise Clause protects a person's religiously motivated use of peyote from the
reach of a State's general criminal law prohibition -- is properly presented in
this case. ***
II
The Court today extracts from our long history of free exercise precedents the
single categorical rule that
if prohibiting the exercise of religion . . . is . . . merely the incidental
effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the First
Amendment has not been offended.
Indeed, the Court holds that, where the law is a generally applicable criminal
prohibition, our usual free exercise jurisprudence does not even apply. To reach
this sweeping result, however, the Court must not only give a strained reading
of the First Amendment but must also disregard our consistent application of
free exercise doctrine to cases involving generally applicable regulations that
burden religious conduct.
A
*** The Court endeavors to escape from our decisions in Cantwell and Yoder by
labeling them "hybrid" decisions, but there is no denying that both cases
expressly relied on the Free Exercise Clause, and that we have consistently
regarded those cases as part of the mainstream of our free exercise
jurisprudence. Moreover, in each of the other cases cited by the Court to
support its categorical rule, we rejected the particular constitutional claims
before us only after carefully weighing the competing interests. See Prince v.
Massachusetts (1944) (state interest in regulating children's activities justifies
denial of religious exemption from child labor laws); Braunfeld v. Brown (1961)
(plurality opinion) (state interest in uniform day of rest justifies denial of
religious exemption from Sunday closing law); Gillette (state interest in military
affairs justifies denial of religious exemption from conscription laws); Lee (state
interest in comprehensive social security system justifies denial of religious
exemption from mandatory participation requirement). That we rejected the free
exercise claims in those cases hardly calls into question the applicability of
First Amendment doctrine in the first place. Indeed, it is surely unusual to
judge the vitality of a constitutional doctrine by looking to the win-loss record of
the plaintiffs who happen to come before us.
B
Respondents, of course, do not contend that their conduct is automatically
immune from all governmental regulation simply because it is motivated by
their sincere religious beliefs. The Court's rejection of that argument, might
therefore be regarded as merely harmless dictum. Rather, respondents invoke
our traditional compelling interest test to argue that the Free Exercise Clause
requires the State to grant them a limited exemption from its general criminal
prohibition against the possession of peyote. The Court today, however, denies
them even the opportunity to make that argument, concluding that "the
sounder approach, and the approach in accord with the vast majority of our

Robson

1112

The First Amendment

precedents, is to hold the [compelling interest] test inapplicable to" challenges
to general criminal prohibitions.
In my view, however, the essence of a free exercise claim is relief from a burden
imposed by government on religious practices or beliefs, whether the burden is
imposed directly through laws that prohibit or compel specific religious
practices, or indirectly through laws that, in effect, make abandonment of one's
own religion or conformity to the religious beliefs of others the price of an equal
place in the civil community. ***
A State that makes criminal an individual's religiously motivated conduct
burdens that individual's free exercise of religion in the severest manner
possible, for it "results in the choice to the individual of either abandoning his
religious principle or facing criminal prosecution."Braunfeld. I would have
thought it beyond argument that such laws implicate free exercise concerns.
Indeed, we have never distinguished between cases in which a State conditions
receipt of a benefit on conduct prohibited by religious beliefs and cases in which
a State affirmatively prohibits such conduct. The Sherbert compelling interest
test applies in both kinds of cases. ***
To me, the sounder approach -- the approach more consistent with our role as
judges to decide each case on its individual merits -- is to apply this test in
each case to determine whether the burden on the specific plaintiffs before us is
constitutionally significant, and whether the particular criminal interest
asserted by the State before us is compelling. Even if, as an empirical matter, a
government's criminal laws might usually serve a compelling interest in health,
safety, or public order, the First Amendment at least requires a case-by-case
determination of the question, sensitive to the facts of each particular claim.
Given the range of conduct that a State might legitimately make criminal, we
cannot assume, merely because a law carries criminal sanctions and is
generally applicable, that the First Amendment never requires the State to grant
a limited exemption for religiously motivated conduct.
Moreover, we have not "rejected" or "declined to apply" the compelling interest
test in our recent cases. ***
The Court today gives no convincing reason to depart from settled First
Amendment jurisprudence. There is nothing talismanic about neutral laws of
general applicability or general criminal prohibitions, for laws neutral toward
religion can coerce a person to violate his religious conscience or intrude upon
his religious duties just as effectively as laws aimed at religion. Although the
Court suggests that the compelling interest test, as applied to generally
applicable laws, would result in a "constitutional anomaly," the First
Amendment unequivocally makes freedom of religion, like freedom from race
discrimination and freedom of speech, a "constitutional nor[m]," not an
"anomaly." Nor would application of our established free exercise doctrine to
this case necessarily be incompatible with our equal protection cases. We have,
in any event, recognized that the Free Exercise Clause protects values distinct
from those protected by the Equal Protection Clause. As the language of the
Clause itself makes clear, an individual's free exercise of religion is a preferred
constitutional activity. A law that makes criminal such an activity therefore
triggers constitutional concern -- and heightened judicial scrutiny -- even if it

Robson

1113

The First Amendment

does not target the particular religious conduct at issue. Our free speech cases
similarly recognize that neutral regulations that affect free speech values are
subject to a balancing, rather than categorical, approach. The Court's parade of
horribles not only fails as a reason for discarding the compelling interest test, it
instead demonstrates just the opposite: that courts have been quite capable of
applying our free exercise jurisprudence to strike sensible balances between
religious liberty and competing state interests.
Finally, the Court today suggests that the disfavoring of minority religions is an
"unavoidable consequence" under our system of government, and that
accommodation of such religions must be left to the political process. In my
view, however, the First Amendment was enacted precisely to protect the rights
of those whose religious practices are not shared by the majority and may be
viewed with hostility. The history of our free exercise doctrine amply
demonstrates the harsh impact majoritarian rule has had on unpopular or
emerging religious groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Amish.
Indeed, the words of Justice Jackson in West Virginia Board of Education v.
Barnette (overruling Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940)) are apt.
The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the
vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities
and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.
One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of
worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to
vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.

See also United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78, 87 (1944) ("The Fathers of the
Constitution were not unaware of the varied and extreme views of religious
sects, of the violence of disagreement among them, and of, the lack of any one
religions creed on which all men would agree. They fashioned a charter of
government which envisaged the widest possible toleration of conflicting views").
The compelling interest test reflects the First Amendment's mandate of
preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society.
For the Court to deem this command a "luxury," is to denigrate "[t]he very
purpose of a Bill of Rights."
III
The Court's holding today not only misreads settled First Amendment
precedent; it appears to be unnecessary to this case. I would reach the same
result applying our established free exercise jurisprudence. ***
I would therefore adhere to our established free exercise jurisprudence and hold
that the State in this case has a compelling interest in regulating peyote use by
its citizens, and that accommodating respondents' religiously motivated
conduct "will unduly interfere with fulfillment of the governmental interest."
Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE BRENNAN AND JUSTICE MARSHALL JOIN,
DISSENTING.
This Court over the years painstakingly has developed a consistent and
exacting standard to test the constitutionality of a state statute that burdens

Robson

1114

The First Amendment

the free exercise of religion. Such a statute may stand only if the law in general,
and the State's refusal to allow a religious exemption in particular, are justified
by a compelling interest that cannot be served by less restrictive means.
Until today, I thought this was a settled and inviolate principle of this Court's
First Amendment jurisprudence. The majority, however, perfunctorily dismisses
it as a "constitutional anomaly." As carefully detailed in Justice O'Connor’s
concurring opinion, the majority is able to arrive at this view only by
mischaracterizing this Court's precedents. The Court discards leading free
exercise cases such as Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940), and Wisconsin v. Yoder
(1972), as "hybrid." The Court views traditional free exercise analysis as
somehow inapplicable to criminal prohibitions (as opposed to conditions on the
receipt of benefits), and to state laws of general applicability (as opposed,
presumably, to laws that expressly single out religious practices). The Court
cites cases in which, due to various exceptional circumstances, we found strict
scrutiny inapposite, to hint that the Court has repudiated that standard
altogether. In short, it effectuates a wholesale overturning of settled law
concerning the Religion Clauses of our Constitution. One hopes that the Court
is aware of the consequences, and that its result is not a product of
overreaction to the serious problems the country's drug crisis has generated.
This distorted view of our precedents leads the majority to conclude that strict
scrutiny of a state law burdening the free exercise of religion is a "luxury" that a
well-ordered society cannot afford, and that the repression of minority religions
is an "unavoidable consequence of democratic government." I do not believe the
Founders thought their dearly bought freedom from religious persecution a
"luxury," but an essential element of liberty -- and they could not have thought
religious intolerance "unavoidable," for they drafted the Religion Clauses
precisely in order to avoid that intolerance.
For these reasons, I agree with Justice O'Connor's analysis of the applicable
free exercise doctrine, and I join parts I and II of her opinion. As she points out,
the critical question in this case is whether exempting respondents from
the State's general criminal prohibition "will unduly interfere with
fulfillment of the governmental interest."
I do disagree, however, with her specific answer to that question.
I
In weighing respondents' clear interest in the free exercise of their religion
against Oregon's asserted interest in enforcing its drug laws, it is important to
articulate in precise terms the state interest involved. It is not the State's broad
interest[in fighting the critical "war on drugs" that must be weighed against
respondents' claim, but the State's narrow interest in refusing to make an
exception for the religious, ceremonial use of peyote. ***
The State's interest in enforcing its prohibition, in order to be sufficiently
compelling to outweigh a free exercise claim, cannot be merely abstract or
symbolic. The State cannot plausibly assert that unbending application of a
criminal prohibition is essential to fulfill any compelling interest if it does not,
in fact, attempt to enforce that prohibition. In this case, the State actually has
not evinced any concrete interest in enforcing its drug laws against religious

Robson

1115

The First Amendment

users of peyote. Oregon has never sought to prosecute respondents, and does
not claim that it has made significant enforcement efforts against other
religious users of peyote. The State's asserted interest thus amounts only to the
symbolic preservation of an unenforced prohibition. But a government interest
in "symbolism, even symbolism for so worthy a cause as the abolition of
unlawful drugs," Treasury Employees v. Von Raab (1989) (SCALIA, J.,
dissenting), cannot suffice to abrogate the constitutional rights of individuals.
Similarly, this Court's prior decisions have not allowed a government to rely on
mere speculation about potential harms, but have demanded evidentiary
support for a refusal to allow a religious exception. ***
The State proclaims an interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens
from the dangers of unlawful drugs. It offers, however, no evidence that the
religious use of peyote has ever harmed anyone. The factual findings of other
courts cast doubt on the State's assumption that religious use of peyote is
harmful. ***
The fact that peyote is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance does not,
by itself, show that any and all uses of peyote, in any circumstance, are
inherently harmful and dangerous. The Federal Government, which created the
classifications of unlawful drugs from which Oregon's drug laws are derived,
apparently does not find peyote so dangerous as to preclude an exemption for
religious use. Moreover, other Schedule I drugs have lawful uses.
The carefully circumscribed ritual context in which respondents used peyote is
far removed from the irresponsible and unrestricted recreational use of
unlawful drugs. The Native American Church's internal restrictions on, and
supervision of, its members' use of peyote substantially obviate the State's
health and safety concerns.
*** Far from promoting the lawless and irresponsible use of drugs, Native
American Church members' spiritual code exemplifies values that Oregon's
drug laws are presumably intended to foster.
The State also seeks to support its refusal to make an exception for religious
use of peyote by invoking its interest in abolishing drug trafficking. There is,
however, practically no illegal traffic in peyote. ***Peyote simply is not a popular
drug; its distribution for use in religious rituals has nothing to do with the vast
and violent traffic in illegal narcotics that plagues this country.
Finally, the State argues that granting an exception for religious peyote use
would erode its interest in the uniform, fair, and certain enforcement of its drug
laws. The State fears that, if it grants an exemption for religious peyote use, a
flood of other claims to religious exemptions will follow. It would then be placed
in a dilemma, it says, between allowing a patchwork of exemptions that would
hinder its law enforcement efforts, and risking a violation of the Establishment
Clause by arbitrarily limiting its religious exemptions. This argument, however,
could be made in almost any free exercise case. This Court, however,
consistently has rejected similar arguments in past free exercise cases, and it
should do so here as well.
The State's apprehension of a flood of other religious claims is purely
speculative. Almost half the States, and the Federal Government, have

Robson

1116

The First Amendment

maintained an exemption for religious peyote use for many years, and
apparently have not found themselves overwhelmed by claims to other religious
exemptions. Allowing an exemption for religious peyote use would not
necessarily oblige the State to grant a similar exemption to other religious
groups. The unusual circumstances that make the religious use of peyote
compatible with the State's interests in health and safety and in preventing
drug trafficking would not apply to other religious claims. ***
II
Finally, although I agree with Justice O'Connor that courts should refrain from
delving into questions of whether, as a matter of religious doctrine, a particular
practice is "central" to the religion, I do not think this means that the courts
must turn a blind eye to the severe impact of a State's restrictions on the
adherents of a minority religion.
Respondents believe, and their sincerity has never been at issue, that the
peyote plant embodies their deity, and eating it is an act of worship and
communion. Without peyote, they could not enact the essential ritual of their
religion.
If Oregon can constitutionally prosecute them for this act of worship, they, like
the Amish, may be "forced to migrate to some other and more tolerant region."
Yoder. This potentially devastating impact must be viewed in light of the federal
policy -- reached in reaction to many years of religious persecution and
intolerance -- of protecting the religious freedom of Native Americans. See
American Indian Religious Freedom Act, 92 Stat. 469,42 U.S.C. §1996("it shall
be the policy of the United States to protect and preserve for American Indians
their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise the traditional
religions . . . , including but not limited to access to sites, use and possession of
sacred objects, and the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional
rites"). Congress recognized that certain substances, such as peyote,
have religious significance because they are sacred, they have power, they heal,
they are necessary to the exercise of the rites of the religion, they are necessary
to the cultural integrity of the tribe, and, therefore, religious survival.

H.R.Rep. No. 95-1308 (1978).
The American Indian Religious Freedom Act, in itself, may not create rights
enforceable against government action restricting religious freedom, but this
Court must scrupulously apply its free exercise analysis to the religious claims
of Native Americans, however unorthodox they may be. Otherwise, both the
First Amendment and the stated policy of Congress will offer to Native
Americans merely an unfulfilled and hollow promise.
III
For these reasons, I conclude that Oregon's interest in enforcing its drug laws
against religious use of peyote is not sufficiently compelling to outweigh
respondents' right to the free exercise of their religion. Since the State could not
constitutionally enforce its criminal prohibition against respondents, the
interests underlying the State's drug laws cannot justify its denial of
unemployment benefits. Absent such justification, the State's regulatory
interest in denying benefits for religiously motivated "misconduct," is

Robson

The First Amendment

indistinguishable from the state interests this Court has rejected in Frazee,
Hobbie, Thomas, and Sherbert. The State of Oregon cannot, consistently with
the Free Exercise Clause, deny respondents unemployment benefits.

A.	  RFRA	  
Text	  of	  Religious	  Freedom	  Restoration	  Act	  (RFRA)	  

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-141, 107
Stat. 1488 (November 16, 1993), codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb through
42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-4, was specifically passed to counteract the Court’s
decision in Smith and “restore” a higher level of scrutiny.
42 U.S. Code § 2000bb provides:
(a) Findings
The Congress finds that—
(1) the framers of the Constitution, recognizing free exercise of religion as an
unalienable right, secured its protection in the First Amendment to the Constitution;
(2) laws “neutral” toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as
laws intended to interfere with religious exercise;
(3) governments should not substantially burden religious exercise without
compelling justification;
(4) in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990) the Supreme Court
virtually eliminated the requirement that the government justify burdens on religious
exercise imposed by laws neutral toward religion; and
(5) the compelling interest test as set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a
workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing
prior governmental interests.
(b) Purposes
The purposes of this chapter are—
(1) to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374
U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972) and to guarantee its
application in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened; and
(2) to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is
substantially burdened by government.
42 U.S. Code § 2000bb-1 articulated the appropriate test:
(a) In general

Robson

1118

The First Amendment

Government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if the
burden results from a rule of general applicability, except as provided in subsection (b)
of this section.
(b) Exception
Government may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if it
demonstrates that application of the burden to the person—
(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and
(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental
interest.
(c) Judicial relief
A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may
assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain
appropriate relief against a government. Standing to assert a claim or defense under
this section shall be governed by the general rules of standing under article III of the
Constitution.

Note:	  The	  Constitutionality	  of	  RFRA	  
In City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997), the United States
Supreme Court held that imposing RFRA’s requirements on the states
exceeded Congressional power under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the Court stated that the §5 power “to
enforce” is only preventive or “remedial:” “There must be a congruence
and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and
the means adopted to that end.” RFRA, the Court concluded, altered the
Free Exercise Clause’s meaning and thus cannot be said to be enforcing
the Clause. “Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing
what the right is.” The Court also noted that the least restrictive means
requirement in RFRA was not used in the pre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA
purported to codify.

ROBERTS, C. J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH ALL OTHER MEMBERS JOINED,
EXCEPT ALITO, J., WHO TOOK NO PART IN THE CONSIDERATION OR DECISION OF THE CASE.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
A religious sect with origins in the Amazon Rainforest receives communion by
drinking a sacramental tea, brewed from plants unique to the region, that
contains a hallucinogen regulated under the Controlled Substances Act by the
Federal Government. The Government concedes that this practice is a sincere
exercise of religion, but nonetheless sought to prohibit the small American
branch of the sect from engaging in the practice, on the ground that the

Robson

1119

The First Amendment

Controlled Substances Act bars all use of the hallucinogen. The sect sued to
block enforcement against it of the ban on the sacramental tea, and moved for a
preliminary injunction.
It relied on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which prohibits the
Federal Government from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion,
unless the Government "demonstrates that application of the burden to the
person" represents the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling
interest. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b). The District Court granted the preliminary
injunction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We granted the Government's
petition for certiorari. Before this Court, the Government's central submission is
that it has a compelling interest in the uniform application of the Controlled
Substances Act, such that no exception to the ban on use of the hallucinogen
can be made to accommodate the sect's sincere religious practice. We conclude
that the Government has not carried the burden expressly placed on it by
Congress in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and affirm the grant of the
preliminary injunction.
I
In Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith (1990), this
Court held that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment does not
prohibit governments from burdening religious practices through generally
applicable laws. In Smith, we rejected a challenge to an Oregon statute that
denied unemployment benefits to drug users, including Native Americans
engaged in the sacramental use of peyote. In so doing, we rejected the
interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause announced in Sherbert v. Verner
(1963),and, in accord with earlier cases, held that the Constitution does not
require judges to engage in a case-by-case assessment of the religious burdens
imposed by facially constitutional laws.
Congress responded by enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993
(RFRA), which adopts a statutory rule comparable to the constitutional rule
rejected in Smith. Under RFRA, the Federal Government may not, as a statutory
matter, substantially burden a person's exercise of religion, "even if the burden
results from a rule of general applicability." § 2000bb-1(a). The only exception
recognized by the statute requires the Government to satisfy the compelling
interest test—to "demonstrat[e] that application of the burden to the person—(1)
is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least
restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest." §
2000bb-1(b). A person whose religious practices are burdened in violation of
RFRA "may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding
and obtain appropriate relief." § 2000bb-1(c).
The Controlled Substances Act regulates the importation, manufacture,
distribution, and use of psychotropic substances. The Act classifies substances
into five schedules based on their potential for abuse, the extent to which they
have an accepted medical use, and their safety. Substances listed in Schedule I
of the Act are subject to the most comprehensive restrictions, including an
outright ban on all importation and use, except pursuant to strictly regulated
research projects. The Act authorizes the imposition of a criminal sentence for
simple possession of Schedule I substances, and mandates the imposition of a

Robson

1120

The First Amendment

criminal sentence for possession "with intent to manufacture, distribute, or
dispense" such substances.
O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal (UDV) is a Christian Spiritist
sect based in Brazil, with an American branch of approximately 130 individuals.
Central to the UDV's faith is receiving communion through hoasca (pronounced
"wass-ca"), a sacramental tea made from two plants unique to the Amazon
region. One of the plants, psychotriaviridis, contains dimethyltryptamine (DMT),
a hallucinogen whose effects are enhanced by alkaloids from the other plant,
banisteriopsis caapi. DMT, as well as "any material, compound, mixture, or
preparation, which contains any quantity of [DMT]," is listed in Schedule I of
the Controlled Substances Act.
In 1999, United States Customs inspectors intercepted a shipment to the
American UDV containing three drums of hoasca. A subsequent investigation
revealed that the UDV had received 14 prior shipments of hoasca. The
inspectors seized the intercepted shipment and threatened the UDV with
prosecution.
The UDV filed suit against the Attorney General and other federal law
enforcement officials, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The complaint
alleged, inter alia, that applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV's
sacramental use of hoasca violates RFRA. Prior to trial, the UDV moved for a
preliminary injunction, so that it could continue to practice its faith pending
trial on the merits.
At a hearing on the preliminary injunction, the Government conceded that the
challenged application of the Controlled Substances Act would substantially
burden a sincere exercise of religion by the UDV. The Government argued,
however, that this burden did not violate RFRA, because applying the
Controlled Substances Act in this case was the least restrictive means of
advancing three compelling governmental interests: protecting the health and
safety of UDV members, preventing the diversion of hoasca from the church to
recreational users, and complying with the 1971 United Nations Convention on
Psychotropic Substances, a treaty signed by the United States and implemented
by the Act.
The District Court heard evidence from both parties on the health risks of
hoasca and the potential for diversion from the church. The Government
presented evidence to the effect that use of hoasca, or DMT more generally, can
cause psychotic reactions, cardiac irregularities, and adverse drug interactions.
The UDV countered by citing studies documenting the safety of its sacramental
use of hoasca and presenting evidence that minimized the likelihood of the
health risks raised by the Government. With respect to diversion, the
Government pointed to a general rise in the illicit use of hallucinogens, and
cited interest in the illegal use of DMT and hoasca in particular; the UDV
emphasized the thinness of any market for hoasca, the relatively small amounts
of the substance imported by the church, and the absence of any diversion
problem in the past.
The District Court concluded that the evidence on health risks was "in
equipoise," and similarly that the evidence on diversion was "virtually
balanced." In the face of such an even showing, the court reasoned that the

Robson

1121

The First Amendment

Government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest justifying what it
acknowledged was a substantial burden on the UDV's sincere religious exercise.
The court also rejected the asserted interest in complying with the 1971
Convention on Psychotropic Substances, holding that the Convention does not
apply to hoasca.
The court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Government from
enforcing the Controlled Substances Act with respect to the UDV's importation
and use of hoasca. The injunction requires the church to import the tea
pursuant to federal permits, to restrict control over the tea to persons of church
authority, and to warn particularly susceptible UDV members of the dangers of
hoasca. The injunction also provides that "if [the Government] believe[s] that
evidence exists that hoasca has negatively affected the health of UDV
members," or "that a shipment of hoasca contain[s] particularly dangerous
levels of DMT, [the Government] may apply to the Court for an expedite[d]
determination of whether the evidence warrants suspension or revocation of
[the UDV's authority to use hoasca]."
The Government appealed the preliminary injunction and a panel of the Court
of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, as did a majority of the Circuit sitting
en banc. We granted certiorari.
II
Although its briefs contain some discussion of the potential for harm and
diversion from the UDV's use of hoasca ,the Government does not challenge the
District Court's factual findings or its conclusion that the evidence submitted
on these issues was evenly balanced. Instead, the Government maintains that
such evidentiary equipoise is an insufficient basis for issuing a preliminary
injunction against enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act. ***
III
The Government's second line of argument rests on the Controlled Substances
Act itself. The Government contends that the Act's description of Schedule I
substances as having "a high potential for abuse," "no currently accepted
medical use in treatment in the United States," and "a lack of accepted safety
for use . . . under medical supervision," by itself precludes any consideration of
individualized exceptions such as that sought by the UDV. The Government
goes on to argue that the regulatory regime established by the Act—a "closed"
system that prohibits all use of controlled substances except as authorized by
the Act itself — "cannot function with its necessary rigor and
comprehensiveness if subjected to judicial exemptions." According to the
Government, there would be no way to cabin religious exceptions once
recognized, and "the public will misread" such exceptions as signaling that the
substance at issue is not harmful after all. Under the Government's view, there
is no need to assess the particulars of the UDV's use or weigh the impact of an
exemption for that specific use, because the Controlled Substances Act serves a
compelling purpose and simply admits of no exceptions.
A
RFRA, and the strict scrutiny test it adopted, contemplate an inquiry more
focused than the Government's categorical approach. RFRA requires the

Robson

1122

The First Amendment

Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied
through application of the challenged law "to the person"—the particular
claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.
RFRA expressly adopted the compelling interest test "as set forth in Sherbert v.
Verner (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972)." In each of those cases, this Court
looked beyond broadly formulated interests justifying the general applicability
of government mandates and scrutinized the asserted harm of granting specific
exemptions to particular religious claimants. In Yoder, for example, we
permitted an exemption for Amish children from a compulsory school
attendance law. We recognized that the State had a "paramount" interest in
education, but held that "despite its admitted validity in the generality of cases,
we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks to promote . . .
and the impediment to those objectives that would flow from recognizing the
claimed Amish exemption." (emphasis added). The Court explained that the State
needed "to show with more particularity how its admittedly strong interest . . .
would be adversely affected by granting an exemption to the Amish."(emphasis
added).
In Sherbert, the Court upheld a particular claim to a religious exemption from a
state law denying unemployment benefits to those who would not work on
Saturdays, but explained that it was not announcing a constitutional right to
unemployment benefits for "all persons whose religious convictions are the
cause of their unemployment." (emphasis added). The Court distinguished the
case "in which an employee's religious convictions serve to make him a
nonproductive member of society." Outside the Free Exercise area as well, the
Court has noted that "[c]ontext matters" in applying the compelling interest test,
Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), and has emphasized that "strict scrutiny does take
‘relevant differences’ into account—indeed, that is its fundamental
purpose,"Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña (1995).
B
Under the more focused inquiry required by RFRA and the compelling interest
test, the Government's mere invocation of the general characteristics of
Schedule I substances, as set forth in the Controlled Substances Act, cannot
carry the day. It is true, of course, that Schedule I substances such as DMT are
exceptionally dangerous. Nevertheless, there is no indication that Congress, in
classifying DMT, considered the harms posed by the particular use at issue
here— the circumscribed, sacramental use of hoasca by the UDV. The question
of the harms from the sacramental use of hoasca by the UDV was litigated
below. Before the District Court found that the Government had not carried its
burden of showing a compelling interest in preventing such harms, the court
noted that it could not "ignore that the legislative branch of the government
elected to place materials containing DMT in Schedule I of the [Act], reflecting
findings that substances containing DMT have `a high potential for abuse,' and
`no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,' and that
`[t]here is a lack of accepted safety for use of [DMT] under medical supervision.'"
But Congress' determination that DMT should be listed under Schedule I
simply does not provide a categorical answer that relieves the Government of
the obligation to shoulder its burden under RFRA.

Robson

1123

The First Amendment

This conclusion is reinforced by the Controlled Substances Act itself. The Act
contains a provision authorizing the Attorney General to "waive the requirement
for registration of certain manufacturers, distributors, or dispensers if he finds
it consistent with the public health and safety." The fact that the Act itself
contemplates that exempting certain people from its requirements would be
"consistent with the public health and safety" indicates that congressional
findings with respect to Schedule I substances should not carry the
determinative weight, for RFRA purposes, that the Government would ascribe to
them.
And in fact an exception has been made to the Schedule I ban for religious use.
For the past 35 years, there has been a regulatory exemption for use of peyote—
a Schedule I substance—by the Native American Church. In 1994, Congress
extended that exemption to all members of every recognized Indian Tribe.
Everything the Government says about the DMT in hoasca—that, as a Schedule
I substance, Congress has determined that it "has a high potential for abuse,"
"has no currently accepted medical use," and has "a lack of accepted safety for
use . . . under medical supervision" —applies in equal measure to the mescaline
in peyote, yet both the Executive and Congress itself have decreed an exception
from the Controlled Substances Act for Native American religious use of peyote.
If such use is permitted in the face of the congressional findings in § 812(b)(1)
for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans practicing their faith, it is
difficult to see how those same findings alone can preclude any consideration of
a similar exception for the 130 or so American members of the UDV who want
to practice theirs.
The Government responds that there is a "unique relationship" between the
United States and the Tribes, but never explains what about that "unique"
relationship justifies overriding the same congressional findings on which the
Government relies in resisting any exception for the UDV's religious use of
hoasca. In other words, if any Schedule I substance is in fact always highly
dangerous in any amount no matter how used, what about the unique
relationship with the Tribes justifies allowing their use of peyote? Nothing about
the unique political status of the Tribes makes their members immune from the
health risks the Government asserts accompany any use of a Schedule I
substance, nor insulates the Schedule I substance the Tribes use in religious
exercise from the alleged risk of diversion.
The Government argues that the existence of a congressional exemption for
peyote does not indicate that the Controlled Substances Act is amenable to
judicially crafted exceptions. RFRA, however, plainly contemplates that courts
would recognize exceptions—that is how the law works. Congress' role in the
peyote exemption—and the Executive's —confirms that the findings in the
Controlled Substances Act do not preclude exceptions altogether; RFRA makes
clear that it is the obligation of the courts to consider whether exceptions are
required under the test set forth by Congress.
C
The well-established peyote exception also fatally undermines the Government's
broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed
regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA. The Government
argues that the effectiveness of the Controlled Substances Act will be

Robson

1124

The First Amendment

"necessarily . . . undercut" if the Act is not uniformly applied, without regard to
burdens on religious exercise. The peyote exception, however, has been in place
since the outset of the Controlled Substances Act, and there is no evidence that
it has "undercut" the Government's ability to enforce the ban on peyote use by
non-Indians.
The Government points to some pre-Smith cases relying on a need for
uniformity in rejecting claims for religious exemptions under the Free Exercise
Clause, but those cases strike us as quite different from the present one. Those
cases did not embrace the notion that a general interest in uniformity justified a
substantial burden on religious exercise; they instead scrutinized the asserted
need and explained why the denied exemptions could not be accommodated. In
United States v. Lee (1982), for example, the Court rejected a claimed exception
to the obligation to pay Social Security taxes, noting that "mandatory
participation is indispensable to the fiscal vitality of the social security system"
and that the "tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to
challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that
violates their religious belief." See also Hernandez v. Commissioner (1989)
(same). In Braunfeld v. Brown (1961) (plurality opinion), the Court denied a
claimed exception to Sunday closing laws, in part because allowing such
exceptions "might well provide [the claimants] with an economic advantage over
their competitors who must remain closed on that day." The whole point of a
"uniform day of rest for all workers" would have been defeated by exceptions.
These cases show that the Government can demonstrate a compelling interest
in uniform application of a particular program by offering evidence that
granting the requested religious accommodations would seriously compromise
its ability to administer the program.
Here the Government's argument for uniformity is different; it rests not so
much on the particular statutory program at issue as on slippery-slope
concerns that could be invoked in response to any RFRA claim for an exception
to a generally applicable law. The Government's argument echoes the classic
rejoinder of bureaucrats throughout history: If I make an exception for you, I'll
have to make one for everybody, so no exceptions. But RFRA operates by
mandating consideration, under the compelling interest test, of exceptions to
"rule[s] of general applicability." Congress determined that the legislated test "is
a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and
competing prior governmental interests." This determination finds support in
our cases; in Sherbert, for example, we rejected a slippery-slope argument
similar to the one offered in this case, dismissing as "no more than a possibility"
the State's speculation "that the filing of fraudulent claims by unscrupulous
claimants feigning religious objections to Saturday work" would drain the
unemployment benefits fund.
*** We do not doubt that there may be instances in which a need for uniformity
precludes the recognition of exceptions to generally applicable laws under RFRA.
But it would have been surprising to find that this was such a case, given the
longstanding exemption from the Controlled Substances Act for religious use of
peyote, and the fact that the very reason Congress enacted RFRA was to
respond to a decision denying a claimed right to sacramental use of a controlled
substance. And in fact the Government has not offered evidence demonstrating

Robson

1125

The First Amendment

that granting the UDV an exemption would cause the kind of administrative
harm recognized as a compelling interest in Lee, Hernandez, and Braunfeld. The
Government failed to convince the District Court at the preliminary injunction
hearing that health or diversion concerns provide a compelling interest in
banning the UDV's sacramental use of hoasca. It cannot compensate for that
failure now with the bold argument that there can be no RFRA exceptions at all
to the Controlled Substances Act. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17 (Deputy Solicitor
General statement that exception could not be made even for "rigorously
policed" use of "one drop" of substance "once a year").
IV
Before the District Court, the Government also asserted an interest in
compliance with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic
Substances. The Convention, signed by the United States and implemented by
the Controlled Substances Act, calls on signatories to prohibit the use of
hallucinogens, including DMT. The Government argues that it has a compelling
interest in meeting its international obligations by complying with the
Convention.
The District Court rejected this interest because it found that the Convention
does not cover hoasca. ***
We do not agree. ***
The fact that hoasca is covered by the Convention, however, does not
automatically mean that the Government has demonstrated a compelling
interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act, which implements the
Convention, to the UDV's sacramental use of the tea. At the present stage, it
suffices to observe that the Government did not even submit evidence
addressing the international consequences of granting an exemption for the
UDV. The Government simply submitted two affidavits by State Department
officials attesting to the general importance of honoring international
obligations and of maintaining the leadership position of the United States in
the international war on drugs. We do not doubt the validity of these interests,
any more than we doubt the general interest in promoting public health and
safety by enforcing the Controlled Substances Act, but under RFRA invocation
of such general interests, standing alone, is not enough.
The Government repeatedly invokes Congress' findings and purposes
underlying the Controlled Substances Act, but Congress had a reason for
enacting RFRA, too. Congress recognized that "laws `neutral' toward religion
may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with
religious exercise," and legislated "the compelling interest test" as the means for
the courts to "strik[e] sensible balances between religious liberty and competing
prior governmental interests." 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb(a)(2), (5).
We have no cause to pretend that the task assigned by Congress to the courts
under RFRA is an easy one. Indeed, the very sort of difficulties highlighted by
the Government here were cited by this Court in deciding that the approach
later mandated by Congress under RFRA was not required as a matter of
constitutional law under the Free Exercise Clause. But Congress has
determined that courts should strike sensible balances, pursuant to a
compelling interest test that requires the Government to address the particular

Robson

1126

The First Amendment

practice at issue. Applying that test, we conclude that the courts below did not
err in determining that the Government failed to demonstrate, at the
preliminary injunction stage, a compelling interest in barring the UDV's
sacramental use of hoasca.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is
affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
It is so ordered.

Burwell	  v.	  Hobby	  Lobby	  Stores,	  Inc.	  
573 U.S. ___ (2014)

ALITO, J., DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT, IN WHICH ROBERTS, C. J., AND SCALIA,
KENNEDY, AND THOMAS, JJ., JOINED. KENNEDY, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION. GINSBURG, J.,
FILED A DISSENTING OPINION, IN WHICH SOTOMAYOR, J., JOINED, AND IN WHICH BREYER AND
KAGAN, JJ., JOINED AS TO ALL BUT PART III–C–1. BREYER AND KAGAN, JJ., FILED A DISSENTING
OPINION.

JUSTICE ALITO DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
We must decide in these cases whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act
of 1993 (RFRA), 107Stat. 1488, 42 U.S.C. §2000bb et seq., permits the United
States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to demand that three
closely held corporations provide health-insurance coverage for methods of
contraception that violate the sincerely held religious beliefs of the companies’
owners. We hold that the regulations that impose this obligation violate RFRA,
which prohibits the Federal Government from taking any action that
substantially burdens the exercise of religion unless that action constitutes the
least restrictive means of serving a compelling government interest.
In holding that the HHS mandate is unlawful, we reject HHS’s argument that
the owners of the companies forfeited all RFRA protection when they decided to
organize their businesses as corporations rather than sole proprietorships or
general partnerships. The plain terms of RFRA make it perfectly clear that
Congress did not discriminate in this way against men and women who wish to
run their businesses as for-profit corporations in the manner required by their
religious beliefs.
Since RFRA applies in these cases, we must decide whether the challenged HHS
regulations substantially burden the exercise of religion, and we hold that they
do. The owners of the businesses have religious objections to abortion, and
according to their religious beliefs the four contraceptive methods at issue are
abortifacients. If the owners comply with the HHS mandate, they believe they
will be facilitating abortions, and if they do not comply, they will pay a very
heavy price—as much as $1.3 million per day, or about $475 million per year,
in the case of one of the companies. If these consequences do not amount to a
substantial burden, it is hard to see what would.
Under RFRA, a Government action that imposes a substantial burden on
religious exercise must serve a compelling government interest, and we assume
that the HHS regulations satisfy this requirement. But in order for the HHS
Robson

1127

The First Amendment

mandate to be sustained, it must also constitute the least restrictive means of
serving that interest, and the mandate plainly fails that test. There are other
ways in which Congress or HHS could equally ensure that every woman has
cost-free access to the particular contraceptives at issue here and, indeed, to all
FDA-approved contraceptives.
In fact, HHS has already devised and implemented a system that seeks to
respect the religious liberty of religious nonprofit corporations while ensuring
that the employees of these entities have precisely the same access to all FDAapproved contraceptives as employees of companies whose owners have no
religious objections to providing such coverage. The employees of these religious
nonprofit corporations still have access to insurance coverage without cost
sharing for all FDA-approved contraceptives; and according to HHS, this system
imposes no net economic burden on the insurance companies that are required
to provide or secure the coverage.
Although HHS has made this system available to religious nonprofits that have
religious objections to the contraceptive mandate, HHS has provided no reason
why the same system cannot be made available when the owners of for-profit
corporations have similar religious objections. We therefore conclude that this
system constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Government’s aims
while providing greater respect for religious liberty. And under RFRA, that
conclusion means that enforcement of the HHS contraceptive mandate against
the objecting parties in these cases is unlawful.
As this description of our reasoning shows, our holding is very specific. We do
not hold, as the principal dissent alleges, that for-profit corporations and other
commercial enterprises can “opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge
incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs.” (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).
Nor do we hold, as the dissent implies, that such corporations have free rein to
take steps that impose “disadvantages ... on others” or that require “the general
public [to] pick up the tab.” And we certainly do not hold or suggest that “RFRA
demands accommodation of a for-profit corporation’s religious beliefs no matter
the impact that accommodation may have on ... thousands of women employed
by Hobby Lobby.” The effect of the HHS-created accommodation on the women
employed by Hobby Lobby and the other companies involved in these cases
would be precisely zero. Under that accommodation, these women would still be
entitled to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing.

A
[discussion of RFRA and Smith omitted].
B
At issue in these cases are HHS regulations promulgated under the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). ACA generally requires
employers with 50 or more full-time employees to offer “a group health plan or
group health insurance coverage” that provides “minimum essential coverage.”
Any covered employer that does not provide such coverage must pay a
substantial price. Specifically, if a covered employer provides group health
insurance but its plan fails to comply with ACA’s group-health-plan
requirements, the employer may be required to pay $100 per day for each
affected “individual.” And if the employer decides to stop providing health

Robson

1128

The First Amendment

insurance altogether and at least one full-time employee enrolls in a health plan
and qualifies for a subsidy on one of the government-run ACA exchanges, the
employer must pay $2,000 per year for each of its full-time employees.
Unless an exception applies, ACA requires an employer’s group health plan or
group-health-insurance coverage to furnish “preventive care and screenings” for
women without “any cost sharing requirements.” Congress itself, however, did
not specify what types of preventive care must be covered. Instead, Congress
authorized the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a
component of HHS, to make that important and sensitive decision. The HRSA in
turn consulted the Institute of Medicine, a nonprofit group of volunteer advisers,
in determining which preventive services to require.
In August 2011, based on the Institute’s recommendations, the HRSA
promulgated the Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines. The Guidelines
provide that nonexempt employers are generally required to provide “coverage,
without cost sharing” for “[a]ll Food and Drug Ad-ministration [(FDA)] approved
contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and
counseling.” Although many of the required, FDA-approved methods of
contraception work by preventing the fertilization of an egg, four of those
methods (those specifically at issue in these cases) may have the effect of
preventing an already fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting its
attachment to the uterus.
HHS also authorized the HRSA to establish exemptions from the contraceptive
mandate for “religious employers.” That category encompasses “churches, their
integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches,” as well as
“the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.” In its Guidelines,
HRSA exempted these organizations from the requirement to cover
contraceptive services.
In addition, HHS has effectively exempted certain religious nonprofit
organizations, described under HHS regulations as “eligible organizations,” from
the contraceptive mandate. An “eligible organization” means a nonprofit
organization that “holds itself out as a religious organization” and “opposes
providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive services required to be
covered ... on account of religious objections.” To qualify for this
accommodation, an employer must certify that it is such an organization. When
a group-health-insurance issuer receives notice that one of its clients has
invoked this provision, the issuer must then exclude contraceptive coverage
from the employer’s plan and provide separate payments for contraceptive
services for plan participants without imposing any cost-sharing requirements
on the eligible organization, its insurance plan, or its employee beneficiaries.
Although this procedure requires the issuer to bear the cost of these services,
HHS has determined that this obligation will not impose any net expense on
issuers because its cost will be less than or equal to the cost savings resulting
from the services.
In addition to these exemptions for religious organizations, ACA exempts a great
many employers from most of its coverage requirements. Employers providing
“grandfathered health plans”—those that existed prior to March 23, 2010, and
that have not made specified changes after that date—need not comply with

Robson

1129

The First Amendment

many of the Act’s requirements, including the contraceptive mandate. And
employers with fewer than 50 employees are not required to provide health
insurance at all.
All told, the contraceptive mandate “presently does not apply to tens of millions
of people.” This is attributable, in large part, to grandfathered health plans:
Over one-third of the 149 million nonelderly people in America with employersponsored health plans were enrolled in grandfathered plans in 2013. The
count for employees working for firms that do not have to provide insurance at
all because they employ fewer than 50 employees is 34 million workers.

A
Norman and Elizabeth Hahn and their three sons are devout members of the
Mennonite Church, a Christian denomination. The Mennonite Church opposes
abortion and believes that “[t]he fetus in its earliest stages ... shares humanity
with those who conceived it.”
Fifty years ago, Norman Hahn started a wood-working business in his garage,
and since then, this company, Conestoga Wood Specialties, has grown and now
has 950 employees. Conestoga is organized under Pennsylvania law as a forprofit corporation. The Hahns exercise sole ownership of the closely held
business; they control its board of directors and hold all of its voting shares.
One of the Hahn sons serves as the president and CEO.
The Hahns believe that they are required to run their business “in accordance
with their religious beliefs and moral principles.” To that end, the company’s
mission, as they see it, is to “operate in a professional environment founded
upon the highest ethical, moral, and Christian principles.” (internal quotation
marks omitted). The company’s “Vision and Values Statements” affirms that
Conestoga endeavors to “ensur[e] a reasonable profit in [a] manner that reflects
[the Hahns’] Christian heritage.”
As explained in Conestoga’s board-adopted “Statement on the Sanctity of
Human Life,” the Hahns believe that “human life begins at conception.” It is
therefore “against [their] moral conviction to be involved in the termination of
human life” after conception, which they believe is a “sin against God to which
they are held accountable.” The Hahns have accordingly excluded from the
group-health-insurance plan they offer to their employees certain contraceptive
methods that they consider to be abortifacients.
The Hahns and Conestoga sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies
under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, seeking to
enjoin application of ACA’s contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them to
provide health-insurance coverage for four FDA-approved contraceptives that
may operate after the fertilization of an egg. These include two forms of
emergency contraception commonly called “morning after” pills and two types of
intrauterine devices.
In opposing the requirement to provide coverage for the contraceptives to which
they object, the Hahns argued that “it is immoral and sinful for [them] to
intentionally participate in, pay for, facilitate, or otherwise support these drugs.”
The District Court denied a preliminary injunction, and the Third Circuit

Robson

1130

The First Amendment

affirmed in a divided opinion, holding that “for-profit, secular corporations
cannot engage in religious exercise” within the meaning of RFRA or the First
Amendment. The Third Circuit also rejected the claims brought by the Hahns
themselves because it concluded that the HHS “[m]andate does not impose any
requirements on the Hahns” in their personal capacity.
B
David and Barbara Green and their three children are Christians who own and
operate two family businesses. Forty-five years ago, David Green started an
arts-and-crafts store that has grown into a nationwide chain called Hobby
Lobby. There are now 500 Hobby Lobby stores, and the company has more than
13,000 employees. Hobby Lobby is organized as a for-profit corporation under
Oklahoma law.
One of David’s sons started an affiliated business, Mardel, which operates 35
Christian bookstores and employs close to 400 people. Mardel is also organized
as a for-profit corporation under Oklahoma law.
Though these two businesses have expanded over the years, they remain closely
held, and David, Barbara, and their children retain exclusive control of both
companies. David serves as the CEO of Hobby Lobby, and his three children
serve as the president, vice president, and vice CEO.
Hobby Lobby’s statement of purpose commits the Greens to “[h]onoring the
Lord in all [they] do by operating the company in a manner consistent with
Biblical principles.” Each family member has signed a pledge to run the
businesses in accordance with the family’s religious beliefs and to use the
family assets to support Christian ministries. In accordance with those
commitments, Hobby Lobby and Mardel stores close on Sundays, even though
the Greens calculate that they lose millions in sales annually by doing so. The
businesses refuse to engage in profitable transactions that facilitate or promote
alcohol use; they contribute profits to Christian missionaries and ministries;
and they buy hundreds of full-page newspaper ads inviting people to “know
Jesus as Lord and Savior.”
Like the Hahns, the Greens believe that life begins at conception and that it
would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices
that operate after that point. They specifically object to the same four
contraceptive methods as the Hahns and, like the Hahns, they have no
objection to the other 16 FDA-approved methods of birth control. Although their
group-health-insurance plan predates the enactment of ACA, it is not a
grandfathered plan because Hobby Lobby elected not to retain grandfathered
status before the contraceptive mandate was proposed.
The Greens, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel sued HHS and other federal agencies
and officials to challenge the contraceptive mandate under RFRA and the Free
Exercise Clause. The District Court denied a preliminary injunction, and the
plaintiffs appealed, moving for initial en banc consideration. The Tenth Circuit
granted that motion and reversed in a divided opinion. Contrary to the
conclusion of the Third Circuit, the Tenth Circuit held that the Greens’ two forprofit businesses are “persons” within the meaning of RFRA and therefore may
bring suit under that law.

Robson

1131

The First Amendment

The court then held that the corporations had established a likelihood of
success on their RFRA claim. The court concluded that the contraceptive
mandate substantially burdened the exercise of religion by requiring the
companies to choose between “compromis[ing] their religious beliefs” and
paying a heavy fee—either “close to $475 million more in taxes every year” if
they simply refused to provide coverage for the contraceptives at issue, or
“roughly $26 million” annually if they “drop[ped] health-insurance benefits for
all employees.”
The court next held that HHS had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in
enforcing the mandate against the Greens’ businesses and, in the alternative,
that HHS had failed to prove that enforcement of the mandate was the “least
restrictive means” of furthering the Government’s asserted interests. After
concluding that the companies had “demonstrated irreparable harm,” the court
reversed and remanded for the District Court to consider the remaining factors
of the preliminary-injunction test.
We granted certiorari.
III
A
RFRA prohibits the “Government [from] substantially burden[ing] a person’s
exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability”
unless the Government “demonstrates that application of the burden to the
person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is
the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.”
42 U.S.C.§§2000bb–1(a), (b) (emphasis added). The first question that we must
address is whether this provision applies to regulations that govern the
activities of for-profit corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel.
HHS contends that neither these companies nor their owners can even be heard
under RFRA. According to HHS, the companies cannot sue because they seek to
make a profit for their owners, and the owners cannotbe heard because the
regulations, at least as a formal matter, apply only to the companies and not to
the ownersas individuals. HHS’s argument would have dramatic consequences.
Consider this Court’s decision in Braunfeld v. Brown (1961) (plurality opinion).
In that case, five Orthodox Jewish merchants who ran small retail businesses
in Philadelphia challenged a Pennsylvania Sunday closing law as a violation of
the Free Exercise Clause. Because of their faith, these merchants closed their
shops on Saturday, and they argued that requiring them to remain shut on
Sunday threatened them with financial ruin. The Court entertained their claim
(although it ruled against them on the merits), and if a similar claim were raised
today under RFRA against a jurisdiction still subject to the Act, the merchants
would be entitled to be heard. According to HHS, however, if these merchants
chose to incorporate their businesses—without in any way changing the size or
nature of their businesses—they would forfeit all RFRA (and free-exercise) rights.
HHS would put these merchants to a difficult choice: either give up the right to
seek judicial protection of their religious liberty or forgo the benefits, available
to their competitors, of operating as corporations.
As we have seen, RFRA was designed to provide very broad protection for
religious liberty. By enacting RFRA, Congress went far beyond what this Court

Robson

1132

The First Amendment

has held is constitutionally required. Is there any reason to think that the
Congress that enacted such sweeping protection put small-business owners to
the choice that HHS suggests? An examination of RFRA’s text, to which we turn
in the next part of this opinion, reveals that Congress did no such thing.
As we will show, Congress provided protection for people like the Hahns and
Greens by employing a familiar legal fiction: It included corporations within
RFRA’s definition of “persons.” But it is important to keep in mind that the
purpose of this fiction is to provide protection for human beings. A corporation
is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends.
***
Corporations, “separate and apart from” the human beings who own, run, and
are employed by them, cannot do anything at all.
B
1
*** Under the Dictionary Act, “the wor[d] ‘person’ ... include[s] corporations,
companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock
companies, as well as individuals.” ; Thus, unless there is something about the
RFRA context that “indicates otherwise,” the Dictionary Act provides a quick,
clear, and affirmative answer to the question whether the companies involved in
these cases may be heard. ***
2
The principal argument advanced by HHS and the principal dissent regarding
RFRA protection for Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel focuses not on the
statutory term “person,” but on the phrase “exercise of religion.” According to
HHS and the dissent, these corporations are not protected by RFRA because
they cannot exercise religion. Neither HHS nor the dissent, however, provides
any persuasive explanation for this conclusion.
Is it because of the corporate form? The corporate form alone cannot provide
the explanation because, as we have pointed out, HHS concedes that nonprofit
corporations can be protected by RFRA. The dissent suggests that nonprofit
corporations are special because furthering their religious “autonomy . . . often
furthers individual religious freedom as well.” But this principle applies equally
to for-profit corporations: Furthering their religious freedom also “furthers
individual religious freedom.” In these cases, for example, allowing Hobby Lobby,
Conestoga, and Mardel to assert RFRA claims protects the religious liberty of
the Greens and the Hahns.
If the corporate form is not enough, what about the profit-making objective? In
Braunfeld, we entertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who were
attempting to make a profit as retail merchants, and the Court never even
hinted that this objective precluded their claims. As the Court explained in a
later case, the “exercise of religion” involves “not only belief and profession but
the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts” that are “engaged in for
religious reasons.” Business practices that are compelled or limited by the
tenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably within that definition. Thus, a law
that “operates so as to make the practice of ... religious beliefs more expensive”
in the context of business activities imposes a burden on the exercise of religion.

Robson

1133

The First Amendment

If, as Braunfeld recognized, a sole proprietorship that seeks to make a profit
may assert a free-exercise claim, why can’t Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and
Mardel do the same? ***
HHS would draw a sharp line between nonprofit corporations (which, HHS
concedes, are protected by RFRA) and for-profit corporations (which HHS would
leave unprotected), but the actual picture is less clear-cut. Not all corporations
that decline to organize as nonprofits do so in order to maximize profit. For
example, organizations with religious and charitable aims might organize as forprofit corporations because of the potential advantages of that corporate form,
such as the freedom to participate in lobbying for legislation or campaigning for
political candidates who promote their religious or charitable goals. ***
3
HHS and the principal dissent make one additional argument in an effort to
show that a for-profit corporation cannot engage in the “exercise of religion”
within the meaning of RFRA: HHS argues that RFRA did no more than codify
this Court’s pre-Smith Free Exercise Clause precedents, and because none of
those cases squarely held that a for-profit corporation has free-exercise rights,
RFRA does not confer such protection. This argument has many flaws.
First, nothing in the text of RFRA as originally enacted suggested that the
statutory phrase “exercise of religion under the First Amendment” was meant to
be tied to this Court’s pre-Smith interpretation of that Amendment. ***
Second, if the original text of RFRA was not clear enough on this point—and we
think it was—the amendment of RFRA through RLUIPA surely dispels any
doubt. ***
Third, the one pre-Smith case involving the free-exercise rights of a for-profit
corporation suggests, if anything, that for-profit corporations possess such
rights. In Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc. (1961) , the
Massachusetts Sunday closing law was challenged by a kosher market that was
organized as a for-profit corporation, by customers of the market, and by a
rabbi. The Commonwealth argued that the corporation lacked “standing” to
assert a free-exercise claim, but not one member of the Court expressed
agreement with that argument. The plurality opinion for four Justices rejected
the First Amendment claim on the merits based on the reasoning in Braunfeld,
and reserved decision on the question whether the corporation had “standing”
to raise the claim. The three dissenters, Justices Douglas, Brennan, and
Stewart, found the law unconstitutional as applied to the corporation and the
other challengers and thus implicitly recognized their right to assert a freeexercise claim. Finally, Justice Frankfurter’s opinion, which was joined by
Justice Harlan, upheld the Massachusetts law on the merits but did not
question or reserve decision on the issue of the right of the corporation or any
of the other challengers to be heard. It is quite a stretch to argue that RFRA, a
law enacted to provide very broad protection for religious liberty, left for-profit
corporations unprotected simply because in Gallagher—the only pre-Smith case
in which the issue was raised—a majority of the Justices did not find it
necessary to decide whether the kosher market’s corporate status barred it
from raising a free-exercise claim.

Robson

1134

The First Amendment

Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA merely restored this Court’s preSmith decisions in ossified form and did not allow a plaintiff to raise a RFRA
claim unless that plaintiff fell within a category of plaintiffs one of whom had
brought a free-exercise claim that this Court entertained in the years before
Smith. For example, we are not aware of any pre-Smith case in which this Court
entertained a free-exercise claim brought by a resident noncitizen. Are such
persons also beyond RFRA’s protective reach simply because the Court never
addressed their rights before Smith? ***
4
Finally, HHS contends that Congress could not have wanted RFRA to apply to
for-profit corporations because it is difficult as a practical matter to ascertain
the sincere “beliefs” of a corporation. HHS goes so far as to raise the specter of
“divisive, polarizing proxy battles over the religious identity of large, publicly
traded corporations such as IBM or General Electric.”
These cases, however, do not involve publicly traded corporations, and it seems
unlikely that the sort of corporate giants to which HHS refers will often assert
RFRA claims.***
For all these reasons, we hold that a federal regulation’s restriction on the
activities of a for-profit closely held corporation must comply with RFRA.
IV
Because RFRA applies in these cases, we must next ask whether the HHS
contraceptive mandate “substantially burden[s]” the exercise of religion. 42
U.S.C. §2000bb–1(a). We have little trouble concluding that it does.
A
As we have noted, the Hahns and Greens have a sincere religious belief that life
begins at conception. They therefore object on religious grounds to providing
health insurance that covers methods of birth control that, as HHS
acknowledges, may result in the destruction of an embryo. By requiring the
Hahns and Greens and their companies to arrange for such coverage, the HHS
mandate demands that they engage in conduct that seriously violates their
religious beliefs.
If the Hahns and Greens and their companies do not yield to this demand, the
economic consequences will be severe. If the companies continue to offer group
health plans that do not cover the contraceptives at issue, they will be taxed
$100 per day for each affected individual. For Hobby Lobby, the bill could
amount to $1.3 million per day or about $475 million per year; for Conestoga,
the assessment could be $90,000 per day or $33 million per year; and for
Mardel, it could be $40,000 per day or about $15 million per year. These sums
are surely substantial.
It is true that the plaintiffs could avoid these assessments by dropping
insurance coverage altogether and thus forcing their employees to obtain health
insurance on one of the exchanges established under ACA. But if at least one of
their full-time employees were to qualify for a subsidy on one of the
government-run exchanges, this course would also entail substantial economic
consequences. The companies could face penalties of $2,000 per employee each
year. These penalties would amount to roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby,
$1.8 million for Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel.

Robson

1135

The First Amendment

B
Although these totals are high, amici supporting HHS have suggested that the
$2,000 per-employee penalty is actually less than the average cost of providing
health insurance, and therefore, they claim, the companies could readily
eliminate any substantial burden by forcing their employees to obtain
insurance in the government exchanges. We do not generally entertain
arguments that were not raised below and are not advanced in this Court by
any party.***
Even if we were to reach this argument, we would find it unpersuasive. As an
initial matter, it entirely ignores the fact that the Hahns and Greens and their
companies have religious reasons for providing health-insurance coverage for
their employees. Before the advent of ACA, they were not legally compelled to
provide insurance, but they nevertheless did so—in part, no doubt, for
conventional business reasons, but also in part because their religious beliefs
govern their relations with their employees. ***

In taking the position that the HHS mandate does not impose a substantial
burden on the exercise of religion, HHS’s main argument (echoed by the
principal dissent) is basically that the connection between what the objecting
parties must do (provide health-insurance coverage for four methods of
contraception that may operate after the fertilization of an egg) and the end that
they find to be morally wrong (destruction of an embryo) is simply too
attenuated. HHS and the dissent note that providing the coverage would not
itself result in the destruction of an embryo; that would occur only if an
employee chose to take advantage of the coverage and to use one of the four
methods at issue.
This argument dodges the question that RFRA presents (whether the HHS
mandate imposes a substantial burden on the ability of the objecting parties to
conduct business in accordance with their religious beliefs) and instead
addresses a very different question that the federal courts have no business
addressing (whether the religious belief asserted in a RFRA case is reasonable).
The Hahns and Greens believe that providing the coverage demanded by the
HHS regulations is connected to the destruction of an embryo in a way that is
sufficient to make it immoral for them to provide the coverage. This belief
implicates a difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy,
namely, the circumstances under which it is wrong for a person to perform an
act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the
commission of an immoral act by another. Arrogating the authority to provide a
binding national answer to this religious and philosophical question, HHS and
the principal dissent in effect tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are flawed. For
good reason, we have repeatedly refused to take such a step. ***
V
Since the HHS contraceptive mandate imposes a substantial burden on the
exercise of religion, we must move on and decide whether HHS has shown that
the mandate both “(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest;
and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental
interest.”
A

Robson

1136

The First Amendment

HHS asserts that the contraceptive mandate serves a variety of important
interests, but many of these are couched in very broad terms, such as
promoting “public health” and “gender equality.” RFRA, however, contemplates
a “more focused” inquiry: It “requires the Government to demonstrate that the
compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law ‘to
the person’—the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being
substantially burdened.” O’Centro. This requires us to “loo[k] beyond broadly
formulated interests” and to “scrutiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting specific
exemptions to particular religious claimants”—in other words, to look to the
marginal interest in enforcing the contraceptive mandate in these cases. O
Centro.
In addition to asserting these very broadly framed interests, HHS maintains
that the mandate serves a compelling interest in ensuring that all women have
access to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing. *** [But] As we
have noted, many employees—those covered by grandfathered plans and those
who work for employers with fewer than 50 employees—may have no
contraceptive coverage without cost sharing at all.
HHS responds that many legal requirements have exceptions and the existence
of exceptions does not in itself indicate that the principal interest served by a
law is not compelling. Even a compelling interest may be outweighed in some
circumstances by another even weightier consideration. In these cases, however,
the interest served by one of the biggest exceptions, the exception for
grandfathered plans, is simply the interest of employers in avoiding the
inconvenience of amending an existing plan. Grandfathered plans are required
“to comply with a subset of the Affordable Care Act’s health reform provisions”
that provide what HHS has described as “particularly significant protections.”
But the contraceptive mandate is expressly excluded from this subset.
We find it unnecessary to adjudicate this issue. We will assume that the
interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive
methods is compelling within the meaning of RFRA, and we will proceed to
consider the final prong of the RFRA test, i.e., whether HHS has shown that the
contraceptive mandate is “the least restrictive means of furthering that
compelling governmental interest.”
B
The least-restrictive-means standard is exceptionally demanding, see City of
Boerne, and it is not satisfied here. HHS has not shown that it lacks other
means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on
the exercise of religion by the objecting parties in these cases.
The most straightforward way of doing this would be for the Government to
assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives at issue to any women who
are unable to obtain them under their health-insurance policies due to their
employers’ religious objections. This would certainly be less restrictive of the
plaintiffs’ religious liberty, and HHS has not shown, that this is not a viable
alternative. HHS has not provided any estimate of the average cost per
employee of providing access to these contraceptives, two of which, according to
the FDA, are designed primarily for emergency use. Nor has HHS provided any
statistics regarding the number of employees who might be affected because

Robson

1137

The First Amendment

they work for corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel. Nor has
HHS told us that it is unable to provide such statistics. It seems likely, however,
that the cost of providing the forms of contraceptives at issue in these cases (if
not all FDA-approved contraceptives) would be minor when compared with the
overall cost of ACA. According to one of the Congressional Budget Office’s most
recent forecasts, ACA’s insurance-coverage provisions will cost the Federal
Government more than $1.3 trillion through the next decade. If, as HHS tells us,
providing all women with cost-free access to all FDA-approved methods of
contraception is a Government interest of the highest order, it is hard to
understand HHS’s argument that it cannot be required under RFRA to pay
anything in order to achieve this important goal.
HHS contends that RFRA does not permit us to take this option into account
because “RFRA cannot be used to require creation of entirely new programs.”
But we see nothing in RFRA that supports this argument, and drawing the line
between the “creation of an entirely new program” and the modification of an
existing program (which RFRA surely allows) would be fraught with problems.
We do not doubt that cost may be an important factor in the least-restrictivemeans analysis, but both RFRA and its sister statute, RLUIPA, may in some
circumstances require the Government to expend additional funds to
accommodate citizens’ religious beliefs. HHS’s view that RFRA can never require
the Government to spend even a small amount reflects a judgment about the
importance of religious liberty that was not shared by the Congress that
enacted that law.
In the end, however, we need not rely on the option of a new, governmentfunded program in order to conclude that the HHS regulations fail the leastrestrictive-means test. HHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its disposal
an approach that is less restrictive than requiring employers to fund
contraceptive methods that violate their religious beliefs. As we explained above,
HHS has already established an accommodation for nonprofit organizations
with religious objections. Under that accommodation, the organization can selfcertify that it opposes providing coverage for particular contraceptive services. If
the organization makes such a certification, the organization’s insurance issuer
or third-party administrator must “[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive coverage
from the group health insurance coverage provided in connection with the
group health plan” and “[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive
services required to be covered” without imposing “any cost-sharing
requirements ... on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan
participants or beneficiaries.”
We do not decide today whether an approach of this type complies with RFRA
for purposes of all religious claims. At a minimum, however, it does not impinge
on the plaintiffs’ religious belief that providing insurance coverage for the
contraceptives at issue here violates their religion, and it serves HHS’s stated
interests equally well.
The principal dissent identifies no reason why this accommodation would fail to
protect the asserted needs of women as effectively as the contraceptive mandate,
and there is none. ***
C

Robson

1138

The First Amendment

HHS and the principal dissent argue that a ruling in favor of the objecting
parties in these cases will lead to a flood of religious objections regarding a wide
variety of medical procedures and drugs, such as vaccinations and blood
transfusions, but HHS has made no effort to substantiate this prediction. ***
In any event, our decision in these cases is concerned solely with the
contraceptive mandate. Our decision should not be understood to hold that an
insurance-coverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an
employer’s religious beliefs. Other coverage requirements, such as
immunizations, may be supported by different interests (for example, the need
to combat the spread of infectious diseases) and may involve different
arguments about the least restrictive means of providing them.
The principal dissent raises the possibility that discrimination in hiring, for
example on the basis of race, might be cloaked as religious practice to escape
legal sanction. Our decision today provides no such shield. The Government
has a compelling interest in providing an equal opportunity to participate in the
workforce without regard to race, and prohibitions on racial discrimination are
precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal.
HHS also raises for the first time in this Court the argument that applying the
contraceptive mandate to for-profit employers with sincere religious objections
is essential to the comprehensive health-insurance scheme that ACA
establishes. HHS analogizes the contraceptive mandate to the requirement to
pay Social Security taxes, which we upheld in Lee despite the religious
objection of an employer, but these cases are quite different. ***
Lee was a free-exercise, not a RFRA, case, but if the issue in Lee were analyzed
under the RFRA framework, the fundamental point would be that there simply
is no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay taxes. ***
***Congress, in enacting RFRA, took the position that “the compelling interest
test as set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a workable test for striking
sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental
interests.” 42 U.S.C. §2000bb(a)(5). The wisdom of Congress’s judgment on this
matter is not our concern. Our responsibility is to enforce RFRA as written, and
under the standard that RFRA prescribes, the HHS contraceptive mandate is
unlawful.
The contraceptive mandate, as applied to closely held corporations, violates
RFRA. Our decision on that statutory question makes it unnecessary to reach
the First Amendment claim raised by Conestoga and the Hahns.
The judgment of the Tenth Circuit in No. 13–354 is affirmed; the judgment of
the Third Circuit in No. 13–356 is reversed, and that case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, CONCURRING.
It seems to me appropriate, in joining the Court’s opinion, to add these few
remarks. At the outset it should be said that the Court’s opinion does not have
the breadth and sweep ascribed to it by the respectful and powerful dissent.
Robson

1139

The First Amendment

The Court and the dissent disagree on the proper interpretation of the Religious
Freedom and Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), but do agree on the purpose of
that statute. It is to ensure that interests in religious freedom are protected.
*** Among the reasons the United States is so open, so tolerant, and so free is
that no person may be restricted or demeaned by government in exercising his
or her religion. Yet neither may that same exercise unduly restrict other
persons, such as employees, in protecting their own interests, interests the law
deems compelling. In these cases the means to reconcile those two priorities are
at hand in the existing accommodation the Government has designed, identified,
and used for circumstances closely parallel to those presented here. RFRA
requires the Government to use this less restrictive means. As the Court
explains, this existing model, designed precisely for this problem, might well
suffice to distinguish the instant cases from many others in which it is more
difficult and expensive to accommodate a governmental program to countless
religious claims based on an alleged statutory right of free exercise.
For these reasons and others put forth by the Court, I join its opinion.
JUSTICE BREYER AND JUSTICE KAGAN, DISSENTING.
We agree with Justice Ginsburg that the plaintiffs’ challenge to the
contraceptive coverage requirement fails on the merits. We need not and do not
decide whether either for-profit corporations or their owners may bring claims
under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. Accordingly, we join all
but Part III–C–1 of Justice Ginsburg’s dissenting opinion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG, WITH WHOM JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR JOINS, AND WITH WHOM
JUSTICE BREYER AND JUSTICE KAGAN JOIN AS TO ALL BUT PART III–C–1, DISSENTING.
In a decision of startling breadth, the Court holds that commercial enterprises,
including corporations, along with partnerships and sole proprietorships, can
opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their
sincerely held religious beliefs. Compelling governmental interests in uniform
compliance with the law, and disadvantages that religion-based opt-outs
impose on others, hold no sway, the Court decides, at least when there is a
“less restrictive alternative.” And such an alternative, the Court suggests, there
always will be whenever, in lieu of tolling an enterprise claiming a religionbased exemption, the government, i.e., the general public, can pick up the tab.
The Court does not pretend that the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause
demands religion-based accommodations so extreme, for our decisions leave no
doubt on that score. Instead, the Court holds that Congress, in the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), dictated the extraordinary religionbased exemptions today’s decision endorses. In the Court’s view, RFRA
demands accommodation of a for-profit corporation’s religious beliefs no matter
the impact that accommodation may have on third parties who do not share the
corporation owners’ religious faith—in these cases, thousands of women
employed by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga or dependents of persons those
corporations employ. Persuaded that Congress enacted RFRA to serve a far less
radical purpose, and mindful of the havoc the Court’s judgment can introduce, I
dissent.

The First Amendment

I
“The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of
the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.”
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey (1992) . Congress acted on that
understanding when, as part of a nationwide insurance program intended to be
comprehensive, it called for coverage of preventive care responsive to women’s
needs. Carrying out Congress’ direction, the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), in consultation with public health experts, promulgated
regulations requiring group health plans to cover all forms of contraception
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The genesis of this
coverage should enlighten the Court’s resolution of these cases.
A
The Affordable Care Act (ACA), in its initial form, specified three categories of
preventive care that health plans must cover at no added cost to the plan
participant or beneficiary. Particular services were to be recommended by the
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts. The
scheme had a large gap, how-ever; it left out preventive services that “many
women’s health advocates and medical professionals believe are critically
important.” (statement of Sen. Boxer). To correct this oversight, Senator
Barbara Mikulski introduced the Women’s Health Amendment, which added to
the ACA’s minimum coverage requirements a new category of preventive
services specific to women’s health.
Women paid significantly more than men for preventive care, the amendment’s
proponents noted; in fact, cost barriers operated to block many women from
obtaining needed care at all. (statement of Sen. Feinstein) (“Women of
childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than
men.”); (statement of Sen. Mikulski) (“copayments are [often] so high that
[women] avoid getting [preventive and screening services] in the first place”).
And increased access to contraceptive services, the sponsors comprehended,
would yield important public health gains. (statement of Sen. Durbin) (“This bill
will expand health insurance coverage to the vast majority of [the 17 million
women of reproductive age in the United States who are uninsured] .... This
expanded access will reduce unintended pregnancies.”).
As altered by the Women’s Health Amendment’s passage, the ACA requires new
insurance plans to include coverage without cost sharing of “such additional
preventive care and screenings ... as provided for in comprehensive guidelines
supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration [(HRSA)],” a
unit of HHS. Thus charged, the HRSA developed recommendations in
consultation with the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The IOM convened a group of
independent experts, including “specialists in disease prevention [and] women’s
health”; those experts prepared a report evaluating the efficacy of a number of
preventive services. Consistent with the findings of “[n]umerous health
professional associations” and other organizations, the IOM experts determined
that preventive coverage should include the “full range” of FDA-approved
contraceptive methods.
In making that recommendation, the IOM’s report expressed concerns similar to
those voiced by congressional proponents of the Women’s Health Amendment.
The report noted the disproportionate burden women carried for comprehensive

Robson

1141

The First Amendment

health services and the adverse health consequences of excluding contraception
from preventive care available to employees without cost sharing. (“[W]omen are
consistently more likely than men to report a wide range of cost-related barriers
to receiving ... medical tests and treatments and to filling prescriptions for
themselves and their families.”); (pregnancy may be contraindicated forwomen
with certain medical conditions, for example, some congenital heart diseases,
pulmonary hypertension, and Marfan syndrome, and contraceptives may be
used to reduce risk of endometrial cancer, among other serious medical
conditions); (women with unintended pregnancies are more likely to experience
depression and anxiety, and their children face “increased odds of preterm birth
and low birth weight”).
In line with the IOM’s suggestions, the HRSA adopted guidelines recommending
coverage of “[a]ll [FDA-]approved contraceptive methods, sterilization
procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with
reproductive capacity.” Thereafter, HHS, the Department of Labor, and the
Department of Treasury promulgated regulations requiring group health plans
to include coverage of the contraceptive services recommended in the HRSA
guidelines, subject to certain exceptions. This opinion refers to these
regulations as the contraceptive coverage requirement.
B
While the Women’s Health Amendment succeeded, a countermove proved
unavailing. The Senate voted down the so-called “conscience amendment,”
which would have enabled any employer or insurance provider to deny coverage
based on its asserted “religious beliefs or moral convictions.” That amendment,
Senator Mikulski observed, would have “pu[t] the personal opinion of employers
and insurers over the practice of medicine.” Rejecting the “conscience
amendment,” Congress left health care decisions—including the choice among
contraceptive methods—in the hands of women, with the aid of their health
care providers.
II
Any First Amendment Free Exercise Clause claim Hobby Lobby or Conestoga
might assert is foreclosed by this Court’s decision in Employment Div., Dept. of
Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith (1990) . In Smith ***
Even if Smith did not control, the Free Exercise Clause would not require the
exemption Hobby Lobby and Conestoga seek. Accommodations to religious
beliefs or observances, the Court has clarified, must not significantly impinge
on the interests of third parties.
The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga would override
significant interests of the corporations’ employees and covered dependents. It
would deny legions of women who do not hold their employers’ beliefs access to
contraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure. In sum, with
respect to free exercise claims no less than free speech claims, “‘[y]our right to
swing your arms ends just where the other man’s nose begins.’” Chafee,
Freedom of Speech in War Time, 32 Harv. L.Rev. 932, 957 (1919).

III

Robson

1142

The First Amendment

A
Lacking a tenable claim under the Free Exercise Clause, Hobby Lobby and
Conestoga rely on RFRA, a statute instructing that “[g]overnment shall not
substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results
from a rule of general applicability” unless the government shows that
application of the burden is “the least restrictive means” to further a
“compelling governmental interest.” In RFRA, Congress “adopt[ed] a statutory
rule comparable to the constitutional rule rejected in Smith.” Gonzales v. O
Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal (2006) .
RFRA’s purpose is specific and written into the statute itself. *** In line with
this restorative purpose, Congress expected courts considering RFRA claims to
“look to free exercise cases decided prior to Smith for guidance.” In short, the
Act reinstates the law as it was prior to Smith, without “creat[ing] ... new rights
for any religious practice or for any potential litigant.” (statement of Sen.
Kennedy). Given the Act’s moderate purpose, it is hardly surprising that RFRA’s
enactment in 1993 provoked little controversy. (RFRA was approved by a 97-to3 vote in the Senate and a voice vote in the House of Representatives).
B
Despite these authoritative indications, the Court sees RFRA as a bold initiative
departing from, rather than restoring, pre-Smith jurisprudence. To support its
conception of RFRA as a measure detached from this Court’s decisions, one
that sets a new course, the Court points first to the Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA) ***
Next, the Court highlights RFRA’s requirement that the government, if its action
substantially burdens a person’s religious observance, must demonstrate that it
chose the least restrictive means for furthering a compelling interest. “[B]y
imposing a least-restrictive-means test,” the Court suggests, RFRA “went
beyond what was required by our pre-Smith decisions.”
But as RFRA’s
statements of purpose and legislative history make clear, Congress intended
only to restore, not to scrap or alter, the balancing test as this Court had
applied it pre-Smith. Senate Report (RFRA’s “compelling interest test generally
should not be construed more stringently or more leniently than it was prior to
Smith.”); House Report (same).
The Congress that passed RFRA correctly read this Court’s pre-Smith case law
as including within the “compelling interest test” a “least restrictive means”
requirement. ***
Our decision in City of Boerne, it is true, states that the least restrictive means
requirement “was not used in the pre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA purported to
codify.” As just indicated, however, that statement does not accurately convey
the Court’s pre-Smith jurisprudence.
C
With RFRA’s restorative purpose in mind, I turn to the Act’s application to the
instant lawsuits. That task, in view of the positions taken by the Court, requires
consideration of several questions, each potentially dispositive of Hobby Lobby’s
and Conestoga’s claims: Do for-profit corporations rank among “person[s]” who
“exercise ... religion”? Assuming that they do, does the contraceptive coverage
requirement “substantially burden” their religious exercise? If so, is the

Robson

1143

The First Amendment

requirement “in furtherance of a compelling government interest”? And last,
does the requirement represent the least restrictive means for furthering that
interest?
Misguided by its errant premise that RFRA moved beyond the pre-Smith case
law, the Court falters at each step of its analysis.
1
RFRA’s compelling interest test, as noted, applies to government actions that
“substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion.” This reference, the Court
submits, incorporates the definition of “person” found in the Dictionary Act, 1
U.S.C. §1, which extends to “corporations, companies, associations, firms,
partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals.” The
Dictionary Act’s definition, however, controls only where “context” does not
“indicat[e] otherwise.” Here, context does so indicate. RFRA speaks of “a
person’s exercise of religion.” Whether a corporation qualifies as a “person”
capable of exercising religion is an inquiry one cannot answer without reference
to the “full body” of pre-Smith “free-exercise caselaw.” There is in that case law
no support for the notion that free exercise rights pertain to for-profit
corporations.
Until this litigation, no decision of this Court recognized a for-profit
corporation’s qualification for a religious exemption from a generally applicable
law, whether under the Free Exercise Clause or RFRA. The absence of such
precedent is just what one would expect, for the exercise of religion is
characteristic of natural persons, not artificial legal entities. As Chief Justice
Marshall observed nearly two centuries ago, a corporation is “an artificial being,
invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law.” Trustees of
Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1819). Corporations, Justice Stevens more
recently reminded, “have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts,
no desires.” Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n, (2010) (opinion
concurring in part and dissenting in part).
The First Amendment’s free exercise protections, the Court has indeed
recognized, shelter churches and other nonprofit religion-based organizations.
*** The Court’s “special solicitude to the rights of religious organizations,”
Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC (2012) however,
is just that. No such solicitude is traditional for commercial organizations.
Indeed, until today, religious exemptions had never been extended to any entity
operating in “the commercial, profit-making world.”
The reason why is hardly obscure. Religious organizations exist to foster the
interests of persons subscribing to the same religious faith. Not so of for-profit
corporations. Workers who sustain the operations of those corporations
commonly are not drawn from one religious community. Indeed, by law, no
religion-based criterion can restrict the work force of for-profit corporations.
(Title VII requires reasonable accommodation of an employee’s religious exercise,
but such accommodation must not come “at the expense of other[ employees]”).
The distinction between a community made up of believers in the same religion
and one embracing persons of diverse beliefs, clear as it is, constantly escapes
the Court’s attention. One can only wonder why the Court shuts this key
difference from sight.

Robson

1144

The First Amendment

Reading RFRA, as the Court does, to require extension of religion-based
exemptions to for-profit corporations surely is not grounded in the pre-Smith
precedent Congress sought to preserve. Had Congress intended RFRA to initiate
a change so huge, a clarion statement to that effect likely would have been
made in the legislation. ***
The Court notes that for-profit corporations may support charitable causes and
use their funds for religious ends, and therefore questions the distinction
between such corporations and religious nonprofit organizations. Again, the
Court forgets that religious organizations exist to serve a community of
believers. For-profit corporations do not fit that bill. Moreover, history is not on
the Court’s side. Recognition of the discrete characters of “ecclesiastical and lay”
corporations dates back to Blackstone (1765), and was reiterated by this Court
centuries before the enactment of the Internal Revenue Code. To reiterate, “forprofit corporations are different from religious non-profits in that they use labor
to make a profit, rather than to perpetuate [the] religious value[s] [shared by a
community of believers].” ***
The Court’s determination that RFRA extends to for-profit corporations is
bound to have untoward effects. Although the Court attempts to cabin its
language to closely held corporations, its logic extends to corporations of any
size, public or private. Little doubt that RFRA claims will proliferate, for the
Court’s expansive notion of corporate personhood—combined with its other
errorsin construing RFRA—invites for-profit entities to seek religion-based
exemptions from regulations they deem offensive to their faith.
2
Even if Hobby Lobby and Conestoga were deemed RFRA “person[s],” to gain an
exemption, they must demonstrate that the contraceptive coverage requirement
“substantially burden[s] [their] exercise of religion.” Congress no doubt meant
the modifier “substantially” to carry weight. In the original draft of RFRA, the
word “burden” appeared unmodified. The word “substantially” was inserted
pursuant to a clarifying amendment offered by Senators Kennedy and Hatch. In
proposing the amendment, Senator Kennedy stated that RFRA, in accord with
the Court’s pre-Smith case law, “does not require the Government to justify
every action that has some effect on religious exercise.”
The Court barely pauses to inquire whether any burden imposed by the
contraceptive coverage requirement is substantial. Instead, it rests on the
Greens’ and Hahns’ “belie[f] that providing the coverage demanded by the HHS
regulations is connected to the destruction of an embryo in a way that is
sufficient to make it immoral for them to provide the coverage.” I agree with the
Court that the Green and Hahn families’ religious convictions regarding
contraception are sincerely held. But those beliefs, however deeply held, do not
suffice to sustain a RFRA claim. RFRA, properly understood, distinguishes
between “factual allegations that [plaintiffs’] beliefs are sincere and of a religious
nature,” which a court must accept as true, and the “legal conclusion ... that
[plaintiffs’] religious exercise is substantially burdened,” an inquiry the court
must undertake.
That distinction is a facet of the pre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA incorporates.
Bowen v. Roy (1986) is instructive. There, the Court rejected a free exercise

Robson

1145

The First Amendment

challenge to the Government’s use of a Native American child’s Social Security
number for purposes of administering benefit programs. Without questioning
the sincerity of the father’s religious belief that “use of [his daughter’s Social
Security] number may harm [her] spirit,” the Court concluded that the
Government’s internal uses of that number “place[d] [no] restriction on what
[the father] may believe or what he may do.” Recognizing that the father’s
“religious views may not accept” the position that the challenged uses
concerned only the Government’s internal affairs, the Court explained that “for
the adjudication of a constitutional claim, the Constitution, rather than an
individual’s religion, must supply the frame of reference.” Inattentive to this
guidance, today’s decision elides entirely the distinction between the sincerity of
a challenger’s religious belief and the substantiality of the burden placed on the
challenger.
Undertaking the inquiry that the Court forgoes, I would conclude that the
connection between the families’ religious objections and the contraceptive
coverage requirement is too attenuated to rank as substantial. The requirement
carries no command that Hobby Lobby or Conestoga purchase or provide the
contraceptives they find objectionable. Instead, it calls on the companies
covered by the requirement to direct money into undifferentiated funds that
finance a wide variety of benefits under comprehensive health plans. Those
plans, in order to comply with the ACA, must offer contraceptive coverage
without cost sharing, just as they must cover an array of other preventive
services.
Importantly, the decisions whether to claim benefits under the plans are made
not by Hobby Lobby or Cones-toga, but by the covered employees and
dependents, in consultation with their health care providers. Should an
employee of Hobby Lobby or Conestoga share the religious beliefs of the Greens
and Hahns, she is of course under no compulsion to use the contraceptives in
question. But “[n]o individual decision by an employee and her physician—be it
to use contraception, treat an infection, or have a hip replaced—is in any
meaningful sense [her employer’s] decision or action.” It is doubtful that
Congress, when it specified that burdens must be “substantia[l],” had in mind a
linkage thus interrupted by independent decisionmakers (the woman and her
health counselor) standing between the challenged government action and the
religious exercise claimed to be infringed. Any decision to use contraceptives
made by a woman covered under Hobby Lobby’s or Conestoga’s plan will not be
propelled by the Government, it will be the woman’s autonomous choice,
informed by the physician she consults.
3
Even if one were to conclude that Hobby Lobby and Conestoga meet the
substantial burden requirement, the Government has shown that the
contraceptive coverage for which the ACA provides furthers compelling interests
in public health and women’s well being. Those interests are concrete, specific,
and demonstrated by a wealth of empirical evidence. To recapitulate, the
mandated contraception coverage enables women to avoid the health problems
unintended pregnancies may visit on them and their children. The coverage
helps safeguard the health of women for whom pregnancy may be hazardous,

Robson

1146

The First Amendment

even life threatening. And the mandate secures benefits wholly unrelated to
pregnancy, preventing certain cancers, menstrual disorders, and pelvic pain.
That Hobby Lobby and Conestoga resist coverage for only 4 of the 20 FDAapproved contraceptives does not lessen these compelling interests. Notably,
the corporations exclude intrauterine devices (IUDs), devices significantly more
effective, and significantly more expensive than other contraceptive methods.
Moreover, the Court’s reasoning appears to permit commercial enterprises like
Hobby Lobby and Conestoga to exclude from their group health plans all forms
of contraceptives. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 38–39 (counsel for Hobby Lobby
acknowledged that his “argument ... would apply just as well if the employer
said ‘no contraceptives.’”
Perhaps the gravity of the interests at stake has led the Court to assume, for
purposes of its RFRA analysis, that the compelling interest criterion is met in
these cases. It bears note in this regard that the cost of an IUD is nearly
equivalent to a month’s full-time pay for workers earning the minimum wage;
that almost one-third of women would change their contraceptive method if
costs were not a factor; and that only one-fourth of women who request an IUD
actually have one inserted after finding out how expensive it would be.
Stepping back from its assumption that compelling interests support the
contraceptive coverage requirement, the Court notes that small employers and
grandfathered plans are not subject to the requirement. If there is a compelling
interest in contraceptive coverage, the Court suggests, Congress would not have
created these exclusions.
Federal statutes often include exemptions for small employers, and such
provisions have never been held to undermine the interests served by these
statutes. See, e.g., Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (applicable to
employers with 50 or more employees); Age Discrimination in Employment Act
of 1967 (originally exempting employers with fewer than 50 employees, the
statute now governs employers with 20 or more employees); Americans With
Disabilities Act, (applicable to employers with 15 or more employees); Title VII
(originally exempting employers with fewer than 25 employees, the statute now
governs employers with 15 or more employees).
The ACA’s grandfathering provision, allows a phasing-in period for compliance
with a number of the Act’s requirements (not just the contraceptive coverage or
other preventive services provisions). Once specified changes are made,
grandfathered status ceases. Hobby Lobby’s own situation is illustrative. By the
time this litigation commenced, Hobby Lobby did not have grandfathered status.
Asked why by the District Court, Hobby Lobby’s counsel explained that the
“grandfathering requirements mean that you can’t make a whole menu of
changes to your plan that involve things like the amount of co-pays, the
amount of co-insurance, deductibles, that sort of thing.” Counsel acknowledged
that, “just because of economic realities, our plan has to shift over time. I mean,
insurance plans, as everyone knows, shif[t] over time.” The percentage of
employees in grandfathered plans is steadily declining, having dropped from
56% in 2011 to 48% in 2012 to 36% in 2013. In short, far from ranking as a
categorical exemption, the grandfathering provision is “temporary, intended to
be a means for gradually transitioning employers into mandatory coverage.”

The First Amendment

The Court ultimately acknowledges a critical point: RFRA’s application “must
take adequate account of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose
on nonbeneficiaries.” No tradition, and no prior decision under RFRA, allows a
religion-based exemption when the accommodation would be harmful to
others—here, the very persons the contraceptive coverage requirement was
designed to protect.
4
After assuming the existence of compelling government interests, the Court
holds that the contraceptive coverage requirement fails to satisfy RFRA’s least
restrictive means test. But the Government has shown that there is no less
restrictive, equally effective means that would both (1) satisfy the challengers’
religious objections to providing insurance coverage for certain contraceptives
(which they believe cause abortions); and (2) carry out the objective of the ACA’s
contraceptive coverage requirement, to ensure that women employees receive,
at no cost to them, the preventive care needed to safeguard their health and
well being. A “least restrictive means” cannot require employees to relinquish
benefits accorded them by federal law in order to ensure that their commercial
employers can adhere unreservedly to their religious tenets.
Then let the government pay (rather than the employees who do not share their
employer’s faith), the Court suggests. “The most straightforward [alternative],”
the Court asserts, “would be for the Government to assume the cost of
providing ... contraceptives ... to any women who are unable to obtain them
under their health-insurance policies due to their employers’ religious
objections.” The ACA, however, requires coverage of preventive services through
the existing employer-based system of health insurance “so that [employees]
face minimal logistical and administrative obstacles.” Impeding women’s receipt
of benefits “by requiring them to take steps to learn about, and to sign up for, a
new [government funded and administered] health benefit” was scarcely what
Congress contemplated. More-over, Title X of the Public Health Service Act, “is
the nation’s only dedicated source of federal funding for safety net family
planning services.” “Safety net programs like Title X are not designed to absorb
the unmet needs of ... insured individuals.” Note, too, that Congress declined to
write into law the preferential treatment Hobby Lobby and Conestoga describe
as a less restrictive alternative.
And where is the stopping point to the “let the government pay” alternative?
Suppose an employer’s sincerely held religious belief is offended by health
coverage of vaccines, or paying the minimum wage, or according women equal
pay for substantially similar work? Does it rank as a less restrictive alternative
to require the government to provide the money or benefit to which the
employer has a religion-based objection? Because the Court cannot easily
answer that question, it proposes something else: Extension to commercial
enterprises of the accommodation already afforded to nonprofit religion-based
organizations. “At a minimum,” according to the Court, such an approach
would not “impinge on [Hobby Lobby’s and Conestoga’s] religious belief.” I have
already discussed the “special solicitude” generally accorded nonprofit religionbased organizations that exist to serve a community of believers, solicitude
never before accorded to commercial enterprises comprising employees of
diverse faiths.

Robson

1148

The First Amendment

Ultimately, the Court hedges on its proposal to align for-profit enterprises with
nonprofit religion-based organizations. “We do not decide today whether [the]
approach [the opinion advances] complies with RFRA for purposes of all
religious claims.” Counsel for Hobby Lobby was similarly noncommittal. Asked
at oral argument whether the Court-proposed alternative was acceptable,
counsel responded: “We haven’t been offered that accommodation, so we
haven’t had to decide what kind of objection, if any, we would make to that.”
Conestoga suggests that, if its employees had to acquire and pay for the
contraceptives (to which the corporation objects) on their own, a tax credit
would qualify as a less restrictive alternative. A tax credit, of course, is one
variety of “let the government pay.” In addition to departing from the existing
employer-based system of health insurance, Conestoga’s alternative would
require a woman to reach into her own pocket in the first instance, and it would
do nothing for the woman too poor to be aided by a tax credit.
In sum, in view of what Congress sought to accomplish, i.e., comprehensive
preventive care for women furnished through employer-based health plans,
none of the proffered alternatives would satisfactorily serve the compelling
interests to which Congress responded.
IV
Among the pathmarking pre-Smith decisions RFRA preserved is United States v.
Lee (1982). Lee, a sole proprietor engaged in farming and carpentry, was a
member of the Old Order Amish. He sincerely believed that withholding Social
Security taxes from his employees or paying the employer’s share of such taxes
would violate the Amish faith. This Court held that, although the obligations
imposed by the Social Security system conflicted with Lee’s religious beliefs, the
burden was not unconstitutional. The Government urges that Lee should
control the challenges brought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga. In contrast,
today’s Court dismisses Lee as a tax case. Indeed, it was a tax case and the
Court in Lee homed in on “[t]he difficulty in attempting to accommodate
religious beliefs in the area of taxation.”
But the Lee Court made two key points one cannot confine to tax cases. “When
followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of
choice,” the Court observed, “the limits they accept on their own conduct as a
matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on statutory
schemes which are binding on others in that activity.” The statutory scheme of
employer-based comprehensive health coverage involved in these cases is surely
binding on others engaged in the same trade or business as the corporate
challengers here, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga. Further, the Court recognized in
Lee that allowing a religion-based exemption to a commercial employer would
“operat[e] to impose the employer’s religious faith on the employees.” No doubt
the Greens and Hahns and all who share their beliefs may decline to acquire for
themselves the contraceptives in question. But that choice may not be imposed
on employees who hold other beliefs. Working for Hobby Lobby or Conestoga, in
other words, should not deprive employees of the preventive care available to
workers at the shop next door, at least in the absence of directions from the
Legislature or Administration to do so.

Robson

1149

The First Amendment

Why should decisions of this order be made by Congress or the regulatory
authority, and not this Court? Hobby Lobby and Conestoga surely do not stand
alone as commercial enterprises seeking exemptions from generally applicable
laws on the basis of their religious beliefs. [Examples: (owner of restaurant
chain refused to serve black patrons based on his religious beliefs opposing
racial integration); (born-again Christians who owned closely held, for-profit
health clubs believed that the Bible proscribed hiring or retaining an “individual
living with but not married to a person of the opposite sex,” “a young, single
woman working without her father’s consent or a married woman working
without her husband’s consent,” and any person “antagonistic to the Bible,”
including “fornicators and homosexuals”); (for-profit photography business
owned by a husband and wife refused to photograph a lesbian couple’s
commitment ceremony based on the religious beliefs of the company’s owners).]
Would RFRA require exemptions in cases of this ilk? And if not, how does the
Court divine which religious beliefs are worthy of accommodation, and which
are not? Isn’t the Court disarmed from making such a judgment given its
recognition that “courts must not presume to determine ... the plausibility of a
religious claim”?
Would the exemption the Court holds RFRA demands for employers with
religiously grounded objections to the use of certain contraceptives extend to
employers with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions (Jehovah’s
Witnesses); antidepressants (Scientologists); medications derived from pigs,
including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (certain
Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations (Christian Scientists, among
others)? According to counsel for Hobby Lobby, “each one of these cases ...
would have to be evaluated on its own ... apply[ing] the compelling interest-least
restrictive alternative test.” Not much help there for the lower courts bound by
today’s decision.
The Court, however, sees nothing to worry about. Today’s cases, the Court
concludes, are “concerned solely with the contraceptive mandate. Our decision
should not be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must
necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer’s religious beliefs. Other coverage
requirements, such as immunizations, may be supported by different interests
(for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious diseases) and may
involve different arguments about the least restrictive means of providing them.”
But the Court has assumed, for RFRA purposes, that the interest in women’s
health and well being is compelling and has come up with no means adequate
to serve that interest, the one motivating Congress to adopt the Women’s Health
Amendment.
There is an overriding interest, I believe, in keeping the courts “out of the
business of evaluating the relative merits of differing religious claims,” Lee
(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), or the sincerity with which an asserted
religious belief is held. Indeed, approving some religious claims while deeming
others unworthy of accommodation could be “perceived as favoring one religion
over another,” the very “risk the Establishment Clause was designed to
preclude.” The Court, I fear, has ventured into a minefield, by its immoderate
reading of RFRA. I would confine religious exemptions under that Act to
organizations formed “for a religious purpose,” “engage[d] primarily in carrying

Robson

1150

The First Amendment

out that religious purpose,” and not “engaged ... substantially in the exchange
of goods or services for money beyond nominal amounts.”
For the reasons stated, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for
the Tenth Circuit and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit.

	  

B.	  RLUIPA	  
Text	  of	  RLUIPA	  

The ‘‘Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000’’
(RLUIPA) was passed by Congress following the Court’s decision in City of
Boerne v. Flores. As the title indicates, RLUIPA singles out two types of
state actions that it covers: land use (as in City of Boerne) and
institutionalized persons, including prisoners.
42 U.S.C. §2000cc, Protection of land use as religious exercise
(a) Substantial burdens
(1) General rule
No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that
imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person, including a religious
assembly or institution, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the
burden on that person, assembly, or institution—
(A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and
(B) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
(2) Scope of application
This subsection applies in any case in which—
(A) the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal
financial assistance, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability;
(B) the substantial burden affects, or removal of that substantial burden would affect,
commerce with foreign nations, among the several States, or with Indian tribes, even if
the burden results from a rule of general applicability; or
(C) the substantial burden is imposed in the implementation of a land use regulation or
system of land use regulations, under which a government makes, or has in place
formal or informal procedures or practices that permit the government to make,
individualized assessments of the proposed uses for the property involved.
(b) Discrimination and exclusion
(1) Equal terms
No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that treats
a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious
assembly or institution.
(2) Nondiscrimination
No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation that discriminates
against any assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious denomination.
(3) Exclusions and limits
No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation that—
(A) totally excludes religious assemblies from a jurisdiction; or
(B) unreasonably limits religious assemblies, institutions, or structures within a
jurisdiction.

42 U.S. Code § 2000cc–1 - Protection of religious exercise of institutionalized
persons
(a) General rule
No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person
residing in or confined to an institution, as defined in section 1997 of this title, even if
the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government
demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person—
(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and
(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
(b) Scope of application
This section applies in any case in which—
(1) the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal
financial assistance; or
(2) the substantial burden affects, or removal of that substantial burden would affect,
commerce with foreign nations, among the several States, or with Indian tribes.

Relevant Additional provisions
42 U.S. Code § 2000cc–2 - Judicial relief
(a) Cause of action
A person may assert a violation of this chapter as a claim or defense in a judicial
proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government. Standing to assert a
claim or defense under this section shall be governed by the general rules of standing
under article III of the Constitution.
(b) Burden of persuasion
If a plaintiff produces prima facie evidence to support a claim alleging a violation of the
Free Exercise Clause or a violation of section 2000cc of this title, the government shall
bear the burden of persuasion on any element of the claim, except that the plaintiff
shall bear the burden of persuasion on whether the law (including a regulation) or
government practice that is challenged by the claim substantially burdens the plaintiff’s
exercise of religion.

***
42 U.S. Code § 2000cc–3 - Rules of construction

(a) Religious belief unaffected
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize any government to burden any
religious belief.

The First Amendment

Note:	  The	  Relevance	  of	  RLUIPA	  for	  RFRA	  
RLUIPA, 114 STAT. 806 (2000), also amended RFRA:
SEC. 7. AMENDMENTS TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT.
(a) DEFINITIONS.—Section 5 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42
U.S.C. 2000bb–2) is amended—
(1) in paragraph (1), by striking ‘‘a State, or a subdivision of a State’’ and inserting ‘‘or of
a covered entity’’;
(2) in paragraph (2), by striking ‘‘term’’ and all that follows through ‘‘includes’’ and
inserting ‘‘term ‘covered entity’ means’’; and
(3) in paragraph (4), by striking all after ‘‘means’’ and inserting ‘‘religious exercise, as
defined in section 8 of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of
2000.’’. (b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—Section 6(a) of the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb–3(a)) is amended by striking ‘‘and
State’’.

In the majority opinion in Hobby Lobby, Justice Alito discussed the
relevance of this amendment:
Following our decision in City of Boerne, Congress passed the Religious Land
Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 803, 42 U.S.C.
§2000cc et seq. That statute, enacted under Congress’s Commerce and
Spending Clause powers, imposes the same general test as RFRA but on a more
limited category of governmental actions. See Cutter v. Wilkinson (2005). And,
what is most relevant for present purposes, RLUIPA amended RFRA’s definition
of the “exercise of religion.” See §2000bb–2(4) (importing RLUIPA definition).
Before RLUIPA, RFRA’s definition made reference to the First Amendment. See
§2000bb–2(4) (1994 ed.) (defining “exercise of religion” as “the exercise of religion
under the First Amendment”). In RLUIPA, in an obvious effort to effect a
complete separation from First Amendment case law, Congress deleted the
reference to the First Amendment and defined the “exercise of religion” to
include “any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a
system of religious belief.” §2000cc–5(7)(A). And Congress mandated that this
concept “be construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the
maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution.”
§2000cc–3(g).

In the dissenting opinion in Hobby Lobby, Justice Ginsburg disagreed:
Despite these authoritative indications, the Court sees RFRA as a bold initiative
departing from, rather than restoring, pre-Smith jurisprudence. To support its
conception of RFRA as a measure detached from this Court’s decisions, one that
sets a new course, the Court points first to the Religious Land Use and
Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. §2000cc etseq. ***
which altered RFRA’s definition of the term “exercise of religion.” RFRA, as
originally enacted, defined that term to mean “the exercise of religion under the
First Amendment to the Constitution.”
As amended by RLUIPA, RFRA’s
definition now includes “any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or
central to, a system of religious belief.” That definitional change, according to
the Court, reflects “an obvious effort to effect a complete separation from First
Amendment case law.”

Robson

1153

The First Amendment

The Court’s reading is not plausible. RLUIPA’s alteration clarifies that courts
should not question the centrality of a particular religious exercise. But the
amendment in no way suggests that Congress meant to expand the class of
entities qualified to mount religious accommodation claims, nor does it relieve
courts of the obligation to inquire whether a government action substantially
burdens a religious exercise.

Who do you think has the better argument?

Note:	  Prison	  Litigation	  Under	  RLUIPA	  
Writing for a unanimous Court in Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709
(2005), Justice Ginsburg upheld the constitutionality of RLUIPA’s section
3, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc—1(a)(1)—(2), providing that “No government shall
impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person
residing in or confined to an institution,” unless the burden furthers “a
compelling governmental interest,” and does so by “the least restrictive
means.” The prison officials had argued that that this provision, on its
face, improperly advanced religion in violation of the First Amendment’s
Establishment Clause as impermissibly advancing religion by giving
greater protection to religious rights than to other constitutionally
protected rights. The Court noted that religious accommodation in prison
would be adjudicated with “particular sensitivity” to security concerns.
In another unanimous opinion, the Court in Holt (Muhammad) v. Hobbs,
574 US __ (2015), held that the Arkansas Department of Correction’s
grooming policy violated RLUIPA to the extent that it prohibited petitioner
from growing a ½ inch beard in accordance with his religious beliefs.
Writing for the Court, Justice Alito rejected the Department of
Correction's beard ban as the least restrictive way of furthering prison
safety and security including hiding contraband (an argument that was
"hard to take seriously" in the context of the ½ inch beard) and
concealing identities (an argument that suffered in comparison to other
institutions and the Arkansas DOC’s allowance of ¼ inch beards and
mustaches).
The Court’s rejection of the Arkansas DOC’s argument as not meriting
serious attention does raise the issue of the Eighth Circuit’s and district
judge’s crediting of that argument in their rulings against the pro se
prisoner.
Additionally, Justice Ginsburg concurred separately to state:
Unlike the exemption this Court approved in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.,
accommodating petitioner’s religious belief in this case would not detrimentally
affect others who do not share petitioner’s belief. On that understanding, I join
the Court’s opinion.

Our review confirms that the laws in question were enacted by officials who did
not understand, failed to perceive, or chose to ignore the fact that their official
actions violated the Nation's essential commitment to religious freedom. The
challenged laws had an impermissible object; and in all events the principle of
general applicability was violated because the secular ends asserted in defense
of the laws were pursued only with respect to conduct motivated by religious
beliefs. We invalidate the challenged enactments and reverse the judgment of
the Court of Appeals.
I
A
This case involves practices of the Santeria religion, which originated in the
19th century. When hundreds of thousands of members of the Yoruba people
were brought as slaves from western Africa to Cuba, their traditional African
religion absorbed significant elements of Roman Catholicism. The resulting
syncretion, or fusion, is Santeria, "the way of the saints." The Cuban Yoruba
express their devotion to spirits, called oris has, through the iconography of
Catholic saints, Catholic symbols are often present at Santeria rites, and
Santeria devotees attend the Catholic sacraments.
The Santeria faith teaches that every individual has a destiny from God, a
destiny fulfilled with the aid and energy of the oris has. The basis of the
Santeria religion is the nurture of a personal relation with the oris has, and one
of the principal forms of devotion is an animal sacrifice. The sacrifice of animals
as part of religious rituals has ancient roots. Animal sacrifice is mentioned
throughout the Old Testament, and it played an important role in the practice
of Judaism before destruction of the second Temple in Jerusalem. In modern
Islam, there is an annual sacrifice commemorating Abraham's sacrifice of a ram
in the stead of his son.

Robson

1155

The First Amendment

According to Santeria teaching, the orishas are powerful but not immortal. They
depend for survival on the sacrifice. Sacrifices are performed at birth, marriage,
and death rites, for the cure of the sick, for the initiation of new members and
priests, and during an annual celebration. Animals sacrificed in Santeria rituals
include chickens, pigeons, doves, ducks, guinea pigs, goats, sheep, and turtles.
The animals are killed by the cutting of the carotid arteries in the neck. The
sacrificed animal is cooked and eaten, except after healing and death rituals.
Santeria adherents faced widespread persecution in Cuba, so the religion and
its rituals were practiced in secret. The open practice of Santeria and its rites
remains infrequent. The religion was brought to this Nation most often by exiles
from the Cuban revolution. The District Court estimated that there are at least
50,000 practitioners in South Florida today.
B
Petitioner Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. (Church), is a not-for-profit
corporation organized under Florida law in 1973. The Church and its
congregants practice the Santeria religion. The president of the Church is
petitioner Ernesto Pichardo, who is also the Church's priest and holds the
religious title of Italero, the second highest in the Santeria faith. In April 1987,
the Church leased land in the city of Hialeah, Florida, and announced plans to
establish a house of worship as well as a school, cultural center, and museum.
Pichardo indicated that the Church's goal was to bring the practice of the
Santeria faith, including its ritual of animal sacrifice, into the open. The Church
began the process of obtaining utility service and receiving the necessary
licensing, inspection, and zoning approvals. Although the Church's efforts at
obtaining the necessary licenses and permits were far from smooth, it appears
that it received all needed approvals by early August 1987.
The prospect of a Santeria church in their midst was distressing to many
members of the Hialeah community, and the announcement of the plans to
open a Santeria church in Hialeah prompted the city council to hold an
emergency public session on June 9, 1987. ***
A summary suffices here, beginning with the enactments passed at the June 9
meeting. First, the city council adopted Resolution 87-66, which noted the
"concern" expressed by residents of the city "that certain religions may propose
to engage in practices which are inconsistent with public morals, peace or
safety," and declared that "[t]he City reiterates its commitment to a prohibition
against any and all acts of any and all religious groups which are inconsistent
with public morals, peace or safety." Next, the council approved an emergency
ordinance, Ordinance 87-40, which incorporated in full, except as to penalty,
Florida's animal cruelty laws. Fla. Stat. ch. 828 (1987). Among other things, the
incorporated state law subjected to criminal punishment "[w]hoever ...
unnecessarily or cruelly ... kills any animal." § 828.12
The city council desired to undertake further legislative action, but Florida law
prohibited a municipality from enacting legislation relating to animal cruelty
that conflicted with state law. To obtain clarification, Hialeah's city attorney
requested an opinion from the attorney general of Florida as to whether §
828.12 prohibited "a religious group from sacrificing an animal in a religious
ritual or practice" and whether the city could enact ordinances "making

Robson

1156

The First Amendment

religious animal sacrifice unlawful." The attorney general responded in mid-July.
He concluded that the "ritual sacrifice of animals for purposes other than food
consumption" was not a "necessary" killing and so was prohibited by § 828.12.
Fla. Op. Atty. Gen. 87-56 (1988). The attorney general appeared to define
"unnecessary" as "done without any useful motive, in a spirit of wanton cruelty
or for the mere pleasure of destruction without being in any sense beneficial or
useful to the person killing the animal." He advised that religious animal
sacrifice was against state law, so that a city ordinance prohibiting it would not
be in conflict.
The city council responded at first with a hortatory enactment, Resolution 8790, that noted its residents' "great concern regarding the possibility of public
ritualistic animal sacrifices" and the state-law prohibition. The resolution
declared the city policy "to oppose the ritual sacrifices of animals" within
Hialeah and announced that any person or organization practicing animal
sacrifice "will be prosecuted."
In September 1987, the city council adopted three substantive ordinances
addressing the issue of religious animal sacrifice. Ordinance 87-52 defined
"sacrifice" as "to unnecessarily kill, torment, torture, or mutilate an animal in a
public or private ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of food
consumption," and prohibited owning or possessing an animal "intending to use
such animal for food purposes." It restricted application of this prohibition,
however, to any individual or group that "kills, slaughters or sacrifices animals
for any type of ritual, regardless of whether or not the flesh or blood of the
animal is to be consumed." The ordinance contained an exemption for
slaughtering by "licensed establishment[s]" of animals "specifically raised for
food purposes." Declaring, moreover, that the city council "has determined that
the sacrificing of animals within the city limits is contrary to the public health,
safety, welfare and morals of the community," the city council adopted
Ordinance 87-71. That ordinance defined "sacrifice" as had Ordinance 87-52,
and then provided that "[i]t shall be unlawful for any person, persons,
corporations or associations to sacrifice any animal within the corporate limits
of the City of Hialeah, Florida." The final Ordinance, 87-72, defined "slaughter"
as "the killing of animals for food" and prohibited slaughter outside of areas
zoned for slaughterhouse use. The ordinance provided an exemption, however,
for the slaughter or processing for sale of "small numbers of hogs and/or cattle
per week in accordance with an exemption provided by state law." All
ordinances and resolutions passed the city council by unanimous vote.
Violations of each of the four ordinances were punishable by fines not exceeding
$500 or imprisonment not exceeding 60 days, or both.
Following enactment of these ordinances, the Church and Pichardo filed this
action pursuant to 42 U. S. C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Florida. Named as defendants were the city of Hialeah and
its mayor and members of its city council in their individual capacities. Alleging
violations of petitioners' rights under, inter alia, the Free Exercise Clause, the
complaint sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive and monetary relief.
The District Court granted summary judgment to the individual defendants,
finding that they had absolute immunity for their legislative acts and that the

Robson

1157

The First Amendment

ordinances and resolutions adopted by the council did not constitute an official
policy of harassment, as alleged by petitioners.
After a 9-day bench trial on the remaining claims, the District Court ruled for
the city, finding no violation of petitioners' rights under the Free Exercise
Clause. Although acknowledging that "the ordinances are not religiously
neutral," and that the city's concern about animal sacrifice was "prompted" by
the establishment of the Church in the city, the District Court concluded that
the purpose of the ordinances was not to exclude the Church from the city but
to end the practice of animal sacrifice, for whatever reason practiced. The court
also found that the ordinances did not target religious conduct "on their face,"
though it noted that in any event "specifically regulating [religious] conduct"
does not violate the First Amendment "when [the conduct] is deemed
inconsistent with public health and welfare." Thus, the court concluded that, at
most, the ordinances' effect on petitioners' religious conduct was "incidental to
[their] secular purpose and effect."
The District Court proceeded to determine whether the governmental interests
underlying the ordinances were compelling and, if so, to balance the
"governmental and religious interests." The court noted that "[t]his 'balance
depends upon the cost to the government of altering its activity to allow the
religious practice to continue unimpeded versus the cost to the religious
interest imposed by the government activity.'" The court found four compelling
interests. First, the court found that animal sacrifices present a substantial
health risk, both to participants and the general public. According to the court,
animals that are to be sacrificed are often kept in unsanitary conditions and are
uninspected, and animal remains are found in public places. Second, the court
found emotional injury to children who witness the sacrifice of animals. Third,
the court found compelling the city's interest in protecting animals from cruel
and unnecessary killing. The court determined that the method of killing used
in Santeria sacrifice was "unreliable and not humane, and that the animals,
before being sacrificed, are often kept in conditions that produce a great deal of
fear and stress in the animal." Fourth, the District Court found compelling the
city's interest in restricting the slaughter or sacrifice of animals to areas zoned
for slaughterhouse use. This legal determination was not accompanied by
factual findings.
Balancing the competing governmental and religious interests, the District
Court concluded the compelling governmental interests "fully justify the
absolute prohibition on ritual sacrifice" accomplished by the ordinances. The
court also concluded that an exception to the sacrifice prohibition for religious
conduct would "'unduly interfere with fulfillment of the governmental interest'"
because any more narrow restrictions-e. g., regulation of disposal of animal
carcasses-would be unenforceable as a result of the secret nature of the
Santeria religion. A religious exemption from the city's ordinances, concluded
the court, would defeat the city's compelling interests in enforcing the
prohibition.
The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in a one-paragraph per
curiam opinion. Choosing not to rely on the District Court's recitation of a
compelling interest in promoting the welfare of children, the Court of Appeals
stated simply that it concluded the ordinances were consistent with the

Robson

1158

The First Amendment

Constitution. It declined to address the effect of Employment Div., Dept. of
Human Resources of Ore.v. Smith (1990), decided after the District Court's
opinion, because the District Court "employed an arguably stricter standard"
than that applied in Smith.
II
The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which has been applied to
the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that "Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof .... " (Emphasis added.) The city does not argue that Santeria is
not a "religion" within the meaning of the First Amendment. Nor could it.
Although the practice of animal sacrifice may seem abhorrent to some,
"religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible
to others in order to merit First Amendment protection." Given the historical
association between animal sacrifice and religious worship, petitioners'
assertion that animal sacrifice is an integral part of their religion "cannot be
deemed bizarre or incredible." Neither the city nor the courts below, moreover,
have questioned the sincerity of petitioners' professed desire to conduct animal
sacrifices for religious reasons. We must consider petitioners' First Amendment
claim.
In addressing the constitutional protection for free exercise of religion, our
cases establish the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general
applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if
the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.
Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith. Neutrality and
general applicability are interrelated, and, as becomes apparent in this case,
failure to satisfy one requirement is a likely indication that the other has not
been satisfied. A law failing to satisfy these requirements must be justified by a
compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that
interest. These ordinances fail to satisfy the Smith requirements. We begin by
discussing neutrality.
A
In our Establishment Clause cases we have often stated the principle that the
First Amendment forbids an official purpose to disapprove of a particular
religion or of religion in general. These cases, however, for the most part have
addressed governmental efforts to benefit religion or particular religions, and so
have dealt with a question different, at least in its formulation and emphasis,
from the issue here. Petitioners allege an attempt to disfavor their religion
because of the religious ceremonies it commands, and the Free Exercise Clause
is dispositive in our analysis.
At a minimum, the protections of the Free Exercise Clause pertain if the law at
issue discriminates against some or all religious beliefs or regulates or prohibits
conduct because it is undertaken for religious reasons. These principles,
though not often at issue in our Free Exercise Clause cases, have played a role
in some. In McDaniel v. Paty (1978), for example, we invalidated a state law that
disqualified members of the clergy from holding certain public offices, because
it "impose[d] special disabilities on the basis of ... religious status." On the same
principle, in Fowler v. Rhode Island (1953) we found that a municipal ordinance

Robson

1159

The First Amendment

was applied in an unconstitutional manner when interpreted to prohibit
preaching in a public park by a Jehovah's Witness but to permit preaching
during the course of a Catholic mass or Protestant church service.
1
Although a law targeting religious beliefs as such is never permissible, if the
object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious
motivation, the law is not neutral, and it is invalid unless it is justified by a
compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to advance that interest. There are,
of course, many ways of demonstrating that the object or purpose of a law is
the suppression of religion or religious conduct. To determine the object of a law,
we must begin with its text, for the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a
law not discriminate on its face. A law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a
religious practice without a secular meaning discernible from the language or
context. Petitioners contend that three of the ordinances fail this test of facial
neutrality because they use the words "sacrifice" and "ritual," words with strong
religious connotations. We agree that these words are consistent with the claim
of facial discrimination, but the argument is not conclusive. The words
"sacrifice" and "ritual" have a religious origin, but current use admits also of
secular meanings. The ordinances, furthermore, define "sacrifice" in secular
terms, without referring to religious practices.
We reject the contention advanced by the city that our inquiry must end with
the text of the laws at issue. Facial neutrality is not determinative. The Free
Exercise Clause, like the Establishment Clause, extends beyond facial
discrimination. The Clause "forbids subtle departures from neutrality," and
"covert suppression of particular religious beliefs." Official action that targets
religious conduct for distinctive treatment cannot be shielded by mere
compliance with the requirement of facial neutrality. The Free Exercise Clause
protects against governmental hostility which is masked as well as overt. "The
Court must survey meticulously the circumstances of governmental categories
to eliminate, as it were, religious gerrymanders." Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New
York City (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring).
The record in this case compels the conclusion that suppression of the central
element of the Santeria worship service was the object of the ordinances. First,
though use of the words "sacrifice" and "ritual" does not compel a finding of
improper targeting of the Santeria religion, the choice of these words is support
for our conclusion. There are further respects in which the text of the city
council's enactments discloses the improper attempt to target Santeria.
Resolution 87-66, adopted June 9, 1987, recited that "residents and citizens of
the City of Hialeah have expressed their concern that certain religions may
propose to engage in practices which are inconsistent with public morals, peace
or safety," and "reiterate[d]" the city's commitment to prohibit "any and all
[such] acts of any and all religious groups." No one suggests, and on this record
it cannot be maintained, that city officials had in mind a religion other than
Santeria.
It becomes evident that these ordinances target Santeria sacrifice when the
ordinances' operation is considered. Apart from the text, the effect of a law in its
real operation is strong evidence of its object. To be sure, adverse impact will

Robson

1160

The First Amendment

not always lead to a finding of impermissible targeting. For example, a social
harm may have been a legitimate concern of government for reasons quite apart
from discrimination. McGowan v. Maryland. See, e. g., Reynolds v. United States
(1879); Davis v. Beason (1890). The subject at hand does implicate, of course,
multiple concerns unrelated to religious animosity, for example, the suffering or
mistreatment visited upon the sacrificed animals and health hazards from
improper disposal. But the ordinances when considered together disclose an
object remote from these legitimate concerns. The design of these laws
accomplishes instead a "religious gerrymander," Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New
York City (Harlan, J., concurring), an impermissible attempt to target petitioners
and their religious practices.
It is a necessary conclusion that almost the only conduct subject to Ordinances
87-40, 87-52, and 87-71 is the religious exercise of Santeria church members.
The texts show that they were drafted in tandem to achieve this result. We
begin with Ordinance 87-71. It prohibits the sacrifice of animals, but defines
sacrifice as "to unnecessarily kill ... an animal in a public or private ritual or
ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption." The definition
excludes almost all killings of animals except for religious sacrifice, and the
primary purpose requirement narrows the proscribed category even further, in
particular by exempting kosher slaughter. We need not discuss whether this
differential treatment of two religions is itself an independent constitutional
violation. It suffices to recite this feature of the law as support for our
conclusion that Santeria alone was the exclusive legislative concern. The net
result of the gerrymander is that few if any killings of animals are prohibited
other than Santeria sacrifice, which is proscribed because it occurs during a
ritual or ceremony and its primary purpose is to make an offering to the oris
has, not food consumption. Indeed, careful drafting ensured that, although
Santeria sacrifice is prohibited, killings that are no more necessary or humane
in almost all other circumstances are unpunished.
Operating in similar fashion is Ordinance 87-52, which prohibits the
"possess[ion], sacrifice, or slaughter" of an animal with the "inten[t] to use such
animal for food purposes." This prohibition, extending to the keeping of an
animal as well as the killing itself, applies if the animal is killed in "any type of
ritual" and there is an intent to use the animal for food, whether or not it is in
fact consumed for food. The ordinance exempts, however, "any licensed [food]
establishment" with regard to "any animals which are specifically raised for food
purposes," if the activity is permitted by zoning and other laws. This exception,
too, seems intended to cover kosher slaughter. Again, the burden of the
ordinance, in practical terms, falls on Santeria adherents but almost no others:
If the killing is-unlike most Santeria sacrifices-unaccompanied by the intent to
use the animal for food, then it is not prohibited by Ordinance 87-52; if the
killing is specifically for food but does not occur during the course of "any type
of ritual," it again falls outside the prohibition; and if the killing is for food and
occurs during the course of a ritual, it is still exempted if it occurs in a properly
zoned and licensed establishment and involves animals "specifically raised for
food purposes." A pattern of exemptions parallels the pattern of narrow
prohibitions. Each contributes to the gerrymander.

Robson

1161

The First Amendment

Ordinance 87-40 incorporates the Florida animal cruelty statute, Fla. Stat. §
828.12 (1987). Its prohibition is broad on its face, punishing "[w]hoever ...
unnecessarily ... kills any animal." The city claims that this ordinance is the
epitome of a neutral prohibition. The problem, however, is the interpretation
given to the ordinance by respondent and the Florida attorney general. Killings
for religious reasons are deemed unnecessary, whereas most other killings fall
outside the prohibition. The city, on what seems to be a per se basis, deems
hunting, slaughter of animals for food, eradication of insects and pests, and
euthanasia as necessary. There is no indication in the record that respondent
has concluded that hunting or fishing for sport is unnecessary. Indeed, one of
the few reported Florida cases decided under § 828.12 concludes that the use of
live rabbits to train greyhounds is not unnecessary. Further, because it
requires an evaluation of the particular justification for the killing, this
ordinance represents a system of "individualized governmental assessment of
the reasons for the relevant conduct," Employment Div., Dept. of Human
Resources of Ore. v. Smith. As we noted in Smith, in circumstances in which
individualized exemptions from a general requirement are available, the
government "may not refuse to extend that system to cases of 'religious
hardship' without compelling reason." Respondent's application of the
ordinance's test of necessity devalues religious reasons for killing by judging
them to be of lesser import than nonreligious reasons. Thus, religious practice
is being singled out for discriminatory treatment.
We also find significant evidence of the ordinances' improper targeting of
Santeria sacrifice in the fact that they proscribe more religious conduct than is
necessary to achieve their stated ends. It is not unreasonable to infer, at least
when there are no persuasive indications to the contrary, that a law which
visits "gratuitous restrictions" on religious conduct, McGowan v. Maryland
(opinion of Frankfurter, J.), seeks not to effectuate the stated governmental
interests, but to suppress the conduct because of its religious motivation.
The legitimate governmental interests in protecting the public health and
preventing cruelty to animals could be addressed by restrictions stopping far
short of a fiat prohibition of all Santeria sacrificial practice. If improper disposal,
not the sacrifice itself, is the harm to be prevented, the city could have imposed
a general regulation on the disposal of organic garbage. It did not do so. Indeed,
counsel for the city conceded at oral argument that, under the ordinances,
Santeria sacrifices would be illegal even if they occurred in licensed, inspected,
and zoned slaughterhouses. Thus, these broad ordinances prohibit Santeria
sacrifice even when it does not threaten the city's
Under similar analysis, narrower regulation would achieve the city's interest in
preventing cruelty to animals. With regard to the city's interest in ensuring the
adequate care of animals, regulation of conditions and treatment, regardless of
why an animal is kept, is the logical response to the city's concern, not a
prohibition on possession for the purpose of sacrifice. The same is true for the
city's interest in prohibiting cruel methods of killing. Under federal and Florida
law and Ordinance 87-40, which incorporates Florida law in this regard, killing
an animal by the "simultaneous and instantaneous severance of the carotid
arteries with a sharp instrument"-the method used in kosher slaughter-is
approved as humane. The District Court found that, though Santeria sacrifice

Robson

1162

The First Amendment

also results in severance of the carotid arteries, the method used during
sacrifice is less reliable and therefore not humane. If the city has a real concern
that other methods are less humane, however, the subject of the regulation
should be the method of slaughter itself, not a religious classification that is
said to bear some general relation to it.
Ordinance 87-72-unlike the three other ordinances does appear to apply to
substantial nonreligious conduct and not to be overbroad. For our purposes
here, however, the four substantive ordinances may be treated as a group for
neutrality purposes. Ordinance 87-72 was passed the same day as Ordinance
87-71 and was enacted, as were the three others, in direct response to the
opening of the Church. It would be implausible to suggest that the three other
ordinances, but not Ordinance 87-72, had as their object the suppression of
religion. We need not decide whether Ordinance 87-72 could survive
constitutional scrutiny if it existed separately; it must be invalidated because it
functions, with the rest of the enactments in question, to suppress Santeria
religious worship.
2
[plurality]
In determining if the object of a law is a neutral one under the Free Exercise
Clause, we can also find guidance in our equal protection cases. As Justice
Harlan noted in the related context of the Establishment Clause, "[n]eutrality in
its application requires an equal protection mode of analysis." Walz v. Tax
Comm'n of New York City (concurring opinion). Here, as in equal protection
cases, we may determine the city council's object from both direct and
circumstantial evidence. Relevant evidence includes, among other things, the
historical background of the decision under challenge, the specific series of
events leading to the enactment or official policy in question, and the legislative
or administrative history, including contemporaneous statements made by
members of the decisionmaking body. These objective factors bear on the
question of discriminatory object. Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney
(1979).
That the ordinances were enacted "'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,'" their
suppression of Santeria religious practice is revealed by the events preceding
their enactment. Although respondent claimed at oral argument that it had
experienced significant problems resulting from the sacrifice of animals within
the city before the announced opening of the Church, the city council made no
attempt to address the supposed problem before its meeting in June 1987, just
weeks after the Church announced plans to open. The minutes and taped
excerpts of the June 9 session, both of which are in the record, evidence
significant hostility exhibited by residents, members of the city council, and
other city officials toward the Santeria religion and its practice of animal
sacrifice. The public crowd that attended the June 9 meetings interrupted
statements by council members critical of Santeria with cheers and the brief
comments of Pichardo with taunts. When Councilman Martinez, a supporter of
the ordinances, stated that in prerevolution Cuba "people were put in jail for
practicing this religion," the audience applauded.
Other statements by members of the city council were in a similar vein. For
example, Councilman Martinez, after noting his belief that Santeria was

Robson

1163

The First Amendment

outlawed in Cuba, questioned: "[I]f we could not practice this [religion] in our
homeland [Cuba], why bring it to this country?" Councilman Cardoso said that
Santeria devotees at the Church "are in violation of everything this country
stands for." Councilman Mejides indicated that he was "totally against the
sacrificing of animals" and distinguished kosher slaughter because it had a
"real purpose." The "Bible says we are allowed to sacrifice an animal for
consumption," he continued, "but for any other purposes, I don't believe that
the Bible allows that." The president of the city council, Councilman Echevarria,
asked: "What can we do to prevent the Church from opening?"
Various Hialeah city officials made comparable comments.
The chaplain of the Hialeah Police Department told the city council that
Santeria was a sin, "foolishness," "an abomination to the Lord," and the worship
of "demons." He advised the city council: "We need to be helping people and
sharing with them the truth that is found in Jesus Christ." He concluded: "I
would exhort you ... not to permit this Church to exist." The city attorney
commented that Resolution 87-66 indicated: "This community will not tolerate
religious practices which are abhorrent to its citizens .... " Similar comments
were made by the deputy city attorney. This history discloses the object of the
ordinances to target animal sacrifice by Santeria worshippers because of its
religious motivation.
3
In sum, the neutrality inquiry leads to one conclusion: The ordinances had as
their object the suppression of religion. The pattern we have recited discloses
animosity to Santeria adherents and their religious practices; the ordinances by
their own terms target this religious exercise; the texts of the ordinances were
gerrymandered with care to proscribe religious killings of animals but to
exclude almost all secular killings; and the ordinances suppress much more
religious conduct than is necessary in order to achieve the legitimate ends
asserted in their defense. These ordinances are not neutral, and the court below
committed clear error in failing to reach this conclusion.
B
We turn next to a second requirement of the Free Exercise Clause, the rule that
laws burdening religious practice must be of general applicability. Employment
Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith. All laws are selective to some
extent, but categories of selection are of paramount concern when a law has the
incidental effect of burdening religious practice. The Free Exercise Clause
"protect[s] religious observers against unequal treatment," Hobbie v.
Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Fla. (1987) (Stevens, J., concurring in
judgment), and inequality results when a legislature decides that the
governmental interests it seeks to advance are worthy of being pursued only
against conduct with a religious motivation.
The principle that government, in pursuit of legitimate interests, cannot in a
selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief
is essential to the protection of the rights guaranteed by the Free Exercise
Clause. The principle underlying the general applicability requirement has
parallels in our First Amendment jurisprudence. In this case we need not define
with precision the standard used to evaluate whether a prohibition is of general

Robson

1164

The First Amendment

application, for these ordinances fall well below the minimum standard
necessary to protect First Amendment rights.
Respondent claims that Ordinances 87-40, 87-52, and 87-71 advance two
interests: protecting the public health and preventing cruelty to animals. The
ordinances are underinclusive for those ends. They fail to prohibit nonreligious
conduct that endangers these interests in a similar or greater degree than
Santeria sacrifice does. The underinclusion is substantial, not inconsequential.
Despite the city's proffered interest in preventing cruelty to animals, the
ordinances are drafted with care to forbid few killings but those occasioned by
religious sacrifice. Many types of animal deaths or kills for nonreligious reasons
are either not prohibited or approved by express provision. For example, fishing
- which occurs in Hialeah, -is legal. Extermination of mice and rats within a
home is also permitted. Florida law incorporated by Ordinance 87-40 sanctions
euthanasia of "stray, neglected, abandoned, or unwanted animals;" destruction
of animals judicially removed from their owners "for humanitarian reasons" or
when the animal "is of no commercial value;" the infliction of pain or suffering
"in the interest of medical science;" the placing of poison in one's yard or
enclosure; and the use of a live animal "to pursue or take wildlife or to
participate in any hunting," and "to hunt wild hogs."
The city concedes that "neither the State of Florida nor the City has enacted a
generally applicable ban on the killing of animals." It asserts, however, that
animal sacrifice is "different" from the animal killings that are permitted by law.
According to the city, it is "self-evident" that killing animals for food is
"important"; the eradication of insects and pests is "obviously justified"; and the
euthanasia of excess animals "makes sense." These ipse dixits do not explain
why religion alone must bear the burden of the ordinances, when many of these
secular killings fall within the city's interest in preventing the cruel treatment of
animals.
The ordinances are also underinclusive with regard to the city's interest in
public health, which is threatened by the disposal of animal carcasses in open
public places and the consumption of uninspected meat. Neither interest is
pursued by respondent with regard to conduct that is not motivated by religious
conviction. The health risks posed by the improper disposal of animal carcasses
are the same whether Santeria sacrifice or some nonreligious killing preceded it.
The city does not, however, prohibit hunters from bringing their kill to their
houses, nor does it regulate disposal after their activity. Despite substantial
testimony at trial that the same public health hazards result from improper
disposal of garbage by restaurants, restaurants are outside the scope of the
ordinances. Improper disposal is a general problem that causes substantial
health risks, but which respondent addresses only when it results from
religious exercise.
The ordinances are underinclusive as well with regard to the health risk posed
by consumption of uninspected meat. Under the city's ordinances, hunters may
eat their kill and fishermen may eat their catch without undergoing
governmental inspection. Likewise, state law requires inspection of meat that is
sold but exempts meat from animals raised for the use of the owner and
"members of his household and nonpaying guests and employees." The asserted

Robson

1165

The First Amendment

interest in inspected meat is not pursued in contexts similar to that of religious
animal sacrifice.
Ordinance 87-72, which prohibits the slaughter of animals outside of areas
zoned for slaughterhouses, is underinclusive on its face. The ordinance
includes an exemption for "any person, group, or organization" that "slaughters
or processes for sale, small numbers of hogs and/or cattle per week in
accordance with an exemption provided by state law." Respondent has not
explained why commercial operations that slaughter "small numbers" of hogs
and cattle do not implicate its professed desire to prevent cruelty to animals
and preserve the public health. Although the city has classified Santeria
sacrifice as slaughter, subjecting it to this ordinance, it does not regulate other
killings for food in like manner.
We conclude, in sum, that each of Hialeah's ordinances pursues the city's
governmental interests only against conduct motivated by religious belief. The
ordinances "ha[ve] every appearance of a prohibition that society is prepared to
impose upon [Santeria worshippers] but not upon itself." This precise evil is
what the requirement of general applicability is designed to prevent.
III
A law burdening religious practice that is not neutral or not of general
application must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny. To satisfy the
commands of the First Amendment, a law restrictive of religious practice must
advance" 'interests of the highest order'" and must be narrowly tailored in
pursuit of those interests. The compelling interest standard that we apply once
a law fails to meet the Smith requirements is not "water[ed] ... down" but "really
means what it says." A law that targets religious conduct for distinctive
treatment or advances legitimate governmental interests only against conduct
with a religious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare cases. It
follows from what we have already said that these ordinances cannot withstand
this scrutiny.
First, even were the governmental interests compelling, the ordinances are not
drawn in narrow terms to accomplish those interests. As we have discussed, all
four ordinances are overbroad or underinclusive in substantial respects. The
proffered objectives are not pursued with respect to analogous nonreligious
conduct, and those interests could be achieved by narrower ordinances that
burdened religion to a far lesser degree. The absence of narrow tailoring suffices
to establish the invalidity of the ordinances.
Respondent has not demonstrated, moreover, that, in the context of these
ordinances, its governmental interests are compelling. Where government
restricts only conduct protected by the First Amendment and fails to enact
feasible measures to restrict other conduct producing substantial harm or
alleged harm of the same sort, the interest given in justification of the
restriction is not compelling. It is established in our strict scrutiny
jurisprudence that "a law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest 'of the
highest order' ... when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital
interest unprohibited." As we show above, the ordinances are underinclusive to
a substantial extent with respect to each of the interests that respondent has
asserted, and it is only conduct motivated by religious conviction that bears the

Robson

1166

The First Amendment

weight of the governmental restrictions. There can be no serious claim that
those interests justify the ordinances.
IV
The Free Exercise Clause commits government itself to religious tolerance, and
upon even slight suspicion that proposals for state intervention stem from
animosity to religion or distrust of its practices, all officials must pause to
remember their own high duty to the Constitution and to the rights it secures.
Those in office must be resolute in resisting importunate demands and must
ensure that the sole reasons for imposing the burdens of law and regulation are
secular. Legislators may not devise mechanisms, overt or disguised, designed to
persecute or oppress a religion or its practices. The laws here in question were
enacted contrary to these constitutional principles, and they are void.
Reversed.
JUSTICE SCALIA, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE JOINS, CONCURRING IN PART AND
CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
The Court analyzes the "neutrality" and the "general applicability" of the
Hialeah ordinances in separate sections (Parts II-A and II-B, respectively), and
allocates various invalidating factors to one or the other of those sections. If it
were necessary to make a clear distinction between the two terms, I would draw
a line somewhat different from the Court's. But I think it is not necessary, and
would frankly acknowledge that the terms are not only "interrelated," but
substantially overlap.
The terms "neutrality" and "general applicability" are not to be found within the
First Amendment itself, of course, but are used in Employment Div., Dept. of
Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith (1990), and earlier cases to describe those
characteristics which cause a law that prohibits an activity a particular
individual wishes to engage in for religious reasons nonetheless not to
constitute a "law ... prohibiting the free exercise" of religion within the meaning
of the First Amendment. In my view, the defect of lack of neutrality applies
primarily to those laws that by their terms impose disabilities on the basis of
religion (e. g., a law excluding members of a certain sect from public benefits;
whereas the defect of lack of general applicability applies primarily to those
laws which, though neutral in their terms, through their design, construction,
or enforcement target the practices of a particular religion for discriminatory
treatment. But certainly a law that is not of general applicability (in the sense I
have described) can be considered "nonneutral"; and certainly no law that is
nonneutral (in the relevant sense) can be thought to be of general applicability.
Because I agree with most of the invalidating factors set forth in Part II of the
Court's opinion, and because it seems to me a matter of no consequence under
which rubric ("neutrality," Part II-A, or "general applicability," Part II-B) each
invalidating factor is discussed, I join the judgment of the Court and all of its
opinion except section 2 of Part II-A.
I do not join that section because it departs from the opinion's general focus on
the object of the laws at issue to consider the subjective motivation of the
lawmakers, i. e., whether the Hialeah City Council actually intended to disfavor

Robson

1167

The First Amendment

the religion of Santeria. As I have noted elsewhere, it is virtually impossible to
determine the singular "motive" of a collective legislative body, and this Court
has a long tradition of refraining from such inquiries, see, e. g., Fletcher v. Peck
(1810) (Marshall, C. J.); United States v. O'Brien (1968).
Perhaps there are contexts in which determination of legislative motive must be
undertaken. But I do not think that is true of analysis under the First
Amendment. *** Had the ordinances here been passed with no motive on the
part of any councilman except the ardent desire to prevent cruelty to animals
(as might in fact have been the case), they would nonetheless be invalid.
JUSTICE SOUTER, CONCURRING IN PART AND CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT.
This case turns on a principle about which there is no disagreement, that the
Free Exercise Clause bars government action aimed at suppressing religious
belief or practice. The Court holds that Hialeah's animal-sacrifice laws violate
that principle, and I concur in that holding without reservation.
Because prohibiting religious exercise is the object of the laws at hand, this
case does not present the more difficult issue addressed in our last free-exercise
case, Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith (1990), which
announced the rule that a "neutral, generally applicable" law does not run afoul
of the Free Exercise Clause even when it prohibits religious exercise in effect.
The Court today refers to that rule in dicta, and despite my general agreement
with the Court's opinion I do not join Part II, where the dicta appear, for I have
doubts about whether the Smith rule merits adherence. I write separately to
explain why the Smith rule is not germane to this case and to express my view
that, in a case presenting the issue, the Court should reexamine the rule Smith
declared. ***
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, WITH WHOM JUSTICE O'CONNOR JOINS, CONCURRING IN THE
JUDGMENT.
The Court holds today that the city of Hialeah violated the First and Fourteenth
Amendments when it passed a set of restrictive ordinances explicitly directed at
petitioners' religious practice. With this holding I agree. I write separately to
emphasize that the First Amendment's protection of religion extends beyond
those rare occasions on which the government explicitly targets religion (or a
particular religion) for disfavored treatment, as is done in this case. In my view,
a statute that burdens the free exercise of religion "may stand only if the law in
general, and the State's refusal to allow a religious exemption in particular, are
justified by a compelling interest that cannot be served by less restrictive
means." Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith (1990)
(dissenting opinion). The Court, however, applies a different test. It applies the
test announced in Smith, under which "a law that is neutral and of general
applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if
the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice." I
continue to believe that Smith was wrongly decided, because it ignored the
value of religious freedom as an affirmative individual liberty and treated the
Free Exercise Clause as no more than an antidiscrimination principle. Thus,

Equal	  Employment	  Opportunity	  Commission	  
565 U.S. ___ (2012)

ROBERTS, C. J., DELIVERED THE OPINION FOR A UNANIMOUS COURT. THOMAS, J., FILED A
CONCURRING OPINION. ALITO, J., FILED A CONCURRING OPINION, IN WHICH KAGAN, J., JOINED.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.
Certain employment discrimination laws authorize employees who have been
wrongfully terminated to sue their employers for reinstatement and damages.
The question presented is whether the Establishment and Free Exercise
Clauses of the First Amendment bar such an action when the employer is a
religious group and the employee is one of the group's ministers.
I
A
Petitioner Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School is a
member congregation of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, the second
largest Lutheran denomination in America. Hosanna-Tabor operated a small
school in Redford, Michigan, offering a "Christ-centered education" to students
in kindergarten through eighth grade.
The Synod classifies teachers into two categories: "called" and "lay." "Called"
teachers are regarded as having been called to their vocation by God through a
congregation. To be eligible to receive a call from a congregation, a teacher must
satisfy certain academic requirements. One way of doing so is by completing a
"colloquy" program at a Lutheran college or university. The program requires
candidates to take eight courses of theological study, obtain the endorsement of
their local Synod district, and pass an oral examination by a faculty committee.
A teacher who meets these requirements may be called by a congregation. Once
called, a teacher receives the formal title "Minister of Religion, Commissioned."
A commissioned minister serves for an open-ended term; at Hosanna-Tabor, a
call could be rescinded only for cause and by a supermajority vote of the
congregation.
"Lay" or "contract" teachers, by contrast, are not required to be trained by the
Synod or even to be Lutheran. At Hosanna-Tabor, they were appointed by the
school board, without a vote of the congregation, to one-year renewable terms.
Although teachers at the school generally performed the same duties regardless
of whether they were lay or called, lay teachers were hired only when called
teachers were unavailable.
Respondent Cheryl Perich was first employed by Hosanna-Tabor as a lay
teacher in 1999. After Perich completed her colloquy later that school year,
Hosanna-Tabor asked her to become a called teacher. Perich accepted the call
and received a "diploma of vocation" designating her a commissioned minister.

Robson

1169

The First Amendment

Perich taught kindergarten during her first four years at Hosanna-Tabor and
fourth grade during the 2003-2004 school year. She taught math, language arts,
social studies, science, gym, art, and music. She also taught a religion class
four days a week, led the students in prayer and devotional exercises each day,
and attended a weekly school-wide chapel service. Perich led the chapel service
herself about twice a year.
Perich became ill in June 2004 with what was eventually diagnosed as
narcolepsy. Symptoms included sudden and deep sleeps from which she could
not be roused. Because of her illness, Perich began the 2004-2005 school year
on disability leave. On January 27, 2005, however, Perich notified the school
principal, Stacey Hoeft, that she would be able to report to work the following
month. Hoeft responded that the school had already contracted with a lay
teacher to fill Perich's position for the remainder of the school year. Hoeft also
expressed concern that Perich was not yet ready to return to the classroom.
On January 30, Hosanna-Tabor held a meeting of its congregation at which
school administrators stated that Perich was unlikely to be physically capable
of returning to work that school year or the next. The congregation voted to
offer Perich a "peaceful release" from her call, whereby the congregation would
pay a portion of her health insurance premiums in exchange for her resignation
as a called teacher. Perich refused to resign and produced a note from her
doctor stating that she would be able to return to work on February 22. The
school board urged Perich to reconsider, informing her that the school no longer
had a position for her, but Perich stood by her decision not to resign.
On the morning of February 22--the first day she was medically cleared to
return to work--Perich presented herself at the school. Hoeft asked her to leave
but she would not do so until she obtained written documentation that she had
reported to work. Later that afternoon, Hoeft called Perich at home and told her
that she would likely be fired. Perich responded that she had spoken with an
attorney and intended to assert her legal rights.
Following a school board meeting that evening, board chairman Scott Salo sent
Perich a letter stating that Hosanna-Tabor was reviewing the process for
rescinding her call in light of her "regrettable" actions. Salo subsequently
followed up with a letter advising Perich that the congregation would consider
whether to rescind her call at its next meeting. As grounds for termination, the
letter cited Perich's "insubordination and disruptive behavior" on February 22,
as well as the damage she had done to her "working relationship" with the
school by "threatening to take legal action." The congregation voted to rescind
Perich's call on April 10, and Hosanna-Tabor sent her a letter of termination the
next day.
B
Perich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
alleging that her employment had been terminated in violation of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (1990). The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating
against a qualified individual on the basis of disability. It also prohibits an
employer from retaliating "against any individual because such individual has
opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such

Robson

1170

The First Amendment

individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in
an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [the ADA]."
The EEOC brought suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleging that Perich had been
fired in retaliation for threatening to file an ADA lawsuit. Perich intervened in
the litigation, claiming unlawful retaliation under both the ADA and the
Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act. The EEOC and Perich
sought Perich's reinstatement to her former position (or frontpay in lieu thereof),
along with backpay, compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and
other injunctive relief.
Hosanna-Tabor moved for summary judgment. Invoking what is known as the
"ministerial exception," the Church argued that the suit was barred by the First
Amendment because the claims at issue concerned the employment
relationship between a religious institution and one of its ministers. According
to the Church, Perich was a minister, and she had been fired for a religious
reason--namely, that her threat to sue the Church violated the Synod's belief
that Christians should resolve their disputes internally.
The District Court agreed that the suit was barred by the ministerial exception
and granted summary judgment in Hosanna-Tabor's favor. ***
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated and remanded, directing the
District Court to proceed to the merits of Perich's retaliation claims. The Court
of Appeals recognized the existence of a ministerial exception barring certain
employment discrimination claims against religious institutions--an exception
"rooted in the First Amendment's guarantees of religious freedom.” The court
concluded, however, that Perich did not qualify as a "minister" under the
exception, noting in particular that her duties as a called teacher were identical
to her duties as a lay teacher. Judge White concurred. She viewed the question
whether Perich qualified as a minister to be closer than did the majority, but
agreed that the "fact that the duties of the contract teachers are the same as
the duties of the called teachers is telling."
We granted certiorari.
II
The First Amendment provides, in part, that "Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."
We have said that these two Clauses "often exert conflicting pressures," Cutter v.
Wilkinson (2005), and that there can be "internal tension ... between the
Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause," Tilton v. Richardson (1971)
(plurality opinion). Not so here. Both Religion Clauses bar the government from
interfering with the decision of a religious group to fire one of its ministers.
A
Controversy between church and state over religious offices is hardly new. In
1215, the issue was addressed in the very first clause of Magna Carta. There,
King John agreed that "the English church shall be free, and shall have its
rights undiminished and its liberties unimpaired." The King in particular
accepted the "freedom of elections," a right "thought to be of the greatest
necessity and importance to the English church."

Robson

1171

The First Amendment

That freedom in many cases may have been more theoretical than real. See, e.g.,
W. Warren, Henry II 312 (1973) (recounting the writ sent by Henry II to the
electors of a bishopric in Winchester, stating: "I order you to hold a free election,
but forbid you to elect anyone but Richard my clerk"). In any event, it did not
survive the reign of Henry VIII, even in theory. The Act of Supremacy of 1534,
26 Hen.8, ch.1, made the English monarch the supreme head of the Church,
and the Act in Restraint of Annates, 25 Hen. 8, ch.20, passed that same year,
gave him the authority to appoint the Church's high officials. See G. Elton, The
Tudor Constitution: Documents and Commentary 331-332 (1960). Various Acts
of Uniformity, enacted subsequently, tightened further the government's grip on
the exercise of religion. The Uniformity Act of 1662, for instance, limited service
as a minister to those who formally assented to prescribed tenets and pledged
to follow the mode of worship set forth in the Book of Common Prayer. Any
minister who refused to make that pledge was "deprived of all his Spiritual
Promotions."
Seeking to escape the control of the national church, the Puritans fled to New
England, where they hoped to elect their own ministers and establish their own
modes of worship. William Penn, the Quaker proprietor of what would
eventually become Pennsylvania and Delaware, also sought independence from
the Church of England. The charter creating the province of Pennsylvania
contained no clause establishing a religion.
Colonists in the South, in contrast, brought the Church of England with them.
But even they sometimes chafed at the control exercised by the Crown and its
representatives over religious offices. In Virginia, for example, the law vested the
governor with the power to induct ministers presented to him by parish vestries,
2 Hening's Statutes at Large 46 (1642), but the vestries often refused to make
such presentations and instead chose ministers on their own. Controversies
over the selection of ministers also arose in other Colonies with Anglican
establishments, including North Carolina. There, the royal governor insisted
that the right of presentation lay with the Bishop of London, but the colonial
assembly enacted laws placing that right in the vestries. Authorities in England
intervened, repealing those laws as inconsistent with the rights of the Crown.
It was against this background that the First Amendment was adopted.
Familiar with life under the established Church of England, the founding
generation sought to foreclose the possibility of a national church. See 1 Annals
of Cong. 730-731 (1789) (noting that the Establishment Clause addressed the
fear that "one sect might obtain a pre-eminence, or two combine together, and
establish a religion to which they would compel others to conform" (remarks of
J. Madison)). By forbidding the "establishment of religion" and guaranteeing the
"free exercise thereof," the Religion Clauses ensured that the new Federal
Government--unlike the English Crown--would have no role in filling
ecclesiastical offices. The Establishment Clause prevents the Government from
appointing ministers, and the Free Exercise Clause prevents it from interfering
with the freedom of religious groups to select their own.
This understanding of the Religion Clauses was reflected in two events involving
James Madison, "'the leading architect of the religion clauses of the First
Amendment.'" Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn (2011). The
first occurred in 1806, when John Carroll, the first Catholic bishop in the

Robson

1172

The First Amendment

United States, solicited the Executive's opinion on who should be appointed to
direct the affairs of the Catholic Church in the territory newly acquired by the
Louisiana Purchase. After consulting with President Jefferson, then-Secretary of
State Madison responded that the selection of church "functionaries" was an
"entirely ecclesiastical" matter left to the Church's own judgment. Letter from
James Madison to Bishop Carroll (Nov. 20, 1806). The "scrupulous policy of the
Constitution in guarding against a political interference with religious affairs,"
Madison explained, prevented the Government from rendering an opinion on
the "selection of ecclesiastical individuals."
The second episode occurred in 1811, when Madison was President. Congress
had passed a bill incorporating the Protestant Episcopal Church in the town of
Alexandria in what was then the District of Columbia. Madison vetoed the bill,
on the ground that it "exceeds the rightful authority to which Governments are
limited, by the essential distinction between civil and religious functions, and
violates, in particular, the article of the Constitution of the United States, which
declares, that 'Congress shall make no law respecting a religious
establishment.'" Madison explained:
"The bill enacts into, and establishes by law, sundry rules and proceedings
relative purely to the organization and polity of the church incorporated, and
comprehending even the election and removal of the Minister of the same; so that
no change could be made therein by the particular society, or by the general
church of which it is a member, and whose authority it recognises." (emphasis
added).
B
Given this understanding of the Religion Clauses--and the absence of
government employment regulation generally--it was some time before
questions about government interference with a church's ability to select its
own ministers came before the courts. This Court touched upon the issue
indirectly, however, in the context of disputes over church property. Our
decisions in that area confirm that it is impermissible for the government to
contradict a church's determination of who can act as its ministers.
In Watson v. Jones (1872), the Court considered a dispute between antislavery
and proslavery factions over who controlled the property of the Walnut Street
Presbyterian Church in Louisville, Kentucky. The General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church had recognized the antislavery faction, and this Court-applying not the Constitution but a "broad and sound view of the relations of
church and state under our system of laws"--declined to question that
determination. We explained that "whenever the questions of discipline, or of
faith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law have been decided by the highest of
[the] church judicatories to which the matter has been carried, the legal
tribunals must accept such decisions as final, and as binding on them." As we
would put it later, our opinion in Watson "radiates ... a spirit of freedom for
religious organizations, an independence from secular control or manipulation-in short, power to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of
church government as well as those of faith and doctrine." Kedroff v. Saint
Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in North America (1952).

Robson

1173

The First Amendment

Confronting the issue under the Constitution for the first time in Kedroff, the
Court recognized that the "[f]reedom to select the clergy, where no improper
methods of choice are proven," is "part of the free exercise of religion" protected
by the First Amendment against government interference. At issue in Kedroff
was the right to use a Russian Orthodox cathedral in New York City. *** We
explained that the controversy over the right to use the cathedral was "strictly a
matter of ecclesiastical government, the power of the Supreme Church
Authority of the Russian Orthodox Church to appoint the ruling hierarch of the
archdiocese of North America." ***
This Court reaffirmed these First Amendment principles in Serbian Eastern
Orthodox Diocese for United States and Canada v. Milivojevich (1976), a case
involving a dispute over control of the American-Canadian Diocese of the
Serbian Orthodox Church, including its property and assets. The Church had
removed Dionisije Milivojevich as bishop of the American-Canadian Diocese
because of his defiance of the church hierarchy. Following his removal,
Dionisije brought a civil action in state court challenging the Church's decision,
and the Illinois Supreme Court "purported in effect to reinstate Dionisije as
Diocesan Bishop," on the ground that the proceedings resulting in his removal
failed to comply with church laws and regulations.
Reversing that judgment, this Court explained that the First Amendment
"permit[s] hierarchical religious organizations to establish their own rules and
regulations for internal discipline and government, and to create tribunals for
adjudicating disputes over these matters." When ecclesiastical tribunals decide
such disputes, we further explained, "the Constitution requires that civil courts
accept their decisions as binding upon them." We thus held that by inquiring
into whether the Church had followed its own procedures, the State Supreme
Court had "unconstitutionally undertaken the resolution of quintessentially
religious controversies whose resolution the First Amendment commits
exclusively to the highest ecclesiastical tribunals" of the Church.
C
Until today, we have not had occasion to consider whether this freedom of a
religious organization to select its ministers is implicated by a suit alleging
discrimination in employment. The Courts of Appeals, in contrast, have had
extensive experience with this issue. Since the passage of Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, and other employment discrimination laws, the Courts of
Appeals have uniformly recognized the existence of a "ministerial exception,"
grounded in the First Amendment, that precludes application of such legislation
to claims concerning the employment relationship between a religious
institution and its ministers.
We agree that there is such a ministerial exception. The members of a religious
group put their faith in the hands of their ministers. Requiring a church to
accept or retain an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to do
so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision. Such action
interferes with the internal governance of the church, depriving the church of
control over the selection of those who will personify its beliefs. By imposing an
unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free Exercise Clause, which protects
a religious group's right to shape its own faith and mission through its
appointments. According the state the power to determine which individuals

Robson

1174

The First Amendment

will minister to the faithful also violates the Establishment Clause, which
prohibits government involvement in such ecclesiastical decisions.
The EEOC and Perich acknowledge that employment discrimination laws would
be unconstitutional as applied to religious groups in certain circumstances.
They grant, for example, that it would violate the First Amendment for courts to
apply such laws to compel the ordination of women by the Catholic Church or
by an Orthodox Jewish seminary. According to the EEOC and Perich, religious
organizations could successfully defend against employment discrimination
claims in those circumstances by invoking the constitutional right to freedom of
association--a right "implicit" in the First Amendment. The EEOC and Perich
thus see no need--and no basis--for a special rule for ministers grounded in the
Religion Clauses themselves.
We find this position untenable. The right to freedom of association is a right
enjoyed by religious and secular groups alike. It follows under the EEOC's and
Perich's view that the First Amendment analysis should be the same, whether
the association in question is the Lutheran Church, a labor union, or a social
club. That result is hard to square with the text of the First Amendment itself,
which gives special solicitude to the rights of religious organizations. We cannot
accept the remarkable view that the Religion Clauses have nothing to say about
a religious organization's freedom to select its own ministers.
The EEOC and Perich also contend that our decision in Employment Div., Dept.
of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith (1990), precludes recognition of a
ministerial exception. In Smith, ***
It is true that the ADA's prohibition on retaliation, like Oregon's prohibition on
peyote use, is a valid and neutral law of general applicability. But a church's
selection of its ministers is unlike an individual's ingestion of peyote. Smith
involved government regulation of only outward physical acts. The present case,
in contrast, concerns government interference with an internal church decision
that affects the faith and mission of the church itself. The contention that Smith
forecloses recognition of a ministerial exception rooted in the Religion Clauses
has no merit.
III
Having concluded that there is a ministerial exception grounded in the Religion
Clauses of the First Amendment, we consider whether the exception applies in
this case. We hold that it does.
Every Court of Appeals to have considered the question has concluded that the
ministerial exception is not limited to the head of a religious congregation, and
we agree. We are reluctant, however, to adopt a rigid formula for deciding when
an employee qualifies as a minister. It is enough for us to conclude, in this our
first case involving the ministerial exception, that the exception covers Perich,
given all the circumstances of her employment.
To begin with, Hosanna-Tabor held Perich out as a minister, with a role distinct
from that of most of its members. When Hosanna-Tabor extended her a call, it
issued her a "diploma of vocation" according her the title "Minister of Religion,
Commissioned." She was tasked with performing that office "according to the
Word of God and the confessional standards of the Evangelical Lutheran

Robson

1175

The First Amendment

Church as drawn from the Sacred Scriptures." The congregation prayed that
God "bless [her] ministrations to the glory of His holy name, [and] the building
of His church." In a supplement to the diploma, the congregation undertook to
periodically review Perich's "skills of ministry" and "ministerial responsibilities,"
and to provide for her "continuing education as a professional person in the
ministry of the Gospel."
Perich's title as a minister reflected a significant degree of religious training
followed by a formal process of commissioning. To be eligible to become a
commissioned minister, Perich had to complete eight college-level courses in
subjects including biblical interpretation, church doctrine, and the ministry of
the Lutheran teacher. She also had to obtain the endorsement of her local
Synod district by submitting a petition that contained her academic transcripts,
letters of recommendation, personal statement, and written answers to various
ministry-related questions. Finally, she had to pass an oral examination by a
faculty committee at a Lutheran college. It took Perich six years to fulfill these
requirements. And when she eventually did, she was commissioned as a
minister only upon election by the congregation, which recognized God's call to
her to teach. At that point, her call could be rescinded only upon a
supermajority vote of the congregation--a protection designed to allow her to
"preach the Word of God boldly."
Perich held herself out as a minister of the Church by accepting the formal call
to religious service, according to its terms. She did so in other ways as well. For
example, she claimed a special housing allowance on her taxes that was
available only to employees earning their compensation "'in the exercise of the
ministry.'" In a form she submitted to the Synod following her termination,
Perich again indicated that she regarded herself as a minister at HosannaTabor, stating: "I feel that God is leading me to serve in the teaching ministry ....
I am anxious to be in the teaching ministry again soon."
Perich's job duties reflected a role in conveying the Church's message and
carrying out its mission. Hosanna-Tabor expressly charged her with "lead[ing]
others toward Christian maturity" and "teach[ing] faithfully the Word of God,
the Sacred Scriptures, in its truth and purity and as set forth in all the
symbolical books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church." In fulfilling these
responsibilities, Perich taught her students religion four days a week, and led
them in prayer three times a day. Once a week, she took her students to a
school-wide chapel service, and--about twice a year--she took her turn leading
it, choosing the liturgy, selecting the hymns, and delivering a short message
based on verses from the Bible. During her last year of teaching, Perich also led
her fourth graders in a brief devotional exercise each morning. As a source of
religious instruction, Perich performed an important role in transmitting the
Lutheran faith to the next generation.
In light of these considerations--the formal title given Perich by the Church, the
substance reflected in that title, her own use of that title, and the important
religious functions she performed for the Church--we conclude that Perich was
a minister covered by the ministerial exception.
*** Although the Sixth Circuit did not adopt the extreme position pressed here
by the EEOC, it did regard the relative amount of time Perich spent performing

Robson

1176

The First Amendment

religious functions as largely determinative. The issue before us, however, is not
one that can be resolved by a stopwatch. The amount of time an employee
spends on particular activities is relevant in assessing that employee's status,
but that factor cannot be considered in isolation, without regard to the nature
of the religious functions performed and the other considerations discussed
above.
Because Perich was a minister within the meaning of the exception, the First
Amendment requires dismissal of this employment discrimination suit against
her religious employer. The EEOC and Perich originally sought an order
reinstating Perich to her former position as a called teacher. By requiring the
Church to accept a minister it did not want, such an order would have plainly
violated the Church's freedom under the Religion Clauses to select its own
ministers.
Perich no longer seeks reinstatement, having abandoned that relief before this
Court. But that is immaterial. Perich continues to seek frontpay in lieu of
reinstatement, backpay, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's
fees. An award of such relief would operate as a penalty on the Church for
terminating an unwanted minister, and would be no less prohibited by the First
Amendment than an order overturning the termination. Such relief would
depend on a determination that Hosanna-Tabor was wrong to have relieved
Perich of her position, and it is precisely such a ruling that is barred by the
ministerial exception.
The EEOC and Perich suggest that Hosanna-Tabor's asserted religious reason
for firing Perich--that she violated the Synod's commitment to internal dispute
resolution--was pretextual. That suggestion misses the point of the ministerial
exception. The purpose of the exception is not to safeguard a church's decision
to fire a minister only when it is made for a religious reason. The exception
instead ensures that the authority to select and control who will minister to the
faithful - a matter "strictly ecclesiastical," - is the church's alone.
IV
The EEOC and Perich foresee a parade of horribles that will follow our
recognition of a ministerial exception to employment discrimination suits.
According to the EEOC and Perich, such an exception could protect religious
organizations from liability for retaliating against employees for reporting
criminal misconduct or for testifying before a grand jury or in a criminal trial.
What is more, the EEOC contends, the logic of the exception would confer on
religious employers "unfettered discretion" to violate employment laws by, for
example, hiring children or aliens not authorized to work in the United States.
Hosanna-Tabor responds that the ministerial exception would not in any way
bar criminal prosecutions for interfering with law enforcement investigations or
other proceedings. Nor, according to the Church, would the exception bar
government enforcement of general laws restricting eligibility for employment,
because the exception applies only to suits by or on behalf of ministers
themselves. Hosanna-Tabor also notes that the ministerial exception has been
around in the lower courts for 40 years and has not given rise to the dire
consequences predicted by the EEOC and Perich.

Robson

1177

The First Amendment

The case before us is an employment discrimination suit brought on behalf of a
minister, challenging her church's decision to fire her. Today we hold only that
the ministerial exception bars such a suit. We express no view on whether the
exception bars other types of suits, including actions by employees alleging
breach of contract or tortious conduct by their religious employers. There will
be time enough to address the applicability of the exception to other
circumstances if and when they arise.
The interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination
statutes is undoubtedly important. But so too is the interest of religious groups
in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out their
mission. When a minister who has been fired sues her church alleging that her
termination was discriminatory, the First Amendment has struck the balance
for us. The church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its way.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE THOMAS, CONCURRING.
I join the Court's opinion. I write separately to note that, in my view, the
Religion Clauses require civil courts to apply the ministerial exception and to
defer to a religious organization's good-faith understanding of who qualifies as
its minister. ***
JUSTICE ALITO, WITH WHOM JUSTICE KAGAN JOINS, CONCURRING.
I join the Court's opinion, but I write separately to clarify my understanding of
the significance of formal ordination and designation as a "minister" in
determining whether an "employee" of a religious group falls within the so-called
"ministerial" exception. The term "minister" is commonly used by many
Protestant denominations to refer to members of their clergy, but the term is
rarely if ever used in this way by Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, or
Buddhists. In addition, the concept of ordination as understood by most
Christian churches and by Judaism has no clear counterpart in some Christian
denominations and some other religions. Because virtually every religion in the
world is represented in the population of the United States, it would be a
mistake if the term "minister" or the concept of ordination were viewed as
central to the important issue of religious autonomy that is presented in cases
like this one. Instead, courts should focus on the function performed by
persons who work for religious bodies. ***
The "ministerial" exception should *** apply to any "employee" who leads a
religious organization, conducts worship services or important religious
ceremonies or rituals, or serves as a messenger or teacher of its faith. If a
religious group believes that the ability of such an employee to perform these
key functions has been compromised, then the constitutional guarantee of
religious freedom protects the group's right to remove the employee from his or
her position.
***
Robson

1178

The First Amendment

II
B
*** The ministerial exception applies to respondent because, as the Court notes,
she played a substantial role in "conveying the Church's message and carrying
out its mission." She taught religion to her students four days a week and took
them to chapel on the fifth day. She led them in daily devotional exercises, and
led them in prayer three times a day. She also alternated with the other
teachers in planning and leading worship services at the school chapel,
choosing liturgies, hymns, and readings, and composing and delivering a
message based on Scripture.
It makes no difference that respondent also taught secular subjects. While a
purely secular teacher would not qualify for the "ministerial" exception, the
constitutional protection of religious teachers is not somehow diminished when
they take on secular functions in addition to their religious ones. What matters
is that respondent played an important role as an instrument of her church's
religious message and as a leader of its worship activities. Because of these
important religious functions, Hosanna-Tabor had the right to decide for itself
whether respondent was religiously qualified to remain in her office.
Hosanna-Tabor discharged respondent because she threatened to file suit
against the church in a civil court. This threat contravened the Lutheran
doctrine that disputes among Christians should be resolved internally without
resort to the civil court system and all the legal wrangling it entails. In
Hosanna-Tabor's view, respondent's disregard for this doctrine compromised
her religious function, disqualifying her from serving effectively as a voice for
the church's faith. Respondent does not dispute that the Lutheran Church
subscribes to a doctrine of internal dispute resolution, but she argues that this
was a mere pretext for her firing, which was really done for nonreligious
reasons.
For civil courts to engage in the pretext inquiry that respondent and the
Solicitor General urge us to sanction would dangerously undermine the
religious autonomy that lower court case law has now protected for nearly four
decades. In order to probe the real reason for respondent's firing, a civil court-and perhaps a jury--would be required to make a judgment about church
doctrine. The credibility of Hosanna-Tabor's asserted reason for terminating
respondent's employment could not be assessed without taking into account
both the importance that the Lutheran Church attaches to the doctrine of
internal dispute resolution and the degree to which that tenet compromised
respondent's religious function. If it could be shown that this belief is an
obscure and minor part of Lutheran doctrine, it would be much more plausible
for respondent to argue that this doctrine was not the real reason for her firing.
If, on the other hand, the doctrine is a central and universally known tenet of
Lutheranism, then the church's asserted reason for her discharge would seem
much more likely to be nonpretextual. But whatever the truth of the matter
might be, the mere adjudication of such questions would pose grave problems
for religious autonomy: It would require calling witnesses to testify about the
importance and priority of the religious doctrine in question, with a civil
factfinder sitting in ultimate judgment of what the accused church really
believes, and how important that belief is to the church's overall mission.

The First Amendment

At oral argument, both respondent and the United States acknowledged that a
pretext inquiry would sometimes be prohibited by principles of religious
autonomy, and both conceded that a Roman Catholic priest who is dismissed
for getting married could not sue the church and claim that his dismissal was
actually based on a ground forbidden by the federal antidiscrimination laws.
But there is no principled basis for proscribing a pretext inquiry in such a case
while permitting it in a case like the one now before us. The Roman Catholic
Church's insistence on clerical celibacy may be much better known than the
Lutheran Church's doctrine of internal dispute resolution, but popular
familiarity with a religious doctrine cannot be the determinative factor.
What matters in the present case is that Hosanna-Tabor believes that the
religious function that respondent performed made it essential that she abide
by the doctrine of internal dispute resolution; and the civil courts are in no
position to second-guess that assessment. This conclusion rests not on
respondent's ordination status or her formal title, but rather on her functional
status as the type of employee that a church must be free to appoint or dismiss
in order to exercise the religious liberty that the First Amendment guarantees.

Notes	  
1.
How far does Hosanna-Tabor extend? Consider whether a religious
school that employs secular teachers may terminate a teacher if she is
unmarried and becomes pregnant. What about a yoga studio?
2.
Would a statute seeking to extend employment protections to
persons working for “religious institutions” be consistent with Church of
the Lukumi Babalu Aye?
3.
Reconsider the relationship between the Establishment Clause and
the Free Exercise Clause. Given current doctrine, how would you
respond Justice Jackson in Everson that religious schools - - - and
presumably other entities and individuals - - - want it “both ways”?

Note:	  The	  “Play	  in	  the	  Joints”	  
In Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712 (2004), the Court upheld the constitutionality
of the Washington State “Promise Scholarship” that excluded “devotional
theology” from eligibility. Writing for the majority, CJ Rehnquist wrote that the
Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause are frequently “in tension” but
that there is “play in the joints” between the two clauses. The Court held that
the exemption was not hostility (or a targeting) of religion under Church of
Lukimi, but was consistent with the state’s anti-Establishment Clause concerns.
Importantly, Washington had a so-called Blaine Amendment in its state
constitution which prohibits government financial support of religion. Also

importantly, the Promise Scholarship did include religion and religious studies,
as well as students at religious schools.
The United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari for the 2016-2017
Term to Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Mo. v. Pauley regarding a Free
Exercise and Equal Protection challenge to a denial of state funding that was
based on a state constitutional provision prohibiting state funds be given to
religious organizations.
