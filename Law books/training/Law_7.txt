Ellen Klem is the Director of Consumer Education and Outreach for the Oregon Department of
Justice. Her mission is simple - prevent financial harm to Oregonians, especially older adults,
Oregonians whose first language is not English, and students who have incurred significant
education related debt. Before joining the Oregon Department of Justice, Ellen worked at the
American Bar Association Commission on Law and Aging in Washington, D.C., where she was
responsible for research, policy development, advocacy, education, and training. Ellen received
her bachelor’s degree from James Madison College at Michigan State University and a J.D. from
Case Western Reserve University School of Law.
I am a skilled attorney with 11 years of experience in corporate and elder law.
I spent the first 6 years of my career working to strengthen the legal rights of older Americans in
Washington, DC. I authored more than 70 publications, including 50 publications for a division
of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and gave nearly a dozen presentations all
across the country to lawyers, judges, academics, legislators, and advocates. I also served as the
principal investigator and co-author of “The American Bar Association Legal Guide for
Americans Over 50” published by Random House and the “Legal Guide for the Seriously Ill”
published by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.
In 2011, I was recruited by a growing software company to become the company’s first in-house
attorney. I independently negotiated a wide variety of contracts, including mutual non-disclosure
agreements, referral and partnership agreements, leasing and rental agreements, independent
contractor agreements, consulting agreements, and more than two-hundred and seventy-five
software-as-a-service agreements. I also: (a) created and implemented policies, including a
competitive intelligence policy, a collections policy, and a technology use policy, and (b)
successfully settled two copyright infringement claims made by a large stock photo agency.
In 2012, I worked as a contractor for a software company and an attorney engaged in private
practice.
I am currently working for the Oregon Department of Justice in the Office of the Attorney
General.
I am also volunteering my time to help establish a 501(c)(3) dedicated to monitoring the
guardianship and conservatorship services provided to incapacitated persons in Multnomah
County. The charitable organization is based - in part - on the guide I co-authored in 2011 titled,
“Volunteer Guardianship Monitoring and Assistance: Serving the Court and the Community”.

• Vocational Rehabilitation Counseling is a
young profession brought about by Workers
Compensation Legislation, the Counseling
Profession in general (which grew out of
vocational guidance), and rehabilitation
legislation in 1914‐20 relating to veterans and
industrial workers

RISE OF THE FORENSIC VOCATIONAL
EXPERT
• Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1954‐
“professionalized “ practice, established funds
for graduate training counselor education
programs
• Kerner v. Fleming (1960) led SSA to develop
“criteria for vocational experts to be employed to
offer direct testimony on the existence of
appropriate jobs in the labor market”
• 1960s saw dramatic increase in use of vocational
experts

REVIEW OF TYPICAL VOCATIONAL
EXPERT QUALIFICATIONS
Development/Funding of Masters Programs in
Rehabilitation Counseling by US Government led
to such being seen as a typical qualification.
• Vocational Experts are not limited to only one
discipline but those with backgrounds in
rehabilitation counseling and vocational
rehabilitation outnumber those in other
disciplines ( source: American Board of
Vocational Experts)

•

DOES YOUR VOCATIONAL EXPERT
HAVE TYPICAL TRAINING?
• The US Government contracts with over 1000
Vocational Experts (VE)
• Survey of selected characteristics of VEs
performed in 2009 is largest study with >500
respondents. (source International
Association of Rehabilitation Professionals
2009)

VE Education
• IARP Survey showed 94.6% of VEs possess a
Masters or Doctorate. 5.4% possess Bachelor’s
Degree.
Major field of study for degrees were:
• Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling
61.4%
• Counseling and Psychology 29.2%
• Other 3.4 %

VE Experience
• Mean Age of VE: 56.3 years
• Mean years of professional/clinical vocational
experience : 32.8 years
• Age range 25‐87
• Practice years range <1‐40

Alphabet Soup
• While any individual can provide expert
testimony if seen as an expert by trier of fact
most VEs have National
Credentials/Certifications
• Certified Rehabilitation Counselor (CRC) 81.5%
is the predominant certification in profession.
Such is a “Board Certification”
• 93% have two or more board certifications or
licenses

Alphabet Soup (cont.)
• Prior published IARP survey indicates other
common national board certifications include:
• Certified Disability Management Specialist
(CDMS)
• American Board of Vocational Experts
(ABVE/D or F (Diplomate or Fellow)
• Certified Case Manager (CCM)
• Certified Vocational Evaluator (CVE) in decline

Licenses
• No state license specific to Vocational Expert (but
most possess above certifications)
• Some are Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC)
• Some possess certification as a vocational
counselor with state Worker’s Comp Division
which requires less training than national
credentials
• Some outliers possess no certification or license
and are particularly vulnerable in cross.

Importance of Standard Training and
Credentials
• If almost 95% of VEs have Masters or above and your
expert lacks such will their testimony be given the
same weight?
• If 97% of have degrees in rehabilitation counseling,
counseling or closely related fields will your expert’s
degree in another field be seen as odd/substandard?
• If 81.5% of VEs out there are CRCs and there are
thousands of them why is an attorney not using one.
• If 93% of VEs have two or more National board
certifications why does yours have none?

Potential motivations for some
attorneys to utilize experts without
standard training/certification
• Standard Method: Experts without such have no
ethical standard of practice or scope of practice
to adhere to. If standard method is ignored
outcomes and opinions have no foundation.
Some shop outliers for desired outcomes
• Ignorance of the standards: Many attorneys
naturally assume all VEs have the same education
and licenses since such is the norm for other
professions

Is Standard Method Being Used?
• Does your or opposing expert have sufficient
vocationally relevant information?
• Has an interview taken place?
• Has the expert been given a copy of deposition or
other description of work history, education, etc.
if interview has not taken place?
• If there is limited work history or individual has
been out of the labor market many years has
vocational testing been considered?

Is Standard Method Being Used?
(cont.)
• Has a Transferable Skills Analysis been
performed?
• Has expert only used published
wage/employment data or also used employer
sampling (where more specific information is
required (problems with data aggregation)
• Has typical educational background for an
occupation been considered
• Has outlook in occupation been addressed?

Is Standard Method Being Used?
(cont.)
• Special issues: Over 1/3 of family law cases have
contention of physical or mental barrier to
employment. Such is routinely very poorly
addressed by family lawyers compared to those
in PI and WC
• A diagnosis does not equal a work limitation
• Has a physical capacities form been completed by
MD?
• Has a psychological limitation form been
completed by psychologist or counselor? Who is

A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Whether we act in the role of advocate and representative or as dispute resolution
professional, our legal training can often blind us to the forces which bind and repel our clients.
From our first exposure to legal causation and the vexations of proximate cause and Palsgraf,
we naturally view causation as unidirectional. Further, we consistently dive into a pool of
conflicting allegations to pick out that shiny penny of fact lying on the bottom which will
establish our case. Our attention is turned to the content of our clients’ disputes. This focus on
content distracts us from the process occurring before our eyes. There is so much information
which is held in this process – such abundant opportunity for solution, that it is, indeed, a shame
that we miss this illuminating perspective. Be our role that of an advocate or mediator, a systems
perspective will provide an invaluable tool to help us help our clients.
When we sit in a room with disputing parties (individuals or organizations) they are not
alone. Outside the walls of our conference room or office are the large number of webs and
connections in which they are embedded. Each individual is a part of an often dizzying number
of systems (and subsystems) and these relationships tug on our disputants with unseen, but
tenacious, threads. Another set of connections – not immediately apparent to us – binds the
parties before us to each other.
Developing the facility to think in terms of the systems in which our parties are
embedded will make the invisible visible to us. Forces that keep people locked into their roles
with one another, despite the frustration and pain this may produce, will become clearer to us.
We will be able to work with these unseen hands, rather than have them block our best efforts.

THE SYSTEM
What is a “system?” Ludwig Von Bertalanffy is generally credited with developing
General Systems Theory. His definition is deceptively simple yet goes to the core concept. A
system is a set of elements standing in interaction. Put another way, a system is something that
is put together in such a way that whatever affects one part of it affects other parts. A metaphor
that is oft-used, and quite helpful, is that of a spider web. Touch one part and the rest shimmers
and vibrates. It is impossible to touch only one part of a spider web and not affect the other

2

sections. A change in the behavior of one part of a human interactive system will invariably
affect the behavior of other individuals within that system.
The human body is a very elegant system. If I wasn’t a committed Darwinian and saw
this intricate system as a jewel of evolution, I’d have to think of intelligent design because
nothing but the highest intelligence of natural selection or God could have created such a thing.
Our bodies are quintessential systems. Nothing operates independently from any other part. We
may be digesting our food happily until a threat arises – then our blood rushes immediately from
our torso to our limbs leaving our sandwich ignored. The complex internal chemistry of
hormone stimulation is a product of countless (literally) interactions, on both a cellular and gross
level.
Everything in a system stands in relationship to every other part – and these parts create a
separate organism. This organism may be a human body, or a marital (or divorcing) couple, a
nuclear family, an extended family, a business, a social or service club, a union, a law firm –
obviously the list goes on and on. The critical point, here, is that each system has similar
attributes. Each has constituent parts which assume various functions or roles within the whole.
Each has its own set of rules which binds these parts together. Each has a trajectory over time.
Each has a common set of strategies for maintaining its integrity – forestalling dissolution or
change which cannot be managed.
Thus, every client who sits before us not only is part of a system which includes the other
disputant, but also others outside the room. Our role in any particular subsystem brings its
accompanying rules and self-concept. A husband is also a father, a son, a brother, an employee,
a boss, a fraternity brother, etc. Sometimes these roles and expectations can be in conflict. Thus,
for example, a newly married husband may struggle with his role as a spouse and the conflicting
expectations set by his mother in his role as a son. We will turn our attention, here, to the rules
of systems as they impact spouses and their movement through the dissolution of their marriage.
RULES OF SYSTEMS
Homeostasis. This is, perhaps, the most important rule affecting the operation of a
system. This rule posits that every system has a steady state to which it will seek to return. The
most commonly employed metaphor is that of a thermostat. While a system can, indeed, change,
the force directing such change needs to overcome the incessant pull of homeostasis. A therapist
tells the following illustrative story: “I was working with a couple once in which the wife was
3

quite obese. She felt terrible about this and her husband complained perpetually about her
weight. There was so much, he’d spit out, that he couldn’t do because she was so heavy and had
no energy. She finally resolved to change her eating and exercise habits and finally, she was
able to lose a great deal of weight. When she reached her goal, her husband wanted to give her a
gift to let her know he appreciated her efforts. What did he give her? A big box of chocolates,
because (he said) he knew how much she enjoyed these.”
There are scores of dynamics which, once in place, become exceedingly difficult to
dislodge. The cycle of volatile conflict between spouses is often experienced as the only way
they can feel connected. When the heat begins to ease, one or both will feel the anxiety of a shift
that somehow means to them that they are becoming detached. Thus one or both will move to
reignite the conflict in order to return to the old, and more comfortable, level of interaction. The
“underfuntioning” spouse, who gives the corresponding overfunctioner a role of superior
caretaker, will face surprising resistance if he or she tries to modify their behavior and increase
their competence. The child who still lives at home in his twenties fill parents with dread at
prospect of turning him out to fend for himself. Often this has been attempted with failures or
terrible judgment drawing him back to the fold. His failures at launching another example of
homeostasis. Needless to say, the decision to end a marriage is a dramatic rupture of a
homeostatic process and will likely result in an explosive response. The insight this process
brings is that we should never be surprised (or overly judgmental) at the very natural process of
those seeking to return a particular system (of which they are an integral part) to its prior level
and pattern of functioning.
The Individual Symptom Carrier for the Whole. When the organization or family
is experiencing systemic stress, oftentimes an individual element of will take on this stress. In
family therapy this is known as the “identified patient.” (Note that my background is in family
systems, so this is the perspective I bring to this discussion. In light of this experience and
training, conceptualizing these principles within the context of the family is much easier for me.
Those who have been training in organizational systems thinking will naturally turn to the
business or other such system for examples of these principles. I have, however, attempted to
make some reference to non-family system applications when I am able.) The identified patient
is often a child who the parents bring in to therapy because he/she is acting out in some
disturbing way. Almost without exception, there are painful dynamics occurring within the
4

family and the child becomes the “symptom bearer” for the whole. It is generally accepted (and
actualized in practice) that if the stresses on the family system are addressed and alleviated, the
symptoms of the I.P. will abate. For example, if there are unaddressed and unresolved marital
stress, a child may take on this pain by failing school, engaging in drug or alcohol use,
inappropriate and/or dangerous sexual behavior, oppositional attitudes, depression, etc. It is
often in the interests of the parents to focus the attention on the problems with the kid because
this will allow them and their own painful interaction to avoid scrutiny. In the context of high
conflict divorce, the child may demonstrate a more intense level of symptomatology. Family
therapist offices are overflowing with families who initially arrive with complaints and concerns
about a child, only to have the therapist decide to treat the entire family system. Almost
invariably, there is pain and conflict between the parents and when that begins to ease, the
child’s problematic behavior (like magic!) will abate.
The tendency of any system under stress to isolate one of its members (or a subsystem )
should be borne in mind when a conflict involves the isolated member. Law firms are an
excellent example of this principle, since, in truth, lawyers tend to eschew attention to messy
interpersonal dynamics. Law firms undergo a variety of stressors – some of the most impactful
being the merger with another firm or the shedding of an important lawyer or department which
sets up shop on its own. There may also be a change in the compensation package or a
precipitous drop (or rise) in business. Whatever the trigger, the impact will reverberate
throughout the organization like the concentric rings emanating from the stone dropped into the
water (or the tendrils of the spider web). The anxiety (think of anxiety as discordant,
uncomfortable energy which infects the system) will spread to each member. The organism as a
whole will often respond to this stress by unconsciously selecting a member and scapegoating
that member. This is the way a system often copes with the stress of change. This member is
often selected wisely, as he/she (or they) maintain personal characteristics which allow them to
be identified as a problem. What is striking upon close observation is the energy with which the
scapegoated member will embrace their role – ramping up their behavior to fit the role of the
problem in the system. This is precisely where attention to “process” vs. “content” of a dispute
is so vital a perspective.

5

Since the reasons the system isolates and judges the problem member are usually quite
defensible, it is seductive to become minutely focused on the content of the problem – working
with the disputants to fashion a compromise or behavioral prescriptions for each side to lessen
the intensity of the dispute. None of this may matter, ultimately, if the real dynamic resides
elsewhere – in the evolution or challenges faced by the greater system. Therefore, it may be
useful when facilitating the resolution of a dispute to assess what kind of system these disputants
are embedded within and then explore what stressors are impacting the system. Oftentimes,
helping disputants think in these terms may assist each to disengage from their focus on the
content of their dispute. Another problem with over-emphasis on content is the need for each
person to assess blame. Usually, no effort could be less helpful, because causation in disputes is
commonly circular.
A Word About “Anxiety”: We hear this word “anxiety” a lot. To understand how it
operates within a relationship system, let’s not think of it as some hand-wringing weakness.
Rather, let’s understand anxiety as a universal form of basic, visceral discomfort or un-ease
which exists in us, all the way down to the cellular level.
Anxiety is a natural reaction to a potential threat. Whenever we experience some discomfort
or conflict with someone close to us, we will always experience anxiety. We may well not have
conventional “anxiety” symptoms like sweating, shaking, dry mouth and difficulty thinking
clearly (then again, we may), but we will not be at ease and completely comfortable in our own
skin. Here’s the thing about anxiety, it will almost always be accompanied by automatic
reactivity to our partner.
Because anxiety is uncomfortable and our intimate partner can trigger it so easily, we are
always vulnerable to reacting emotionally. That’s not “acting” emotionally, it is “reacting”
emotionally. The more intense our anxiety, the less we are able to think through our actions and
the more liable we are to automatic reactions. Murray Bowen, one of the true giants of family
therapy said,
As anxiety increases, people experience a greater need for emotional contact and
closeness and, in reaction to similar pressure from others, a greater need for
distance and emotional insulation. The more people respond based on anxiety, the
less tolerant they are of one another and the more they are irritated by
differences. They are less able to permit each other to be what they are. Anxiety
6

often increases feelings of being overloaded, overwhelmed, and isolated, feelings
that are accompanied by the wish for someone to lean on, to be taken care of, to
have responsibility lifted.

Circular Causation: Certainly in the context of interpersonal disputes within families (or
between intimate partners) the notion of circular causality is essential. This is different for those
of us who have been raised in a western culture in which Aristotelian notions of cause and effect
are basic in our thinking. This is particularly true among those of us who have been trained in
the law. Some very fine minds – no less than Dean William Prosser – have dissected the notion
of legal causation. To be sure, legal liability can only be grounded upon a finding that A caused
B. Was A the legal cause of B? (But for A, would B have occurred?) Was A the proximate
cause of B? (Were there intervening events which attenuate the connection between A and B to a
breaking point?) In the world of interpersonal disputes, however, it is circular causality which
best reflects the reality of the conflict. Each person believes that the problem started with the
other and they are just, rightfully, reacting to what the other did or said. Consider the oft-used
example of the couple in which the wife complains to the husband, “I feel so alone. You are
never around. You are always out with your friends leaving me sitting here at home to do all the
work. All you do is think of yourself” – to which he responds, “Of course I’m not around. All
you do is nag. If you eased up sometime I’d spend more time at home, but as it is now all I get is
your complaining and nagging.” She, of course replies, “If you were home more often, I
wouldn’t nag.” His retort, “If you nagged less, I’d be home more.”
People who are locked in the roles assigned them by the exigencies of the system which
is going through its own stress, will often create their own, idiosyncratic, rounds of circular
conflict. The underperforming employee who feels unmotivated because of the harsh approach
of the supervisor dances with the frustrated supervisor who can’t seem to bring this slack
employee around. One partner who is highly organized taking care of the lion’s share of the
tasks for both of them, complaining all the way, while the other recedes further into
ineffectiveness. One sees the other as lazy or incompetent. The other responds by labeling the
first a control freak or obsessive-compulsive. Whatever the interaction, what is almost certain to
occur over time is that the partners in this dance will become more extreme in their positions,
being pushed to greater polarization by their perceptions of the other. All the while, each
7

believes that they are just reacting normally to the behavior of the other. The universal whine,
“They started it!” can come from the mouth of the 8 year old or the 58 year old. As professionals
in dispute resolution, we can become utterly lost if we agree to dissect the conflict for its root
cause.
The great gift afforded us as advocates or neutrals by a firm grasp of circular causality is
that it protect us from being hooked into the parties’ dispute. Supported by this perspective, we
can see that both people are right. This perspective allows us to stay out of the blame game,
which our disputants so want us to join. As advocates, we can actually be in their corner without
having to vilify the other. As neutrals, if we become adept at understanding on a deep level the
discomfort experienced by each individual, and projecting that understanding to each one, we
can actually bond with every side of a dispute without alienating any other side. There is a
systems dynamic which impacts groups of three or more when there is conflict between/among
them which is extremely automatic and needs to be grasped (particularly as its magnetic force
seeks to draw the neutral into the dispute). This is the dynamic of the emotional triangle.
The Triangle: Dr. Murray Bowen, the prominent family systems theorists noted that
every two-person system is inherently unstable. In times of calm they may do quite well
together. However no relationship between two people that has any importance to either will
remain forever calm. There will inevitably be stress which will be injected into the relationship.
This stress may not be especially great….or it may be significant. Whatever its intensity, there
will be anxiety which will infect the individuals involved. Again, anxiety in this view may be
seen as an energy which causes discomfiture within one or both people. (This is not anxiety
which causes the shakes or makes you run to the nearest shrink – rather it is best seen as an
uncomfortable state affecting the entire internal system of an individual.)
When anxiety enters a system, there is a natural inclination to reach out and bring in a
third party – to “triangle” in that person (or institution, as we shall shortly see). The most
common triangling process is for one of the two disputants to reach out to the third for support.
Say, A is in conflict with B. The anxiety which exists between the two of them (and within
each) will cause B, automatically, to reach out to C. B may go to coffee with C and complain
about A and her difficulties with that intransigent, unreasonable, obnoxious soul. The triangle is
set when C takes B’s side in the dispute. If this occurs, B is able to drain off some of the
intensity of the energy she is experiencing through her conflict with A and with this transfer of
8

energy, things may seem to calm down (for the moment) between A and B, while now there is
some discordant energy between A and C. If A and C don’t have any real dealings with one
another, then in the short term, B has managed to dissipate some of the discomfiting energy
between he and A. However, if C has any contact with A (which will often be the case) then the
dispute will not dissipate, but transfer to another pair (often with a separate set of issues).
This is often seen in people working in a representative capacity. If A and B have
lawyers C and D, these advocates will often feel it is their ethical obligation to become triangle
into their clients’ disputes. Thus, rather than helping to resolve the problem, the involvement of
these representatives will actually serve to exacerbate the difficulty. The principle of the
emotional triangle is one strong argument in favor of utilizing neutral dispute resolution
professionals and why the conventional legal adversarial method of dispute resolution is often so
poor in resolving these disagreements. (Note that the adversarial approach may eventually end
the dispute, but it will not likely resolve the dispute.)
How does the neutral deal with the triangle? The process was cogently described by
Murray Bowen in this way:

A basic tenet of systems … is that the tension in a two-person relationship will
resolve automatically when contained within a three-person system, one of whom
is emotionally detached. In other words, despite togetherness urges to the
contrary, a problem between two people can be resolved without the “well
intentioned” efforts of a third person to “fix” it. It only requires that the third
person be in adequate emotional contact with the other two and able to remain
emotionally separate from them…

Bowen also noted that the intensity of the anxiety in any individual two-person system may be so
intense that, in order to be fully contained, it will spread through the greater system like water
crystallizing to ice across a lake. Again, he notes,

Anxiety in the central triangle may have been diminished initially by its diffusion
into the system of interlocking triangles, but when this anxiety spreads into the
larger system (the mental health center, service agencies, and the courts), it is
9

often amplified (via the emotional reactivity of the helping professionals) and
focused back on the family. This anxiety in the “helpers” can increase symptoms
in the family. In most situations, helpers are primarily helpful; their involvement
reduces anxiety and symptoms. There are these instances, however, when the
anxiety-induced loss of differentiation and the process of triangling result in the
helpers’ becoming a major component of the family’s problem.

Two parties experiencing stress in their relationship
will result in one reaching out to a third party for support,
creating the emotional triangle

Which will result in a smoothing of the conflict between the original parties and
A transfer of the stress to a different relationship

10

SUBSYSTEMS

Virtually every system is composed of subsystems – and we are each members of both
the greater system and its component subsystems. Each subsystem will have its rules for
inclusion and exclusion (there are certain things you do and don’t do to be in a particular
subsystem). Secure membership in subsystems is essential for wellbeing. However, people are
often faced with the challenge of being forced into a subsystem into which they do not belong.
This is particularly true in a family context and particularly true in divorce, as one of the most
common problems faced by young people when their parents are divorce is elevation to the role
of “parentified child.” Such a person is boosted up into the role of a friend or confidante of a
parent – an extraordinarily confusing experience for a child. At times the child will even be
expected to be the caretaker of their parent. Many a dollar has been spent by adults in
psychotherapy, untangling the internal confusion fostered by such an elevation.
One way of assessing any larger system (family or business organization) is determining
the clarity of different subsystems and rules for inclusion. In addition, each subsystem must
11

interact in some form with the others. The stability of the larger system may be determined, in
part, by the boundaries that exist between the various subsystems. If the boundaries are overly
rigid, then there is very little interaction between the subsystems. If they are too diffuse, there is
insufficient differentiation between the subsystems. Law firms serve as a good example of these
principles. A structure in which there is minimal interaction between the managing echelon and
the associates (a rigid boundary) will cause a good deal of distress and resentment. If the
communication goes in only one direction (top down) or if assignments are allocated without
sufficient mentoring or feedback opportunities, that organization will lose any semblance of
identification with or loyalty to the greater organization from the associate class. Overly diffuse
boundaries can be a problem when there is insufficient differentiation between the information
which is shared within and among the various subsystems.

THE SYSTEM AS A AN ENTITY MOVING THROUGH TIME
Perhaps easiest to conceptualize in this manner is the family system, which has a
particular trajectory over time. Many families will move through the stages of marriage (or
commitment), first child, entry of child(ren) into school (thus bringing the family closer to
interaction with the larger social system), children moving into adolescence, grandparents’ aging
issues, launching of children and moving into late middle age and later years. Each of these
phases will have a natural “horizontal” stressor caused by the challenges brought by each
developmental phase. Of course, there can be any number of additional stressors imposed on the
system over time – job or money problems, illness, promotion. Such stressors will impact
individuals who are the component parts of the greater system, and as such, will impact the entire
system, as all component parts adjust to the changes of the single member. Such change will
certainly contribute to the stress resulting in greater probability for conflict.
The same principle applies to members of a business organization – as this organization,
too, undergoes stages from formation to possible dissolution. As with a family, movement of
the organization into and through various stages will exact a stress on individuals which will
often result in conflict and scapegoating within the organization – as symptoms of the stress
experienced by the system.

CONCLUDING THOUGHTS

One of the greatest services the dispute resolution professional can provide is an entirely
different perspective for people locked into conflict, who can only see the subject of their
conflict. This is particularly true with intimate partners enduring the rupture of their relationship.
These poor distressed souls are so hyper-focused on the subject(s) of their dispute, they are shorn
of the tools that would allow them to escape from their terrible, painful dance.
Each person may bring their own army of supporters to underscore the rightness of their
position, as they are embedded in any number of subsystems in their own lives – their families of
origin, their girl or boyfriends, the subsystem within these groups of the ones who have gotten
divorced. All tug on the individuals before you, giving advice, vilifying the other person.
Careful inquiry into the existence, composition and messages of these subsystems will help
untangle these strands of the web and allow the individuals a clearer, cleaner approach to the task
at hand.
The reactivity which plagues intimate partners in disputes is particularly intense because
almost always, there are very deep, very old personal themes that are activated (usually outside
the awareness of each person). Brent Atkinson in his excellent Emotional Intelligence in
Couples Therapy identifies four discrete themes which bring couples into gridlock (and which, if
not addressed, will carry through to dissolution). Atkinson describes these as different and
legitimate ways by which individuals can experience emotional stability. It is important to
identify these different styles, because almost invariably each partner tends to pathologize the
other – so that both are expending enormous energy in defending themselves – energy that could
be put to use at understanding the other and finding avenues for moving on. Instead they become
locked into their dance. The different styles identified by Atkinson are: Independence First vs.
Togetherness First (in which one person’s basic need is for a sense of space or freedom while the
other needs to have a sense of emotional connection); Invest in the Future vs. Live for the
Moment (in which one person feels like all responsibilities need to be handled before they can
relax and the other is petrified the life will pass them by while they are doing all the things they
“have to” do); Predictability First vs. Spontaneity First (in which on person needs a minimum of
chaos for stability and the other wants nothing more than a fellow traveler to explore the
adventures of life); Problem Solving First vs. Understanding First (aka, lawyers and their
13

spouses). The key to these and other differences are that they represent completely
understandable (and polar opposite) methods for achieving emotional stability and it is painfully
easy for anyone of feel completely misunderstood and judged by the other. Any reader
struggling with one of the above challenges in their intimate relationship will not have difficulty
coming up with the judgments they throw at the other and the different judgments they have, in
turn, thrown at them. People in the grip of these gridlocked conflicts feel profoundly
misunderstood and dismissed by their partners – causing enormous defensiveness and reactivity.
It is vitally important that any dispute resolution professional dealing with issues such as
these be mindful of their own struggles along these lines. As noted by Atkinson, these attitudes
represent the efforts of individuals to establish a sense of emotional stability for themselves. As
such, it is likely that each attitude represents a response to early, meaningful life experiences.
Oftentimes these experiences as quite early in our life and, therefore, beyond our immediate
conscious awareness. As this is true for our clients, it will also be true for us. Therefore, we will
need to be particularly vigilant to avoid automatic alliance with the individual who happens to
share our own (unconscious) style. We will, of course, be easy marks for those who share our
predilection and who want to triangle us in.
If we are able to maintain our awareness of process over content and the systemic vs. the
individual context for understanding interpersonal stresses and disputes, we may well be able to
pull many rabbits out of hats that our clients didn’t even know existed. That’s why a systems
perspective can be an invaluable inclusion in any dispute professionals tool kit.

Quadrophenia was The Who’s 1973 rock opera double-album. The name blends
the Quadrophonic sound schemes then being introduced, with the term
‘schizophrenia’, and is said to have been a criticism of popular misapplication of the
term ‘schizophrenia’ to describe multiple personality disorders; it also alluded to
four distinct personas of the opera’s protagonist. Domestic Relations Orders
(DROs) have multiple personalities / personas as well, and divorce practitioners and
judges epidemically misapply DRO terminology and concepts. This is
QDROphenia! This unfortunate phenomenon stems from misconceptions about
the nature and characteristics of retirement assets in the case. These mistakes aren't
innocent because they often result in inadequate negotiations, ineffective or
inequitable awards, ‘surprise’ post-divorce attorney fees, post-dissolution litigation
(motions to set aside or reopen cases, motions to enforce) and all the related and
resulting losses to the people that we serve.

PART 1: OVERVIEW OF RETIREMENT ASSETS
A. Retirement Assets; Generally.
Retirement assets are frequently and increasingly the most valuable marital asset. The goal
of this presentation is to assist general divorce practitioners to (a) identify retirement asset issues,
(b) tap into available resources during discovery and (c) give marital retirement assets fair treatment
in the pre-General Judgment and General Judgment drafting stages, so that the DRO phase of the
case goes smoothly, without further substantive negotiations and unnecessary attorney fees.
Just when the parties thought the case was finished, ‘QDRO’ issues rear their ugly heads.
Simple and clear agreements or retirement provisions in the Marital Settlement Agreement (MSA)
and General Judgment (GJ) are frequently followed by a whole array of snags, disagreements and
further negotiations or litigation that arise in context of preparing the order(s) that assign the
retirement benefit(s). These “loose ends” can cost your client a small fortune to resolve because
they compel many hours of attention by you and/or the DRO attorney. Clients are devastated
when they continue to incur legal fees many months after the divorce because the attorneys are still
dealing with the so-called ‘QDRO.’
All retirement plans are different and there is no one-size-fits-all language for the MSA/GJ
when it comes to the disposition of retirement assets. The parties and their attorneys often do not
recognize whether they are dealing with a defined contribution plan (DCP), defined benefit plan
(DBP), cash balance plan (CBP) or some other type of non-qualified plan. They are almost never
aware in advance when their retirement plans cannot be divided by QDRO/DRO.
It is imperative that you know what retirement assets can be transferred in connection with
the divorce, and how the transfer must be accomplished. If the MSA / GJ fails to address even
one substantive issue, by way of example, whether the non-employee spouse will receive a surviving
spouse benefit, then this lack of specificity can lead to post-divorce litigation. Divorce lawyers must
grasp the basics of retirement plans so they can properly represent their clients throughout the
discovery, negotiation, trial prep/trial stages, and in the process of drafting or approving the
MSA/GJ. The solution is to secure information about the parties’ retirement benefits during the
initial stages of the divorce. A little preparation on the front end can save your client a lot of
money and grief at the tail end of the case and in the DRO process.
A retirement plan is a financial arrangement designed to replace employment income upon
retirement. These plans (including IRAs) are (a) governed by specific statutes, rules and
regulations, and (b) established by employers, insurance companies, trade unions, government
entities or other organized financial institutions.
Retirement investment income is deferred compensation and will be treated as regular
income to the recipient at the time of distribution. The transfer / assignment of retirement benefits
from a retirement plan participant to his or her spouse or former spouse under a proper DRO is
not considered a “distribution” or a taxable event under the tax code. ORS 107.105(3) and a
whole slew of federal and state laws permit the transfer of retirement benefits through assignment
upon divorce to the participant’s former spouse (or upon legal separation to the participant’s
spouse), if the assignment is made pursuant to a qualifying court order. That's the DRO/QDRO.
QDROphenia – Page 4

PRACTICE TIP: Is the Plan governed by ERISA? If so, refer to the court order that will
ultimately govern the assignment of plan benefits as a “QDRO”. If the Plan is not an ERISA plan,
then refer to the assignment order as “DRO”.
B.
What is a QDRO? A "qualified domestic relation order" (QDRO) is a domestic
relations order that creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to receive, or
assigns to an alternate payee the right to receive, all or a portion of the benefits payable with
respect to a participant under a retirement plan, and that includes certain information and meets
certain other requirements; it must relate to the provision of child support, alimony payments or
marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child or other dependent of the plan
participant; and it must be entered pursuant to a State domestic relations law. This presentation
focuses on QDROs/DROs that relate to the division of marital property rights. 1
A State authority (generally, a court) must actually issue an order or formally approve an
MSA before it can be deemed a domestic relations order. A property settlement signed by a
participant and the participant's former spouse or a draft order to which both parties consent is not
a domestic relations order until the State authority (court) has adopted it as an order or formally
approved it and made it part of the domestic relations proceeding.

C.
What is a DRO? A domestic relations order is a judgment, decree, or order
(including the approval of a property settlement) that is made pursuant to state domestic relations
law (including community property law) and that relates to the provision of child support, alimony
payments, or marital property rights for the benefit of a spouse, former spouse, child, or other
dependent of a participant.
A state authority, generally a court, must actually issue a judgment, order, or decree or
otherwise formally approve an MSA before it can be a deemed a domestic relations order under
ERISA. The mere fact that an MSA is signed by the parties will not, of itself, transform the MSA
into a DRO. Moreover, there is no requirement that both parties to a marital proceeding sign or
otherwise endorse or approve a QDRO / DRO. When they do, however, it generally makes the
entire QDRO / DRO process much simpler.

In addition to the federal or state laws that govern the creation / formation of retirement
plans, there are many such laws that govern the process of assigning plan benefits to the
participant’s spouse or former spouse; the DRO attorney ensures that the actual DRO/QDRO
complies with those laws, so that the plan administrator can carve out the AP’s assigned interest
and administer that interest for the benefit of the AP.
Retirement plans are neither permitted nor required to follow an order that purports to
assign retirement benefits unless it is a QDRO or other form of DRO that the plan deems
acceptable for processing/administration. Reference: ERISA §§ 206(d)(3)(B)(ii), 514(a), 514(b)(7);
IRC § 414(p)(1)(B); http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq_qdro.html
PART 2: DISCOVERY
A. THE WHO: KNOW THE PLAYERS
Attorneys. Consult with a DRO attorney early in the case. Some will provide pre-retainer
consultations free of charge or at negotiated rates. In that context you can gain a wealth of
knowledge and resources about the retirement benefits your case. From the client’s perspective,
this is a solid investment because it can make an enormous financial difference in the outcome of
his case. The DRO attorney can work very easily with parties, courts and attorneys situated
outside of the county where the DRO attorney maintains his or her practice. We file DROs
statewide and e-filing has made that process even simpler. As long as it's an Oregon case, we can
assist you and your clients with finalizing the division of retirement assets by preparing and filing
the appropriate DROs. We often never meet our DRO clients face-to-face but instead conduct all
business by phone and through email and (less frequently) mail. Attached as Appendix-1 is a list of
Oregon attorneys who can assist you and your clients in the DRO/QDRO context.
Retirement Plan Administrators and their Agents. Plan Administrator(s) and their agents will
provide you with (or further direct you to) resources from which you or the DRO attorney can
identify and understand the retirement plan. Posing the right general questions to the plan’s
administrative team frequently results in the discovery of valuable, general information concerning
not only the retirement plan itself, but oftentimes leads to the discovery of additional, related
retirement plans, sponsored by the same employer or trade union. In addition to the plan
administrator, other resources include account custodians (Fidelity, Vanguard, John Hancock …),
the human resources or employee benefits department within a party's current and former
employer(s), trade union benefit representatives, insurance companies, or government entities
(such as PERS, OPM, etc). You can always inquire generally about employee retirement benefits,
or retirement plan QDRO procedures, but without an authorization/release or a subpoena, you
must not inquire about a particular party’s association or benefits.
B. IDENTIFY & UNDERSTAND ALL RETIREMENT PLANS IN YOUR CASE BEFORE
YOU NEGOTIATE OR PREPARE FOR TRIAL

Launch early discovery efforts. Identify each Plan by its registered name and understand what
type of Plan it is and for what type(s) of benefits it provides. You cannot properly negotiate about
an asset, make the court understand what it can and cannot do with that asset, or articulate a

QDROphenia – Page 6

disposition-upon-divorce for that asset, until you identify the asset by name and characteristics.
Retirement interests are no exception!

PRACTICE TIP: Determine the names of each spouse’s current and former employers (and
trade unions), the approximate dates of employment, and the general locations of all employers
(and trade unions). This information will lead you or the DRO attorney to the sources for
discovering what retirement plans are available through association with these past and present
employers and unions, and you can then tailor your discovery requests and investigation efforts
accordingly.
PRACTICE TIP: It’s not due diligence to rely upon a standard ‘form’ discovery request for
production (RFP), because in most cases you won’t get the information you need in time, if at all;
this is a classic set up for missing a retirement asset and/or failing to identify or understand it.
Retirement assets can be broken down into several categories, about which more is said
below. What type or classification of retirement plan(s) are you dealing with? Under what laws,
rules or regs is the retirement plan formed? Is it a plan created under IRC Section 401(a)/(k)?
403(b)? 457? Is it a government or other non-ERISA plan? Military? IRA? If it is an IRA, what
kind of IRA: Roth, Rollover, Traditional, Beneficiary, SEP? The DRO attorney can lend
valuable, targeted assistance in this process.
If you fail to name a retirement asset in your GJ, then you have done your client a
disservice and quite possibly committed malpractice. That client will likely find her/himself back
in the lawyer’s office seeking a corrected GJ, sometimes years, even decades down the line; this can
take the form of having to respond to a post-dissolution procedure initiated by the former spouse,
or seeking help from a DRO lawyer when the plan administrator denies an application for
retirement benefits because there is no court order that addresses the specific plan. Oftentimes a
general catch-all statement in the MSA/GJ that ‘husband is awarded, free and clear of any claim by

wife, all of his financial and retirement accounts not specifically and expressly awarded to wife
below’ is not sufficient to enable a plan to release to the participant what it presumes to be the

former spouse’s equity interest.

We see many GJ’s that award ‘Wife one-half of Husband’s Weyerhaeuser Retirement
Plan” or “retirement Plan through Weyerhaeuser.” We are left guessing at the effective date of
division, the method of division, which Weyerhaeuser plan (there are more than one), the form of
benefit, and so much more! The DRO attorney knows (or learns upon contacting the employer or
Plan) that the employer or trade union actually sponsors 2 or more plans (perhaps a 401(k), a
defined benefit plan and a non-qualified, indivisible plan). In such scenario, negotiations must
commence and, if not successful, litigation or loss will ensue.

PRACTICE TIP: Once you identify the existence of a Defined Contribution Plan (DCP) or
Defined Benefit Plan (DBP) or any other retirement plan, you should contact the Plan
Administrator or the employee/member benefits representative (often one in the same) and ask
whether participants in such plan also participate in any other, related plans.

QDROphenia – Page 7

Once you know the name of the retirement plan, you can identify the Plan Administrator
and its contact information; alternatively, once you know the name of the Plan Administrator (or
custodian) you can identify the retirement plan(s). Most retirement plans have plan custodians or
record-keeping agents for the purpose of administering the financial and investment aspects of the
plan. You will want to identify these custodians / record-keepers as well and sometimes they will
be your first (and last) point of contact with the Plan, and the means by which you identify the
Plan(s) and the Plan Administrator(s).
Your best tools in the retirement asset discovery context are:
(a) Client interviews/questionnaires;
(b) Phone interviews with employer (or union) employee benefits agents (without a
release, you may only ask general questions about employee/member retirement
benefit options)
(c) Requests for Production and thorough review of retirement benefit statements,
account summary statements, pay stubs, employer materials, employment contracts.
(d) Internet searches frequently yield information about employers, trade unions and
their retirement benefit options for employees/members. Oftentimes, this type of
search leads to the discovery of collateral retirement plan(s) and benefits, as well as
contact information for Plan administrators and custodians.
(e) Summary Plan Descriptions. Plan documents and (Q)DRO procedures
(f) Authorizations to release information to third parties with accompanying records
requests. Have a solid template in your forms arsenal. Example at Appendix 2.
(g) Conference calls with the plan participant and the plan administrator (or custodian)
are incredibly useful. When you represent the participant, it’s a cinch. If the
participant is not your client, you can still arrange for a conference call with a willing
opposing party; you should always clarify before the conference call what questions
you will ask and what information you will solicit. This is a good place to bring a
DRO attorney into the conversation because he or she will know whom to contact
(or how to figure out whom to contact), what information to solicit, how to make
sense of it to enable you to use the information about the retirement asset to
enhance your negotiation or trial preparation strategies.
(h) Depositions
(i) Subpoenas for records. See Appendix 3.

PRACTICE TIP: Consider freezing the participant’s access to plan benefits, requesting that the
Plan Administrator flag the participant’s file / account to prevent distributions (including roll overs)
or loans without a court order or the written consent of the non-participant spouse, or otherwise
notifying the Plan Administrator(s) that dissolution is pending and that the non-participant spouse
has asserted a claim against the retirement benefits. Such steps can prevent participants from
taking early distributions from or loans against their account balances. If the participant rolls the
funds into another qualified plan or IRA, the non-participant spouse can still be assigned a benefit
under a DRO; but if he takes a taxable distribution and it’s no longer traceable then it will be
difficult to satisfy the court’s intent to divide this asset. Some plans won’t accept anything but a
court order (restraining order or DRO) to enable them to place administrative holds or restrictions
on a plan participant’s account. Find out what the plan administrator requires.

QDROphenia – Page 8

C. KEY PLAN DOCUMENTS
The Plan administrator must provide prospective APs with certain information: the Summary
Plan Description (SPD); a copy of the Plan document and QDRO procedures; and certain
information regarding the participant’s benefit. The Plan Administrator may condition disclosure
of other information specific to the participant on its receipt of an authorization signed by the
participant or some reasonable information establishing that the request is made in connection
with a divorce proceeding. Indeed, sometimes getting your hands on the detailed information you
need requires issuance of a subpoena.
Obtain and review the SPD early to really understand the particular plan(s). But beware of the
Plan’s model QDRO provisions, which are not comprehensive and are frequently designed to
favor participants and plans (frozen covertures, failure to award benefit adjustments, disclaimers,
etc.). The Plan’s model or suggested QDRO provisions can help you spot some of the issues as
you develop your case but the entitlements and assignment methods set forth in the model
provisions are neither exhaustive nor all-inclusive.
CAVEAT: Plans and their administrators may hike the administrative fees when parties fail to use
the Plan’s (or its agent’s) established administrative procedures in the QDRO administration
context (Fidelity Investments is one example - $300 administrative fee if you use the ‘QDRO
Center’ online to prepare a computer-program-generated QDRO vs. $1,200 if you don’t).
PART 3: TYPES OF PLANS
What type of plan(s) are you dealing with: Defined Contribution Plan? Defined Benefit
Plan? Cash balance plan? ‘Hybrid’ plans? IRA? Is the Plan a Qualified Plan or a Non-qualified
Plan? Understanding the differences between plans is key. For a comprehensive listing and
summary of types of retirement plans and further discussion about each type, see this publication
from IRS: http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Sponsor/Types-of-Retirement-Plans-1
In property settlement negotiations, the attorneys and the parties often refer to the
“retirement plan(s)” but fail to investigate, identify and understand the type of plan(s) that are on
the table. A party who participates in a DCP or has IRAs normally receives periodic account
statements showing the account balance at regular intervals. Dividing DCPs and IRAs in divorce is
fairly simple because the precise value of the account is easy to identify and the transfer
mechanism is straightforward. It is significantly more complicated to divide DBP interests because
the value of the benefit can only be determined based on actuarial calculations and (if before
retirement eligibility) assumptions regarding when the participant will retire or terminate
employment and what her salary will be at that time.
The distinction between various types of retirement plans is critical to understanding what
you are really dividing; it could be the portion of an account consisting of an identifiable balance,
or the right to receive a monthly payment stream (defined benefit) in the future, or a portion of an
account with an identifiable balance that fluctuates over time. The relevance of key issues such as
earnings and losses, loan balances, pre-retirement and post-retirement surviving spouse benefits,
and cost-of-living increases (COLAs), all depends on the type of plan being divided and the plan’s
contractual provisions.
QDROphenia – Page 9

PRACTIC TIP: In your MSA or GJ, don’t merely use the word ‘account’ to describe the
retirement interest to be transferred, unless you are certain that the interest consists of a DCP or
IRA. If you are dealing with a DBP or hybrid/cash balance plan, then using the term ‘account’ or
‘account balance’ will be ineffective, or worse.
We frequently encounter MSAs and GJs containing such statements as “Wife shall receive
50% of Husband’s Pension Plan as of the date of the divorce, plus or minus earnings and losses
from that date until the date the account is divided.” This is ineffective and indecipherable by the
DRO attorney. The concept of “earnings and losses” does not apply to DBPs: payments under
DBPs do not fluctuate with the market, and thus there are no “earnings and losses.” Drafting
MSAs and GJs that contain language that is inapplicable to the type of Plan being divided will likely
have significant, adverse consequences for one or both parties.
A. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS (DCPs)
You will encounter DCPs more frequently than Defined Benefit Plans (DBPs). DCPs
include 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, 457 plans, profit sharing plans and ESOPs, and retirement
annuity contracts under TIAA-CREF. The contributions (that the employee / participant makes
and that the employer may match) are defined, and are deposited into a participant’s individual
account under the Plan. The end result is not defined and the account balance at retirement is
unknown because the account balance is subject to ongoing, undeterminable market fluctuations.
DCP benefits offer more flexibility, generally allowing rollovers (into other DCPs or IRAs) upon
termination from employment. DCP participants have more rights if they predecease their
entitlement under the plan and their beneficiary(ies) can be anyone they choose, not just spouses,
former spouses or dependent children. Additionally the MSA/GJ can provide that AP will receive
the DCP funds awarded to her regardless of when Participant dies (“the death of Husband shall
have no impact on Wife’s right to receive her portion of Husband’s ABC 401(k) Plan”).
See Appendix 4 for a Condensed list of Considerations in drafting DCP QDROs.
If the non-participant spouse (referred to as the alternate payee [AP]) intends to liquidate
some or all of his DCP award to pay debts or purchase a home, then know whether the plan will
permit an immediate, lump sum distribution. The DCP may require establishment of a separate
account for AP, while some plans won’t allow establishment of a separate account for AP and will
instead require immediate lump-sum distribution, which AP can roll over into another qualified
plan or IRA. Determine if the DCP requires a triggering event occur for an AP to get a lump sum
distribution. QDRO rules require that the AP award must be expressed as a dollar amount or a
percentage; but the MSA/GJ may set forth a formula or mechanism by which to determine that
sum or percentage.
1. VALUATION DATE
The MSA/GJ must expressly state the date on which the AP’s award will be determined
(the “valuation date”). If a percentage is awarded and the intent is to cut the AP off from further
employee / employer contributions after a certain date, then specify that certain date as the
valuation date (“$100,000 as of 1 April 2015”). If the parties cannot agree, the general rule in
Oregon is to value the interest as of the date of dissolution. This is less of an issue if a specific
dollar amount is awarded.
QDROphenia – Page 10

Plans are valued daily, monthly, quarterly or annually. Profit sharing plans tend to have
year-end valuations. If the Plan doesn’t make its annual contributions until the end of year, and
the parties’ divorce occurs toward the end of the year, then the question is whether the nonparticipant spouse is entitled to the contributions made after the divorce. If a dollar amount is
awarded, this is not a valuation date issue as much as it is an issue about whether interest will
accrue on the award between the valuation date and the account segregation date, more about
which is discussed below. Your job is to find out, or have the DRO attorney find out, the valuation
date policies under the plan and to address those as needed prior to entry of the MSA/GJ. In
general, to the extent that DCP contributions made after the valuation date satisfy funding /
contribution obligations for dates prior to the valuation date, or represent accrued interest on the
AP’s share, they should be awarded and assigned to the AP.
If the MSA/GJ is silent on the ‘valuation date’ issue, then the QDRO attorney may opt to
insert a valuation date (perhaps the date of divorce or property settlement agreement, or perhaps
the date on the account statements that the parties were using in their negotiations; the opposing
party may agree or object to the date, but the DRO cannot be administered by a retirement plan if
does not assert a valuation date. The parties would need to re-negotiate or seek judicial relief to
resolve this. This is a problem that can and should be resolved before filing the MSA/GJ.
2. ADMINISTRATIVE FEES
Who will pay the administrative fees, if any, assessed by the Plan (or its agent) for its review
and administration of the QDRO/DROs? Such fees generally come off the top before benefits are
paid. The GJ/MSA should address whether such administrative fees will be shared equally, on a
pro rata basis, or by one party.
3. VESTED vs NON-VESTED ACCOUNT BALANCES
When awarding the AP a percentage interest in a DCP, use the term “total account balance
under the Plan” rather than “vested account balance.” Using the term “vested” could significantly
reduce the amount assigned to the AP. Moreover, the Oregon Supreme Court in Richardson and
Richardson, 307 OR 370, 769 P2d 179 (1989) held that “even though [participant’s] rights had not
vested when the parties separated, he had a property interest in the pension at that time…to the
extent that it is attributable to [participant’s] pre-separation employment, the present value of the
pension is a jointly acquired marital asset.” The Richardson Court noted that “the portion of the
present value of participant’s pension attributable to his post-separation employment was an
individually-acquired asset with respect to which the statutory presumption of equal contribution
was rebutted because that portion of his pension was earned solely by his efforts when the parties
were no longer living as a marital unit.” That reasoning is not entirely applicable to alreadyaccumulated but unvested portions of date-of-divorce DCP account balances, even if vesting of
unvested portions depends upon participant fulfilling additional, post-divorce employment time.
Though Richardson involved a hybrid DCP/DBP plan (PERS), the reasoning is arguably
applicable to a DCP account balance, and the AP will want to avoid the term “vested” when
possible. If the Plan won’t qualify an order that omits the term “vested” then then so be it; contact
the Plan or have the DRO attorney do so, to find out whether the participant is vested and whether
this is actually an issue in your case.

QDROphenia – Page 11

4. OUTSTANDING LOANS
Determine whether there are loans for which the DCP account balance serves as collateral.
If so, then what is the net value (after reduction for the outstanding loan balance) comprises the
sum that is available for transfer and assignment to the AP. If the judgment awards the AP a sum
certain from the DCP, then it does not need to address loan balances, but make sure that the
amount is not more than the net equity in the account. Loan balance information generally
appears on the DCP account statement. If participant argues that it is not equitable to award AP
any interest in the pre-marital DCP account balance (more on that topic, below), then AP’s lawyer
should determine whether there was a loan balance owed at the date of marriage and whether / to
what extent it was repaid during the marriage. If AP can argue that it was paid off with marital
assets, then AP can seek an adjustment so that AP captures a portion of the increased ‘marital
equity’ in the account.
It is Participant’s responsibility to repay the loans and that responsibility cannot be assigned
to an AP. Under applicable law, Participant, not AP, is liable to the plan for repayment of the
entire loan. DROs/QDROs cannot assign a loan liability to a former spouse. This is why plans
won’t transfer a sum greater than the net account balance to AP. Thus, if you want to make the
parties equally liable for the loan, then award AP a percentage (usually 50%) of the account
balance that is net of the loan. Be very careful with semantics around this issue.
Know what you are saying when you use words like “including” and “excluding” in
referring to DCP loans. Some plans consider loans to be part of the plan that is divisible; other
plans consider loans to be temporarily out of physical reach of the division. If you say ‘AP is
awarded 50% of the ABC 401(k) Plan including loan balances,’ then you are saying that AP will
receive 50% of the total account balance without any adjustment for the loan balance; as a result,
AP would get more than half of the DCP account balance. If you say ‘[AP] is awarded 50% of the
ABC 401(k) Plan excluding loan balances,’ then you are saying that AP receives 50% of the total
account balance net of the loan and, as a result, the parties equally divide the DCP ‘equity’ and
participant pays the loan, but in theory keeps the balance of the DCP that serves as collateral for
the loan. See a useful illustration by Larry Gorin, of ‘loan inclusion vs. exclusion’ at Appendix 5.
5. OFFSETTING
If you are thinking of trading a DCP interest for post-tax martial property (like real or
tangible personal property), then you may need to retain a valuation expert. Generally, you will
not want to trade DCP interests for DBP interests, but if you must, then you will need a valuation
of the Plans involved in the offset calculation.
6. PRE-TAX ASSETS, BUT ONLY GENERALLY SPEAKING
DCP accounts are generally funded with employee and/or employer contributions
of pre-tax dollars on behalf of the participant. Some 401k plans and IRA accounts permit aftertax "Roth" contributions, so be sure you know what you're dealing with and whether the AP will
receive a pro-rata share of such after-tax contributions. The AP needs to understand that eventual
distributions are subject to taxation. If determine the AP’s award of retirement benefits based on
an offset with other, post-tax assets (house, yacht, gold bars) then consider an appropriate
reduction / adjustment to the DCP account balance. You may need to involve a CPA or taxpreparer in this context.

QDROphenia – Page 12

7. PRE-MARITAL ACCOUNT BALANCES & PASSIVE INCREASES
Determine the date of marriage (DOM) account balance and the date of divorce (DOD) or
property settlement account balance. Is it just and proper to award the AP a portion of the
premarital balance in the DCP? Sometimes it is: pre-DOM domestic partnership; pre-DOM birth
of the parties’ children; or perhaps the non-participant spouse cashed out his IRA during the
marriage in order to fund the home remodel or pay for a child’s education.
If participant has premarital service time under the Plan, then unless the parties are in full
agreement on a settlement without full disclosure / discovery, you will need to discover the DOM
balance. If the DCP account has no premarital component, then don’t use term ‘marital portion’
in your judgment. If you are unsure, then it can be appropriate to use the term ‘marital portion’
but understand and make sure your client understands that you have left loose ends for the DRO
attorney. Make sure there is an agreement or formula for determining the so-called ‘martial
portion’ (Wife is awarded 50% of difference between the ABC 401(k) [total account balance or
total, vested account balance] as of the date of marriage and the [total account balance or total,
vested account balance] as of the date of dissolution of marriage).
If there is or may be a premarital portion, then determine early on whether the Plan record
keeper even has records going that far back; oftentimes they don’t because plan administration
changes hands over the years. Sometimes it is virtually impossible to determine the DOM balance
unless the parties saved old records.
The post-date-of-marriage increase in value under a DCP is subject to the statutory
presumption of equal contribution. In Oregon, the increase in the DCP account balance between
the date of marriage and the DOD is the ‘marital asset’ portion and subject to the rebuttable
presumption of equal contribution; in other states participants are awarded the DCP account
balance as of the DOM, as well as the increase on that share that is attributable to passive earnings
(gains and losses), and the AP receives half of the marital contributions plus passive earnings on
that portion; in such scenario, passive earnings on the non-marital portion are excluded from the
‘marital pot’ and one would need to hire an expert to conduct a passive market value assessment,
to analyze for the rate of return during that period. The only way to make an accurate assessment
of this is to have every single account statement that was generated during the marriage; the final
number will be flawed if we have to make any guesses.
8. SPECIAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS
Distributions to APs from certain DCP’s are exempt from the early withdrawal penalty
rules under the IRC. If you are advising your client about this, make sure you know the rules. If
not, then refer them to a CPA for further advice. For more information on this topic,
see: http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Retirement-Topics---Tax-onEarly-Distributions Timing and logistics are critical if the alternate-payee spouse wishes to take a
distribution and avoid the 10% early withdrawal penalty.

QDROphenia – Page 13

B. INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS (IRAs).
IRAs are not employer-sponsored qualified retirement plans and despite popular
misconception, cannot be divided by QDRO. IRAs are not subject to IRC 414(p), nor are they
covered by ERISA section 206. IRA custodians often advise that they need a “QDRO” to
authorize the division and transfer of IRA assets from one spouse to another. This is a prime
example of common misuse of the term ‘QDRO.’ But arguing with plan custodians over
semantics is never worth it. Just know that ERISA does not apply to IRA transfers, and therefore
the transfer order is not properly designated as a QDRO. DRO is the appropriate designation of
an order assigning IRA assets in the post-divorce (or legal separation) setting.
The only divorce-related exception /special treatment for IRAs is that a transfer of assets
from an IRA owner’s IRA to his spouse or former spouse under a divorce or separation
instrument (see 26 U.S.C.A. / IRC § 408(d)(6) and ORS 107.105(3)), is a non-taxable transfer.
Such transfer must be accomplished by: (1) changing the name on the IRA from the transferor
spouse to the transferee spouse (such as if transferring the entire interest in the IRA), or (2) trusteeto-trustee transfer (custodian-to-custodian transfer) from the transferor’s IRA to the transferee’s
IRA.
CAVEAT: An ‘indirect rollover’ doesn't qualify as a transfer to your former spouse even if the
distributed amount is deposited into your former spouse’s IRA within 60days. http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-IRAs-Distributions(Withdrawals)
While the MSA/GJ can contain IRA transfer (DRO) language, if is frequently better to
prepare a separate Supplemental Judgment (DRO). The DRO language should be drafted to
enable the IRA custodian to administer the required transfer without further submissions by the
parties. The language is very technical but if done correctly, the assignment / transfer process can
be simple and expedient. The DRO attorney can assist you in this process and even provide you
with the DRO language to insert into your MSA or General Judgment; alternatively, h/she can
provide you with a DRO to submit along with the General Judgment. The IRA DRO must
include, among other things, the precise name of the IRA (‘Vanguard Rollover IRA fbo Juan
Gutierrez, account number 098*****689’), the percentage or precise dollar amount to be
transferred, and a recitation that the award will be valued as of the date of transfer. The court
should retain jurisdiction to correct or amend the order, or to enter further orders, to effectuate
the court’s and / or the parties’ intent as set forth in the order.
Unlike DCP splits under QDROs/DROs, the IRA account custodian cannot award a sum
or a portion of an IRA as of a past date, or make any pro rata adjustment for investment earnings
or losses that accrue prior to the date of transfer.
Transfers between spouse’s IRAs should be made to a comparable IRA established in the
name of the recipient spouse, and the DRO can specify the receiving IRA account if it is known.
IRA custodians require a court-certified copy of the DRO (whether it’s included in the
General Judgment or a separate supplemental judgment). IRA custodians may also require a dulyexecuted administrative transfer instruction to the custodian and an acceptance of transfer
QDROphenia – Page 14

instruction signed by the receiving party, as a prerequisite to executing the assignment. With
increasing frequency, IRA custodians are requiring the transferor and the transferee to complete
the custodian’s own administrative forms (often called ‘transfer instructions’ or “divorce transfer
forms'). Frequently, such forms can be found on the custodian’s website. These completed forms
are then furnished to the custodian as a prerequisite to the transfer; they are submitted either with
the DRO or afterward, at the subsequent request of the custodian. Make sure your client
understands that there are costs associated with involving an attorney or a CPA in the
administrative transfer process, but that it may be necessary if the client is not grasping the nature
of the financial transaction.
Clients often have a difficult time in the IRA transfer / roll over process and may seek help
from you or your staff. Be careful here. The safest course for your client (and thus you), if he is
the transferee, is for the DRO to order a direct roll over to the transferee’s receiving IRA. In any
event, the transferee may require assistance with the administrative forms and process, and should
be counselled on the income tax aspects of the transfer. If you are unsure, consult with a DRO
attorney or a CPA. The process can pose tax-traps for the unwary. Clients who have a financial
advisor and work them in the IRA transfer/roll-over context may fare better than those who do not.
When transfer is made from one spouse’s IRA to the receiving spouse’s IRA, the monies
are still categorized as IRA funds and still subject to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) rules regarding
early distribution penalties if the recipient spouse elects a distribution before attaining the age of 59
½. The transferee spouse’s uninformed decision to withdraw the transferred IRA funds before age
59 ½ [whether by foregoing a rollover and instead electing a lump-sum distribution check from the
custodian or through a complete or partial withdrawal following the rollover] will result in taxable
income and a 10% early withdrawal penalty.
A transfer instruction and a court-certified copy of the General Judgment, MSA and/or
DRO should suffice to transfer funds from an IRA in a divorce case, provided that these
instruments contain the ‘magic words,’ which vary from case to case and from custodian to
custodian. In most situations, it is simplest and most expedient to prepare a separate court order,
similar to a QDRO but much simpler, which directs the transfer of IRA funds in connection with
the divorce.
C. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS (DBPs)
1. INTRODUCTION
DBPs provide a fixed, pre-established benefit for employees at retirement. DBPs do not
maintain a separate account for a particular plan participant/employee. Instead, the DBP
participant accumulates creditable (employment) service time (generally expressed in months or
years of service) under the DBP, which translates to the accumulation of credits toward the
ultimate retirement benefit. The DBP guarantees a fixed monthly benefit that’s predetermined by
a formula factoring in the participant’s earnings history, length of creditable service under the plan,
and age. The ultimate benefit is not based on any individual investment return on an account.
Traditional pension plans are the most common type of DBP. The participant should
understand generally that if he works long enough for the sponsoring employer (or trade union),
QDROphenia – Page 15

then upon retirement eligibility he will receive a monthly benefit (called an annuity) of a certain
dollar amount for the rest of his life following retirement. The monthly benefit amount is defined
(unlike in a DCP, wherein the contribution is defined). After accumulating sufficient, creditable
service time to vest in the plan, the participant is guaranteed a monthly benefit payment that’s
based on length of service and salary at the time of retirement.

PRACTICE TIP: Be proactive in ascertaining whether a party has an interest in a DBP. DBPs
(along with non-qualified plans) are the most elusive in the discovery context and frequently the
subject of omitted asset disputes. The omissions are both intentional and unintentional by the
participant. DBPs don’t send their participants the same kind of periodic financial statements that
we see for IRAs and DCPs.
To strategize and negotiate about DBPs, closely consider the facts of your case. Is the
participant a retiree under the DBP? If so, division options are much more limited and generally
require assignment to the AP of a ‘shared interest award’ rather than a ‘separate interest award’
(described in detail, below), because the retiree is generally locked in to the form of benefit that he
elected upon retirement.
Is this a long-term or short-term marriage? What is the estimated benefit at the time of the
divorce? Can you now discover the estimated benefit if the participant continues to work for the
sponsoring employer until retirement? Have you had, or should you have, the DBP interest
valued? If the estimated benefit at the time of the dissolution is extremely low, perhaps it’s best to
simply proceed with an equal division-type of award and provision for entry a subsequent QDRO.
How close to retirement is the participant? Is it unlikely that the AP will ever accumulate
retirement of his/her own after the divorce? If so, is that because of age or disability or because of
long-term child rearing responsibilities that will impact investment / retirement asset accumulation?
These factors, among many others, have to inform our advice to our clients about how to proceed
with respect to the DBP interests and “what’s fair” in terms of a ‘just and proper’ distribution of
that interest (or any other retirement interest).
Make sure that you and your client (and if trying the case, then the court) know what form
and type of benefit the client seeks. If you are dividing a DBP interest, the first issue is whether to
present-value the participant’s interest in the DBP and use an offset of some other asset (the house,
a DCP, etc.), or to divide the DBP interest between the parties. AP’s ultimate benefit will be a
separate or shared interest in a monthly benefit or a lump-sum payment upon retirement eligibility;
or, if the participant dies before retirement, a qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity (QPRSA)
(or a portion thereof). QDROs for these plans generally create a separate interest for the AP at the
time the benefit goes into pay status (more on this, below).

PRACTICE TIP: If you are dealing with a DBP do not use the term ‘account’ in your MSA/GJ
award language. And if you are dealing with a hybrid plan/DBP that is tied to a contributions
account, do not simply award a portion of the ‘account’ because it fails to award the AP any
portion of the defined benefit. Such errors have repeatedly resulted in inadequate awards and loss
to the AP, even when the parties turned the dispute over to the court for interpretation and relief.

QDROphenia – Page 16

A provision in a MSA/GJ providing that the AP gets “50% of the participant’s monthly
retirement benefit” is too vague and insufficient to allow the Plan, the QDRO attorney or even the
Court to determine the intent of the parties. You need to determine the following: (a) whether the
benefit will be (or can be) paid in the form of a separate interest award or a shared interest award;
(b) whether restrictions are placed on the participant’s ability to elect a form of benefit of his/her
choosing; (c) whether AP will receive pre-retirement and/or post-retirement death benefits and if
so, in what proportion; (d) whether AP’s interest will revert to participant if AP predeceases
participant before retirement; and, (e) whether AP’s interest will revert to participant if AP
predeceases participant after retirement.
See Appendix 6 for a Condensed list of Considerations in drafting DBP QDROs.
2. FORM OF BENEFIT ELECTED (OR COMPELLED) UPON RETIREMENT
DBP participants must generally elect from the following retirement options:
•
A single lump-sum payment upon retirement (unusual, unless benefit is very small);
•
A monthly benefit in the form of a single life annuity payment (based actuarially on
participant’s life and terminable upon his death); or
•
A monthly benefit in the form of a ‘joint and survivor annuity’ payment that is paid
until the death of the last survivor as between the participant and her spouse or former
spouse [AP] (and / or in some cases, as between the participant and some individual other
than her spouse or former spouse).
Family law attorneys epidemically fail to explicitly address either or both the pre- and postretirement surviving spouse coverage in the MSA/GJ. Surviving spouse benefits easily present the
most complex area of QDRO practice. Under DBPs, the surviving spouse benefit is greatly
impacted by whether the participant dies before or after retirement. In your MSA/GJ, at least
address the following: (1) whether the AP will be treated as surviving spouse with respect to some
or all of the pre-retirement survivor benefit if the participant dies before the QDRO transfer is
complete; (2) whether the AP will be treated as surviving spouse with respect to some or all of the
pre-retirement survivor benefit if the participant dies after the QDRO is entered but before either
party begins receiving benefits under the plan (that time frame can be very long depending upon
the participant’s proximity to retirement age/eligibility); and (3) if the Plan will not allow a separate
interest award, whether/ to what extent to require the participant to elect a particular form of
benefit under which the AP will continue to receive a benefit if the participant predeceases the AP
after retirement
If it is proper to require a participant to elect a joint and survivor annuity, then what form
of survivor benefit will be required? Should the survivor benefit equal 50% of the participant’s
lifetime benefit? 100%? Or some other portion? If a survivor benefit is required, what is the
resulting % or dollar amount reduction in the monthly benefit? What joint and survivor options
are even available under the particular plan? Each plan varies in terms of available options. Ask
the Plan Administrator to send you a Summary Plan Description (SPD) and read it (or skim it ‘til
you find what you are looking for). A smaller reduction in the monthly benefit payment upon the
participant’s death (eg., the amount available for payment to the surviving spouse or former
spouse), or no reduction at all, results in a greater reduction in the overall monthly benefit that will
be paid during the parties’ joint lives. Appendix 7 illustrates this phenomenon.
QDROphenia – Page 17

PRACTICE TIP: If you are seeking to require the participant to elect a joint and survivor benefit,
then be clear about which form of survivor benefit he must elect, and state that the AP award will
be a shared interest award. As demonstrated in the above table, there is a cost (reduction in
monthly benefit) to electing a joint and survivor benefit and parties may want to consider how or
whether to allocate that cost.
3. TYPE OF AWARD: SEPARATE vs. SHARED INTEREST

Separate interest awards are simplest and they advance the public policy goal of disentangling
the parties, financially and otherwise. Separate interest awards also free the participant up to elect
the form of benefit of his/her choosing. Most, but not all DBPs allow separate interest awards to
APs under a QDRO. Under separate interest awards, participant’s post-retirement death will not
affect APs benefit and therefore participant need not be required to elect a joint and survivor
benefit and designate AP as surviving spouse in order to protect the AP benefit. Also, AP can
begin receiving a separate benefit before participant elects to receive participant’s benefit (but not
sooner than participant’s earliest retirement eligibility date under the Plan).
Yet if the Plan does not allow an assignment of a separate interest to the AP, then it is
generally crucial that the participant be required to elect a joint and survivor benefit and designate
the AP as the surviving spouse for the appropriate portion of the post-retirement survivor benefit.
Recognition that the survivorship benefit has a present value all-its-own further complicates the
analysis about ‘what’s a “just and proper” apportionment of the benefit.
Attorneys should determine in advance whether the benefit can or will be paid as a
separate interest and, if not, then alternatively (a) what form of benefit the participant must elect,
and (b) how the AP’s shared interest award in the post-retirement survivor benefit (often called
“Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity” or “QJSA”) should be defined in MSA/GJ. Good
compromise language would award the AP “such amount of any post-retirement survivor benefit as
is necessary to ensure that the participant’s death following commencement of benefits does not
result in the reduction of the AP’s benefit.”
A separate interest award results in a benefit that is (a) payable to the AP over the lifetime
of the AP, and (b) actuarially adjusted / calculated based upon the AP’s life. Neither the death of
the participant, nor the participant’s decision to defer retirement for whatever reason, will have any
impact on the AP’s ability to receive her separate interest when the participant becomes eligible to
retire. As long as the participant survives to his earliest retirement eligibility date, the AP can
receive her benefit at that time regardless of whether the participant retires or not.
A few words about retirement eligibility: Generally , participants who have sufficient
creditable service time under a DBP will become eligible to receive a monthly benefit at age 65-67
(sometimes age 62).
If the AP is awarded a separate interest in the DBP, then you generally only need to
determine what fraction or percentage to award the AP, and how to articulate the award (see more
on coverture fractions, below).

QDROphenia – Page 18

With a separate interest award, the AP is generally free to elect a single life annuity and
some plans allow the AP to receive a lump sum distribution at such time as the participant
becomes eligible to apply for benefits plan. Retirement ‘eligibility’ is determined by the DBP and
governing pension statutes and regulations. But if the parties bargained for (and / or the judgment
requires) a shared interest award, then the AP is not free to elect either a single life annuity or a
lump sum distribution form of benefit; instead, she will receive a designated percentage or set
dollar amount from the participant’s monthly benefit.
If the AP will receive a shared interest award from a single life annuity (this is rare), then
the award will end upon the death of either party. This could be a spousal support scenario as
opposed to a marital property award.
Under a shared interest award, the AP is not permitted to receive benefits before the
participant’s benefits actually go into pay status; but this may not matter to the AP is she is receiving
a spousal support award that will terminate or reduce upon the AP’s access to the retirement
benefit.
Under shared interest awards, the AP does not have the right to elect what form of benefit
she receives; she is stuck with the form of benefit the participant elects, whether he elects it by
choice or because the QDRO compels a certain form of benefit.
If the AP will receive a shared interest award from a joint and survivor benefit (which is
usually the case), then express the award as a percentage of the monthly benefit, a coverture
fraction, or (less commonly) a dollar amount. State what happens to the AP’s benefit if the
participant predeceases AP after retirement (after all, the realization of such a scenario is probably
why the court ordered a shared interest in a joint and survivor annuity in the first place). The
issues here are: (a) what portion of the monthly benefit will the AP receive during the participant’s
and the AP’s joint lives? and, (b) what portion of the post-retirement monthly survivor benefit will
the AP receive following the participant’s death? The AP can receive all or some lesser portion of
that benefit.
If this is a long-term marriage and / or other equitable factors exist, it may be just and
proper to give the AP 100% of the post-retirement survivor benefit; if it is a short-term marriage or
retirement eligibility is far in the future, then perhaps the AP (if she survives participant) should
share the post-retirement survivor benefit with the participant’s new spouse (if any). If the latter,
then the apportionment formula generally relates to the percentage or coverture fraction that
serves as the basis for determining the AP’s initial award.
If the participant is already receiving retirement benefits under the plan, then the AP award
must generally be in the form of a shared interest. Under most DBPs, the participant’s election of
a joint and survivor benefit upon retirement is irrevocable, even upon divorce and regardless of
whether the GJ or QDRO provides otherwise. Shared interest award payments under a QDRO in
the post-retirement setting are essentially “check splitters.” The form and the amount of the
participant’s benefit has already been determined and is being paid-out, and all the parties or the
court can do in most circumstances is to “split the check” by paying a portion of each monthly
payment to the AP.

QDROphenia – Page 19

4. DETERMINING & ARTICULATING AP’S PORTION OF BENEFIT
The AP award needs to be defined in the MSA/GJ; if it is not, then there will be trouble.
A coverture-based formula is the most common approach for determining the marital portion of a
DBP. The amount of the benefit that is ultimately distributed to the AP depends on how we
determine the amount of the benefit that accrued during the marriage.
The two most common ways to determine the marital portion are both ‘coverture-based’
formulae. They are: (1) an immediate offset fraction that divides the benefit at the time of divorce
(aka ‘frozen coverture’ or ‘accrued coverture’) and (2) the deferred interest fraction that divides the
benefit at the time it goes to pay status (aka ‘true coverture’ or prospective coverture’). The true
coverture method generally favors the AP. The frozen coverture generally favors the participant.
Because of this important distinction, simply saying that the AP gets “50% of the marital portion of
the participant’s retirement benefit” is insufficient and will probably necessitate post-dissolution
negotiations or further litigation. Frozen vs. true coverture formulae are distinguishable by the
denominator of the coverture fraction and the benefit being divided. In either event, to achieve an
arguably equitable division, the denominator must coincide with (match) the benefit by which the
fraction is multiplied (with reference to the determination date or event tied to the benefit accrual).
The summary below is derived from an illustration prepared by Oregon attorney Lawrence
Gorin and depicts the difference between the ‘immediate offset’ (aka ‘frozen coverture’) fraction
and the ‘deferred interest’ (aka ‘true coverture’) fraction method of dividing the DBP:

*****************************
In deciding which brand of coverture fraction to use, the issue is whether participant's
service after the date of divorce should be a factor in calculating the AP’s benefit. The AP will want
to capture post-dissolution benefit accrual on her share. If, as of the date of divorce, the entire
pension benefit was accrued during the marriage and the pension won’t be payable until some
future date, then failure to use the true coverture fraction will freeze the AP’s benefit at the amount
it was estimated to be as if the date of divorce. If the asset was a DCP benefit, the AP award would
presumptively accrue earnings through the time of total distribution. Moreover, a DBP benefit is
based on the plan formula in effect on the date of retirement, not the date of divorce.
5. OWENS v. OWENS-KOENIG, 195 Or App 734
(2004) http://www.publications.ojd
This case lends further support to the proposition that Oregon prefers the 'true coverture'
over the 'frozen coverture' when dividing DBPs. The Court noted that “the 'coverture' or 'time rule'
is typically used to calculate the 'marital portion' of benefits under a defined benefit retirement
plan. The marital portion is determined by multiplying the benefit to be divided by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the years (or months) of service during which the couple were married and
the denominator [of which] is the total years (or months) of employment" – presumably at the time
of retirement as opposed to the time of the divorce. Citing Kiser and Kiser, 176 Or App 627, 632

(2013) http://law.justia.com/cases/oregon/court-of-appeals/2013/a150941.html
The holding in Tough is fairly narrow, but quite useful when determining just how much a
QDRO may deviate from the Judgment language. Simply, whether or not the division in the
Judgment tracks the division methodology preferred by Oregon courts, unambiguous language in
the Judgment dictates the rights and interests of the parties with respect to the retirement plan
benefits at issue…and the QDRO may not deviate from or otherwise modify those rights and
interests. Tough does not tell us what should happen if the Judgment language is ambiguous, or if
an important issue is simply not addressed (but see Kiser v. Kiser, below).
7. ANCILLARY BENEFITS.
The MSA/GJ needs to address ancillary benefits and should generally provide that the AP
will receive a pro rata/proportionate share (referring to the coverture formula used to divide the
normal retirement benefit) of any early retirement supplement, early retirement subsidy, 13thmonth payments, and cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) paid by the Plan on behalf of the
participant. COLAs and other ancillary benefits are integral to the DBP and if the MSA/GJ or
DRO fails to assign the AP one-half of the marital portion of such benefits, then the AP has not
received her equitable share of those benefits.
If a participant challenges the award of COLAs, or any other ancillary benefit, then
determine whether and to what extent the Plan actually provides for them and, if so, how
commonly they are paid out. If it’s a government Plan the COLAs are likely a major feature of the
Plan and the AP should wage the battle for her pro rata share. If the Plan provides for early
retirement subsidies and/or supplemental retirement benefits, then the AP needs to insist on a pro
rata award thereof. Early retirement subsidies refer to ‘golden handshake’ situations. Failure to
provide for the AP’s interest in ancillary benefits can result in substantial financial loss to an AP
and huge corresponding windfalls to a participant.
8. DEATH OF PARTICIPANT, ALTERNATE PAYEE
The rights of a spouse or former spouse to pre-retirement and post-retirement survivor
benefits are an integral component of the defined benefit and the MSA/GJ must address the AP’s
right (or lack thereof) to such benefits.
i.

Pre-retirement period:

If AP dies before benefits commence to either party, will the AP’s interest revert to
participant, or will AP be permitted to designate a remainder beneficiary (if permitted
under the plan)?
Some DBPs do not permit an AP to designate a beneficiary for their assigned award.
When a contingent AP award is authorized, the contingent AP must generally be the
children of the marriage, and often must be joint children under the age of 18 years.

QDROphenia – Page 22

If AP dies before commencement of benefits under the DBP and there’s no contingent
AP, more often than not AP’s award reverts to Participant. Some Cash Balance Plans in
particular allow the AP’s benefit to be paid to the AP’s estate or designated beneficiary.
If the participant dies before benefits commence to either party, the AP generally should
be entitled to receive some or all of any qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity (QPRSA)
benefit. The QPRSA benefit usually equals 50% of the single life annuity that would have
been paid to the participant, had the participant retired at that time rather than died.
Under the overwhelming majority of DBPs, the AP will receive no benefit if the participant
dies before payments begin, unless the AP has been specifically designated as the surviving
spouse for purposes of the QPRSA. You may want to propose language providing that the
AP shall receive “that portion of the QPRSA necessary to ensure that the AP benefit is not
reduced as a result of the participant’s death prior to the commencement of benefits.”
If the AP award is a separate interest award, most plans will allow the separate interest to be
maintained regardless of the participant’s survival. In true coverture arrangements, the
DRO/QDRO will need to provide for QPRSA coverage during the pre-retirement phase,
to protect AP's assigned interest until AP’s benefits commence under the plan. This
should not be necessary, however, if a frozen coverture arrangement is ordered.
If the AP is awarded a shared interest, then QPRSA coverage is necessary to protect the
AP's right to receive her benefit if participant dies prior to commencement of her benefits.
Most plans provide 50% QPRSA benefit that is assignable to the former spouse. 50% is
the base but frequently it is appropriate to base the AP’s QPRSA award on the AP's
awarded share of the retirement benefit. If the AP’s QPRSA award is to be based on the
proportion of her awarded share of the retirement benefit, then be careful how you
articulate the award of the QPRSA benefit. Keep in mind that the QPRSA award reflects
50% of the participant’s retirement benefit, so you may want to award the AP either 100%
of the QPRSA, or a fraction of the QPRSA equal to the coverture fraction. Note that
sometimes the parties want the AP to receive the same percentage of the QPRSA benefit as
of the annuity benefit; in that case, if participant dies, AP will receive only one-half of the
amount that AP would have received had the participant retired rather than died.
ii.

Post-retirement period:

Under a separate interest award, this is generally not an issue since the death of participant
subsequent to commencement of AP’s benefits will have no impact on AP’s benefit and
the form of benefit elected by AP will dictate what happens to her benefit after she dies.
If, however, the AP is receiving her benefit under a shared interest award, then you will
want to secure a survivor benefit (qualified joint and survivor annuity – QJSA discussed
above) to protect that award in case the participant predeceases the AP.
If the participant is already retired at the time of divorce and has elected a QJSA that
election is, most of the time, irrevocable, regardless of what the QDRO says. Some public
plans allow a participant to convert a joint & survivor benefit to a single life annuity (with
Oregon PERS Tier One/Two, a member who selected Option 2A or 3A can ‘pop-up’ to
Option 1 [single life annuity] unless the DRO prohibits). Conversion to single-life annuity
would result in an increase in participant’s benefits and perhaps the parties have some
reason to want a greater monthly payment so that more income is available for spousal
support purposes.

QDROphenia – Page 23

PRACTICE TIP: In post-retirement situations you must consider how to handle post-divorce,
ongoing payments pending plan approval and implementation of the DRO/QDRO.
Unfortunately, it’s not unusual for an AP to wait 12 or more months before they see the first
payment from the Plan. You must decide whether and how AP will get their share of the benefit
during this period—which usually requires accounting for the tax burden on participant. Address
this issue in the MSA/GJ so that you and your client don’t have to wait for the QDRO to be
prepared, filed and administered before the issue is fully addressed.
D. CASH BALANCE PLANS (CBPs)
One type of DBP requires special discussion. CBPs are DBPs in which the benefit
amount payable at retirement is calculated in a manner that looks like an account-based plan
benefit. CBPs have become increasingly popular with some larger employers in recent years. The
participant’s benefit in a CBP is usually expressed in statements as a “cash balance” – that is, they
look a lot like DCP statements because they show a precise dollar amount in an “account” for a
particular employee. They also usually provide for “interest” accruals on the stated benefit, and
include fixed, additional annual contributions. Many divorce practitioners treat CBPs just like
DCPs for settlement purposes, only to find that CBPs can’t be divided as DCPs. Likewise, many
CBP participants don’t realize that their CBP benefits aren’t like those in a traditional 401(k) Plan.
Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that, like most DBPs, most CBPs
provide for benefit payments only after participant reaches his earliest retirement age and only in
the form of an annuity. An award of some portion or dollar amount from the employee ‘account’
(credited each year with some form of ‘pay credit’) may not result in the desired division, and may
leave numerous important items unaddressed.
When confronted with a CBP benefit, be sure to review the Plan SPD thoroughly, as you’ll
likely find some surprises that should then affect the way you divide the benefit. For more
information on CBPs, see the U.S. Dept. of Labor’s FAQs about CBPs at:
http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq_consumer_cashbalanceplans.html
See Appendix 6 for a Condensed list of Considerations in drafting CBP QDROs.
E. NON-DIVISIBLE, NON-QUALIFIED PLANS
Some retirement benefits are simply not divisible, yet courts may consider their value in
determining a just and proper division of marital property. Investigate this issue early in the
discovery phase of your case, to determine whether a party has an interest in such a plan and, if so,
the plan’s options and limitations for dividing benefits in the divorce context. Non-divisible plans
frequently show up in the context of highly compensated employees, and such plans allow
employers to provide employees with retirement benefits that exceed the limitations under ERISA
and the tax Code. Here is a summary from Morgan Stanley about this type of plan, which they
refer
to
as
a
Nonqualified
Deferred
Compensation
Plan: http://www.morganstanleyfa.com/public/facilityfiles/sb090226100041/9c815787-cbbc-440d9957-9118b7e6e8e2.pdf

QDROphenia – Page 24

Non-qualified plans usually have key terms in their names such as:
SERP
Non-qualified Deferred Compensation
Phantom Stock
Excess Benefit
409(a)
Management Incentive
Such plans are not ‘qualified’ and often won’t accept a QDRO/DRO or permit assignment
of benefits. The divorce attorney must determine whether one of these plans can be divided
before settlement negotiations are completed or the case is tried. A nightmare situation erupts
when the parties discover, sometimes many years after the GJ that a retirement interest that they
agreed to divide is indivisible or un-assignable. If you discover that a nonqualified plan is nondivisible, then a recital should be made in the MSA or GJ that no portion of the benefit can be
assigned to the non-participant spouse.
If the non-divisible plan is the only major asset, then you could have the participant spouse
secure an insurance policy for the non-participant spouse’s benefit or increase spousal support
payments (presently or in the future, upon retirement). Any solution will have some drawbacks,
but creative, alternative approaches may be less complicated and more appealing than obligating
the participant to make payments to the other spouse every time he receives payments from the
plan in the future. Possible approaches include: awarding the non-employee spouse an immediate
offset using an asset of comparable value, if one exists and value of the nonqualified plan can be
determined; deferred payment arrangement/mechanism pain-stakingly set forth under an
MSA/court order that requires participant spouse to send non-participant spouse a portion of each
future payment he/she receives; this is the least desirable approach because it fails to disentangle
the parties, relies on long-term, mutual cooperation, and good faith adherence to notification
duties, etc.
The issue of surviving spouse benefits adds additional complications. Under many
circumstances, it is reasonable for the MSA / GJ to require that the non-employee spouse be
named as the sole surviving spouse and beneficiary of the non-divisible plan. If such an option is
not available under the plan, or is not equitable for whatever reason, the non-employee spouse
could pursue an arrangement whereby the employee spouse designates the non-employee spouse
as beneficiary for some or all of the death benefit under a life insurance policy or other, qualified
retirement plan.
If you absolutely must conclude the case before you can determine whether the nonqualified plan benefit can be divided by DRO, then you will either want the court to expressly
reserve jurisdiction to enter a corrected judgment or include a provision in the MSA/GJ allowing
for an alternate award such as “In the event that it is determined that Husband’s ABC Nonqualified Management Incentive Plan cannot be divided by DRO or any other method of division
and assignment acceptable under the Plan, then in lieu of the interest awarded to Wife under the
terms of this section, Wife shall receive” and then set forth the alternative (perhaps some dollar
amount as of a specified date from Husband’s DCP (adjusted, of course, for interest and earnings
from that date forward).

PART 4: GOVERNMENTAL & OTHER NON-ERISA PLANS.
Many government retirement plans exist, and they are generally ‘largely exempt’ from
ERISA and IRC 414(p). This means that they are not subject to QDRO rules and terms, but are
instead subject to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, and state and other regulatory
law. The discussion that follows treats only the main Federal and Oregon retirement plans. The
following concepts apply in some other government retirement plans that you may encounter, but
you must investigate each plan individually and should consult a DRO attorney to assist you.

PRACTICE TIP: Many typical QDRO terms and provisions are frequently unacceptable to these
Plans. Craft your language carefully.
A. FEDERAL RETIREMENT PLANS (Non-Military Federal Employees).
The Federal government’s three main retirement plans are: Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) (a
DCP); Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS); and Civil Service Retirement System
(CSRS). FERS & CSRS are DBPs with associated contribution accounts. Current or former
federal employees (FE) general participate in TSP and in one of the DBPs.
1. FERS & CSRS:
The United States Office of Personnel Management (‘OPM’) administers FERS and CSRS
and will accept a Court Order Acceptable for Processing (‘COAP’) to divide the plan benefits.
Before you begin negotiations concerning FERS or CSRS, review the applicable definitions in the
CFR. They are printed for you at Appendix 8.
The FE’s interest in these plans is assignable to a spouse or former spouse (‘FS’) under a
COAP (not “QDRO”). The procedure for assigning FERS or CSRS benefits to a FS is heavily
regulated under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. Specialized terminology is necessary to
express the FS’s award, and a basic understanding of the plans’ characteristics is necessary to
protect your client’s interests, regardless of whether you represent the FE or the FS. OPM has
published useful guidelines and summaries about FERS & CSRS:
http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR986/MR986.appa.pdf
A court order may affect any (or all) of three types of retirement benefits paid by OPM
under FERS & CSRS: the employee annuity, refunds of employee contributions, and survivor
annuities. The benefits themselves are related and provisions made for one may affect
another. For example, awarding a former spouse survivor annuity or permitting a refund of
employee contributions can result in a reduction to the employee annuity. Federal regulations
govern each type of benefit and can be found at:
http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?rgn=div5&node=5:2.0.1.1.18

PRACTICE TIP: Attorneys are strongly advised to familiarize themselves with governing
regulations before attempting to negotiate FERS & CSRS benefits.

context, see the following OPM publications:

•
Court-ordered Benefits for Former Spouses
https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/pamphlets/ri84-1.pdf
CSRS & SSI: If the FE participates in CSRS and was hired before 1984, the governmental
employer does not contribute to Social Security on FE’s behalf. The issues here are (a) the CSRS
member’s retirement benefits under CSRS won’t be supplemented by SSI; (b) the CSRS
member’s benefit is beefed-up in lieu of access to SSI; (c) had the member worked in the private
sector, only his pension, and not SSI, would be subject to division; (d) have both spouses worked
during the marriage?; (e) does AP have her own SSI benefits? And if not, will she not receive a
(former) spouse’s share of the CSRS member’s SSI because the member isn’t getting any?
If, however, the FE was hired after 1983, then he/she participates in FERS; some FE’s
hired before 1983 transferred to FERS from CSRS. FERS consists of 3 components: the Basic
Plan, TSP and Social Security.
Three Primary Components of FERS and CSRS:
(1) THE ANNUITY: A Court Order Acceptable for Processing (COAP) can
divide a federal employee’s (FE’s) monthly pension benefit and pay a portion to the
employee’s former spouse (FS) if and when the benefit is payable to FE. FS must wait
until FE retires before FS can receive FS’s portion of FE’s retirement benefit, as there
is no option for the FS to receive benefits at FE’s earliest retirement eligibility date if FE
does not commence retirement benefits at that time. The award cannot be a separate
interest award and therefore FS cannot elect to receive FS’s benefit in any form. FS’s
award is based entirely upon FE’s life and will continue only during FE’s life unless FE
elects (or is ordered) to elect a former spouse survivor annuity (‘FSSA’) for the benefit
of FS. Assignment of benefits to FS is treated more like a garnishment than a separate
property award, and the award can be expressed as a dollar, percentage or formulaic
amount of FE’s annuity.
If FS wants a pro rata share of COLAs, then the MSA/GJ should specify this in order
to preserve FS’s right to receive them under the COAP. If FS award is expressed as a
dollar figure, then FS will not receive COLAs unless the COAP expressly provides for an
award of COLAs. If FS award is expressed as a percentage of FE’s benefit, or by use of a
formula, then FS’s award will be automatically adjusted on a pro rata basis when COLAs
are made. Percentage and formulaic assignments are more common than dollar amounts.
Like with other DBPs, when drafting MSA/GJ provisions that concern FERS/CSRS,
you need to consider the coverture language and principles discussed in the general section
on DBPs, above. Do you want to exclude or include benefits attributable to service earned
before and after the marriage? If you award ‘50% as of the date of divorce’, then OPM will
automatically exclude any benefits based on service earned after marriage, including those

QDROphenia – Page 27

attributable to salary increases after the date of divorce. This approach does not provide
any inflationary protection for the AP. Spell out the numerator and denominator.
Use of the term ‘gross benefit’ or ‘gross annuity’ will be interpreted as meaning the FE’s
self-only annuity after being reduced for the cost of any FSSA (survivor benefit), and will
result in both parties sharing in the cost to insure the FSSA on a proportionate basis. The
COAP can also require the FS to bear the full cost of securing the FSSA (the amount of
the difference between the FE’s self-only annuity and the FE’s gross annuity). So whatever
percentage or dollar award you express, be clear as to whether it is to be assessed against
the FE’s gross benefit or to the FE’s self-only annuity.
(2) REFUNDS OF EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS. FE has the right to withdraw
his contributions account to his pension prior to retirement. Such a refund is only of
employee contributions and not the value of the DBP plan and not the full value of the
retirement annuity. Employee contributions are generally recovered in the first 3-4 years
following retirement. If the employee contributions account is $50,000, then the present
value of the annuity is probably closer to $200,000. Although the FE has the right to cash
out the contributions account, under normal circumstances he would not wish to do so
because a total cash out would eliminate the right to the more valuable annuity benefit.
The MSA/GJ needs to address the ‘refund of employee contribution account’
issue. Generally the AP will want to prohibit refunds of employee contributions except
with express consent of the AP. In cases where a refund is permitted, the order should
provide that FS will receive a pro rata share of such refund. Just be sure that FS
understands that in such a scenario the FS would get only her share of the refund, but
nothing else, since a total cash-out would eliminate any annuity payment.
In sum, taking away the FE’s right to refunds locks her in to the annuity benefit
scenario and thus preserves the FS’s right to receive his share of such benefit and the
survivor benefit if awarded.
(3) SURVIVORSHIP.
Pre-retirement ‘Basic Employee Death Benefit’. If FE dies with at least 18 months
of creditable service, then the Basic Employee Death Benefit (or a portion thereof) may be
payable to the FS if a COAP provides for such an award, the FS was married to the FE for
a total of at least 9 months, and the FS did not remarry before reaching the age of 55 years.
Former Federal Employee & ‘Former Spouse Survivor Annuity (FSSA).’ Provided
that the right is properly secured under a COAP that is on file with OPM, the FS who
survives the former FE can receive a FSSA or a portion thereof. The FS must have been
married to FE for at least 9 months and must not have remarried before reaching the age
of 55 years (unless she was married to the FE for 30 or more years). If the FS remarried
prior to age 55, then she would not be entitled to receive FSSA coverage or payments.
Under the FSSA, CSRS pays up to 50% of the total pension benefit. If concerns exist
about the FS’s continuation of / access to Federal healthcare benefits, then talk with a DRO
attorney; in order to preserve the FS’s right to continue access to Federal Employee
Healthcare Benefits (at her own cost and per her election), the COAP would need to
assign the FS something, even $1, from the surviving spouse annuity.

QDROphenia – Page 28

As explained above, there is a cost associated with securing FSSA coverage under CSRS
or FERS. The cost varies and it isn’t cheap. Parties will want to explore whether they want
to have this coverage, and if so, who is responsible to pay; if the order does not say who is
responsible to pay for it, it will be shared equally between the parties.
How much will the monthly annuity be reduced as a result of providing joint and
survivor coverage? If the FE elects (or the COAP requires) an insurable interest survivor
annuity for FS equal to 55% of participant’s reduced annuity, then the amount of reduction
in participant’s self-only annuity will depend upon the difference between participant’s age
and the age of AP/survivor annuitant, as described in the following table:
Age of AP in relation to age of Participant
Older, same age, or less than 5-years younger
5 but less than 10 yrs younger
10 but less than 15 yrs younger
15 but less than 20 yrs younger
20 but less than 25 yrs younger
25 but less than 30 yrs younger
30 or more yrs younger

Reduction in Selfonly Annuity
10%
15%
20
25%
30%
35%
40%

A ‘COAP’ that assigns FSSA coverage must be enforced by OPM. For more information
on Former Spouse Survivor Benefits under CSRS & FERS, see:

Handbook for Attorneys on Court-ordered Retirement Benefits (CSRS & FERS)

OPM’s Former Spouse Survivor Benefits Chapter 74
https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/c074.pdf
DISPOSITION OF FS’s INTEREST UPON DEATH OF FS. Annuity payments that are
assigned to a FS under a COAP are payable during the FE’s and FS’s joint lifetime. If the FS
predeceases the FE, then if the COAP is silent on the issue, the FS’s assigned interest will revert to
the FE. The COAP can also expressly state that the assigned benefit reverts to the FE in the event
that the FS predeceases the FE. Alternatively, the COAP can provide that if the FS predeceases
the FE either before or after the benefit goes into pay status, then FS’s share can be paid to the
parties’ joint children, or to the FS’s estate. Another option under FERS & CSRS is to direct that
the FS’s share be paid to the clerk of the court.

PRACTICE TIP: Among family law and DRO practitioners, OPM has a reputation for being
inaccessible, unresponsive and generally difficult to communicate with. If you have a case in which
you must communicate with OPM, bear in mind that they are slow and difficult and pace yourself
/ plan accordingly. DRO attorneys have experience dealing with OPM and time-saving strategies
that should save your client time and money.

The Case of Kiser and Kiser: Kiser and Kiser, 176 Or App 627, 32 P3d 244 (2001). The
Kisers ended their 30-year marriage and stipulated at trial that husband's federal retirement
benefits would be equally divided. Husband was a non-retired member under CSRS & TSP and
planned to work another 10-11 years for the federal government. The GJ awarded wife “50% of
husband's CSRS benefits and TSP benefits as of the date of entry of this decree” and the court
retained jurisdiction to implement division of “retirement accounts” in accordance with applicable
federal law and regulations. At the time of appeal, it appeared that neither party had prepared or
filed the necessary domestic relations orders.
Wife argued on appeal that the GJ’s retirement benefit provision was “defective” in 4
respects and sought clarification and instructions regarding division of such benefits. She argued:
(1) The GJ failed to specify (a) when her 50% of the TSP could be distributed and (b)
whether her share would include earnings that accrued on her portion between the date of divorce
and of distribution. The Court compared the TSP benefit to a 401(k) Plan benefit and expressly
found that the GJ language “mean[t]” wife was entitled to 50% of the total account balance
accumulated under the plan as of date of dissolution, interest on her portion from the valuation
date/date of divorce, payment as soon as administratively feasible under the plan, and that this was
the “appropriate method of dividing defined contribution retirement plans.” Kiser, 32 P3d at 246.
(2) The GJ failed to specify how wife's CSRS interest would be calculated and distributed.
The Court of Appeals agreed that the GJ's award of '50% of husband's CSRS benefits as of the date
of divorce' did not adequately explain how the benefit was to be calculated or distributed, and it
held that the proper method of dividing the defined benefit was to “determine the actuarial present

value [which] is by definition that amount of money presently needed to purchase an annuity that
would pay a particular monthly amount for the life expectancy of the retired employee. To
calculate the present value of this kind of marital asset * * * the 'time rule' is used. That rule
requires multiplying the present value by a fraction, the numerator of which is the years or months
of service during which the spouses lived together as a marital unit [and] the denominator of which
is the total years of service required to receive the retirement benefit.” Wife argued that an award
to her of a portion of the actuarial present value of the benefit was not feasible or appropriate in
the case because: (a) she could receive a portion of husband's monthly CSRS benefit when it
moves into pay status, thereby providing her with a steady income source through her retirement;
(b) there was no evidence in the record of the Plan's actuarial, present value; and, (c) the trial court
made no attempt to offset the value of the CSRS benefit against other marital property. Husband
argued that (a) wife should receive 50% of the monthly benefit he would have received at the date
of divorce (frozen coverture) and (b) inequity would result if wife's interest was calculated on the
basis of his benefit-at-retirement, since that amount would be based in-part upon potential postdivorce salary increases. The Court determined that husband’s reasoning “ignored the straight-line
appreciation of benefits under a defined benefit plan” noting that it had “repeatedly emphasized
that when retirement benefits have not matured and are thus not presently liquid, it is equitable to
look to the value of the benefit at retirement because it is not proper to assume, for purposes of
determining the “value of these rights, that husband would immediately leave public service and *
* * ignore the vested pension benefits.”

QDROphenia – Page 30

(3) The “trial court erred” in failing to include a requirement that husband elect a former
spouse survivor annuity that would insure that wife continue receiving CSRS benefits for her
lifetime, in the event that husband predeceased her. Husband did not contest the equity of the
award, but argued that wife, not husband, should pay for that benefit since he would “never receive
any of its benefits.” Yet the Court acknowledged wife's 30-year contributions as wife, mother and
homemaker, during which time the benefits that would be subject to the survivor annuity had
accrued, and concluded that she was entitled to the maximum CSRS former spouse survivor
benefit. The Court required the parties to equally divide the cost to insure the survivor benefit.
(4) The “trial court erred” in failing to require that “the parties jointly purchase” husband's
military credits. Husband could draw a greater benefit at retirement by purchasing credits for the 3
years & 11 months that he served in the military during the early years of the marriage. The Court
of Appeals equated the option to purchase such credits to a marital asset despite the fact that they
had not yet been purchased, and stated that it was within the Court's equitable powers to order
husband to exercise the buy-back option as to the military service credits that he had earned during
the marriage, despite the fact that the GJ did not contain such order. The Court noted that the
record contained a stipulation that the parties would split the cost of the military credit buy-back.
2.

THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN (TSP):

TSP is a defined contribution plan (DCP) for Federal employees. It closely resembles a
401(k) Plan and is relatively easy to ‘divide’. There are two types: civilian and military. If a party
has both, then you may need two DROs. For most civilian FEs hired after 1983, TSP is one of a
3-part retirement system that also includes Social Security retirement income and FERS basic
annuity. For civilian FEs hired before 1984 who did not switch to FERS, the TSP supplements the
FE’s CSRS annuity. Special rules exist regarding Uniformed Services Accounts under TSP. For
an excellent summary of TSP, visit the Summary of the Thrift Savings Plan, published by the
Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board at: https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspbk08.pdf
A DRO concerning TSP can be issued at any stage of divorce, annulment or legal
separation. TSP calls such DROs “retirement benefits court order” but we will stick to DRO.
There are four main issues that the MSA/GJ needs to address in the TSP context; they are:
a. Identify the asset by precise name: “Thrift Savings Plan” (TSP).
b. State that FS is entitled to “[specific dollar amount or fraction or percentage]
from FE’s TSP account(s) as of [specified past or current date (valuation date)].”
c. State the valuation date expressly.
d. State whether earnings will be paid on the amount of the FS’s entitlement from
the valuation date through the time that payment is made to the FS. Generally,
the answer is yes, but the MSA/GJ must be clear on this in order to bind the
parties, guide the DRO attorney, and prevent post-MSA/GJ disputes.
If there are any TSP loan balances outstanding, then you need to address that somehow in
the MSA/GJ. When a percentage is awarded and a loan balance exists and the court order is silent
about loan treatment (inclusion vs exclusion), then TSP will determine the FS’s share based upon
the loan inclusion method (discussed above in the section devoted to DCPs). The FS cannot
maintain her funds within TSP. TSP basically transfers the FS’s interest 30 days after it approves

QDROphenia – Page 31

the court order. The FS has only 60 days in which to apply for a rollover; if the FS does not so
apply, then TSP will issue her a check. They waste no time.
Only a court order can freeze a TSP member’s account during divorce proceedings; if you
are concerned that the FE will withdraw, then obtain a court order directed at TSP and prohibiting
the FE from obtaining a TSP loan or withdrawal until further court order. Present a court certified
copy of the ‘freeze’ order to TSP’s legal processing unit; this will prevent further loans and
withdrawals but will not prevent the FE from engaging in other TSP account activity, such as
investment decisions and payments on existing loans.
The TSP member’s spouse and his/her attorney may obtain account balance and TSP
transaction history by submitting a written request that includes: the name and relationship of the
requesting party to the FE; the FE’s name and TSP account number (or SSN); a description of the
information needed; and the purpose for which the information is being requested. Requests for
TSP account information must be in writing and directed at:
TSP Legal Processing Unit
Regular mail: PO Box 4570, Fairfax, VA 22038
Overnight mail: 12210 Fairfax Town Center, Unit 906, Fairfax, VA 22033

State and local government retirement systems are specifically exempt from ERISA. Some
state and local government plan are non-divisible. See section E of Part 3, above at p. 25, for
general principles regarding non-divisible plans.
1. DIVISIBLE PLANS, GENERALLY
Oregon state and local government agencies/employers participate in various retirement
plans, including DCPs, DBPs, and hybrid plans. The state or government employee’s
participation is any given plan is based on the capacity in which the employee works and his/her
elections in the employment benefit selection process. Also relevant is when the employee began
working for the government employer because, over time, the available selection of retirement
plans has changed; for example, Oregon PERS Tier One/Tier Two no longer accepts new
members.
State and local government employees generally participate in non-ERISA DCPs (including
but certainly not limited to 403(b) and 457(b) plans). Many TIAA CREF contracts contain these
types of plans and thus fall into this category. Federal law has been interpreted to allow division by
‘QDRO’ of Section 403(b) and 457(b) plans for employees of certain tax-exempt organizations and
for governmental and certain non-governmental employers in the U.S. These divisible,
government DCPs closely resemble 401(k) plans and your approach to these plans should closely
mirror your approach to 401(k) Plans.

QDROphenia – Page 32

403(b) plans: These are ‘tax-sheltered annuity’ retirement plans for certain public school
employees, certain ministers, and employees of certain IRC Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt
organizations. 403(b) plans allow employees to contribute some of their salary to
the 403(b) plan.
457(b) plans: These are ‘deferred compensation plans’ established by state or local
government or tax exempt organizations under IRC 501(c). Participants are employees of
such entities and they and/or the employer contribute, through salary reductions, up to the
IRC 401(g) limit ($18,000 in 2015). Contributions and earnings on contributions are taxdeferred and may include Roth contributions.
2. OREGON PERS
Oregon state employees generally participate in the Oregon Public Employees Retirement
System (‘PERS’). PERS accepts Domestic Relations Orders that meet the requirements of ORS
Chapters 238 and 238A and the correlating rules and regulations under the Oregon Administrative
Rules chapter 459: http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/rules/oars_400/oar_459/459_tofc.html
Approximately 95% of all public employees in Oregon participate in PERS. There are nearly
1,000 PERS employers, including: state agencies; universities and community colleges; all school
districts; and. most city, county and local government agencies.
Generally speaking, PERS members participate in one of two plan ‘packages’:
1. OPSRP (Pension Program + Individual Account Program [IAP]); or,
2. PERS Tier One / Tier Two + IAP
For an excellent summary comparing PERS’ Tier One, Tier Two, OPSRP and IAP plans, and an
excellent summary comparing PERS Tier One/Two benefit options, see Appendix 9.
A few words about the switch from PERS Tier One/Two to OPSRP:
Beginning January 2004, already-established ‘Tier One / Tier Two’ (‘Tier’) employees retained
their existing Tier accounts and benefits, but as of 1/1/2004, no additional member contributions
are being made to the accounts. Instead, ongoing member contributions consisting of 6% of the
member’s salary are deposited to the Tier member’s PERS IAP account (which was newlyestablished as of late 2003/early 2004). Members’ Tier One accounts continue, however, to earn
the annual interest (8%), and Tier Two accounts continue to be credited with earnings or losses.
Effective 28 August 2003, newly-hired, PERS eligible employees do not participate in Tier One /
Tier Two, but instead in the OPSRP system, which consists of the defined benefit plan (OPSRP
Pension Program) and the IAP defined contribution plan (DCP).
Understanding the differences between these plans, including the available retirement options
thereunder, will help you tremendously in negotiations, trial prep and the drafting of your
MSA/GJ. To that end, here are a few critical resources to tap to get a solid, foundational
understanding of the PERS plans that we routinely encounter as Oregon family law attorneys:

(i)

PERS INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT PROGRAM (IAP)

This is a defined contribution plan available for all active Tier One/Tier Two and OPSRP
members. In 2003, the Oregon legislature created the IAP to provide an individual-based
retirement benefit for new employees hired after 28 August 2003, and for Tier One/Tier Two
member active on or after 1 January 2004.
The IAP contribution is 6% of the Member’s compensation. The IAP benefit is separate
from and in addition to the member’s interest in Tier One/Tier Two or OPSRP. IAP accounts
exist within a pooled fund that is managed by ING (nka VOYA Financial). IAP accounts are
credited with investment earnings and losses annually (during March, for the prior year), and have
no guaranteed rate of return. Members and Alternate Payees (APs) can roll over IAP funds to
traditional IRAs, eligible employer plans, 457(b) Plans, Oregon Savings Growth Plan or another
qualified plan. Members retiring from IAP can receive their account balance as a lump-sum
payment or in installments over a 5, 10, 15 or 20-year period. Members can designate a beneficiary
of their choosing to receive any remainder balance following the member’s death. DROs can
require the member to designate the AP as beneficiary for some or all of the remainder.
(1) Valuation Date. Approach PERS IAP the same as you would a 401(k) but do not
assume that you can divide the account as of the date of dissolution or ‘any old date’.
IAP division must be as of December 31st of a year prior to the date of divorce or
separation. That said, in a case in which the parties were divorced in October 2014,
PERS administered an order that provided for the account to be split as of 31
December 2014. Talk with PERS if you have questions or wish to use a future date for
division.
(2) Getting Around the Valuation Date Dilemma. The challenge with IAP splits is figuring
out how to capture a portion of the IAP account contributions (not accrued interest)
that are made after 12/31 and before the date of divorce or property settlement. The
best approach is to determine the current YTD amount of IAP contributions, up
through the date of divorce or property settlement date. You can glean this
information from the Member’s pay stubs, or have the Member log into her online
account and view and print primary documentation concerning IAP contributions.
QDROphenia – Page 34

PERS allocates earnings after the end of the calendar year and after they add that year’s
contributions. So you may look at the Member’s YTD income on his/her pay stub and
calculate 6% to determine the YTD IAP contribution. Add such contributions to the
prior year’s 12/31 account balance to yield the current account balance; then, express
the AP’s interest as a fixed dollar amount as of the end of the prior year. If the AP’s
IAP award is expressed in percentage language, then you cannot capture contributions
made between the date of divorce and 12/31 of the prior year. You can express your
percentage award as a whole number or up to two decimal points (such as 57.66%).
(3) Beneficiary Designations. Finally, your MSA/GJ should address whether the PERS
IAP Member can change his/her pre-retirement beneficiary designation if the AP was
previously named as beneficiary.
(4) AP’s Distribution Options. The AP can elect an immediate distribution, maintain an
AP IAP account, or roll the balance into an IRA, 457(b) or other qualified plan.
(ii)
PERS TIER ONE / TIER TWO This is a hybrid plan – a defined benefit plan with a
PERS Tier One / Tier Two member account component. Be very careful how you articulate the
award under the MSA/GJ, as reference to the ‘PERS member account’ or ‘PERS account’ will not
dispose of the defined benefit component. See section (5), below.
(1) Primary differences between Tier One & Tier Two. Members hired before 1996 have
Tier One, while members hired between 1/01/1996 and 8/28/2003 have Tier Two.
Members hired after 8/28/2003 have OPSRP (see below). The main differences
between Tier One and Tier Two are as follows: (a) Tier One guarantees (as of January
2014) 7.75% (formerly 8%) annual earnings for regular member accounts, while Tier
Two Tier Two accounts are credited with actual earnings or losses; (b) ‘Normal
retirement’ age under Tier One is 58 years, while under Tier Two it’s 60 years; and (c)
Early retirement reduction for Tier One at age 55 equals 76% of the age 58 normal
retirement benefit; while the early retirement reduction for Tier Two at age 55 equals
60% of the age 60 normal retirement benefit.
(2) Payment options under Tier One and Tier Two: The four web links, above, provide
excellent charts and summaries concerning the form, manner and timing of the various
Tier One/Two retirement options. They are, generally:

Option 1 (single life annuity)
•
Option 2 (joint & 100% survivor annuity w/ 15% reduction from Option 1
•
Option 3 (joint & 50% survivor annuity w/ approx. 8% reduction from Option 1
•
Option 2A or 3A – same as 2 & 3 but Member may convert to Option 1 as
provided in ORS 238.305(1) if Member’s beneficiary (a) dies or (b) is Member’s spouse
and marriage is terminated as provided by law;
•
Refund Annuity (single life w/ account balance minimum)
•
15-year certain (single life w/ 15 year minimum payments.

QDROphenia – Page 35

(3) Retired Tier One / Tier Two Member. If the Member is a retiree, there are two
unique rules (and correlating opportunities and traps) to consider:
•
If Member elected Option 2A, 3A, L2A or L3A, then Member can “pop-up” to
Option 1 upon divorce, unless the (MSA/GJ) DRO restricts Member’s right to do so. If
the DRO is silent about a pop-up, then PERS allows the pop-up at the Member’s request.
However, a pop-up would deprive the AP of the assurance of a PERS Tier benefit for life,
because under Option 1, the benefit would terminate upon the death of the Member.
•
If the retiree Member elected a joint and survivor retirement option and designated
the non-employee spouse as the survivor beneficiary, and the non-employee spouse (AP) is
awarded any interest in the member’s PERS Tier One/Two benefit, then the DRO can
award the Member the right to change his survivor annuity beneficiary. ORS
238.465(2)(d). PERS would then recalculate the benefit to reflect the life expectancy of the
Member and her new survivor beneficiary. If the DRO is silent concerning the right to
change the joint and survivor beneficiary, then PERS will not permit Member to change it.
Make it clear in your MSA/GJ.
(4) Post-retirement Survivor Annuity. The PERS survivor annuity benefit may be valued as
a separate asset in the divorce. Miller and Garren, 208 Or App 619 (2006). The other
side of the coin is that if the AP predeceases the Member, then there could be an offset
value issue. One would have to value each contingent survivor benefit separately based
on life expectancy factors. The simpler approach that would obviate the need for a
complicated valuation and analysis would be to allow each party to designate a
beneficiary for his/her share upon the death of the first spouse. In any case, upon
divorce, the survivor benefit can remain payable to the former spouse in full, or it can
be split between the former spouse and another beneficiary.
(5) Non-Retired PERS Tier One / Tier Two. One of the most common fails by family law
practitioners in this context is inserting language into the MSA/GJ providing for an
award to the non-member spouse of a dollar amount or percentage of/from the
member’s “PERS Account.” Use the word “benefit(s)” rather than ‘account.’ For
example: “Pursuant to a DRO to be prepared by a qualified professional to be retained

by [Wife], Wife shall be awarded and assigned the following-described interests in
Husband’s Oregon PERS Tier One benefits…” This is a good opening to a

description of the award. Misuse (or insufficient use) of the term ‘account’ has been
epidemic in MSA/GJs, and has failed to serve justice more times that we can count.
Despite the parties’ intentions at the time of negotiations and settlement, some parties
in the post-dissolution / pre-DRO stage have taken advantage of situations created by
unwitting drafters, wherein the term “account” was insufficiently used to describe the
AP’s award, by arguing that there was no award of the defined benefit aspects of the
plan, or of any pre-retirement survivor benefit. And some courts have ruled in favor of
the member in this context.
Upon retirement, PERS Tier One / Tier Two Members benefits are calculated under
either the ‘Full Formula’ or ‘Money Match’ method. Before you negotiate or prepare
your MSA/GJ, you should have a sense of which retirement formula the Member will
QDROphenia – Page 36

most likely receive. If you determine (generally through process of securing a
professional valuation) that Full Formula would yield the highest benefit, then a shared
interest award may best serve the AP’s interests.
Tier One members hired in the mid-1980s or earlier, tend to retire under the Money
Match formula calculation because its value tends to exceed the Full Formula
approach; in such cases, the AP could pursue a separate interest award with matching
employer dollars, or a ‘Payment Reduction or Deduction Method’ award (a shared
interest award) using percentage, monthly dollar amount or coverture fraction
(‘Married time ratio, which by PERS default employs a ‘true coverture’ method
calculation). For Tier One members hired in the mid-1980s to early 1990s, it is not as
clear which approach will yield a greater benefit. For Tier Two members, the member
is most likely to elect the Full Formula because in most cases it will yield a higher
benefit.
The options available to an AP in the pre-retirement DRO context are (1) a separate
interest award of a sum or percentage of the member’s Tier One / Tier Two account,
plus an award of employer matching dollars; or (2) compelling the member to elect a
joint and survivor annuity and awarding the AP a shared interest award (referred to by
PERS as the reduction or deduction method), which is like a garnishment of the
member’s monthly benefit and is expressed as a percentage, dollar amount or ‘married
time ratio’ (true coverture).
Your MSA/GJ must articulate whether the AP will be awarded a separate interest or a
shared interest in the member’s benefits. If a separate interest, then state the date of
division (must be December 31) and whether the award will include employer
matching funds (in nearly all instances, matching funds should be awarded). If the
member is a retiree, then a separate interest award is not available.
A separate interest award allows immediate disentanglement as to the PERS asset and
allows the member to elect whichever form of benefit she chooses, and AP to elect a
single life annuity under Option 1. Additionally, it allows AP to commence benefits
upon member’s earliest retirement eligibility date, even if member continues working.
An AP who is awarded a shared interest in a joint and survivor benefit must wait until
the member retires to receive any payment of benefits; and under this scenario, the
MSA/GJ and resulting DRO would compels the member to elect a survivorship option
for the AP and then split the payments in some manner. It is also possible, though not
common, to award the member all of the joint lifetime benefit, but award the AP (if she
survives the member) all of the survivor benefit. You can get creative here.
The shared interest / joint and survivor benefit approach may be ideal for long-term
marriages wherein the member has a shorter life expectancy than the AP; or where it is
equitable for the AP to capture a share of the member’s post-divorce service credit and
related increases in the monthly benefit. The concepts explored in the DBP section,
above, concerning coverture fractions and ‘slicing the pie’ also apply in the context of
PERS Tier One/Two and OPSRP).
QDROphenia – Page 37

The award as expressed in your MSA/GJ is the best (and if push comes to shove, may
be the only) foundation for the subsequent DRO. Without the proper language, the
AP may be short-changed to the tune of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars as a
result of the divorce lawyer’s failure to addresses any aspect of the PERS benefit
beyond the ‘member account.’ Simply using the term ‘account’ in relation to the PERS
Tier program award, fails to establish any basis for an award/assignment of the defined
benefit and employer matching dollars aspects of the PERS Tier interest. It also
neglects numerous other aspects of the Tier program benefits: If you are going to
award a separate interest, then be sure to address employer matching funds; if you are
awarding a shared interest, then state the portion of the AP’s assigned monthly benefit,
which survivor annuity option the member must elect, whether the AP will receive a
dollar amount, percentage (up to 100%) or fractional ratio of the survivor benefit
when/if paid, and whether the AP will be treated as the surviving spouse for purposes
of any pre-retirement survivor benefits.
(6) Death and Survivorship. Specify what happens to the AP award if the AP predeceases
the Member before retirement: does the award revert to the Member or does it get
paid to the AP’s designated beneficiary. If the Member dies before the AP, does her
interest go to the AP or to the Member’s designated beneficiary? Your MSA/GJ
should be clear about this and there are numerous, and complicated options, as under
all defined benefit plans.
(7) PERS Administrative Fees.
PERS imposes an administrative fee for
reviewing/administering the DRO and regardless of how the MSA/GJ or DRO provide
to allocate that fee between the parties, PERS will allocate it pro-rata – in proportion to
the award. You can say it will be divided equally if permitted by PERS, and if not then
assessed against each party in proportion to such party’s award.
(8) Who Will Prepare the Order? In your MSA/GJ, state which party will retain counsel
to prepare the DRO(s), and how the attorney fees will be handled.
(iii)

OPSRP PENSION PROGRAM

The PERS Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan (OPSRP) Pension Program is a defined
benefit plan (DBP) for eligible state employees who are hired after 8/28/2003. OPSRP Pension
Program provides a life pension and is funded by employer contributions. It is designed to provide
approximately 45% of the member’s final, average salary at retirement for general service members
with 30-year career or police/firefighter members with 25-year careers. Final average salary is
generally the average of the highest three consecutive years or 1/3 of total salary in the last 36months of employment.
Approach the OPSRP DBP using the concepts enumerated under the general DBP
section, above.

QDROphenia – Page 38

A pre-retirement death benefit is now available through OPSRP even if the Member is not
married at the time of the Member’s death. SB 370 in 2015 amended ORS Chapter 238A to
allow a Court order to protect the pre-retirement survivor annuity for former spouse if so provided
in the judgment or court order. The Family Law Section of the Oregon State Bar sponsored this
bill. Thus, the MSA/GJ and / or DRO can award all or a portion of such benefit to the AP or
surviving children.
Upon general service retirement, OPSRP will calculate the member’s monthly pension
benefit using the following formula:
1.5 x years of service x final, average salary
Example:
Final average salary -- $45,000
Yrs of service – 30
30 (yrs) x 1.5 = 45(%)
45% x $3,750 (final, monthly avg. salary) = $1,687.50
Single life option (Opt. 1) monthly benefit = $1,687.50 ($20,250 / yr)
Upon police/firefighter service retirement, OPSRP calculates the member’s monthly
benefit using the formula as set forth above, but using 1.8 as the creditable service time multiplier:
1.8 x yrs of service x final, avg salary
To further familiarize yourself with the lingo and the issues around PERS and divorce, you
can view useful divorce forms and information packets:
http://www.oregon.gov/pers/mem/pages/section/form/divorce_forms.aspx

CAVEAT: Don’t rely on PERS administrative divorce forms alone: they don’t cover all scenarios
or provide for all available alternatives. The DRO can have language that overrides the PERS
administrative forms, provided that the language in the DRO does not violate governing law.

(iv.)

OREGON SAVINGS GROWTH PLAN

In addition to OPSRP/IAP and Tier/IAP, all state and some local government employees
may participate in the Oregon Savings Growth Plan (OSGP), which is an optional deferred comp
plan (DCP) for all state and some local government employees.
C. MILITARY RETIREMENT – DIVIDING DISPOSABLE RETIRED PAY
Military retirement benefits are also extraordinarily complex and require specialized
knowledge to be properly negotiated, presented to the Court and divided. Do not attempt to
award or divide military benefits without sufficient knowledge or experience; seek expert assistance
from a DRO attorney when unsure.

PART 5: CRITICAL MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES
A. EQUALIZATION OF MULTIPLE PLANS
In cases that present several DCPs, it is often advisable and more affordable (in terms of
attorney fees) to combine the values of all DCPs (and/or IRAs) and then transferring an equalizing
amount from one Plan or IRA, rather than preparing a QDRO / DRO for each plan. But
frequently, since the road to hell is paved with good intentions, attorneys implement this principle
incorrectly and the parties wind up paying far more to fix it than they would have paid for the
multiple QDROs.
First, if the parties have not yet determined the sum to be transferred as of the time of the
signing of the MSA/GJ, then the MSA/GJ should require the parties to exchange account
statements for each account/plan as of a specified date and by a specific date. Failure to select a
date for valuation / equalization / computation purposes is often fatal because the account balances
are always changing day to day, month to month. Second, specify the calculation formula.
Generally, parties exchange the account information and total up all such accounts as of the
specified date; from there, they divide the total by 2 to ascertain how much one party needs from
the other to achieve equalization. Use an exemplary formula to illustrate the agreed upon
calculation method.

QDROphenia – Page 40

The equalizing amount to be transferred should generally be adjusted for earnings and
losses from the specified valuation date forward, but with IRA’s that is not feasible and from the
custodian’s perspective is not administrable.
Bottom line on DBPs: don’t attempt to equalize DBPs unless there is no other option and
if you must do so, then you need to undertake a professional valuation of the DBP interest.
B. RESERVATION OF LIMITED JURISDICTION
Always reserve jurisdiction in the MSA/GJ to clarify, correct, modify or amend the order with
respect to the division of retirement benefits. Whether the MSA/GJ contains the DRO, or a
DRO/QDRO will be forthcoming, or there will be an offset concerning a non-retirement asset, or
any combination of these approaches, reserving jurisdiction is the only prudent or secure approach
when it comes to division of retirement assets. Just as the court retains jurisdiction over the parties
and the subject matter when the sale of real estate will be pending after entry of the GJ, it should
retain jurisdiction over the parties and the retirement assets until the retirement plans have
received and approved the QDROs/DROs.
If you fail to reserve limited jurisdiction to address post-dissolution obstacles the retirement
benefit assignment setting, then you cannot count on the ability of a party to seek judicial relief in
the event that the parties encounter obstacles that are insurmountable without further court
involvement, the MSA/GJ fails to resolve an aspect of the assignment of retirement benefits or
omits a retirement asset, among countless other scenarios.
The rule in Oregon is that property division aspects of the GJ are not modifiable. The Court
has power to issue contempt to enforce compliance with the property division, but lacks the power
to modify the division. Drake and Drake, 36 Or App 53, 583 P2d 1165 (1978).
Here is some sample language for reserving jurisdiction in the MSA/GJ:
“Supplemental Judgments / DROs as describe above shall be filed in the instant matter and

presented to the appropriate retirement plan administrators as soon as is reasonably practicable
following the entry of this judgment. The Court reserves jurisdiction over the parties and their
retirement assets, to the extent necessary to carry out the terms, provisions and the intent of this
section, to clarify or amend this judgment, or to enter such further orders as may be reasonably
necessary to facilitate the equal distribution of the marital portion of the parties’ retirement
benefits. ”
“The Court retains jurisdiction over the parties and their retirement interests until such time as
all QDROs/DROs are filed in the instant matter and presented to and approved by the relevant
plan administrators. The Court retains jurisdiction to enter such further orders as are necessary to
enforce the terms and provisions of this judgment relating to the award and assignment of
retirement benefits, and to amend, correct or clarify the terms of this order as such terms pertain
to disposition and assignment of retirement assets.”

QDROphenia – Page 41

C. A FINAL WORD ABOUT OMITTED ASSETS
Are you at risk for allowing entry of a General Judgment that has omitted a retirement asset
altogether? Are catch-all awards effective for some plans and not others? Failure to identify a
retirement plan is often oversight and most commonly involves defined benefit plans; but
sometimes it’s intentional on the part of a party. Outcomes in these situations tend to turn on the
timing of the discovery of the omitted asset, or whether a retirement plan administrator will even
allow the participant to retire from the plan without providing a divorce (or separation) judgment
that contains identification and disposition language regarding the plan. Also critical are: (a) the
timing of the DRO lawyer’s involvement in the case (sometimes it’s literally decades after the
divorce judgment); (b) whether the General Judgment plainly states that it retains jurisdiction to
divide all retirement assets of the parties; and, (c) the attitude, willingness and problem-solving
capacity of the parties and their attorneys.

PRACTICE TIP: If an omitted retirement asset is discovered, then the discover-or should discuss
this candidly and expediently with the client and, with the client’s permission, opposing counsel (or
opposing party in the case of pro se), for the purpose of attempting to reach an agreement that
results in a corrected GJ, or a Supplemental Judgment (DRO). If your client will not authorize
you to do so, then it is generally prudent to write a letter advising against such continued
concealment, and then withdrawing from the case. Timing is important here as well (was the asset
discovered shortly after the divorce? Or years, even decades afterward?).
D. WHICH PARTY PREPARES THE DRO/QDRO?
Which Party will retain counsel to prepare the DRO/QDRO? How, if at all, will that expense
be allocated? Your MSA/GJ should answer these questions clearly.
E. FREE & CLEAR AWARDS OF RETIREMENT ASSETS.
Each and every retirement plan and retirement account should be specifically identified in the
MSA / General Judgment, regardless of whether the participant is retaining the entire interest, or
whether all or a portion will be assigned to the non-participant spouse.

PRACTICE TIP: If a spouse will retain all of his interest in a retirement plan, then make sure
that the MSA/General Judgment provides that “Husband is awarded all of his current and future
interests in the [ABC 401(k) Savings Plan], free and clear of any interest or claim by Wife.”
F. ADMINISTRATIVE, POST-DRO SETTING
The biggest post-DRO issues are taxation of post-DRO distributions/withdrawals, establishing new
survivor beneficiaries under the Plan, and each party’s (in particular the AP’s) responsibility to
keep the Plan Administrator apprised of that party’s current address / contact information. These
are all issues about which you should advise your client. At the very least, let the client know that
these are issues that he/she needs to address going forward. Assisting clients in post-DRO
administrative process is cumbersome and can get really expensive. Frequently a reasonably
financially-savvy client can manage this process on his/her own. Let your client know that these
issues exist, and that he or she may be able to address them herself or through consultation with a
retirement plan administrator or its agent, a CPA or tax-preparer, or even a trusted and competent
family member.

What is the date the amount is assigned (e.g., date of divorce)
Specify whether award is adjusted for post-assignment date account performance (consider whether
accounts are daily valued, quarterly valued, annually valued, as gains/losses will only be reflected as of
the most recent valuation date)
Consider whether AP receives a share of any employer contributions (profit sharing, matching)
attributable to P's compensation in the current plan year, since employers often don't make these
contributions-or even decide if they're going to make them-until well after the plan year end (8
months)
Consider whether the participant's account has been credited with allocations of employer contributions
attributable toP's compensation in the prior plan year
Find out if the plan is required to make profit sharing or matching contributions for the current year (e.g.,
safe harbor contributions), and if so draft accordingly
Are several tax deferred account-based retirement benefits being divided (e.g., list above plus IRA's,
SEPs), and if so are the parties willing to aggregate all and divide a single one to equalize the total (if so,
consider the next two bullets and how they may affect the equalization)
If IRAs are being divided, find out if you'll need a QDRO (usually not), and keep in mind AP can't take
penalty-free, pre-age 59.5 withdrawals from an IRA like AP can from other qualified retirement plans
Could the account include Roth contributions, and, if so, does the AP share pro rata in them
Could the account include a participant loan receivable, and if so is it included in determining any
percentage division, and might it be so large it prevents the plan from transferring APs share to AP
If AP dies before AP's account is created, and perhaps before the order is qualified, should the plan
continue with the assignment
Indicate if AP is treated as the death beneficiary for the amount of AP's award pending creation of AP's
separate account
If you have or can get an idea how long the plan(s) will take to fully process, qualify, and make
distributions with respect to the QDRO, add about 2 months and let your client know-the process takes
longer than most people think and realistic expectations can save a lot of grief
If the plan pays benefits to the wrong person what happens

Condensed list of Considerations in drafting DCP QDROs

QDROs and PARTICIPANT LOANS
(Applicable to awards from defined contribution plans)
A well-drafted QDRO for a defined contribution retirement plan, such as a 401 (k) plan
(and the dissolution judgment that provides the basis for the QDRO), should address and
resolve the issue of Participant loan balances outstanding (i.e., unpaid) as of the specified
account division date. Keep in mind that many defined contribution plans consider a Plan
Participant's outstanding loan balance as a Plan asset, with the loan balance being included as
part of the Participant's total account balance as shown on Plan records.
If there is an outstanding loan balance and the Alternate Payee is going to be awarded a

percentage of the Participant's account (as distinguished from a specified dollar amount), it is
important to specify whether the loan balance is to be INCLUDED or EXCLUDED when
calculating the Participant's total account balance.
Example:

• Participant's non-loan account balance on valuation date:

$100,000.00

• Participant's loan balance on valuation date:

$ 10.000.00

value (if loan balance is includeg):

Total account
$110,000.00

• Alternate Payee's award, if defined in QDRO as 50% of the
Participant's vested account value EXCLUDING loan balance:

$50,000.00

• Alternate Payee's award, if defined in QDRO as 50% of the
Participant's vested account value INCLUDING loan balance:

$55,000.00

NOTES:
1. If the determination of the Participant's account value includes outstanding loan
balances, the actual award payable to the Alternate Payee will nonetheless be paid (funded)
exclusively from the Participant's non-loan account assets.
2. Participant loan assets are not assignable to an Alternate Payee (even if a QDRO so
directs.) Uability for any remaining Joan balance at the time of segregation of the award will
remain the liability of the Participant.
3. The Participant's non-loan account balance must be equal to or greater than the
amount awarded to the Alternate Payee by the terms of the QDRO. If otherwise, the QDRO will
either be rejected by the Plan as non-qualified or will be interpreted by the Plan as applying only
to the non-loan assets in the Participant's account.

Condensed List of Considerations in Drafting QDROs for Formula-based Plans
(i.e•• traditional defined benefit plan, cash balance plan)

);>

Is it worth obtaining a present value of P's benefit to pennit assigning the entire benefit to P in
exchange for an asset of equal value

Does AP receive a segregated benefit based on AP's life (separate interest); or, alternatively, a share of
P's benefit payments when and as made (based on P's life) plus assignment of a share of the pre- and
post-retirement survivor annuity benefit (shared interest)
);> If AP receives a shared interest, must P elect to receive P's benefit in the form of a 50% joint and survivor
annuity
);> If AP receives a shared interest, is P required to retire and commence benefits no later than a certain date
);> If AP receives a separate interest, does AP receive a share of the frozen benefit as of a set date (e.g., date
of divorce), or a share of the true benefit as of the date the benefit goes to pay status
);> If AP receives a separate interest is the marital share determined using the "time rule" marital fraction, or
some other agreed fractional share ofP's benefit
);> If AP receives a separate interest may AP take AP's share at any time permitted by the plan (generally
age 55), subject to reductions for early retirement adjustments; and what ifP later receives an enhanced
benefit (e.g., early retirement benefit)
);> Is P required to make reasonable efforts to qualify for enhanced benefits under special plan rules (e.g.,
rule of 65172180185; 70/80 eligibility)
);> Does the plan provide a secondary death benefit in addition to the pre-and/or post-retirement survivor
annuity benefit, and if so does AP get any part of it
);> Does AP receive a proportionate share of any benefit enhancement (e.g., early retirement, thirteenth
month checks)
);> Does AP receive a proportionate share of any COLA or COLA-like benefit increase
);> If AP dies before either party initiates benefits does APs share get paid to contingent beneficiaries (if
permitted by the plan), does it revert toP, or does it get absorbed by the plan
);> If AP's benefit is protected by assignment of the pre-retirement survivor annuity prior to benefit
commencement-and it generally should be, does AP receive some or all of the benefit (or does AP's
share depend on whether P is married at the time of death)
);> If AP's share of the pre-retirement survivor annuity is limited to the "marital share" is the marital share
equal to or double the marital "time-rule" fraction
);> Consider how the AP's failure to waive the pre-retirement survivor annuity, and how protection of AP's
interest with a pre-and/or post survivor annuity benefit affect the value of P's benefit, and who should
pick up the "cost" of these AP benefits and how
);> Has AP irrevocably waived AP's right to the pre-retirement survivor annuity
);> If AP predeceases P, and P dies before benefits commence, do death benefits get paid toP's beneficiary
or AP's contingent beneficiaries
);> If AP dies before AP's separate interest is established, and perhaps before the order is qualified, should
the plan continue processing the division
);> If the plan pays benefits to the wrong person what happens

Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) Plan 2
Benefit Estimate Worksheet

Department of
Retirement Systems

As a member of PERS Plan 2, you can use this worksheet to estimate the benefit you will receive at retirement as
a member of PERS Plan 2. To assist you in completing the worksheet, the right-hand column shows a sample of
information that you would enter. Please keep in mind that this is an estimate only and is based on projected salary and
service credit Your actual benefit at retirement may differ. (See page 4 for general information about your retirement
plan.)

PERS l!laf! 2 Benefit Estimate Worksheet
Step 1: Determine the age at which you plan to retire.
1. Your age at retirement:
Step 2: Determine your total service credit at retirement.
2a. Your current balance of service credit years:
2b. The number of years until your retirement:
2c. Your projected service credit years at retirement (2a + 2b):

You

~am~le

65

22
+ 8

30

Step 3: Estimate your Average Final Compensation (AFC).
See page 4 for an explanation of AFC. If your retirement date is
many years in the future, your future AFC may differ from its
current level. You may wish to estimate your future salary, then
figure an AFC based on those figures.

3. Your estimated AFC:
Step 4: Compute your Option 1 (Single Life) benefit.
The Option 1 (Single Life) benefit provides you with the highest
monthly benefit However, payments stop upon your death and
do not continue to a survivor. The formula for your Option 1
monthly benefit is: 2% x Service Credit Years x AFC

4. Your Option 1 benefit amount:

$3,340 per month

2% X 30 X $3,340 =
$2,004 per mo.

Complete the next step only if you will provide for a survivor.
There are three survivor options available. Under each of these options, your Option 1 benefit is reduced in order
to provide a continuing payment to a survivor after your death. If you choose one of the survivor options and your
designated survivor dies before you, your benefit will be adjusted to the higher Option 1 payment level. Be sure to
notify DRS to initiate th is adjustment The administrative factors used in these examples are for illustrative purposes
only. See the Administrative Factors page for the most cun·ent numbers.
Step 5. Adjust your benefit for a survivor option.
Determine the age difference between you (the member) and
your survivor (rounded to the nearest year). Then find the
survivor option factors that apply to your age difference.

Your age is 65; your
survivor's age is 63.

Sa. The age difference between you and your survivor:

You are 2 years older

Option 2 (Joint and 100% Survivor) - When you die your
survivor receives a benefit equal to 100% of your benefit.

$2,004 X 0.783 =
$1,569 per mo.

5b. Your Option 2 benefit amount:

Sample

$2,004 X 0.878 =
$1.760 per mo.
(survivor gets $880)

$2,004 X 0.844 =$1,691
per mo.
(survivor gets $1,127)

Complete the next step only if you will retire before normal retirement at age 65.
When you retire early, your benefit is reduced to reflect that you will receive it over a longer period of time. The
amount of the impact depends on your service credit, the date you retire, your age and the early retirement factor
used. The administrative factors used in these examples are for illustrative purposes only. See the Administrative
Factors page for the most current numbers.
Step 6: Adjust your benefit for early retirement.
If your age at retirement in Step 1 is less than 65, multiply the
benefit amount as determined in Step 4 or Step 5 by the factor
for your age.

Note: If you are retiring with at least 30 years of service
credit and are at least age 55. see the table on page 3 for
your ERF.
6. Your adjusted benefit amount:

Assume you retire at
age 60 with 2 5 years of
service and your Option
1 benefit is $1,500.
$1,500 X 0.588 = $882
per mo.

In Oregon

Presentation by Amy Margolis
EMERGE LAW GROUP
Recreational Marijuana in Oregon
October 9, 2015

General Themes of Measure 91
► Minimize

the illegal market and prevent revenue
from going to criminal enterprises
Incentivize private businesses to enter into the
regulated market
 Incentivize adult consumers to purchase from licensed
retailers


► Regulate

in a manner substantially similar to beer

and wine
Oregon Liquor Control Commission as regulatory
agency
 Parallel the Oregon Liquor Act as much as possible


► Enforcement

priorities specified in the Cole Memo

US Department of Justice Cole Memo
(August 29, 2013)
►

Federal enforcement priorities









►

Prevent distribution to minors
Prevent revenue from going to criminal enterprises
Prevent diversion of marijuana to other states
Prevent trafficking of other illegal drugs
Prevent violence
Prevent drugged driving and other adverse public health consequences
Prevent growing of marijuana on public lands
Prevent possession and use of marijuana on federal property

“In jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing marijuana in
some form and that have also implemented strong and effective
regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation,
distribution, sale, and possession of marijuana, conduct in
compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to
threaten the federal priorities set forth above. Indeed, a robust
system may affirmatively address those priorities.”

cruelty or inappropriate
sexual comments.

Physical Abuse & Abandonment
 Physical injury or pain


elderly person caused by
other than accidental
means, or which appears
to be at variance with
the explanation given of
the injury.” ORS

communicative or non responsive.
 Unpaid bills, overdue rent, utility shutoff notices.

Reasonable Cause
to Believe

What is Reasonable Cause?
 DHS advice is to report any “reasonable suspicion of

abuse.”
 Reasonable suspicion is more than a hunch – ability
to point to articulable facts based on totality of the
circumstances.
 Court may look to “whether the evidence creates a
reasonable suspicion of child abuse, not whether
abuse in fact occurred or even probably occurred.”
Berger v. SOSCF, 195 Or App 587 (2004)
(interpreting analogous child abuse reporting
provision).

Contact with Elder
or Abuser

What is Contact?
 Contact need not be to be linked to abuse
 Can have contact before or after learning of abuse
 Direct vs. Indirect Contact?
 Oregon Attorney General interpreted “contact” element of
child abuse reporting requirement to require more than board
members’ receipt of information about abuse through board
because acquisition of information was too indirect.
AG Op. No. 5543
 Email or phone?
 No statutory definition

or case law interpreting

Hypothetical No. 1
Max, who just turned 89, comes to you for legal advice.
He has been married to his wife Sandy, who is 79, for
30 years. Recently, Sandy was diagnosed with
Alzheimer’s disease, and she moved into a memory
care facility. Shortly thereafter, Sandy’s daughter
from her first marriage appeared and removed Sandy
from care facility to a facility in New Mexico, where
she lives. Now Sandy has filed for divorce. Sandy’s
attorney has moved the court for the appointment of a
GAL.

Hypothetical No. 1 Cont.
Max suspects that his step-daughter is orchestrating
the divorce in order to increase her share of her
mother’s estate upon death. Max shows you a copy of
Sandy’s estate plan which shows that her daughter will
inherit twice as much from Sandy if she is not married
at the time of her death. Max admits his marriage with
Sandy was on the rocks before she moved into the care
facility, but claims that was due to her health issues.
Max is distraught and misses Sandy. Do you have a
duty to report elder abuse?

Hypothetical No. 2
Janice has been served with a divorce petition. During
your initial consultation, Janice tells you that she is
concerned that her husband Alex has been “living off”
his ailing mother, who she describes as being “in her
70s.” Janice explains that Alex has not had a job for
twenty years, and that for the past ten years they have
lived with Alex’s mom and she has paid for all of their
household expenses. Do you have a duty to report
elder abuse?

Hypothetical No. 3
You are representing Pat, a 69 year old woman, in a
dissolution. When you review copies of Pat’s banking
records you notice that there are large withdrawals
coming out of her savings account. When you ask Pat
about the withdrawals, she explains that her niece
Jane has been taking care of her for the past year, and
that she writes Jane regular checks to help pay for
groceries. You do some math, and realize that Jane
has received $30,000 over the past year.

Hypothetical No. 3 Cont.
You share this information with Pat and she is shocked
that the number is so high, saying, “I can’t believe I’ve
given Jane that much money. She didn’t spend it on
groceries, that’s for sure.” You know that Pat has been
experiencing some mild dementia and is under the
care of a doctor. When you bring up the idea that Jane
may be taking advantage of her, Pat is adamant that
she loves Jane and doesn’t want to do anything about
it. Do you have a duty to report elder abuse?

Aging Process Changes

Mental and cognitive:

Some cognitive and mental functions
decline
Some cognitive skills including judgment,
creativity, common sense, and breadth of
knowledge and experience, are maintained
or improved.
Some cognitive skills, including
abstraction, calculation, word frequency,
verbal comprehension, and inductive
reasoning, show slight or gradual decline.

Normal Aging Outcomes

Short-term memory declines but long-term recall is
usually maintained
Difficulty understanding abstract content.
Learning abilities change—older adults are more
cautious in their responses; are capable of learning
new things but their speed of processing
information is slower.

Lawyers’ New Mandatory Abuse Reporting Requirement
By Amber Hollister

Elder Abuse

Protecting and advocating for vulnerable older
Oregonians is a critical part of the work many
lawyers do — day in and day out. Expanding
the list of mandatory reporters to include our
profession is one more important way to help
ensure these people are safe from harm.
—Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum

L

awyers across Oregon are talking
about elder abuse reporting. On Jan.
1, 2015, legislation took effect making all Oregon lawyers mandatory reporters
of elder abuse. HB 2205 (2013). As with
any new law, there are still many questions
about how the new requirements will apply
and impact lawyers’ day-to-day practice.
This month’s bar counsel column outlines
the basics of the requirement.
The new reporting requirement was
enacted at the recommendation of the
Oregon Elder Abuse Prevention Work
Group, which was tasked with studying
how to better protect older Oregonians.
As state Rep. Val Hoyle notes, “For four

years, the work group has focused on protecting some of Oregon’s most vulnerable
citizens. Integrating lawyers into Oregon’s
elder abuse safety net as mandatory reporters will provide our state with over
19,000 additional advocates.”
While the elder abuse reporting requirement is new, lawyers have long been
mandatory reporters of child abuse, abuse
of developmentally disabled adults and
abuse of long-term care residents. See
ORS 419B.005(5)(m); ORS 430.735(12)
(i); ORS 441.630(6)(i). These existing
reporting obligations remain intact.
Part of the reason for the increased focus on elder abuse is that Oregon is in the
midst of a demographic shift — as baby
boomers age, our population as a whole
is aging. The Oregon Office of Economic
Analysis forecasts that between 2010 and
2020, the number of Oregonians aged 65
to 74 will grow by 36 percent. The median age of Oregon’s population was 30.3
in 1980, but is forecast to rise to 39.7 by
2020. 1And elder abuse is a significant
problem in Oregon. In 2013, the state
investigated and substantiated over 4,000
instances of elder abuse.2
The Legislature has high hopes that
the new attorney reporting obligation will
provide additional protection to elders.
“The addition of Oregon lawyers as mandatory reporters of elder abuse will shine a
bright new light on abuse in our communities,” explains Rep. Vic Gilliam. “Lawyers who receive elder abuse prevention
training will be even further equipped to
recognize warning signs and report their
concerns to appropriate authorities.”
The Basics
So what exactly is the elder abuse
reporting requirement? In its most condensed form, the new law requires a lawyer

to report elder abuse when he or she has
reasonable cause to believe elder abuse has
occurred, and the lawyer has had contact
with the elder or the alleged abuser. See
ORS 124.060.The requirement applies to
lawyers 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
The law includes exceptions to protect attorney-client privileged information and
information learned during the course of
representing a client that would be detrimental to the client if disclosed.
Much of the law’s complexity stems
from the way in which the terms elder,
reasonable cause and abuse are defined.
First, lawyers should note that the law defines elders broadly to include all people
aged 65 or older who are not currently
residents of a long-term care facility. ORS
124.050(2). An elder need not be vulnerable or lacking in capacity to be covered
by the law.
Reasonable cause is not defined by the
law, but has been interpreted by Oregon
courts in an analogous child abuse reporting context to mean reasonable suspicion.3 A lawyer has reasonable suspicion
to believe elder abuse has occurred if the

Ongoing Conversation
The elder abuse reporting requirement is part of an ongoing conversation in Salem about how to best
prevent elder abuse. The Oregon
Elder Abuse Prevention Work Group
welcomes comments from attorneys about the new requirements.
The work group’s meetings are

members interested in attending

lawyer can articulate facts, based on the
totality of the circumstances, that would
lead a reasonable person to believe that
the abuse occurred. This means that the
evidentiary standard for reporting elder
abuse is relatively low. Because probable
cause is not required, a lawyer need not
believe it is more likely than not that
abuse occurred to trigger reporting.
The definition of abuse is the most
intricate piece of the reporting scheme.
Elder abuse is defined to encompass a
myriad of circumstances including physical abuse, neglect, financial exploitation,
verbal abuse and sexual abuse. See ORS
124.050(1) et seq. For lawyers who are accustomed to analyzing their obligation to
report child abuse, it is important to note
there are some substantial differences in
the definitions of elder abuse and child
abuse.
Some of the definitions of elder abuse,
including the definitions of physical abuse
and neglect, are fairly straightforward.
Physical abuse is elder abuse. Any willful
infliction of physical pain or injury to an
elder is considered abuse, as is the wrongful use of a physical or chemical restraint
on an elder. More broadly, elder abuse
is defined to include any nonaccidental
physical injury to an elder, and any physical injury that appears to be at variance
with the explanation given of the injury.
Neglect is also elder abuse. Neglecting an elder by withholding the basic care
or services the elder needs to maintain
health and safety is deemed elder abuse.
Depending on the specific circumstances
and capacity of the elder, what is considered a basic care or service may change.
Abandonment of an elder is defined as
abuse, particularly where a caregiver or
other person is neglecting duties and obligations that are owed to an elder. Involuntary seclusion of an elderly person as a
measure of discipline or for the caregiver’s
convenience is also abuse.
Sexual abuse and sexual exploitation
are elder abuse. Any nonconsensual sexual contact between an elder and caregiver
is included in the definition.
Certain categories of verbal threats
are also considered elder abuse. Specifically, threatening an elder with significant
physical or emotional harm by using “derogatory or inappropriate names, insults,
verbal assaults, profanity or ridicule” or
OREGON STATE BAR BULLETIN • JANUARY 2015

“[h]arassment, coercion, threats, intimidation, humiliation, mental cruelty or inappropriate sexual comments” is deemed
abuse. ORS 124.050(13).
Financial Exploitation
The type of elder abuse that has generated the most discussion in the legal community to date is financial exploitation.
Financial exploitation is defined in ORS
124.050(4) as:
a) Wrongfully taking the assets,
funds or property belonging to
or intended for the use of an elderly person or a person with a
disability;
b) Alarming an elderly person or
a person with a disability by
conveying a threat to wrongfully take or appropriate money
or property of the person if the
person would reasonably believe that the threat conveyed
would be carried out;
c) Misappropriating, misusing or
transferring without authorization any money from any account held jointly or singly by
an elderly person or a person
with a disability; or
d) Failing to use the income or
assets of an elderly person or a
person with a disability effec-

Some Warning Signs of Abuse
•

Any unexplained injury that
doesn’t fit with the given
explanation of the injury.
• The elder is not given the
opportunity to speak for
him or herself without the
presence of the caregiver.
• The elder has become
extremely withdrawn and

nonresponsive.

tively for the support and maintenance of the person.
Certainly, individuals who abuse their
powers as an elder’s attorney-in-fact,
guardian or conservator to improperly
enrich themselves would be engaged in
financial exploitation. Similarly, individuals who threaten to harm an elderly
person or an elder’s loved ones in order
to reap a financial benefit would be engaged in abuse. Refusing to use an elder’s
income or assets to pay for basics such as
food, housing or medical care would also
likely fall within the definition of abuse.
Lawyers who regularly represent elders in transactions or business deals have
expressed a desire for more clarity in the
definition of financial exploitation. In
response, the work group is discussing
possible amendments to the definition
of financial exploitation and the phrase
“wrongful taking.” 4 Open questions remain about how the new elder abuse reporting requirement will interact with
existing civil financial elder abuse protections. See ORS 124.110.
Contact
Before the duty to report elder abuse is
triggered, an attorney must have contact
with an elder or alleged abuser. Although
contact is not defined by the statute, contact is commonly defined as a coming together. Being in the room with a person or
communicating with a person by phone
or email is likely enough to meet the contact element. On the other hand, merely
hearing news reports or reading pleadings
about an incident of abuse will not be
enough to trigger the duty to report.
Client Confidentiality
Even if a lawyer has reasonable cause
to believe elder abuse has occurred, and
has had contact with the elder or abuser,
the lawyer still must examine whether the
exceptions to reporting for client confidentiality apply. Lawyers do not have an
obligation to report elder abuse if doing
so would reveal attorney-client privileged
information or would reveal information
learned while representing a client that
would be detrimental to the client if disclosed. ORS 124.060. If a client consents
to the lawyer reporting the abuse, the lawyer could of course make a report. RPC
1.6(a).5

How to Report
To report elder abuse, lawyers should
make an immediate verbal report to law
enforcement or the Department of Human Services. Lawyers can call (855) 503SAFE to report elder or child abuse any
time of day or night. If harm is imminent,
lawyers should call 911. Lawyers who
have reasonable grounds to report elder
abuse and report in good faith are entitled
to civil immunity. ORS 124.075(1).

3. In Berger v. State Office for Services to
Children and Families, 195 Or App 587, 590
(2004), the court noted that the agency’s determination of whether child abuse charges
are founded is limited only to “whether
there is evidence that creates a reasonable
suspicion of child abuse; [the agency] does
not decide whether child abuse in fact occurred or even probably occurred.”
4. Although “wrongfully taking” is not defined
by the statute, the Oregon Court of Appeals
in Church v. Woods, 190 Or App 112 (2003),
explored the meaning of “wrongful taking”
in the separate context of meeting the standard for obtaining a temporary restraining
order against financial elder abuse. See ORS
124.110 et seq. In Church, the court held
that obtaining a joint interest in real property
from an incapacitated elder was a “taking”
of property, for purposes of establishing a
statutory claim for financial abuse. The court
also held that the taking was “wrongful”
based both on the defendant’s motives and
the means by which property was taken. It
is unclear whether a court would use this
same definition when interpreting “wrongful
taking” as used in the reporting statute, ORS
124.050(4)(a).
5. Similarly, if a lawyer reasonably believes that
reporting elder abuse is necessary to prevent
reasonably certain substantial bodily harm
or death or to prevent a client’s commission
of a future crime, reporting is allowed. RPC
1.6(b)(1)-(2). These exceptions to RPC 1.6
have been narrowly construed.

SOCIAL MEDIA: HIT THE “LIKE” BUTTON
FOR USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN YOUR CASES
By Matthew A. Levin and Steffan Alexander,
Markowitz Herbold PC

INTRODUCTION
Social Media is defined as “forms of electronic communication (as Web sites for social
networking and microblogging) through which users create online communities to share
information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos).”1
In family law cases, social media evidence is often requested as proof of a party’s
character or fault in a matter, including evidence of extramarital affairs and engagement
in activities that would adversely affect the best interests of a child.2
WHERE TO LOOK FOR SOCIAL MEDIA
There are over 800 social media sites used in the US and around the globe. These sites
are used for sharing your life, photos, chatting, business, dating, group activities, blogs,
and many more. The 15 most popular social media sites as ranked in order by eBizMBA,
include: (1) Facebook, (2) Twitter, (3) LinkedIn, (4) Pinterest, (5) Google Plus+,
(6) Tumblr, (7) Instagram, (8) VK, (9) Flickr, (10) Vine, (11) Meetup, (12) Tagged,
(13) Ask.fm, (14) MeetMe, and (15) ClassMates.3 Social Media sites are constantly
evolving. One of the newest sites is Pheed, which is a multimedia site for photos, video,
and music. It enables users to create, inspire, and share text, photos, videos, audio tracks,
voice-notes, and live broadcasts.
Social media mobile chatting is also becoming more prevalent. For example, Kik is a
chat application used by kids to chat with their friends as an alternative to texting. It uses
a username rather than a phone number to connect with friends. Whatsapp is an instant
messaging application used on mobile devices that is gaining popularity. In addition,
Snapchat is a private messaging application used for photos and short videos that
automatically delete unless the user specifically saves the messages.
PRE-LITIGATION SOCIAL MEDIA CONSIDERATIONS
In the early stages of litigation, social media could be a factor in (1) the parties’
obligation to preserve and collect relevant evidence as part of a litigation hold, (2) the
pre-litigation investigation of potential adverse witnesses and opposing counsel, and
(3) the parties’ ability to locate and serve adverse parties.4
I.

Social media preservation.

The duty to preserve potentially relevant evidence arises when a party reasonably
anticipates litigation.5 This duty applies equally to social media content.6 A user sued
in an individual capacity has a duty to preserve relevant social media content that the
individual can obtain on demand.7
A.

Litigation holds.

Attorneys drafting a litigation hold should consider specifically referencing social media
platforms, including any associated and collectable metadata.8 Attorneys sending a
Page 1 of 13

demand letter to an adversary requesting preservation of relevant ESI should consider
identifying social media platforms as potential sources of relevant information.9
B.

Data collection.

Printouts, screenshots, or web crawlers used to gather static images may be inconsistent
with the format sought in a request for production or subpoena, and may be insufficient
for authentication.10 Attorneys should consider engaging an e-discovery vendor for
collection of social media content and associated metadata.11
In addition, use of e-discovery software may help establish authenticity by generating
hash values (unique document identifiers) for collected social media items and
automatically creating collections logs.12
C.

Spoliation of social media content.

Attorneys should collect and preserve social media content early in litigation because
social media sites can terminate an account or membership and delete content.13
Attorneys should specifically instruct clients to not destroy or alter social media content
where it may be relevant to anticipated or ongoing litigation.14
1.

Spoliation – standard of proof.

For a court to impose sanctions, the moving party must show: (1) the content was in the
alleged spoliator’s control, (2) the alleged spoliator had an obligation to preserve the
content (or could reasonably foresee that the content would be discoverable), (3) the
content was destroyed or significantly altered with a culpable state of mind (some courts
require only negligence), and (4) the content was relevant to claims or defenses.15
2.

Spoliation – remedies.

Remedies for spoliation of social media content are often based on the spoliating party’s
state of mind in destroying or altering the content and the level of prejudice to the
opposing party.16 Remedies may include (1) an adverse inference jury instruction that the
deleted or altered social media content was harmful to the spoliating party’s case,
(2) evidence preclusion, and (3) dismissal of claims or a judgment in favor of the
prejudiced party.17 Sanctions may also include fines or attorney fees.18
II.

Investigation of other parties and witnesses.

A lawyer should conduct internet and social media research on: the subject matter of
the case; potential parties; opposing counsel, and potential witnesses.19
III.

Service of process.

Courts typically deny requests to serve process through social media sites. Some reasons
include (1) the uncertainty surrounding authentication, given the potential for duplicate or
false accounts, and (2) a lack of confidence that a message posted on social media is
highly likely to reach the defendants or satisfy due process requirements.20 However, at
least one court recently allowed international service of process via social media.21 The
court allowed service of process to the defendant (allegedly located in Turkey) through
email, Facebook, and LinkedIn.22 The court granted the motion, holding that these
methods were likely to provide the defendant with notice of the litigation because an
individual identifying himself as the defendant had responded to email from an account
Page 2 of 13

associated with the social media platforms.23 In addition, the defendant appeared to have
recently accessed and updated both his Facebook and LinkedIn accounts.24
In another case, the court allowed service of motions and other post-summons documents
on the defendants (allegedly located in India) through Facebook, where Facebook served
as a secondary or backstop means of service, in addition to email.25
IV.

Pre-litigation social media investigation – ethical considerations.

Attorneys must keep the rules of professional conduct in mind when conducting
pre-litigation investigation using social media.26
ORPC 4.2 requires that a lawyer will not communicate or cause another to communicate
on the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by
a lawyer on that subject, unless the lawyer has the prior consent of a lawyer representing
such other person.
ORPC 4.1 mandates that a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material
fact or law to a third person.
It may be a violation of the rules of professional conduct for a lawyer to request greater
access to a user’s account under pretext, without being forthright about the request and
fully disclosing the purpose of the request.27
Others have commented that, in general, a lawyer investigating a case using social media:
1.

may access the public portions of a party’s or witness’s social media account,
regardless of whether or not the party or witness is represented;

2.

may not access private or non-public portions of a represented party’s or
witness’s social media account if the lawyer is required to “friend” or
“follow” the account or account user; and

3.

may “friend” or “follow” an unrepresented party or witness on social media
if the lawyer does not engage in “deceptive behavior.”28

Interpretation of “deceptive behavior” differs across jurisdictions.29 In some
jurisdictions, a lawyer can join a social network and “friend” an unrepresented individual
without disclosing the reasons for the request, as long as it does not involve any type of
trickery.30 In other words, the lawyer must use his or her full name and have an accurate
profile.31 Other states require that a lawyer affirmatively disclose his or her role in the
dispute or litigation, and identify the client matter.32 The reasoning is that failure to do so
may be an omission of material fact, and thereby amounts to deceptive conduct.33 Other
state bar associations provide that a lawyer must inform the social media account holder
of the intended use of the information, whether generally for litigation or specifically to
impeach a witness.34
V.

Pre-litigation investigation – social media privacy settings.

Attorneys should try to protect a client’s social media content from an adversary by
maximizing the client’s privacy settings.35 Conversely, attorneys should seek out as
much relevant public social media content as possible. Such content can support the
basis for disclosure of non-public information.36

Page 3 of 13

Attorneys should also be aware of their own privacy settings.37 LinkedIn users will
receive a notification that their account was viewed.38 An adversary or witness will be
alerted to the lawyer’s investigative efforts.39 To avoid such notifications, privacy
options should be selected that make the lawyer anonymous.40
SOCIAL MEDIA DISCOVERY
I.

Possession, custody, and control.41

An individual social media user typically has “control” of his or her own social media
content (to the extent he or she can still access it) because the user usually has the legal
right, authority, or practical ability to obtain the materials sought.42
A corporation that has the ultimate authority to control, to add, to delete, or modify a
website stored on its own servers has possession, custody, or control of the content.43
II.

Subpoenas to non-party media providers.

Some social media providers indicate on their websites or in other official documents
that they may produce only limited user or account data or public content, but not private
content, pursuant to a valid federal or state subpoena.44
These restrictions are driven by providers’ concerns of running afoul of the Stored
Communications Act (“SCA”). The SCA prohibits “a person or entity providing an
electronic communication service to the public” from “knowingly divulg[ing] to any
person or entity the contents of a communication while in electronic storage by that
service . . . .”45 “‘Electronic communications service’ means any service which provides
to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications . . . .”46
The SCA protections apply only to private communications and not those readily
accessible to the general public.47 The SCA has been interpreted to encompass social
media content, such as, wall posts on a restricted-access Facebook account, comments
on a restricted-access Myspace account, private messages on Facebook and Myspace, and
YouTube videos.48 In other words, social media sites, such as, Facebook and Myspace
are electronic communications services with respect to wall posts and comments, and the
SCA will apply to prohibit social media services from divulging the content of such wall
posts and comments.49 In one case, Facebook objected to a third-party subpoena that
sought production of the plaintiff’s social media content due to concerns regarding the
SCA.50 Facebook suggested that the plaintiff download the entire content of his account
using the site’s “Download Your Information” tool as an alternative method for
producing the information.51
The SCA does not have an exception for civil subpoenas.52 Courts have held that users
of the services have standing to quash subpoenas directed to third-party service providers
when those subpoenas seek the users’ electronic information.53
The SCA also bars third parties from improperly accessing electronic communication
maintained by an electronic communication service provider.54 It prescribes criminal
penalties and a private right of action against anyone who: intentionally accesses without
authorization a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided;
or intentionally exceeds an authorization to access that facility; and thereby obtains,
alters, or prevents authorized access to a wire or electronic communication while it is in
electronic storage in such system.55

Page 4 of 13

This prohibition can apply to attorneys.56 The Ninth Circuit stated that the attorneys
who issued subpoenas to an adverse parties’ ISP seeking the adverse parties’ email
“transparently and egregiously” violated the Federal Rules, and acted in bad faith and
with gross negligence in drafting and deploying the subpoena.57 The underlying trial
court sanctioned the attorneys.58 Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held that the victims
could maintain civil claims against the attorneys for violating the SCA because the ISP
actually responded to the subpoena by providing some emails for the attorneys to
review.59
Rather than risk violation of the SCA, an attorney may seek social media
communications directly from the user.60 If voluntary consent is not provided then the
attorney may have to seek a court order compelling the user to provide the necessary
consent.61 In that case, the attorney should place the service provider on notice that the
attorney is seeking voluntary or compelled consent.62 The attorney should also request
that the service provider preserve or backup the social media information, and offer to
pay the reasonable costs associated with such preservation.63 The general rule is that
there is no duty to preserve possible evidence for a party to aid another party in some
future legal action against a third party, absent some special relationship, contractual or
statutory duty, or other special circumstance.64
III.

Document requests.

Attorneys can craft document requests to reach social media content and related metadata
by specifying that the definition of “document” and “ESI” include social media content.65
For example, defining the term “document” to include all information published at any
time on any site or mobile application, including but not limited to all social networking
or social media sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube or other
social media providers.66
Lawyers can also include a separate document request that specifically seeks social media
content.67 For example, all social media postings, comments, messages or other content
relating to the allegations in the Complaint, including but not limited to content from
Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, or other social media providers.68
In addition, lawyers may specify in the instructions that documents and ESI must be
produced with all available metadata.69 For example, provide an instruction that
“Electronically Stored Information (ESI), including but not limited to social media
content, must be produced and continue to be preserved in its original native format
with all relevant metadata, including but not limited to any author, creation date and time,
modified date and time, native file path, native file name, and file type.70
IV.

Interrogatories.

In federal court, interrogatories may be used to identify (1) social media platforms or
accounts established, used or maintained by the responding party, and (2) email accounts
or addresses and networks that are related to or associated with the responding party’s
social media accounts.71 Interrogatories can also be used to learn all names, usernames,
or pseudonyms, commonly referred to as “handles,” associated with the responding
party’s social media accounts.72
V.

Responding to discovery requests for social media.

Courts are generally dismissive of privacy claims over non-public social media content
because the non-public content is available to select third parties who may do with it
what they wish.73
Page 5 of 13

The typical objections to production of social media are relevance, and undue burden.74
VI.

Relevance of discovery requests.

Various courts have already found that social media content that is relevant to the
litigation is discoverable.75 However, discovery requests that seek the entire content of
a person’s social media site without any date or subject-matter restriction can be akin to
asking for every photo album that a person has access to, or asking for copies of every
letter that the person has ever sent or received.76 Courts will routinely deny requests for
unfettered access to all social media messages, postings, and history.77 Therefore, just
like discovery request for other types of information, discovery requests seeking social
media content should be narrowly tailored to seek only relevant information.78
VII.

Resolving social media disputes.

Federal courts have adopted varied approaches to resolving disputes involving requests
for social media.79 Some federal courts require an initial demonstration that the public
portion of someone’s social media contains relevant evidence that justifies disclosure of
the private portions.80 Other federal courts have allowed broad disclosure of social media
information with the only restriction being the relevant time frame at issue in the
lawsuit.81 Some federal courts take the middle ground by permitting limited disclosure
with set parameters on what a party must disclose.82 Another approach that federal courts
have taken is to conduct an in camera review of a party’s social media postings and
determine what is discoverable.83 Courts have also narrowed the scope of proposed
discovery by ordering a party’s counsel, and not the party, to review the social media
content and determine the relevance of postings.84 Other courts, have instructed the
requesting party’s counsel to review all social media content, and inform opposing
counsel of relevant information that was not produced where the discovery record
suggested that the producing party may have withheld information relevant to the
litigation.85
ADMISSIBILITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA
For electronically stored information to be admissible, it must be (1) relevant,
(2) authentic, (3) not hearsay or admissible under an exception to rule barring hearsay
evidence, (4) original, duplicate or admissible as secondary evidence to prove its
contents, and (5) probative value must outweigh its prejudicial effect.86
I.

Relevance.

Under Oregon law, “relevant evidence” means evidence having any tendency to make
the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more
probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. OEC 401. As
previously mentioned, several cases have found that social media evidence is relevant.
See eg. 121 Am. Jur. Proof of Facts 3d 1 § 10, citing Melissa G v. North Babylon Union
Free School Dist., 6 N.Y.S.3d 445, 2015 WL 1727598 (Sup 2015) (concluding that
private information sought from student’s social media account was relevant to school
district’s defense of student’s claim for damages for loss of enjoyment of life).
II.

Authentication.

Under Oregon law, OEC 901(1) requires that the authentication or identification as a
condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a
finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.
Page 6 of 13

OEC 901(2) provides non-exclusive examples of authentication or identification
conforming with the requirements of subsection OEC 901 (1):
“(a) Testimony by a witness with knowledge that a matter is what it is claimed to
be.
(b) Nonexpert opinion as to the genuineness of handwriting, based upon
familiarity not acquired for purposes of the litigation.
(c) Comparison by the trier of fact or by expert witnesses with specimens which
have been authenticated.
(d) Appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns or other distinctive
characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances.87
(e) Identification of a voice, whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or
electronic transmission or recording, by opinion based upon hearing the voice
at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.
(f) Telephone conversations, by evidence that a call was made to the number
assigned at the time by the telephone company to a particular person or
business, if:
(A) In the case of a person, circumstances, including self-identification,
show the person answering to be the one called; or
(B) In the case of a business, the call was made to a place of business and
the conversation related to business reasonably transacted over the
telephone.
(g) Evidence that a writing authorized by law to be recorded or filed and in fact
recorded or filed in a public office, or a purported public record, report,
statement, or data compilation, in any form, is from the public office where
items of this nature are kept.
(h) Evidence that a document or data compilation, in any form:
(A) Is in such condition as to create no suspicion concerning its
authenticity;
(B) Was in a place where it, if authentic, would likely be; and
(C) Has been in existence 20 years or more at the time it is offered.
(i) Evidence describing a process or system used to produce a result and showing
that the process or system produces an accurate result.
(j) Any method of authentication or identification otherwise provided by law or
by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. [1981 c.892 §68]”
OEC 901(a), (c), (d), (g), and (i) are the most likely means for authenticating social
media in Oregon state courts.88 Federal courts have recognized analogous federal rules of
evidence as being particularly appropriate for authenticating digital evidence.89 Some
federal courts have relied on other rules to authenticate and admit evidence taken from
Page 7 of 13

social media.90 One United States District Court admitted Facebook posts under the
residual hearsay exception in FRE 807 based on credible evidence that the posts were
authentic.91 The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that screenshots of Facebook
pages and YouTube videos retrieved from a Google server were self-authenticating
business records under FRE 902(11) where they were accompanied by certification from
Facebook and YouTube records custodians.92
OEC 104(1) authorizes the court to make a preliminary determination about the
admissibility of evidence. Authenticity is one of those preliminary determinations.93
OEC 104(2) (sometimes referred to as the “conditional relevance rule”) may come into
play when there is a genuine dispute of fact regarding whether an exhibit is authentic,
such as, when the proponent of the evidence offers facts to establish authenticity that
would be sufficient to persuade a reasonable jury by a preponderance of the evidence that
the exhibit is authentic, but at the same time, the party seeking to exclude the evidence
offers other evidence that could persuade a reasonable jury that the exhibit is not
authentic.94 OEC 104(2) instructs that when the relevancy of evidence depends upon the
fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the
introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of the condition.
When a conditional relevance issue arises, the proper action for the trial judge to take is
to conditionally admit the evidence and instruct the jurors that if they agree with the
proponent, they may consider the evidence, giving it the weight they think it deserves.95
If the jurors side with the opponent, however, they should not consider the evidence.96
If the judge finds that the evidence is clearly authentic, or clearly inauthentic, and
determines that a reasonable jury could not find to the contrary, “the judge withdraws
the matter from [the jury’s] consideration.”97 However, if the judge determines that a
jury could reasonably find the evidence to be authentic, the evidence goes to the jury to
“‘ultimately resolve[] whether evidence admitted . . . is that which the proponent
claims.”98 When there is plausible evidence of both authenticity and inauthenticity, the
trial judge should not exclude the evidence.99 But some cases have taken a different
approach by not admitting social media evidence unless the court definitively determines
that the evidence is authentic.100
III.

Hearsay.

The use of social media as a party admission is frequently the easiest and most direct
method to offer the information into evidence, and overcome a hearsay objection.101 In
Oregon, a statement is not hearsay if the statement is offered against a party and is that
party’s own statement. OEC 801 (4)(b)(A). A second common way that social media
may be admitted into evidence over hearsay objections is through the impeachment of a
witness.102 A third way to introduce social media is through any of the applicable
exceptions to the hearsay rule, such as excited utterance, present sense impression, and
the state of mind exceptions.103
IV.

Best evidence rule.

Although social media is typically obtained from a mirror image of a hard drive or a
screen shot of a web page, such copies of the original are admissible in courts.104
In Oregon, a duplicate of a writing or photograph is admissible to the same extent as an
original unless a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the original.
OEC 1003(1).

I.

Probative value must outweigh unfair prejudice.

Under Oregon law, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. OEC 403. Accordingly, the
probative value of social media evidence must be weighed against its potential prejudice
before being admitted in evidence. See also Josh Gilliland, The Admissibility of Social
Media Evidence, in American Bar Association, 39 Litigation Journal 1 (Winter 2013)
(noting that the court stuck allegations of a complaint related to a screenshot of a
MySpace page because it was prejudicial considering there was no evidence linking the
defendant to the profile page in Rice v. Reliastar Life Ins. Co., No., 2011 WL 1168520,
at *4 (M.D. La. Mar. 29, 2011)).
SOCIAL MEDIA ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
I.

Lawyers.

Some potential ethical pitfalls for attorneys to avoid when using social media include
unintentionally creating an attorney-client relationship or violating the rules of
professional conduct regarding solicitation or advertising.105 Attorneys should also be
aware that posting their own discussions about cases or others in the adversarial process
on social media could cause ethical issues.106 In addition, attorneys should avoid making
misrepresentations, for example, by requesting a continuance based on a reason that is
contrary to social media posts.107
Under ORPC 1.1, a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent
representation requires legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably
necessary for the representation. ORPC 1.1. This may require keeping up with the latest
social media trends and capabilities, such as geotagging, which permits someone to know
where a phone was active or where a picture was taken.108 And recognizing that
metadata associated with social media content should be requested because it could be
important to determining the actual author or poster to a social media site.109
Under ORPC 1.6, a lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a
client unless the client gives informed consent. Some attorneys may want to specify that
videotaped depositions are “confidential” or “attorney’s eyes only,” and may not be
posted on YouTube.110
A lawyer also has a duty to notify the sender of any inadvertently disclosed confidential
or privileged information.111 See also ORPC 404(b). If a client improperly gains access
to an opposing party’s social media content or accounts, the attorney’s remedies may be
advising client that the materials cannot be used or withdrawing from representation.112
II.

Jury selection.

Lawyers can learn important information about prospective jurors by examining their
educational and professional backgrounds on sites such as LinkedIn, or “likes” and
“dislikes” on sites such as Facebook.113 The America Bar Association issued an opinion
that restricted lawyers to searching only the public content of prospective jurors’ social
media accounts.114 It also prohibited lawyers from connecting with or following a juror
or potential juror under any circumstances.115 Lawyers should be aware that some social
media sites, such as LinkedIn, will alert a user when his or her profile and public content
have been viewed, which may also be considered inappropriate or unethical contact when
researching a potential jury pool or sitting juror.116

Page 9 of 13

III.

Jurors.

Jurors’ unauthorized use of social media has jeopardized cases and can result in a
mistrial.117 For example, jurors have used social media to comment about pending
trials.118 Jurors have also used social media to investigate the litigants and discover
information about the case.119
Given the potentially severe consequences, lawyers should monitor jurors’ use of social
media throughout the trial and deliberations.120 What if the lawyer becomes aware of a
juror’s improper use of social media by a juror who favors the lawyer’s client?121 The
ABA requires a lawyer who observes a juror’s misconduct in public social media posts to
report it to the court.122
CONCLUSION
“The relevance and uses to which social media postings, friend lists, or chat room
subjects and the like must be considered by every litigator in any kind of civil or criminal
case are limited only by one’s imagination and creativity.”123

Making “Them” Pay: Enforcing Judgments and Collecting on Fee Agreements

Introduction

For many parties (and for some lawyers), obtaining a favorable result at trial and the
judgment in their favor is the objective and goal, the end of a long, sometimes bitter
race. A better metaphor, however, may be that the favorable result and judgment are
the summit of a mountain. It is the culmination of a tremendous amount of time and
effort, but, as Ed Viesturs is fond of remarking, the summit is only the halfway mark of a
successful mountain ascent. Enforcement options and collection potential should have
been assessed and reviewed as part of the underlying dispute, potentially even before
any lawsuit was filed; at the same time, your clients should fully understand their
financial responsibility. In a perfect world, judgment-debtors would quickly tender full
payment of the judgment entered against them and clients pay each invoice, in full and
on time. However, many judgment-debtors and clients are unable or unwilling to make
payment of the outstanding obligations. Once the judgment-debtor or client has failed
to pay, it is time to begin the descent.
II.

Collecting Your Clients' Claims
Establishing Your Clients' Claims

A.

In the Bankruptcy Code, a “claim” is a right to payment or equitable remedy from the
debtor. It encompasses the simplest debts (“money had and received”) to the most
complex (a corporation’s obligation to fund clean-up activities for environmental
damage) and includes the right to an equitable remedy. This expansive definition, along
with the legislative history, demonstrates that “claim” encompasses many different
forms of obligations. See, e.g., In re Energy Corp., 944 F.2d 589, 595 (9th Cir. 1991).
Likewise, your client’s claims include all the obligations owed to the client,
whether it be the obligation to share family photos for duplication, the obligation to
transfers real property, or the obligation to pay an equalizing judgment. The judgment
should clearly specify what your client is receiving with respect to each and every claim.
1.

Division of Property vs. Money Award
a.
Transfer of Ownership

There is an important distinction between the court’s exercise of its power to
provide for the “division or other disposition between the parties of the real or personal
property” (under ORS 107.105) and its awarding of a money award against a party. It
may be a distinction without a difference in many situations, but it can truly matter. As
discussed below, to the extent that the judgment provides for the transfer or
conveyance of ownership, the judgment is self-executing. “A judgment requiring a party
to make a conveyance, transfer, release, acquittance, or other like act within a period

therein specified shall, if such party does not comply with the judgment, be deemed to
be equivalent thereto.” ORCP 78A.
For example, if a spouse was determined to be entitled to one-quarter of the
other spouse’s single-member limited liability company valued at $100,000, the division
of this property could be accomplished by either a money award (for $25,000) or
transfer of one-quarter of the limited liability company. If the spouse held a money
award, the spouse could pursue collection against any of the spouses’ assets (including
the limited liability company), but would have no additional rights vis-à-vis the limited
liability company; if the spouse was awarded the interest in the entity, the spouse would
be a one-quarter owner and subject to the whims of the majority owner, the former
spouse, but would have minority rights in the company as an owner (rather than a
creditor of the debtor-spouse).
In most cases, it is necessary to take further actions to effectuate the transfer.
For example, if the judgment creditor is awarded fee simple ownership of Blackacre, the
simplest method to effectuate the transfer is for the judgment debtor to execute a simple
quitclaim deed and have the same recorded. If the judgment debtor is unwilling or
unable to cooperate, however, the entire dissolution judgment may be recorded to make
public the same transfer.
The judgment can only transfer what the judgment debtor possesses. If the
judgment debtor’s interest is subject to encumbrances, then the interest transferred is
likewise subject to encumbrances. Hoyt v. American Traders, Inc., 301 Ore. 599, 725
P.2d 336 (Or. 1986). This underscores the importance of recording a notice of
pendency when the initial complaint is filed – the notice can be filed to preserve the
judgment creditor’s priority while the dissolution action proceeds. ORS 107.085(5). The
Notice of Pendency should be recorded in county where the real property is located
(rather than where the action is pending). ORS 93.740.
b.

QDROs

For bankruptcy purposes, the right to obtain a Qualified Domestic Relations
Order is functionally equivalent to the Qualified Domestic Relations Order for purposes
of establishing an adverse interest in the pension plan: an “interest in the pension plans
(or, at a minimum, her right to obtain a QDRO which would in turn give her an interest in
the plans) was established under state law at the time of the divorce decree.”
Gendreau v. Gendreau (In re Gendreau), 122 F.3d 815, 818 (9th Cir. 1997). This is
consistent with the idea of the transfer having divested the other spouse of their interest.
If the judgment-debtor is divested of an interest in an ERISA-qualified benefit plan, the
judgment is self-executing and the judgment creditor has the right to obtain a QDRO to
make public and confirm the transfer (e.g. with the Plan Administrator complying with
the terms of the QDRO to show the judgment creditor as the payee or beneficiary).
It should be noted that Gendreau has not been affirmed or limited on the issue of
whether the “interest in the pension plans” transferred is exemptible property. The
general rule is that exemptions are broadly construed in favor of the debtor. Mullen v.
Hamlin (In re Hamlin), 465 B.R. 863, 869 (9th Cir. BAP 2012) (“Exemptions are to be
liberally construed in favor of the debtor who claims the exemption." citing Arrol v.

Broach (In re Arrol), 170 F.3d 934, 937 (9th Cir.1999)). However, to qualify for the
generous exemptions for retirement accounts, there is, at least, a question of whether
the judgment creditor’s interest in the plan qualifies the judgment creditor as a
“Beneficiary” under ORS 18.358. For this reason, the general practice is to avoid the
potential issue until the plan administrator has accepted the QDRO.
c.

Money Awards and Security

The collection of a money award is subject to the exemptions provided under
state law (and, in bankruptcy, federal law, if claimed). While practice has shifted from
reliance on the judicial lien to secure the equalizing judgment after one spouse received
the entire marital residence, it should be noted that the usual homestead exemption
analysis (e.g. homestead exemption after consensual liens and before judicial liens)
does not apply, at least in bankruptcy proceedings. Farrey v. Sanderfoot, 500 U.S. 291
(1991). Faced with the scenario where Sanderfoot received the entire marital residence
subject to a lien in favor of Farrey (who lost her interest in the property) and then sought
to avoid Farrey’s lien as impairing his homestead exemption, the Supreme Court looked
at Section 522 to craft a way around this apparent inequity. The underlying rationale of
Sanderfoot is that Farrey took the property subject to the lien and thus, the lien existed
prior to the homestead exemption and could not impair it. Whether this same rationale
would prevail under ORS 18.412 remains to be seen as there are no reported decisions
regarding ORS 18.412 (nor its predecessor, ORS 23.280) as applied against a judicial
lien to secure the equalizing judgment after one spouse received the entire marital
residence.
Additional security for money awards is infinitely malleable. In a stipulated
agreement, judgment creditor and judgment debtor can agree to any arrangement that
is mutually agreeable and, if the parties are cooperating, may be able to obtain thirdparty participation to provide further assurances of payment. See, e.g., In re Marriage
of Waker and Waker, 114 Ore. App. 255, 834 P.2d 522, (Or. Ct. App. 1992) (finding that
court-ordered security against judgment debtor’s interest in corporation did not compel
guarantee by other shareholders where such guarantee would be obtained by
shareholder sale agreement). Court-ordered security may be more limited, but is still
driven by imagination of the judgment creditor and the willingness of the court.
In either scenario, however, the value of the security is best measured by its
usefulness in collecting the underlying money award.

2.

Domestic Support Obligation vs. Property Settlement

The choice of chapter along with the classification of a particular debt (either as a
Domestic Support Obligation (“DSO”), a Property Settlement, or “other”) determines its
treatment in the bankruptcy. “As a matter of public policy, an agreement in advance of
a bankruptcy case that a particular claim is not subject to discharge is not enforceable.”
In re Jennings, 306 B.R. 672, 675 (Bankr. D. Or. 2004) (citing In re Huang, 275 F.3d
1173, 1176 (9th Cir. 2002), Hayhoe v. Cole, 226 B.R. 647, 651-54 (BAP 9th Cir. 1988)).
Among other reasons, this means that bare statements that debts are either non-

dischargeable or classified as a particular type of debt are generally non-binding on the
bankruptcy court.
Broadly speaking, DSOs includes debts that are in the nature of alimony,
maintenance, or support and, generally, includes attorney fees awarded that were
directly related to these obligations. A DSO is now defined as a debt that is:
1.
“[O]wed to or recoverable by — . . . a spouse, former
spouse, or child of debtor or such child’s parent, legal
guardian, or responsible relative . . . or a governmental unit”;
2.
“[I]n the nature of alimony, maintenance or support . .
. of such spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor or
such child’s parent, without regard to whether such debt is
expressly so designated”; and
3.
“[E]stablished . . . by reason of applicable provisions
of — . . . a separation agreement, divorce decree, or
property settlement agreement; . . . an order of a court of
record”; or an administrative determination.
11 U.S.C. § 101(14A)(A)–(C). Attempts to label property settlements as alimony (to
avoid discharge in bankruptcy) and alimony as property settlements (to avoid taxation
by the recipient) may or may not be effective. The bankruptcy court is generally willing
to look at the actual purpose of the award and discern whether it is in the nature of
support or maintenance or is actually property settlement; “the court must look beyond
the language of the decree to the intent of the parties and substance of the obligation.”
Shaver v. Shaver, 736 F.2d 1314 (9th Cir. 1984). Three recent cases from the
bankruptcy court have each held the mere statement in a stipulated divorce decree that
an obligation is "support" is not enough to make the obligation a priority "domestic
support obligation" in bankruptcy. In re Nelson, 451 B.R. 918 (Bankr. D. Or. 2011); In re
Thorud, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 4119, 2011 WL 5079506 (Bankr. D. Or. Oct. 26, 2011); In
re Morgan, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 1519, 2011 WL 1598065 (Bankr. D. Or. Apr. 26, 2011).
The appropriate standard for determination of whether an obligation is a Domestic
Support Obligation is a consideration of multiple factors:
Factors to be considered in determining the intent of the parties include “whether
the recipient spouse actually needed spousal support at the time of the divorce[,]” which
requires looking at whether there was an "imbalance in the relative income of the
parties" at the time of the divorce. Other considerations are whether the obligation
terminates on the death or remarriage of the recipient spouse, and whether payments
are made directly to the spouse in installments over a substantial period of time. The
labels the parties used for the payments may also provide evidence of the parties'
intent. In re Nelson, 451 B.R. at 921-22 (internal citations omitted) (citing to In re
Sternberg, 85 F.3d 1400, 1405 (9th Cir. 1996) and Shaver v. Shaver, 736 F.2d 1314,
1316-17 (9th Cir. 1984)). Nelson should be contrasted with In re Maitlen, wherein the
7th Circuit determined the obligation of a debtor to pay a mortgage on the ex-spouse’s
home was in the nature of support because the payment was designed to provide
support for the ex-spouse. Maitlen, 658 F.2d 466 (7th Cir. 1981).

If a debt to a spouse, former spouse, or child is not of the kind described as a
DSO, then it may be of the type referred to in Section 523(a)(15) (generally referred to
as a “property settlement”). These debts are owed a spouse, former spouse, or child,
not of the kind described as a DSO and incurred by the debtor in the course of a divorce
or separation or in connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree or other
order. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15). This definition encompasses the classic property
settlement where one party receives property of the marital estate in exchange for a
payment of a sum of money to the other spouse.
If the obligation is neither a DSO nor a property settlement (i.e. an agreement to
pay a joint debt), the debt is generally going to be a general unsecured obligation and
likely dischargeable.
DSOs are never dischargeable in bankruptcy. In Chapter 7, DSOs are entitled to
priority over nearly all creditors to receive non-exempt property of the estate. In
Chapter 13, DSO arrears must be paid in full during the duration of the plan, current
payments must be maintained during Chapter 13, and any post-petition arrears are
grounds for dismissal of the Chapter 13 case.
Property settlements, however, are treated quite differently. The balancing test
(basically, which party was poorer) previously used under Section 523(a)(15) to
determine if some obligations not related to alimony, maintenance, or support were
dischargeable in Chapter 7 has been eliminated. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15). Obligations
under 523(a)(15) are nondischargeable in Chapter 7 and in a Chapter 13 “hardship”
discharge under Section 1328(b). Such debts are dischargeable in a Chapter 13 in
which a debtor receives a normal discharge under Section 1328(a). As a result, a client
who accepts a larger property settlement instead of a domestic support obligation can
be significantly disadvantaged if the former spouse files a Chapter 13 bankruptcy,
confirms their plan, completes their proposed plan (which will treat the property
settlement as a general unsecured obligation), and receives their discharge.
Finally, a debt may be owed to a spouse, former spouse, or child which is neither
a DSO nor a property settlement (as defined above). For example, John and Jane are
a married couple; both are liable to Bank on an unsecured line of credit. If, prior to a
dissolution, John were to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, he would be able to discharge his
obligation to Bank and his obligation to Jane (for contribution). Then, going into a
dissolution, Jane would be the only party liable on the unsecured line of credit. If John
and Jane had first been through a dissolution, the divorce decree could assign liability to
either party (or both). Assume John was to indemnify Jane, then, going into a
bankruptcy, while John could discharge his obligation to the Bank, the obligation to Jane
would be nondischargeable in his Chapter 7 as a property settlement under Section
523(a)(15) (but would be dischargeable if John had instead filed under Chapter 13 (11
U.S.C. § 1328(a)). For John, the change in timing of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing
eliminates some or all of the benefit of a bankruptcy as to the Bank obligation (i.e. the
Bank can pursue collection against Jane who can then collect from John).
If a property settlement has not been entered at the time of case filing, it cannot
be discharged in bankruptcy. To be a pre-petition obligation, the property settlement
must arise before the filing of the bankruptcy case. See, e.g., Arleaux v. Arleaux, 210

B.R. 148 (8th Cir. 1997); In re Miller, 246 B.R. 559 (E.D. Tenn. 2000); In re Berlingeri,
246 B.R. 196 (N.J. 2000); In re Gomez, 206 B.R. 663 (E.D.N.Y. 1997) (cases in a
dissolution proceeding was filed and, prior to a property settlement judgment, a
bankruptcy was filed).
If the property settlement is entered prior to the bankruptcy being filed (and
regardless of whether the dissolution proceeding has completed), in some jurisdictions it
may be considered to be a pre-petition debt and may be dischargeable (in Chapter 13
only). See, e.g., In re Rudy, 2005 Bankr. LEXIS 2834 (E.D.Va. 2005) (a property
settlement entered in a dissolution, which was still on-going as to other issues, was
dischargeable in bankruptcy filed after settlement entered). Finally, a property
settlement stipulation which was read into the record but not yet entered into a judgment
was held to be dischargeable. In re Anjum, 288 B.R. 72 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).
What about obligations that arise post-bankruptcy but pre-plan confirmation in
Chapter 13? Unlike the discharge in Chapter 7, which discharges "all debts that arose
before the date of the order for relief," Chapter 13 discharges "all debts provided for by
the plan." 11 U.S.C. §§ 727, 1328. A debtor may not provide for a post-petition debt
that is not the subject of a properly filed and allowed post-petition proof of claim absent
creditor consent. E.g. In re Laymon, 360 B.R. 902 (E.D. Ark. 2007). Narrow exceptions
are found in Section 1305 for some post-petition taxes and specific consumer debts.
Those consumer debts are limited to those necessary for debtor's performance under
the plan and for which prior approval could not be sought. In addition, a post-petition
claim must be voluntarily filed by the entity holding the claim. In re Cleveland, 349 B.R.
522 (E.D. Tenn. 2006) (citing 8 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY 1322.10 (5th Ed. Rev. 2005)).
Since a property settlement would not fit within either category of Section 1305 claims, it
would not be possible for a bankruptcy plan to provide for a post-petition obligation that
arises under a divorce decree.
The distinctions between types of claims and each's treatment in bankruptcy can
be significantly affected by many factors, including the timing of a bankruptcy.
Determining the timing of a bankruptcy in relationship to a dissolution is generally fact
specific and must be determined in light of the client's overall objectives.
B.

Enforcing Your Clients' Money Award(s)

Once the favorable result at trial has been obtained, it is now time to engage in the
collections process to satisfy that result. In a perfect world, your judgment-debtors will
quickly tender full payment of the judgment entered against them. However, many
judgment-debtors are unable or unwilling to make payment of the outstanding
obligation. Once judgment has been entered and the judgment-debtor has failed to pay,
it is time to begin this next phase.
In doing so, however, practitioners should not forget that judgment enforcement
is just another step in the dispute between the parties – judgment enforcement should
be undertaken in light of the client’s objectives. Broadly speaking, there are two
philosophical approaches: enforcement as a collection mechanism and enforcement as
inducement to payment.

Viewing judgment enforcement as a collection mechanism starts with the
premise that the purpose of the collection mechanisms is to collect on the judgment. It
generally relies on the assumption that the judgment-debtor is able but unwilling to pay
the underlying obligation. A judgment debtor may be unwilling to pay for many reasons:
a bona fide dispute with the judgment, continued animosity against the judgment
creditor, or simply indignation that the debtor is being required to pay the creditor. As a
result, the various options available to the judgment creditor are employed to seize
payment from the judgment debtor. Such involuntary collection rarely reduces
animosity or indignation and can lead to further disputes and, even where there is not
non-compliance with the terms of a judgment, rigid compliance and enforcement, with
allegations and complaints stemming from variations which should be ignored by both
parties. On the other hand, such enforcement may be the only option available to a
judgment creditor.
Viewing judgment enforcement as an inducement to payment may be a subtle
shift in perspective, but, ultimately, it may be more effective. While the judgment
creditor may use the same tools, the ultimate goal is not to extract the maximum
repayment from each use, but is to convince the judgment debtor that a mutually
agreeable payment arrangement is in everyone’s interest. Even if collection is slower,
the reduction in tensions along with the regularity of payment (and the reduction in time
and effort required to obtain it) may make this philosophy more appropriate in some
situations. That said, some judgment debtors are chronically unable to meet their
obligations.
The taxing authorities, the Oregon Department of Revenue and the Internal
Revenue Services, have each chosen one of these philosophies. The Oregon
Department of Revenue’s collection cycle proceeds quickly from a demand to
garnishment of wages and accounts. Once a garnishment is established, ODR
generally does not release the garnishment until the underlying liability has been
satisfied (or the garnishment expires). In several cases, ODR’s unwillingness to release
a garnishment or work with a client has been the final inducement for a client to file a
bankruptcy and eliminate (or restructure) that payment obligation. The Internal
Revenue Service, on the other hand, issues a series of increasingly urgent notices and
provides information about the alternatives to involuntary collection. If the IRS issues a
levy on wages (their equivalent of wage garnishment), it is draconian: IRS levies take all
funds except for a minimum amount each pay period. However, the IRS will enter into
payment arrangements substantially reducing the payments and release the levy. In
many cases, the levy will be released pending the establishment of an installment
agreement. While the taxing authorities have less flexibility to change their approach for
individual debtors, choosing the most appropriate method for collection is a choice that
should be made deliberately.
1.

What You Already Have

Once the judgment has been entered (and is not subject to a stay pending
appeal), the judgment creditor’s position is immediately improved. Before starting out
into collections, the judgment creditor may wish to review what has already been
gained.

First, the judgment is immediately enforceable unless there has been a stay of
proceedings to enforce the judgment: “Execution or other proceeding to enforce a
judgment may issue immediately upon the entry of the judgment, unless the court ...
otherwise directs.” ORCP 72A.
Second, some aspects of the judgment may be self-executing: “A judgment
requiring a party to make a conveyance, transfer, release, acquittance, or other like act
within a period therein specified shall, if such party does not comply with the judgment,
be deemed to be equivalent thereto.” ORCP 78A. While completing this transfer may
require additional actions (e.g. recording the judgment to effect a transfer of real
property or further court orders to direct third parties), the self-executing nature of the
transfer underscores the distinction between the award of ownership of a thing and a
money award for its value.
Third, so long as the judgment contains a money award, the judgment creates a
judicial lien attaching to all real property of the judgment debtor in the county (both
presently owned and afterwards acquired). ORS 18.150(2).
As a result, immediately after the entry of judgment, judgment creditors have all
of the enforced collection options at their disposal, the automatic transfer of property,
and a lien on all real property interests of the judgment debtor located in the county.
The money award also begins to accrue interest at nine percent (9%). ORS 82.010(2).
The judgment creditor with either an excellent collateral basis or a strong collection
potential may choose to consider the money award as an appreciating asset, albeit one
subject to risk.
2.

Making Demand

Demand for payment of a judgment is not required (except for prior to scheduling
a Judgment Debtor Examination (described below)). Whether demand should be made
is a strategic decision. If the goal is to induce compliance, a demand for payment
(perhaps coupled with options for payment over time) can be a starting point for an
amicable payment arrangement and schedule. It can also be the starting point for the
friendly disclosure of financial information. Alternatively, if the goal is collection, a
demand for payment can warn the judgment debtor to drain bank accounts, shelter or
transfer assets, and otherwise make collection difficult.
3.

Obtaining Information about Assets

In order to effectively collect on a judgment, information is required. Much of that
information may already be in the judgment creditor’s possession (or their attorney).
During the process of the dissolution, the same documentation that was used to
demonstrate the appropriate division of marital property and to determine the
appropriate amounts, if any, of any domestic support obligations can be used to assess
the collection potential of the resulting judgment. Likewise, the judgment debtor should
know that the judgment creditor is already in possession of all of this information.
As time passes, however, that information becomes increasingly stale. In
addition, a judgment debtor may change their financial habits and arrangements in ways
that make collection more difficult.

a.

Judgment Debtor Examination / Financial Statements

After judgment, the judgment creditor’s ability to obtain information from the
debtor is substantially increased.
First, the judgment creditor against the ability to serve the judgment debtor with
written interrogatories concerning assets and financial affairs. Once served on the
judgment debtor, the debtor must answer questions, under oath, within 20 days and
return the original interrogatories. ORS 18.270. If the judgment debtor fails to comply,
the debtor may be held in contempt if the judgment creditor goes forward with a motion
for an order to show cause. The various Circuit Courts have different policies with
respect to the consequences of contempt, especially with respect to civil judgment
collection. There is a practicality to written interrogatories: they do not require the time
and travel of a judgment debtor examination and, as the judgment debtor has a greater
period of time to answer the question, the judgment debtor may provide more accurate
information. Unfortunately, judgment debtors frequently fail to provide the full and
complete disclosure desired and the format does not provide a good method to follow
up on incomplete responses (requiring either further interrogatories or supplemental
proceedings).
Second, the judgment creditor may conduct a Judgment Debtor Examination
(“JDE”) by obtaining an order requiring the appearance of the judgment debtor to
“answer under oath questions concerning any property or interest in property that the
judgment debtor may have or claim.” ORS 18.265. To obtain a JDE, the judgment
creditor must demonstrate some prior effort to collect the judgment: (1) proof of service
of a notice of demand to pay the judgment within 10 days, (2) a return of a writ of
execution that does not fully satisfy the judgment, or (3) a garnishee response that does
not fully satisfy the judgment. Id. Importantly, as part of the JDE order, the court may
also restrain the debtor from “selling, transferring or in any manner disposing of any
property of the judgment debtor that is subject to execution pending an examination
under this section.” ORS 18.265(7). In addition, the JDE order can also require the
debtor to bring relevant documents.
With the JDE having been scheduled, the judgment creditor is permitted to
prepare for that examination through use of discovery and subpoenas, including
obtaining information from third-parties (discussed below). In some cases, the
scheduled JDE is ancillary to gaining the ability to obtain third-party documentation.
Once a JDE is sought and scheduled, if the primary purpose is the examination
of the debtor, it is common for it to be rescheduled or even cancelled.
First, while the JDE is usually scheduled to occur at a courthouse, it is not
uncommon for the time and place of the JDE to be rescheduled to counsel’s offices or
another location. While the judgment creditor may lose the ability to immediately obtain
an order for the debtor to turn over property, the properly counseled judgment debtor
will not have such property in their possession.
Second, in some cases, the judgment debtor has been without counsel since the
completion of the litigation and may have been less than diligent in responding to prior

requests and demands for information. Having a scheduled court appearance
convinces many judgment debtors to obtain counsel to address the new proceeding. If
the judgment creditor is seeking information, the judgment debtor may be able to avoid
the JDE by providing a financial statement (or completing the judgment creditor’s form
financial statement). In this model, the JDE provides the incentive to provide timely
information and avoid further delays and costs.
If the JDE is going forward, the judgment debtor may seek a protective order to
change the time and place of the JDE. ORS 18.265(6). The judgment debtor may also
seek protective orders as to the extent of the JDE; for example, in a long-running
dispute, the judgment debtor may obtain a protective order limiting the ability of the
judgment creditor to re-hash previously covered topics. For example, in a case where
the judgment debtor produced approximately 2,000 pages of records and was deposed
for five hours, a subsequent JDE sought the following year was limited in scope to
developments in the judgment debtor’s financial affairs since the prior examination.
At the JDE, the use of a court reporter is optional. The use of a court reporter will
increase the costs of the examination, but will create a transcript which could be used
later. It may also affect the conduct of the parties and their counsel. Alternatively,
“unofficial” recording may be more appropriate, but may not available in the courthouse
and may be only used with consent or court order outside of it. ORCP 39C(4).
b.

Third Party Sources

Just as for trial, third-party information can be the most reliable information – who
better to tell you the judgment debtor’s banking details than the bank? Obtaining that
information, however, can be difficult without utilizing formal discovery processes.
Non-discovery methods can be used to ascertain what assets may be available
for collection:
(1)
Secretary of State – Business Division: Searches can reveal interests in
companies, corporations, and partnerships.
(2)
Secretary of State – UCC Division: Searches can reveal both the
judgment debtor as the secured party (e.g. they are owed money) or as the debtor (e.g.
they hold potentially valuable collateral).
(3)
planes.

Vehicle Registries: Searches can reveal ownership of cars, boats, and

(4)
property.

Real Property Records: Searches can reveal ownership interests in real

Once a JDE has been scheduled (see above), the judgment creditor is not limited
to pursuing discovery against the judgment debtor; third party sources can subpoenaed
to either appear at the JDE to give testimony or to produce documentation. Utilizing
both garnishment and subpoena powers, the judgment creditor can seize/freeze what is
held by the third party (via garnishment) and obtain documentation regarding what had
been held by the third party and its disposition (via subpoena). For example, a
garnishment and subpoena for production of documents seeking the last year of

relevant records served simultaneously on a financial situation could seize the current
balance and alert the judgment creditor that amounts were deposited into the account
from a source and/or amounts were transferred from the account to another financial
institution.
4.

Execution Against Assets

Once the judgment-debtor has failed to respond to the demand(s) for payment
and you’ve obtained information about the financial affairs of the judgment-debtor, the
next step is embarking on one or more forms of involuntary collection activities (e.g.
wage garnishment, account garnishment, seizure and sale of assets, and foreclosure of
real property).
a.

Financial Accounts and Wages: Garnishment

Garnishment is the form of execution used against property of a debtor not in
their possession. ORS 18.602 (“[G]arnishment is the procedure by which a creditor
invokes the authority of a circuit court, justice court or municipal court to acquire
garnishable property of a debtor that is in the possession, control or custody of a person
other than the debtor.”) Garnishment is the most common form of involuntary collection
tool and is routinely used by various creditors. Given its broad reach and frequent
usage, the garnishment procedures and forms are statutory in nature.
To serve a garnishment, the judgment creditor (“garnishor”) delivers the writ of
garnishment (form provided by ORS 18.830), garnishee response (form provided by
ORS 18.835), instructions-to-garnishee (form provided by ORS 18.838), wage
exemption calculation (form provided by ORS 18.840), and, if applicable, the search fee
to the third party (“garnishee”). After delivery of the above to the garnishee, the
garnishor must deliver a copy of the writ of garnishment, an original debt calculation
(form provided by ORS 18.832), a challenge-to-garnishment form (form provided by
ORS 18.845, and a notice-of-exemptions form (form provided by 18.850) to the
judgment debtor.
For all property other than wages, the writ of garnishment garnishes “all property
of the debtor possessed by the garnishee, all property of the debtor over which the
garnishee has control and all property of the debtor that is in the custody of the
garnishee” at the time the writ is delivered. ORS 18.615, 18.625. This “one-shot”
garnishment seizes property in the garnishee’s possession at the instant of delivery; if
the debtor’s bank account is empty on the Tuesday the writ is received, that is all the
garnishor is able to seize, even if the following day, exorbitant sums of money are
transferred into the account.
For wages, the writ of garnishment grabs both wages owed at the time of delivery
and all wages owed in the following 90 days (unless the writ of garnishment is satisfied
or released). ORS 18.625. Garnished wages are paid to the garnishor concurrently
with the garnishee’s payment of the exempt wages to the debtor.
b.

Real Property: Liens and Foreclosure

From entry, the judgment creates a judicial lien attaching to all real property of
the judgment debtor in the county (both presently owned and afterwards acquired).
ORS 18.150(2). If the debtor owns real property in another county, it is necessary to
record the judgment lien on that property by recording a certified copy of the judgment
(or a lien record abstract) in the County Clerk Lien Record for the county where the
property is located. ORS 18.152. If that real property is located in another state, it will
need to be registered in the foreign state; while most states have adopted the Uniform
Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Acts, not all states have done so uniformly and
several status (most relevantly, California) have not adopted it at all.
Recording or registering a judgment is simple matter which secured the judgment
against real property. Even if no other action is taken, the existence of the judgment
lien will require the judgment debtor to address the outstanding judgment in order to sell
or refinance the real property.
Foreclosing on this judgment is a more complicated procedure. If the real
property is “residential real property” (defined in ORS 18.904 to include real property
with four or fewer dwellings, a condominium unit not held as inventory for sale or lease,
a manufactured dwelling not held as inventory for sale or lease, or a floating home not
held for sale or release), foreclosure of the judgment lien will require a court order.
c.

Tangible Personal Property: Seizure and Sale

Generally, a judgment does not create a lien on personal property until a writ of
execution has been issued and the sheriff has levied on the personal property; however,
the exception is that a judgment for unpaid child or spousal support creates a lien on the
judgment debtor’s personal property. ORS 25.670. Utilizing similar procedures to a
judicial foreclosure, the judgment creditor can also have the sheriff seize or secure
personal property and conduct a sale of that property. Since the sheriff will need to
either store or secure the personal property, an additional deposit will generally be
required for towing, storage and other necessary expenses. It’s generally advisable to
consult with the sheriff’s office regarding the necessary deposit(s) prior to issuance of
the writ of execution.
d.

Intangible Personal Property: Seizure and Sale (Partnership and
LLC Interests)

The sale of partnership and limited liability company interests may differ from the
sale of other personal property. For partnerships and certain LLC interests, the
applicable entity Acts may limit the remedies of the judgment creditor to seize or
execute upon the judgment debtors interests.
For partnerships, the law is most clear cut: the sole remedy for a judgment
creditor against a debtor’s partnership interest is a charging order. ORS 67.205(5).
This means that the judgment creditor cannot obtain the judgment debtor’s interest in
the partnership; generally, this limitation is driven by the concerns for the judgment
debtor’s partners, who did not choose to enter into a partnership with the judgment
creditor. Instead of obtaining the judgment debtor’s partnership interest, the Oregon
Revised Partnership Act ("ORPA") provides that "[o]n application by a judgment creditor

of a partner or of a partner's transferee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the
transferable interest of the judgment debtor to satisfy the judgment." ORS 67.205(1). A
partner's transferable interests consist of the partner's right to receive distributions and
the partner's share of the profit or losses of the partnership. ORS 67.195. In Hellman v.
Anderson, the Court of Appeal of California held that only the judgment-debtor partner’s
share of profits and surplus, and not the right to management or rights in partnership
property, is subject to the claim of a judgment creditor of one of the partners. 233 Cal.
App. 3d 840, 852, 284 Cal Rptr. 830 (1991). California’s statute on charging orders is
nearly identical to provisions in the ORPA. Compare Cal. Corp. Code § 16504 with ORS
67.205.
For limited liability companies, the law is murkier. Under the Oregon Limited
Liability Company Act ("OLLCA"), a judgment creditor may obtain a charging order to
acquire "only the rights of an assignee of the membership interest." ORS 63.259. The
assignee of a membership interest holds "right to receive and retain, to the extent
assigned, the distributions, as and when made, and allocations of profits and losses to
which the assignor would be entitled." ORS 63.249(3). However, an assignee "shall not
exercise any other rights of a member, including without limitation the right to vote or
otherwise participate in the management and affairs of the limited liability company." Id.
Thus far, collection against a limited liability company is much the same as for a
partnership; however, unlike ORS 67.205 (allowing charging orders against partnership
interests), ORS 63.259 does not contain a provision that makes a charging order the
"exclusive remedy" available to a judgment creditor. Courts have made inconsistent
rulings with no overall philosophy.
For the multimember LLC interest (and absent other factors), treatment akin to a
partnership would appear to be the better decision. In order to exercise all of rights
attendant to a membership interest in a limited liability company ("LLC"), an assignee
must be made a member of the LLC. When the LLC is a multi-member LLC, as
opposed to a single member LLC, an assignee must have the consent of a majority of
the LLC members, other than the assignor. ORS 63.245(b), (c). The purpose of these
restrictions is to ensure that LLCs have a defined existence as a single entity while
providing protection from individual member’s creditors and partnership tax treatment.
See generally SYMPOSIUM ON OREGON'S LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY ACT: FINANCIAL
ASPECTS OF OREGON LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES, 73 Or. L. Rev. 55, 82-5 (Spring 1994)
(explaining the impact of transfers of LLC membership interests and the impact of free
transferability for tax purposes). As explained by the court in In re Albright, the charging
order “exists to protect other members of an LLC from having involuntarily to share
governance responsibilities with someone they did not choose, or from having to accept
a creditor of another member as a co-manager.” 291 B.R. 538, 541 (Bankr. D. Colo.
2003).
For the single-member LLC (and absent other factors), treatment as a personal
asset would appear to be the better decision. The policy concerns regarding
involuntarily sharing governance are no present in a single-member LLC.
Ultimately, the balance will depend on the judgment debtor’s presentation in the
objection to the sale of the LLC membership interest -- to the extent that the sale of the

LLC interest would force other members of the LLC to involuntarily share governance, a
charging order may be more appropriate. The individual structure and operating
agreement of the LLC become highly relevant – for example, a member-managed LLC
is more likely to have involuntary governance concerns than an LLC more closely
operated like a corporation.

Bankruptcy "Short Course"
The Automatic Stay

Immediately upon filing of any bankruptcy petition, whether voluntary or
involuntary, an automatic injunction goes into effect, which prevents most creditor
actions against the debtor and the property of the estate. See 11 U.S.C. § 362. The list
of actions barred by the automatic stay is extensive:
(1) the commencement or continuation, including the
issuance or employment of process, of a judicial,
administrative, or other action or proceeding against the
debtor that was or could have been commenced before the
commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a
claim against the debtor that arose before the
commencement of the case under this title;
(2) the enforcement, against the debtor or against property
of the estate, of a judgment obtained before the
commencement of the case under this title;
(3) any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or
of property from the estate or to exercise control over
property of the estate;
(4) any act to create, perfect, or enforce any lien against
property of the estate;
(5) any act to create, perfect, or enforce against property of
the debtor any lien to the extent that such lien secures a
claim that arose before the commencement of the case
under this title;
(6) any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the
debtor that arose before the commencement of the case
under this title;
(7) the setoff of any debt owing to the debtor that arose
before the commencement of the case under this title
against any claim against the debtor; and
(8) the commencement or continuation of a proceeding
before the United States Tax Court concerning a corporate
debtor’s tax liability for a taxable period the bankruptcy court
may determine or concerning the tax liability of a debtor who

is an individual for a taxable period ending before the date of
the order for relief under this title.
11 U.S.C. § 362(a). The automatic stay is broad in scope and covers virtually all acts to
collect pre-petition claims and all actions which would affect property of the estate.
The purpose of the automatic stay is two-fold. First, it provides the debtor with
relief from the pressure of collection efforts by their creditors and protects the debtor’s
property. Second, it promotes bankruptcy’s goals of equality of distribution; instead of a
race to obtain the debtor’s non-exempt property, the automatic stay halts creditor
collection efforts to allow the bankruptcy trustee to marshal the non-exempt assets and
disburse them in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code. Actions taken in violation of
the automatic stay have no effect. “[A]ctions taken in violation of the automatic stay are
void.” Gruntz v. Los Angeles (In re Gruntz), 202 F.3d 1074, (9th Cir. 2000). For
example, a judgment obtained in violation of the automatic stay is void. Even if a matter
is mid-trial, the automatic stay halts all the proceedings. “Judicial proceedings in
violation of th[e] automatic stay are void." Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co. v. Shamblin
(In re Shamblin), 890 F.2d 123, 125 (9th Cir. 1989).
The bankruptcy debtor provides a list of creditors, each of whom receives a
Notice of Case Filing by mail. The automatic stay of 11 U.S.C. § 362(a) nearly always
protects the debtor no matter what type of bankruptcy is filed, except in certain specific
instances. In addition, Chapter 13 also includes a co-debtor stay. 11 U.S.C. § 1301.
Under the co-debtor stay, a person who is co-obligated with a debtor on a consumer
obligation is also protected from creditor action. Where the automatic stay is the
“breathing room” for the debtor, the discharge is the relief ultimately sought by the
debtor. When the debtor obtains their discharge, the automatic stay is replaced by a
permanent injunction which prohibits creditors from those same actions with respect to
discharged debts.
Practice Tip: The U.S. Party/Case Index is a national index for U.S. district,
bankruptcy, and appellate courts’ CM/ECF (Case Management / Electronic Case Files)
information. A small subset of information from each case is transferred to the U.S.
Party/Case Index server each night located in San Antonio, Texas at the PACER
(Public Access to Court Electronic Records) Service Center. The system serves as a
locator index for PACER. You may conduct nationwide searches to determine whether
or not a party is involved in federal litigation. If you are unsure a debtor has filed for
bankruptcy, you can use the U.S. Party/Case Index to determine whether or a petition
has been filed.
a.

Exceptions to the Automatic Stay

While the automatic stay gives the debtor a respite from many creditors, there
are a few exceptions to the automatic stay. 11 U.S.C. § 362(b). Just as the scope of
the automatic stay is expansive, exceptions to the automatic stay are read narrowly.
Treasurer of Snohomish Co. v. Seattle First Nat. Bank (In re Glasply Marine Industries,
Inc.), 971 F.2d 391, 394 95 (9th Cir. 1992). Creditors should carefully evaluate whether
their particular situation falls within one of the Section 362(b) exceptions; since the
penalties for violation of the automatic stay can be quite severe, caution is advised.

Some of the more common exceptions are for the commencement or
continuation of criminal actions, some family law actions, collection of domestic support
obligations, and (new from the changes in BAPCPA) some eviction proceedings. 11
U.S.C. § 362(b)(1), (2), (22)-(23). While family law practitioners have several applicable
exceptions, commercial and consumer creditors have far fewer. Obviously, these
narrow exceptions are designed to address narrow financial and policy concerns.
Typically, the most applicable exceptions to the automatic stay are the enforcement of
liens against abusive bankruptcy filers barred or ineligible from bankruptcy protection
and the enforcement of eviction proceedings against evicted and imminently dangerous
tenants. With the exception of unavoidable transfers (a narrow category discussed
below), there are no exceptions for routine enforcement of debt obligations, self-help or
foreclosure against collateral, or the regular tools used for debt collection.
Domestic relations practitioners enjoy substantively greater exceptions to the
automatic stay. The automatic stay does not prevent the commencement or
continuation of civil actions to establish paternity, establishment or modification of
domestic support obligations, concerning child custody or visitation, for dissolution of a
marriage (except for property settlements), and regarding domestic violence. 11 U.S.C.
§ 362(b)(2)(A). These exceptions also allow for a substantial range of collection
methods to collect domestic support obligations. 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(2)(B) (G).
“Domestic support obligations” are a narrow class of obligations “in the nature of
alimony, maintenance, or support” and do not include all debts owed to a spouse,
former spouse, or child of the debtor. 11 U.S.C. § 101(14A).
In addition, the government also enjoys several exceptions to the automatic stay.
Criminal proceedings are unaffected by a bankruptcy filing. 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(1).
Additional government exceptions include everything from proceedings under the
Convention on the Prohibition of Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of
Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction to the licensing of educational institutions.
Practice Tip: Consult with bankruptcy counsel before engaging in any action against a
debtor in bankruptcy because the consequences of (even technical) violations of the
stay can be quite severe (and include attorney fee provisions). A few years back, the
Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana determined that a creditor had
violated the automatic stay by misapplying post-petition payments as part of a course of
conduct and imposed compensatory damages of $24,441.65, litigation costs of
$292,673.84, and punitive damages of $3,171,154. Jones v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg.,
Inc. (In re Jones), Case No. 06-1093, 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 1450 (E.D. La. April 5, 2012).
While this case is an outlier, it serves as an example of how violations of the automatic
stay may result in severe penalties.
Creditors seeking to engage in actions against the debtor may move the
Bankruptcy Court for an Order granting Relief from the Automatic Stay. Typically,
creditors seek relief either to obtain adequate protection from the debtor for their
collateral (or possession of the collateral) or to continue the liquidation of their claims
against a debtor in a proceeding pending before another court.
2.

Filing Your Proof of Claim

The proof of claim is a creditor’s statement to the court and trustee of the debt
owed to the creditor. When preparing a proof of claim, complete all sections of the
claim form and attach supporting documentation (subject to a five page limit). If you are
or represent a secured creditor, attach a copy of the security instrument or agreement
and proof that the security interest is properly perfected. You should file the original
proof of claim with the bankruptcy court and mail a copy to the debtor or, if represented,
the debtor’s counsel. Do not wait until the last minute to file the proof of claim. The claim
is deemed filed on the date it is received by the court, not the date of the postmark.
Creditors should be aware of Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9037 which
states that most documents may only contain the following: (1) the last four digits of the
social security number and taxpayer identification number; (2) the year of the
individual's birth; (3) the minor's initials; and/or (4) the last four digits of the financial
account number. If an unredacted document is filed, after notice to the creditor, debtors
may move to seal the document, require an amended document to be filed, and seek
attorney fees incurred in enforcing this privacy protection.
For most creditors, the deadline for filing proofs of claim in Chapter 7 cases with
assets is set forth in the Order Fixing Times for Proofs of Claims. All Chapter 7 cases
originate as no-asset cases, and creditors are instructed not to file claims unless they
receive a subsequent notice to do so. Once the §341 meeting is held, the trustee
generally makes a determination as to whether there are assets. Most creditors do not
attend this hearing. Deciding not to attend this hearing does not prejudice a creditor’s
right to file a claim or otherwise participate in the case. Once the trustee determines
that there are assets to administer, he or she will direct the clerk to send out a notice
instructing creditors to file claims and providing a proof of claim form for their use. The
deadline is on the notice to file claims the creditor will receive.
A proof of claim must be filed for most creditors as a precondition to having an
allowed claims which can share in the distribution of estate assets. For most creditors,
the failure to file a proof of claim puts them out of the game; the non-filing creditor is
effectively on the sideline.
There are several exceptions to this general rule. Secured creditors do not need
to file a claim to protect their lien status; if they are undersecured, the failure to file a
proof of claim will prevent them from sharing in the distribution for their unsecured
portion. Creditors having a non-dischargeable debt (which does not require filing an
adversary proceeding to establish) do not have their claims eliminated by failing to file a
proof of claim; however, they do miss the opportunity to share in the distribution of
estate assets.
3.

Domestic Support Obligation
a.
Priority Claim

In Chapter 7, DSOs are entitled to priority over nearly all creditors to receive nonexempt property of the estate. 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(1). In Chapter 13, DSO arrears
must be paid in full during the duration of the plan (with few exceptions), current
payments must be maintained during Chapter 13, and any post-petition arrears are
grounds for dismissal of the Chapter 13 case. 11 U.S.C. §§ 1322(a)(2), 1306(c).

b.

Post-Petition Compliance Requirements

Ongoing compliance with the Domestic Support Obligation through the pendency
of the Chapter 13 process is mandatory; non-compliance is generally ill-tolerated by the
Bankruptcy Court. Section 1307(c)(11) allows the bankruptcy court to dismiss or
convert a Chapter 13 case (whichever is in the best interests of creditors and the estate)
on the “failure of the debtor to pay any domestic support obligation that first becomes
payable after the date of the filing of the petition.” This provision only applies to
payments which become due after the case is filed; the pre-petition amounts are dealt
within the Chapter 13 plan. Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Bankruptcy Court
will generally give the debtor an opportunity to cure the post-petition arrears, but this
opportunity is generally of limited duration.
In addition, for the Chapter 13 debtor to complete their case and receive their
discharge, the post-petition DSOs must be paid and a certification made to the Court.
11 U.S.C. § 1328(a).
DSO compliance can be used as a means for forcing the dismissal or conversion
of a Chapter 13 debtor. For the creditor holding a property settlement claim (nondischargeable in Chapter 7), conversion can mean the elimination of competing
creditors, leaving the property settlement claims as the only outstanding claim.
4.

Property Settlement Options and Dischargeability

For the property settlement claim(s), the choice of chapter matters: the same
claims which are non-dischargeable in Chapter 7 are dischargeable in Chapter 13.
In a Chapter 7 case, the property settlement claim is automatically nondischargeable. During the pendency of the case (petition through discharge), collection
against the debtor is stayed by the automatic stay. Collection against property of the
estate is also stayed until the Trustee completes administration of the estate. Creditors
seeking to engage in actions against the debtor may move the Bankruptcy Court for an
Order granting Relief from the Automatic Stay.
In the Chapter 13 case, the property settlement claims will be discharged if the
debtor is able to successfully complete their Chapter 13 case. For this reason, it may
be advisable to ensure that the debtor is actually required to comply with all aspects of
their case and, to the extent that non-compliance is found, that dismissal or conversion
is sought.
5.

Preference / Fraudulent Conveyance Issues
a.
Preferences

The fundamental policy underlying the Bankruptcy Code is that similarly situated
creditors be treated the same way. Thus, unsecured creditors without priority will
receive pro-rata distributions of all remaining assets. Such a distribution scheme can be
thwarted by pre-petition transfers made by the debtor, whether the intention of the
debtor was to favor a particular creditor or not. Section 547 of the Code is designed to
avoid such preferences that frustrate the bankruptcy distribution scheme.

Section 547 states, in relevant part, that the trustee may avoid any transfer of an
interest of the debtor in property (a) to or for the benefit of a creditor; (b) for or on
account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made; (c)
made while the debtor was insolvent; (d) made on or within 90 days before the date of
the filing of the petition or, if the creditor was an insider, between 90 days and one year
before the date of the filing of the petition; and (e) that enables such creditor to receive
more than such creditor would receive if the case were a Chapter 7 case, the transfer
had not been made, and the creditor received payment to the extent provided by the
Bankruptcy Code.
Payments to general unsecured creditors are almost always preferences since
generally they would receive less in a liquidation. This analysis may grow much more
complicated with considerations of a division of marital assets: the division of assets
may determine to whom the property belongs rather than end up a potential payment in
satisfaction of an antecedent debt.
Payments to relatives made within one year of bankruptcy may also be
preferential. Usually, transfers among relatives are difficult to defend since relatives do
not normally document obligations. If a payment is large enough for a trustee in a
Chapter 7 to pursue, Mom may find a letter from the trustee in her mailbox. The
preference period for non-insider creditors may be extended to the one year period if
the transfer benefitted an inside creditor. Thus, transfers to a bank or other creditor that
benefitted an insider guarantor may also be voidable for the one-year period before a
bankruptcy filing.
While most preference cases involve the transfer of money, the preference
language is broadly written to encompass any transfer, including the transfer of a
security interest. If an unsecured creditor takes security within 90 days of bankruptcy,
thereby improving its position at the time of the bankruptcy, this transfer can likewise be
avoided.
There are a number of exceptions and defenses to preferences; the most
applicable in the family law area would be the exclusion of payments of DSOs. 11
U.S.C. § 547(c)(7).
The analysis of whether payments to creditors are avoidable preferences is
further complicated when multiple people are liable on the same debt. What happens
when payments are made on those debts?
First, spouses may be insiders of each other and, in most cases, will be
considered to be insiders. For an individual, statutory insiders include relatives of the
debtor with "relatives" including any "individual related by affinity or consanguinity within
the third degree as determined by the common law, or individual in a step or adoptive
relationship within such third degree." 11 U.S.C. §§ 101(31), (45). In dicta, the
Bankruptcy Appellate Panel has stated that a spouse is related by affinity. In re
Schuman, 81 B.R. 583, 585 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1987). However, under common law,
affinity was the kinship relationship existing as a result of marriage, but did not cover the
marital relationship of the parties to the marriage. 1 BL. COMM. 434; Barnhill v. Vaudreuil
(In re Busconi), 177 B.R. 153, 157 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1995) (holding that spouses are not

"relatives" under the Bankruptcy Code). That said, in most cases, a spouse will be an
insider as the definition of "insider" is "open-ended because the term is not precise."
Dye v. Brown (In re AFI Holding, Inc.), 355 B.R. 139 (9th Cir. 2006). "Insider status may
be based on a professional or business relationship with the debtor, in addition to the
Code's per se classifications, where such relationship compels the conclusion that the
individual or entity has a relationship with the debtor, close enough to gain an
advantage attributable simply to affinity rather than to the course of business dealings
between the parties." Friedman v. Sheila Plotsky Brokers, Inc. (In re Friedman), 126
B.R. 63, 70 (9th Cir. BAP 1991). In such a case, even if a spouse can avoid being a
statutory insider, that spouse will be considered a non-statutory insider. Ex-spouses, for
a variety of reasons, are generally not insiders. Schuman, 81 B.R. at 585.
Second, payment by one spouse of a mutual debt may be a transfer to a noninsider creditor (e.g. the credit card issuer) benefitting an insider creditor (e.g. the coobligated spouse). In this scenario, the transfer is not avoidable with respect to the noninsider creditor but is avoidable with respect to the insider creditors to the extent of the
benefit received. 11 U.S.C. § 547(i). This new section was added by BAPCPA to fully
effectuate the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994's attempt to protect institutional creditors
from the Deprizio Doctrine developed by the Seventh Circuit in Levit v. Ingersoll Rand
Financial Corp. (In re Deprizio Construction Co.), 874 F.2d 1186 (7th Cir. 1989), which
previously allowed a bankruptcy trustee to recover the transfer from the non-insider
creditor. As a result, where the debtor paid off a co-obligated debt within one year of
filing, while the trustee cannot recover from the creditor, the trustee can seek recovery
from the insider who benefitted from the payment. Thus, transfers to a bank or other
creditor that benefitted an insider guarantor may be voidable for the one-year period
before bankruptcy with respect to the insider guarantor.
These interactions truly come into play when evaluating payment of co-obligated
debts. For example, Husband and Wife are jointly obligated on a $10,000 credit card.
Husband has significant business debts for which Wife is not liable; as a result,
Husband will need to file bankruptcy while Wife will not need to file. They are also
planning to divorce. There are basically three different ways that Husband and Wife
can try to reach the end goal of having the credit card paid; ironically, the "simplest"
option (simply paying the debt) creates an avoidance preference.
Option 1:
If Husband pays off the credit card prior to the divorce and then
files bankruptcy after 90 days but within one year of payment, the trustee may be able
to recover the $10,000 from Wife. Assuming that Wife was an insider, the trustee may
avoid the preference only as to the insider creditor (Wife).
Option 2:
If Husband pays off the credit card after the divorce and then files
bankruptcy after 90 days but within one year of payment, the trustee will not be able to
recover as the payment does not constitute an insider preference.
Option 3:
If Husband divorces and is obligated to pay to Wife $10,000 as a
property settlement so that she can pay off the credit card, the trustee will not be able to
recover as the payment does not constitute a preference.

In all three of these scenarios, the same result is obtained (a paid-off credit card),
but in one scenario, the transfer may be avoided and, worst of all, put liability on the
Wife to the bankruptcy estate.
b.

Fraudulent Conveyances

The trustee in bankruptcy may use Section 544 (the so-called “Strong-Arm
Clause”) to set aside fraudulent conveyances made by the debtor within one year of
bankruptcy (Section 548) or using state law fraudulent conveyance statutes, via the
Strong-Arm Clause (Sections 544(a) and (b)), within four years of bankruptcy (under
Oregon law, ORS 95.200, et seq.).
Transfers that were made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity
to which the debt was or became indebted may be set aside. Actual intent to hinder,
delay, or defraud the creditor often must be shown by circumstantial evidence. Hinder,
delay, and defraud all have separate meanings, and each one alone can be a basis for
avoiding the transfer. The value given for a transfer can include a wide range of
consideration, including the satisfaction or securing of a debt. However, the value must
benefit the debtor and thus is more limited than the broad concept of consideration. In
re Nelsen, 24 B.R. 701 (Bankr. D. Or. 1982).
If a bankruptcy case is filed after the dissolution is finalized, the trustee may
examine whether transfers from the debtor to his former spouse were fraudulent in
nature, i.e., transfers for less than fair value. 11 U.S.C. §§ 544, 548. Given the prepetition planning opportunities present in a dissolution, especially if there is collusion
between the spouses, the trustee will carefully examine the dissolution judgment. A
scenario at one end of the spectrum, along with its predictable result is illustrated in In
re Beverly, while another scenario, representing the opposite end of the spectrum, is
illustrated in In re Bledsoe. Beverly v. Wolkowitz, 374 B.R. 221 (Cal. BAP 2007);
Bledsoe v. Bledsoe, 569 F.3d 1106 (9th Cir. 2009).
In Beverly, the debtor, an attorney facing both a large malpractice judgment and
a divorce, colluded with his spouse to divide their community property in such a way
that, while both parties received approximately half of the assets, he received primarily
exempt assets while she received non-exempt assets. While the Bankruptcy Court
believed that this was merely an aggressive but acceptable exercise in pre-bankruptcy
planning, the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (“BAP”) looked at the numerous badges of
fraud, the extensive evidence of intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, and their
opinion of the likely outcome of a dissolution without the collusive settlement
agreement. The BAP stated that “when a pig becomes a hog it is slaughtered,” (citing
the oft-quoted Dolese v. U.S., 605 F.2d 1146, 1154 (10th Cir. 1979)) and described a
series of letters detailing the arrangement to move home equity proceeds out of the
grasp of creditors and leave the debtor with only a million-dollar (and wholly exempt)
pension plan. The BAP presumed that a California court would divide exempt and nonexempt assets equally; as a result, to the extent that the settlement created a different
result which deprived creditors of assets to satisfy their claims, the settlement was a
fraudulent conveyance.

When Beverly was decided, it panicked many among both the bankruptcy and
family law bars. Because of the discussion of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act
(UFTA) in the footnotes, one might conclude that Beverly stood for the proposition that
any division of marital assets which was not an equal division of all non-exempt
property, regardless of what happens to the exempt property of the marital estate, could
be subject to collateral attack by a trustee as a fraudulent conveyance. Thankfully, that
does not seem to be the case where there is no evidence of fraud.
In June 2009, the Ninth Circuit decided Bledsoe v. Bledsoe and addressed the
same issues of fraudulent conveyance. Bledsoe v. Bledsoe, 569 F.3d 1106 (9th Cir.
2009). After eight years of marriage, Ryan Bledsoe filed for divorce from the debtor,
Jennifer Bledsoe. While Jennifer initially entered an appearance, that appearance was
struck after she failed to comply with discovery requirements and court orders in bad
faith. Ryan was granted a default judgment; he was awarded items valued at $93,737
while Jennifer was only award items valued at $788. After Ryan took 99% of the
alleged value, Jennifer filed for bankruptcy; the trustee in her case sought to recover
from Ryan half of the combined value of the marital assets.
Like Beverly, the Bledsoe Court agreed that a trustee may attack a judgment,
including a divorce judgment, as a fraudulent conveyance. However, in Bledsoe, the
trustee plead only a constructive fraud case; under Oregon law, extrinsic fraud is
required to attack a judgment. Bledsoe, 569 F.3d at 1109 (citing Greeninger v.
Cromwell, 140 Ore. App. 241, 915 P.2d 479, 481-82 (Or. Ct. App. 1996)). The trustee
also argued that Jennifer had received less than reasonable equivalent value; the
Bledsoe court agreed with the Bankruptcy Court in finding that “a state court’s
dissolution judgment, following a regularly conducted contested proceeding,
conclusively establishes ‘reasonable equivalent value’ for the purpose of § 548, in the
absence of actual fraud.” Bledsoe, 569 F.3d at 1111.
These two cases represent the less than typical way that dissolution cases are
conducted. In Beverly, the spouses, while arguing about details, worked together in an
actually fraudulent scheme to defraud the husband’s creditors, while in Bledsoe, the
spouses were unable to even make it through discovery without a judge signing a
default judgment against one of the spouses. Most dissolution cases are negotiated to
conclusion without litigation; the remainder are litigated with varying degrees of
contentiousness. It appears that as long as there is no evidence of extrinsic fraud on
creditors - and even where there is a “long half” provided to the non-filing spouse,
Bledsoe should provide a measure of comfort to the domestic relations practitioner.
While it may be important to have bankruptcy counsel in the loop to interpret the
possible impact of a bankruptcy filing by a future ex-spouse, as long as there is no
active scheme to defraud creditors, the dissolution judgment should stand.
III.
A.

Collecting Your Attorney Fees
Obtaining Funds from Your Clients

The easiest way to obtain funds from clients is for those clients to provide cash
retainers, prior to services rendered, in an amount sufficient to cover all of the expenses
incurred in the litigation. In a similar vein, the easiest way to win a lawsuit is to have
your opponent concede (and hand over certified funds along with the stipulated

judgment). As a practical matter, even if the client had the ability to pay a cash retainer,
they wouldn’t – just as no one pays anyone 100% prior to services being rendered.
Retainer(s) throughout the case have two purposes: first, it provides a guarantee
that the lawyer will be paid for their work and, second, it puts the client’s “skin” into the
equation. Retainers should be supplemented as much as necessary as a case
develops – either with scheduled supplementation (e.g. $500 each month) or with
replenishment requirements (e.g. a trust balance of at least $1,000 throughout the case
and a $10,000 balance not later than 30 days prior to scheduled trial). Clients who have
clear understanding of the costs of their dispute may be more reasonable, amicable,
and resolution orientated.
If, after representation, the client has an outstanding balance, it is necessary to
engage in collection with the client. General collection strategies can help get clients
paying on outstanding bills: regular invoices, reminders of outstanding balances,
telephone calls, and easy ways to pay (online payments, for example).
For clients who are happy with your services, but lack the ability to send the
money at once will often do nothing. Many are embarrassed about their inability to pay
and, in some cases, they have a “plan” to pay when some event happens … tax refund
arrives, Aunt Muriel dies, or they get a bonus. Too often, however, when these events
do occur, the funds have been “promised” to competing creditors or desires. Many of
these clients will happily pay on a regular schedule or even set up an automatic monthly
payment if they know that are “allowed” to do that. While receiving a slow trickle of
money from a client is not optimal, once many clients are all making payments, it can
create a positive revenue stream, even if current work slows. Even better, getting paid
something on an account is better than nothing, especially if it requires little effort to get
going.
For clients who are unhappy with your services, the lack of payment may signal
their withholding of payment until it has been resolved (or their unilateral reduction). For
these clients, the Oregon State Bar’s Fee Arbitration and Fee Mediation program may
be a way to reach an agreeable outcome. Fee mediation is a nonbinding process to
reach a mutually agreeable outcome with a neutral third-party. Fee arbitration is a
binding decision by an arbitrator (or panel) based on the information presented by the
parties. Both processes are voluntary and both parties must agree.
For clients who just aren’t going to pay, there’s little that can be done.
In any scenario, once non-judicial collection methods have been exhausted,
there is question of whether to pursue a lawsuit against the client. It would seem that, in
general, litigation to collect outstanding fees is problematic. For those clients who can’t
pay the outstanding balance, the judgment will be more collectible than the balance.
For those clients who refuse to pay, all of the difficulties of collection (see above) come
into play. And, for those clients unhappy with your services (and those who simply don’t
want to pay), their defense to your suit for fees will be allegations of malpractice.
If brought within the two year statute of limitation, the malpractice claims will
garner PLF coverage (as to the malpractice issues only) as the lawyer (and their

insurer) will be “on the hook.” If not brought in the two year statute of limitations, the
malpractice claim will simply act as a recoupment defense against the outstanding
balance. "'Recoupment' is an equitable remedy that reduces, mitigates, or abates
damages alleged by the plaintiff." State ex rel. Key West Retaining Systems, Inc. v.
Holm II, Inc., 185 Or. App. 182, 190 (2002) (citations and internal quotations omitted),
rev. den., 335 Or. 402 (2003). Since the outstanding fees and any malpractice claim
arose from the same set of facts (the legal representation), recoupment allows
malpractice to be argued in mitigation of fees. "Recoupment is confined to matters
arising out of and connected with the transaction upon which the action is brought."
Rogue River Management Co. v. Shaw, 243 Or. 54, 58 (1966). This is true even when
the malpractice claim couldn’t be brought as it would otherwise be time-barred – it can
be used to reduce or element damages even when the claim under which recoupment
is sought would be barred by the statute of limitation if brought as a claim. See Shannon
v. Carter, 282 Or. 449, 453-54 (1978), cert. den., 439 U.S. 1090 (1979); see also Dixon
v. Schoonover, 226 Or. 443, 453-54 (1961) (stating recoupment can lie where an
independent action would be barred by the statute of limitations).
B.

Attorney Liens

Attorneys have both possessory and non-possessory liens for their outstanding
fees. The possessory lien allows the attorney to retain papers, personal property, and
money until the client’s obligation is paid. ORS 87.430. The non-possessory lien gives
the attorney a lien on actions, suits, or proceedings (once they have been commenced)
along with the proceeds (e.g. the judgment) until the client’s obligation is paid. ORS
87.445.
1.

Ethical Issues

The use of the possessory attorney lien to collect attorney fees is ethically
controversial. The entire purpose of the retaining lien is to permit the attorney hold the
client’s wanted and desired property to coerce payment; this purpose must be exercised
in the context of the attorney’s fiduciary duties to the client. At the same time, attorneys
are expressly permitted to “retain papers, personal property and money of the client to
the extent permitted by other law.” ORPC 1.16(d).
Under Formal Opinion 2005-90, this balancing is premised upon the client’s
ability to pay: “If the lien is otherwise valid and if the client has sufficient resources to
pay the lawyer what is due but chooses neither to make payment nor to file a bond, the
lawyer may lawfully withhold the client’s materials. If, however, the client does not have
sufficient resources to pay the lawyer in full and if surrender of the materials is
necessary to avoid foreseeable prejudice to the client, the attorney lien must yield to the
fiduciary duty that the lawyer owes to the client on payment of whatever amount the
client can afford to pay.”
2.

Mechanical Requirements

For the possessory attorney lien, the lawyer must retain possession of the
papers, personal property and money. If delivery is sought by the client (under ORS

9.360), the court shall impose security, if appropriate, and determine the validity of the
lien, as necessary. ORS 9.370.
For the non-possessory attorney lien, the statute itself "serves as notice to the
world that an attorney's lien for fees arises when an action is commenced" and no
further notice is required. Potter v. Schlesser Co., Inc. , 335 Ore. 209, 213 (Or. 2003). In
Potter, the attorney's client and the defendant had agreed to a settlement, after
commencement, and without the participation or knowledge of the attorney. The
defendant paid the client the entire settlement; the attorney pursued the defendant for
the payment of the attorney fees. The Oregon Supreme Court found the defendant
liable for the attorney fees: "The lien is a charge on the action, and the parties to the
action cannot extinguish or affect the attorney's lien by any means (such as settlement)
other than by satisfying the underlying claim of the attorney for the fees incurred in
connection with the action." Potter, 335 Ore. at 214. Settlement does not affect an
attorney's lien: "... the lien created by ORS 87.445 is not affected by a settlement
between the parties to the action, suit or proceeding before or after judgment, order or
award." ORS 87.475(1). Under Potter, the attorney lien is properly perfected and arises
at the commencement of an action. The attorney can also claim the lien by filing notice
with the court that entered the judgment and providing the same to the client. ORS
87.450. Filing notice should be done as it will ensure the lien is effective against thirdparties and that, if proceeds of the judgment are to be sold, the attorney’s lien can be
identified and satisfied.
C.

Securing Attorney Fees against Client Property

When a client does not have the current, liquid assets to pay either contemplated or
outstanding attorney fees, it may be worth considering acquiring a security interest in
the client's real or personal property. This security can either stand as the source of
payment or as an enforcement mechanism for a repayment schedule.
1.

Ethical Issues

The attorney's acquisition of a security interest in client property to secure earned
or contemplated attorney fees will generally arise after the establishment of the
attorney-client relationship. As a result, compliance with the Oregon Rules of
Professional Conduct ("ORPC") is required as ORPC 1.8 specifically addresses the
acquisition of a security interest adverse to the client:
A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly
acquire an ownership, possessory, security or other pecuniary interest adverse to a
client unless:
(1) the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires
the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully
disclosed and transmitted in writing in a manner that can be
reasonably understood by the client;
(2) the client is advised in writing of the desirability of
seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the
advice of independent legal counsel on the transaction; and

(3) the client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by
the client, to the essential terms of the transaction and the
lawyer's role in the transaction, including whether the lawyer
is representing the client in the transaction.
ORPC 1.8(a).
2.

Mechanical Requirements

The first step in taking a security interest in client property is to comply with the
Oregon Rules of Professional Conduct. This should be done through a specifically
drafted letter to the client, a copy of which should be signed and returned by the client.
The underlying terms should be fair and reasonable to the client. Some fee
agreements provide for interest/late charges for outstanding balances at 1.5% per
month. If the outstanding obligation is going to be secured against real property, the
attorney should consider whether a 19.5% APR loan against their client’s real property
is “fair and reasonable.” While Formal Ethic Opinion 2005-97 concludes that “we do not
believe that an 18% charge would be clearly excessive or unreasonable,” it still holds
out the possibility that the “the fee agreement taken as a whole could be said to be
clearly excessive or unreasonable.”
The terms must also be communicated to the client in a manner that can be
reasonably understood by the client. While these types of transactions would not be
generally governed by the Truth in Lending Act or Regulation Z, voluntary use of the
ubiquitous “Disclosure Box” can help address the ethical requirement. Since the
security documents are going to be written by lawyers/for lawyers, including a
Disclosure Box in the informed consent letter or other documents evidencing the
transaction can ensure that your client has received this information. Since this form
would also be the same as other disclosures made to the client in common consumer
transactions (e.g. credit cards, vehicle purchases, real property loans), it can avoid
allegations that the client did not understand the transaction.
As part of the written documentation for the transaction, the client must be
advised of the desirability of seeking independent counsel.
Finally, the attorney must obtain the client’s written informed consent, the client’s
“agreement … to a proposed course of conduct after the lawyer has communicated
adequate information and explanation about the material risks of and reasonably
available alternatives to the proposed course of conduct.” ORPC 1.0(g).
Second, the attorney must provide the appropriate security agreement to secure
the obligation. The most common method to secure payment of attorney fees is to take
a security interest in real property. In many cases, the work of the attorney was
instrumental in acquiring the real property. In other cases, valuable personal property
(tangible or intangible) is used as collateral. The purpose of the security may govern
the collateral used – just as the lawyer should consider the overall strategy for collection
against their client’s debtor(s), the lawyer should consider their own willingness for
collection in taking security. For the attorney who is unwilling to aggressively pursue
collection against a client or former client, taking a security interest in real property

(even if partially unsecured) may be preferable to taking a security interest in account
receivables – to be paid on the real property lien, the lawyer must simply wait until the
property is sold or refinanced, while on the ARs, the lawyer must exercise the rights
under the security interest to collect and enforce the accounts collateral.
If the lawyer is not generally familiar with drafting security agreements, the use of
legal forms for generic transactions (e.g. trust deed against real property) may be
sufficient. For more complex security agreements, the lawyer may wish to be
represented.
Third, the security interest must be perfected by the appropriate means. For real
property, this means recording with the County Recorder, for some personal property,
this means a UCC filing with the Secretary of State, and for other personal property, this
means notation, registration, or filing with the appropriate authority (e.g. a security
interest in an aircraft requires recording with the Federal Aviation Administration).
D.

Failure to Comply (Recoupment)

The failure to comply with the ethical requirements for obtaining an interest in client
property is both a violation of the ethical rules (subjecting the attorney to potential
discipline) and may constitute such a violation of the attorney’s fiduciary duties as to
merit an elimination of the outstanding fees (or even disgorgement). The disgorgement,
reduction, or denial of fees to an attorney is appropriate when an attorney violates a
fiduciary duty through a conflict of interest. Kidney Ass'n of Or. Inc. v. Ferguson, 315 Or.
135, 143-44 (1992); Portland Gen. Elec. v. Duncan, Wienberg, Miller, & Pembroke,
P.C., 162 Or.App. 265, 276-78 (1999). The reasoning behind the rule is: "[w]hen a court
reduces or denies attorney fees as a consequence of a lawyer's breach of fiduciary
duty, it is a reflection of the limited value that a client receives from the services of an
unfaithful lawyer." Kidney, 315 Or. at 144 (citation omitted) (finding ultimately that no
conflict of interest existed). Courts from other jurisdictions have held the same with
even a few finding that a breach of the duty of loyalty per se gives rise to fee forfeiture.
See Jeffry v. Pounds, 136 Cal.Rptr. 373, 377 (Cal. Ct. App. 1977) (stating that California
courts have held that an attorney is not entitled to any compensation after a breach of
the duty of loyalty, i.e., a conflict of interest, arises); U.S. v. Jerry M. Lewis Truck Parts
& Equipment, 89 F.3d 574, 579-80 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing California cases for rule that
"when the ethical violation in question is a conflict of interest between the attorney and
the client (or between the attorney and a former client), the appropriate fee for the
attorney is zero") (citations omitted).
E.

Bankruptcy - Your Proof of Claim

If the particular client is simply unable to pay the outstanding balance, it is
probable that the attorney is not the only creditor. Either the client will reach a financial
equilibrium with the client’s creditors or will end up in an insolvency proceeding.
At best, the attorney has an unavoidable, perfected security interest and a client
who wants to see the attorney paid. Here, the attorney may find positive treatment in a
plan of reorganization and may just need to submit a Proof of Claim to the Court to
allow the Trustee to make full payment on the outstanding balance. At worst, the

attorney has a disgruntled client along with a security interest obtained without informed
consent. Here, the attorney may find an objection to any payment to the attorney,
claims of recoupment, and plead allegations which are brought to the attention of
discipline counsel.
Most commonly, however, is that the attorney is simply another general
unsecured creditor of the debtor, entitled to share in the distribution, if any, made to
general unsecured creditors. As described in Section II.C.2, the attorney will need to
prepare and file a Proof of Claim. Depending on the case, it may also make sense to
be an active creditor; however, in many cases, the expected disbursement (a few cents
on the dollar) may not justify any further action.
IV.

Conclusion

Collections, whether from a judgment debtor or your own client, is both a science
and an art. Knowing the options available to you to enforce these obligations, along
with their advantages and disadvantages, can provide the raw tools for collection. This
is then combined with your experience and feel for the particular debtor, letting you
achieve maximum returns for the efforts expended.

Addressing Taxes Throughout a Dissolution Case
I.

Overview.

The tax assessment, collection and resolution procedures of the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) and the Oregon Department of Revenue (“ODR”) typically run parallel to one another.
Unless otherwise stated in the Oregon Revised Statutes, Oregon’s taxation laws incorporate and
mirror those in the Internal Revenue Code. While these materials will primarily focus on the IRS,
the information is generally applicable to the ODR as well.
A.

Assessment.

A tax assessment is the acknowledgment and recordation of a tax liability in the IRS’s records.
Each tax period results in a separate assessment. Assessment is the last step in the determination of
a tax liability and a prerequisite to forced collection.
The most common assessment is self-assessment by filing an original or amended return
showing the tax liability. If the taxpayer fails to file a tax return, the IRS may “file” a substituted
return for the taxpayer using the income information received from third parties. The IRS provides
the taxpayer with notice and an opportunity to respond prior to “filing” its own substituted return.
The tax liability shown on a substituted return is greatly inflated because the IRS enters only the
taxpayer’s income but does not account for deductions. The taxpayer may file an “amended
return” to correct and reduce the tax due under the substituted return.
The IRS may also assess a tax at the conclusion of an audit or after a civil penalty or third
party liability investigation. In most cases the IRS must provide the taxpayer with notice of the
proposed assessment and an opportunity to respond prior to making a formal assessment.
B.

Joint and Several Liability.

If spouses file a joint tax return, the IRS holds each spouse jointly and severally liable for
the full tax shown on the return, and for any amount arising from a subsequent audit. While each
spouse is liable for the entire tax, the IRS may only collect the tax once. The IRS will credit each
spouse’s account with all payments received regardless of the source.
The IRS does not recognize allocation of any tax debt by spouses in a stipulated judgment
or a divorce decree. In fact, the IRS will always ignore the allocation and collect against whichever
party it can. It may also collect from both parties at the same time. The parties can then attempt to
collect the “overpayment” from their former spouse.
Married couples filing joint returns are not the only taxpayers subject to joint and several
liability. The IRS may assess multiple parties with the same tax in a host of different
circumstances. Most commonly, the IRS will assess officers of a business with civil penalties if the
business fails to pay certain tax such as withholding tax. Officers of the business, certain
employees and the business itself may be jointly and severally liable on the same tax. The IRS may
collect the entire tax from any one of the parties or it may collect different portions from different

Page 1 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

parties based on their ability to pay. Again, it may only collect the total tax once. The IRS has no
interest in equalizing the debt among those liable.
Practice Tip: Advise clients when joint and several tax liability exists. Make them aware that the
IRS may collect against them regardless of what the divorce decree or judgment says. Include
recourse language in the Judgment of Dissolution so that if the tax debt is not paid as allocated,
attorney fees for tax representation and enforcement of the decree may be awarded.
C.

Collection.

If the tax is not promptly paid after assessment, the IRS may begin forced collection
actions. This begins with the mailing of collection notices. The IRS issues a series of five or six
collection notices; each becomes progressively more threatening until, finally, the taxpayer
receives either a “Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Your Right to a Hearing” or a “Notice of
Federal Tax Lien Filing and Your Right to a Hearing”. The “hearing” referred to is the taxpayer’s
collection due process appeal (“CDP Appeal”). The taxpayer is given the opportunity to formally
appeal forced collections efforts or a lien filing only once and must file the CDP Appeal within 30
days from the date of the notice. Except in special circumstances, the IRS must refrain from forced
collections, such as seizures of property, until the taxpayer=s appeal rights expire. If the taxpayer
fails to timely file a CDP Appeal, the taxpayer is exposed to levies and garnishments. The entire
notice process takes anywhere from four to eight months.
It is extremely important that the taxpayer actually receive the IRS’s notices. Notice is
proper if the IRS sends the notice to the last known address provided by the taxpayer.
Unfortunately, the last known address is often the address listed on the taxpayer’s last filed return.
This may be out of date for those that have not filed tax returns or for those that have moved due to
a recent separation or divorce. The taxpayer must notify the IRS in writing by using IRS Form
8822 or by writing a letter that includes the taxpayer’s full name, old and new address, social
security number and signature. For joint filers, each spouse must sign. If the taxpayers have
separated since filing a joint return, each spouse is required to notify the IRS of his or her new
address.
Once collection starts, there are few limits on the IRS’s power to collect. It may levy on
bank accounts, accounts receivable or any funds due and owing to the taxpayer. It may garnish a
taxpayer’s wages without the 25% gross wage limitation of other creditors. The IRS has its own
exemption calculations and they are far less than reasonable. For example, a single or married
filing separate individual with no dependents may exempt a mere $858 from garnishment per
month. A head of household with two children may exempt only $1,771 per month. The IRS may
also lien and levy a taxpayer’s retirement account and garnish social security payments. It can
summon bank records and information from third parties, without commencing a lawsuit!
In contrast, the ODR behaves more like an ordinary creditor. It is subject to a 25%
limitation on a taxpayer’s wages and does not take priority over other creditors with garnishments
already in place. Neither can the ODR seize retirement accounts. In addition, once the ODR
commences garnishment, it admittedly refuses to release the garnishment until the tax is paid in

Page 2 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

full. In contrast, the IRS will release a garnishment once the taxpayer enters into a formal
installment agreement or other plan of resolution.
Practice Tip: Provide separated or divorced clients with Form 8822 and instructions, and advise
them to send it into the IRS immediately. They should also consider entering into a payment plan
with the ODR before garnishments begin and before applying for a payment plan with the IRS.
D.

Statute of Limitations.
1.

No Limitation.

There is no federal statute of limitations on assessment of unfiled or fraudulent
returns. The ODR has no statute of limitations on tax collection period.
2.

Three Years.

The normal statute of limitations for tax assessment is three years. The IRS may
audit and assess any additional tax within three years from the due date of the return or the filing
date, whichever is later. If the taxpayer is in the middle of an audit and the statute of limitations is
about to run, the IRS will often ask the taxpayer to voluntarily extend the statute. This request can
raise a myriad of issues.
Refund claims must be made within three years of the due date of the return or two
years from the date of the payment, whichever is later.
3.

Six Years.

The statute of limitations period for audit and assessment extends to six years if
there is a substantial understatement of income. An understatement of 25% or more of total income
is considered substantial.
4.

Ten Years.

The IRS has ten years to collect a tax once assessed. Several actions will toll the
collection statute. These include filing a bankruptcy, filing a CDP Appeal, submitting an offer in
compromise and filing for innocent spouse relief. It is common for the statute to be tolled while
each action is pending plus an amount of additional time to allow the IRS the opportunity to place
the taxpayer’s file back in collections.
II.

Tax Returns.
A.

Filing Status.

Taxpayers are considered married for the entire year for tax purposes if they have not
obtained a final decree or entered a judgment before the last day of the tax year. For tax purposes,
an interlocutory decree is not a final decree. Same sex marriages are recognized so long as the

Page 3 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

couple was married in a state that lawfully allows same-sex marriages. Registered domestic
partnerships and civil unions are not considered marriages for federal tax purposes. A married
couple must generally file married filing jointly (“MFJ”) or married filing separately (“MFS”).
A physically separated spouse has the option to file as head of household if he or she meets
the following criteria: (1) considered unmarried on the last day of the year; (2) paid more than half
the cost of keeping up the home; and (3) had a qualified person living with them for more than half
the year. The costs of keeping up the home include rent, mortgage, taxes, insurance, repairs,
utilities, and the food eaten in the home. A taxpayer is considered unmarried if he or she meets the
following criteria: (1) filed a separate return; (2) paid more than half the cost of keeping up the
home; (3) did not live with a spouse during the last six months of the year; (4) the taxpayer’s home
was the main home of their child for more than half the year; and (5) he or she is able to claim an
exemption for the child.
Taxpayers facing divorce often agree to file previously unfiled returns as MFS to get the
lowest tax rate. However, there are important factors to consider before deciding on a filing status.
The amount of savings from filing jointly increases as the taxable income increases. Taxable
income is the net income after exemptions and deductions. A partial summary of the 2015 tax rates
under the three status options are as follows:
Taxable Income

MFS Tax

MFJ Tax

HOH

$25,000
$50,000
$75,000
$100,000
$150,000
$200,000

$3,289
$8,294
$14,544
$21,526
$37,265
$53,765

$2,828
$6,578
$10,338
$16,588
$29,088
$43,052

$3,103
$6,913
$13,163
$19,413
$32,586
$46,586

If the taxpayers intend to pay the tax in full when the tax return is filed, MFJ may be
advisable. If the taxpayers are unable to pay the tax in full, however, each spouse needs to consider
whether he or she is willing to accept joint and several liability. Are they informed of the
household finances including their spouse’s income and expenses? Did they take aggressive
positions on their tax issues? Are they certain the tax will be paid as agreed? If they are audited
later, after divorce, they will be jointly and severally liable for any additional tax assessed on a
MFJ return.
If they choose to file MFS or HOH, each spouse will report his or her individual income
and be liable for only their own tax. MFS taxpayers will pay a higher tax rate and are not allowed
certain deductions and credits. If one spouse is unwilling to file MFJ returns for fear the liability
will not be paid or files MFS or HOH before the parties come to a consensus or contrary to the
parties’ agreement, the couple may convert to a joint filing for up to three years. The spouses must
pay the MFJ tax due before the IRS will allow the election. The taxpayers may not, however,
amend a MFJ return to a MFS or HOH.

Page 4 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

Practice Tip: Consider whether your client should agree to or request MFJ status on unfiled tax
returns. If your client is nervous about his or her spouse not paying the tax, offer the MFJ election
as an option, but only after proof of payment. The MFJ election can be a win-win for both spouses
if the tax is actually paid within three years.
B.

Deduction, Credit and Payment Allocations.

There is a good deal of confusion over who can claim what when filing MFS during the
marriage and separation. We will address a few of the most common issues. If one spouse itemizes
deductions, the other spouse must itemize as well. Taxpayers may claim deductions for certain
expenses paid separately or jointly with their spouses. If the expense is paid from separate funds of
one spouse, only that spouse may deduct the expense. However, if an expense is paid from joint
funds, the taxpayers may split the deduction. An exception to this is that if only one spouse is
entitled to the deduction, only that spouse may take it regardless of whether it was paid with joint
funds.
Itemized deductions on MFS returns are treated differently. For example, medical
expenses paid from a joint account must be split between the spouses. Each spouse may deduct
only the state income tax, property tax, and mortgage interest that he or she alone paid. Casualty
losses on a jointly owned home must be split equally. Lastly, strange as it may sound, neither
spouse may claim a deduction for student loan interest or the tuition and fees deduction.
MFS taxpayers may not take certain credits or must reduce them by half. Filing HOH
instead of MFS, if allowed, will result in a lower tax rate and the ability to capture a few additional
deductions and credits not available if filing MFS.
A taxpayer may claim an exemption only for a “qualifying child”. Typically a child is a
qualifying child to the custodial parent. The custodial parent is the parent with whom the child
lived the most. For federal tax purposes, a child may be treated as a qualifying child for the
non-custodial parent if: (1) the parents are divorced or legally separated or lived apart at all times
in last six months of the year; (2) the child received over half of its support from its parents and was
in the custody of its parents for more than half the year; and (3) the custodial parent signs a written
declaration that he or she will not claim the child as an exemption. The non-custodial parent
attaches the statement to his or her return. The non-custodial parent must use IRS Form 8332 or a
similar statement for his or her written declaration. IRS Form 8332 may be used to release the
exemption for one year, a number of specified years or all future years. The election is revocable.
Lastly, taxpayers who made joint estimated tax deposits but then file separate returns may
allocate the estimated tax payments as they see fit. If they cannot agree on an allocation, the IRS
will do it for them.
Practice Tip: Advise your client to consult a tax professional during separation and immediately
following the divorce. **All expenses related to the determination of a tax are deductible.

Page 5 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

Practice Tip: Require the parties to fill out Form 8332 to reflect the parties’ agreement as to
claiming a child for tax exemption purposes. It is difficult to correct an incorrectly claimed child
exemption.
C.

Characterization.
1.

Alimony.

Alimony is deductible to the payer and income to the recipient. It is the payment of
cash to or for the benefit of a former spouse pursuant to a divorce decree or settlement agreement.
The divorce decree or separation agreement may not designate the spousal support payment as
child support. The taxpayers may not live in the same house at the time the payment is made and
the payer must not be liable for any payment after the death of the recipient.
Alimony payments must be made in cash to or for the benefit of the former spouse.
Unless specifically identified in the divorce decree, payments made directly to third parties,
payments in kind, or purchases of specific items are not considered alimony. Use of the payer=s
property is not considered alimony. If the taxpayer continues to own the home and must pay the
mortgage, insurance, taxes, etc., but allows the former spouse to live there rent free, the expenses
related to the home are not deductible as alimony. If the home remains jointly owned, half of the
expenses may qualify as alimony. On the other hand, life insurance premiums required under a
divorce decree are considered alimony if the former spouse owns the policy.
Lastly, if any amount specified as alimony will be reduced on the happening of a
contingency related to a child, such as reaching a specified age, marrying, dying, leaving or
attending school, an amount equal to the reduction will be treated as child support and not alimony.
Practice Tip: Make sure a client paying alimony understands that payments in kind, purchases of
items and payments made to any third party not listed in the divorce decree are not deductible as
alimony.
2.

Child Support.

Child support is not deductible to the payer and not taxable income to the recipient.
Payments of child support must be designated as such in the divorce decree or stipulated judgment.
If payments are lumped together as “family support”, none of it will be considered child support
for tax purposes.
III.

Tax Liens.
A.

Overview.

A statutory lien arises as a matter of law when the tax is assessed and goes unpaid. The
federal tax lien attaches to all of the taxpayer’s property and rights to property that belong to the
taxpayer existing then or later acquired. The ODR’s tax lien is more limited. It is afforded the same

Page 6 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

rights as an ordinary judgment lien against real property and is subject to Oregon property
exemptions. The federal tax lien suffers no such limitations.
The IRS files a Notice of Federal Lien with the Oregon Secretary of State to perfect its
interest against personal property and in a county’s recording office to perfect its interest against
real property located in that county. A tax lien must be filed before it is entitled to priority over
security interest holders, purchasers, mechanic’s liens and judgment lien creditors. However,
priority of filed and competing federal and state tax liens is determined by the date of assessment
of the tax and not by filing date. The IRS lien need not be filed to be valid against most other
interests arising after assessment. A few liens enjoy priority over federal tax liens regardless of
when the lien came into existence, including attorney liens and property taxes.
B.

Expiration and Renewal.

A federal tax lien is valid for ten years. Several circumstances extend this period, including
the filing of a bankruptcy. In addition, the IRS may commence suit and reduce its liability to
judgment. Reducing the liability to judgment gives the IRS the same collection rights as other
judgment creditors, including the ability to renew the judgment for an additional ten years. In
practice, the IRS rarely reduces a lien to judgment.
C.

Subordination.

In certain circumstances, the IRS may subordinate its lien to other creditors. A taxpayer
requests subordination by completing and submitting IRS Form 14134. If a taxpayer wants to
refinance his or her home, the IRS will typically subordinate its lien to the new loan so long as it is
not more than the original loan or the taxpayers agree to pay the IRS the difference. The IRS will
also subordinate its lien to a taxpayer’s essential creditors when the taxpayer relies on the creditor
for continued business operation or the generation of income. Any subordination is discretionary.
D.

Release, Withdrawal and Discharge.

Tax liens may be released, withdrawn, or discharged. Each is a different process and has
different results.
A federal tax lien is released when the debt is paid full, when a taxpayer has satisfied the
monetary obligations of an accepted offer in compromise, or when the collection statute has run.
The IRS will file a certificate of release where the original lien was filed. The lien and release will
continue to be public record and stays on the taxpayer’s credit report for at least seven years.
The IRS may withdraw a notice of lien filing from public record if it made a procedural
error, the taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement and certain conditions are met, or if
the lien was filed during a bankruptcy proceeding. It may also withdraw its lien if doing so will
help the taxpayer pay the tax or if it is in the taxpayer’s and the IRS’s best interest. The IRS will
withdraw its lien if the taxpayer can show the filing of a tax lien will result in his or her inability to
earn income and pay the tax. An example of this is an investment banker or stock broker whose
employment contract states that he or she will be terminated if a tax lien is filed. If the withdrawal

Page 7 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

is granted, the original filing and the withdrawal will not be public record and will not show on a
credit report.
The IRS may also discharge a tax lien. A lien discharge removes the lien from specific
property. A taxpayer or a party of interest may apply for a partial or complete lien discharge using
IRS Form 14135. The IRS will generally grant a discharge if the IRS receives an amount not less
than the value of its interest in the property or if its interest in the property has no value. This often
occurs when a property is over-encumbered due to mortgages and judgment liens or when
taxpayers are attempting to short sell their home.
Practice Tip: Encourage your client to refinance or demand the other spouse refinance jointly held
property that will be awarded to one spouse or the other immediately following or during divorce,
regardless of a lien filing.
IV.

New Liabilities.
A.

Property Settlement.

Generally, there is no gain or loss realized on the transfer of property between spouses
incident to divorce. This includes all real and personal property. A property transfer is incident to
divorce if the transfer occurs within one year after the date the marriage ends or is related to the end
of the marriage. A property transfer is related to the end of the marriage if the transfer is pursuant to
the divorce decree or separation agreement and occurs within six years of the date the marriage
ended.
B.

Asset Liquidation.

The sale or other disposition of a capital asset often generates taxable income or loss. A
capital asset is defined in terms of what is not a capital asset. For purposes of this article, think of a
capital asset as something owned for income or investment purposes (including a primary
residence). Income from the sale of a capital asset is generally capital gain to the extent that the
amount realized exceeds the taxpayer’s basis. However, the disposition of a capital asset can
generate income in unexpected ways.
The most common capital asset for a married couple is the couple’s home. However, gain
on the sale of a principal residence receives special treatment. The first $500,000 of capital gain is
exempt from tax for a married couple ($250,000 for an individual) so long as certain requirements
are met. In addition, through 2014, up to $2,000,000 in cancelled debt on a principal residence has
been exempt from taxation as ordinary income. No one knows if this exclusion for cancelled debt
of a principal residence will be renewed for 2015.
The determination of tax liabilities from the disposition of capital assets other than a
principal residence, such as rental property, becomes more complicated. Capital gain is created to
the extent the amount realized exceeds the taxpayer’s basis. In addition, debt forgiven becomes
cancelled indebtedness and is taxed as ordinary income (cancellation of indebtedness or COD
income). But wait - there’s more. The amount and character realized at disposition can change,

Page 8 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

depending on whether the debt on the property is recourse or nonrecourse - and COD income is
subject to certain exceptions, such as insolvency and bankruptcy.
Because this article is not intended to create tax attorneys, I will conclude this topic with the
superficial discussion above. Practitioners should keep in mind that all capital assets carry a
potential tax liability; a liability which can come from unexpected sources and can arrive years
after a divorce.
Practice Tip: If a divorcing couple owns capital assets, the situation should be discussed with a
CPA or tax attorney before the property settlement discussion proceeds too far.
C.

Audit.

IRS audits can create or increase joint and several liability for previously filed income tax
returns, even after a divorce. Audits can increase the tax due in a variety of ways, including finding
undisclosed income and reducing or eliminating deductions. The IRS performs random and
targeted audits. The scope of an audit can range from the taxpayer receiving a notice that an
adjustment is being made to the taxpayers return because the IRS records do not match with the
taxpayers, to an assigned revenue agent coming to the taxpayer’s place of business and going
through financial records. Taxpayers with rental property or other businesses are more likely to be
flagged for audit than are wage earners.
The IRS attempts to audit returns promptly and so most audits occur within two years of
filing. The IRS typically begins the audit by sending the taxpayer an introduction letter requesting
an appointment and requesting documentation to support items in the tax return. The audit will
start with one year and if the IRS concludes that adjustments are necessary, expand the scope of the
audit to three years. By statute, the IRS can audit the past three years, measured from the later of
the date the return was due or filed. The three year look-back, however, is doubled to six years if
the IRS finds the income is understated by 25% or more.
The IRS and the ODR have a reciprocal reporting agreement in which each taxing
authority reports its audit adjustments to the other. If the ODR receives notice of the audit from the
IRS it will mirror the federal audit adjustments on the taxpayer’s state return. The ODR has an
additional two years from the date it receives notice of the federal adjustments to make an
assessment. The IRS’s statute of limitations is not extended when it receives notice of audit
adjustments from the ODR. The ODR is slow to report its audit adjustments to the IRS and the
IRS’s statute of limitations on assessment often runs before it is able to make the adjustments on
the federal returns.
Practice Tip: The scope of the audit will almost always expand and be worse than the taxpayer
expects. If a MFJ return is audited during a separation or after divorce, each spouse should have
separate tax representation.

V.

Dealing With Tax Collection.

When a taxpayer owes more in tax than he or she can afford to pay, there are only four
options. Each is discussed briefly in turn.
A.

Do Nothing.

A few taxpayers can look the IRS in the eye, not blink, and get away with doing absolutely
nothing to address an unpaid tax. However, these few folks are not necessarily to be envied. They
are truly poor and otherwise collection proof. Taxpayers are collection proof as to the IRS only if
they have no equity in assets and no income. This is not an enviable position - but at least they
needn’t worry about tax collection. This is especially so when one considers that the IRS is not
deterred by ordinary bars to collection that frustrate most creditors. For example, the IRS is not
prohibited from levying social security payments or seizing retirement accounts.
For taxpayers with regular income or equity in assets, doing nothing comes with grave
consequences. Choosing to ignore the IRS will subject the taxpayer to forced collections including
levies, wage garnishments and tax liens.
B.

Installment Plans.

The IRS attempts to direct most taxpayers who can’t pay their tax bill into installment
plans. These are formal agreements between the taxpayer and the IRS under which the taxpayer
makes regular monthly payments and the IRS foregoes other collection activities so long as the
taxpayer makes each payment on time and stays in current tax compliance. Current tax compliance
requires that all subsequent tax returns are filed on time. It also requires that all subsequent tax
liabilities, including required estimated deposits, are paid in full when due. A taxpayer must also
have filed all required returns before the IRS will agree to an installment plan.
Individual taxpayers with a total liability, including penalties and interest, of $50,000 or
less may apply for an installment agreement online. This is referred to as a streamlined installment
agreement and a financial statement is not required.
Taxpayers not qualifying for a streamlined installment agreement may apply for an
agreement by submitting a financial statement (433-F or 433-A for individuals) along with a Form
9465 installment agreement request. It is also possible to contact the IRS by telephone and
negotiate an installment plan. Be prepared, however, to fax the required documents.
Installment plans run until the tax liability is paid in full or until the collections period
expires. The IRS can collect a tax for ten years from the date of assessment but certain activities
can toll the collections period thereby lengthening the time period. In addition, a tax liability can
be reduced to judgment which extends the collections period for an additional ten years.
Practice Tip: Divorcing spouses should enter into separate installment agreements. If one spouse
defaults on a joint installment agreement, the IRS will respond with forced collection against both
spouses.

Page 10 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

C.

Offers in Compromise.

As some radio and late night television commercials loudly proclaim, it is possible to settle
tax debts for pennies on the dollar. This process, referred to by the IRS as an “offer in
compromise”, is a good alternative to those taxpayers that qualify.
When a taxpayer’s reasonable collection potential is less than their full tax liability, the IRS
may agree to a lesser payment. In doing so, the IRS considers a taxpayer’s income, reasonable
expenses (as determined by the IRS), and equity in assets. In essence there are two components,
equity and income, which combine to make up the minimum amount the IRS will settle for. The
initial calculations are made on IRS Form 433-A(OIC).
First, the IRS determines the value which it can recover if the taxpayer’s property were
seized and sold. The fair market value of most property is reduced by 20% to allow for the cost of
seizure and sale. Allowances may be made for payment of income tax incurred on the sale of
capital assets or investment and retirement accounts.
Second, the IRS calculates a taxpayer’s disposable or net monthly income but the expenses
used are generally the national standards, not the taxpayer’s actual expenses (unless the taxpayer’s
expenses are less than national standards). Net monthly income is multiplied by 12 or 24 months
depending on the type of offer submitted to arrive at the income side of the equation.
The offer itself is submitted on IRS Form 656. This form takes the minimum offer
calculated on Form 433-A(OIC) and applies it to a proposal for what are confusingly termed a
“lump sum payment” plan of five or fewer payments in less than one year or a “periodic payment”
plan which may be more than five payments made in less than two years.
The taxpayer must be in current tax compliance before an offer is accepted for review.
Once accepted, the IRS places the taxpayer in a collection hold until the offer is returned, rejected,
or accepted. If the offer is returned, the taxpayer is placed back into collections after 30 days. If the
offer is rejected, the same 30-day collection hold applies; however, within that time the rejection
may be appealed.
An accepted offer places the IRS and the taxpayer into a five-year contract. If the taxpayer
makes the agreed payments, the unpaid tax liability will be discharged - but only if the taxpayer
meets the remaining terms of the contract. One of the most important requirements is that the
taxpayer stays in tax compliance for the five-year term. So long as the taxpayer does not default, at
the end of the term the unpaid liability is discharged. As an added bonus, any recorded tax liens
should be released within a short time after an offer is accepted.
D.

Bankruptcy.

Income tax liabilities may be dischargeable in bankruptcy unless an exception to discharge
applies - and there are many exceptions. Exceptions to discharge include the following:
(a)

A tax for which a fraudulent return was filed;

Page 11 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

(b)
A tax for which a return was required but never filed;
(c)
A tax which the taxpayer willfully attempted to evade or defeat;
(d)
A tax for which a return was due, including extensions, within three years of
the bankruptcy petition date;
(e)
A tax for which the return was filed late and less than two years prior to
filing the bankruptcy case;
(f)
A Tax assessed within the 240 day period before the petition date; and
(g)
An unassessed but assessable tax.
The discharge of tax may not come into play during a divorce proceeding but may become
an issue later. Consider the situation where one spouse agrees to assume a joint and several tax
liability as part of a property settlement - but later discharges the tax in a bankruptcy proceeding.
This creates multiple issues. First, the IRS has no interest in the property settlement. As far as it is
concerned, both spouses are fully liable for the tax regardless what the terms of a divorce decree
state. So, after one spouse discharges the tax liability, the remaining spouse remains liable without
regard to the property settlement.
If the tax is discharged in Chapter 7, the spouse in bankruptcy remains liable to the
non-filing spouse under the terms of the property settlement. This is so because debts to a spouse
or former spouse incurred in the course of a divorce or separation or in connection with a
separation agreement are excepted from discharge, i.e., nondischargeable, in a Chapter 7. As a
result, the debt to the IRS may have been discharged as to the filing spouse, but he or she remains
liable under the divorce decree.
Chapter 13, however, presents a different situation. There, obligations resulting from a
property settlement in a divorce are dischargeable. So if an income tax liability is discharged by
one spouse in Chapter 13, that spouse’s responsibility to pay the joint and several tax liability per
the property settlement provision is also discharged. In contrast, domestic support obligations
remain nondischargeable in Chapter 13.
Practice Tip: An accepted offer in compromise or bankruptcy discharge for one spouse does not
absolve the other spouse from a joint and several tax liability. The IRS will continue its efforts to
collect the entire tax liability (less the amount paid through the offer or bankruptcy) from the other
spouse. Separated or divorced taxpayers need to individually resolve their tax liability.
E.

Uncollectable Status.

The IRS sometimes agrees to place certain taxpayers in uncollectable status, referred to as
“currently not collectible” or “CNC”. To qualify, taxpayers must have little in the way of assets
that the IRS could or would seize, and earn income at or below the amount required to meet their
necessary living expenses (as determined by the IRS). These folks may avoid or defer collections
by completing and providing to the IRS a simplified financial statement referred to as a Form
433-F. If the 433-F shows that the taxpayers cannot currently pay any portion of their tax liability
while meeting their necessary living expenses, the IRS will generally place them in CNC status.
This status can last up to two years, at which time the IRS will require the taxpayers submit new
financials.

Page 12 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

VI.

Relief From Joint and Several Income Tax Liability.
A.

Generally.

Married couples who file a joint income tax return are jointly and severally liable for any
tax due on the return. This is true even if only one spouse earned most or all of the income and
remains so even after a divorce - regardless of any language in the judgment of dissolution. Under
certain conditions, however, a spouse or former spouse may be relieved of a joint and several tax
liability. Four separate types of relief are possible: (1) innocent spouse relief; (2) separation of
liability relief; (3) equitable relief; and injured spouse allocation. The first three types of relief are
explained by IRS Publication 971 and may be applied for on IRS Form 8857. Injured spouse
allocation is applied for on IRS Form 8379 and explained to some extent in the instructions.
B.

Innocent Spouse Relief.

The IRS may release one spouse from a tax liability created primarily by the other spouse
under certain circumstances. If innocent spouse relief is granted, the qualifying spouse is relieved
of all tax, interest, and penalties associated with the other spouse for the tax years at issue.
Although the IRS has discretion to grant this relief, it is often reluctant to do so. Regardless, there
are four conditions, each of which must be met to qualify for innocent spouse relief, as follows:
1.

Joint Return. The spouses must have filed a joint return.

2.
Understated Tax. The return must have shown an understated tax due to an
“erroneous item” of the spouse or former spouse of the taxpayer applying for relief. There is an
understated tax if the IRS determines that the actual tax is greater than the amount shown on the
return. Erroneous items can be unreported income or a deduction, credit, or basis that the IRS
disallows.
3.
Knowledge. The taxpayer must prove that, when he or she signed the joint
return, he or she “did not know and had no reason to know” of the existence or amount of the
understated tax. Knowledge means actual knowledge or if a reasonable person in a similar
circumstance would have known of the understated tax. The IRS considers all of the facts and
circumstances in determining whether a taxpayer had “reason to know” of an understatement.
4.
Unfairness. Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, it
would be unfair to hold the taxpayer liable for the understated tax. The IRS considers all of the
facts and circumstances in determining whether it is unfair to hold a taxpayer liable for an
understated tax. Items considered include: (a) whether the taxpayer received a significant benefit
from the understated tax; (b) whether the spouse or former spouse deserted the taxpayer applying
for relief; and (c) whether the taxpayers are divorced or separated.
If the spouse applying for relief meets these criteria and timely files the request for relief on
IRS Form 8857, the IRS will consider the request. However, be aware that the IRS is required to
contact the non-requesting spouse for information.

Page 13 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

Other circumstances that may be important to the IRS’s consideration are beyond the scope
of this presentation but further information may be found in IRS Publication 971.
C.

Separation of Liability Relief.

If separation of liability relief is granted, the understated tax is allocated between spouses
based on the amount each would be liable for separately. This type of relief is predicated on actual
“knowledge” of the erroneous item and does not include a “reason to know” element. This can be
important to gaining relief, as the IRS nearly always believes that anyone signing a tax return has a
“reason to know” everything stated on the return.
Although the “actual knowledge” element is less onerous, additional conditions are added.
First, the spouse applying for relief must be divorced, legally separated, or not a member of the
same household as the non-requesting spouse for any time during the prior 12 month period.
Second, relief will not be granted if the taxpayers fraudulently transferred assets in an attempt to
avoid paying the tax or a debt owed to a third party. Fortunately, transfers made according to a
divorce decree and transfers not intended to avoid the tax payment do not violate these conditions.
If granted, separation of liability relief allocates to each spouse the tax that each would
have been responsible for had they filed separately. The relief, if granted, extends to penalties and
interest.
D.

Equitable Relief.

Taxpayers not qualifying for innocent spouse relief or separation of liability relief may
nonetheless qualify for “equitable relief” from a joint and several liability. Equitable relief is not
often granted and can be considered something of a last resort. First, the taxpayer applying for
relief must meet initial threshold requirements:
(1)
Not eligible for innocent spouse or separation of liability relief;
(2)
Filed a joint return;
(3)
Timely filed for relief;
(4)
Did not transfer assets as part of a fraudulent scheme or with the primary
purpose of avoiding payment of the tax;
(5)
Did not knowingly file a fraudulent joint tax return; and
(6)
The tax liability is attributable to the taxpayer’s spouse or former spouse.
If these initial threshold requirements are met, the IRS then considers a non-exclusive list
of factors to determine whether relief should be granted, including the following:
(1)
Marital Status. Is the taxpayer divorced, legally separated, a surviving
spouse, or not a member of the same household for the preceding 12 months as the other spouse?
(2)
Economic Hardship. Will the taxpayer suffer economic hardship if relief
is not granted? Economic hardship exists if paying the tax will render the taxpayer unable to meet
his or her “reasonable” basic living expenses. Fair warning, the IRS may have a different view of

Page 14 – TAX ISSUES IN DIVORCE

what your reasonable basic living expenses should be. These expenses are generally referred to as
“National Collection Standards” which are posted on the IRS’s website, irs.gov.
(3)
Knowledge. If the taxpayer did not know or have a reason to know of the
erroneous item, this factor will weigh in favor of relief. If one spouse maintained control of
finances and restricted access of the other spouse to financial information, relief is more likely.
(4)
Unpaid Tax. Did the taxpayer reasonably believe when signing a properly
reported but unpaid tax that the other spouse would pay the liability within a reasonable time? This
factor weighs against relief if the taxpayer should have known the tax would not be paid.
(5)
Reason to Know. The IRS looks at a wide variety of items in determining
whether a taxpayer had reason to know of the understated tax, including the following:
(a)
What is the taxpayer’s level of education?
(b)
Was the spouse or former spouse deceptive or evasive regarding the
couple’s financial matters?
(c)
To what degree was the taxpayer involved in the item creating the
liability?
(d)
To what degree was the taxpayer involved in business or household
financial matters?
(e)
What is the taxpayer’s business and financial education or
experience?
(f)
To what extend did the couple engage in lavish or unusual spending,
especially compared to other years?
(g)
Was the taxpayer abused by his or her spouse, whether physical,
psychological, sexual, or emotional?
(h)
Did one spouse have a legal obligation to pay the liability, such as
pursuant to a divorce decree?
(i)
Did the taxpayer receive a significant financial benefit resulting
from the unpaid liability (such as by participating in a lavish lifestyle)?
(j)
Did the taxpayer make a good faith effort to comply with tax laws in
other years?
(k)
Was or is the taxpayer in poor mental or physical health?
If granted, equitable relief will provide the same relief as innocent spouse relief.
E.

Injured Spouse Allocation.

In addition to relief from joint and several liability relating to a jointly filed tax return, there
is an additional form of relief when a refund from a jointly filed income tax return is kept by the
IRS to pay or offset a past tax liability of only one spouse. Under “injured spouse allocation” a
taxpayer can request that the portion of the refund allocable to his or her income and tax attributes
be returned rather than be retained by the IRS. There are two requirements. First, the tax liability
must belong to only one of the spouses. Second, the non-liable spouse is entitled to only that
portion of the refund which is properly allocable to his or her income and tax attributes.

(10) As used in this section:
(a) “Child-parent relationship” means a relationship that exists or did exist, in whole or in part, within the
six months preceding the filing of an action under this section, and in which relationship a person having
physical custody of a child or residing in the same household as the child supplied, or otherwise made available
to the child, food, clothing, shelter and incidental necessaries and provided the child with necessary care,
education and discipline, and which relationship continued on a day-to-day basis, through interaction,
companionship, interplay and mutuality, that fulfilled the child’s psychological needs for a parent as well as the
child’s physical needs. However, a relationship between a child and a person who is the nonrelated foster parent
of the child is not a child-parent relationship under this section unless the relationship continued over a period
exceeding 12 months.
(b) “Circumstances detrimental to the child” includes but is not limited to circumstances that may cause
psychological, emotional or physical harm to a child.
(c) “Grandparent” means the legal parent of the child’s legal parent.

Mother sought to modify the custody, parenting time, and child support
provisions of a stipulated dissolution judgment granting custody of daughter
to paternal grandmother. The trial court denied mother’s motion, concluding
that mother had failed to prove that a substantial change in circumstances had
occurred since the stipulated dissolution judgment and that modification would
not be in daughter’s best interest. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s
custody ruling, concluding that the trial court did not err in determining that
mother had failed to show a substantial change in circumstances or in determining that modification was not in daughter’s best interest. The court also concluded that the trial court had applied the legal presumption described in Troxel
v. Granville, 530 US 57, 120 S Ct 2054, 147 L Ed 2d 49 (2000) (plurality opinion),
when it entered the stipulated dissolution judgment. The court remanded the
case for the trial court to rule on mother’s request to modify parenting time and
child support. Held: (1) Mother is not entitled to a presumption that her custody
preference is in the child’s best interest, and (2) mother was not prejudiced by the
application of the change-in-circumstances rule to her case.
The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded to

Epler and Epler
BALDWIN, J.

The issues presented in this case are (1) whether
the legal presumption described in Troxel v. Granville, 530
US 57, 120 S Ct 2054, 147 L Ed 2d 49 (2000) (plurality opinion), that a fit parent acts in the best interests of her child,
applies to a modification proceeding in which petitioner
(mother) seeks to modify a stipulated dissolution judgment
that granted legal custody to respondent (grandmother); and
(2) whether mother must demonstrate a substantial change
in circumstances to modify the dissolution judgment. The
trial court denied mother’s motion to modify the judgment
and grant custody to her based on the change-in-circumstances rule and the best interest of the child, and the Court
of Appeals affirmed. Epler and Epler, 258 Or App 464, 466,
309 P3d 1133 (2013).
For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision
of the Court of Appeals, but base our decision on different
reasoning. We conclude that (1) mother is not entitled to the
Troxel presumption that her custody preference is in the
child’s best interest and (2) mother was not prejudiced when
she was held to the substantial change-in-circumstances
rule. Ultimately, we affirm the trial court’s determination
that a modification of the custody provisions of the judgment
is not in the best interest of the child.
Mother requests that we exercise our discretion to
review this case de novo. Assuming arguendo that we have
discretion to consider the matter de novo even though the
Court of Appeals did not, see ORS 19.415(4), we do not find
it necessary to do so: The facts are essentially undisputed.
Accordingly, we limit our review to questions of law. We take
the following facts from the Court of Appeals opinion and
from additional undisputed facts in the record.
Daughter, who was approximately seven years old
at the time of the hearing on mother’s motion, has lived
with her paternal grandmother for her entire life. Mother
and father lived with grandmother in Oregon when daughter was born in 2003. When daughter was approximately
six months old, mother and father separated, father left
Oregon, and mother and daughter continued to live with
grandmother. Three months after the separation, mother

Cite as 356 Or 624 (2014)

627

moved out of grandmother’s residence and left daughter
in grandmother’s sole care. In the months that followed,
mother struggled with depression, started drinking alcohol
heavily, and was unable to maintain steady employment.
Mother then decided to move to Virginia. Before mother
moved, father and grandmother engaged legal counsel, who
prepared a marital settlement agreement.
The marital settlement agreement provided:
“Husband a[n]d Wife acknowledge that Paternal Grandmother * * * has been the primary custodian of [daughter]
since [daughter]’s birth in 2003. Through this agreement,
it is the intention of the parties to formalize Grandmother’s
custody, and provide for both Husband and Wife to pay child
support to Grandmother for [daughter]’s benefit.
“* * * * *
“Husband and Wife desire that paternal grandmother
* * * be awarded sole legal and physical custody of their
minor child, * * * subject to the joint right of both Husband
and Wife to equally share the parenting time provided in
Marion County SLR 8.075 * * *, and with the understanding
that Husband’s parenting time will include Grandmother.”

Mother and father signed the marital settlement agreement
in December 2004, and the trial court entered a stipulated
dissolution judgment based on that agreement in March
2005.
Mother first filed a motion to modify custody in 2006
but voluntarily dismissed that motion. Two years later, in
2008, she filed a second motion to modify custody and, in
the alternative, to modify parenting time and child support.
That 2008 motion is the filing at issue in this case. In her
motion to modify custody, mother argued that she was entitled to a legal presumption that she acted in the best interests of her child. Mother cited ORS 109.119(2)(a) and the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the
United States Constitution to support her motion. After a
hearing, the trial court denied mother’s motion in a letter
opinion. The court found that (1) mother had failed to prove
that a substantial change in circumstances had occurred
since the stipulated dissolution judgment and (2) modification of the dissolution judgment would not be in daughter’s

628

best interest. The court did not address mother’s requests to
modify parenting time or child support.
Mother appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed
the trial court’s custody ruling and remanded for the trial
court to rule on mother’s request to modify parenting time
and child support. Epler, 258 Or App at 466. The Court of
Appeals first concluded that the trial court did not err in
determining that mother had failed to carry her burden of
showing a substantial change in circumstances or in determining that modifying the judgment would not be in daughter’s best interest. Id. at 475-77. The court further concluded
that ORS 109.119 did not apply to this modification proceeding and that “[n]either ORS 109.119(2)(c) nor any other provision of ORS 109.119 makes the presumption in favor of
parents in ORS 109.119(2)(a) applicable to mother’s motion
to modify the stipulated dissolution judgment in this case.”
Id. at 477-78.
The Court of Appeals also rejected mother’s contention that the trial court was required, under Troxel, to
presume that a modification of the custody provision was in
daughter’s best interest. Id. at 478-84. In the court’s view,
the point at which the state “inject[ed] itself into the private
realm of the family,” for Troxel purposes, was when the trial
court entered the parties’ stipulated dissolution judgment.
Id. at 481 (internal quotation marks omitted). At that point,
the Court of Appeals reasoned, the trial court gave mother’s
custodial preference the requisite special weight, thereby
satisfying the requirements of due process. Id. (“That is all
that Troxel requires in this case.”).
Judge Duncan wrote a concurring opinion, in which
she expressed her view that
“(1) mother was required to establish a substantial change
in circumstances in order to have the custody judgment
modified, (2) the trial court did not err in concluding
that mother had failed to establish such a change, and
(3) because mother had failed to establish the requirement for the modification that she requested, we need not
decide whether the trial court was required to presume
that mother’s requested modification was in child’s best
interests.”

Id. at 488 (Duncan, J., concurring).

Judge Egan wrote a dissenting opinion, expressing his view that “the trial court erred by failing to give
special weight to mother’s determination of daughter’s best
interests as required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the
United States Constitution.” Id. at 492 (Egan, J., dissenting). The dissent disagreed with the majority’s determination that the Troxel presumption was applied in mother’s
favor when the parties entered the stipulated dissolution
judgment. The dissent argued that the court should not
conclude that mother was not entitled to the parental presumption because she had voluntarily relinquished custody
of daughter: “To say, under those circumstances, as the
lead opinion does, that that decision permanently rendered
mother an unfit parent—i.e., one who is not entitled to the
Troxel presumption—penalizes mother for a decision that
mother deemed to be in the daughter’s best interests.” Id. at
500.
On review, mother reprises her basic argument that
she is entitled to a Troxel presumption that her custody preference is in daughter’s best interest. She also argues that
requiring her to demonstrate a substantial change in circumstances to regain custody of daughter violates her due
process rights under Troxel. Grandmother, for her part,
contends that Troxel does not apply in this case, because
mother is seeking modification of a judgment with a custody
provision in grandmother’s favor after mother stipulated to
that judgment.
We first address mother’s argument that ORS
109.119 governs this action. Mother concedes that she filed
her motion under ORS 107.135(1)(a), seeking to modify the
custody, parenting time, and child support portions of the
stipulated dissolution judgment. However, she argues that
ORS 109.119 governs all child custody modification proceedings between a parent and a nonparent and therefore applies
to this case. Mother contends that she is entitled to the benefit of the Troxel presumption as codified in that third-party
statute:
“In any proceeding under this section, there is a presumption that the legal parent acts in the best interest of the
child.”

630

Epler and Epler

ORS 109.119(2)(a). We disagree with mother’s contention
that ORS 109.119 governs this action.
Under ORS 109.119(1), a nonparent who has established emotional ties creating a child-parent relationship
with a child “may petition or file a motion for intervention”
seeking custody of the child.1 By its terms, ORS 109.119
applies to actions in which a nonparent initiates or intervenes in proceedings seeking custody. See Burk v. Hall, 186
Or App 113, 120, 62 P3d 394, rev den, 336 Or 16 (2003) (noting that ORS 109.119 “provides substantive requirements for
actions in which a nonparent seeks custody or guardianship
of a minor child over the objection of a legal parent”). The
relief available to a nonparent who initiates an action under
ORS 109.119(1) is a grant of custody to or a determination
of other rights of that nonparent. See ORS 109.119(3)(a).2
In this case, grandmother did not “petition or file a motion
for intervention” seeking custody of daughter. Rather, the
court initially granted custody to grandmother in a dissolution judgment based on the parties’ stipulated agreement. It
is mother who initiated this modification action under ORS
107.135, seeking to regain custody from grandmother. Thus,
ORS 109.119, by its terms, does not apply to this action.
We next examine mother’s contention that her custody preference is nevertheless entitled to “special weight”
under Troxel even if ORS 109.119 does not govern this action.
The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that
parents have a fundamental liberty interest, under the Due
ORS 109.119(1) provides:
“Except as otherwise provided in subsection (9) of this section, any person, including but not limited to a related or nonrelated foster parent, stepparent, grandparent or relative by blood or marriage, who has established
emotional ties creating a child-parent relationship or an ongoing personal
relationship with a child may petition or file a motion for intervention with
the court having jurisdiction over the custody, placement or guardianship of
that child[.]”
2
ORS 109.119(3)(a) provides:
“If the court determines that a child-parent relationship exists and if the
court determines that the presumption described in subsection (2)(a) of this
section has been rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence, the court shall
grant custody, guardianship, right of visitation or other right to the person
having the child-parent relationship, if to do so is in the best interest of the
child.”

Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in the care,
custody, and control of their children. See, e.g., Washington
v. Glucksberg, 521 US 702, 720, 117 S Ct 2258, 138 L Ed
2d 772 (1997) (“In a long line of cases, we have held that,
in addition to the specific freedoms protected by the Bill of
Rights, the ‘liberty’ specially protected by the Due Process
Clause includes the rights * * * to direct the education and
upbringing of one’s children[.]”); Santosky v. Kramer, 455
US 745, 753, 102 S Ct 1388, 71 L Ed 2d 599 (1982) (discussing “[t]he fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in
the care, custody, and management of their child”); Prince
v. Massachusetts, 321 US 158, 166, 64 S Ct 438, 88 L Ed
645 (1944) (“It is cardinal with us that the custody, care
and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose
primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.”).
The Court elaborated on the due process rights of
parents in the plurality opinion of Troxel, 530 US 57. In
Troxel, the grandparents of two children had successfully
petitioned, over the objection of the children’s mother, for
visitation rights under a Washington statute providing that
any person could petition the court for visitation rights. Id.
at 61. The statute allowed the state trial court to order visitation rights in favor of the petitioning party without giving
the mother’s preference any special consideration if it found
that visitation would serve the best interest of the child.
Id.3 Characterizing the statute as “breathtakingly broad,”
the plurality held the statute unconstitutional as applied to
the mother in that case. Id. at 67. The plurality recognized
that fit parents enjoy a presumption that they act in the best
interests of their children. Id. at 68. It did not define “the
precise scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context.” Id. at 73. Rather, the plurality held only that,
when a court reviews a fit parent’s decision with respect to
the care, custody, or control of his or her child, the court is
The statute at issue provided:
“Any person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time
including, but not limited to, custody proceedings. The court may order visitation rights for any person when visitation may serve the best interest of the
child whether or not there has been any change of circumstances.”

required to give at least “some special weight” to the parent’s decision.4 Id. at 70.
In O’Donnell-Lamont and Lamont, 337 Or 86, 91 P3d
721 (2004), cert den, 543 US 1050 (2005), this court “allowed
review of [a] child custody proceeding to consider the appropriate application of changes that the legislature made to
[Oregon’s] third-party custody statute in 2001, following
the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Troxel.” Id.
at 89.5 The grandparents of two children had obtained a
custody award under ORS 109.119, over the objection of the
children’s father. O’Donnell-Lamont, 337 Or at 91-95. On
review, this court analyzed the Supreme Court’s decision
in Troxel, noting that the Court had not precisely “identif[ied] the scope of the parental rights protected by the Due
Process Clause or the showing that the state or a nonparent
must make before a court may interfere with a parent’s custody or control of a child.” Id. at 100. Significantly, this court
stated that the parental presumption recognized in Troxel
is “important, but limited.” Id. at 120. The court concluded
that the father had been afforded his due process rights
under Troxel as codified under ORS 109.119, and affirmed
the judgment of the trial court. Id. at 120-21.
However, as previously explained, ORS 109.119 is
a third-party statute applicable to actions in which a nonparent initiates or intervenes in a proceeding to establish a

Here, the trial court did not make an express or implied finding that mother
is unfit, and grandmother has not taken the position that mother is unfit.

This court described the relationship between Troxel and the statutory
amendments:
“The Supreme Court’s decision in Troxel led directly to the 2001 amendments to Oregon’s statute regulating third-party custody and visitation
claims. As previously discussed, ORS 109.119(3)(a) (1999) allowed a court to
award custody to a psychological parent if the court determined that custody
‘was appropriate in the case’ and was ‘in the best interest of the child.’ That
statute was less ‘open-ended’ than the Washington statute at issue in Troxel,
because it limited the class of third parties who could seek custody or visitation and also because of cases interpreting the statute to impose a presumption in favor of the legal parent. The statute nevertheless appeared likely to
draw a constitutional challenge under Troxel because it failed to assign any
special weight or deference to the legal parent’s interest in the custody and
control of a child. For that reason, the legislature undertook to amend the
statute.”

633

legal relationship with a child. That statute, and the parental presumption embodied in ORS 109.119(2)(a), do not apply
to this proceeding under ORS 107.135(1)(a) where mother
seeks to modify a previous dissolution judgment granting
custody to grandmother. The question, then, is whether
Troxel requires us to give special weight or deference to
mother’s custody preference under the circumstances of this
case. We hold that it does not.
In Troxel, the court recognized a parental presumption where a “breathtakingly broad” visitation statute permitted a state court to order visitation rights to a nonparent
if it found that visitation would serve the best interests of a
child, without any special consideration of the parent’s decision about the child’s best interest. 530 US at 67. The plurality explained that
“so long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children
(i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to
inject itself into the private realm of the family to further
question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent’s children.”

Id. at 68-69. Thus, the presumption recognized in Troxel
was viewed as a protection against the state’s ability to arbitrarily intrude upon the parent-child relationship by ordering visitation rights without giving special weight or deference to a fit parent’s objection to the visitation.
This is not a case where a nonparent has sought to
establish a parent-child relationship or the state has arbitrarily intruded upon such a relationship. Here, mother and
father requested and received court approval of a marital
settlement agreement acknowledging that grandmother
“has been the primary custodian of [daughter] since [her]
birth” and expressing the parents’ desire that grandmother
“be awarded sole legal and physical custody of their minor
child.” The state did not—by way of a third-party statute or
otherwise—inject itself into the private realm of the family
to question that parental decision. The parties abided by the
terms of the stipulated dissolution judgment until mother
initiated this modification proceeding three years later. By
that time, grandmother had been the primary caretaker
of daughter for nearly five years of her life. From the time

634

Epler and Epler

mother moved to Virginia—when daughter was one year
old—until the hearing on mother’s motion, mother had had
visitation with daughter on only five occasions. No visitation had occurred in Virginia, and mother had not visited
with daughter during the year preceding the hearing. Thus,
mother had fostered a limited parental relationship with
daughter. In addition, a parent’s due process rights are not
static and may vary in extent and degree depending on their
exercise. See Lehr v. Robertson, 463 US 248, 259-60, 103 S Ct
2985, 77 L Ed 2d 614 (1983) (noting distinction between “a
mere biological relationship and an actual relationship of
parental responsibility” for due process purposes). Under
the facts of this case, we conclude that mother is not entitled
to the presumption that her current decision that daughter
should return to her custody is in daughter’s best interest.
That does not resolve all of the issues presented in
this case, however. Mother also contends that the trial court
violated her due process rights by requiring her to demonstrate a substantial change in circumstances to regain
custody of her daughter. Mother’s argument is that Troxel
prohibits applying the change-in-circumstances rule here
because its application would impose an undue burden on
her as a parent in seeking to regain custody of her child
from a nonparent.
When a court initially makes a grant of child custody in a dissolution judgment, ORS 107.135 governs any
modification of that custody provision. As relevant here,
ORS 107.135 provides:
“(1) The court may at any time after a judgment of * * *
dissolution of marriage * * * is granted, upon the motion of
either party * * *:
“(a) Set aside, alter or modify any portion of the judgment that provides for * * * the custody, parenting time, visitation, support and welfare of the minor children * * *.”

Generally, a parent seeking modification under ORS 107.135
must show that (1) circumstances relevant to the capacity of
the moving party or the legal custodian to take care of the
child have changed substantially since the original judgment
or the last custody order, and (2) it would be in the child’s
best interest to change custody from the legal custodian to

the moving party. Boldt and Boldt, 344 Or 1, 9, 176 P3d
388, cert den, 555 US 814 (2008); State ex rel Johnson v.
Bail, 325 Or 392, 397, 938 P2d 209 (1997) (tracing origin
of change-in-circumstances rule to this court’s decision in
Merges v. Merges, 94 Or 246, 257-58, 186 P 36 (1919)).6
ORS 107.135 contemplates a mechanism for resolving disputes between two parents relating to their minor
children, providing that a court may modify the custody
portion of a dissolution judgment upon the motion of either
party to the dissolution. ORS 107.135(1)(a). In the typical
situation, one party to the dissolution—a parent—moves
to modify rights vis-à-vis the other party—a parent. Up
to this point, the cases in which Oregon appellate courts
have applied the change-in-circumstances rule under ORS
107.135 have all involved disputes between two parents.
See, e.g., Boldt, 344 Or at 9-10 (applying change-in-circumstances rule in custody modification action between mother
and father); Bail, 325 Or at 399-400 (same); Henrickson v.
Henrickson, 225 Or 398, 402-05, 358 P2d 507 (1961) (same).
The rationale for the judicially created rule is that, unless
the parent seeking a custody change establishes that the
facts that formed the basis for the prior custody determination have changed substantially, the prior custody determination “is preclusive with respect to the issue of the best
interests of the child under the extant facts.” Bail, 325 Or at
398. The main purposes of the rule are “to avoid repeated
litigation over custody and to provide a stable environment
for children.” Ortiz and Ortiz, 310 Or 644, 649, 801 P2d 767
(1990).
6
In determining whether a custody modification would be in a child’s best
interests, a court is required to consider the following factors:
“(a) The emotional ties between the child and other family members;
“(b) The interest of the parties in and attitude toward the child;
“(c) The desirability of continuing an existing relationship;
“(d) The abuse of one parent by the other;
“(e) The preference for the primary caregiver of the child, if the caregiver
is deemed fit by the court; and
“(f) The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the
child.”
ORS 107.137(1).

636

Epler and Epler

Thus, the change-in-circumstances rule is not a
statutory requirement, but rather a judicially created one.
ORS 107.135 does not mandate the application of that rule.
See Bail, 325 Or at 397 (observing that this court first
announced the rule in Merges, 94 Or 246). Because the
change-in-circumstances rule is judicially created, this
court has the authority to determine on prudential grounds
whether to create an exception to the change-in-circumstances rule in fact situations similar to those presented in
this case.
We need not decide in this case, however, whether the
trial court should have applied the change-in-circumstances
rule to mother. In this case, the trial court did not base its
decision to deny mother’s motion for modification solely on
her failure to demonstrate a change in circumstances. After
a hearing on the merits, the trial court considered whether
a change in custody was in the child’s best interest. Indeed,
the trial court clearly considered grandmother’s evidence
compelling in reaching its decision regarding the best interests of the child. Thus, mother was not prejudiced by the
trial court’s determination that she had not demonstrated
a substantial change in circumstances. We therefore do not
find it necessary to address mother’s constitutional challenge to the application of the rule.
Finally, we review the trial court’s determination
that the child’s best interests would not be served by a
change in custody. The standard of review of a trial court’s
best interest determination in a custody modification proceeding is for abuse of discretion. Godfrey v. Godfrey, 228 Or
228, 236, 364 P2d 620 (1961), overruled on other grounds by
Hawkins v. Hawkins, 264 Or 221, 504 P2d 709 (1972). Here,
the trial court found that daughter had lived with grandmother “for the past seven formative years” of her life. As
noted, at the time of hearing, mother had visited daughter a
total of five times. The court found that daughter was wellsettled in her school, and that she had a support network of
friends and members of father’s family in Oregon. The court
also found that daughter is “strongly bonded” to grandmother and that mother’s plan to move daughter to Virginia
would “uproot [daughter] from the only home (Oregon) she
has ever known.”

Cite as 356 Or 624 (2014)

637

In ruling on mother’s motion, the trial court carefully considered the factors listed in ORS 107.137(1), including the emotional ties between daughter and other family
members, the interest of the parties in and attitude toward
the child, the desirability of continuing an existing relationship, and the preference for daughter’s primary caregiver.
See ORS 107.137(1) (listing the factors for courts to consider
to determine the best interests of the child when granting
custody). The court concluded that mother’s motion to modify the dissolution judgment was not in the best interest of
the child, and we affirm that determination.7 Godfrey, 228
Or at 236; see also Bail, 325 Or at 401 (evidence sufficient
to support trial court conclusion that custody modification
decision in child’s best interest). We therefore affirm the
decision of the Court of Appeals as to the custody portion
of mother’s motion to modify the dissolution judgment. We
remand to the trial court for further proceedings regarding mother’s motion to modify that judgment with respect to
parenting time and child support.
The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed in part and
reversed in part, and the case is remanded to the circuit
court to rule on mother’s request to modify parenting time
and child support.

7
In its letter opinion, the trial court encouraged mother to reintegrate herself into daughter’s life and build her relationship with daughter:
“Mother works as a prison guard in Virginia and has held that job since
March 2008. There is no doubt that Mother wants to begin parenting [daughter], but on her own terms. If she relocated, found a job and reintegrated
herself into [daughter]’s life, her chances for modification of the Judgment
would be greatly enhanced.”

INTRODUCTION
Grandparents, foster parents, and other third-parties play an increasing role in the care of
children, statewide and nationally. According to a Pew Research Center analysis of recent US
Census Bureau data, almost 7 million U.S. children live in households with at least one
grandparent. Of this total, 2.9 million (or 41%) were in households where a grandparent was the
primary caregiver, an increase of 16% since 2000. According to the Census Bureau (19%)
percent of these families (551,000 grandparents) fall below the poverty line. There are on
average 8000 children in foster care on any given day in Oregon. The relationship between these
third parties and natural or biological parents has resulted in a significant and evolving body of
case law and statutory changes.
In the seminal case of Troxel v. Granville, 530 US 57, 120 S. Ct. 2054,147 L.Ed 2d 49
(2000), the United States Supreme Court held that awarding visitation to a non-parent, over the
objections of a parent is subject to constitutional limitations. The court invalidated, as applied, a
Washington statute authorizing “any person” to petition for visitation rights “at any time” and
providing that the court may order such visitation if it serves the “best interest of the child,” on the
ground that the statute violates a natural parent’s right to substantive due process. The court
specifically recognized as a fundamental liberty interest, the “interest of parents in the care,
custody and control of their children.” The Troxel case has affected laws in virtually all of the
states, and has significantly reduced previously recognized rights of grandparents, step-parents
and psychological parents in favor of birth parents.
In 2001, Oregon’s legislature responded to Troxel by radically restructuring Oregon’s
psychological parent law (ORS 109.119) and in so doing, eliminated ORS 109.121-123, which
gave specific rights to grandparents.
Before discussing the implications of Troxel and amended ORS 109.119, it is important to
understand Oregon’s law before Troxel.

Grandparent and Psychological Parent Rights in Oregon after Troxel (October 2014)

GRANDPARENT AND THIRD PARTY RIGHTS IN OREGON
BEFORE TROXEL
Before Troxel, Oregon’s jurisprudence evolved from a strict preference in favor of natural
parents to a fairly straight-forward application of the best interests test. In Hruby and Hruby, 304
Or 500 (1987), the Oregon Supreme Court held that the best interest standard is not applicable
in custody disputes between natural parents and other persons, and that in custody disputes, a
natural parent would not be deprived of custody absent “some compelling threat to their present
or future well-being.” That standard remained in place until 1999 when in Sleeper and Sleeper,
328 Or 504 (1999), Hruby was effectively swept aside and the court ordered that the best interest
standard be applied to psychological parent cases. In Sleeper, the stepfather, a primary caretaker,
obtained custody over biological mother. (See also Moore and Moore, 328 Or 513 (1999)).
Significantly, the court limited Sleeper holding, applying the best interests test under the statute,
by making it limited by an undefined “supervening right” of a natural parent. Therefore, before
Troxel, once a third party had met the test for being psychological parent (de facto custodian), the
best interest standard was applied and the psychological parent competed on an equal footing
with the natural parent, subject to the natural parent’s “supervening right.” This “supervening right”
was defined and applied in the post Troxel cases.

TROXEL APPLIED – THE NEW STANDARD
In O’Donnell-Lamont and Lamont, 337 Or 86 (2004), the Supreme Court reversed the
Court of Appeals and restored custody of the children to grandparents. The Supreme Court’s
decision brings some much needed clarity to the application of Troxel as well as the post-Troxel
version of ORS 109.119. Contrary to several prior Court of Appeals decisions, the Supreme Court
held that it is not necessary that a third party overcome the Troxel birth parent presumption by
demonstrating that the birth parent would harm the child or is unable to care for the child. Rather,
the Supreme Court adhered to the legislative standard that “the presumption could be overcome
by a showing, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the parent does not act in the best
interest of the child.” Id. at 107. While a parent’s unfitness or harm to a child can be strong
evidence to overcome the Troxel (and ORS 109.119) birth parent presumption, that presumption
may be rebutted by evidence of any of the enumerated factors as well as other evidence not
specifically encompassed by one of the statutory factors. “The statutory touchstone is whether
the evidence at trial overcomes the presumption that a legal parent acts in the best interest of the
child, not whether the evidence supports one, two, or all five of the non-exclusive factors identified
in ORS 109.119 (4)(b).” Id. at 108.
Notwithstanding this broad and encompassing standard, the more-recent case law
demonstrates that two factors, parental fitness and harm to the child, are by far the most
significant. See also discussion below on “Demonstrating Harm to the Child - What Is Enough?”

Grandparent and Psychological Parent Rights in Oregon after Troxel (October 2014)

DIGEST OF POST-TROXEL CASES IN OREGON
1.
Harrington v. Daum, 172 Or App 188 (2001), CA A108024. Visitation awarded to
deceased mother’s boyfriend over objection of birth father, reversed. After Troxel v. Granville,
application of ORS 109.119 requires that “significant weight” be given to a fit custodial parent’s
decision. The parent’s constitutional right is a supervening right that affects the determination of
whether visitation is appropriate and prevents the application of solely the best interest of the child
standard.
2.
Ring v. Jensen, 172 Or App 624 (2001), CA A105865. Award of grandparent
visitation, reversed. Grandmother’s difficulty in obtaining the amount of visitation desired does not
demonstrate the pattern of denials of reasonable opportunity for contact with the child as required
by ORS 109.121.
3.
Newton v. Thomas, 177 Or App 670 (2001), CA A109008. Interpreting a prior
version of ORS 109.119, the court reversed an award of custody to the grandparents in favor of
the mother. Under ORS 109.119, a court may not grant custody to a person instead of a biological
parent based solely on the court’s determination of what is in the child’s best interest. The court
must give significant weight to the supervening fundamental right of biological parents to the care,
custody and control of their children. In a footnote, the court declined to consider the impact of
the amendments to ORS 109.119 enacted by the 2001 Legislature.
4.
Williamson v. Hunt, 183 Or App 339 (2002), CA A112192. Award of grandparent
visitation reversed. The retroactive provisions of amended ORS 109.119 apply only to cases filed
under the 1999 version of that statute and former ORS 109.121. Parental decisions regarding
grandparent visitation are entitled to “special weight.” Without evidence to overcome the
presumption that a parent’s decision to limit or ban grandparent visitation is not in the best interest
of the child, the trial court errs in ordering such visitation (but see Lamont, Case Note 6).
5.
Wilson and Wilson, 184 Or App 212 (2002), CA A113524. Custody of stepchild
awarded to stepfather, along with parties’ joint child, reversed. Under Troxel, custody of the
mother’s natural child must be awarded to fit birth mother and because of the sibling relationship,
custody of the parties’ joint child must also be awarded to mother. [See Case Note 20 discussion
below for Court of Appeals decision on remand from Supreme Court.]
6.
O’Donnell-Lamont and Lamont, 184 Or App 249 (2002), CA A112960. Custody
of 2 children to maternal grandparents, reversed in favor of birth father (mother deceased). To
overcome the presumption in favor of a biological parent under ORS 109.119(2)(a) (1997), the
court must find by a preponderance of the evidence either that the parent cannot or will not
provide adequate love and care or that the children will face an undue risk of physical or
psychological harm in the parent’s custody. A Petition for Certification of Appeal has been filed
by birth father with the US Supreme Court and is pending at this time. [See discussion at Case
Note 12 for en banc decision and discussion above, and Case Note 16 below for Supreme Court
decision.]

Moran v. Weldon, 184 Or App 269 (2002), CA A116453. Troxel applied to an
adoption case. Adoption reversed where father’s consent was waived exclusively based upon the
incarceration provisions of ORS 109.322. Troxel requires that birth father’s consent may not be
waived without “proof of some additional statutory ground for terminating parental rights***.”
8.
State v. Wooden, 184 Or App 537, 552 (2002), CA A111860. Oregon Court of
Appeals, October 30, 2002. Custody of child to maternal grandparents, reversed in favor of father
(mother murdered). A legal parent cannot avail himself of the “supervening right to a privileged
position” in the decision to grant custody to grandparents merely because he is the child’s
biological father. Father may be entitled to assert parental rights if he grasps the opportunity and
accepts some measure of responsibility for the child’s future. To overcome presumption in favor
of father, caregiver grandparents must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that father
cannot or will not provide adequate love and care for the child or that moving child to father’s
custody would cause undue physical or psychological harm. Rather than order an immediate
transfer, the court ordered that birth father be entitled to custody following a 6-month transition
period. [See also Case Note 20, Dennis, for an example of another transition period ordered.]
9.
Strome and Strome, 185 Or App 525 (2003), rev. allowed, 337 Or 555 (2004), CA
A111369. Custody of 3 children to paternal grandmother reversed in favor of birth father. The
Court of Appeals ruled that where the biological father had physical custody for 10 months before
trial, and had not been shown to be unfit during that time, Grandmother failed to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that father cannot or will not provide adequate love and care for
the children or that placement in his custody will cause an undue risk of physical or psychological
harm, in spite of father’s past unfitness. [See discussion below Case Note 22 for Court of Appeals
decision on remand from Supreme Court.]
10.
Austin and Austin,185 Or App 720 (2003), CA A113121. In the first case applying
revised ORS 109.119 and, in the first case since Troxel, the Court of Appeals awarded custody
to a third party (step-parent) over the objection of a birth parent (mother). The constitutionality
of the revised statute was not raised before the court. The court found specific evidence to show
that mother was unable to adequately care for her son. The case is extremely fact specific.
Father had been awarded custody of three children, two of whom were joint children. The third
child at issue in the case, was mother’s son from a previous relationship. Therefore, sibling
attachment as well as birth parent fitness were crucial to the court’s decision. Petition for Review
was filed in the Supreme Court and review was denied [337 Or 327 (2004)].
11.
Burk v. Hall, 186 Or App 113 (2003), CA A112154. Revised ORS 109.119 and
Troxel applied in the guardianship context. In reversing a guardianship order the court held that:
“***guardianship actions involving a child who is not subject to court’s juvenile dependency
jurisdiction and whose legal parent objects to the appointment of guardian are – in addition to the
requirements of ORS 125.305 – subject to the requirements of ORS 109.119.” The
constitutionality of amended ORS 109.119 was not challenged and therefore not addressed by
this court.

O’Donnell-Lamont and Lamont, 187 Or App 14 (2003) (en banc), CA A112960.
The en banc court allowed reconsideration and held that the amended psychological parent law
[ORS 109.119 (2001)] was retroactively applicable to all petitions filed before the effective date
of the statute. The decision reversing the custody award to grandparent and awarding custody
to father was affirmed. Although 6 members of the court appeared to agree that the litigants were
denied the “***fair opportunity to develop the record because the governing legal standards have
changed***,” a remand to the trial court to apply the new standard was denied by a 5 to 5 tie vote.
[See discussion at Case Note 6 and Case Note 16 for Supreme Court decision.]
13.
Winczewski and Winczewski, 188 Or App 667 (2003), rev. den. 337 Or 327
(2004), CA A112079. [Please note that the Winczewski case was issued before the Supreme
Court’s decision in Lamont.] The en banc Court of Appeals split 5 to 5 and in doing so, affirmed
the trial court’s decision, awarding custody of two children to paternal grandparents over the
objection of birth mother, and where birth father was deceased. For the first time, ORS 109.119
(2001) was deemed constitutional as applied by a majority of the members of the court, albeit with
different rationales. Birth mother’s Petition for Review was denied by the Supreme Court.
14.
Sears v. Sears & Boswell, 190 Or App 483 (2003), rev. granted on remand, 337
Or 555 (2004), CA A117631. The court reversed the trial court’s order of custody to paternal
grandparents and ordered custody to mother where the grandparents failed to rebut the statutory
presumption that mother acted in the best interests of a 4-year old child. Mother prevailed over
grandparents, notwithstanding the fact that grandparents were the child’s primary caretakers since
the child was 8 months old, and that mother had fostered and encouraged that relationship. Sears
makes it clear that the birth parent’s past history and conduct are not controlling. Rather, it is birth
parent’s present ability to parent which is the pre-dominate issue. [See Case Note 19 for decision
on remand.]
15.
Wurtele v. Blevins, 192 Or App 131 (2004), rev. den., 337 Or 555 (2004), CA
A115793. Trial court’s custody order to maternal grandparents over birth father’s objections. A
custody evaluation recommended maternal grandparents over birth father. The court found
compelling circumstances in that if birth father was granted custody, he would deny contact
between the child and grandparents, causing her psychological harm, including threatening to
relocate with the child out-of-state.
16.
O’Donnell-Lamont and Lamont, 337 Or 86, 91 P3d 721 (2004), cert. den., 199
OR App 90 (2005), 125 S Ct 867 (2005), CA A112960. The Oregon Supreme Court reversed the
Court of Appeals and restored custody of the children to grandparents. Contrary to several prior
Court of Appeals decisions, the Supreme Court held that it is not necessary that a third party
overcome the Troxel birth parent presumption by demonstrating that the birth parent would harm
the child or is unable to care for the child. Rather, the Supreme Court adhered to the legislative
standard that “the presumption could be overcome by a showing, based on a preponderance of
the evidence, that the parent does not act in the best interest of the child.” Id. at 107. While a
parent’s unfitness or harm to a child can be strong evidence to overcome the Troxel (and ORS
109.119) birth parent presumption, that presumption may be rebutted by evidence of any of the
enumerated factors as well as other evidence not specifically encompassed by one of the
Page - 5

Grandparent and Psychological Parent Rights in Oregon after Troxel (October 2014)

statutory factors. “The statutory touchstone is whether the evidence at trial overcomes the
presumption that a legal parent acts in the best interest of the child, not whether the evidence
supports one, two, or all five of the non-exclusive factors identified in ORS 109.119(4)(b).”
17.
Meader v. Meader, 194 Or App 31 (2004), CA A120628. Grandparents had
previously been awarded visitation of two overnight visits per month with three grandchildren and
the trial court’s original decision appeared to be primarily based upon the best interests of the
children and the original ruling was considered without application of the Troxel birth parent
presumption. After the Judgment, birth parents relocated to Wyoming and grandparents sought
to hold parents in contempt. Parents then moved to terminate grandparents’ visitation. At the
modification hearing, before a different trial court judge, parents modification motion was denied
on the basis that birth parents had demonstrated no “substantial change of circumstances.” Id.
at 40.
The Court of Appeals reversed and terminated grandparents’ visitation rights. The
court specifically found that in a modification proceeding no substantial change of circumstances
was required. Id. at 45. Rather, the same standard applied a parent versus parent case [see
Ortiz and Ortiz, 310 Or 644 (1990)] was applicable, that is the best interest of the child. The
evidence before the modification court included unrebutted expert testimony that the child’s
relationship with grandmother was “very toxic; that the child did not feel safe with grandmother;
that the child’s visitation with grandmother was a threat to her relationship with Mother and that
such dynamic caused the child to develop PTSD.” The court also found “persuasive evidence”
that the three children were showing signs of distress related to the visitation.
18.
Van Driesche and Van Driesche, 194 Or App 475 (2004), CA A118214. The trial
court had awarded substantial parenting time to step-father over birth mother’s objections. The
Court of Appeals reversed finding that the step-parent did not overcome the birth parent
presumption. This was the first post - Lamont (Supreme Court) case. Although mother had
encouraged the relationship with step-father while they were living together, and although such
evidence constituted a rebuttal factor under ORS 109.119, this was not enough. The court found
that such factor may be given “little weight” when the birth parent’s facilitation of the third-party’s
contact was originally in the best interest of the child but was no longer in the best interest of the
child after the parties’ separation. Step-father contended that the denial of visitation would harm
the children but presented no expert testimony.
19.
Sears v. Sears & Boswell, 198 Or App 377 (2005), CA A117631. The Court of
Appeals, after remand by the Supreme Court to consider the case in light of Lamont [Case Note
16], adheres to its original decision reversing the trial court’s order of custody to maternal
grandparents and ordering custody to birth mother. Looking at each of the five rebuttal factors
as well as under the “totality of the circumstances”, birth mother prevailed again. Grandparents’
strongest factor, that they had been the child’s primary caretaker for almost two years before the
custody hearing, was insufficient. Specifically, grandparents did not show birth mother to be unfit
at the time of trial, or to pose a serious present risk of harm to the child.

20.
Dennis and Dennis, 199 Or App 90 (2005), CA A121938. The trial court had
awarded custody of father’s two children to maternal grandmother. Based upon ORS 109.119
(2001) and Lamont, the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that grandmother did not rebut the
statutory presumption that birth father acts in the best interest of the children. The case was
unusual in that there was apparently no evidentiary hearing. Rather, the parties stipulated that
the court would consider only the custody evaluator’s written report (in favor of grandmother) and
birth father’s trial memorandum, in making its ruling on custody. Birth father prevailed
notwithstanding the fact that he was a felon, committed domestic violence toward birth mother,
and used illegal drugs. However, birth father rehabilitated himself and re-established his
relationship with his children. Although grandmother had established a psychological parent
relationship and had been the long-term primary caretaker of the children, she was not able to
demonstrate that birth father’s parenting at the time of trial was deficient or inadequate; nor was
grandmother able to demonstrate that a transfer of custody to birth father would pose a present
serious risk of harm to the children as grandmother’s concerns focused of birth father’s past
behaviors. The case continued the Court of Appeals trend in looking at the present circumstances
of the birth parent rather than extenuating the past deficiencies. The case is also significant in
that rather than immediately transferring custody of the children to birth father, and because birth
father did not request an immediate transfer, the case was remanded to the trial court to develop
a transition plan and to determine appropriate parenting time for grandmother. Birth father’s
request for a “go slow” approach apparently made a significant positive impression with the court.
[See also Case Note 8, State v. Wooden, for an example of another transition plan.]
21.
Wilson and Wilson [see Case Note 5 above]. Birth father’s Petition for Review was
granted [337 Or 327 (2004)] and remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of
Lamont. On remand [199 Or App 242 (2005)], the court upheld its original decision, which found
both parties to be fit. Birth father failed to overcome the presumption that birth mother does not
act in the best interest of birth mother’s natural child/father’s stepchild; therefore, for the same
reasons as the original opinion, custody of the party’s joint child must also be awarded to birth
mother.
22.
Strome and Strome, 201 Or App 625 (2005). On remand from Supreme Court to
reconsider earlier decision in light of Lamont, the court affirms its prior decision (reversing the trial
court) and awarding custody of the 3 children to birth father, who the trial court had awarded to
paternal grandmother. Although birth father had demonstrated a prior interference with the
grandparent-child relationship, the rebuttal factors favored birth father. The court particularly
focused on the 10 months before trial where birth father’s parenting was “exemplary.” Because
the children had remained in the physical custody of grandmother for the many years of litigation,
the case was remanded to the trial court to devise a plan to transition custody to father and retain
“ample contact” for grandmother. [See Case Note 9 above.]

Poet v. Thompson, 208 Or App 442 (2006), CA A129220. Rulings made resulting
from a pre-trial hearing to address issues of temporary visitation or custody under ORS 109.119,
are not binding on the trial judge as the “law of the case.” A party who does not establish an
“ongoing personal relationship” or “psychological parent relationship” in such a hearing may
attempt to establish such relationships at trial notwithstanding their failure to do so at the pre-trial
hearing. Note the procedures and burdens to establish temporary visitation or custody or a
temporary protective order or restraint are not established by statute or case law.
24.
Jensen v. Bevard and Jones, 215 Or App 215 (2007), CA A129611. The trial court
granted grandmother custody of a minor child based upon a “child-parent relationship” in which
grandmother cared for the child on many, but not all, weekends when mother was working. The
Court of Appeals reversed, finding that grandmother’s relationship did not amount to a “childparent” relationship under ORS 109.119 and therefore, was not entitled to custody of the child.
Mother and grandmother did not reside in the same home.
Practice Note:

It is unclear in this case whether grandmother also sought visitation based
upon an “ongoing personal relationship.” [ORS 109.119(10)(e)]. If she had,
she may have been entitled to visitation but would have had to prove her
case by a clear and convincing standard. Where a third-party’s “child-parent”
relationship is not absolutely clear, it is best to alternatively plead for relief
under the “ongoing personal relationship,” which is limited to visitation and
contact only.

25.
Muhlheim v. Armstrong, 217 Or App 275 (2007), CA A129926 and A129927. The
Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s award of custody of a child to maternal grandparents.
The child had been in an unstable relationship with mother and the child was placed with
grandparents by the Department of Human Services (DHS). Although father had only a marginal
relationship with the child, the court nevertheless ruled that he was entitled to custody, because
the grandparents had not sufficiently rebutted the parental presumption factors set forth in ORS
119.119(4)(b). Grandparents had only been primary caretakers for 5 months proceeding the trial.
Father had a criminal substance abuse history but “not so extensive or egregious to suggest that
he is currently unable to be an adequate parent.” While stability with grandparents was important
and an expert had testified that removal of the child would “cause significant disruption to her
development,” those factors did not amount to “a serious present risk of psychological, emotional,
or physical harm to the child.” As in Strome (Case Note 22 above), the court directed the trial
court to establish a transition plan to transfer custody to father and preserve ample contact
between the child and her relatives.
Practice Note:

Page - 8

This case follows the general trend of preferring the birth parent over the third-party,
and the downplaying of issues related to a birth parent’s prior history, lack of
contact, and disruption to the stability of the child. It may have been important in
this case that grandparents hired a psychologist to evaluate their relationship, but
the psychologist never met with father, nor was a parent-child observation
performed.

26.
Middleton v. Department of Human Services, 219 Or App 458 (2008), CA
A135488. This case arose out of a dispute over the placement of a child between his long-term
foster family and his great aunt from North Dakota, who sought to adopt him. DHS recommended
that the child be adopted by his foster parents. The relatives challenged the decision
administratively and then to the trial court under the Oregon Administrative Procedures Act (APA)
(ORS 183.484). The trial court set aside the DHS decision, preferring adoption by the relatives.
On appeal, the case was reversed and DHS’s original decision in favor of the foster parent
adoption was upheld. The court emphasized that its ruling was based upon the limited authority
granted to it under the Oregon APA, and this was not a “best interest” determination. Rather,
DHS had followed its rules, the rules were not unconstitutional, and substantial evidence in the
record supported the agency decision. Since substantial evidence supported placement with
either party, under the Oregon APA the court was not authorized to substitute its judgment and
set aside the DHS determination.
27.
Nguyen and Nguyen, 226 Or App 183 (2009), CA A138531. Following the trend
in recent cases, an award of custody to maternal grandparents was reversed and custody was
awarded to birth mother. Mother had been the primary caretaker of the minor child (age 7 at the
time of trial) but became involved in a cycle of domestic violence between herself, the child’s
father, and others; residential instability, and drug use. Mother also had some mental health
issues in the past. At trial, the custody evaluator testified that mother was not fit to be awarded
custody at the time of trial, but could be fit if she could make “necessary changes and provide
stability and consistency ***.” As to parental fitness, the most important issue according to the
court, was that mother’s history did not make her presently unable to care adequately for the
child. As to the harm to the child element, the court repeated its past admonition that the
evidence must show a “serious present risk” of harm. It is insufficient to show “***that living with
a legal parent may cause such harm.” As in Strome (Case Note 22), the court directed the trial
court to establish an appropriate transition plan because of the child’s long-term history with
grandparents.
28.
Hanson-Parmer, aka West and Parmer, 233 Or App 187 (2010), CA A133335.
The trial court determined that husband was the psychological parent of her younger son, and is
therefore entitled to visitation with him pursuant to ORS 109.119(3)(a). Husband is not biological
father. On appeal, the dispositive legal issue was whether husband had a "child-parent
relationship." ORS 109.119(10)(a) is a necessary statutory prerequisite to husband's right to
visitation in this case. Held: Husband's two days of "parenting time" each week is insufficient to
establish that husband "resid[ed] in the same household" with child "on a day-to-day basis"
pursuant to ORS 109.119(10)(a). Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment
including a finding that husband is not the psychological parent of child and is not entitled to
parenting time or visitation with child; otherwise affirmed. See Jensen v. Bevard (Case No. 24).
29.
DHS v. Three Affiliated Tribes of Port Berthold Reservation, 236 Or App 535
(2010), CA A143921. In a custody dispute under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) between
long-term foster parents and a relative family favored by the tribe of two Indian children, the Court
of Appeals found good cause to affirm the trial court’s maintaining the children’s placement with
foster parents. Although this was not an ORS 109.119 psychological parent case, it contains
interesting parallels. Under the ICWA, applicable to Indian children, the preference of the tribe
for placements outside the biological parent’s home, is to be honored absent good cause.
Page - 9

Grandparent and Psychological Parent Rights in Oregon after Troxel (October 2014)

Although the ICWA does not define the term “good cause”, the trial court concluded that it
“properly and necessarily includes circumstances in which an Indian child will suffer serious and
irreparable injury as a result of the change in placement.” The Court of Appeals agreed with the
trial court that good cause existed based upon persuasive expert testimony that “the harm to [the
children] will be serious and lasting, if they are moved from [foster parents’] home.” This analysis
has its parallel in the ORS 109.119 rebuttal factor which provides for custody to a third-party if
a child would be “psychologically, emotionally, or physically harmed” if relief was not ordered. It
also parallels the Supreme Court’s analysis of the ORS 109.119 harm standard, as requiring proof
of circumstances that pose “a serious risk of psychological, emotional, or physical harm to the
child.” This case points to the necessity of expert testimony to support a third-party when they are
seeking to obtain custody from a biological parent. See Lamont decision (Case Note 16).
30.
Digby and Meshishnek, 241 Or App 10 (2011), CA A139448. Former foster parent
(FFP) sought third-party visitation from adoptive parents. FFP had last contact with children in
July 2005 and filed an action under ORS 109.119 in June 2007, pleading only a “child-parent
relationship” and not an “ongoing personal relationship.” Trial court allowed FFP visitation rights.
Court of Appeals reversed finding that FFP did not have a “child-parent relationship” within 6
months preceding the filing of the petition and because FFP did not plead or litigate an “ongoing
personal relationship.” Lesson: Plead and prove the correct statutory relationship (or both if the
facts demonstrate both).
31.
G.J.L. v. A.K.L., 244 Or App 523 (2011), CA A143417 (Petition for Review Denied).
Grandparents were foster parents of grandson for most of his first 3 years of life. After DHS
returned child to birth parents and wardship was terminated, parents cut off all contact with
grandparents. Trial court found that grandparents had established a grandparent-child relationship
and that continuing the relationship between them and child would be positive. Trial court denied
Petition for Visitation because of the “significant unhealthy relationship” between grandparents
and mother. No expert testimony was presented at trial. On appeal, the Court found that
grandparents had prevailed on three statutory rebuttal factors (recent primary caretaker; prior
encouragement by birth parents; and current denial of contact by parents). However, the Court
of Appeals denied relief because grandparents failed to prove a “serious present risk of harm” to
the child from losing his relationship with grandparents, and that grandparents’ proposed visitation
plan (49 days per year) “would substantially interfere with the custodial relationship.” A Petition
for Review was denied.
32.
In the Matter of M.D., a Child, Dept. Of Human Services v. J.N., 253 Or App 494
(2012), CA A150405. (Juvenile Court) The court did not err in denying father’s motion to dismiss
jurisdiction given that the combination of child’s particular needs created a likelihood of harm to
child’s welfare. However, the court erred by changing the permanency plan to guardianship
because there was no evidence in the record to support the basis of that decision- that the child
could not be reunified with father within a reasonable time because reunification would cause
“severe mental and emotional harm” to child. The “severe mental and emotional harm” standard
parallels to the Oregon Supreme Court’s analysis of the ORS 109.119 harm standard, as requiring
proof of circumstances that pose a “serious risk of psychological, emotional, or physical harm to
the child.” See Lamont decision [Case No. 16].

In the Matter of R.J.T., a Minor Child, Garner v. Taylor, 254 Or App 635 (2013),
CA A144896). Non-bio parent obtained an ORS 109.119 judgment by default against child’s
mother for visitation rights with child. Later mother sought to set aside the default which was
denied. Non bio parent later filed an enforcement action and also sought to modify the judgment
seeking custody. The trial court set aside the original judgment, finding that non bio parent did
not originally have a “child-parent” or “ongoing personal” relationship to sustain the original
judgment; if she did have such a relationship, she could not rebut the birth parent presumption;
and finally, that even if the birth parent presumption was rebutted, that visitation between non bio
parent and the child was not in the child’s best interest. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed
the trial court for setting aside the original judgment sua sponte, finding no extraordinary
circumstances pursuant to ORCP 71C. The Court of Appeals bypassed the issue as to whether
there was originally an ongoing personal relationship with the child and originally whether the birth
parent presumption had been rebutted. Instead, it simply upheld the trial court, finding that
visitation should be denied because it was not in the child’s best interests. Since this was not a
de novo review, the court did not explain why visitation was not in the best interests of the child,
but it would appear that the continuing contentious relationship between the parties was a
significant factor.
34.
Underwood et al and Mallory, nka Scott, 255 Or App 183 (2013), CA A144622.
Grandparents obtained custody of child by default. Although certain ORS 109.119 rebuttal factors
were alleged, the judgment granting custody to Grandparents was pursuant to ORS 109.103.
Mother later filed a motion to modify the original judgment citing ORS 107.135 and ORS 109.103,
but not ORS 109.119. In response, Grandparents contended that Mother did not satisfy the
“substantial change of circumstances” test, governing ORS 107.135 modifications. The trial court
and the Court of Appeals agreed. The Court of Appeals also noted with approval the trial court’s
finding that a change of custody would not be in the child’s best interest, noting in particular that
Grandparents had been the primary caretaker of the child for the past 10 years and facilitated
(until recently) ongoing relationships between the child, his siblings, and mother. Because the
case had originally been filed (apparently erroneously) under ORS 109.103, the Court of Appeals
avoided “the complex and difficult question *** as to whether the provision of ORS 109.119(2)(c)
that removes the presumption from modification proceedings would be constitutional as applied
to a circumstance where no determination as to parental unfitness was made at the time the court
granted custody to grandparents.” Accordingly, where a custody or visitation judgment is obtained
originally by default without a specific finding that the birth parent presumption had been
overcome, it is unclear as to whether such presumption, under the United States Constitution,
needs to be rebutted in modification or other subsequent proceedings.
35.
Dept. of Human Services v. S.M., 256 Or App 15 (2013), CA A151376. This is a
juvenile court case holding a trial court’s order allowing children, as wards of the court, to be
immunized pursuant to legal advice but over mother and father’s religious objections. There is
an insightful discussion of Troxel v. Granville at pp 25-31. The court found that the immunization
order did not violate Troxel or the constitutional right of parents to “direct the upbringing of their
children,” but noted the possibility that certain state decisions might run afoul of constitutional
rights. This case strongly suggests that legal parents may be fit in certain spheres of parenting,
but unfit as to others. (Oregon Supreme Court review pending.)

Dept. Of Human Services v. L. F., 256 Or App 114 (2013), CA A152179. This is
a fairly standard juvenile court case where the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court’s finding of
jurisdiction as to mother. As applied to ORS 109.119 litigation, the court’s holding as follows may
be relevant to the rebuttal factor relating to parental fitness and harm to the child. Noting that
child, L.F., had “*** severe impairments of expressive and receptive language,” the Court of
Appeals agreed with the trial court that “*** mother’s inability or unwillingness to meet [child’s]
medical and developmental needs of [child] to a threat of harm or neglect. *** [Child’s]
development and welfare would be injured if mother were responsible for his care because she
does not understand how to meet his special needs. Without the ability to understand and meet
[child’s] developmental and medical needs, it is reasonably likely that mother’s care would hinder
[child’s] development and fall short of satisfying his medical needs.” Id. at 121-122.
37.
Kleinsasser v. Lopes, 265 Or App 195, 333 P3d 1239 (2014). In a marked
departure from recent trends, the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court’s judgment awarding
custody of a child to Stepmother over the objections of biological Mother, where Father had died.
Child had resided with Father and Stepmother for the prior four years. Mother had been in and
out of Oregon and had not been active in the child’s life until after Father’s death. In contrast to
a more rigid focus on the "parental fitness" and "harm to child" factors in prior cases, and although
this was not a de novo review case, the Court of Appeals assessed all of the ORS 109.119
rebuttal factors and agreed with the trial court’s findings that Stepmother satisfied the rebuttal
factors except one. As to the parental fitness factor, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial
court finding as to mother's past absenteeism as it related to her parental fitness. Consistent with
prior rulings, it is the birth parent’s present state of fitness, as of the date of the trial, that is most
important. The trial court noted Mother’s attitudes and conduct toward the child-Stepmother
relationship which reflected poorly on her understanding of the child’s best interests.
38.
Epler and Epler and Graunitz, 258 Or App 464 (2013), (Court of Appeals); 356 Or
634 (2014) (Supreme Court). In the underlying divorce between Mother and Father, both parents
stipulated that paternal Grandmother have custody of granddaughter. Grandmother had custody
for most of the child’s life, including the 5 years prior to Mother’s modification motion. Mother
filed to modify custody and argued that she was entitled to the Troxel /ORS 109.119 birth parent
presumption. The trial court denied Mother’s motion finding she had failed to prove a “change
of circumstances” and that even if she had, the best interests of the child required that
Grandmother retain custody. Mother appealed and the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court
finding:
•

When a biological parent stipulates to custody to a third-party in a ORS Chapter 107
proceeding and then seeks to modify such judgment, ORS 107.135 applies and
such parent will be required to demonstrate a substantial change of circumstances.
Such stipulation serves as a rebuttal to the Troxel presumption.

•

ORS 107.135 does not expressly apply to modification proceedings in ORS 109.119
actions; rather ORCP 71C and the court’s inherent authority applies. The Troxel
presumption does not apply to ORS 109.119 modifications.

•

The parental fitness standard in Troxel third-party cases is broader than the parental
fitness standard in ORS Chapter 419B juvenile court termination cases (and
presumably broader than such fitness standard in ORS Chapter 419B juvenile court
dependency cases).

Grandparent and Psychological Parent Rights in Oregon after Troxel (October 2014)

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, but for different reasons, finding:
•

Because the custody to Grandmother was pursuant to a Chapter 107 dissolution
proceeding that this case is not governed by the psychological parent statute ORS
109.119, but rather the modification statute, ORS 107.135.

•

”Mother is not entitled to the Troxel presumption that her custody preference is in
the child’s best interest (at least as to the facts of this case) and

•

Mother was not prejudiced when she was held to the substantial change-incircumstances rule.”

•

Because the trial court found properly that it was not in the child’s best interests
that custody be changed, the Supreme Court did not address Mother’s argument
that the application of the change of circumstances rule unduly burdened her
due process rights under Troxel.

39.

Department of Human Services v. A.L., 268 Or App 391, 400 (2015). Parents

successfully challenged the juvenile court’s jurisdiction where, among other things, they had
placed their children with paternal grandparents. “Because parents have entrusted their
children to paternal grandparents who pose no a current threat of harm, the court did not have
a basis for asserting jurisdiction over the children.” A parent’s inability to parent independently
does not amount to a condition “seriously detrimental to the child,” when such child is placed
in a safe alternative placement. See also, Matter of NB, 271Or App 354 (2015) - another
juvenile court case in which juvenile court jurisdiction of a child was based in part by the
parents’ delegation/transfer of care to third parties (grandparents). Construing ORS
419B.100(2), the Court held that the fact of the delegation could indeed be a factor in
determining whether juvenile court jurisdiction was appropriate, but the delegation per se was
not sufficient. Rather the inquiry would have to be case specific and address particular facts,
for example whether the child was exposed to risks of the parent(s) while in the third party’s
care. In the NB case, DHS didn’t meet the burden to demonstrate such risks.

DEMONSTRATING HARM TO THE CHILD - WHAT IS ENOUGH?
Query: Is the court expecting empirical or objective evidence that a transfer to a birth
parent’s full custody from a psychological parent would cause psychological harm to a child?
How does one establish such evidence? Perhaps, some children may have to actually suffer
psychological harm to form an empirical base. If a child is psychologically harmed as a result
of the transition, does this constitute grounds for a modification? How long does one have to
wait to assess whether psychological harm is being done - 6 months? One year? Some
guidance is offered from the following cases.
Page - 13

Grandparent and Psychological Parent Rights in Oregon after Troxel (October 2014)

Although Amended ORS 109.119 provides that the natural parent presumption may be
rebutted if “circumstances detrimental to the child exists if relief is denied,” summary evidence
that a child would be harmed through a transition to the custodial parent will not be adequate.
In State v. Wooden [Case Note 8], the testimony of noted child psychologist Tom Moran, that
moving the child now “would be devastating and traumatic” was not sufficient. The court was
critical as to the narrow scope of Dr. Moran’s analysis - he did not perform a traditional custody
evaluation “instead, he offered an opinion - - based solely on his limited contact with the child - on the narrow issue of the probable effect of awarding custody ‘right now’.” Moran was also
rebutted by Dr. Jean Furchner, who recommended that custody be awarded to father after a
transition period of between 6 to 12 months.
In the Strome case [Case Note 9], the court majority discounted the testimony of Dr.
Bolstad (who, in contrast to Dr. Moran in Wooden, did a comprehensive evaluation including
mental health testing) that found the children to be “significantly at risk.” The majority
preferred the testimony of evaluator Mazza who evaluated Father and the children only, albeit
in a more intensive fashion. Strome reversed the trial court and awarded custody to father
drawing a dissent of 4 members of the court.
Five members of the Winczewski court [Case Note 13], agreed that the facts
demonstrated that birth mother was unable to care adequately for the children and that the
children would be harmed if grandparent’s were denied custody. That decision relied in part
on the opinion of custody evaluator Dr. Charlene Sabin, whose report contained extensive
references to mother’s inability to understand the needs of the children; her unwillingness to
accept responsibility for the children’s difficulties and her very limited ability to distinguish
between helpful and harmful conduct for the children. Viewing the same evidence through a
different prism, Judge Edmonds and 4 members of the court determined that such evidence
was inadequate to meet the constitutional standard. Judge Schuman and Judge Armstrong
would have required evidence “far, far more serious” than presented to deny mother custody.
In the Supreme Court’s Lamont decision [Case Note 16], the court specifically
interpreted the “harm to child” rebuttal factor, ORS 109.119(4)(a)(B). Although the statutory
language appeared to include a “may cause harm” standard, the Supreme Court adopted a
limiting construction finding that “circumstances detrimental to the child” (ORS
109.119(4)(a)(B) “***refers to circumstances that pose a serious present risk of
psychological, emotional, or physical harm to the child.” The use of the reference to “serious
present risk” is significant. The court specifically rejected an interpretation that the birth parent
presumption could be overcome merely by showing that custody to the legal parent “may”
cause harm. Id. at 112-113. While helpful, this does not end the analysis. Although the
harm may occur in the future, arguably an expert can testify that a transfer of custody to a birth
parent presents a serious present risk of harm even though the actual harm may occur in the
future. Regardless of how one articulates the standard, it is clear from Lamont and Van
Driesche [Case Note 18] that expert testimony will be required to demonstrate harm to the
child and likely be necessary in order to demonstrate deficits or incapacity of a parent.
The trend in recent cases is to focus on the current, not past, parenting strengths and
weaknesses of the birth parent, particularly where the birth parent has made a substantial
effort at rehabilitation or recovery. Recent cases also suggest that the importance of
Page - 14

Grandparent and Psychological Parent Rights in Oregon after Troxel (October 2014)

preserving the stability achieved with a third-party and avoiding the trauma due to a change of
custody may not be sufficient to meet the “serious present risk of harm” standard. This is
particularly so where the third-party and birth parent are cooperating [Dennis, Case Note 20]
and a reasonable transition plan can be developed. On the other hand, a third party may be
given favorable consideration when he or she has acted as the primary caretaker for a
substantial period of the child’s life. [Kleinsasser, Case Note 37; Eppler, Case note 38].

DO CHILDREN HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS?
In the ongoing battles between birth parents and third parties, it seems that the rights of
children have been largely ignored, except to the extent that the best interests standard is still
considered on a secondary level. In Troxel, Justice Stevens in dissent found that children may
have a constitutional liberty interest in preserving family or family-like bonds. In a challenge
that does not appear to have been taken root in post-Troxel jurisprudence, Justice Stevens
warned:
“It seems clear to me that the due process clause of the 14th Amendment leaves
room for states to consider the impact on a child of possibly arbitrary parental
decisions that neither serve nor are motivated by the best interests of the child.” 120
S. Ct. at 2074.

Contrast Justice Stevens’ opinion with the recent case of Herbst v. Swan (Case No.
B152450, October 3, 2002, Court of Appeals for the State of California, Second Appellate
District), applying Troxel and reversing a decision awarding visitation to an adult sister with her
half-brother (after their common father died). The statute was determined to be an
unconstitutional infringement upon the mother’s right to determine with whom the child could
associate.

In Winczewski [Case Note 13], Judge Brewer, citing a number of cases from other
states and literature from journals, noted: “In the wake of Troxel, courts are beginning to
recognize that ‘a child has an independent, constitutional guaranteed right to maintain contact
with whom the child has developed a parent-like relationship.’” 188 Or App at 754. Judge
Brewer recognized that “***it is now firmly established that children are persons within the
meaning of the constitution and accordingly possess constitutional rights.” 188 Or App at 752.
But such rights are not absolute: “When the compelling rights of child and parent are pitted
against each other, a balancing of interest is appropriate.” 188 Or App at 750. In the final
analysis, however, Judge Brewer did not articulate the parameters of a child’s constitutional
right and how that is to be applied, concluding only that a child’s constitutional right “to the
preservation and enjoyment of child-parent relationship with a non-biological parent is both
Page - 15

Grandparent and Psychological Parent Rights in Oregon after Troxel (October 2014)

evolving and complex.” 188 Or App at 756. It would appear that Judge Brewer would be
content to consider a child’s constitutional right as part of the best interest analysis, but only if
the Troxel presumption has been rebutted. 188 Or App at 756. Commenting upon Judge
Brewer’s analysis, Judge Schuman and Judge Armstrong were sympathetic to “a more
sensitive evaluation of the child’s interest than Troxel appears to acknowledge,” but refused to
accord to a child a free-standing fundamental substantive due process right. Rather, Judge
Schuman and Judge Armstrong would accord a child “an interest protected by the state as
parens patriae” rather than as a right. 188 Or App at 761.
In the 2003 and 2005 legislative sessions, this author proposed legislation (SB 804
[2003], SB 966 [2005]) which would mandate the appointment of counsel for children in
contested custody third party v. parent proceedings, unless good cause was shown. Counsel
would be appointed at the expense of the litigants, but each court would be required to
develop a panel list of attorneys willing to represent children at either modest means rates or
pro bono. The legislation stalled in committee in 2003 and 2005 with opponents citing cost
considerations to litigants and that the court’s discretionary power was adequate.

Rights of Third Parties to Seek Visitation and Custody of Children, 47 F.L.Q. 1, 34 (Spring
2013).
TIPS AND WARNINGS
•

ORS 109.121-123 (former grandparent visitation statutes) were abolished. Now,
grandparents are treated as any other third parties seeking visitation or custody.
Therefore grandparent-child relationship which has languished for more than a year
may result in the loss of any right to make a claim. (However Grandparents are given
some special considering in juvenile court proceedings. ORS 419B.876)

•

Although ORS 109.119 does not require the specific pleading of facts to support the
rebuttal of the parental parent presumption, some trial courts have required this and
have dismissed petitions without such allegations.

•

ORS 109.119 requires findings of fact supporting the rebuttal of the parental parent
presumption. Be prepared to offer written fact findings to the court.

•

It may be appropriate to seek appointment of counsel for the children involved. ORS
107.425 applies to psychological parent cases. It mandates the appointment of counsel

Page - 16

Grandparent and Psychological Parent Rights in Oregon after Troxel (October 2014)

if requested by the child and permits the appointment of counsel at the request of one
of the parties. Expense for the appointment is charged to the parties.
•

Custody and visitation evaluations are authorized upon motion at the parties’ expense.
This evidence is critical to the issue of the presumption as well as best interests of the
child. An evaluator should be prepared to speak to issues of attachment (both to the
birth parent and the third party); potential short and long term emotional harm if the
child is placed with the birth parent or third party.

•

The application of third party rights in the juvenile court has been substantially
restructured. See ORS 419B.116; 419B.192; 419B.875; 419B.876 In 2003, the
legislature created a new form of guardianship that would permit third parties to have
custody of children under a court’s wardship, but without the involvement of the
Department of Human Services (DHS). (ORS 419B.366).

•

Request findings of fact pursuant to ORCP 62 at the outset of your case and be
prepared to draft the findings for the court. This will reduce the likelihood of remand if
an appeal is successful.

•

Whether representing a birth parent or a third-party, counsel should consider and
present to the court a detailed transition plan to guide the court’s decision in the event
that a change of custody is ordered.

“Your Ethics Wake-Up Call”

FAMILY LAW CONFERENCE October 10, 2015

John L. Barlow
Barnhisel Willis Barlow Stephens & Costa, PC

Requesting Advisory Opinions
When in doubt, a good place to start—request an advisory opinion from the General
Counsel’s office.

Individual lawyers may request opinions about their own conduct or proposed
conduct. Keep in mind that inquiries are not a means to resolve misconduct that
has already occurred. Do not include specific client information or information
sufficient to reveal the client’s identity because calls to General Counsel are not
subject to the attorney-client privilege or otherwise confidential.
Bar keeps notes of telephone inquiries from lawyers for five years.
Good faith effort to comply with opinion is a basis for mitigation of sanction, in
addition to any other defenses or evidence warranting mitigation, in disciplinary
proceedings Rule of Professional Conduct (hereinafter RPC) 8.6(b).
See H. Hierschbiel, “Ethics Advisory Opinions,” Oregon State Bar Bulletin,
August/September 2015; G. Reimer, “Written Ethics Advisory Opinions,” Oregon
State Bar Bulletin, June 2003.

Note: I have included a version of the following outline of the disciplinary process in the
written materials each time I have made a presentation at the Family Law Conference. It
follows the outline given to members of the Disciplinary Board during their orientation to
the process. Each year, I have added information and commentary about case law
developments and updates regarding procedures.
Although my presentation this year will not include a thorough discussion of the
disciplinary process, I include this outline as a useful reference or guide for any
practitioner who must respond to a Bar inquiry or complaint.
I also include relevant excerpts from the Oregon State Bar Statement of Professionalism in
any presentation to lawyers. Those excerpts are listed at the conclusion of these materials,
Your Ethics Wake-Up Call, page 1

and provides the ultimate “safe harbor” in any situation regarding appropriate and ethical
conduct.

“The purpose of lawyer discipline is to protect the public and the administration
of justice from lawyers who have not discharged, will not discharge, or are
unlikely to discharge properly their professional duties.” American Bar
Association, Standards Section 1.1
“[Bar discipline] is not intended to be punitive but to deter wrongful conduct.”
In re Stauffer, 327 Or 44, 66 (1998)
“Not every negligent or unprofessional act, no matter how misguided, boorish or
rude, gives rise to an ethical violation.” In re Paulson, 341 Or 13, 27 (2006)
A. Outline of the Disciplinary Process

1.

First Level--Client Assistance Office--Initial Contact with Attorney

“Don’t Panic”

1500 matters reviewed each year-- ~80--85% go no further, 15--20% are referred to Disciplinary
Counsel.
Do I need a lawyer?
Consider whether complaint is really about ethics. Fee disputes,
litigation tactics, minor communication problems may be resolved at the
Client Assistance Office level without Disciplinary Counsel involvement.

“[A] lawyer shall not...knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for
information from an admissions or disciplinary authority...” RPC
8.1(a)(2)--- (Exception for confidential matters under RPC 1.6)
Initial inquiry letter from Disciplinary Counsel will include highlighted reference to this
rule.
Bar Rule 7.1

Suspension for Failure to Respond--Effective November 1, 2013
“(a) When an attorney fails without good cause to timely respond to a
request from Disciplinary Counsel or the LPRC for information or
records...Disciplinary Counsel may petition the Disciplinary Board for an
order immediately suspending the attorney until such time as the attorney
responds to the request or complies with the subpoena.”
Note: Two years after its adoption, Disciplinary Counsel now
routinely invoke this rule to motivate attorney responses to requests
for information. If the threat of suspension results in a response, the
attorney may be charged with a violation of RPC 8.1(a)(2)
anyway—whether or not the attorney is charged with a violation
based on the original complaint.
“(f) Suspension of an attorney under this rule is not discipline.
Suspension or reinstatement under this rule shall not bar the SPRB from
causing disciplinary charges to be filed against an attorney for violation of
RPC 8.1(a)(2) arising from the failure to respond or comply as alleged in
the petition for suspension filed under this rule.”
“Remarkably, failing to respond to an ethics complaint is the most easily
avoidable disciplinary violation, but continues to be one of the most
common, year-in and year-out.” “Enforcing the Rules,” J. Sapiro,
Oregon State Bar Bulletin, April 2013

B. Specific Rule Violations
“Ignorantia juris non excusat.”
1.

Competence
RPC 1.1
A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client.
Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill,
thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the
representation.
Note: Whenever “reasonable” or “reasonably” is used in relation to
conduct by a lawyer, the term “denotes the conduct of a reasonably
prudent and competent lawyer.” RPC 1.0(k)

In re McCarthy, 354 Or 697 (2014)
Lawyer was retained through a referral service to represent multiple plaintiffs whose
properties were then subject to non-judicial foreclosure proceedings. He filed a lawsuit on
behalf of the plaintiffs based on statutes he had not previously encountered. At the time he filed
the complaint, he had no prior experience with Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) or “Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”) matters. He did not read the entire TILA or RESPA
statutes or rules before filing the complaints. He relied primarily on sample pleadings he
obtained from the referring organization. He also believed that the referring organization would
provide backup legal counsel to him as needed as the lawsuit progressed. He did not associate a
TILA specialist on the case and severed his relationship with the referring entity before he filed
the complaint.
The lawyer did not know and did not inform his clients that by the lawsuits created the

Your Ethics Wake-Up Call, page 5

risk that the lender could pursue a deficiency judgment against them. He also did not inform
them that by including in the complaint a claim for relief based upon a federal statute (the TILA
allegations) he created the possibility that the cases could be removed to federal court by any
defendant. He also failed to get some of the defendants served timely under the applicable
limitations periods. Some of the defense attorneys wrote to the attorney, pointing out
deficiencies in his complaint and agreeing, prospectively, to waive service if he would amend
and correct the complaint. The attorney’s response was to miss deadlines and to cease effective
communication with his clients.
These gaps in knowledge and performance opened up opportunities for the lawsuit
defendants, who immediately sought removal to federal court and ultimately pursued deficiency
judgments against the plaintiffs. The penultimate result was that the plaintiffs had to accept
more onerous settlement terms.
The ultimate result was that the lawyer received a 90-day suspension.

In re Jagger, 357 Or 295 (2015)
Attorney represented a criminal defendant on matters including several contempt
citations
for violating a FAPA restraining order. The criminal charges were based in part on the conduct
that violated the restraining order.
While the defendant remained in jail, the lawyer called and invited the protected party to
come to his office to discuss the matter and made an appointment for that meeting. It is likely
that language and cultural barriers caused the protected party to misunderstand the lawyer’s role
in the proceedings.
In any event, the protected party came to the lawyer’s office not on the day of the

Your Ethics Wake-Up Call, page 6

appointment but on the very same day he first called her. When she arrived, the lawyer
happened to be speaking on the telephone with the defendant, who was still in jail. The lawyer
invited her to speak to the defendant about the restraining order on the telephone, while the
lawyer left the room.
The defendant was convicted of contempt of court for violating the no-contact provision
of the FAPA restraining order, based on this telephone conversation.
Not only did the trial panel and Oregon Supreme Court find the lawyer guilty of violating
RPC 1.2(c), (“a lawyer shall not … assist a client in conduct that the lawyer knows is illegal”)
but further found him guilty of violating the competence rule, RPC 1.1. They concluded that
the
lawyer’s advice to his client to talk to the protected person while the FAPA order was still in
effect “could not have been the product of legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation
reasonably necessary for the representation.”
Jagger illustrates the strict application of RPC 1.1, even in the face of evidence that the
lawyer had actual knowledge of the FAPA order and its terms, because his violation of the rule
depended not on his ignorance of the law but his apparent failure to think through the
consequences of his well-meaning advice. In other words, knowledge of the law is no more a
defense than ignorance if the lawyer’s advice or performance is contrary to that law.
Competency in the 21st Century—Metadata.

Metadata generally means “data about data.” As used here, metadata means the embedded data
in
electronic files that may include information such as who authored a document, when it was
created, what software was used, any comments embedded within the content, and even
a record of changes made to the document.
Lawyer’s Duty in Transmitting Metadata
Your Ethics Wake-Up Call, page 7

Oregon RPC 1.1 requires a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client, which
includes possessing the “legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably
necessary for the representation.” Oregon RPC 1.6(a) requires a lawyer to “not reveal
information relating to the representation of a client” except where the client has expressly or
impliedly authorized the disclosure.
Information relating to the representation of a client may include metadata in a document. Taken
together, the two rules indicate that a lawyer is responsible for acting competently to safeguard
information relating to the representation of a client contained in communications with others.
Competency in relation to metadata requires a lawyer utilizing electronic media for
communication to maintain at least a basic understanding of the technology and the risks of
revealing metadata or to obtain and utilize adequate technology support.
From Formal Opinion 2011-187, revised 2015.
2.

Neglect.
RPC 1.3 Diligence
A lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to the lawyer.

Perennially, this is the one of the most frequently cited rules in Disciplinary Reporter
volumes—14 of 33 trial panel cases reported in the 2014 volume implicated Rule 1.3
Lawyers who have run afoul of this rule have typically not taken advantage of resources
available
through the Bar, Lawyer Assistance programs, and the Professional Liability Fund. Frequently
the deficiencies in performance have arisen because the lawyer is experiencing personal or
family
problems, health crises, or office management difficulties. Keep in mind that a separate rule,
RPC 1.16(a)(2), requires an attorney to withdraw from representation when the attorney’s
physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer’s ability to represent the client.
Reliance on health problems to justify conduct that might otherwise violate the RPCs, or to
mitigate a sanction in the event a violation is found, could lead to a charge under this rule.
Recent examples of violations of this rule relevant to family law practice include failure

Your Ethics Wake-Up Call, page 8

to file Uniform Support Declarations in temporary support proceedings, failure to appear at
hearings when duly noticed, errors in child support calculations resulting in substantial overor underpayments, and failures to communicate with clients before preparing critical hearing
documents. Of course, violations of RPC 1.3 frequently implicate other rules, notably RPC
1.4(a) (failure to keep a client reasonably informed or respond to requests for information), RPC
1.4(b) (failure to adequately explain a matter to a client), and RPC 1.16(d) (failure, upon
termination of representation, to take reasonable steps to protect client’s interests).
C.

Hypotheticals.

Lawyer A represents Client A in litigation. Lawyer B represents Client B in litigation.
Lawyer A is fired by Client A shortly before trial and is granted leave to withdraw as counsel of
record. Lawyer B seeks leave to withdraw for nonpayment of fees, and leave is granted. Both
Client A and Client B hire other counsel to protect their interests, and their respective
cases continue.
Both Lawyer A and Lawyer B are owed substantial fees by their
clients and both have in their possession documents and information of
critical importance to their clients’ cases, which the clients cannot practicably duplicate or
replace.
Questions:
1. May Lawyer A retain client documents or information until all
past-due fees are paid?
2. May Lawyer B retain client documents or information until all
past-due fees are paid?
(Source—Formal Opinion No. 2005-90).
Lawyer represents Client in a matter set for trial. One week before trial is scheduled to begin,
Client files a Bar complaint, but does not discharge Lawyer. The complaint alleges Lawyer
failed to interview key witnesses, and failed to return Client’s phone calls to discuss trial
strategy. Lawyer does not believe the witnesses identified by Client will be able to provide
admissible testimony, but is willing to interview them in the time remaining before trial. Lawyer
further believes that he or she has made reasonable efforts to respond to Client’s inquiries and to
keep
Client informed.

“Birth Through Three” Defined
• “Birth Through Three” refers in the cited
literature and this presentation to children
under the age of four.
• Chronological age is not the only determinant of
children’s status and abilities.
• Developmental age is also a factor for
consideration.

How do parents/professionals balance

the importance of attachment with
parental involvement?

Historical Tension Points
Attachment Theory

Parental Involvement Research

• Attachment forms
hierarchically from a primary
attachment to one person
and to others later in life

• Multiple attachments form
concurrently – there is no such
thing as primary attachment

• Primary attachment is an
overarching protective factor

• Involvement of both parents is
an overarching protective factor

• Interfering with primary
attachment is more harmful
than disrupting the
relationship with the other
parent

• Interfering with parental
involvement is more harmful
than disrupting attachment
to the primary parent

• Research conducted primarily
on mothers is sufficient to
understand attachment
mechanisms and function

• Research focused primarily on
fathers, which frequently
excluded fathers with problems,
is sufficient to generalize to
overnights & other special
circumstances

Finding Balance
“Reliance on either attachment theory or joint
parental involvement research, as if these two
strands of development are not overlapping and
inextricably related, has in our view, fostered
polarizations in legal and academic thinking and
practice, impeding thoughtful integration of the
existing reliable knowledge bases.”

Defining Attachment
Attachment is the deep and abiding
emotional relationship between
an infant and her caregiver.
It is more than a bond, as it is
characterized by the sensitive
attunement of the caregiver to the
infant’s nonverbal cues, and the
emotional satisfaction and safety
experienced by the infant.

Distinguishing Attachment

8/18/2015

Bonding & Attachment are not equivalent
Qualities of Bonding

Qualities of Attachment

• Strength of adult’s feeling of
connection to the child

• Quality of child’s emotional
connection to caregiver

• Care giving is focused on
completing the tasks of
providing care to the child

• Care giving is focused on
meeting the expressed needs
of the child (attunement)

• Caregiver sets pace for
interaction

• Child initiates interaction and
adult responds (reciprocity)

• Child withholds distress
response until contact with an
attachment figure
• Relationship is goal oriented
(future focused)

• Child freely expresses distress,
openly & without reservation
• Relationship is interpersonally
oriented (present focused)

Aspects of Attachment

1. Attachment is created
Consistent, warm,
responsive care that is
attuned to the physical
and emotional signals
of the child creates
secure attachment.

15
8/18/2015

Aspects of Attachment

2. Secure attachment creates a system for:
▫ Development of critical neural
connections
▫ Managing internal states, i.e. emotional
regulation
▫ Developing self-awareness
▫ Building meaningful relationships with
others
▫ Feeling secure enough to explore
▫ Caring about the feelings of others

Emotional Regulation 101

8/18/2015

• Emotional Regulation is the ability to identify, manage
and recover from strong feelings.
• Repeat experiences of emotional regulation allow a
child to understand and accept his own feelings, use healthy
ways to handle them, and keep going even under stress.
• Chronic, unresolved emotional dysregulation exposes
the infant/young child’s brain to damaging stress hormones
during critical developmental periods.

Emotional regulation in infancy is a critical
component of healthy brain development

Aspects of Attachment

3.Attachment is a process, not a state
▫ Develops and changes over the
lifespan
▫ Can be strengthened and
reinforced through responsive
care

Aspects of Attachment

4. Attachment security = attachment resiliency
▫ Secure attachment creates a base for
developing other attachments
▫ Secure attachment allows for repair after
disruption/breach of relationship
▫ Secure attachment increases
adaptive capacities of child to
deal with stress

8/18/2015

Supporting Attachment to Both Parents
Encouraging Attachment

The key to building and
maintaining attachment is
to focus on the child’s
experience and needs, as
opposed to the parents’
desire for fairness.

• Provide responsive care
▫ Feeding
▫ Comforting
▫ Sleeping or napping
• Reduce Parental Anxiety
▫ Primary Residential Parent
▫ Other Parent
• Create opportunities to build
attachment without chronically
distressing the child

22
8/18/2015

Protective Factors Associated with
Involved Fathers
On average, one-third of children
whose parents have separated lose
contact with a parent, usually a dad.
• Higher educational achievement across
lifespan
• Better performance in mental skills
• Higher level of social/emotional functioning
• Fewer behavioral problems
• Greater financial security

23
8/18/2015

Caveats: Understanding the
Co-Parenting Literature
• Studies of father involvement typically excluded
fathers with histories of child abuse, mental
illness, chemical dependency, and domestic
violence
• Only about 20% of separating families take the
case to court; about 5% have trials (Johnston,
1994). Broadly applying co-parenting literature
to higher conflict dyads is not always
appropriate.

24
8/18/2015

Families are Changing
• More than 40% of parents are not married.
• 16% of all same sex couples in the US are raising children
together.
• The rate of adoption by same sex couples has doubled since
2000.
• Multigenerational families in one household are increasing
for the first time in decades.
• Nearly 10% more grandparents are raising children now
than in 2000.
Same sex co-parenting relationships and an everincreasing number of never married parents add
dimension which cannot be encompassed within a
traditional binary model.

Co-Parenting & Domestic Violence…
Mutually Exclusive Paradigms
Coercive Worldview
• I am entitled to more respect
than others.
• My needs are more important
than others.

Collaborative Worldview
• Others are entitled to equal
respect.
• Other people’s needs are equally
important.

• I try to get what I need/want
through violence, threats, or
intimidation.

• I negotiate and problem-solve to
try to get what I need.

• There is one right way to
solve a problem, my way.
• Children are an extension of
the parent – their needs
mirror mine & are otherwise
less important.

• There are many ways to solve a
problem.
• Children are unique individuals
– their needs are separate from
mine & of equal importance.

26
8/18/2015

Domestic Violence & Custody Disputes
Studies conducted by the National Center
for State Courts (NCSC), looking solely at
court records, have found documented
evidence of domestic violence in 20-55%
of contested custody cases.
(NCSC Publication Number R- 202)

27
8/18/2015

Principles of DV Screening
• Get appropriate training.
• Screen everyone & screen often.
• Always consult with experts.
• Understand lethality indicators (Jacquie Campbell Danger Assessment):
▫ Presence of a weapon,
▫ Recent attempts to leave,
▫ Extreme jealousy/control,
▫ Threats to kill/harm,
▫ Chronic, long-term unemployment, and
▫ Victim beliefs about danger.
• Include all forms of violence, e.g. emotional, verbal, economic,
sexual, physical.

The Issues
• Determining Safety
• Supporting existing attachment
• Building attachment
• Exploring the right frequency of contact
• Considering overnights

30
8/18/2015

Pruett, McIntosh & Kelly, 2014
• The consensus of the authors
regarding research on attachment:
“Children form concurrent
attachments to caregivers but still
prefer proximity to one or the
other at different ages.”
• Thus the goal of parenting plans for
young children is:
“to foster both developmental security
and the health of each parent-child
relationship, now and into the
future.”

Overnight Considerations - Highlights
• An existing relationship of at least 6 months is a critical
first level assumption for overnights.
• Children and parents must be safe (Gateway Factors).
• The presence of conflict in itself is not prohibitive –
frequency and intensity of conflict are factors.
• “Step up” plans and activities to increase parental
capacity make sense and should be supported where
appropriate.
• Signs of distress can be normal, but significant and/or
prolonged distress should be addressed (See Birth Through
Three, p.21).

45
8/18/2015

Overnight Considerations – Caveats
• “Even when all parenting conditions are met,
higher frequency overnights* are not generally
indicated for infants 0-18 months”
McIntosh, Pruett & Kelly 2014

• When uncertain about the outcome for a child,
do the least harm – conservative approach
• Generally, deference to parental discretion and
joint decisions is recommended

* More than one per week

Helping Parents: Grounding Principles
Barring safety concerns, children do best when:
▫ Parents communicate, cooperate, and are flexible
when needed
▫ Both parents are involved in many aspects of the
child’s life
▫ Children perceive that each parent supports the
relationship with the other parent
▫ Parents’ actions are consistent with their words

Helping Parents:
Shifting from Present to
Future Focus

8/18/2015

1.

Do you know parents who are divorced or separated and coparenting successfully now? What does that look like?

2.

If your child could talk now, what would she say about how
she wants you to co-parent and get along?

3.

How would you like your co-parent relationship to look in five
years?

4.

How can I help you move from the dynamics of your romantic
relationship into the healthy dynamics of your co-parent
relationship?

RESEARCH-BASED TOOLS FOR PARENTING TIME PRACTITIONERS & DECISION-MAKERS
Suggestions and Ideas for Birth through Three Parenting Time Plans
In families where established concerns exist about parent safety, child safety, or the parent has no established
caretaking relationship with the child:
General Suggestion:
Weekly, short period of time with possible provisions for supervision of parenting time, neutral/safe exchanges of
the child, and/or review of provisions by Court if warranted.

For Example: Parent A shall be responsible for the care of the child at all times other than on Sundays from 10:00
a.m. until 12:00 p.m. each week. (Optional) For a period of _____weeks Parent B’s parenting time will be
supervised by________. The exchanges for these parenting times shall occur in a public location. Parent A shall
share all information regarding the child via e-mail only. This court shall hold a 30 minute status check hearing at
the end of the ________ week period to determine when or if the parenting schedule shall be expanded.
For families where mental health or substance abuse concerns exist:
For families where there are attachment concerns, or the child is exhibiting persistent behavioral
maladjustment:
General Suggestion:
Prioritize protection of the child’s psycho-social and emotional development during the first three years of life.
Ensure that at least one organized attachment relationship is supported between the child and Parent A even if that
results in less parenting time with Parent B. Consider not only the number of overnights, but the spacing and
frequency of transitions between homes, and the emotional difficulty to which the child will be exposed.

Anticipate changes in the parenting plan. Changes can be accommodated through a series of step-ups articulated in
detail, to be implemented at a pace and level determined by the child’s responses to each step, and each parent’s
ongoing ability to effectively enact the proposed plan individually and as a parenting team.
For Example: Parent A shall be responsible for the child's care at all times other than every Sunday from 10:00 a.m.
until 4:00 p.m. and every Thursday from 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
For parents working on improving attachment and parenting skills with Parent B:
General Suggestion:
Frequent consistent contact of several hours in length that allows for routine care to occur helps the child bond.
For Example: Parent A shall be responsible for the child's care at all times other than every Tuesday and Thursday
from 4:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. and every Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. when Parent B shall be responsible
for the child’s care.
Where concerns about coparenting exist or logistics dictate restricted parenting time:
General Suggestion:
Two periods of three to four hours and one 8 hour period spaced throughout each week.
For Example: Parent A shall be responsible for the child's care at all times other than every Monday and
Wednesday from 3:00p.m until 6:00p.m and every Saturday from 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. when Parent B shall be
responsible for the child’s care.
For high functioning, cooperative, actively involved parents:
General Suggestion:
Frequent consistent contact of several hours in length and an overnight allows routine care to occur helps to
maintain bonded relationships.
For Example: Parent A shall be responsible for the child’s care at all times other than every other Monday and
Wednesday from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00pm and every Friday overnight from 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. on Saturday.

Generally, deference to parental discretion and joint decisions is encouraged.

PARENTAL SEPARATION AND OVERNIGHT CARE OF YOUNG
CHILDREN, PART I: CONSENSUS THROUGH THEORETICAL AND
EMPIRICAL INTEGRATION
Marsha Kline Pruett, Jennifer E. McIntosh, and Joan B. Kelly

The AFCC Think Tank on Research, Policy, Practice, and Shared Parenting was convened in response to an identified need for
a progression of thinking in the family law field, removed from the current polarizing debates surrounding the postseparation
care of infants and very young children. We share this goal as our research and commentaries have been centrally implicated
in the current controversies. Our collaboration over this empirical paper and its clinical counterpart endorses the need for
higher-order thinking, away from dichotomous arguments, to more inclusive solutions grounded in an integrated psychodevelopmental perspective. We first critically appraise the theoretical and empirical origins of current controversies relevant to
attachment and parental involvement research. We then describe how attachment and parental involvement contribute complementary perspectives that, taken together, provide a sound basis from which to understand the needs of very young children in
separated families. As a companion piece, Part II offers a collective view of a way forward for decision making about overnights
for infants and young children, toward the integration of theoretical and empirical with clinical wisdom.
Key Points for the Family Court Community:
• An integrative perspective suggests that the goals of attachment and early parental (typically paternal) involvement with
very young children after separation are mutually attainable and mutually reinforcing rather than exclusive choices.
• An optimal goal for the family is a “triadic secure base” developed through a co-parenting environment that supports
the child’s secure attachment with each parent and the recognition by each parent of the other’s importance to the child.
• Cautions against overnight care during the first three years are not supported. The limited available research substantiates
some caution about higher frequency overnight schedules with young children, particularly when the child’s relationship
with a second parent has not been established and/or parents are in frequent conflict to which the child is exposed.
Keywords: Attachment; Children; Divorce; Infants; Overnights; Parent Involvement; Parenting Plans; and Separation.

Various narrative strands combine within the family law arena to form this decade’s debates about
overnight care for young children of separated parents. These deliberations occur against a backdrop
of increasing legislative support for shared-time parenting following separation. Presumptions are
being proposed in various states, provinces, and countries for both legal (decision making) and
physical (parenting time) care of children, yet the merits of such presumptions remain unclear,
especially for families with very young children. While developmental vulnerability unique to this
stage of life is duly acknowledged by most who offer a view on the topic, the associated solutions
offered when parents separate or live apart vary, sometimes quite markedly. Common to all arguments
is an attempt to protect the infant and young child by ensuring that essential components of early
development are not jeopardized by the postseparation parenting arrangement.
Proposals for the arrangements that could best provide this protection vary along differing theoretical and research lines. Two foci often posed in family law as “either-or” propositions are attachment theory, with its focus on continuity of caregiving for the young child and an historic emphasis
on the role of mothers in this, and joint parental involvement, with its focus on the ongoing mutual
parenting roles of both parents following separation, with particular emphasis on father involvement.
Reliance on either attachment theory or joint parental involvement research, as if these two strands of
development are not overlapping and inextricably related, has in our view, fostered polarizations in
legal and academic thinking and practice, impeding thoughtful integration of the existing reliable
knowledge bases.

The need to achieve a coherent view is pressing, with the certain knowledge that every family law
decision carries significant and potentially enduring consequences for young children and their
parents. In this paper we begin by examining the sources of dichotomous perspectives at the heart of
the current debate. While acknowledging that differences in professional opinion will remain, we
concur that perspectives on parenting plans and judicial orders in separated families that focus
simultaneously on the developing child and his/her significant relationships are not only theoretically
possible but empirically supported. After examining the scant existing research in terms of what it
does and does not tell us about overnight care, we identify points of consensus we share. We conclude
with a summary that lays the foundation for our companion paper (Part II, this issue). Part II provides
a set of assumptions about the individual and family conditions under which overnights are most likely
to support the developmental needs of the very young child, and a chart of considerations for weighing
these in the individual case.

EARLY CHILDHOOD DEFINITIONS
Terminology in itself can cause problems, such as, when parties think they are describing the same
events or experiences but in fact are not. The definitions pertaining to early childhood are no exception.
Although researchers in the early child mental health field (National Research Council and Institute of
Medicine, 2000; Zeanah & Zeanah, 2009) recognize the formative years as spanning pre-birth through
to the fifth year, a “0–3 years” definition is commonly used to connote the years of greatest vulnerability
(see www.Zerotothree.org) in family law and mental health literature. Included in this definition is
infancy, commonly referred to as the pre-verbal stage, which ends around the first year with the
emergence of talking and locomotion. In line with the available research specific to separated parents
and overnight care, we refer to early childhood as the period from birth to and including the year of being
three (0–48 months). Given the significant and normative diversity of psycho-emotional and cognitive
accomplishment among three year olds, ambiguity surrounds this age cutoff for overnights. At issue is
whether the age of three is substantively different enough from 1–2 years old, regarding psychosocial
and emotional development, to be included in the definition of “young child” and all it represents when
making decisions about overnights, or whether it constitutes a significantly less vulnerable age. In this
paper we adopt the view that the year between 3 and 4 belongs in this 0 to 3 period, while recognizing
normative and significant variation in the age at which children manifest a range of vulnerabilities and
consolidate new skills. We include the year of being three in our “young child” distinction as it affords
the protective function some children of this age need.
Within the vast spectrum of developmental achievement from infancy through preschool, three
broad eras within these years are generally evident and differentiated in our formulation: the first
eighteen months of life, the second eighteen months of life (18–36 months), and the year of being
three. As each era presents different challenges and possibilities for parents living apart, we occasionally make these distinctions within this paper, and when combining the eras, use the collective
term “early childhood”.
Synonymous with healthy social and emotional development, “infant mental health” refers to the
young child’s capacity to experience, begin to regulate and express emotions, form close and trusting
relationships, explore the environment and learn (Greenough, Emde, Gunnar, Massinga,& Shonkoff,
2001; Zeanah, 2009). Given the sheer dependence of infants and young children on their caregivers,
mental health in early childhood is best understood in a relational frame. There is general agreement
about factors important in explaining both health and dysfunction in early psychosocial and emotional
development. Chief among these stressors that affect development are poverty, neglect and abuse,
heritable predispositions—including cognitive capacity and temperament, and the interactions of each
of these with the early caregiving environment. Multiple factors determine the overall caregiving
environment, chiefly parent mental health and associated parenting capacity (Clarke-Stewart, Vandell,
McCartney, et al., 2000; Cummings, Keller, & Davies, 2005; Kaufman, Plotsky, Nemeroff & Charney,
2000; Keitner & Miller, 1990; Meadows, McLanahan, & Brooks-Gunn, 2007), parental reflective

242

FAMILY COURT REVIEW

functioning (Slade, 2005), caregiving sensitivity and response (Brown, Mangelsdorf, & Neff, 2012;
George & Solomon, 2008), and the quality of the co-parental relationship in collaborative caregiving
(Cowan & Cowan, 2010; Pruett & Pruett, 2009). The implicating factors for childhood outcomes most
substantively in the purview of family law are parenting and co-parenting capacities. During the
powerful transitions in the family initiated by separation it is the nurturing and teaching that parents
and supportive co-parenting provide that safeguard healthy trajectories of psychosocial, emotional,
and cognitive well-being throughout the first years of life.
Whether examining child development from the perspective of attachment (Zeanah, Boris, &
Lieberman, 2000), neurobiology (Schore, 2012; Siegel, 1999), or broader psycho-emotional, social
and family systems perspectives (Harris, 1995; Karney & Bradbury, 1995; Minuchin, 1988), there is
wide consensus that the infant’s success in meeting the emotional and behavioral goals of early
childhood is profoundly influenced by the relationship foundations laid in infancy and sustained
thereafter.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS FOR UNDERSTANDING EARLY CHILDHOOD
OVERNIGHTS DEBATE: ORIGINS OF THE CONTROVERSY
Of the many early childhood and family theoretical perspectives brought to bear on the dilemma of
overnights, two main bodies of knowledge have been emphasized in family law deliberations over the
past 25 years: attachment and parental involvement. Controversies about overnights for young children stem, in part, from adherence to either one or the other of these theoretical positions. The
attachment and parental involvement arguments over the past decade are well documented (Kelly and
Lamb, 2000; Lamb & Kelly, 2001, 2009; Solomon and Biringen, 2001; Pruett, 2005; McIntosh, 2011;
Warshak, 2005), and we will not repeat them here. We do describe the core tenants of each position
to identify the principles from which we are working.
ATTACHMENT THEORY AND ITS INTERFACE WITH THE OVERNIGHTS DEBATE

Attachment refers to a specific facet of the infant/parent relationship. Attachment is a biologically
based behavioral system in all infants of all cultures that has the set goal of ensuring protection from
disorganizing anxiety through proximity to attuned and responsive caregivers, who soothe in the face
of distress and support exploration in the world. Attachment relationships are understood to support
the infant’s growing ability to express and regulate emotions (see Siegel & McIntosh, 2011 for
overview), as well as to explore and learn with confidence (Gunnar, 2000; Sroufe, Egeland, Carlson
& Collins, 2005). Studies in multiple contexts have demonstrated the developmental reach of attachment trauma (Sagi-Schwartz & Aviezer, 2005; Zeanah, Danis, Hirshberg et al., 1999), as well as the
power of healthy attachments to buffer trauma (Sroufe et al., 2005).
Early attachment researchers in the Bowlby/Ainsworth tradition studied a culturally and socioeconomically diverse range of families (Carlson, Sroufe, & Egeland, 2004). However, these studies
lacked gender diversity, with investigations predominantly focused on the development of infantmother attachments, their antecedents and longer-term consequences. From this research emerged the
concept of attachment primacy, referring to an infant’s preference in the first two or so years of life
for seeking comfort from one figure over others, this figure usually being the mother, and the stress
that separation from this figure posed. Application of this research to family law provided a basis for
decision-making, in which lengthy and frequent separations from primary caregivers were accepted as
a risk factor for infant security. For several decades in many Western countries, overnights with fathers
during infancy were widely discouraged. Bowlby and Ainsworth wrote about the importance of both
parents, and over the past 30 years, empirical attention has slowly but increasingly been given to
attachment interaction between father and infant, and the complementary roles of mother and father
in fostering developmental security. Unfortunately, to date little attention has been paid to attachment
dynamics with same sex parents.

Pruett, McIntosh, and Kelly/PARENTAL SEPARATION AND OVERNIGHT CARE OF YOUNG CHILDREN, PART I

243

Research on infant-father and other significant attachments confirm Ainsworth’s early observation
(1977) that infants are equipped to form concurrent attachments to emotionally available caregivers by
approximately 7–8 months (Easterbrooks & Goldberg, 1987; Lamb, 1977 a, b). There is agreement
across multiple studies that infants prefer proximity to one parent or the other at different ages and for
different needs and experiences, particularly in their first 18 months (Fox, Kimmerly, & Schafer, 1991
van IJzendoorn & De Wolff, 1997). Attachment status to mother and father are generally independent,
with each relationship influenced by the contingent response of each parent. While security with one
parent does not reliably predict security with the other, attachments to co-habiting parents are
mutually influenced (Main et al., 2011; Kochanska & Kim, 2013; Sroufe, 1985; van IJzendoorn & De
Wolff, 1997).
Meta-analytic studies of infant attachments to both parents in non-clinical samples found a similar
proportion of infants (67%) classified with secure attachments to father or to mother (van IJzendoorn
& De Wolff, 1997). In a demographically varied sample of 101 families, Kochanska and Kim (2013)
reported that 45% of infants had secure attachments concurrently to both their mothers and fathers,
while 17% were insecurely attached to both. Insecure attachments to both parents pose a greater risk:
“double-insecure” children at 15 months had greater behavioral difficulties at six years (teacher
report) and eight years (self report) than those secure with at least one parent.
As first articulated by Bowlby, normative differences between mother and father caregiving
behaviors have long been noted across cultures. Mothers’ sensitive response to infants’ stress states
and fathers’ sensitive and stimulating play and teaching behaviors are particularly salient (Ainsworth,
1967; Brown et al., 2012; Grossmann et al., 2002; van IJzendoorn & DeWolff, 1997). Each pattern of
interaction can foster secure attachment. Theory posits and research provides evidence that a mother’s
sensitive response to stress enables the child to experience that the world is predictable, safe, and that
the child can learn to manage his/her distress through the relationship. Similarly, a father’s sensitive
challenging facilitates the child’s learning to monitor and control his/her excitement, promoting the
goal of self-regulation.
Normative differences between trends in mothering and fathering are often exaggerated, with
exciting play and teaching attributed as the exclusive domain of fathers and sensitive response as the
main province of mothers. In contemporary family life and particularly when fathers are involved in
direct child care, mothers and fathers respond far more similarly than differently in the ways they
soothe, play and teach, and mother and father attachments reinforce each other’s influence on the
child’s development (Grossmann, Grossmann, Kindler, & Zimmermann, 2008; Parke & Asher, 1983).
The triadic nature of attachments is only beginning to be understood. The literature on same sex
parents’ attachment interactions with their young child is yet to be established, but there are no
theoretical grounds to suggest that empirical evidence for the independence of an infant’s attachment
to each parent will not also be demonstrated in these relationships. The idea that babies have gender
biases in attachment formation is not well supported. The more accurate assertion is that babies
respond best to sensitive and predictable caregiving that facilitates internalized patterns of care; that
is, babies learn to respond across situations as if they can expect such quality of care (Bazhenova,
Stroganova, Doussard-Roosevelt et al., 2007; Carlson, Cicchetti, Barnett & Braunwald, 1989;
Grossman, Johnson, Farroni, Csibra, 2007; Minagawa-Kawai, Matsuoka, Dan et al., 2009; Trevarthen,
2001).
THE JOINT PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT LITERATURE AND ITS INTERFACE WITH THE
OVERNIGHTS DEBATES

There is little argument that, given the opportunity, forming two secure attachment relationships
in early infancy is multiply beneficial, as is preserving them beyond infancy. Policy debates during
the era of the “tender years” presumptions focused on preventing disruption in the primary attachment relationship, with solutions often giving preference to safeguarding the mother–child over
father-child attachment. A new wave of commentary and research has emerged in the past two
decades, focusing on joint parental involvement, and bringing equal weight to examining the critical

244

FAMILY COURT REVIEW

developmental role of fathers in early childhood (Cowan & Cowan, 1992; McHale, 2007; K. Pruett,
2000).
The concept of parental involvement is a broader one than attachment, encompassing behavioral
and learning systems that support relational as well as cognitive, educative, socio-economic, moral,
cultural, and spiritual developmental goals. Parental involvement literature focuses on the developmental advantages accrued to children when both parents are physically and emotionally accessible,
participate in direct care taking tasks and decision making, and provide financial support (Collins,
Maccoby, Steinberg, Hetherington, & Bornstein, 2000; Luster & Okagaki, 2006; Pleck, 2010).
A research focus on fathers has emerged, particularly in the separation and divorce literature, as a
natural outgrowth of the knowledge imbalance about the role each parent plays in child development.
Whereas a wealth of theory and research had already confirmed the salient influence of early
mother-infant relationships on long-term outcomes, less was known with respect to father-infant
relationships. A second major impetus for father-focused research came from several decades of
custodial determinations and parenting plans that minimized the non-resident father’s role and the
time allotted to him to spend with his children (typically every other weekend or 14% of time). In
response to the realization that a growing number of children were growing up with minimal, if any,
involvement of their fathers, a concern developed across academia, policy and government about what
effect “fatherless America” (Blankenhorn, 1996) was having on children’s developmental trajectories
in the U.S., with similar concerns expressed in other Western nations and more recently, in countries
worldwide.
Studies on father involvement repeatedly showed that school aged children whose fathers were
minimally present or absent from their lives had difficulties across behavioral, cognitive and academic
achievement, social, moral, and emotional domains (Furstenberg, Morgan, & Allison, 1987;
McLanahan, 1999; Wallerstein & Kelly, 1980). In contrast, significant benefits for children across
domains are associated with higher levels of positive paternal involvement (for reviews, see Kelly,
2012, King, 2002, Cowan, Cowan, Cohen, Pruett & Pruett, 2008; Sandler et al., 2012). Like mothers,
fathers’ warmth, structure, and discipline benefit children. Studies find that fathers also make unique
contributions to sibling, peer, behavioral and achievement outcomes, with many of the benefits
manifested through middle childhood and into adolescence and adulthood (Flouri & Buchanan, 2004;
Steele, Steele & Fonagy, 1996; Veríssimo et al., 2011; Verschueren & Marcoen, 1999). Still, the ideal
bases for development of positive father-child relationships and benefits, like mother–child, are
initiated in the earliest years of life (Boyce et al., 2006; Brown et al., 2012; Feinberg & Kan, 2008).
The attachment literature added support to the father involvement literature on this very point.
Researchers from both theoretical leanings established through their studies what children have
always demonstrated clinically: the early years matter and young children desire and benefit from
warm and positive involvement with both of the people who gave birth to and/or are invested in their
well-being.
An important contribution of the father involvement research was the identification of demographic, personal, interpersonal, and institutional barriers that impede many separated fathers’ ability
to remain meaningfully involved with their children (Cowan, Cowan, Pruett, & Pruett, 2007; Kelly,
2007). Demographic variables associated with diminished father involvement include being unmarried at childbirth, unemployment, lower income, less education, and the younger age of the child
(Amato & Dorius, 2010; Amato, Meyers, & Emery, 2009; Insabella, Williams, & Pruett, 2003).
Fathers’ personal barriers include prior marginal involvement with their children, inability to be
consistent and in compliance with parenting plan schedules, mental illness, substance abuse, violence,
anger and depression (Hetherington & Kelly, 2002; Johnston, 2006; Johnston et al., 2008; Kelly,
2007). Interpersonal barriers include highly conflicted co-parental relationships (Maccoby &
Mnookin, 1992), and maternal gatekeeping when it unjustifiably discourages or limits contacts
(Austin, Fieldstone, & Pruett, 2013; Pruett et al., 2012; Trinder, 2008). Cultural and institutional
policies and practices often reflect a disproportionate lack of support for an active paternal parenting
role after separation (Alio, Bond, Padilla, Heidelbaugh, Lu & Parker, 2011; Coakley, 2013; Cowan
et al., 2008; Parkinson, 2010).

245

PARENTING TIME DISTRIBUTION AFTER SEPARATION: AT THE HEART OF THE DEBATE

The question of overnights for young children of separated parents is embedded in several
questions concerning “what amount of time” with each parent optimizes adjustment to separation and
ongoing general development. How much time is needed to ensure that separated parents each
continue to invest in the early relationship with their young child and are able to consolidate a
foundation for lifetime involvement? How much time with one parent is needed for a baby to become
or to remain behaviorally secure in that attachment? How much time away from a parent, at what point
in early childhood, and in what circumstances, is stressful and disruptive to that attachment and to
related developmental goals? How should the amount of time spent with each parent be considered in
the context of attachment with one or both parents who have seriously compromised mental health?
These questions must be asked for each infant–parent relationship. Yet they are often laced with an
implicit assumption that one parent’s gain is the other parent’s loss, and that the baby either wins or
loses, as well. An integrated perspective suggests that the goals of both attachment and parental
involvement are mutually attainable, though achieving both goals becomes more complicated when
parents separate. As with parents in dispute, the best interests of the child are likely to be met by the
best care that each parent provides. We focus the remainder of the paper on a fundamental
reconceptualization of the current debate, wherein attachment and parental involvement become
nested concepts, and the place where they meet becomes the locus for crafting parenting arrangements
for very young children.
REFRAMING THE QUESTIONS AND ISSUES TOWARD AN INTEGRATED SOLUTION
We start from a developmental perspective, and ask: “What is the developmental goal of a parent
spending time with a baby?” For many attachment researchers, the answer is equipping the baby with
“at least one caregiving relationship” that is constant and responsive enough for the baby to develop
an organized strategy for finding protection, relief from anxiety, and delight in shared interaction
(Main, Hesse, & Hesse, 2011). Organized strategies refer to secure and insecure ambivalent or
insecure avoidant patterns. All three patterns represent adaptations made by the baby to the caregiver.
Disorganized attachment refers to the young child who shows little consistency in behavior toward
attachment figures at times when most would seek reassurance. Instead, the child appears fearful of the
parent and unsure about what to expect in terms of the care that will be provided. Separation and
divorce, like other major transitions, are associated with an increase in children’s insecure behaviors.
Separating parents may be preoccupied and stressed, responding to the child with less attentiveness,
more anger, and less patience; moreover, the structure of the family unit has abruptly changed
(Hamilton, 2000; Hetherington, Cox & Cox, 1985; Waters, Merrick, Treboux et al., 2000). It is
expected that behaviors associated with a more aroused attachment system will be evident, though a
constant arousal puts the baby at risk for disorganized attachment becoming stable. High levels of
parent conflict and violence during marriage and after separation are similarly related to increased
evidence of insecure behaviors and may challenge the consolidation of healthy attachment relationships that were forming (Cummings & Davies, 2010; Solomon & George, 1999).
Both attachment and parent involvement perspectives express concern about the impact of lengthy
or extended separations on infant-parent attachments and stress levels. One problem has been the lack
of concrete definitions for these terms. In separation/divorce research, father-child time has been most
commonly measured by the frequency of contacts in a defined period of time. This imprecise measure
fails to indicate the amount of actual time children and nonresident parents spend together or the
pattern of that time. Recently, researchers have used the quantity of time spent between children and
nonresident parents in a given period because it better indicates opportunities for parenting (Fabricius,
Sokol, Diaz, & Braver, 2012), but this does not address the issue of time intervals between contacts
(i.e., the length of the separation from either parent) or the frequency of transitions made by the child.
From the attachment perspective, “frequent” separation refers to repeated absences occurring
regularly, and concern focuses on the impact of frequent change on the baby’s security with main

246

FAMILY COURT REVIEW

caregivers. From the paternal attachment perspective, “frequent” contact was intended to avoid
lengthy separations of the infant from the father which had previously characterized parenting plans
for very young children. Here, the outcome of concern was nurturing or sustaining the infant-father
attachment without stressing the infant. “Lengthy” separations address the number of continuous
hours within a unit of contact, but there is no agreement as to whether “lengthy” means eight hours,
24 hours or three days. “Extended” separation refers to the continuing absence of a caregiver over
many days or weeks, but this too is not well defined, and there is no consensus about what is “too
long”, or how this might differ by age and temperament.
Attachment theory is clear that a core determinant of stress in separation from an attachment figure
is the presence or absence of another effective attachment figure. Profound distress arises when such
a relationship is not available, leaving the infant’s attachment state “switched on”. When another
effective attachment figure is available, the baby’s anxieties can be assuaged and stress reduced. This
attachment perspective on the years 0–3 provides this guidance: at least one organized attachment is
essential for the young child, especially in the face of stress and adversity (Sroufe et al., 2005). When
two positive relationships with parents have been established prior to separation, the facilitation of two
organized attachments after separation will normally enhance developmental outcomes, and thus
represent the young child’s interests (van IJzendoorn et al., 1997). In this scenario, parenting time
needs to allow for regular responsive interaction with infants.
Taking a longer view, we ask: how do we create a healthy start for life-long relationships that begin
from a fragile basis, without jeopardizing early attachment organization? There is irony in the attempt
to compartmentalize these developmental issues into “either-or” options. Whatever their theoretical
persuasion, developmental experts regard the nucleus of early development as occurring in the context
of caregiving relationships that exist within concentric family and community rings of influence
(Bronfenbrenner, 1986; Sagi & Van Ijzendoorn, 1996; Tavecchio & van IJzendoorn, 1987). Just as
each parent crafts his/her child’s attachment security (Sroufe, 1985; van IJzendoorn & DeWolff,
1997), similarly, each parent contributes to the development of wider behavioral systems and psychosocial attainment. Just as neither parenting function covers the gamut of childhood developmental
needs, “either-or” thinking about children’s needs after separation is incomplete.

CURRENT RESEARCH FINDINGS: UNDERSTANDING THE DATA
BEFORE MOVING TO A CONSENSUS PERSPECTIVE
In integrating disparate perspectives, we suggest that a consensus perspective of the available
research on young children and parenting plans is also possible. Toward this end, we summarize the
small pool of studies reporting data on the demography of pre-school overnight care arrangements,
parent–child time data, and the developmental correlates of various parenting arrangements.

DEMOGRAPHY OF OVERNIGHT CARE ARRANGEMENTS

While representative studies show that rates of overnight parenting time across the world have
climbed in school age and adolescent populations (Bjarnason et al., 2010; Carlsund, Eriksson,
Lofstedt, & Sellstrom, 2012), relatively few families undertake high levels of overnights in early
childhood. Current general population statistics in the United States and Australia indicate that in
separated families, between 93–97% of children aged 0–3 years spend less than 35% of their nights
with the non-resident parent (Kaspiew et al., 2009; McIntosh, Smyth, Kelaher, 2010; Tornello, Emery,
Rowen, Potter, Ocker, & Xu, 2013). These data appear to reflect normative sociological differences in
parenting roles during infancy. While active parenting by fathers is increasing in intact families, across
many western countries (Casper & Bianchi, 2001; Pleck & Masciadrelli, 2004) the majority of
hands-on caregiving during infancy is still undertaken by mothers (Baxter, Gray & Hayes, 2010).
Furthermore, a significant amount of leisure time is spent by parents together with their young child.

Divorce and separation not only changes individual parenting time, but also clearly subtracts normative “together time” from the young child’s caregiving equation.
Parents who share higher frequency overnight schedules tend to be socioeconomically advantaged
relative to lower frequency or no contact groups (Smyth, Qu & Weston, 2004; McIntosh, Smyth &
Kelaher, 2013). Differentiating factors include significantly higher incomes, educational attainment,
marital status, prior co-habitation in a committed pre-separation relationship, and maintenance
of a cooperative relationship postseparation. The clustering of these characteristics in family court
populations, especially among parents who have never been married, is less frequent, suggesting
that parental choices about overnights, and hence disputes, may play out differently across family
structures.

DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES IN EARLY CHILDHOOD ASSOCIATED WITH
PARENTING TIME

Studies examining correlates of postseparation parenting plans for very young children are scant.
Any new field of science begins with single studies that form an incomplete picture. Commonalities
can be identified across studies as the research pool grows. Research in this area is still a long way off
from forming a critical mass. Four of the five existing studies are recently and thoroughly reviewed
elsewhere (Kuenhle & Drozd, 2012), and our attention to them here is in the service of integration. A
brief review of the five studies is provided below (see McIntosh & Smyth, 2012; Pruett, Cowan,
Cowan, & Diamond, 2012, for more extensive details on sampling, methodology, analytic strategy,
and limitations). A summary of relevant sample similarities and differences is presented in Table 1.
Solomon and George (1999) conducted the first study in this area with a voluntary sample of 126
separated mothers and explored the course of attachment organization to the mother from ages one to
three years. Most of the parents had not shared a live-in relationship prior to or after the child’s birth.
At follow-up, using a modified Strange Situation (Ainsworth, 1978) as the methodology of study, they
found evidence of significantly more anxious, unsettled, and angry behavior in toddlers who as infants
had weekly or more overnights with non-resident fathers (compared to a mixed group of nonovernighters and children in intact families—a confound in the study). High parental conflict, anxiety,
and parents’ inability or unwillingness to communicate with each other about their baby influenced
the children’s outcomes. Notably, 41% of children moved to an overnight plan in the intervening year
before the follow-up. Some had not seen their fathers regularly in the intervening year, and a few had
no prior contact.
Pruett et al. (2004) studied a working and middle class sample of 132 parents with children 0–6
years who averaged 4.9 years old a year and a half after the parents entered the study and when the
overnights data were collected. The family court-involved parents agreed to be part of a randomized
study that included a cooperative co-parenting intervention and a control condition; data were
collected from both parents. Most (75%) of the children had one or more overnights per week.
Parenting plans were reported in terms of overnights (yes/no), number of caregivers and consistent
schedules week-to-week. Reports of children’s cognitive, social and emotional difficulties according
to each parent were studied. Similar to the Solomon & George and McIntosh et al. studies, parental
conflict and parent–child relationships were more highly related to children’s difficulties than were the
parenting plan variables. Consistency of schedule and number of caregivers were more important than
overnights in and of themselves. Girls were beneficiaries of overnights and multiple caregivers, but
boys were not. Two characteristics of the data to note are: 1) These children were not infants, the
majority were preschoolers. 2) Parents reported moderate or lower levels of conflict and high conflict
parents were excluded or opted out of participation.
McIntosh et al. (2010, 2013) used a sample of parents living apart, drawn from a large randomized
general population database1. Emotional regulation was examined for children in three age groups—
infants under two years, 2–3 years, and 4–5 years. Different thresholds of overnight care were defined
for infants under two years, and for 4–5 year olds, ranging from no overnights but regular day contact,

to some overnights, and most frequent overnights (one per week or more for babies under two years,
and 35–50% for 3–5 year olds). Emotional regulation outcomes were studied after accounting for
parenting style, co-parenting relationship qualities, and socio-economic status, variables known to
influence developmental outcomes.
Parents with higher levels of angry disagreement and parenting and lower education had children
with poorer health, emotional functioning, and lower persistence. No differences were found in global
health or other scores related to physical or other aspects of development in any of the three age groups.
While some variables studied showed no group effects, infants in the “most frequent” overnight
group (1+ nights per week) were reported to be more irritable than the “less than weekly” overnight
group, and kept watch of their parent significantly more often than the “daytime only” group. Children
aged 2–3 years in the “most overnights” group (35% or more overnights between their parents)
showed significantly lower persistence in play and learning than those in either of the lower contact
groups, and more problematic behaviors. Overnights did not predict significant group differences in
the 4–5 year old group on any outcomes. Limitations of this study include small sample sizes for the
infant group and relatively small effects. Given that the analyses were conducted at one point in time,
neither cause and effect between overnights and outcomes nor the clinical significance of such
findings over time can be concluded.
Altenhofen, Sutherland & Biringen (2010) conducted a small study of child attachment in a sample
of 24 divorcing mothers and children, ages 12 to 73 months, the majority of whom were 2–4 years old.
Parents were white, educated, and infants averaged eight overnights per month with fathers. Waters’
Attachment Q-Set (AQS) (Vaughn & Waters, 1990; Waters & Deane, 1985) and the Infancy/Early
Childhood version of the Emotional Availability (EA) Scales (Biringen, Robinson, & Emde, 2000)
provided the main assessment tools. In this sample, 54% of children showed an insecure attachment
with the mother. Mothers’ emotional availability was related to a less conflictual co-parenting
relationship, and the children involving their mothers in play contributed to attachment outcomes.
Neither age at which overnights started nor other relevant variables in the study explained differences
in children’s attachment security. Similar to Pruett et al., this study showed the most salient contributors to child difficulty or adjustment to be the quality of parenting and the co-parenting relationship.
Limitations of the study include the small sample and lack of a control group or data from fathers.
Tornello, Emery, Rowen, Potter, Ocker & Xu (2013) utilized data from the Fragile Families and
Child Well-being Study. These data are representative of the population of 20 major inner US cities,
consisting of predominantly black, unmarried, low income mothers who typically had not lived
together with the father at birth or follow-up. The study analyzed attachment and childhood adjustment data provided by mothers from a separated families sample of 1,023 one-year-olds and 1,547
three-year-olds who had contact with both parents. Consistent with Solomon and George (1999) and
McIntosh et al. (2010), one year olds with more frequent overnights (1 or more per week) were more
likely to show attachment insecurity or emotional dysregulation when those infants were three-yearsold. Consistent with (Kline) Pruett et al., three-year-olds with more frequent overnights (at 35%+) did
not show adjustment problems at either ages three or five years. One of 28 analyses showed that three
year olds with more frequent overnights had more positive behavior at age five than those who had rare
overnights or day only contact. As with the other studies, overnights were not related to a number of
child outcomes when the child was age three. The socio-economically disadvantaged sample of
inner-city parents, most of whom had never lived together, is applicable to families with similar
characteristics seen in the family court, but is not generalizable to the whole spectrum of families seen
in separating families with or without parenting disputes.
On many levels, the studies are difficult to summarize, and defy grouping. Each used different
samples and different data sources, asked different questions about how outcomes are related to
overnight time schedules for infants, and explored different schedules and amounts of overnight time.
None of the studies can be said to provide a comprehensive coverage of the relevant developmental
issues. The usual research caveats are applicable: data collected at one time point precludes interpretations that suggest cause and effect (this pertains to all of the studies except Tornello), and statistically significant findings may be small enough in absolute terms not to be clinically relevant (see

250

FAMILY COURT REVIEW

Pruett & DiFonzo, 2014, for an expanded explanation of the latter caveat). Moreover, the studies
illustrate the importance of taking into account differences between and within samples of families
with widely varying demographic characteristics. Multiple questions remain, such as which infants
fare better with more frequent overnight arrangements, and what aspects of development—such as
cognitive, language, and psychosocial outcomes—may be enhanced by including overnight care in
parenting schedules from an early age as well as later ages. None have covered the range of families
seen in family court and those who negotiated parenting plans with lawyers, mediators, or among
themselves. This field of knowledge will advance and increasingly differentiate family and parenting
circumstances based on the collective evidence of multiple studies that are yet to be conducted.
From the overlap across existing studies and an integration of the broader developmental and
family literatures, we offer seven points of consensus that form the basis of subsequent clinical
recommendations and policy considerations (see Part II of this issue). Bear in mind that the research
utilizes group data, and we encourage a view that validates both group trends in these data and the
importance of appreciating variation in each family’s individual situation.

POINTS OF CONSENSUS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF
YOUNG CHILDREN IN FAMILIES LIVING APART
#1: Early childhood (0–3 years inclusive) is a period critical to subsequent psychosocial and
emotional development and is deserving of special attention and planning in family law
matters.
#2: Across all family structures, healthy development in the young child rests on the capacity of
caregivers to protect the child from physical harm and undue stress by being a consistent,
responsive presence.
#3: Similarly, healthy development rests on the capacity of caregivers to stimulate and support
the child’s independent exploration and learning and to handle the excitement and aggression
that accompanies the process of discovery.
#4: Secure development in this phase requires multiple supports to create both continuity and an
expanding caregiving environment for the young child that includes family, community,
educational and cultural connections.
#5: A “both/and” perspective on early attachment formation and joint parental involvement is
warranted. The young child needs early, organized caregiving from at least one, and most
advantageously, more than one available caregiver. An optimal goal is a “triadic secure base”
constituted by both parents and the child as a family system, where a healthy co-parenting
environment supports the child’s attachment relationships with each parent and vice versa.
#6: The small group of relevant studies to date substantiates caution about high frequency
overnight time schedules in the 0–3 year period, particularly when the child’s security with
a parent is unformed, or parents cannot agree on how to share care of the child. Equally true,
clinical and theoretical cautions against any overnight care during the first three years have
not been supported.
#7: Critical variables in considering readiness for and the likely impact of overnight schedules
include parents’ psychological and social resources, the current nature of parental
dynamics—particularly conflict, and the nature and quality of each parent–child relationship
prior to separation.

CONCLUSIONS
As articulated throughout this article, and addressed elsewhere (Pruett & DiFonzo, 2014), little is
yet known about the developmental impacts of overnight care. The field is practically devoid of
longitudinal datasets or studies that follow children’s adjustment through preschool and into school.

Pruett, McIntosh, and Kelly/PARENTAL SEPARATION AND OVERNIGHT CARE OF YOUNG CHILDREN, PART I

251

The roles of other family members (siblings, grandparents, etc.) and the potential influences of child
care as additional forces that influence children’s responses to separation and overnights remain
unexplored terrain. The place of ethnic and cultural identities and practices raise questions that are
virtually untouched. The relevance of parent gender will in time be explicated by research conducted
with separating same-sex couples, and by studies of heterosexual fathers who were stay-at-home dads
prior to the separation. Studies differentiating age, education level, and family values will enable us
to better compare international trends. We eagerly anticipate the time in which answers to questions
about infant overnight care evolve from methodologically sophisticated studies with diverse samples.
Until that time, we stand together as three authors whose viewpoints have been linked to differing
attitudes and findings about overnights for young children, and have been used in court rooms and
conference rooms as “proof of ” evidence for which we declare there to be no proof. We present here,
instead, an attempt at integrating foundational knowledge. Our synthesis of attachment and parental
involvement perspectives points to the centrality of parent–child relationships for sound decision
making. Even though we strongly encourage co-parenting, we also understand that some relationships
and family contexts restrict how much and how well parents living separately can raise their child
together at a given time. For children 0–3 years, parents’ capacity to function as a supportive unit in
the service of protecting the child’s rapidly developing and highly vulnerable world may determine
whether overnights support, are neutral, or are harmful to the child. In Part II of our parental
separation and overnight care of young children series, we take the next step of building upon the
consensus principles we have reached here by charting the facilitative and protective conditions under
which the youngest children are likely to thrive in overnight care.

PARENTAL SEPARATION AND OVERNIGHT CARE OF YOUNG
CHILDREN, PART II: PUTTING THEORY INTO PRACTICE
Jennifer E. McIntosh, Marsha Kline Pruett, and Joan B. Kelly*

This article is a companion piece to the empirical and theoretical perspectives on infant overnight care arrangements offered
in Part I. Grounded in an integrated psycho-developmental perspective, the paper provides a set of clinical assumptions and a
related chart of practical considerations, to guide decision making about infant overnight care, both in the individual case and
in broader policy contexts. At all levels of decision making, we endorse the need for developmentally sensitive resolutions that
protect both the vulnerabilities of early childhood and support lifelong parent–child relationships, whenever possible.
Key Points for the Family Court Community:
• Parenting orders or plans for children 0–3 years of age should foster both developmental security and the health of each
parent–child relationship, now and into the future.
• From a position of theoretical and empirical consensus, we provide an integrated set of assumptions and considerations
to guide decision making about overnight parenting plans.
• These considerations apply equally to planning in the individual case and to policy level decisions.
Keywords: Attachment; Children; Divorce; Infants; Overnights; Parent Involvement; Parenting Plans; and Separation.

TOWARD DEVELOPMENTALLY RESPONSIVE PARENTING PLANS AND ORDERS
The consensus points outlined in Part I of this paper (Pruett, McIntosh, & Kelly, this issue) provide
the foundation for the current article (Part II). We take the view that parenting orders or plans for the
0–3 year group have twin and mutually reinforcing responsibilities; the first to foster developmental
well-being during the first three years, and the second to support the health of each parent–child
relationship, now and into the future. Here, we bridge relevant bodies of developmental and divorce
research into a set of assumptions and clinical considerations, in the hope of providing practical
guidance for individualized planning about the postseparation care of young children.
Throughout these two companion papers, we resist the urge to prescribe fixed formulas about
numbers of overnights or age of commencement, and encourage policy makers and practitioners to do
likewise. Instead, we provide guidance about the key assumptions, principles and specific factors that,
when weighed together in the individual case, will foster developmentally sound decisions.

THE UNDERPINNING ASSUMPTIONS
A set of core assumptions provides a critical context for the decision-making chart that follows.
These assumptions prioritize both attachment organization and joint parental involvement whenever
the conditions of safety and the minimization of stress are met. Under such conditions, a responsive
parenting plan would allow the child to benefit from the ways that parent-child relationships in early
childhood differ normatively, and enable access to the full complement of emotional, cognitive,
family, social and economic resources each parent can offer. The clinical reasoning within the chart
(see Table 1) rests on three levels of assumptions:

Table 1
Considerations for determining postseparation overnight care of children aged 0–3 years
Bear in mind when using this chart, that. . .
1) The left column reflects conditions within the caregiving environment to be considered in determining the presence or absence, and frequency, of overnights.
2) Parents and other decision makers will need to weigh not only the number of overnights, but the spacing and frequency of transitions between homes, and the
emotional ease of the exchanges for the child.
3) Even when all parenting conditions are met, higher frequency overnights (see right hand column) are not generally indicated for infants 0–18 months. For reasons
of temperament or maturation, this will also apply to older infants/toddlers who demonstrate regulation difficulties or other signs that they are stressed by the
arrangements.
4) When either lower or higher levels of overnights are not indicated initially, they may become so with the child’s maturation, and/or with the assistance of
educational and/or counseling support for parents, or mediation. An agreed “step-up” plan is helpful in progressing toward overnights.
5) This developmentally based guidance for children 0–3 (i.e. up to 48 months) is not intended to override the discretion of parents who jointly elect to follow other
schedules in the best interests of their child, and in the context of their own circumstances.

1. Safety
A) The child is safe in the care of each parent
B) Parents are safe with each other
2. The child’s trust and security with each parent
The young child:
A) is continuing an established, trusting relationship (of 6
months or more) with a parent
When resident parent is not present, the young child:
B) seeks comfort from and is soothed by the other parent
C) finds support for exploration with the other parent
3. Parent mental health
The parent has:
A) sensitivity in recognizing and meeting child’s needs

C) no or well-managed mental health issues
4. Health and development
The young child:
A) has significant developmental or medical needs
B) such needs are well supported in the proposed arrangement
C) the infant is exclusively breast-feeding or will not yet accept a
bottle
5. Behavioral adjustment
Relative to temperament and stage of development, the child shows
any of the following persistent behaviors (i.e., over 3–4 weeks):
A) irritability, frequently unsettled, without medical cause
B) excessive clinging on separation
C) frequent crying or other intense upset
D) aggressive behavior, including self-harming behavior
E) regression in established behaviors, e.g. toileting, eating,
sleeping
F) low persistence in play and learning
G) any regressions or difficulties in the above are short lived and
readily resolved
6. Co-parental relationship
Parents are able to:

care by the other parent is prioritized
8. Family Factors
A) Arrangement reflects status quo and/or older siblings sharing
the same overnight schedule are a source of security to the
young child
B) Overnight arrangements would enable maintenance of other
relationships that are sources of security to the child, (e.g.,
grandparents) and/or enable exposure to important elements
of each parents’ cultural or religious practices.

FAMILY COURT REVIEW

First level assumptions:
Parenting plans and orders made for children 0–3 years are developmentally supportive when they
provide for a caregiving environment in which:
1.1) the young child is safe with, and can be comforted by, both parents; and
1.2) the young child is protected from harmful levels of stress.
Second level assumptions:
When level one assumptions are met, parenting plans:
2.1) Support the development of organized attachments to each parent/caregiver wherever parenting opportunities and capacities permit.
2.2) Encourage parenting interactions that support the development and maintenance of attachments with each parent. These interactions:
a) provide regular opportunities for direct care from each parent, involving soothing and
settling, teaching and playing, maintenance of important routines throughout the day
and night, and support to explore the wider world outside of the home and the immediate family; and
b) provide the young child with support to transition between parents, including comfort
and reassurance as needed.
2.3) Anticipate changes in the parenting plan through a series of well articulated step-ups, to be
implemented at a pace and level determined by the young child’s responses to each step, and
each parent’s ongoing ability to effectively enact the proposed plan individually, and preferably, in concert.
2.4) Reflect practical considerations. The arrangements are adequately supported by individual
and relationship resources, including realities of parents’ proximity to each other, work-life
schedules and flexibility, or lack of the same, and support networks.
2.5) Maximize the amount of time the young child is cared for by a parent, or when a parent is
otherwise unavailable, a family member or other person trusted by both parents. Parents
consider the child’s other parent as a first port of call when child care is needed.
2.6) Encourage shared decisions about major child-related issues, with effective use of mediation, co-parenting counseling, and related programs as needed.
Third level assumptions:
When level one assumptions are not met:
3.1) The priority is to ensure that one organized attachment relationship is formed (with practical
and therapeutic support as needed), even if that results in delaying time with the other parent.
3.2) Such circumstances may reflect characteristics or chronic behaviors of one or both parents
(e.g., neglect, current violence, severe personality disorders, mental illness) or factors within
the parental relationship (violence, high conflict, geographic distance) that render two
organized attachment relationships difficult to foster or sustain.
3.3) Some infants and toddlers will have two parents with a history of psychiatric problems,
substance abuse, poor parenting, and troubled relationships. Unaided, the infant may not be
able to form an organized attachment with either parent within a timeframe that is developmentally useful to the child. Ongoing therapeutic support and parenting education in these
cases are of critical importance.
CENTERPOINT: NATURE AND QUALITY OF THE PARENT–CHILD RELATIONSHIP
We suggest that both attachment and parental involvement perspectives point to a common
centerpoint upon which decisions about overnights are best grounded: the nature and quality of the

McIntosh, Pruett, and Kelly/PARENTAL SEPARATION AND OVERNIGHT CARE OF YOUNG CHILDREN, PART II

259

parent-child relationship. It is here that most young children have their early psycho-emotional needs
met, and where the young brain receives the developmental nourishment that sets a future course for
healthy maturation. Attachment security, child mental health, resilient coping, and cohesive family
environments hinge squarely on each parent’s history of providing consistent, sensitive responses to
the child’s needs.
In all families, an essential condition for implementation of overnight care in the years 0–3 includes
a pre-existing relationship with the nonresident parent, generally for at least six months, in which the
infant has been safe and felt comforted. Hence, early overnights are more likely to occur with parents
who have lived together through pregnancy and in the early months of the child’s life, or by
non-cohabiting parents who are cooperative and mutually invested in the child’s relationship with both
parents. In all contexts, it is important that parents monitor their child for signs of overload, and
respond accordingly.
Within our suggested framework, individual infant needs and parents’ circumstances may dictate
the need for more or less daytime contacts, or overnights, and different starting points. The guidance
provided should not prevent parents from adapting their arrangements to ensure more effective,
responsive parenting. From the child’s perspective, caregiving schedules are designed to minimize
separation-induced distress and support routines in the child’s day-to-day life. The schedule should
not create lengthier separations from either parent than the child can manage. Symptoms in the child
as described in the table above (see Point 5) may signal the need for changes in the schedule or in
aspects of parenting, co-parenting, or the transition itself, to better accommodate the child. Patience
will be needed while finding the right balance for the individual child.
Some parents have not established or consolidated a relationship with the child, or with each other,
yet co-parenting has clear merit, and a plan to support its growth is needed. In this scenario, the
duration of parenting time with an unknown or lesser known parent would initially be limited to a few
hours on each occasion, and of sufficient frequency, until the parent-child relationship is on sure
footing. This will encourage familiarity and growth within the infant of memories of trust and comfort
(Main, Hesse, & Hesse, 2011). A focus on safety and security for the child means that in cases of
chronic parental or interparental disturbance, manifested in abusive or neglectful parenting, apportioning parenting time to ensure the development of at least one organized attachment, with one
person determining how day-to-day care will proceed for the child’s sake, becomes a necessary
priority.

MEANINGS FOR LEGISLATION AND POLICY
Understanding the confusion and anxiety that indeterminate legal standards can engender, family
lawyers and advocates for mothers, fathers, and children have sought presumptive rules that can be
applied to most or all families. We believe, however, that unqualified presumptive “for” or “against”
rules regarding parenting plans will not adequately protect the best interests of very young children.
We suggest that a hierarchy of priorities, such as that offered here, can guide both the decisions that
parents and family court professionals make, as well as the expectations of parents in settlement and
parenting time planning. Given the general developmental, divorce and separation-specific research
about overnights described in Part I of our shared writing, we recommend a thoughtful approach. In
general, when there are concerns about any key aspect of the child’s development and/or the
caregiving environment, parenting plans that are initially conservative about overnight frequency, and
that have built in step-ups, are appropriate. Optimally, growth in the plan would be forecast in advance,
and step-ups would occur within a specified timeframe, guided by the young child’s adjustment to
each change, and without the need to return to family court.
We support co-parenting as a general rule and principle. We also support the goals of developing
parenting capacity and supporting the deepening of skills and knowledge within each parent and
between parents, whenever possible. Availability of specialized parent-infant mental health interven-

260

FAMILY COURT REVIEW

tions, parent education programs designed for infancy through age 3, and programs for high conflict
situations that help parents understand the destructive nature of their behaviors and implement
positive change are important in this regard.
There are families within the court population for whom this co-parenting principle will not apply,
and for whom these interventions will not be successful. For multiple reasons, some parents involved
in postseparation disputes demonstrate significant impediments to collaborating over child rearing,
including in decision-making. Increasingly, parents are entering the family court younger, with fewer
social and socioeconomic resources (Kaspiew et al., 2009). Most important, many of these parents
lack the foundation provided by having once had some relationship with each other of an affectionate
and trusting nature before having a baby together. Others have had only sporadic contact with the
infant since birth. Chronic mental health problems, drug or alcohol addictions, histories of engaging
in high risk behaviors, ongoing threat and coercion, and personality disorders are some of the
confounding dynamics that further inhibit development of a collaborative co-parenting alliance
(Johnston, 2006; Kaspiew et al., 2009). One or both parents may lack the skills or intent to collaborate
with the other, reject the importance of the other, and have no desire to co-parent toward the purpose
of jointly protecting and enriching their child’s development.
Conflict is not always perpetrated or maintained by both parents (Kelly, 2003). Conundrums exist
when the parent caring for the child a majority of time is also the one to unreasonably reject or block
the meaningful participation of the other parent. Severe borderline pathology and/or rage associated
with the separation often underlie the unreasonable behavior and accompanying conflict. Especially in
these situations, individualized planning becomes essential. From the perspectives of attachment and
parental involvement, when a nonresident parent has been an involved parent prior to separation in
ways beneficial to the parent and child, it may be important to implement a parenting plan involving
that parent regularly in all aspects of the child’s care, despite the lack of a parenting alliance. These
are likely to be situations requiring careful mental health and parenting evaluation and intervention,
and skilled parenting coordination (Kelly, 2014; Sullivan, 2013), monitoring and weighing multiple
parent and family based conditions that will impact the child’s current and future mental health.
Parents who did not have a trusting relationship with each other and/or the child before separating
will need some assistance that helps each to appreciate the value of the other in the child’s life, to
become aware of their responsibilities and parental obligations, to parent effectively, to find ways to
communicate with each other, and to co-parent despite potentially little knowledge of each other.
Parenting courses or specialized infant-parent therapies can help parents transcend fragile beginnings,
while mediation and parenting coordination can assist in determining if, and to what extent, parents
are able to participate meaningfully in the child’s care, including overnights.

CONCLUSIONS
Building on the theoretical, developmental, and empirical consensus established in Pruett,
McIntosh, & Kelly, Part I (this issue), this paper takes the task of integration a step further, by detailing
a practice framework for crafting developmentally supportive arrangements for children 0–3 years.
This framework prioritizes both the early establishment of organized attachment and the early
nurturance and maintenance of enduring relationships between each parent and their child. When
infants enjoy trusting relationships with both parents, and when their parents can work together to
implement plans that support these goals jointly, there is more opportunity to advance both goals
concurrently. When conflict and other qualities of parent(s) or their interaction render it impossible to
advance both goals simultaneously, it becomes necessary for the developmental goals to be staggered.
In normal development, new competencies and skills rarely come “online” simultaneously, or with
equal efficacy. Staggered or uneven development naturally occurs in the 0–3 years, especially as the
young child tackles a new or higher order developmental challenge. While working to gain competence in one area, such as speech, a pause or temporary lapse is often evident in a more physically
determined skill, as the child pours their energy into the new challenge. We believe this scenario is a

McIntosh, Pruett, and Kelly/PARENTAL SEPARATION AND OVERNIGHT CARE OF YOUNG CHILDREN, PART II

261

metaphor for what happens with overnights, and provides a useful lens for parents and other decision
makers to apply. Despite parents’ best efforts, when a young child shows that they cannot concurrently
master both attachment security and the developmental demands placed on her by overnights,
delaying overnights may simply allow development to catch up with the challenge of the new
situation. Often, this requires little more than a slower pace of progression in the parenting plan to
afford the child time to grow or advance her ability to self-regulate and adjust. If supported to do so,
the child will soon signal that she is able to manage, if not eager to assume the next step.
As one parent described in a letter to the therapist involved, recognizing and supporting the need
for staggered progress can be key to ensuring the child’s confident movement into higher levels of
overnights1:
. . . Our son is nearly three. We separated shortly after he was born, and had court orders for increasing
overnights, which would have led to 50/50 by the time he was two. He started to stay overnights with me
when he turned one but was clearly distressed with the separations. I couldn’t have him be distressed. I
chose (despite friends believing otherwise) to work with his desires and wants. So we discontinued the
overnights for awhile. He was always happy with me in the day including being put to bed for his day time
sleep, and we kept that going, and brought the nights back slowly. Over time, through his own volition he
became comfortable with staying overnight. Now, he will just state (for the record!) that he will be staying
“all night” with me and that’s it. Sometimes, after this declaration he might back track a little but by then
I just reassure his doubts and we move on and he is happy, and sleeps soundly. He often now wants to stay
on longer with me and transition times are joyfully undertaken. We are on a roll. So, needless to say I’m
happy with the decision to allow him to come to this in his own time.

A basis of trust between parents for working through overnight care issues supports a triadic base
of security for early development, and beyond. The case of parents who have never lived together
during the child’s lifetime or never shared an intimate bond is clearly different. Here, support to forge
a safe connection between parents is necessary for the very young child to forge a safe connection with
each parent. Given the diversity in parenting circumstances endemic to the family-law field, we
suggest that case-by-case planning for children 0–3 years is essential. This need not be a lengthy,
arduous or specialist task. Using the assumptions and considerations mapped in this paper as a guide,
a shared analysis by parents and family law practitioners of the pertinent qualities within the family
triad is possible.
In time, we hope to better differentiate circumstances that allow young children to benefit from
various overnight parenting plans, and to distinguish those that do not. Research will help advance the
discussion from supposition to a nuanced understanding that accounts for the incredible diversity
evident in developmental trajectories and family constellations. Our work here represents only a
beginning in this task. As clinical experience in using this framework increases, we expect that
patterns will emerge that are instructive to designing interventions and policies that support parents
with the challenge of creating a developmentally supportive life for a young child, after separation.
Ultimately, informed policies and practices that both embrace the unique complexity of the first
three years of life, and build strong relationship foundations for the coming years, will best protect the
life-long developmental interests of the young child. We hope our shared interest in safeguarding
children and families has provided a useful framework for parents and for professionals to thoughtfully resolve their own uncertainties about these issues, case by case.

INTRODUCTION
The 2015 legislative session mirrored prior sessions in that it resulted in significant statutory

changes impacting the family law practice area. The Oregon Child Support Program has more
flexibility to suspend enforcement of child support upon a change in physical custody. The process
for entry of support order in cases with multiple orders was streamlined. The legislature created a
step-by-step statutory framework for the process of re-adoption that was previously missing from
statute. Adopted children were provided greater access to information about their biological parents
and siblings. Oregon DHS was tasked with adopting rules for adoption proceedings that are designed
to better reflect the dynamics of foster parents, potential adoptive families, and relatives. Victims of
domestic violence were afforded greater access to stalking protective orders, they were provided an
additional protection through the creation of an emergency protective order that is accessible 24/7
by a peace officer, and they can now rest assured that their confidential communications with their
advocates will be protected from disclosure in court. A new state law was created to provide local
law enforcement officers the ability to enforce firearm restrictions in cases involving restraining and
stalking orders. The legislature took up the task of updating outdated statutes that failed to reflect
the constitutionally protected right of same-sex couples to marry freely. Spouses now have additional
options for changing their names after marriage or after entering into registered domestic
partnerships. The court was provided authority to divide survivor benefits in additional types of
pension plans. The legislature continued addressing the need to restrict access to parties' personal
information contained in judgments as statewide implementation of e-Court continues.
All bills are effective January 1, 2016, unless stated otherwise.

ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT PROCEEDINGS

A.

HB 3156A (ch 72)

Temporary suspension of enforcement of child support upon
change in physical custody

ORS Chapter 25 sets forth the framework for enforcement of child support obligations.
Under current law, the Oregon Child Support Program (CSP) may suspend enforcement of child
support obligations only when continued enforcement will result in a credit. HB 3156A provides
authority to temporarily suspend enforcement regardless of whether continued enforcement will
result in a credit balance, but only if all of the children are residing with the obligor and continued
collection of support would impair the obligor’s ability to provide direct support to the children. The
CSP may only suspend enforcement if an action is currently pending to terminate, vacate, or set aside
a support order, or to modify a support order because of a change in physical custody of the children.
The obligee may object within 14 days of receiving notice of the CSP’s intent to suspend
enforcement of the support order, but may only objection on the following limited grounds:
1.
2.
3.

The child is not in the physical custody of the obligor;
The child is in the physical custody of the obligor, but without the consent of the
obligee; or
The basis for the suspension of enforcement is factually incorrect.

Suspension of collection efforts in cases where the children have moved from residing
primarily with the obligee to the obligor enables for a streamlined process through which the new
primary residential parent can divert money from the other parent and instead utilize those resources
for the children’s benefit.
B.

HB 3158 (ch 73)

Removes time limitation on judgments in cases involving multiple
child support judgments

HB 2275 (2005 legislative session) dealt with cases involving multiple child support
Page 4 of 18

judgments. That bill provided that the terms of a later-issued judgment control and the earlier
judgment is automatically terminated, but only if several factors are met, including:
1.

The court (or administrator) specifically ordered that the later-issued judgment would
take precedence over the earlier issued judgment;

2.

All parties had an opportunity to challenge the later-issued judgment;

3.

The administrator was providing enforcement services.

3.

The two child support judgments involved the same obligor, child, and time period;
and

4.

The later-issued child support judgment be entered before January 1, 2004.

HB 3158 removes the requirement that a later-issued child support judgment be entered
before January 1, 2004, and changes the requirement that the administrator was providing services
to a requirement that the administrator is providing services. These changes provide the Oregon
Child Support Program with the ability to provide prompt enforcement of the most recent ordered
entered involving the parties.
C.

HB 3159 (ch 74)

Permits state to recover from any person or entity that issues a
dishonored check as payment for child support

HB 3159 amends ORS 25.125 to provide that the state may recover from any person or entity
that issues a dishonored check for payment of child support. Under current law, the state is permitted
to recover only from the obligor or the withholder who presented the check (i.e., obligor's employer).
The bill clarifies that the state may recover from either the obligor or the issuer.
III.

ADOPTIVE PROCEEDINGS

A.

HB 2365 (ch 511)

Creation of a re-adoption process

Prior to passage of HB 2365, Oregon law lacked a statutory process for re-adoptions. A re-

Page 5 of 18

adoption occurs when adoptive parents travel to a different country and complete the adoption of
their child in that country. Many parents wish to re-adopt their child upon their return to Oregon in
order to obtain an Oregon birth certificate, change their child’s name, or change their child’s birth
date. Federal law provides that a Federal Certificate of Citizenship for a child born outside of the
United States shall reflect the child’s name and date of birth as indicated on a state court order or
state vital records document issued by the child’s state of residence after the child has been adopted.
The lack of a clear re-adoption process in Oregon presented difficulties for families attempting to
clear this legal hurdle upon their return to Oregon with their newly adopted child.
Prior to passage of HB 2365, re-adoption processes informally adopted in Oregon by one
county might differ from that found in other counties. HB 2365 amends ORS 109.385 to provide a
specific step-by-step process for a re-adoption proceeding in Oregon that ensures a consistent
statewide standard.
This bill became effective as of June 22, 2015.
B.

HB 2366 (ch 512)

Adoption filing fees

HB 2366 provides for an increase in the filing fee for a petition in an adoption proceeding
from $252 to $255. Under current law, the petitioner must pay a $252 filing fee when filing the
petition, but must then pay an additional $1 fee once the adoption is finalized for issuance of the
Court Certificate of Adoption. HB 2366 combines those two fees in an effort to streamline the
administrative process involved in the adoption process. The additional $2 increase in the fee reflects
that the court may no longer charge for issuing certificates of adoption and must, in fact, issue “one
or more” certificates once the adoption process is complete.
HB 2366 additionally imposes a filing fee (set forth in ORS 21.145, which is currently $105)
Page 6 of 18

for a motion filed by the birth parent of an adult adoptee under Oregon’s new open adoption records
law, except in cases where DHS consented to the adoption.
C.

HB 2414 (ch 200)

Use and registry with voluntary adoption registries

HB 2414 permits parents or guardians of minor adoptees or minor genetic siblings of
adoptees to use and register with voluntary adoption registries. Under existing law, minor siblings
are restricted from utilizing the mandatory adoption search and registry program unless the minor
child’s birth parent has already registered with the program, the birth parent approves of the use and
registry, and all adoptees and siblings have reached the age of 18. HB 2414 amends ORS Chapter
109 to provide that a minor child’s adoptive parent may opt in to the search and registry program on
the child’s behalf in an effort to locate a sibling of the minor child, unless the other sibling presently
resides with the birth parent. This change in the law provides an avenue for siblings separated by
adoption to locate each other with the assistance of their adoptive parents without having to wait
until reaching the age of majority.
HB 2414 additionally provides an avenue for children of a deceased adult adoptee to access
the search and registry program. Under existing law, the child of an adult adoptee had no
independent access to the program, which meant that if the adult adoptee (i.e., parent) died without
having ever utilized the program, the child would be left with no readily available avenue to contact
family members. HB 2414 permits a child of a deceased adult adoptee to utilize the program so as
to promote access to previously unknown family members.
D.

SB 741 (ch 795)

Requires Oregon DHS to adopt administrative rules for adoption
proceedings that require equal consideration be given to relatives
and current caretakers as prospective adoptive parents

Under current law governing adoption proceedings there is no expressed placement
Page 7 of 18

preference. Instead, adoption statutes recite the general "best interests of the child" standard as to
where the child ought to be placed. SB 741 requires that the administrative rules governing home
studies and placement reports to provide equal status and priority to relatives and current caretakers
seeking to adopt as is provided other prospective adoptive parents with regard to factors having to
do with the child's safety, attachment, and well-being. Additionally, SB 741 requires that with regard
to suitability of placement, the rules include a preference for relatives and current caretakers over
other individuals seeking to adopt.
This bill became effective as of July 27, 2015.
IV.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES

A.

HB 2628 (ch 89)

Disallows fees in action for stalking protective order

Existing law provides that a petitioner seeking a Stalking Protective Order (SPO) without
also seeking damages shall be exempted from filing fees, service fees, and hearing fees. HB 2628
extends the exemption of fees to all persons seeking SPOs, regardless of whether additional relief
(i.e., monetary damages) is sought.
This bill became effective as of May 18, 2015.
B.

HB 2776 (252)

Application of emergency protective order by peace officer

ORS 107.700 through 107.735 provides the statutory framework for a Family Abuse
Prevention Act (FAPA) restraining order. In order to receive an order of restraint, a victim of abuse
must file a petition with the court and subsequently attend a hearing either by telephone or in person.
This process presents possible barriers for individuals who may be in need of protective orders of
restraint during a time the court is not in session (and may not be in session for a number of days).
HB 2776 authorizes a peace officer to request an emergency protective order on a victim’s
Page 8 of 18

behalf that operates much like a traditional FAPA restraining order, albeit on a more restrictive basis.
In order to request such an order, the peace officer must first obtain the victim’s consent. The peace
officer must then make a showing that probable cause exists that: (1) the peace officer has responded
to an incident of domestic disturbance and the circumstances for mandatory arrest exist; or that a
person is in immediate danger; and (2) an emergency protective order is necessary to prevent a
person from suffering the occurrence or recurrence of abuse.
An emergency protective order entered pursuant to this new law is effective upon service of
the respondent, but automatically expires seven calendar days from the date the court signs the order
or upon further order of the court.
Note: The presiding judge of the circuit court in each county shall designate at least one
judge to be reasonably available to enter, in person or by electronic transmission, ex parte
emergency protective orders at all times whether or not the court is in session.
C.

HB 3476 (ch 265)

Establishes privilege for certain communications between victims
of domestic violence and advocates

The privilege of confidentiality exists in a whole host of relationships involving positions of
confidence (e.g., doctor-patient, psychologist-patient, lawyer-client, husband-wife, etc.). The rules
for confidentiality are set forth in ORS 40.225 through 40.295 in the Oregon Evidence Code.
HB 3476 creates a new type of communications privilege protected under the Oregon
Evidence Code. The bill provides that confidential communications between a victim of sexual
assault, domestic violence, or stalking, and victim advocates or services programs are protected
communications that are inadmissible in civil, criminal, administrative, and school proceedings. The
victim holds the privilege, but consistent with other protected privileges, the communication may

Page 9 of 18

be disclosed by the advocate or program without the victim's consent to the extent necessary for
defense in any civil, criminal, or administrative action that is brought against the advocate or
program by or on behalf of the victim.
This bill became effective as of June 4, 2015.
D.

SB 525 (ch 497)

Prohibits possession of firearm or ammunition by certain persons

SB makes it unlawful for a person to knowingly possess a firearm or ammunition if the
person is the subject of a court order that was issued or continued after a hearing for which the
person had actual notice and during which the person had an opportunity to be heard, and restrains
the person from stalking, intimidating, molesting, or menacing an intimate partner, child of an
intimate partner, or child of the person. Additionally, the order must make a finding that the person
represents a credible threat to the physical safety of an intimate partner, a child of an intimate
partner, or a child of the person, or the person has been convicted of a qualifying misdemeanor1 and,
at the time of the offense, the person was a family member of the victim of the offense.
SB 525 essentially creates a state crime that mirrors current federal crime prohibiting
possession of a firearm or ammunition by adjudicated domestic violence offenders. Creation of a
state crime provides local law enforcement officers the authority to take action. With federal law as
the only barrier to firearm possession, local law enforcement officers were unable to readily act in
these types of cases.

1

A qualifying misdemeanor must have, as an element of the offense, the use or attempted use of physical
force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.

OTHER DOMESTIC RELATIONS BILLS

A.

HB 2478 (ch 629)

Achieves gender neutrality in marriage statutes and related laws

U.S. District Court Judge Michael McShane ruled on May 19, 2014, that Oregon’s
constitutional ban on marriages between gay and lesbian couples was unconstitutional. In response
to that ruling, HB 2478 amends a host of statutes to reflect that same-sex couples now have the
freedom to marry by making statutory language referring to married couples more gender neutral.
B.

HB 3015 (ch 425)

Creates additional options for changing name after marriage or
after entering into registered domestic partnership

ORS 106.220 provides authority for a party entering into marriage to make changes to that
party’s name. The statute specifies various naming options, including retaining a party’s surname,
changing a surname to the other party’s surname or combining surnames with a hyphen. ORS
106.335 sets forth similar authority and rules in the context of registered domestic partnerships.
HB 3015 amends both ORS 106.220 and 106.335 to clarify that a party may take only one
surname, or a combination of multiple surnames of either or both parties.
This bill became effective as of June 16, 2015.
C.

SB 321 (ch 234)

Decreases compulsory school age from seven to six years of age

SB 321 decreases the compulsory school age from seven to six years of age as of September
1 immediately preceding the beginning of the current school term.
This bill becomes effective as of July 1, 2016.
D.

SB 370 (ch 506)

Provides for division of certain death benefits in judgment of
annulment, dissolution of marriage, or separation

ORS 238.465 provides for payment of PERS benefits to an alternate payee on divorce,
annulment or unlimited separation. ORS 237.600 deals with payment of benefits from a member of
Page 11 of 18

other state and local public retirement plans other than PERS. The aim of SB 370 was to protect
survivor benefits for former spouses of members in a public retirement plan. Where the terms of the
retirement plan provide that the spouse is entitled to survivor benefits if the member dies before
retirement, then logic dictates that entitlement should not be deprived by the plan just because the
parties become divorced. The plan should still be required to continue that survivor benefit to the
former spouse to the extent provided in a court order. The plan is already committed to provide that
benefit to the spouse while the parties are married. To be relieved of providing that benefit due to
divorce of the parties creates a windfall to the plan and deprives a former spouse of an important
protection.
This dynamic is exactly what happened in Rose v. Board of Trustees for the Portland Fire
& Police Disability and Retirement Fund.2 In the Rose case, Wife divorced Husband (a firefighter
with the City of Portland) when he was age 46 and by Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)
she was awarded a survivor benefit should he die before retirement. Husband then died of cancer at
age 47, not having remarried, less than three years before his early retirement date at age 50. The
City denied survivor benefits to Wife and she received nothing. After a long fight at the City and
then through the Multnomah County Circuit Court, the Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed the City's
position. The entire benefit earned by husband during his 20-year career reverted back to the City,
save the partial benefit that was paid to the parties' minor child under the terms of the plan. The
City's attorneys admitted that Wife would have received a survivor benefit if either: (1) the parties
had not divorced; or (2) Husband had remarried someone else before he died at age 47 so that a
survivor benefit was payable under the terms of the plan; or (3) he had survived to age 50 before he
2

215 Or App 138, 168 P3d 1204 (2007).

Page 12 of 18

retired. However, because the parties divorced and Husband died single before age 50, Wife
received nothing.
The Rose case turned on the specific language of ORS 237.600(1), which states in relevant
part:
" . . . payment of any . . . death benefit . . . under any public employer retirement plan
. . . that would otherwise be made to a person entitled to benefits under the plan
shall be paid, in whole or in part, to an alternate payee if and to the extent expressly
provided for in the terms of any court decree . . . ." Emphasis added.
The plan argued, and the court held, that because there is no survivor benefit at all on the
death of a single person under the City of Portland plan, then a survivor benefit cannot be paid to
Wife in the Rose case. It did not matter that the parties had been married and that she was entitled
to the survivor benefit while married. By virtue of the divorce, she automatically lost that benefit
notwithstanding the terms of the dissolution judgment or the subsequently entered QDRO.
At each level in Rose, Wife argued that the statute should be read to mean " . . . that would
otherwise be made but for the divorce . . ." as was the intent, but to no avail. Wife pointed to
legislative history that demonstrated the intent of the statute was to make Oregon law co-extensive
with federal law (i.e., ERISA) as it applies to private sector plans. ERISA provides plainly that a
survivor benefit to which a spouse is entitled can be perpetuated after the divorce to the extent
provided in a QDRO. Wife also pointed out that during the hearings for the bill enacting this very
statute (Senate Bill 210) in 1993, the attorney for the City of Portland plan testified to the Legislature
on this very issue, complaining that the bill would require the City of Portland plan to provide a
benefit to a former spouse that it didn't then provide. Notwithstanding the City's complaints, the
Legislature made no changes to the bill and passed it anyway. Wife in Rose, therefore, argued that,

Page 13 of 18

implicitly at least, the Legislature intended the statute to require that survivor benefits be continued
a former spouse if so ordered. Wife ultimately lost that argument, with the Court of Appeals ruling
that legislative history was irrelevant because the statute was plain on its face.
This issue remained dead from 2007 when the Court of Appeals issues its ruling until only
recently when Oregon PERS took the position that a divorced member of OPSRP (Oregon Public
Service Retirement Plan, ORS Chapter 238A) who remains single cannot designate a former spouse
to receive survivor benefits -- at all. Only if the member remarries a second spouse can the member
be required to provide benefits to a first spouse.
By contrast, PERS Tier One and Tier Two allow survivor benefits to anyone - they are not
restricted just to a spouse, much less a former spouse.
SB 370 amended Oregon law to require that the Oregon PERS OPSRP plan and other public
employer retirement plans pay out a survivor benefit to a former spouse of the member as provided
in a judgment or order.
This bill became effective as of June 19, 2015.

SB 604 (ch 298)

Adoption of amendments to the Uniform Interstate Family
Support Act

As part of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (Public Law 113183), Congress required all states to enact any amendments to the Uniform Interstate Family Support
Act (UIFSA). The amendments at issue were adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners
on Uniform State Laws in 2008. SB 604 enacts all of the amendments to UIFSA, which will result
in the following changes to the law in Oregon:
1.

Improved enforcement of U.S. child support orders abroad and more assurance of
children residing in the U.S. receiving support from parents living abroad.
Page 14 of 18

F.

2.

Adoption of new guidelines and procedures for the registration, enforcement, and
modification of foreign support order from countries that are parties to the Hague
Convention.

3.

Additional flexibility for the modification of orders when the state or country that
issued the order cannot or will not process a modification.

SB 622 (ch 179)

Abuse reporting requirement

SB 622 amends ORS 124.050 and other mandatory abuse reporting statutes to include
personal support workers and home care workers.
G.

SB 659 (ch 393)

Requires Oregon DHS to assist noncustodial parents in obtaining
home and community-based services for nonresident child

SB 659 creates new law that requires the Oregon Department of Human Services to assist
in obtaining home and community-based services for a parent's child if:
1.

The parent resides in Oregon;

2.

The parent has a child who does not reside in Oregon but who visits the parent in
Oregon for at least six weeks (need not be consecutive) each year; and

3.

The child qualifies for home and community-based services via Medicaid in the
child's state of residence.

Creation of this new law is an important layer of protection for Oregon non-custodial parents
with children who live out of state and receive home and community-based services via Medicaid
because it can be difficult to maintain those services without interruption for children who spend
significant amounts of time out of their home states.

HB 2340 (ch 197)

Protecting personal information contained in judgments

The continuing statewide implementation of e-Court has brought forth a variety of concerns
regarding the public’s growing access to court documents that contain sensitive personal information
of litigants. HB 2340 operates to further the goal of protecting the personal information of litigants
Page 15 of 18

by limiting the information that must be required in court documents by amending a number of
statutory provisions that previously required the inclusion of complete Social Security Numbers,
Taxpayer Identification Numbers, and driver license numbers.
HB 2340 targets four individual types of documents:
1.

Civil judgments (including judgments arising from dissolution and child
support proceedings) containing a money award must now only include the last
four digits of a judgment debtor’s Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). Note that
ORS 18.042 previously allowed for the exclusion of all but the last four digits of the
debtor’s Social Security Number (SSN), but the IRS defines TINs as including SSNs,
which could lead to confusion. HB 2340 creates consistency in the type of
information that ought to be excluded from judgments and protected from the
public’s view.

2.

Lien record abstracts were subjected to a similar change and must now only
included the last four digits of a judgment debtor’s TIN (or SSN).

3.

Paternity and support judgments and orders must now only include the final four
digits of each party’s SSN and driver license number.

4.

Criminal judgments relating to the payment of restitution and compensatory
fines to victims of crime must now exclude the victim’s name and address.

This bill became effective as of June 2, 2015.

SB 788 (ch 399)

Requires disclosure in petition for annulment, dissolution, or
separation to disclose certain protective and restraining orders

SB 788 amends ORS 107.085 to provide that a petitioner in an action for marital annulment,
dissolution, or separation must state whether there exists in Oregon or any jurisdiction a protective
order between the parties or any other order that restrains one of the parties from contact with the
other party or with the parties' minor children.
J.

HB 2570 (ch 99)

Attorney fees in protective proceedings (Derkatsch fix)

In 2013, the legislature enacted HB 2570 and modified ORS 125.095 to provide the court

Page 16 of 18

specific authority to use the funds of a person subject to a protective proceeding to pay for attorney
fees incurred prior to the court declaring the person protected. The bill also made clear that the
procedures set forth in ORCP 68 do not apply to requests for approval and payment of attorney fees
under ORS 125.095. Instead, HB 2570 created a list of ten distinct factors for the court to consider
when determining whether to award fees, and an additional six factors to consider in determining
the appropriate amount of fees to award. HB 2570 stated quite clearly that none of the factors set
forth in ORS 125.095 should be controlling in the court’s determination regarding attorney fees.
This 2013 legislation was in response to a ruling by the Oregon Court of Appeals that ORS
125.095 does not authorize the payment of attorney fees incurred before a protective order has been
entered for services rendered in a financial abuse case brought on the protected person's behalf.3 In
other words, prior to the passage of HB 2570 in the 2013 session, attorneys were restricted from
receiving payment for the pre-order work they undertook on a potential protected person's behalf
(e.g., legal research, drafting petitions and other paperwork, court appearances, etc.), even if that
person was subsequently deemed by the court to have been in need of protection.
Shortly after implementation of HB 2570 and the resulting amendments to ORS 125.095,
practitioners recognized that the court should appropriate consider one factor above all the others
– “[t]he benefit to the person subject to the protective proceeding by the party’s actions in the
proceeding.” HB 2362 amends ORS 125.095 to provide courts the authority to elevate that singular
factor above the rest in recognition of the fact that fees are often awarded out of the assets of the
protected person. It can often be cost prohibitive for a protected person to bring an action before the
court because of the possibility that fees might be paid to all affected parties. HB 2362 affords courts
3

In re Derkatsch, 248 Or App 185, 273 P2d 204 (2012).

Page 17 of 18

the opportunity to consider first and foremost the benefit to the person subject to the protective
proceeding in determining whether an award of fees is appropriate at all.

Recent Significant Decisions
in Family Law
Judge James C. “Jim” Egan
Oregon Court of Appeals Position 6
I would like to thank Gary Zimmer who summarized some of the material below in
conjunction with his “recent significant decisions” published by the Multnomah Bar Association
last spring. I would also like to thank Jordan New for material that he summarized this summer.
1. Child Custody
a. Modification of Custody Where a Grandparent is the Custodian.
Epler and Epler, 356 Or 624 (2014) was issued on December 26, 2014.
Richard Alway argued for Petitioner (mother) and Mark Kramer argued for
Respondent (grandparents). Justice Baldwin delivered the opinion of the court.

Mother and Father were divorced in 2005 through a stipulated dissolution
judgment which granted custody of their daughter to her grandmother. Mother
sought to modify that agreement, arguing she was entitled to a legal presumption
in her favor that she acted in her child’s best interests. The trial court found that
modification of the agreement would not be in the child’s best interests, and that
there had not been a substantial change in circumstances warranting modification.
The Court of Appeals (full court) affirmed the trial court’s denial of mother’s
motions. The Court held that mother was not entitled to a legal presumption
because there were not concerns about due process as present in Troxel v.
Granville. The Court found the trial court had not abused its discretion in finding
a change of custody was not in the best interests of the child; as a result, mother
was not harmed by being held to the standard which requires a change in
circumstances to modify a dissolution agreement. Court of Appeals affirmed; trial
court affirmed and reversed in part. Remanded to the circuit court to rule on
mother’s request to modify parenting time and child support.

b. Lifestyle Choices or a Parent: ORS 107.137(3).
Miller and Miller, 269 Or App 436 (2015) was issued on March 4, 2015.
Beth Eiva argued in reply and Sarah Peterson wrote the opening brief for
Appellant (wife). James A. Palmer argued for Respondent (husband). Judge
Armstrong delivered the opinion of the court.

1|Page

The Court of Appeals reversed the custody award and remanded with
instructions to enter a judgment awarding custody to mother. The trial court’s
conclusion that factor (f) favored father impermissibly considered mother’s
lifestyle choices. The court noted that ORS 107.137(3) permits consideration of
such lifestyle factors only if they will or may cause damage to the child. The trial
court did not make any findings that mother’s lifestyle choices presented any risk
of emotional or physical damage, nor could any such findings be inferred from the
record. The Court noted that the trial judge’s ruling was based on disapproval of
mother’s recent choices, particularly becoming pregnant by her boyfriend, and did
not reflect an attempt to explain how those choices might damage the children.
Mother’s choices fell far short of the standard that ORS 107.137(3) imposes
before the court may factor parental lifestyle choices into its custody award.
Reversed and remanded.
c. Status as a Parent: ORS 109.243.
Madrone and Madrone, 271 Or App 116 (2015) was issued on May 13, 2015.
John C. Howry argued for Appellant (wife) and Thomas A. Bittner argued for
Respondent (wife). Judge Hadlock delivered the opinion of the court.
In this case, the court considered how to determine whether an unmarried
same-sex couple is similarly situated to a married opposite-sex couple for
purposes of ORS 109.243 and, thus, entitled to the privilege granted by that
statute. ORS 109.243 creates parentage in the husband of a woman who bears a
child conceived by artificial insemination if the husband consented to that
insemination. The statute’s effect is automatic; it requires no judicial or
administrative filings or proceedings. In Shineovich and Kemp, 229 Or App 670,
rev den, 347 Or 365 (2009), the court held that the statute violated Article I,
section 20, of the Oregon Constitution because it granted a privilege—parentage
by operation of law—on the basis of sexual orientation, because it applied only to
married couples and because, when the court decided Shineovich, same-sex
couples were not permitted to marry in Oregon. To remedy the violation, the court
extended the statute “so that it applies when the same-sex partner of the biological
mother consented to the artificial insemination.” Id. at 687. It was undisputed that
the parties in Shineovich were similarly situated to a married opposite-sex couple,
so the court did not consider to which same-sex couples the extension of ORS
109.243 applies.
This case raised that question. During the parties’relationship, respondent
gave birth to a daughter, R, who was conceived by artificial insemination. Shortly
thereafter, the Oregon Family Fairness Act took effect, allowing same-sex couples
to register domestic partnerships, which petitioner and respondent then did. They
later separated, and petitioner brought this action for dissolution of the domestic
partnership. Among other claims, petitioner sought a declaration that she is R’s
legal parent by operation of ORS 109.243. The trial court granted summary

2|Page

judgment for petitioner on that claim based on our analysis in Shineovich.
Respondent appealed. The Court of Appeals concluded that ORS 109.243 applied
to unmarried same-sex couples who have a child through artificial insemination if
the partner of the biological parent consented to the insemination and the couple
would have chosen to marry had that choice been available to them. The record in
this case includes evidence creating a genuine dispute on the latter point.
Accordingly, the trial court erred in entering summary judgment. Reversed.
As an interesting side note, the press widely reported this case as a loss to the
LGBTQ community. From my perspective, it placed the question of the
voluntary nature of artificial insemination in exactly the same posture as
heterosexual couples.

2. Child Support.
a. Calculation.
Morgan and Morgan, 269 Or App 156 (2015) was issued on February 11, 2015.
George Kelly argued for Appellant (wife) and Russell Lipetzky argued for
Respondent (wife). Judge Flynn delivered the opinion of the court.
Wife appealed a judgment of dissolution, challenging the trial court’s
division of the parties’ property, spousal support award, and determination of
child support. The Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not err in its
property division or spousal support award. However, the trial court’s calculation
of the child support obligation failed to take into account its finding with regard to
wife’s disability at the time of the trial. As a result, the trial court erred as a
matter of law in calculating wife’s presumed income for child support purposes.
Award of child support reversed and remanded for calculation. Otherwise,
affirmed.
__________
State of Oregon v. Nguyen, 268 Or App 789 (2015) was decided on February 4,
2015.
George Kelly argued for Appellant (father) and Denise G. Fjordbeck waived
appearance for Respondent (State of Oregon). Judge Hadlock delivered the
opinion of the court.
Father, a Georgia chicken farmer, appealed a judgment requiring him to
pay child support, contending that the trial court erred in determining the
appropriate amount of support. The Court of Appeals concluded that the trial
court erred (1) in finding that father’s income was $1,500 per month and (2) in
relying on factual findings that father lived with his ex-wife and that he had

3|Page

access to money whenever he wanted. These findings were speculative and were
not substantiated by any evidence. Reversed and remanded for redetermination of
father’s income and reconsideration of whether rebuttal is appropriate and, if so,
the amount.
b. Contempt of Court.
Altenhofen and Vanden-Busch, 271 Or App 57 (2015) was issued on May 13,
2015.
Daniel C. Bennett, Senior Public Defender, argued for Appellant (husband) and
Cecil A. Reniche-Smith, Senior Assistant Attorney General, argued for
Respondent (State of Oregon). Judge Sercombe delivered the opinion of the
court.
Defendant appealed the trial court’s judgment finding him in contempt for
failure to pay child support and imposing 60 months of bench probation. He
contended that the trial court erred in finding him in contempt and that the court
“plainly erred when it imposed a determinate term of probation on the basis of
proceedings that were not conducted as provided in the punitive contempt
statute.” The Court of Appeals rejected defendant’s contention that the trial court
erred in holding him in contempt (remedial), but agreed that the court committed
plain error in imposing a determinate term of probation (punative).
As an interesting side note, appellant received a $5,000 settlement and a
$3,000 gift during this time and the court noted that he had not applied any of that
money to his back child support and further noted that even that money would not
have cured the problem. Accordingly, the court reversed and remanded the
portion of the judgment that imposed a punitive contempt sanction, and otherwise
affirmed.
3. Child Name Change – Minor.
Stoecklin and Crippen, 265 Or App 662 (2014) was issued on October 1, 2014.
Philip F. Schuster argued for Appellant (wife) and Mark Johnson Roberts argued
for Respondent (husband). Judge Ortega delivered the opinion of the court.
Mother and father were separated but still married when their son was
born and mother gave the child her maiden name, Crippen. After entry of a
judgment that dissolved their marriage and awarded legal custody to mother,
father petitioned the trial court to change the child’s last name to Stoecklin.
Husband had ultimately been convicted of felony assault. At the FAPA hearing
on the assault, he questioned the child’s paternity. The trial court concluded that
mother had given the child her maiden name out of anger and shock and that
changing the child’s name would prevent the father from being disincorporated

4|Page

and disenfranchised from the child. The Court of Appeals held that the trial
court’s findings and the evidence cited were either irrelevant or lacked any
evidentiary support in the way of determining the best interests of the child.
Reversed.
4. Spousal Support.
a. Maintenance v. Transitional.
DeAngeles and DeAngeles, 273 Or App 88 (2015) was issued on August 19,
2015.
Helen C. Tompkins argued for Appellant (husband) and George W. Kelly argued
for Respondent (wife). Judge Nakamoto delivered the opinion of the court.
Husband and wife were married for 17 years. The trial court awarded
husband transitional spousal support of $1,000 per month for two years. The
limited period of support was based on evidence that wife’s job would only last
two more years. On appeal, husband argued that spousal support should have
been higher and for a longer duration. The Court of Appeals remanded the case
for reconsideration of the spousal support awarded because the trial court made no
findings to support an award of transitional support.
There are two items of note in this opinion. First, the trial court likely
intended to award maintenance spousal support instead of transitional spousal
support. In its written opinion, the trial court specified that it was awarding
maintenance support, but the Judgment that the court signed specified transitional
spousal support. This was likely simply an error on the part of the parties who
created the Judgment, but it highlights the importance of consistency between the
Judgment language and the court’s orders.
Second, the Court of Appeals suggested that the trial court on remand review
the decision to award support that terminates after two years. The Court of
Appeals expressed concern over the duration because it was based on a
“speculative contingency.” Specifically, that wife would no longer have a job in
two years.
_______________
Justice v. Crum, 265 Or App 635 (2014) was issued on September 24, 2014.
Lorena Reynolds argued for Appellant (wife) and Neil Crum briefed pro se.
Judge Schuman delivered the opinion of the court.
Wife appealed a dissolution judgment that awarded her maintenance support
of $300 per month for 36 months and no transitional support. In denying wife’s
request for transitional support, the trial court asserted that to award transitional
support, wife must present a “specific plan” so that the court can consider whether

5|Page

transitional support is appropriate. Wife failed to present a “specific plan” and her
request was denied.
On appeal, wife assigned error to the trial court’s denial of her request for
transitional support. She also argued that the maintenance support award was
inadequate. The Court of Appeals rejected her argument regarding the
maintenance support award without discussion but went on to find that the trial
court failed to apply the statutory transitional support factors, which was an error
of law. Remanded for Reconsideration of transitional support.
b. Spousal Support: Insurance.
Mitchell and Mitchell, 271 Or App 800 (2015) was issued on June 17, 2015.
Jeffery Potter argued for Appellant (husband) and Nathan J. Ratliff argued for
Respondent (wife). Judge Tookey delivered the opinion of the court.
In Mitchell and Mitchell, 271 Or App 800 (2015), the trial court did not
provide an explanation for why it chose to require Husband to maintain a
$750,000 life insurance policy while he was paying support and then a $250,000
policy for the rest of his life. The Court of Appeals, which reversed the trial
court’s ruling regarding support amounts as well, requested that the trial court on
remand to articulate its decision regarding life insurance.
____________
Moyer and Moyer, 271 Or App 853 (2015) was issued on June 17, 2015.
Kimberly A. Quach argued for Appellant (husband) and John Moore argued for
Respondent (wife). This is a Per Curiam decision (probably written by Presiding
Judge Ortega).
Moyer and Moyer is a reminder to the trial courts that details matter. Husband
filed a motion to terminate or modify the spousal support he was previously
ordered to pay, based on his retirement. The court modified the support award to
be stepped down each year and terminate after three years. The life insurance
policy requirements, however, were not modified. The Court of Appeals reversed
and remanded the trial court’s decision to modify husband’s life insurance
obligation, holding that the obligation “must be commensurate with the ordered
spousal support.”
c. Spousal Support: Work Life and Retirement.
Logan and Logan, 270 Or App 176 (2015) was issued on April 1, 2015.
Laura Graser argued for Appellant (husband) and Russell Lipetzky argued for
Respondent (wife). Judge Duncan delivered the opinion of the court.

6|Page

Husband appealed a dissolution judgment that, among other provisions,
requires him to pay $4,000 a month in maintenance support to wife until 2027—
by which time he will be nearly 79 years old. Husband, an oral surgeon, argued
that the assumption underlying that award of spousal support – namely, that he
would continue to work as a surgeon until age 79 – is not supported by any
evidence in the record. He further argued that it is not just and equitable to
essentially force him to work until that age to pay the obligation. The Court of
Appeals opined that the evidence could be interpreted to read that husband would
continue to work indefinitely and that he could modify if his circumstances
changed. Affirmed.
5. Property Division.
a. Full Disclosure.
Pollock and Pollock, 357 Or 575 (2015) was issued on July 30, 2015.
William Valet argued for Petitioner (wife) and Helen C. Tompkins argued for
Respondent (husband). Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court.
The issue in this case is whether discovery of the parties’ assets must be
provided in a marital dissolution action after the parties have entered into a
settlement agreement but before the trial court has ruled on a contested motion to
enforce the agreement. The Supreme Court concluded that the trial court in this
case did not satisfy its duty under ORS 107.105(1)(f)(F) to ensure that the parties
had fully disclosed their assets before it decided husband’s motion to enforce a
mediated agreement and entered a judgment of dissolution based on that decision.
Accordingly, they reversed that portion of the decision by the Court of Appeals
that upheld the trial court’s discovery ruling, vacated the remainder of the Court
of Appeals decision, and reversed the judgment of dissolution and remanded the
case to the circuit court for further proceedings.
b. Calculation.
Fine and Fine, 272 Or App 307 (2015) was issued on July 15, 2015.
George W. Kelly argued for Appellant (husband) and Amanda R. Benjamin
argued for Respondent (wife). Judge Tookey delivered the opinion of the court.
On July 15, 2015, the Court of Appeals published an opinion relating to the
division of marital property. In Fine and Fine, 272 Or App 307 (2015), several
pieces of real estate and one business were divided. The Court of Appeals found
error in two facets of the trial court’s division of assets.
First, the trial court failed to account for roughly $140,000 in withdrawals
wife made from a joint account immediately before the parties separated and

7|Page

about two years before trial. The trial court found that wife “did not account for
her disposition of these funds,” but noted that wife had been maintaining the
marital residence during the separation. The mortgage, insurance, and taxes for
the marital residence during the separation totaled about $49,000, but the
remainder of the funds were unaccounted for. Husband asked that he be
reimbursed for half of the funds withdrawn, but the trial court denied the request.
The Court of Appeals sent the issue of the disposition of those funds back to the
trial court, finding that there was no evidence to support the trial court’s findings
that all of the funds were used to maintain the marital residence.
In its second finding of error, the Court of Appeals examined $165,000 that
was paid from a joint account during the marriage toward debts of wife’s
business, which was awarded to wife in the dissolution. Husband argued that he
should be reimbursed for half of the joint funds used to pay the business
debt. The trial court denied the request, but the Court of Appeals disagreed,
remanding to the trial court for reconsideration of the award of the business to
wife without any compensation to husband.
_______________
Cirina and Cirina, 271 Or App 161 (2015) was issued on May 13, 2015.
George Kelly argued for Appellant (husband) and Respondent made no
appearance. Judge Lagesen delivered the opinion of the court.
In this property/debt division case, husband’s father paid off the $130,000
mortgage on the parties’ home during the marriage. Husband presented a
promissory note to repay his father the $130,000, signed only by husband. The
trial court held that husband was responsible for the entire debt, primarily because
wife had not signed the promissory note. The Court of Appeals held that the trial
court applied the wrong analysis to the debt, explaining that marital debts are
presumptively divided evenly between the parties, even without one of the party’s
signature. The case was remanded to the trial court to determine whether the debt
should be considered marital or personal.
_______________
Hostetler and Hostetler, 269 Or App 312 (2015) was issued on February 25,
2015.
Richard F. Always argued for Appellant and Russell Lipetzky argued for
Respondent. Judge Duncan delivered the opinion of the court.
Husband appealed from a dissolution judgment, assigning error to the trial
court’s property division and its denial of his request for attorney fees. With
respect to the property division, husband argued that the trial court erred by
failing to give him one half of the marital asset portion of wife’s retirement
accounts and by assigning all of the marital debt to him. The Court of Appeals
concluded that, contrary to husband’s arguments, the trial court engaged in the

8|Page

process contemplated by ORS 107.105(1)(f) (2008) and properly exercised its
discretion in determining a just and proper division of the parties’ assets and
liabilities. With respect to the attorney fees, husband argued that the trial court
erred by failing to explain its denial of his request for attorney fees. The court
concluded that, because husband did not request, as required by ORCP 68
(C)(4)(g), that the trial court state its findings of fact and conclusions of law on
the record, the court did not err in failing to do so. Affirmed.
_______________
Davis and Davis, 268 Or App 679 (2015) was issued on January 28, 2015.
George W. Kelly argued for Appellant and Guy B. Greco argued for Respondent.
Judge Tookey delivered the opinion of the court.
Husband appealed a general judgment of dissolution challenging the trial
court’s division of the parties’ property. Husband argued that the trial court erred
in determining that he did not rebut the presumption of equal contribution
regarding money that he received from a personal injury settlement. The Court of
Appeals held that the trial court’s determination that husband failed to rebut the
presumption of equal contribution was based on a misapplication of ORS
107.105(1)(f) and relevant case law. Specifically, the appellate court ruled that
before deciding whether husband rebutted the presumption of equal contribution,
the trial court must determine whether “wife had any part in the action or
settlement or claimed any damages for loss of consortium.” 268 Or App at 686.
Property division vacated and remanded for reconsideration. Otherwise, affirmed.
6. Stipulated Agreements and Judgments.
a. Enforceability of Agreements.
Hoogendam and Hoogendam, 273 Or App 219 (2015) was issued on August 19,
2015.
Margaret H. Leek Leiberan argued for Appellant (wife) and Brent J. Goodfellow
argued for Respondent (husband). Judge Tookey delivered the opinion of the
court.
Wife appealed a judgment entitled “Stipulated General Judgment of
Dissolution of Marriage,” and argued that the court erred by entering that
judgment because it was not signed or agreed to by both parties and it
incorporated documents that included terms not agreed upon by the parties on the
record. Wife argued that the trial court erred as a matter of law by entering the
judgment, because it was inconsistent with the agreement placed on the record by
the parties and their attorneys in court; it was not signed by wife or her attorney;
and the court was aware that, in fact, wife did not agree to all of the provisions
therein – contesting husband’s proposed property division, parenting time, and

9|Page

child support. Husband argued that the judgment “did not differ substantially
from the agreement that was put on the record. The Court of Appeals agreed with
wife and, accordingly, reversed and remanded the judgment of the trial court.
Practice tip: Get it in writing and get it signed.
b. Judgments Beyond the Stipulations.
Gram and Gram, 271 Or App 528 (2015) was issued on June 3, 2015.
Clayton Patrick argued for Appellant (husband) and Michael C. Petersen argued
for Respondent (wife). Judge Garrett delivered the opinion of the court.
This case involves a dispute over the meaning of a judgment that terminated
the parties’ marriage and divided the marital assets (the house). Several years
after the trial court entered that judgment, wife filed a motion to clarify the
judgment on the basis that the judgment was ambiguous because it did not
provide a remedy if husband did not sell the house in a timely fashion. After
conducting a hearing, the trial court entered a supplemental judgment finding
ambiguity. Husband appealed, arguing that the supplemental judgment modified
the unambiguous property division in the original judgment, which the trial court
lacked the authority to do. Husband also argued that the court erred when it (1)
refused to admit certain exhibits offered by husband and (2) made findings that
were unsupported by any facts on the record. The Court of Appeals agreed that
the supplemental judgment impermissibly modified the property division in the
original judgment. That conclusion obviated the need to address husband’s other
arguments. The supplemental judgment was reversed.
