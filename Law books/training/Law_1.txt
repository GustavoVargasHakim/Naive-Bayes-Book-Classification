PREFACE

Contents | Index

This electronic publication was conceived in the summer of 1992. A small band of Cornell
Law students, charged with identifying subjects on which computer-based materials would be
particularly helpful, placed citation at the top of the list. With their assistance I prepared the
first edition of Introduction to Basic Legal Citation. It was released on diskette that fall, one
of the first hypertext publications of Cornell's Legal Information Institute (LII). Later
reconfigured for the Web, where it still resides at: http://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/, the
work has been updated regularly in the years since. Like that online version on which it is
based, this e-book was most recently revised in the fall of 2012 to take account of changes in
the citation rules of a small number of U.S. jurisdictions and the format of currency
information furnished for statutes by LexisNexis and Westlaw. As was true of the editions
released in 2011 and 2010 it is indexed to the fourth edition of the ALWD Citation Manual
and the nineteenth edition of The Bluebook.
A Few Tips on Using Introduction to Basic Legal Citation
This is not a comprehensive citation reference work. Its limited aim is to serve as a tutorial on
how to cite the most widely referenced types of U.S. legal material, taking account of local
norms and the changes in citation practice forced by the shift from print to electronic sources.
It begins with an introductory unit. That is followed immediately by one on "how to cite" the
categories of authority that comprise a majority of the citations in briefs and legal
memoranda. Using the full table of contents one can proceed through this material in
sequence. The third unit, organized around illustrative examples, is intended to be used either
for review and reinforcement of the prior "how to" sections or as an alternative approach to
them. One can start with it since the illustrative examples for each document type are linked
back to the relevant "how to" principles.
The sections on abbreviations and omissions, on typeface (italics and underlining), and on
how citations fit into the larger project of legal writing that follow all support the preceding
units. They are accessible independently and also, where appriopriate, via links from the
earlier sections. Finally, there are a series of cross reference tables tying this introduction to
the two major legal citation reference works and to state-specific citation rules and practices.
The work is also designed to be used by those confronting a specific citation issue. For such
purposes the table of contents provides one path to the relevant material. Another, to which
the bar at the top of each major section provides ready access, is a topical index. This index is
alphabetically arrayed and more detailed than the table of contents. Finally, the search
function in your e-book reader software should allow an even narrower inquiry, such as one
seeking the abbreviation for a specific word (e.g., institute) or illustrative citations for a
particular state, Ohio, say.
If the device on which you are reading this e-book allows it, the pdf format will enable you to
print or to copy and paste portions, large or small, into other documents. However, since the

v

work is filled with linked cross references and both the table of contents and index rely on
them, most will find a print copy far less useful than the electronic original.
Help with Citation Issues Beyond the Scope of this Work
The "help" links available throughout the work lead back to this preface and its tips on how to
find specific topics within its coverage. Being an introductory work, not a comprehensive
reference, this resource has a limited scope and assumes that users confronting specialized
citation issues will have to pursue them into the pages of The Bluebook, the ALWD Citation
Manual, or a guide or manual dealing with the citation practices of their particular
jurisdiction. The cross reference tables in sections 7-300 (Bluebook) and 7-400 (ALWD),
incorporated by links throughout this work, are designed to facilitate such out references.
Wherever you see [BB|ALWD] at the end of a section heading you can obtain direct pointers to
more detailed material in The Bluebook (by clicking on BB) or ALWD Citation Manual
(ALWD).
Comments, Corrections, Extensions
Feedback on this e-book would be most welcome. What doesn't work, isn't clear, is missing,
appears to be in error? Has a change occurred in one of the fifty states that should be
reported? Comments of these and other kinds can sent by email addressed to peter.martin@
cornell.edu with the word "Citation" appearing in the subject line. Many of the features and
some of the coverage of this reference are the direct result of past user questions and advice.
As an alternative or in addition, a companion “wiki” now allows users to raise questions, pose
comments, elaborate upon the work’s introductory treatment or extend its coverage to other
types of material or jurisdictions. While I shall consult that wiki regularly and am committed
to reviewing it carefully when updating Basic Legal Citation, this is primarily not an "ask the
author" or "tell the author" forum. It aims rather to provide a framework that will allow those
teaching and learning about legal citation, as well as professionals confronting an unfamiliar
citation challenge, to discuss, extend and improve the underlying work. To access the wiki go

§ 1-000. BASIC LEGAL CITATION: WHAT AND WHY? [BB|ALWD]
§ 1-100. Introduction

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

When lawyers present legal arguments and judges write opinions, they cite authority. They
lace their representations of what the law is and how it applies to a given situation with
references to statutes, regulations, and prior appellate decisions they believe to be pertinent
and supporting. They also refer to persuasive secondary literature such as treatises,
restatements, and journal articles. As a consequence, those who would read law writing and
do law writing must master a new, technical language – "legal citation."
For many years, the authoritative reference work on "legal citation" was a manual written and
published by a small group of law reviews. Known by the color of its cover, The Bluebook
was the codification of professional norms that introduced generations of law students to
"legal citation." So completely do many academics, lawyers, and judges identify the process
with that book they may refer to putting citations in proper form as "Bluebooking" or ask a
law student or graduate whether she knows how to "Bluebook." The most recent edition of
The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation, the nineteenth, was published in 2010. In 2000
a competing reference appeared, one designed specifically for instructional use. Prepared by
the Association of Legal Writing Directors, the ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional
System of Citation (4th ed. 2010) has won wide acceptance in law schools.
Differences between the two are minor (and noted here). In the way that dictionaries both
prescribe and reflect usage, so do these manuals. Both also reflect the environment of their
creation – law schools with comprehensive print libraries and full access to the major
commercial online legal information systems. The realities of professional practice in many
settings, particularly at a time when digital distribution of legal materials is displacing print,
lead to dialects or usages in legal citation neither manual includes.
This introduction to legal citation is focused on the forms of citation used in professional
practice rather than those used in journal publication. For that reason, it does not cover The
Bluebook's distinct typography rules for the latter. Furthermore, it aims to identify the more
important points on which there is divergence between the rules set out in the two manuals
and evolving usage reflected in legal memoranda and briefs prepared by practicing lawyers.
Like other new languages, "legal citation" is easier to read than it is to write, at least at first.
The active use of any language requires greater mastery than the receiving and understanding
of it. In addition, there is the potential confusion of dialects or other nonstandard forms of
expression. As already noted, "legal citation," like other languages, does indeed have dialects.
Most are readily understandable and thus pose little likelihood of confusion for a reader. To
the beginning writer, however, they present a serious risk of misleading and inconsistent
models. As a writer of "legal citation," you must take care that you check all references that
you find in the work of others. This includes citations in court opinions. Commercial
publishers have long viewed citation as a subtle form of advertising through branding. Thus,
citations in decisions published in the multiple series of the National Reporter System of the
Thomson Reuters unit known as West (from the Atlantic Reporter to the Federal Supplement)
1

have been altered by its editors to refer to other West publications. In addition, several
important state courts, California and New York among them, have idiosyncratic citation
norms for their own decisions. Many more cite their state's statutes and administrative
regulations without repetition of a full abbreviation of the state's name in each reference, that
being implied by context. While each of these courts is likely to accept – indeed, may even
prefer – briefs using the same citation dialect, Federal courts in the same state may not. In
short, copying and pasting citations from decisions and other references into one's own
writing is almost certain to yield inconsistent, nonstandard, and even incomplete citations.
Changes in citation norms over time also caution against relying on source material for proper
citation form. The Bluebook has been revised five times since 1990, substantially in 1991,
controversially in 1996, and again in 2000, 2005, and 2010 (see § 7-200). Because of these
changes, citations you find in legal documents published in prior years, although they may
have been totally conformed to citation standards at the time of writing, may need
reformatting to comply with current ones. In other words, imported citations, even those
imported from the most carefully edited pre-2010 journal articles, books, or opinions, may not
be in proper current form. It should also be noted that The Bluebook itself has throughout
these revisions set forth two distinct versions of citation – one for journals and an alternative
set of "practitioner rules."
Few people find a dictionary the best starting point for learning a new language. For many of
the same reasons neither The Bluebook nor the ALWD Citation Manual is a good primer. Like
dictionaries, both manuals are designed as comprehensive reference works. This introduction
refers to them throughout. But while The Bluebook and the ALWD Citation Manual aim at
exhaustive coverage, these materials seek to introduce the basics through concise statements
of principles and usage linked to examples. The aim is not to separate you from a full
reference work; inevitably you will encounter unusual situations that require "looking up" the
proper "rule" or abbreviation in the pages of one manual or the other. Instead, this
introduction aims at building a basic mastery of "legal citation" as codified in those references
– a level of mastery that should enable you to do all of your legal reading and much of your
legal writing without having to reach for them. Since both The Bluebook and the ALWD
Citation Manual embrace the full range of journal writing, they furnish guidance on how to
cite all manner of references infrequently used in practitioner writing, including a variety of
foreign law materials and historic references. By contrast, this introduction is limited to
contemporary U.S. legal material.
Because this introduction is not a substitute for a comprehensive reference, you would be wise
to introduce yourself to one or the other of the principal manuals as you proceed through this
material. Read through its table of contents and introductory material. Each topic covered here
includes links to tables providing references to coverage in The Bluebook and the ALWD
Citation Manual. Observing how the manual that you have chosen (or others have chosen for
you) arrays its more detailed treatment should be part of your initial exploration of each topic
here.
There is no question but that striving for proper citation form will for a time seem a silly
distraction. But as is true with other languages, those who use this one carefully make
negative assumptions about the craft of those who don't. Being a simple language at its core,
this one should fairly quickly become a matter of habit and, thus, no longer a distraction.

§ 1-200. Purposes of Legal Citation

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

What is "legal citation"? It is a standard language that allows one writer to refer to legal
authorities with sufficient precision and generality that others can follow the
references. Because writing by lawyers and judges is so dependent on such references, it is a
language of abbreviations and special terms. While this encryption creates difficulty for lay
readers, it achieves a dramatic reduction in the space consumed by the, often numerous,
references. As you become an experienced reader of law writing, you will learn to follow a
line of argument straight through the many citations embedded in it. Even so, citations are a
bother until the reader wishes to follow one. The fundamental tradeoff that underlies any
citation scheme is one between providing full information about the referenced work and
keeping the text as uncluttered as possible. Standard abbreviations and codes help achieve a
reasonable compromise of these competing interests.
A reference properly written in "legal citation" strives to do at least three things, within
limited space:
•
•

•

identify the document and document part to which the writer is referring
provide the reader with sufficient information to find the document or document part
in the sources the reader has available (which may or may not be the same sources as
those used by the writer), and
furnish important additional information about the referenced material and its
connection to the writer's argument to assist readers in deciding whether or not to
pursue the reference.

Consider the following illustration of the problem faced and the tradeoff struck by "legal
citation." In 1989, the Supreme Court decided an important copyright case. There are
countless sources of the full text opinion. One is LexisNexis, where the following appears
prior to the opinion. If a lawyer, wanting to refer to all or part of that opinion, were to include
all the identifying material shown in LexisNexis in her brief (with a similar amount of
identifying material for other authorities) there would be little room for anything else. Readers
of such a brief would have an impossible time following lines of argument past the massive
interruptions of citation.

COMMUNITY FOR CREATIVE NON-VIOLENCE ET AL. v. REID
No. 88-293
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
490 U.S. 730; 109 S. Ct. 2166; 104 L. Ed. 2d 811; 1989 U.S. LEXIS 2727; 57 U.S.L.W.
4607; 10 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1985; Copy. L. Rep. (CCH) P26,425; 16 Media L. Rep. 1769
March 29, 1989, Argued
June 5, 1989, Decided
PRIOR HISTORY: CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT.
DISPOSITION: 270 U. S. App. D. C. 26, 846 F. 2d 1485, affirmed.

In standard "legal citation," the reference to this opinion becomes simply:
Cmty. for Creative Nonviolence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730 (1989).
With economy this identifies the document and allows another lawyer to retrieve the decision
from a wide range of print and electronic sources. The "identifier" of "490 U.S. 730" suffices
for a reader who has access to West's Supreme Court Reporter published by Thomson Reuters
or to the Lawyers' Edition, Second Series published in print and online by LexisNexis or to
Westlaw or to the myriad other online and disc-based sources of Supreme Court decisions. It
also tells the reader that this is a 1989 decision of the United States Supreme Court (and not,
say, a fifty year old opinion of a U.S. District Court).
The task of "legal citation" in short is to provide sufficient information to the reader of a brief
or memorandum to aid a decision about which authorities to check as well as in what order to
consult them and to permit efficient and precise retrieval – all of that, without consuming any
more space or creating any more distraction than is absolutely necessary.
§ 1-300. Types of Citation Principles

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

The detailed principles of citation can be conceived of as falling into four categories:
Full Address Principles: Principles that specify completeness of the address or
identification of a cited document or document portion in terms that will allow the reader to
retrieve it.

4

Other Minimum Content Principles: Principles that call for the inclusion in a citation of
additional information items beyond a retrieval address – the full name of the author of a
journal article, the year a decision was rendered or a statutory codification last
updated. Some of these principles are conditional, that is, they require the inclusion of a
particular item under specified circumstances so that the absence of that item from a
citation represents that those circumstances do not exist. The subsequent history of a case
must be indicated when it exists, for example; the edition of a book must be indicated when
there have been more than one. Most of these additional items either furnish a "name" for
the cited document or information that will allow the reader to evaluate its importance.
Compacting Principles: Principles that reduce the space taken up by the information items
included in a citation. These include standard abbreviations ("United States Code" becomes
"U.S.C.") and principles that eliminate redundancy. (If the deciding court is communicated
by the name of the reporter, it need not be repeated in the citation's concluding parentheses
along with the date as it should otherwise be.)
Format Principles: Principles about punctuation, typography, order of items within a
citation, and the like. Such principles apply to the optional elements in a citation as well as
the mandatory ones. One need not report to the reader that a cited Supreme Court case was
decided 5-4; but if one does, there is a standard form.
§ 1-400. Levels of Mastery

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

What degree of mastery of this language should one strive for – as a student, legal assistant, or
lawyer?
Recall that a citation serves several purposes. Of those purposes, one is paramount –
furnishing accurate and complete information that will enable retrieval of the cited document
or document part. The element of citation that calls for immediate mastery is painstaking care
in recording and presenting the complete address or retrieval ID of a document. Citing a case
using the wrong volume or page number, citing a statute with an erroneous section number or
without a necessary title number – errors like these cannot be explained away by the
intricacies of citation. Their negative impact on readers is palpable. Consider the frustration
you experience when you are given an erroneous or partial street address or an email address
that bounces because of a typo; a judge's reaction to an erroneous citation is likely to be quite
similar.
Since, in many cases, part of the clear address to a cited document includes an abbreviation, a
small set of abbreviations must be mastered as soon as possible. A minimum set includes
those that represent the reporters for contemporary federal decisions, those that represent
codified federal statutes and regulations, and those that represent the regional reporters of
state decisions. Whenever your research is centered in the law of a particular state, you will
want also to memorize the abbreviations that represent the reporters, statutory compilations,
and regulations of that state.
Less critical in terms of function but no more difficult to master are the abbreviations that
indicate the deciding court when that information is not implicit in the name of the
reporter. You should strive to master the abbreviations for the circuits of the U.S. Courts of
5

Appeals and those for the U.S. District Courts. Any time your research is centered in the law
of a particular state you will want to master the abbreviations for its courts.
Last and least are the conventions for reducing the space consumed by case names. Including
the full word "Environmental" in a case name rather than the abbreviation "Envtl." is,
standing by itself, a trivial oversight. A consistent failure to abbreviate on the one hand or the
use of idiosyncratic or inconsistent abbreviations on the other can produce inconvenience for
the reader. Since your aim in nearly all law writing will be to persuade your reader, to win
your reader over, you do not want to irritate or to convey an impression of
carelessness. Therefore, a final review of one's citations against the standard abbreviations
and omissions set forth in one or the other of the dominant manuals is an important step. In
time, you will find that you have internalized most of those rules.
Writing legal citation follows thorough legal research. As you carry out your research, your
notes should capture all the information you will need to write the necessary citations. That
entails recording all the required items for a full citation. It doesn't mean that you should take
the time in the midst of research to check proper abbreviations; that can be a later step. What
you will want to achieve, as soon as possible, is knowledge of what information elements will
be required in a full citation. Knowing what to note at the time you do your research will save
you from having to pay return visits to sources simply to determine which circuit decided a
particular case, what paragraph or page numbers are associated with the portion of a decision
supporting your point, or how recently the statutory compilation on which you are relying was
updated.
Learning to read legal citation should be your first goal. Since you are surrounded by citations
in any cases or articles you read, that should be easy. Even this requires an active frame of
mind, however; it is easy to skim past citations. As you read legal material exercise your
growing command of legal citation by asking yourself occasionally about a cited source:
What is it? How would I retrieve it? And when you are reading in an environment that permits
ready access to cases, statutes or other cited material and you are curious about a point on
which there are cited references (or your head simply needs a change of pace) follow a
citation or two. Reading and following citations should not require use of a manual.
Ultimately you will be able to write most citations without use of this reference or a manual –
most but not all. The old and the unusual will drive even the most experienced legal writer
back to the pages of The Bluebook or the ALWD Citation Manual and, in states where one
exists, a local citation guide.
§ 1-500. Citation in Transition: From Proprietary Print Citations to Vendor- and
Medium-Neutral Schemes Contents | Index | Help | < | >
Neither of the major citation manuals gives much hint of the intense policy debate over
citation norms catalyzed by the shift from print to digital media. Over the past two decades
online and disc-based law collections have become primary research tools for many, if not
most, lawyers and judges. Simultaneously, the number of alternate sources of individual
decisions, regulations, and statutes has exploded. Today, in many jurisdictions, legal research
is carried out by means of at least a half dozen competing versions of appellate decisions
distributed in print, via the Internet, and on disc. Because of these changes, there has been
6

growing pressure on those ultimately responsible for citation norms, namely the courts, to
establish new rules that no longer presuppose that some one publisher's print volume (created
over a year after the decisions or statutes it compiles were handed down or enacted) is the key
reference. Several jurisdictions have responded; many more are sure to follow. On the other
hand, work habits and established practices die hard, especially when they align with vested
commercial interests.
In 1996, the American Bar Association approved a resolution recommending that courts adopt
a uniform public domain citation system "equally effective for printed case reports and for
case reports electronically published on computer disks or network services." It proceeded to
lay out the essential components of such a system. The American Association of Law
Libraries had previously gone on record for "vendor and media neutral" citation. An
increasing number of state courts have adopted citation schemes embodying the core elements
recommended by these national bodies. For example, North Dakota state court opinions
released after January 1, 1997 are to be cited according to the following North Dakota
Supreme Court rule:
When available, initial citations must include the volume and initial page number of the
North Western Reporter in which the opinion is published. The initial citation of any
published opinion of the Supreme Court released on or after January 1, 1997, contained in a
brief, memorandum, or other document filed with any trial or appellate court and the
citation in the table of cases in a brief must also include a reference to the calendar year in
which the decision was filed, followed by the court designation of "ND", followed by a
sequential number assigned by the Clerk of the Supreme Court. A paragraph citation should
be placed immediately following the sequential number assigned to the case. Subsequent
citations within the brief, memorandum or other document must include the paragraph
number and sufficient references to identify the initial citation.
N.D. R. Ct. 11.6 (b).
The Rule provides examples, e.g.:

Smith v. Jones, 1996 ND 15, ¶ 21, 600 N.W.2d 900 (fictional).

For decisions of the North Dakota Court of Appeals, the formula is the same with the
substitution of "ND App" for "ND." As intended, the system facilitates precise and immediate
reference to a portion of a North Dakota appellate decision that is as effective whether the
reader follows the citation using the court's own Web site or one of the commercial online
services or finds it in a volume of the North Western Reporter. Since the key citation
elements, including paragraph numbers, are embedded in each decision by the court, they are
carried over into that print reporter and the commercial electronic services. As a
complementary measure, the North Dakota Supreme Court Web site furnishes the North
Western Reporter citations for all decisions in its database, which currently reaches back
through 1966. Consequently, researchers need not consult a commercial source to obtain the
volume and page numbers associated with over four decades of decisions.

7

While the formats and other details vary slightly, several other jurisdictions have implemented
case citation schemes employing the same basic structure – case name, year, court, sequential
number, and (within the opinion) paragraph number or numbers. In addition to North Dakota
these include Colorado, Maine, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah,
Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. In 2009 Arkansas began to designate its appellate
decisions in this way, while retaining page numbers within the court-released pdf file as the
means for pinpoint cites. Four other states, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, and, most recently,
Illinois, have adopted medium-neutral citation systems, but along significantly different lines.
At the federal level, the progress has, to date, been minimal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit began to apply medium-neutral citations to its own decisions in 1994, but it
has never directed attorneys to use them or employed them itself in referring to prior decisions
once they have appeared in the Federal Reporter series. Among district courts, the District of
South Dakota appears to stand alone. Since 1996, some, although not all, of its judges have
applied paragraph numbers and case designations in the format "2008 DSD 6" to their
decisions and used the system in citations to them. (See § 2-230.)
Given their quite different structure codified statutes and regulations lend themselves to
vendor- and medium-neutral citation. Evolving professional practice, influenced by the
prevalence of electronic media, is reducing the hold that certain preferred print editions once
held on statute and regulation citations. (See §§ 2-335, 2-410.)
§ 1-600. Who Sets Citation Norms

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

There is no national citation standard-setting authority, and despite the tendency of citation
manuals to attach the word "rule" to specific citation practices, their authoritative reach is, at
best, limited to a specific sector – those writing for particular journals, editing material for one
or another commercial publisher, submitting briefs to a particular court. For most law writing,
the relevant citations norms are set by widely accepted professional usage.
The citation manual created by the editors of four law journals, the Columbia Law Review, the
Harvard Law Review, the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, and The Yale Law Journal,
invariably referred to as The Bluebook, was for decades the most widely used codification of
national citation norms. Now in its nineteenth edition, The Bluebook governs the citation
practices of the majority of U.S. student-edited law journals and has, through its successive
editions, shaped the citation education and resulting citation habits of most U.S. lawyers.
The new ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional System of Citation (4th ed. 2010) has
quickly gained a wide following in U.S. law schools, and since it aims to reflect current
usage, it is highly consistent with The Bluebook.
An earlier competing academic project, The University of Chicago Manual of Legal Citation,
which called itself the "Maroon Book," offered a distinctly different and less rigid set of rules.
First published in 1989, it failed to win a significant following or affect professional practice
except insofar as it recognized the importance of leaving "a fair amount of discretion to
practitioners, authors, and editors." Id. at 9.
In some states, the norms set out in national manuals are supplemented or overridden by court
rules about the content, composition, and format of legal memoranda and briefs. Most often
8

such rules are largely consistent with national norms but set out special and typically more
detailed rules for the citation of cases, statutes, and regulations of the state in question. Some
of these state-specific rules call for inclusion of an additional citation element, such as a
medium-neutral or other official case citation. Others require less, as, for example, not calling
for repetition of the state name or its abbreviation in all state statutory citations, that being
implied. Only a handful of these court rules set out a markedly different citation format.
While court-mandated citation rules of this sort formally apply only to documents filed with
the specified courts, they are likely to influence professional citation practice within the state
more generally.
Courts not only shape local citation norms by local rules governing brief format, their policies
for publication and dissemination affect the means of citation. Only a court can effectively
establish the means for vendor- and medium-neutral citation of its decisions. Courts that leave
the association of an enduring, citable identification for each decision and its parts to a
commercial publisher, by default, force the use of the dominant publisher's print citation
scheme.
Some courts, including both the Supreme Court and court systems in a number of states,
retain full editorial responsibility for citable, final and official versions of their opinions.
Generally implemented through a public court reporter's office, this function invariably gives
rise to detailed citation norms, as well as other rules of style, that apply to decisions
distributed by the court. Where the court's citation format is significantly different from
national norms, as it is, for example, in New York, that may or may not influence lawyer
citation practice. Courts seriously implementing medium-neutral citation not only attach the
necessary decision ID and paragraph numbering to each decision, but use it in citing prior
cases.
The large commercial publishers also have their own distinct citation practices, in part
designed to reinforce brand. A judge's citation to "Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55
(1979)" when reported in West's National Reporter System becomes "Butner v. United States,
440 U.S. 48, 55, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136 (1979)." Annotations in a West annotated code
systematically place that company's National Reporter System citation for a case ahead of its
volume and page number in an official state reporter. Annotations and summaries in the
LexisNexis Lawyers' Edition of Supreme Court decisions cite to the same publisher's United
States Code Service – e.g., "15 USCS § 637(d)."
As noted in the discussion of medium-neutral citation, two important national bodies, the
American Bar Association (ABA) and American Association of Law Libraries (AALL), have
sought to persuade courts, publishers, and lawyers to implement citation standards that are not
keyed to print or to any specific publisher's offerings. The AALL has gone further and
published a Universal Citation Guide. This guide sets out a blueprint for courts designing
medium-neutral citation schemes for their own decisions, as well as complementary
approaches to other types of legal authority that can be implemented simply through
professional acceptance. See AALL, Universal Citation Guide (ver. 2.1 2002).
In the end, most of "legal citation," like most of any language, is established by evolving
usage, reinforced in some cases, altered in others, by the members of distinct communities.

§ 2-000. HOW TO CITE ...

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

§ 2-100. How to Cite Electronic Sources
While the principal citation reference works still treat the citation of electronically accessed
sources as though they were exceptional cases, increasingly online sources, disc and e-book
publications constitute not only print alternatives, but preferred distribution channels. This is
true for judicial opinions, statutes, regulations, journal articles, and government reports of
many kinds. Not only are many legal materials now available in paired print and electronic
editions put out by a single publisher, but sources have proliferated. Today, it is far less likely
than it was only a few years ago that the person writing a legal document and that document's
readers will be working from exactly the same sources in the same format.
This shift makes it important that, wherever possible, a citation furnish sufficient information
about the cited material to enable a reader to pursue the reference without regard to format or
immediate source. With the most frequently cited materials – cases, constitutions, statutes,
regulations, and recent journal articles – this is typically not a challenge since most legal
information distributors, whether commercial, public, or nonprofit, endeavor to furnish all the
data necessary for source- and medium-independent citation.
So long as you are able to furnish all the citation information called for by § 2-200, there is no
need to indicate whether you relied on any one of numerous online sources, an e-book or a
disc instead of one of the several print editions for the text of a U.S. Supreme Court decision.
Similarly, your citations to provisions of the U.S. Code or a comparable compilation of state
statutes need not indicate whether you accessed them in print or from an electronic source,
nor need you indicate that you accessed an article in a widely distributed law journal on
LexisNexis, Westlaw or some other Internet site.
Citations making specific reference to an electronic source are necessary only when the cited
material is not widely available from multiple sources and when identifying the electronic
source is likely significantly to aid readers' access to it.
The relevant citation principles follow; section 3-100 provides basic examples.

Principle 1: Cite to material as it is denominated and organized in "print" unless much better
access is available electronically. Even where an electronic source is used, if the material is
reasonably available in print cite in relation to the print version, but follow that reference with
a parallel citation to the electronic source if it is likely to aid retrieval. "Reasonably available"
and "likely to aid retrieval" should, of course, be considered from the standpoint of those
likely to read the work in which the citation will appear. The following signals can be used to
indicate whether:
•
•

the electronic source is the only known source or the print source is, as a practical
matter, unavailable (no explanatory word or phrase)
the electronic source is a parallel reference to a print source ("available at").

Principle 2: The citation should consist of all the elements required for the basic document
type (e.g., case, constitution, statute, regulation), followed by the appropriate signal, and as
complete an ID or address for the online electronic source as is available.
Examples of appropriate address information include:
•
•

the full URL of a Web-based document
a Westlaw or LexisNexis citation.

¡But see § 2-115(2)!
Where no unique address is available indicate the source and database identification
information in a parenthetical, e.g.

•
•

(LexisNexis Veterans Benefits Manual and Related Laws and Regulations CD-ROM).

Similarly, if a complete URL is either unavailable or unwieldy, provide a base URL and
provide the steps that will retrieve the document in parenthesis, e.g.
•

(follow "Data & Research" link; then follow "Policy Research Reports" link).

Principle 3: A date should be furnished for an electronic source when the document citation
does not itself carry that information unambiguously. That date should be the stated "current
through" date or release date for a disc publication, the "through" date for online sources if
available or a "last modified" or "last updated" date if one is furnished for the cited material
or, failing all else, a "last visited" or "accessed" date. Where such a date is required, it should
be placed at the end of the citation in a parenthetical. If there is already a parenthetical
including source and database information (see above), the two should be combined,
separated by a comma.

Point 1: The ALWD Citation Manual treats these situations somewhat differently than the
principle set out in § 2-110(1). It provides specifically for electronic journals, placing the
URL, without signal, at the end of the citation, and for cases, where it places the URL or
commercial database cite directly following the parties' names (see § 2-225). As to other
material, whether available from both print and electronic sources or only electronic ones, it
places the electronic address (URL, Westlaw or LexisNexis cite, database identifier) in a
parenthetical preceded by "available in" or "available at".
Point 2: The first edition of the ALWD Citation Manual placed URLs in angle brackets; but
now, like The Bluebook, it leaves them off.
Point 3: The ALWD Citation Manual favors the use of "last updated" over "last modified"
and "accessed" over "last visited".

Scholarly articles frequently appear online prior to their appearance in print, if, indeed, that
ever occurs. Often, they are issued in an institution's working paper series. Where that is the
case, the working paper designation and number should be included in the citation in the
parenthesis containing the date.

§ 2-200. How to Cite Judicial Opinions

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

In the U.S. legal system, judicial opinions are probably the most frequently cited category of
legal material. The articulated grounds of past judicial decisions are, in many instances,
binding precedent for currently litigated matters. Under other circumstances, they are
"persuasive" authority. In either event, if on point, they should be cited. In the context of legal
citation, judicial opinions are commonly referred to as "cases" and organized collections of
opinions are called "law reports" or "case reports." Most cited "cases" are opinions of
appellate courts; however, trial court rulings on questions of law do on occasion produce
decisions lawyers may wish to cite, despite their limited force as precedent.
Prior to the era of electronic information dissemination, many courts that produced large
numbers of legal opinions selected only a fraction of them for "publication" in law reports.
The remaining "unpublished cases" were, as a practical matter, unavailable for citation. The
appearance of online systems ready, even eager, to pick up and distribute "unpublished"
decisions forced courts to be clearer about the status of decisions they view as merely
involving the routine application of settled law. See § 2-250.
Since the decisions of American courts generally deal with multiple issues and tend to be
lengthy, recounting pre-litigation facts and procedural events of limited relevance to the
points for which they might be cited, it is rarely enough simply to cite the case. Under most
circumstances, a full case citation should include a reference to a specific portion or portions
of the opinion. A reference that merely directs the reader to a decision of the U.S. Supreme
Court and no more has a greater likelihood of frustrating than persuading. It is analogous to
route directions that identify the city or neighborhood but fail to furnish a complete street
address.
The relevant citation principles follow; section 3-200 provides both basic examples and
sample case citations from all major U.S. jurisdictions.
§ 2-210. Case Citations – Most Common Form [BB|ALWD]
§ 2-210(a) Examples
– Czapinski v. St. Francis Hosp., Inc., 2000 WI 80, 236 Wis. 2d 316, 613 N.W.2d
120.
– Kootenai Envtl. Alliance, Inc. v. Panhandle Yacht Club, Inc., 671 P.2d 1085 (Idaho
1983).

Principle: The core of a case citation consists of four elements:
Element (a) - The parties' names (often referred to as the "case name" or less frequently the
"style" or "caption" of the case)
•
•

Names are italicized or underlined (§ 5-100)
and boiled down using an extensive set of omissions (§ 4-300) and abbreviations (§
4-100),
14

o
o

with a lower case "v." replacing "versus",
and ending with a comma separating this component from the next.
§ 2-210(b) Examples

– Czapinski v. St. Francis Hosp., Inc., 2000 WI 80, 236 Wis. 2d 316, 613 N.W.2d
120.

N.W.2d 120.
– Kootenai Envtl. Alliance, Inc. v. Panhandle Yacht Club, Inc., 671 P.2d 1085 (Idaho
1983).
– Kootenai Envtl. Alliance, Inc. v. Panhandle Yacht Club, Inc., 671 P.2d 1085,
1092 (Idaho 1983).

Element (b) - At least one ID or address for the case (often itself referred to as the "cite or
"citation") consisting of
•
•

a medium-neutral citation, if provided by the court, (§ 2-230)
failing that, one constructed of:
o the reporter volume number
o reporter name (abbreviated) (§ 4-400)
o the first page of the case in that volume.

If the reference is to a portion of the opinion (as in most instances it should be), the
paragraph number or numbers of that portion (with a medium-neutral citation) or the page
number or numbers of that part should follow the case ID or address, set off by a comma.
(Citations to one or more specific point or points in an opinion are commonly referred to as
"pinpoint" or "jump" citations.)
In some situations only one ID or reporter citation is required. In others, two or more
should be provided in "parallel" – i.e., in succession – separated by commas.
•

•

Most courts that have implemented medium-neutral citation formats call for
continued use of print-based case IDs in parallel, when available, although not
parallel "pinpoint" pages since the paragraph numbers serve that purpose equally in
print.
When state cases are cited to a court in the same state, parallel addresses should be
provided if the case is reported in both an official state reporter and a West regional
reporter – the official reporter address coming first, the regional reporter address
second, the two separated by a comma. Under other circumstances, state decisions
that appear in a regional reporter are cited only to that reporter. This can mean that
the same decision will have a different citation form when cited within its state than
when cited in other states.

Element (c) The date

The year of decision is enclosed in parentheses if it has not already appeared in the
case ID.

– IBM v. Universal Transcon. Corp., 191 A.D.2d 536, 595 N.Y.S.2d 106 (2d Dept.
1993).

Element (d) The court
•
•

•

•

In any reference where the court is sufficiently identified by the case ID or reporter
– as for example "WI" or "Wis." – no additional reference is necessary.
The regional reporters covering numerous states and the reporters containing
decisions of the lower federal courts do not sufficiently identify the court for a
particular case. Consequently, that information must be added. Court identification
is placed, in abbreviated form, in the parentheses containing the year of decision.
The highest appellate court in a state is indicated by the abbreviation for the state
standing alone. Furthermore, no notation at all is required when the state is
indicated in a reporter name. For example, "(Kan. 1976)" indicates a 1976 decision
of the Kansas Supreme Court while a decision of the Kansas Court of Appeals
would be indicated by "(Kan. Ct. App. 1984)" and a decision of the Kansas
Supreme Court cited to the official reporter would simply show the date. ¡But see §
2-215(2)!
Whether to indicate which of several circuits, districts, divisions or departments of a
court rendered a decision depends both on the court and the context for the citation.
Which circuit of the U.S. Courts of Appeals or which U.S. District Court handed
down a decision is always indicated. With a decision from an intermediate level
state court, the information should be included in any setting where it bears on the
citation's authority or is otherwise important. Thus, in a state where the decisions of
one department or circuit are not binding on another one, citations should identify
16

the unit that decided a case. When citing the same decision in another state there
would be no need to do so.
§ 2-215. Case Citations – Points of Difference in Citation Practice
Point 1: Whether to use parallel case citations and, if not, which citation to use is a subject on
which court rules often speak. The practice set out here is consistent with most of them,
although a few state rules call for citations of decisions from other jurisdictions to include
both an official reporter reference, if any, and a West regional reporter reference. See § 7-500.
Point 2: The ALWD Citation Manual rejects the dominant practice of including "Ct." when
abbreviating the many intermediate state appellate courts. Its abbreviation for the Kansas
Court of Appeals is, therefore, "Kan. App." rather than "Kan. Ct. App."
§ 2-220. Case Citations – Variants and Special Cases [BB|ALWD]
Most case citations refer to opinions that have already appeared in established print reporters
and their conformed electronic counterparts. Opinions for which that is not true either because
they are very recent or because the court or publisher of the relevant reporter did not consider
the decision important enough for such dissemination call for alternative identification. The
challenge in such a situation is to furnish the reader sufficient information to retrieve the
document from one or more specialized sources. (This is one of the problems addressed by
medium-neutral citation systems. See § 2-230.) The following alternatives can be used. While
they are listed in order of traditional preference, the ultimate choice should be made in terms
of the intended readers' likely access. (Before citing a decision that is not "published" because
of the court's own judgment about its limited precedential importance, be sure to consult the
court's rules. See § 2-250.)

Point 1: The ALWD Citation Manual suggests omission of the docket number from citations
to cases that are in LEXIS or Westlaw. While that saves a modest amount of space, inclusion
of the docket number facilitates access to the decision by those with access through another
electronic source, whether it be a competing commercial online system or the court's own
Web site.

Point 2: When the decision is certain to appear in an established reporter but has not yet been
published, the ALWD Citation Manual calls for inclusion of a skeletal print citation with three
underlined spaces taking the place of the missing volume and page numbers.
§ 2-230. Medium-Neutral Case Citations [BB|ALWD]
In 1996, the American Bar Association approved a resolution recommending that courts adopt
a uniform public domain citation system "equally effective for printed case reports and for
case reports electronically published on computer disks or network services" and laying out
the essential components of such a medium-neutral system (see § 1-500). The American
Association of Law Libraries had previously gone on record for "vendor and media neutral"
citation and has since issued a Universal Citation Guide that details an approach consistent
with that urged by the ABA. An increasing number of jurisdictions have adopted citation
schemes embodying some or all of the elements recommended by these national bodies.
North Dakota is representative. Its court rules state in relevant part:
When available, initial citations must include the volume and initial page number of the
North Western Reporter in which the opinion is published. The initial citation of any
published opinion of the Supreme Court released on or after January 1, 1997, contained in a
brief, memorandum, or other document filed with any trial or appellate court and the
citation in the table of cases in a brief must also include a reference to the calendar year in
which the decision was filed, followed by the court designation of "ND", followed by a
19

sequential number assigned by the Clerk of the Supreme Court. A paragraph citation should
be placed immediately following the sequential number assigned to the case. Subsequent
citations within the brief, memorandum or other document must include the paragraph
number and sufficient references to identify the initial citation.
N.D. R. Ct. Rule 11.6 (b).
The Rule supplies examples, e.g.:
•
•

Smith v. Jones, 1997 ND 15, 600 N.W.2d 900 (fictional).
Smith v. Jones, 1996 ND 15, ¶ 21, 600 N.W.2d 900 (fictional).

For decisions of the North Dakota Court of Appeals, the formula is the same with the
substitution of "ND App" for "ND." In jurisdictions adopting such a vendor- and mediumneutral citation scheme, that scheme should be used, together with one or more parallel
reporter citations as may, indeed, be required by court rule or local practice.
While the formats and other details vary slightly, several other jurisdictions have implemented
case citation schemes employing the same basic structure – case name, year, court, sequential
number, and (within the opinion) paragraph number or numbers. In addition to North Dakota
these include Colorado, Maine, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah,
Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. In 2009 Arkansas began to designate its appellate
decisions in this way, while retaining page numbers within the court-released pdf file as the
means for pinpoint cites. Four other states, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, and, most recently,
Illinois, have adopted medium-neutral citation systems, but along the significantly different
lines noted below. At the federal level, the progress has, to date, been minimal. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit began to apply medium-neutral citations to its own
decisions in 1994, but it has never directed attorneys to use them or employed them itself in
referring to prior decisions once they have appeared in the Federal Reporter series. Among
district courts, the District of South Dakota appears to stand alone. Since 1996 some, although
not all, of its judges have applied paragraph numbers and case designations in the format
"2008 DSD 6" to their decisions and used the system in citations to them.
Ohio's case numbering approach operates across the entire state court system rather than court
by court, with the result that successive decisions of the state supreme court may be numbered
3957 and 3995. (These system-wide numbers are assigned by the state's reporter of decisions.)
Illinois, Louisiana, and Mississippi use the docket number as the case ID rather than
generating a new one based on year and decision sequence. In addition, Louisiana uses slip
opinion page numbers rather than paragraph numbers for pinpoint citation. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit does the same.
§ 2-240. Case Citations – Conditional Items [BB|ALWD]
The core of a case citation includes at least two items that communicate by their absence. In
other words, a case citation is read with the expectation that if certain things have occurred
they will be reported as additional elements of a reference. Citations that are silent on these
subjects are taken as representing that these facts are absent.
20

A citation consisting only of the core items represents that a clear holding of a majority of the
court stands for the proposition with which the writer has associated it. It also represents that
there have been no legal proceedings in the case occurring after the cited opinion that affect
its authority. Finally, with a court that releases both "published" and "unpublished" or "nonprecedential" decisions, in the absence of any indication otherwise, the citation of a decision
represents that it has been designated for publication.
§ 2-240(1) Examples
– City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 31, 50 (2000) (Rehnquist, C.J.,
dissenting).
– Edmond v. Goldsmith, 183 F.3d 659 (7th Cir. 1999), aff'd, 531 U.S. 31 (2000).

Principle 1: If the citation is to a dissenting, concurring, or plurality opinion or to dictum,
that fact should be reported in separate parentheses following the date
§ 2-240(2) Examples
– City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 31, 50 (2000) (Rehnquist, C.J.,
dissenting).
– Edmond v. Goldsmith, 183 F.3d 659 (7th Cir. 1999), aff'd, 531 U.S. 31 (2000).

Principle 2: If there have been one or more subsequent actions in the case cited, citations
to those actions should be reported following the core items, preceded by an abbreviation
indicating the nature of the action (§ 4-200). However, denials of certiorari by the U.S.
Supreme Court or of similar discretionary appeals by other courts need not be reported
unless they are recent (within the past two years) or otherwise noteworthy.
§ 2-240(3) Example
– Davis v. Barnhart, No. 05-10980, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 22201 (11th Cir. Oct. 12,
2005) (unpublished).

Principle 3: If the deciding court releases both "published" and "unpublished" or
"nonprecedential" decisions and the latter carry less weight, decisions of that category
should have the characterization given them by the court placed in parentheses following
the date. That is unnecessary with US Court of Appeals decisions cited to West's Federal
Appendix reporter since it contains only "unpublished" decisions. Before citing an
unpublished decision, however, see § 2-250.

21

§ 2-250. Citing Unpublished Cases [ALWD]
Electronic distribution of judicial opinions has given wide access to decisions that the issuing
courts did not view as important or precedential. A court's withholding of such decisions from
print publication once effectively limited dissemination, but no longer. While § 2-220 outlines
the format to use in citing "unpublished" cases, court rules may well instruct that decisions the
court has affirmatively designated not to be published should not be cited at all (or at least not
unless they bear directly on a subsequent matter as, for example, through res judicata). This
may be true even if a decision has in fact been published in print. Since 2001, this has been
the case with many U.S. Court of Appeals "unpublished" decisions because of West's new
Federal Appendix reporter. Before you cite a decision that the deciding court has labeled
"unpublished" or "non-precedential," you should consult that court's rules on this point.
§ 2-300. How to Cite Constitutions, Statutes, and Similar Materials

Contents | Index | Help

|<|>

In the United States, constitutions and statutes are structured in a way that allows citation of
relevant provisions without regard to how any particular version or edition has been printed.
In this fundamental sense, they are and long have been vendor- and medium-neutral. That is
because articles, sections, clauses, and subsections rather than volumes and page numbers
identify specific passages. This holds for such similar legal materials as local ordinances, on
the one hand, and international agreements, on the other. While these several types of legal
materials share this structural quality, constitutions and statutes differ dramatically from one
another in a key respect – frequency of change. The compiled enactments of Congress and the
legislatures of the states are constantly subject to amendment. This reality raises a risk, albeit
not a large one in most situations, that the text of the statute to which a writer refers and the
text consulted by a reader following the writer's citation, at some later date, may be different.
The risk is a consequence of the possibility of intervening legislative change per se and also
by the amount of time it took the respective publishers or disseminators to enter the change in
their statutory compilations. Addressing this possibility calls for both writer and reader to pay
serious attention to the date of the compilation relied on by the writer. That information must
be delivered in some non-ambiguous fashion by a statutory citation, while references to
provisions of the U.S. Constitution or a decision of the Supreme Court have, in the typical
case, no reason to indicate the currency of the edition, collection, or compilation relied upon
by the writer.
The relevant citation principles follow; section 3-300 provides both basic examples and
samples from all major U.S. jurisdictions.

§ 2-310. Constitution Citations [BB|ALWD]
§ 2-310(a) Examples
– U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 2.
– U.S. Const. amend. XIII, § 2.
– N.Y. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2.

Principle: A citation to a provision of either the federal or a state constitution consists of two
elements:
Element (a) - The name of the constitution
(The name consists of the abbreviation of the jurisdiction – e.g., U.S. for United States,
N.Y. for New York (§ 4-500) – and "Const.")
§ 2-310(b) Examples
– U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 2.
– U.S. Const. amend. XIII, § 2.
– N.Y. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2.

Element (b) - The cited part
(Parts often include articles (abbreviated "art."), amendments (abbreviated "amend.") and
clauses (abbreviated "cl."), in addition to sections (§).)
No punctuation separates the name of the constitution from the first part identifier; commas
separate successive subparts. Nothing is italicized or underlined.
§ 2-310(c) Examples
– U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 2.
– U.S. Const. amend. XVIII, § 2 (repealed 1933).
– N.Y. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2.

Element (c) - The date
No date is required unless the citation is to a provision or version of the constitution no
longer in effect.
§ 2-320. Statute Citations – Most Common Form [BB|ALWD]
Statutory provisions are, whenever possible, cited to compilations. For any single U.S.
jurisdiction, there is usually a single compilation scheme, ordering sections into topically
clustered units, even though there may be multiple versions of the code or compilation, print
and electronic, public and commercial. Until the recent proliferation of electronic sources,
citation norms favored citation to one particular print compilation for each jurisdiction. Most
citation manuals still appear to do so, but practice is rapidly adjusting to the reality that
23

electronic compilations are in general more up-to-date and therefore more widely used than
print ones, that in most jurisdictions no single version is universally relied upon, and that upto-date print compilations from other jurisdictions are maintained in very few law libraries.
§ 2-320-1(a) Example
– 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(C) (2006 & Supp. 2010).

Principle 1: The core of a citation to a codified federal statutory provision consists of three
elements:
Element (a) -The title number followed by a space and "U.S.C." (for "United States Code")
§ 2-320-1(b) Example
– 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(C) (2006 & Supp. 2010).

Element (b) - The section number preceded by the section symbol and space

U.S.C.A. § 405(c)(2)(C) (Westlaw 2012 effective Dec. 18, 2010).

Element (c) - An indication of the currency of the compilation relied upon, in parentheses.
(With print compilations, this has traditionally been simply the year the volume or base
volume and updating supplement relied upon were published. With electronic compilations,
updated at least annually, this can be the year of the compilation relied upon. If the cited
statutory provisions have been or may be volatile, an even more precise current "through"
date is desirable whether print or electronic media are used. The precise form this takes will
be governed by the form in which the compilation relied upon presents currency
information. For example, Westlaw furnishes the effective date of the most recent
amendment to the cited provision included in its compiled version rather than a “through”
date.)
No punctuation separates these elements. Nothing is italicized or underlined.

– Iowa Code § 602.1614 (2012).

§ 2-330. Statute Citations – Conditional items
§ 2-330(1) Examples
Official:
– 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(C) (2006 & Supp. 2010).
– Iowa Code § 602.1614 (2012).
Unofficial:
– 42 U.S.C.A. § 405(c)(2)(C) (West 2011) or 42 U.S.C.A. § 405(c)(2)(C) (Westlaw
2012).
– 42 U.S.C.S. § 405(c)(2)(C) (LexisNexis 1998 & Supp. 2011) or 42 U.S.C.S. §
405(c)(2)(C) (LexisNexis 2012).
– Iowa Code Ann. § 602.1614 (West 1996 & Supp. 2012) or Iowa Code Ann. §
602.1614 (Westlaw 2012).

Principle 1: If possible, the reference should be to the jurisdiction's designated "official"
codification – such as the United States Code or Iowa Code. If an unofficial commercial
codification is relied upon, it is customary to use that product's branded abbreviation if
different from the official code (U.S.C.A. or U.S.C.S. rather than U.S.C.; Iowa Code Ann.
rather than Iowa Code) and to place the publisher's name, brand, or online source
(abbreviated) ahead of the currency information in the parentheses.

¡But see § 2-335!
§ 2-330(2) Examples
Statute not amended since last print codification:
– 42 U.S.C.S. § 405(a) (LexisNexis 1998).
Statute amended since last print codification:
– Iowa Code Ann. § 602.1614 (West 1996 & Supp. 2012).
Statute cited to an electronic codification:
– 42 U.S.C.S. § 405(c)(2)(C) (LexisNexis 2012).
– 42 U.S.C.A. § 405(c)(2)(C) (Westlaw 2012).
– Iowa Code Ann. § 602.1614 (Westlaw 2012).

Principle 2: The reader of a statutory citation will expect that it refers to the statute as
currently in force unless the reference says otherwise. However, because statutes are
continually subject to amendment and compilations are put together at different times and
frequencies, it is useful even with a reference to a statute currently in force to be clear about
the nature or source of the currency data.
If the statute appears in a print compilation volume last published in 1998 and research
indicates the statute has not been amended, conventional practice would be to place 1998 as
the year in parenthesis even though print supplements, pocket parts, or much more recent
online compilations were consulted to verify the provision's currency.

26

Only if the statute had been amended since the principal volume of a cited compilation was
published would conventional practice call for the citation to refer to a supplement or a more
recent electronic compilation. It would have the the parenthetical read (Supp. 2012) if the
writer relied on a print supplement or pocket part published sometime in 2012 for the full
provisions of the statute, as amended, or (1996 & Supp. 2012) if the reader would have to
bring the supplement or pocket part together with the principal volume for the full text of the
reference. Use of an up-to-date electronic compilation simplifies the presentation of currency
information.

¡But see § 2-335!
§ 2-335. Statute Citations – Points of Difference in Citation Practice
§ 2-335(1) Examples
– Mich. Comp. Laws § x (year).
– Ind. Code § x (year). [Publisher's brand and "Ann." omitted.]

Point 1: Both The Bluebook and the ALWD Citation Manual direct a writer to cite to a
publicly produced or supervised statutory compilation (generally referred to as an "official"
code) if the provisions referred to are contained in it. In other cases, conventional practice,
encouraged by the major publishers and reflected in both citation guides, is to identify the
publisher of a commercially produced statutory compilation, and, with the two principal
annotated versions of the United States Code, to use abbreviations of their brand names
(U.S.C.A. and U.S.C.S.). Especially, as sources and versions have multiplied, however, usage
has moved toward the citing of statutes by means of their generic or "official" designation
without regard to the source actually used by the writer. If followed rigorously, this approach
involves dropping the superfluous notation ("Ann."), which simply indicates that the code
relied upon was annotated, and leaving the publisher's name or brand out of the parenthesis
containing the currency information. The existence or nonexistence of annotations in the
compilation relied on by the writer has no bearing on the statutory language itself, and, as a
consequence of the shifts in ownership and branding that have occurred in commercial law
publishing and the divergence between print and electronic versions of compilations bearing
the same brand, references to "the publisher" are no longer straightforward.
While this is the practice of many appellate courts, neither The Bluebook nor the ALWD
Citation Manual goes so far. While both remove branding elements from the name of state
(but not federal) statutory compilations, they still include references to the publisher in the
following parenthical. The ALWD Citation Manual does so in all cases where multiple print
editions exist, even if one of them is designated "official" by the state. The Bluebook omits
designating the publisher when the version has been designated "official" by the state. Both
manuals include "Ann." when the cited code is annotated.
To illustrate, the official compilation of Indiana statutes is cited "Ind. Code § x (year)."
According to The Bluebook citations to the commercial compilation of Indiana statutes long
known as "Burns Indiana Statutes Annotated" should take the form "Ind. Code Ann. § x
(LexisNexis year)" while those to "West's Annotated Indiana Code" should read "Ind. Code
Ann. § x (West year)." The ALWD Citation Manual treats the latter identically but, reflecting
27

what turns out to have been a short-lived branding strategy of Reed Elsevier (the corporate
parent of LexisNexis) would have citations to "Burns" (and U.S.C.S. plus many more)
attributed to "Lexis." Currently, however, the online versions of "Burns" show the parent
brand "LexisNexis" prominently and indicate that copyright is held by Matthew Bender &
Company, "a member of the LexisNexis Group." Meanwhile, Thomson Reuters has returned
to placing the brand "West" on its legal publications and services that, for a time, gave greater
prominence to the Thomson name. Finally, the ALWD Citation Manual includes the publisher
"Lexis" in citations to the Alaska Statutes ("Alaska Stat. § x (Lexis year)"), but The Bluebook
does not ("Alaska Stat. § x (year)") since that compilation is official.
§ 2-335(2) Examples
– Mich. Comp. Laws § x (year through ___). [More complete "current through" date
in place of year of "publication."]
– Ind. Code § x (year through ___). [More complete "current through" date in place
of year of "publication."]

Point 2: It is the practice in the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and a
majority of state courts to omit currency information from statute citations altogether unless
the provisions have been or are likely to be subject to amendment. Further, as already noted in
§ 2-320, methods of indicating the currency of a cited statutory compilation are in flux.
Traditional practice, based on the updating frequency of print compilations, called only for the
year of the compilation cited. Regularly updated electronic versions of state statutes generally
provide information on their cutoff or currency date with greater precision. Often this is
specified not as a date, per se, but in terms of a "legislative event" – the last included
enactment or the end of a session. The AALL Universal Citation Guide argues that the
addition of this more exact currency information to the year is a more effective measure than
year of publication or compilation alone in alerting the reader to the risk that the version of
the statute he or she consults may be different, by virtue of legislative change, from that
referenced by the citation. However, this recommendation has yet to be widely adopted.
§ 2-335(3) Examples
– AS x. [Per Alaska Supreme Court citation practice when citing to Alaska Statutes.]
– KRS x. [Per Kentucky Supreme Court citation practice when citing to Kentucky
Revised Statutes.]
– R.C. x. [Per Ohio Supreme Court citation practice when citing to Ohio Revised
Code.]

Point 3: One area of citation practice on which there is widespread state variation is the
abbreviation of the state's own code. The abbreviations used on the examples in this
introduction (§ 3-320), like the two dominant national citation references, are full enough to
distinguish unambiguously between a citation to a provision of the Alaska Statutes and a
section of the codes of Alabama, Arizona and Arkansas. Indeed, a standard and recurring
component of state statute and regulation citations is an abbreviation of the state name. When
context leaves little or no doubt about which state's statutes are being cited, including
importantly briefs submitted to and decisions rendered by the courts of a particular state,
significant citation space can saved with little or no loss by having the state name supplied by
28

implication. In decisions of the Alaska Supreme Court and briefs submitted to it, "AS" is
commonly used instead of "Alaska Stat."; in Kentucky it is understood that "KRS" stands for
"Kentucky Revised Statutes" and not statutes of the state of Kansas. At the extreme, this form
of state-specific citation dialect leaves off all explicit reference to the state. A reference in an
Ohio brief to "R.C." is understood as referring to Ohio's "Revised Code"; one in a New York
brief to a section of the "General Municipal Law" and one in a California brief to a section of
the "Penal Code" are understood as referring to the respective state's codified statutes.

Special Case 1 – Session Laws: Don't cite a statute to the session laws (the compiled
enactments of a legislative body during a particular session) if a codified version will serve
your purposes. This principle confines session law citations to:
•
•
•
•
•

very recent enactments (provisions not yet codified even in supplements or pocket
parts or online versions),
enactments that are not codified because they are not of general applicability,
situations where the reference is to enactment itself or to provisions that have since
been repealed or modified,
provisions that are so scattered across the code that a reference to the session laws is
more efficient, and
those rare cases in which the language in the codified version differs in some
significant way from the session laws.

A session law reference consists of: the name of the statute (or if not named "Act of [date]"),
its public law number ("Pub. L. No.") or equivalent state designation, and the source. In the
case of a recent enactment this will most likely be electronic. See § 2-110. Where a print
source is used the reference consists of a volume or year number followed by the name of the
publication, abbreviated ("Stat." or "U.S.C.C.A.N." in the case of a federal act) and a page
number. The year of enactment, in parentheses, is included in cases where that information is
not already part of one of the other citation components.

Special Case 3 – Named Acts: Some statutes are commonly referred to by name, and in
some of these cases, section references from the original legislation are still widely used. Such
references should never substitute for a core reference to the legislation as codified, but they
can be added to it.
§ 2-340(4) Example
– I.R.C. § 6091.

Special Case 4 – The Internal Revenue Code: An important exception to the general norms
for citation of federal statutes allows (but does not require) references to the Internal Revenue
Code to be in the form: I.R.C. § ___. This is a substitute for 26 U.S.C. § ___ (2006). So long
as it is clear from the context that the citation refers to the current tax code, the current year or
"through date" need not be included.
§ 2-340(5) Examples
– U.C.C. § 2-202 (amended 2003).
– Unif. Probate Code § 2-107 (amended 1990), 8(I) U.L.A. 87 (1998).
– Model Bus. Corp. Act § 10.01 (2002).

Special Case 5 – Uniform Acts and Model Codes: When a uniform act or model act or code
has been adopted by a state and is being referred to as the law of that state, it is cited like any
other state law. When a reference is to the uniform law or model code apart from its adoption
and interpretation in a particular state, the citation should consist of the name of the uniform
law or code (as abbreviated), section number, and the year that law or code (or major subpart)
was promulgated or last amended. In the case of uniform laws a parallel citation to the
Uniform Laws Annotated (U.L.A.) may be helpful.

§ 2-350 Examples
– Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code § 302-3 (2012).
– Des Moines, Iowa, Municipal Code § 8.04.040 (2012).

Ordinances governing cities, towns, or counties are cited like statutes. Just as the standard
form for a citation to a state statute includes the name of the state (abbreviated), an ordinance
citation is prefaced by the name of the political subdivision it governs.
§ 2-360. Treaty Citations [BB|ALWD]
§ 2-360(1) Examples
– North American Free Trade Agreement, U.S.-Can.-Mex., art. 705(3), Dec. 17,
1992, 32 I.L.M. 289 (1993).
– United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989,
http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm.
– Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4.A.3, Aug.
12, 1949, 75 U.N.T.S. 135.

Principle 1: The core of a citation to a treaty, international convention, or other international
agreement consists of three elements:
Element (a) - The name of the treaty or agreement
Element (b) - The date of signing or approval
Element (c) - A source for the text likely to be accessible to the reader
§ 2-360(2) Examples
– North American Free Trade Agreement, U.S.-Can.-Mex., art. 705(3), Dec. 17,
1992, 32 I.L.M. 289 (1993).
– United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989,
http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm.
– Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4.A.3, Aug.
12, 1949, 75 U.N.T.S. 135.

Principle 2: Three additional elements may be appropriate:
Element (a) - Conventions that are the the product of an international organization should
either include the organization's name as part of the name of the agreement or be preceded
by that name.
31

Element (b) - So long as there are no more than three parties to the agreement, their names
(abbreviated) should be listed, set off by commas and separated by hyphens, following the
agreement's name.
Element (c) - When citing to a portion of the agreement, the cited subdivision, as
designated in the agreement, should be included directly following the treaty name and
parties, if listed.
§ 2-400. How to Cite Regulations, Other Agency and Executive Material

Contents |

Index | Help | < | >

Regulations and other agency material, particularly the output of state agencies, has become
dramatically more accessible as print distribution has been supplemented or supplanted by
online dissemination. Print compilations of agency regulations in even the largest states
tended to be expensive and hard to keep up-to-date, characteristics that confined them to large
law libraries. Now most agency material is accessible on the Internet, much of it from public,
non-fee sources. Many adjudicative agencies are also now placing their decisions at a public
Web site. Greater accessibility should lead to more citation of this category of primary
material.
The relevant citation principles follow; section 3-400 provides both basic examples and
samples from all major U.S. jurisdictions.
§ 2-410. Regulation Citations – Most Common Form [BB|ALWD]
Like statutes, agency regulations are cited to codifications if possible.
§ 2-410(1) Examples
– 20 C.F.R. § 404.260 (2012) or 20 C.F.R. § 404.110 (2012 through Apr. 1).
– 49 C.F.R. § 236.403 (2011) or 49 C.F.R. § 236.403 (2012 through Oct. 19).
[April 1, 2012 is the cutoff date of the print compilation of title 20, October 1, 2011,
the cutoff for title 49. The second version for title 49 is based on a more up-to-date
commercial or government online source.]

Principle 1: The core of a citation to a codified federal regulation consists of three elements:
Element (a) - The title number followed by a space and "C.F.R." (for "Code of Federal
Regulations")
Element (b) - The section number preceded by the section symbol and a space
Element (c) - The year of the most recent compilation of that title (Note that the print
editions of the different titles are compiled on a staggered schedule.) or a more precise
"through" date (in parentheses)
No punctuation separates these elements. Nothing is italicized or underlined.
32

§ 2-410(2) Examples
– Code Me. R. 12 170 7 § 5 (2012),
http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/rules/12/170/170c007.doc.
– Minn. R. 3050.2600 (2012), http://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/?id=3050.2600.
– Tex. Admin. Code tit. 40, § 705.3101 (2012 effective Sept. 1),
http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.viewtac.

Principle 2: The core of a citation to a codified state regulation consists of comparable
elements, adjusted to the nomenclature of the particular codification. If the reader may not be
familiar with how to access the code and it is online (as most state codes now are), a parallel
electronic citation may be useful. See § 2-110.

¡But see § 2-415!
§ 2-415. Regulation Citations – Points of Difference in Citation Practice
§ 2-415 Examples
– 8 AAC 15.160 (2012). [Per Alaska Supreme Court citation practice when citing to
Alaska Administrative Code.]
– 405 KAR 1:120. [Per Kentucky Supreme Court citation practice when citing to
Kentucky Administrative Regulations Service.]

Point 1: State regulations are even more rarely cited outside the state in which they apply
than state statutes are. Consequently, their abbreviations according to settled usage within a
state often fill in the full identification of that state by implication. This is also true with
statutes. (See § 2-335(3).) Thus, while The Bluebook and ALWD Citation Manual call for
Alaska regulations to be cited to "Alaska Admin. Code tit. x, § y (year)," in decisions of the
Alaska Supreme Court and briefs submitted to it, an Alaska regulation will typically be cited
"[title] AAC [section] (year)."
§ 2-420. Regulation Citations – Variants and Special Cases [BB|ALWD]
§ 2-420 Examples
– Authorization of Representative Fees, 74 Fed. Reg. 48381, 48384 (Sept. 23, 2009)
(amending 20 C.F.R. § 404.1720).
– Revisions to Rules Authorizing the Operation of Low Power Auxiliary Stations in the
698-806 MHz Band, 75 Fed. Reg. 3639 (Jan. April 22, 2010) (amending 47 C.F.R. pt.
15).
– Adopted Permanent Rules Relating to Telephone Assistance Plans, 34 Minn. Reg.
818 (Dec. 7, 2009) (to be codified at Minn. R. 7817.0400).
– Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 3E1.1 (2009).

Special Case 1: Federal regulations not yet codified or citations to a regulation as originally
promulgated are cited to the Federal Register (Fed. Reg.), preceded by name or title of the
33

regulations. If the regulation is to be codified in C.F.R., the location where it will appear or
the portion it amends should, in most cases, be furnished parenthetically.
Special Case 2: State regulations not yet codified or citations to regulations as originally
promulgated are cited to an equivalent publication or Web site.
Special Case 3: Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which are not codified in C.F.R., are cited to
the manual in which they are published by the U.S. Sentencing Commission.
§ 2-450. Agency Adjudication Citations [BB|ALWD]
§ 2-450 Examples
– National Treasury Empls. Union, Chapter 65, 57 F.L.R.A. No. 3 (Mar. 12, 2001).
– Altercare of Hartville, 321 N.L.R.B. 847 (1996).
– H H 3 Trucking Inc., 345 N.L.R.B. No. 59 (Sept. 15, 2005),
http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d458007a338.

Agency adjudications are cited the same as judicial opinions (cases) (see § 2-200) with the
following differences of detail:
Principle 1: Names are not italicized or underlined.
Principle 2: The cited name is that of the first private party only (abbreviated as with
judicial opinions), or the official subject-matter title, omitting all procedural phrases. (If
the procedural posture of the case is important information it can be summarized in a
parenthetical phrase following the date.)
Principle 3: The agency's official reporter is cited whenever possible. If no official reporter
citation is available, the decision is cited with agency's assigned identification number and
full date, plus a parallel citation to an electronic source, an unofficial reporter or service if
possible.
Principle 4: If the name of the agency is not adequately revealed by the name of the
reporter, it should be included (abbreviated) in the parentheses ahead of the date.

¡But see § 2-455!

§ 2-455. Agency Adjudication Citations – Points of Difference in Citation
Practice
§ 2-455 Examples
– Natl. Treas. Empls. Union, Chapter 65 v. IRS, 57 F.L.R.A. No. 3 (Mar. 12, 2001).
[Per the ALWD Citation Manual.]
– Altercare of Hartville, 321 N.L.R.B. 847 (1996). [Per the ALWD Citation Manual.]
– H H 3 Trucking Inc., 345 N.L.R.B. No. 59 (Sept. 15, 2005),
http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d458007a338. [Per the ALWD
Citation Manual.]

Point 1: The ALWD Citation Manual calls for a format more tightly analogous to that
employed for judicial opinions, including the italicizing of party names.
§ 2-470. Agency Report Citations [BB|ALWD]
§ 2-470 Examples
–
– 1981 S.E.C. Ann. Rep. 21.
– U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, GAO-02-802, SSA: Enhanced Procedures and
Guidance Could Improve Service and Reduce Overpayments to Concurrent
Beneficiaries 11 (2002).

Principle 1: Citations to agency reports, published periodically in volumes, take the same
form as journal articles (see § 2-800).
Principle 2: Citations to agency reports that are titled and disseminated separately take the
same form as books by institutional authors (see § 2-720(1)). Where the agency numbers its
reports, as does the U.S. Government Accountability Office (formerly the General
Accounting Office) that designation should be included as part of the title.
§ 2-480. Citations to Executive Orders and Proclamations – Most Common
Form [BB|ALWD]
§ 2-480(1) Examples
– Exec. Order No. 12,893, 59 Fed. Reg. 4233 (Jan. 31, 1994).
– Proclamation No. 7202, 3 C.F.R. 48 (2000).

Principle 1: The core of a citation to a federal executive order or presidential proclamation
consists of four elements:
Element (a) - The designation "Exec. Order" or "Proclamation" followed by a space and
"No." (for number)
35

Element (b) - The order or proclamation number followed by a comma and space
Element (c) - A citation to the Federal Register in which the order or proclamation was
published (see § 2-420) or if it is likely to be more accessible the Code of Federal
Regulations edition into which it was compiled (i.e. that for the following year) followed
by a space
Element (d) - The date or year in parenthesis (the date of the Federal Register publication
or the year of the C.F.R. compilation, not the date of the order or proclamation)
§ 2-480(2) Examples
– Principles for Federal Infrastructure Investments, Exec. Order No. 12,893, 59 Fed.
Reg. 4233 (Jan. 31, 1994), http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executiveorders/pdf/12893.pdf.

http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgibin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2000_cfr_3v1&docid=3CFR7202.pdf.

Principle 2: Two additional additional elements may be appropriate:
Element (a) - The core elements can be preceded by the title of the order or proclamation
followed by a comma and space
Element (b) - With recent documents a parallel electronic citation may be useful; all
executive orders and proclamations from 1993 on are accessible online. See § 2-110.
§ 2-480(3) Examples
– Mich. Exec. Order No. 2003-4 (Feb. 27, 2003),
http://www.michigan.gov/granholm/0,4587,7-168-21975-62542--,00.html.

Principle 3: The core of a citation to a state governor's executive order or proclamation
consists of comparable elements preceded by the state abbreviation, adjusted to the
nomenclature of the particular compilation in which it appears (if any).

§ 2-485. Citations to Executive Orders and Proclamations – Points of Difference
in Citation Practice
§ 2-485 Examples
– Exec. Order No. 12,893, 59 Fed. Reg. 4233 (Jan. 31, 1994). [Per The Bluebook.]
– Proclamation No. 7202, 3 C.F.R. 48 (2000), available at

http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgibin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2000_cfr_3v1&docid=3CFR7202.pdf). [Per the ALWD
Citation Manual.]

Point 1: The ALWD Citation Manual calls for slightly different designations of orders and
proclamations, omits the abbreviation "No." and does not place commas in the numbers. It
also places the title of the order or proclamation in italics, when included, and treats parallel
Internet citations slightly differently.
§ 2-490. Citations to Attorney General and Other Advisory Opinions – Most
Common Form [BB|ALWD]

90 Md. Att'y Gen. Op. 17 (2005).

Principle 1: The core of a citation to an advisory opinion by the U.S. Attorney General, state
counterparts, and similar legal officers consists of two sets of elements:
Element (a) - The name of the office issuing the opinion (abbreviated) and the abbreviation
"Op."
Element (b) - A volume and page number followed by the year if the opinion has been
published. The opinion number, if any, and full date if it has not been.

Principle 1: Citations to arbitration decisions or awards take the same form as court cases if
the adversarial parties are named. See § 2-210.
Principle 2: Citations to arbitration decisions or awards take the same form as administrative
adjudications if the adversarial parties are not named. See § 2-450.
Principle 3: In either case the citation should include one additional information item – the
arbitrator's last name – in parentheses at the end of the citation.

Bluebook, the current edition of the ALWD Citation Manual, and widespread practice, no date
need be included so long as the citation's reference is to the rule currently in effect.

– Henry Julian Abraham, Justices, Presidents, and Senators 290-95 (5th ed.,

Point 1: While longstanding conventional practice, as reflected in The Bluebook, is to place
the volume number of a multi-volume work before the author's name, the ALWD Citation
Manual calls for a volume number to be placed following the title with the other subdivision
information.
41

Point 2: The Bluebook and the ALWD Citation Manual call for the same treatment of multiple
authors. The former more than the latter, however, indicates a presumption that with more
than two authors "et al." should be used.
Point 3: The ALWD Citation Manual calls for routine inclusion of the publisher's name
(abbreviated) in the parentheses, before the year of publication. Where there is an edition
number the publisher's name follows it, separated by a comma. The Bluebook directs insertion
of the publisher's name only when that is necessary in order to distinguish different publishers'
editions.

institution substituting for the name of an individual author. If an individual author is credited
for the work along with the institution, both are listed with the individual author coming first.
Where multiple units or division of the institution are listed on the work, the citation includes
the smallest unit first and then skips to the largest, omitting all in between. In cases where an
individual author is cited, the name of that author substitutes for the smallest unit.
§ 2-720(2) Examples
– Vill. of Grand View v. Skinner, 22 Envtl. L. Rep. (Envtl. Law Inst.) 20120 (2d Cir.
Oct. 24, 1991).
– Norling v. Valley Contracting, [2 Wages-Hours] Lab. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 35,543
(D.N.D. June 11, 1991).
– Flamme v. Wolf Ins. Agency, [Insurance] Auto. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 18,307 (Neb. Nov.
8, 1991).

Special Case 2 – Services: [BB|ALWD]
Compilations organized around specialized fields include a wide variety of material, ranging
from statutes to brief commentary. They are a frequent source of otherwise unpublished
cases.
Citations to material in such a service include the name or title of the cited document in
accordance with the rules applicable to its type (cases, administrative material, etc.). The
portion of the citation identifying the document's address in the service includes: volume,
abbreviated title (not italicized), publisher in parentheses, subdivision. In cases where the
42

volume designation is not simply a number it should be placed in brackets to separate it from
the work's title. The date accompanying the citation (in most cases, at the end, in parenthesis)
is the full date of the cited document.
§ 2-720(3) Examples
– Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 30 (1981).
– Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 57 cmt. b, illus. 3 (1982).

Special Case 3 – Restatements: [BB|ALWD]
Restatements are not attributed to an author; they are cited simply by name, subdivision, and
year.
§ 2-720(4) Example
– Francis M. Dougherty, Annotation, Insurer's Tort Liability for Wrongful or Negligent
Issuance of Life Policy, 37 A.L.R.4th 972, 974 (1985).
– Francis M. Dougherty, Annotation, Insurer's Tort Liability for Wrongful or Negligent
Issuance of Life Policy, 37 A.L.R.4th 972, at § 1 (1985).

Special Case 4 – Annotations: [BB|ALWD]
Annotations in the American Law Reports (A.L.R.) are treated as articles in a collection or
journal. Since the online versions in LexisNexis and Westlaw fail to show original interior
pagination, they require the use of section numbers in any pinpoint reference.

§ 2-820. Journal Article Citations – Variants and Special Cases [BB|ALWD]
Journal material other than articles by contributing authors is cited in similar form with the
following differences of detail:
§ 2-820(1) Examples
– John Moustakas, Note, Group Rights in Cultural Property: Justifying Strict
Inalienability, 74 Cornell L. Rev. 1179, 1183 n.12 (1989).
– Helen L. Parise, Comment, The Proper Extension of Tort Liability Principles in the
Managed Care Industry, 64 Temple L. Rev. 977 (1991).

Entrapment in New Jersey, 38 Rutgers L. Rev. 589 (1986).
– Betsy Vencil, Comment, 26 Nat. Resources J. 606 (1986).

Special Case 1 – Student Writing by a Named Student:
•
•

The category or type of piece is added after author's name (set off by commas).
The piece is identified only by category if there is no title or only a long digest-like
heading.
¡But see § 2-825(1)!
§ 2-820(2) Examples:

– Note, Computer Intellectual Property and Conceptual Severence, 103 Harv. L. Rev.
1046, 1057 (1990).
– Book Note, Selling One's Birth Rights, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1074 (1989) (reviewing
Martha A. Field, Surrogate Motherhood (1988)).

Special Case 2 – Unsigned Student Writing:
•
•

The category or type of piece is indicated where author's name would appear.
The piece is identified only by category if there is no title or only a long digest-like
heading.
¡But see § 2-825(1)!

46

§ 2-820(3) Examples
– John M. Balkin, Nested Opposition, 99 Yale L.J. 1669 (1990) (reviewing John M.
Ellis, Against Deconstruction (1989)).
– Anthony E. Cook, The Temptation and Fall of Original Understanding, 1990 Duke
L.J. 1163 (book review).
– Book Note, Selling One's Birth Rights, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1074 (1989) (reviewing
Martha A. Field, Surrogate Motherhood (1988)).

Special Case 3 – Book Reviews:
•

•

If the review is by an author who is not student editor, the core citation is followed by
a parenthetical simply identifying the piece as a book review or indicating the work
reviewed.
If the review by a student editor, it is cited like other student journal writing and given
the category "Book Note".
¡But see § 2-825(1)!
§ 2-820(4) Examples

– Charles Nesson, Agent Orange Meets the Blue Bus: Factfinding at the Frontiers of
Knowledge, 66 B.U. L. Rev. 521 (1986). [Part of a symposium]
– Project, Nineteenth Annual Review of Criminal Procedure: United States Supreme
Court and Court of Appeals 1988-1989, 78 Geo. L.J. 699 (1990).
– Symposium, Probability and Inference in the Law of Evidence, 66 B.U. L. Rev. 377
(1986).

Special Case 4 – Symposia and the Like:
•

•

Articles that are part of a symposium or survey are cited independently unless the
name of the symposium must be added to the title of the article for its scope to be
clear.
If the symposium or survey is cited as a unit, include the appropriate category label
before the title of the unit unless the title already includes the term.

47

§ 2-820(5) Examples
– John D. Feerick, Dedication, George Bundy Smith - A Good Lawyer, 68 Alb. L. Rev.
207 (2005).

Special Case 5 – Tributes, Dedications and Other Specially Labeled Articles:
•
•

With articles carrying a designation like "Tribute," "Dedication," or "Commentary,"
that label should be added after author's name (set off by commas).
If there is no named author, the designation is indicated where the author's name
would appear.
§ 2-820(6) Examples

– Michael Heise, Are Single-sex Schools Inherently Unequal?, Cornell L.F.,
Fall/Winter 2004, at 6, 7.
– Steve Weinberg, Missing and Presumed Murdered, A.B.A. J., Sept. 1995, at 62.

Special Case 6 – Articles in Journals with Separate Pagination in Each Issue:
•

•

each issue or in special issues that are separately paginated, the volume number is not
indicated, but the issue is identified by the date, as it appears on the cover, set off by
commas, following the journal name.
Page numbers, preceded by the word "at," follow the issue date.

§ 2-825. Journal Article Citations – Points of Difference in Citation Practice
§ 2-825 Examples
– John Moustakas, Note, Group Rights in Cultural Property: Justifying Strict
Inalienability, 74 Cornell L. Rev. 1179, 1183 n.12 (1989). [Per The Bluebook.]
– John Moustakas, Student Author, Group Rights in Cultural Property: Justifying
Strict Inalienability, 74 Cornell L. Rev. 1179, 1183 n.12 (1989). [Per the ALWD
Citation Manual.]
– John D. Feerick, Dedication, George Bundy Smith - A Good Lawyer, 68 Alb. L. Rev.
207 (2005). [Per The Bluebook.]
– John D. Feerick, George Bundy Smith - A Good Lawyer, 68 Alb. L. Rev. 207
(2005). [Per the ALWD Citation Manual.]
– Steve Weinberg, Missing and Presumed Murdered, A.B.A. J., Sept. 1995, at 62.
[Per The Bluebook.]
– Steve Weinberg, Missing and Presumed Murdered, 81 ABA J. 62 (Sept. 1995). [Per
the ALWD Citation Manual.]

48

Point 1: Instead of distinguishing student writing by following the author's name with a
specific category or type label such as "Note" the ALWD Citation Manual calls for use of the
generic label "Student Author".
Point 2: The ALWD Citation Manual does not call for the inclusion of an article's special
designation in its citation.
Point 3: With separately paginated issues, the ALWD Citation Manual does not leave off the
volume number or move the page number to a different location, but identifies the issue by
the date or number appearing on the cover, in the concluding parenthesis. (It also abbreviates
the American Bar Association as "ABA" rather than "A.B.A.")

(Horn Dep. 99:23-101:5, July 22, 2005, ECF No. 22.)

References to the record and other case documents in a brief or memorandum are placed in
parentheses. The document's name is not italicized or underlined, but initial letters are
capitalized. Standard abbreviations (§ 4-900) exist for many of the document types. Pinpoint
citations are indicated using the division (paragraph, number, page) of the document in
question. Citation to a particular page (or range of page numbers) in the record is,
customarily, preceded by the word "at" followed by the page number. The date of the event is
furnished with depositions, trial testimony, and in other situations where it will aid the reader.
When the document is held in a court case management system like the federal courts'
CM/ECF which assigns document numbers that designation should also be included.

Additional Examples - State Regulation Citations
In states where a citation variant appears against a different background there is a distinct
regulation citation format used within the jurisdiction by state courts and those submitting
memoranda or briefs to them.
The Bluebook and ALWD Citation Manual frequently diverge in their abbreviations for
compilations of state regulations. The Bluebook normalizes all code abbreviations to begin
with the state name. For example, Maine's compilation, as published by Weil (now owned
by LexisNexis) is entitled "Code of Maine Rules." The ALWD Citation Manual renders that
as "Code Me. R."; but The Bluebook converts it to "Me. Code. R." A comparable
divergence exists with all 12 states plus the District of Columbia for which Weil publishes
regulations. In all instances where there are competing abbreviations, the following chart
includes the one that tracks the name given the compilation by the state itself or the
principal publisher. In addition, while The Bluebook sometimes, but not consistently,
includes the name of the publisher of a compilation, e.g., Weil, in the concluding
parenthesis, ahead of the currency information, the following examples, following the
approach of the ALWD Citation Manual and the AALL Universal Citation Guide, omit
reference to the publisher in all cases.

§ 4-000. ABBREVIATIONS AND OMISSIONS USED IN CITATIONS

Contents | Index | Help | <

|>

§ 4-100. Words Abbreviated in Case Names [BB|ALWD]
Set out below is a table of words and their Bluebook abbreviations with links to examples:
A-B | C | D-E | F-L | M-O | P-R | S-Z
Abbreviate the listed words wherever they appear in a party's name that is part of a citation. In
addition, abbreviate any state that is included in a party name. (See § 4-500.) When the case is
being referred to in a sentence of the text itself rather than simply as a citation only the words
starred [*] in the table below should be abbreviated and then only when not at the beginning
of a party's name.
Any other word of eight letters or more not on the following list may also be abbreviated if
the abbreviation chosen saves substantial space and reasonably connotes the original word. As
a consequence of this Bluebook principle case names prepared according to the ALWD
Citation Manual's far more extensive list of "General Abbreviations" will, for the most part,
comply, as well, with The Bluebook. There are a few minor points of divergence, however,
and one systematic difference, on which the ALWD Citation Manual has recently softened its
stance. For a number of words, but following no consistent pattern, The Bluebook uses
contractions (e.g., Eng'r and Int'l, though curiously Envtl.). Prior to the fourth edition, the
ALWD Citation Manual abbreviations used no apostrophes; all ended with periods (e.g., Engr.
and Intl.). The fourth edition authorizes use of contractions as an alternative (e.g., Engr. or
Eng'r, Intl. or Int'l).
Except when the abbreviation list explicitly provides for the plural, the plural of a listed word
is abbreviated by adding an "s" to the abbreviation of the singular.
Thus:
•
•
•

Eng'r Eng'rs
Enter. Enters.
Mfr. Mfrs.

§ 5-000. UNDERLINING AND ITALICS [BB|ALWD]

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

When briefs and memoranda were prepared on typewriters, emphasized text was underlined.
While older citation reference works may still call for underlining, that format has largely
been replaced by the use of italics, made possible by word-processing software and modern
printers.
§ 5-100. In Citations

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

The following citation elements should be italicized:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

case names (including procedural phrases)
book titles
titles of journal articles
introductory signals used in citation sentences or clauses
prior or subsequent history explanatory phrases
words or phrases attributing one cited authority to another source
the cross reference words: "id.," "supra," and "infra"

If underlining is used instead of italics it should continue under successive words that are part
of the same phrase but break between items. When "e.g." appears with another signal the two
together are treated as a single item. Punctuation that is part of any of the above elements is
italicized along with it, but punctuation that separates that element from other parts of the
citation should not be.
§ 5-200. In Text

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

The following words or phrases should be italicized when they appear in the text of a brief or
legal memorandum:
•
•
•
•

references to titles or case names in the text without full citation (even those which
would, in full citation, not be underlined)
foreign words that have not been assimilated into lawyer jargon
quoted words that were italicized in the original
emphasized words

§ 6-000. PLACING CITATIONS IN CONTEXT

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

§ 6-100. Quoting [BB|ALWD]
Principle 1: Short quotations (fewer than 50 words) are generally enclosed in quotation
marks «e.g.». Any quotation marks within such a quote are converted to a single mark (').
Principle 2: Longer quotations (50 words or more) and shorter quotations to which the author
wishes to give special emphasis are set off from the text by being indented both right and left
(without quotation marks) «e.g.».
Principle 3: Both forms of quotation are followed immediately by a citation to the quoted
work. (With an indented quotation the citation is not part of the indented material, but begins
flush with the left margin «e.g.».) When the quoted work itself includes a quotation, that
quotation should if possible be attributed to the original work in a parenthetical clause. And
when that quotation shows alterations or omissions that should be indicated with the
parenthetical clause "(alteration in original)".
Principle 4: Changes to a quoted work are shown with square brackets and ellipses (" . . . ")
«e.g.». When omitted material comes at the beginning of a quotation the omission is shown by
capitalizing the first letter of the first quoted word and placing that letter in brackets rather
than with ellipses. Changes in emphasis and omissions of citations or footnotes are indicated
by parenthetical clauses.
§ 6-200. Citations and Related Text [BB|ALWD]

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

Principle 1: While footnote citation is the norm for law journal and treatise writing, citations
in memoranda and briefs are integrated with the text «e.g.».
Principle 2: Under most circumstances citations should take the form of citation sentences,
beginning with capital letters and ending with periods, directly following the sentence they
support or the quotation they identify «e.g.». When a citation or citations relate to a portion of
a sentence they should be embedded in the sentence as a citation clause, set off by commas,
directly following that portion «e.g.».
Principle 3: Multiple citations whether within a citation sentence or a citation clause are set
off from one another with semi-colons «e.g.».
§ 6-300. Signals [BB|ALWD]

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

Citing an authority without any preceding word to clarify or qualify its connection to the text
represents that the citation directly states the proposition or identifies a quotation or authority
with which the citation is associated «e.g.». There is a standard set of clarifying or qualifying
words used with citations. Placed in front of a citation these words are italicized (or
underlined). When instead they form the verb of a sentence that includes the citation they are
not italicized (or underlined). No comma separates the signal from the rest of the citation,
134

except for "e.g." which needs a comma before and after it. Only the signal beginning a
citation sentence has its initial letter capitalized. The standard clarifying or qualifying words
include:
(a) Signals that indicate support.
•

E.g.,
o

•

Accord
o

•

Authority states the proposition with which the citation is associated. Other
authorities, not cited, do as well «e.g.». "E.g." used with other signals (in which
case it is preceded by a comma) similarly indicates the existence of other
authorities not cited.
Used following citation to authority referred to in text when there are
additional authorities that either state or clearly support the proposition with
which the citation is associated, but the text quotes only one. Similarly, the law
of one jurisdiction may be cited as being in accord with that of another «e.g.».

See
Authority supports the proposition with which the citation is associated either
implicitly or in the form of dicta «e.g.».
See also
o Authority is additional support for the proposition with which the citation is
associated (but less direct than that indicated by "see" or "accord"). "See also"
is commonly used to refer readers to authorities already cited or discussed
«e.g.». The use of a parenthetical explanation of the source material's relevance
following a citation introduced by "see also" is encouraged.
Cf.
o Authority supports by analogy "Cf." literally means "compare." The citation
will only appear relevant to the reader if it is explained. Consequently,
parenthetical explanations of the analogy are strongly recommended «e.g.».
o

•

•

(b) Signals that suggest a useful comparison.
•

Compare ... with ...
o Comparison of authorities that supports proposition. Either side of the
comparison can have more than one item linked with "and" «e.g.». Parenthetical
explanations of comparison are strongly recommended.

(c) Signals that indicate contradiction.
•

Contra
o

•

But see
o

•

Authority directly states the contrary of the proposition with which the citation
is associated «e.g.».
Authority clearly supports the contrary of the proposition with which citation is
associated «e.g.».

But cf.
o

Authority supports the contrary of the position with which the citation is
associated by analogy. Parenthetical explanations of the analogy are strongly
135

recommended. The word "but" is omitted from the signal when it follows
another negative signal «e.g.».
(d) Signals that indicate background material.
•

See generally
o Authority presents useful background. Parenthetical explanations of the source
materials' relevance are encouraged «e.g.».

(e) Combining a signal with "e.g."
•

E.g.,
o

In addition to the cited authority, there are numerous others that state, support,
or contradict the proposition (with the other signal indicating which) but
citation to them would not be helpful or necessary. The preceding signal is
separated from "e.g." by a comma «e.g.».

§ 6-400. Order [BB|ALWD]

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

Sometimes multiple citations or "strings" are necessary.
Principle 1: When a series of citations includes material grouped after more than one signal,
the signals should appear in the order in which they are listed in § 6-300.
Principle 2: Section 6-300 breaks signals (and their references) into four different "types": (a)
supportive; (b) comparative; (c) contradictory; and (d) background. Signals of the same type
must be strung together within a single citation sentence and separated by semicolons.
According to The Bluebook signals of different types should be grouped in different citation
sentences. In other words, a period should end the string of authorities indicating support, and
any authorities in contradiction, preceded by the appropriate signal, should follow in a
separate citation sentence. The ALWD Citation Manual allows all to be contained in a single
sentence with only a semicolon separating the four different categories and their signals.
Principle 3: When more than one citation is preceded by the same signal, the citations are
grouped by type in the following order:
•
•
•

•
•
•

constitutions (U.S. first, followed by states in alphabetical order*)
statutes (U.S. first, followed by states in alphabetical order*)
cases (U.S. first, followed by states in alphabetical order* and grouped within each
jurisdiction by court in descending order, with decisions of a single court** arranged
chronologically, most recent first)
regulations (U.S. first, followed by states in alphabetical order*)
books (arranged alphabetically by last name of author)
journal articles (arranged alphabetically by last name of author)

* If the writing concerns the law of a particular state, citations to the constitution, statutes,
cases, and regulations of that state should, however, precede the rest.
136

** The Bluebook and the ALWD Citation Manual take opposing positions on whether the
circuits of the U.S. Courts of Appeals and different districts of the U.S. District Courts should
be treated as separate courts for this purpose. The Bluebook states without qualification that
all circuits should be viewed as one court, while the ALWD Citation Manual specifies that
each circuit and district be treated as a separate court. Neither approach works in all cases. In
a brief to the Second Circuit of the U.S. Courts of Appeals or a U.S. District Court on whom
its decisions are binding, decisions of that circuit should be treated as one court, while those
of other circuits can reasonably be lumped together as those of a single court. The Bluebook's
approach, as applied to courts with subunits, is inappropriate in any context where decisions
of all those circuits or districts or divisions do not carry the same precedential weight.

Principle: Once a full citation to a case, statute, regulation, book or journal article has been
provided, subsequent references within the same discussion can be less complete. The less
complete or "short form" citation must clearly identify the referenced work. Short form

Adapted from Respondent's Brief, Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee,
505 U.S. 672 (1992).
Since the 1974 decision in Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298 (1974), this Court
has relied upon public forum analysis to decide cases in which persons have sought to use
government property for expressive activity in violation of rules which restrict or prohibit
such activity. See United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 725 (1990).
This Court has held that a site owned by the government is a traditional public forum only if it
is among "those places which 'by long tradition or by government fiat have been devoted to
assembly and debate."' Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802, quoting, Perry Educ. Ass'n, 460 U.S. at 45.
This description hearkens back to the often-quoted passage from Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496
(1939):
Wherever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust
for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly,
communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the
streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities,
rights, and liberties of citizens.
Id. at 515.
The Port Authority airports' sole purpose of facilitating air travel is reflected in all of their
characteristics - planning, operation, design, usage, financing, lack of integration with
142

neighboring communities, presence of captive audiences, and unique congestion and security
problems. These characteristics both attest to the special purpose of the Port Authority air
terminals and distinguish them from traditional public fora. In previous cases, this Court has
examined the nature of alleged public fora to determine their public forum status. See, e.g.,
Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720; Greer, 424 U.S. 824; Lehman, 418 U.S. 298 .
4. Captive Audiences
The presence of captive audiences in air terminals distinguish such terminals from the
traditional public fora of streets and parks. Captive audiences exist throughout the air
terminals – at enplaning and deplaning points, at ticket counters, security checkpoints,
baggage conveyor belts, and car rental and other ground transportation counters. At all of
these locations, travelers tend to remain in place in order to complete travel-related tasks
(Superintendent's Statement at 58-60 (JA 458); Anderson Affidavit at 9 (JA 488)). See
Doughty, supra note 13, at 7. As noted by Justice Douglas with regard to the patrons of public
transportation vehicles, the rights of such captive audiences "to be free from forced intrusions
on their privacy" would be violated if they were forced to be the object of uninvited
persuasion. Lehman, 418 U.S. at 307 (1974) (Douglas, J., concurring); cf. Consolidated
Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S. 530, 542 (1980).
This Court has explicitly stated that a public forum does not exist merely because persons are
freely permitted to enter a government owned site. Indeed, the Court has ". . . expressly
rejected the suggestion that 'whenever members of the public are permitted freely to visit a
place owned or operated by the Government, then that place becomes a "public forum" for
purposes of the First Amendment.'" United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 686 (1985)
(quoting Greer, 424 U.S. at 836); see also United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983).
Finally, it is equally clear that the usefulness of government property as a site for expressive
activity does not make such property a traditional public forum under applicable Supreme
Court precedent. In Members of the City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789
(1984), which held that lampposts are not public fora for the posting of signs, this Court
rejected in unequivocal terms the proposition that a publicly-owned facility is a public forum
because it would be a useful place for the communication of ideas: "Lampposts can of course
be used as signposts, but the mere fact that government property can be used as a vehicle for
communication does not mean that the Constitution requires such uses to be permitted. Cf.
United States Postal Serv. v. Greenburgh Civic Ass'ns, 453 U.S. at 131." Id. at 814 (footnote
omitted); see also Albertini, 472 U.S. at 686; Greer, 424 U.S. at 838 n.10.
Plaintiffs' reference to the alleged decline of downtown street life by the development of
skyways and other street alternatives in city centers is clearly irrelevant to the issue at bar.
The merits or demerits of such developments should be debated by planning commissions or
zoning boards who determine the nature of our cities. See, e.g., William H. Whyte, City 193221 (1988). Any perceived failure of responsible planning bodies to foster the development of
urban streetscapes provides no basis for holding that the Port Authority air terminals are
public fora.
Second, the alleged role of rail terminals as public fora is irrelevant because rail terminals,
unlike Port Authority air terminals, are located in the center of a city. If the concourse of
143

Grand Central Station or the waiting room of a small town rail depot served as a meeting
place for people going about their daily business, it was because the rest of the community
was a sidewalk's width away. See H. Roger Grant & Charles H. Bohi, The Country Railroad
Station in America 8-9 (1978); William D. Middleton, Grand Central 109 (1978). Clearly, the
same is not true of the Port Authority's air terminals. Although two people in Midtown
Manhattan might agree to meet "under the golden clock" of Grand Central Terminal whether
or not they were going to take a train, see William D. Middleton, Grand Central 109 (1978),
it is highly unlikely that two people who had no intention of taking air flights would agree to
meet at any of the Port Authority airports.
Moreover, contrary to Plaintiff's assertions, as an historical matter, it is far from clear that rail
stations and terminals served as public fora in the First Amendment sense. Plaintiffs fail to
document that solicitation and distribution of literature actually occurred at railroad terminals.
Plaintiffs also ignore the fact that railroad terminals were privately owned, and, therefore, any
solicitation or distribution of literature which took place was at the pleasure of the private
entities which owned the terminals. See generally United Transp. Union v. Long Island R.R.,
455 U.S. 678, 686 (1982); H. Roger Grant & Charles H. Bohi, The Country Railroad Station
in America 11-15 (1978).(22)
The distribution of literature has similar effects on pedestrian flow. Air passengers must alter
their path to avoid the distributor, or pause to take literature and perhaps stop to read it or to
throw it in a wastebin. Significantly, Plaintiff's themselves concede that "literature distribution
. . . might well be as disruptive to a traveller 'hurrying to catch a plane or to arrange ground
transportation' as a request for a voluntary donation." Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 22
(citation omitted). And, of course, if Plaintiffs were entitled to engage in such activity, others
would have the right to do so as well. As noted by this Court in Heffron v. ISKCON, "The
inquiry must not only involve ISKCON, but all other organizations that would be entitled to
distribute, sell or solicit if the . . . rule may not be enforced with respect to ISKCON." 452
U.S. 640, 654 (1981); accord Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288,
296-97 (1984).
It is well established that even in a public forum, the government is not powerless to regulate
First Amendment activity. Although it is true that all communication may not be excluded
from a public forum, content-neutral regulations may be enforced if they are reasonable and
narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interests, and leave open ample alternative
channels of communication. E.g., Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460
U.S. at 46; Clark, 468 U.S. at 293. The Port Authority's restriction of solicitation and
distribution of literature to sidewalks adjacent to air terminal buildings satisfies this test.
Adapted from Children of Bedford, Inc. v. Petromelis, 77 N.Y.2d 713, 726-727, 573
N.E.2d 541, 553, 570 N.Y.S.2d 453, 464 (1991), vacated, 112 S.Ct. 859 (1991).
If the only purpose of section 632-a was to compensate victims, however, petitioners'
contention that the State's needs could be met by other, less burdensome means would be
more persuasive. Manifestly, article 22 and the general civil procedures address that need.
Section 632-a provides not only a method for victims to obtain compensation, however, it also
meets other compelling governmental interests. First, it preserves the victim's equitable right
to assets earned by a criminal as a result of the victimization. Compare Executive Law 631
144

with 632-a. If there is no victim a necessary requirement for implementation of the statute is
lacking, section 632-a does not apply and the criminal may discuss the crime without
restraint. E.g., compare Halmi v. Crime Victims Bd., N.Y. L.J., June 5, 1986, at 12 (N.Y. Sup.
Ct. June 4 1986), aff'd, 128 A.D.2d 411 (prostitution is victimless crime) and St. Martins
Press v. Zweibel, N.Y. L.J., Feb. 26, 1990, at 25 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Feb. 24, 1990) (securities
fraud based on leaking market information) with Simon & Schuster v. Fischetti, 916 F.2d 777
(2d. Cir. 1991) and this case. But if there are victims and the criminal profits from
reenactment or depiction of the crime, then the victims who have been injured by the criminal
act, and the State, which has been called upon to render aid to those victims, should have the
first claim to that money. They should be compensated before the criminal.
Adapted from McCann v. Scaduto, 71 N.Y.2d 164, 182-183, 519 N.E.2d 309, 326, 524
N.Y.S.2d 398, 416-417 (1987).
We reject the above arguments for the Secretary's exercise of an interim rate authority
essentially for the same reasons that the court below rejected them. The Natural Gas Act, like
most modern ratemaking statutes, provides for a plenary ratemaking authority and vests in it
one body, there, the Federal Power Commission. As the Supreme Court held in Tennessee
Gas, an interim authority follows naturally from a plenary authority under the usual
"necessary and proper" clause. What the government has failed to understand in urging upon
us a similar argument in the present case is that such a holding necessarily depends upon the
existence of a plenary authority. In this case the rate developer has none; the scheme set out in
section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 divides rate authority and vests it in two separate
branches of the government. The government's suggested approach assumes the validity of
their conclusion even before the process of deduction has begun. But see Montana Power Co.
v. Edwards, 531 F. Supp. 8 (D. Or. 1981) (adopting the approach attacked in this paragraph);
Pacific Power & Light Co. v. Duncan, 499 F. Supp. 672 (D. Or. 1980) (same); cf. Colorado
River Energy Distribs. Ass'n v. Lewis, 516 F. Supp. 926 (D.D.C. 1981) (correctly relying on
Tennessee Gas in hydroelectric ratemaking case under section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project
Act of 1939, 43 U.S.C. § 485h(c) (1976), which gives the Secretary plenary authority). To
resolve this case, we are forced to examine the substantive provisions of the Flood Control
and DOE Acts, which we have done in the first three Parts of this opinion.
Adapted from Respondent's Brief, United States v. Navajo Nation, No. 01-1375 (Oct.
9, 2002)
A. The Ideal of Tribal Self-Determination Does Not Dilute Trust Duties.
In the space of 20 pages, the Government's brief transforms the modern federal policy
favoring tribal self-determination from a supposed "focus" of IMLA to its "central aim." See
Pet. Br. 18, 19, 20, 38. Contra Kerr-McGee, 471 U.S. at 200. It repeatedly offers, never with
any citation to authority, that the historic requirement of federal approval of Indian land
transactions is merely to give "backstop protection" to the tribes, whatever that might be. E.g.,
Pet. Br. 18, 43, 49. Contra Tuscarora, 362 U.S. at 118-19; Sunderland, 266 U.S. at 234. The
Government unsuccessfully asserted in Mitchell II that the federal policy favoring Indian selfdetermination compromises trust duties. See Brief for the United States, No. 81-1748, at 35.
That argument has gained no force in the intervening 20 years.

§ 7-000. CROSS REFERENCE TABLES

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

§ 7-100. Introduction
The principles and practices described in this Introduction to Basic Legal Citation are
elaborated in far greater specificity (and with differences noted throughout this work) in two
citation references widely used in U.S. law schools.
This concluding segment contains a set of point by point cross-references to those books.
Tables set out in subsequent sections have been designed to enable users of this introduction
to find the relevant treatment of each citation principle or category of material covered here in
either The Bluebook (§ 7-300) or the ALWD Citation Manual (§ 7-400), whichever they are
working from.
In addition, because the current Bluebook is but the latest in a long succession of editions, it
being the nineteenth, this segment offers an inventory of the most recent changes of
significance. See § 7-200.
A concluding table (§ 7-500) furnishes state by state access to citation examples of the three
most frequently cited categories of primary law material – cases, statutes, and regulations –
noting those points on which the norms and practice of each state diverge from the
prescriptions of the "national" guides.

146

§ 7-200. Significant Changes in The Bluebook:

Contents | Index | Help | < | >

19th edition
The nineteenth edition made even fewer significant changes than its immediate predecessor.
The "Bluepages" – the sole title now given the introductory material introduced in the
eighteenth – and accompanying tables expanded from forty-three pages to fifty-one.
Expansion and elaboration occurred throughout, most notably in the concluding set of tables
(which comprise over half the volume). They grew by nearly forty percent. The bulk of that
growth was concentrated in T2's coverage of foreign jurisdictions, from the Argentine
Republic to the Republic of Zambia.
Electronic Media
Finally acknowledging that the Internet has for many types of legal material supplanted print
distribution, The Bluebook now sanctions citation to electronic documents obtained from
reliable online sources "as if they were the original print," permitting the omission of URL
information in such cases.
18th edition
The Bluebook's eighteenth edition made few changes of substance. The book's format was
revised; numerous rules were clarified; the treatment of foreign and international materials
was expanded; and the tables were both added to and extended. The Bluebook continues to
deal predominantly with the citation needs and norms of law journal writing. However, the
material previously relegated to nineteen pages of "practitioner notes" has, in this latest
edition, been expanded into a first section entitled "An Introduction to Basic Legal Citation"
(this work's title since its release in 1993). That section is accompanied by a new set of tables
furnishing references to local (jurisdiction-specific) citation rules and style guides,
information that has been included in the ALWD Citation Manual from the start.
Electronic Media
The Bluebook's coverage of Internet-based material significantly expanded and rationalized.
While the seventeenth edition divided Internet citations into three categories, the eighteenth
reduced the number to two – direct citations of material accessible only online and parallel
citations furnished to facillitate access to material distributed in print, but not widely available
in that form.
17th edition
Introductory Signals
The introductory signal rule changes made by the sixteenth edition were reversed in the
seventeenth. Rule 1.2 now provides as it did prior to 1996. "E.g." is back as a separate signal
and "contra" is restored.
147

Case Name Abbreviations
Rule 10.2.2 no longer spares the first or only word of a party name from abbreviation if it is in
the table of abbreviated words (T.6). In addition, that table has been expanded.
Recognition of Vendor- and Medium-Neutral Case Citations
Rule 10.3.3 acknowledges the spreading phenomenon of court adopted vendor- and mediumneutral citation systems, requires the use of such a system where the jurisdiction has adopted
one. 10.3.1(b) requires the addition of a parallel citation to a regional reporter even though the
rule establishing a vendor, medium-neutral citation system may not.
Listing of Authors
Previously the Bluebook insisted on use of "et al." rather than a full listing of author names
when a book had more than two authors. The revised Rule 15.1.1 loosens up to permit a full
list when "the names of the authors are relevant."
Recognition of Electronic Media
Electronic and other nonprint resources (commercial online systems, public and commercial
internet sites, CD-ROM, Microform and more) have been broken out of Rule 17 (which now
deals only with unpublished and forthcoming sources) and placed in a new Rule 18. (The
former Rules 18, 19, and 20 have been renumbered accordingly.)

Examples from Ex parte Beverly Enterprises-Alabama, Inc., 812 So. 2d 1189
(Ala. 2001)
....
The Alabama Administrative Code prescribes 18 different standards for the CON Review
Board to use when applicants are competing for available beds. See Ala. Admin. Code (State
Health Planning and Development Agency), Rule 410-1-6-.01 through .18. The CON Review
Board subsequently voted 4-3 to award all 72 beds to Mercy. Beverly appealed this decision
to an FHO, asserting that the CON Review Board had made substantial errors of fact and law,
had violated fixed standards, had failed to apply the correct criteria, and had acted in an
arbitrary and capricious manner.
....
The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court, without an opinion. In
its petition for certiorari review, Beverly claims that the holding of the Court of Civil Appeals
conflicts with that of Forest Manor, Inc. v. State Health Planning & Development Agency,
723 So. 2d 75 (Ala.Civ.App. 1998), in two areas. It argues (1) that the opinion of the Court of
Civil Appeals conflicted with its holding in Forest Manor that the CON Review Board's
wrongful application of its review criteria renders the decision arbitrary, and (2) that the
decision by the Court of Civil Appeals to reinstate the CON Review Board's original award
deviated from the scope of review set forth in Forest Manor.

The standard of judicial review applied to rulings of administrative agencies differs from that
applied to rulings of trial courts. An appellate court will affirm a ruling of a lower court if
there is any valid reason to do so, even a reason not presented to -- or rejected by -- the lower
court. See McKenzie Methane Corp. v. M-W Drilling, Inc., 653 So. 2d 982, 984 (Ala. 1995).
See also Smith v. Equifax Servs., Inc., 537 So. 2d 463 (Ala. 1988). . . .
In Forest Manor, the main dispute centered on which entity was entitled to the presumption of
correctness on appeal -- the CON Review Board or the FHO. The Court of Civil Appeals
properly resolved the dispute in that case in favor of the FHO:
"Thus, because the FHO's order (and not the CONRB's order) is the final agency decision
to which a presumption of correctness applies, we must determine whether his conclusions
… were themselves 'arbitrary, capricious, or [contrary to] applicable law.'"
Forest Manor, 723 So. 2d at 80. See also, Ala. Administrative Code, Rule 410-1-8-.26. "The
agency order shall be taken as prima facie just and reasonable and the court shall not
substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of
fact …." § 41-22- 20(k), Ala. Code 1975. "The decision ofthe fair hearing officer is the final
decision of the Board." Alacare Home Health Servs., Inc. v. Baptist Hosp. of Gadsden, Inc.,
655 So. 2d 995, 996 (Ala.Civ.App. 1994).
....
Before the trial court's denial of the motion to dismiss, there had been instructive, but
nonbinding, revenue rulings issued by the Alabama Department of Revenue; those rulings
indicate that the rental tax could be billed to or passed on to the lessee as a tax or as an
additional cost of the lease. Ala. Admin. Code (Dep't of Rev.), chapter 810-6-5-.09 ("Leasing
and Rental of Tangible Personal Property").

Examples from State v. Dupier, 118 P.3d 1039 (Alaska 2005)
....
The court of appeals summarized the charges against Dupier, Miller, and Twohy and the trial
court proceedings as follows . . . State v. Dupier, 74 P.3d 922, 927-28 (Alaska App. 2003).
....
The facts of this case are undisputed. Appellees John Dupier, Rodman E. Miller, and Philip J.
Twohy each held Individual Fishing Quotas (IFQs) to fish in federal waters. In 2001, after
fishing legally in federal waters, the fishers separately attempted to land their catches in
Alaska without first obtaining state permits from the Commercial Fisheries Entry
Commission (CFEC). None of the fishers attempted to fish in state waters. The State charged
the fishers with possessing commercially taken fish in state waters without having a valid
interim-use permit, in violation of 20 AAC 05.110.
....
The scope of the CFEC's authority to require permits within state waters turns on the language
in the Alaska statutes governing interim-use permits, particularly AS 16.43.210(a), but also
AS 16.43.140(a), AS 16.10.267(a)(1), and AS 16.05.675. Following the court of appeals
decision in this case, the legislature amended AS 16.43.210(a) so that it is now clear that the
CFEC may issue interim-use permits for all Alaska fisheries, regardless of whether the fishery
is subject to limited entry.
....
The State argues that the 2004 amendment to AS 16.43.210(a) serves as a legislative
clarification of pre-existing law. But in Hillman v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., we
reasoned: "While the legislature is fully empowered to declare present law by legislation, it is
not institutionally competent to issue opinions as to what a statute passed by an earlier
legislature meant." 758 P.2d 1248, 1252-53 (Alaska 1988). We have followed the Hillman
rule in a number of subsequent cases. See State, Dep't of Revenue v. OSG Bulk Ships, Inc.,
961 P.2d 399, 406 n.13 (Alaska 1998); Univ. of Alaska v. Tumeo, 933 P.2d 1147, 1156
(Alaska 1997); Hickel v. Cowper, 874 P.2d 922, 925 n.7 (Alaska 1994); Flisock v. State, Div.
of Ret. & Benefits, 818 P.2d 640, 645 (Alaska 1991); Wrangell Forest Prods. v. Alderson, 786
P.2d 916, 918 n.1 (Alaska 1990). In this case, we decline to treat the 2004 amendment as a
legislative clarification of the pre-existing law.

Examples from Ry-Tan Constr., Inc. v. Wash. Elem. Sch. Dist. No. 6, 210 Ariz.
419, 111 P.3d 1019 (2005)
....
¶17 Section 27 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts provides that:
Manifestations of assent that are in themselves sufficient to conclude a contract will not be
prevented from so operating by the fact that the parties also manifest an intention to prepare
and adopt a written memorial thereof; but the circumstances may show that the agreements
are preliminary negotiations.
159

Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 27 (1981). In support of the proposition that Arizona has
adopted this section, the court refers to three recent decisions of the court of appeals. See
Tabler v. Indus. Comm'n, 202 Ariz. 518, 521 ¶10, 47 P.3d 1156, 1159 (App. 2002); Johnson
Int'l, Inc. v. City of Phoenix, 192 Ariz. 466, 470-71 ¶26, 967 P.2d 607, 611-12 (App. 1998);
AROK Constr. Co. v. Indian Constr. Servs., 174 Ariz. 291, 297, 848 P.2d 870, 876 (App.
1993).
....
¶19 Ry-Tan also argues that the Arizona School District Procurement Code (the Code), Ariz.
Admin. Code (A.A.C.) R7-2-1001 to R7-2-1195, dramatically altered the landscape of school
procurement contracts and effectively displaced the common law rule of Covington. The state
board of education adopted the Code in 1987 pursuant to legislative authority. A.R.S. § 15213.J (Supp. 2004). By its terms, the Code governs the "expenditure of public monies" for a
school district's procurement of "construction, materials and services." A.A.C. R7-2-1002.A.
¶20 The legislature, of course, can modify or abrogate the common law. To do so, however, it
must express its intent clearly and, "absent a clear manifestation of legislative intent to
abrogate the common law, we interpret statutes with every intendment in favor of consistency
with the common law." Pleak v. Entrada Prop. Owners' Ass'n, 207 Ariz. 418, 422 ¶12, 87
P.3d 831, 835 (2004) (citation omitted).

Examples from Hinojosa v. State, 2009 Ark. 301
....
Hinojosa filed a motion to suppress, contending that his statements and the physical evidence
were illegally seized as a result of an unlawful traffic stop. Sergeant Drown testified at the
suppression hearing that he stopped Hinojosa because the license plate frame on his truck
obscured the identification of the plate's issuing state in violation of Ark. Code Ann. § 27-14716. Hinojosa asserted that the license plate cover did not violate Arkansas or Arizona law,
and that Sergeant Drown's mistake of law rendered the traffic stop without probable cause
and, therefore, illegal. The circuit court denied the motion to suppress in an order issued on
November 5, 2007, and filed a letter containing its findings regarding the suppression motion
the same day. Quoting from Travis v. State, 331 Ark. 7, 959 S.W.2d 32 (1998) and Burris v.
State, 330 Ark. 66, 73, 954 S.W.2d 209, 213 (1997), the trial court stated in the letter of
findings that the supreme court had previously held that a law enforcement officer's mistake
of law does not negate probable cause; instead, "all that is required is that the officer had
probable cause to believe that a traffic violation had occurred." Hinojosa entered a conditional
plea of guilty, reserving his right to appeal the suppression ruling under Ark. R. Crim. P.
24.3(b), and filed a timely notice of appeal.
....
When this court grants a petition for review of a decision by the court of appeals, it reviews
the case as though it had originally been filed with this court. Brookshire v. Adcock, 2009
Ark. 207, 307 S.W.3d 22. In reviewing a circuit court's denial of a motion to suppress
evidence, the appellate court conducts a de novo review based on the totality of the
circumstances, reviewing findings of historical facts for clear error and determining whether
those facts give rise to reasonable suspicion or probable cause, giving due weight to
inferences drawn by the circuit court. Sims v. State, 356 Ark. 507, 157 S.W.3d 530 (2004).
This court will reverse the circuit court only if the ruling is clearly against the preponderance
of the evidence. Id. Additionally, this court defers to the circuit court's superior position to
judge the credibility of witnesses. Id.

Rule 4-2. Contents of briefs.
(a) Contents.
The contents of the brief shall be in the following order:
161

....
(7) Argument. Arguments shall be presented under subheadings numbered to correspond to
the outline of points to be relied upon. For each issue, the applicable standard of review shall
be concisely stated at the beginning of the discussion of the issue. Citations of decisions of the
Arkansas Supreme Court and Court of Appeals must be from the official reports, and all
citations to both official and unofficial reports shall follow the format prescribed in Rule 5-2.
All citations of decisions of any other court must state the style of the case and cite the official
reporter (including a regional reporter so designated by the issuing court) in which the case is
found. If the case is also reported by unofficial publishers, including an unofficial electronic
database, one of these should also be cited. Reference in the argument portion of the parties’
briefs to material found in the abstract and addendum shall be followed by a reference to the
page number of the abstract or addendum at which such material may be found. . . .
Rule 5-2. Opinions.
....
(b) Official Reports.
(1) The Arkansas Reports and the Arkansas Appellate Reports shall contain the official report
of decisions of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals issued before February 14, 2009. The
official report of decisions issued after that date shall be an electronic file created,
authenticated, secured, and maintained by the Reporter of Decisions on the Arkansas
Judiciary website.
(2) After an opinion is announced, the Reporter shall post a preliminary report of the
opinion’s text on the website. This version is subject to editorial corrections. After the
mandate has issued, and any needed editorial corrections are made, the Reporter shall replace
the preliminary report with an authenticated and secure electronic file containing the
permanent and final report of the decision.
(3) Every report of every decision shall contain an official citation created by the Reporter.
This citation shall include the year in which the decision was issued, the abbreviated name of
the issuing court, and the sequential appellate decision number for the year. For example, the
citation White v. Green, 2010 Ark. 171, reflects that the decision was issued in 2010, by the
Arkansas Supreme Court, and was the one hundred seventy-first opinion issued by that court
that calendar year. The citation Roe v. State, 2010 Ark. App. 745, reflects that this decision
was made by the Court of Appeals and was the seven hundred forty-fifth appellate opinion
issued by that court in calendar year 2010.
(c) Precedential Value. Every Supreme Court and Court of Appeals opinion issued after July
1, 2009, is precedent and may be relied upon and cited by any party in any proceeding.
Opinions of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals issued before July 1, 2009, and not
designated for publication shall not be cited, quoted, or referred to by any court or in any
argument, brief, or other materials presented to any court (except in continuing or related
litigation upon an issue such as res judicata, collateral estoppel, or law of the case).
162

(d) Uniform citation.
(1) Decisions included in the Arkansas Reports and Arkansas Appellate Reports shall be cited
in all court papers by referring to the volume and page where the decision can be found and
the year of the decision. Parallel citations to the regional reporter, if available, are required.
Pinpoint citations to specific pages are strongly encouraged. For example:
Smith v. Jones, 338 Ark. 556, 558, 999 S.W.2d 669, 670 (1999).
Doe v. State, 74 Ark. App. 193, 198, 45 S.W.3d 860, 864 (2001).
(2) Published decisions issued between February 14, 2009, and July 1, 2009, and all decisions
issued after July 1, 2009, and available on the Arkansas Judiciary website shall be cited in all
court papers by referring to the case name, the year of the decision, the abbreviated court
name, and the appellate decision number. Arkansas Supreme Court shall be abbreviated
“Ark.” Arkansas Court of Appeals shall be abbreviated “Ark. App.” Parentheticals containing
a date or court abbreviation shall not be used. Parallel citations to the regional reporter, if
available, are required. If the regional reporter citation is not available, then parallel citations
to unofficial sources, including unofficial electronic databases, may be provided. Pinpoint
citations to specific pages are strongly encouraged. A pinpoint citation to the official version
of a decision on the Arkansas Judiciary website shall refer to the page of the electronic file
where the matter cited appears. For example:
Smith v. Hickman, 2009 Ark. 12, at 1, 273 S.W.3d 340, 343.
Doe v. State, 2009 Ark. App. 318, at 7, 2009 WL 240613, at *8.
White v. Green, 2010 Ark. 171, at 3, 2010 WL 3109899, at *2.
Roe v. State, 2010 Ark. App. 745, at 6, 279 S.W.3d 495, 497.
(3) When an unpublished decision may be cited in continuing or related litigation pursuant to
subdivision (c), the opinion’s date determines the citation form. Opinions issued before
February 14, 2009, shall be cited by referring to the case name, the appellate docket number,
the abbreviated name of the issuing court and the complete date of the opinion in the first
parenthetical, and including “unpublished” in a second parenthetical. Opinions issued after
February 14, 2009, and before July 1, 2009, shall be cited by referring to the case name, the
year of the decision, the abbreviated court name, the appellate decision number, and including
“unpublished” in a parenthetical. Parallel citations to unofficial sources, including unofficial
electronic databases, may be provided. For example:
Holt v. Newbern, No. CA07-345, slip op. at 4, 2008 WL 30117, at *2 (Ark. App. Apr. 16,
2008) (unpublished).
Byrd v. Battle, 2009 Ark. App. 114, at 8, 2009 WL 47129, at *6 (unpublished).

Examples from Zuckerman v. Bd. of Chiropractic Exam'rs, 29 Cal. 4th 32, 53
P.3d 119, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d 701 (2002)
....
Under California law, the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners (Board) may discipline any
chiropractor who engages in professional misconduct. A chiropractor accused of misconduct
is entitled to a hearing before an administrative law judge, whose proposed decision is
reviewed by the Board. A chiropractor found to have committed misconduct may be ordered
to pay the "reasonable costs of investigation and prosecution of the case," including attorney
fees, that the Board incurred "up to the date of the hearing . . . ." ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 16, §
317.5.)
....
Hearings are ordinarily held before an administrative law judge employed by the Office of
Administrative Hearings. ( Gov. Code, §§ 11502, 11517.) After a hearing, the administrative
law judge submits a proposed decision to the Board (id., § 11517, subd. (c)), which may adopt
it, reduce the proposed penalty, or, as occurred in this case, reject the proposed decision and
decide the case itself. If the Board chooses the latter option, it may base its decision on the
record of the hearing before the administrative law judge (as occurred here) or it may take
new evidence. (Ibid.) The Board's decisions are subject to judicial review by administrative
mandamus. ( Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5.)
....
Zuckerman argues that regulation 317.5 is facially unconstitutional. He claims it violates his
due process rights by discouraging chiropractors whom the Board has accused of misconduct
from requesting a hearing on the charges. We evaluate the merits of a facial challenge by
considering [*39] "only the text of the measure itself, not its application to the particular
circumstances of an individual." ( Tobe v. City of Santa Ana (1995) 9 Cal. 4th 1069, 1084, [40
Cal. Rptr. 2d 402, 892 P.2d 1145].) A plaintiff challenging the facial validity of a statute
"cannot prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional
problems may possibly arise as to the particular application of the statute." ( Pacific Legal
Foundation v. Brown (1981) 29 Cal.3d 168, 180, [172 Cal. Rptr. 487, 624 P.2d 1215].)
....
Zuckerman also argues that the Board's enabling legislation does not authorize regulation
317.5, and that the regulation therefore exceeds the Board's jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal
summarily rejected the claim, relying on Oranen v. State Board of Chiropractic Examiners
(1999) 77 Cal. App. 4th 258, 261-263 [90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 287], which held that regulation 317.5
is authorized by sections 4 and 10 of the Act. We do not address this issue because it is not
within the scope of our order granting the Board's petition for review.

Examples from Kowalchik v. Brohl, 2012 COA 49
....
¶33 When interpreting a statute, we must consider rules of grammar and common usage,
section 2-4-101, C.R.S. 2011, but we may ignore obvious mistakes, such as in punctuation.
See, e.g., Palmer v. Diaz, 214 P.3d 546, 556 (Colo. App. 2009). From a grammatical and
common usage perspective, application of the phrase "that donates a conservation easement as
an entity" to the list in section 39-22-522(1) is unclear. Therefore, the section is ambiguous.
See People v. Renfro, 117 P.3d 43, 49 (Colo. App. 2004) (where words chosen by legislature
are unclear in their common understanding, or capable of two or more reasonable
constructions leading to different results, statute is ambiguous).
....
¶37 This interpretation is consistent with DOR regulations. See 1 CCR 201-1, Reg. 39-22522(3)(h) (precluding transfer of CE credit to pass-through entity). In matters of statutory
interpretation, "we give great deference to an agency's interpretation of the statute, looking
only to whether the agency's regulation is based on a permissible construction of the statute."

Colo. C.J. Directive 12-01,
http://www.courts.state.co.us/Courts/Supreme_Court/Directives/CJD%201201.pdf
PUBLIC DOMAIN CITATION FORMAT FOR COLORADO SUPREME COURT
AND COLORADO COURT OF APPEALS CASES
Given the increasing amount of legal research being conducted via the internet and other
electronic resources and the desire to promote equal access to Colorado’s system of justice,
this Chief Justice Directive establishes a public domain citation format that will support the
use of Colorado case law in both book and electronic formats.
Legal practitioners and self-represented parties will be permitted—but not required—to use
the public domain citation format instead of citing to the Pacific Reporter. Irrespective of
which citation format is used, a parallel citation to the other format is also not required.
Beginning January 1, 2012, the Clerk of the Colorado Supreme Court and the Clerk of the
Colorado Court of Appeals shall assign to all opinions announced for publication a citation
that shall include:
1

The calendar year in which the opinion is announced;

2
Followed by the court designator “CO” for published opinions announced by the
Colorado Supreme Court, or followed by the court designator “COA” for published
opinions announced by the Court of Appeals; and
3
Followed by a consecutive Arabic numeral, beginning in each new calendar year
with the number “1”; for example: “2012 CO 1” for the first published opinion announced
by the Colorado Supreme Court in 2012, and “2012 COA 1” for the first published opinion
announced by the Colorado Court of Appeals in 2012.
This public domain citation shall appear on the title page of each published opinion
announced by the Supreme Court and by the Court of Appeals. All publishers of Colorado
Supreme Court and Colorado Court of Appeals materials are requested to include this public
domain citation within the heading of each Colorado opinion they publish on or after January
1, 2012. In addition:
Numbered paragraphs. Beginning with the first paragraph of text, each paragraph in every
published opinion shall be numbered consecutively beginning with a “¶” symbol followed by
an Arabic numeral—beginning with the number “1”—flush with the left margin, opposite the
first word of the paragraph. Paragraph numbers shall continue consecutively throughout the
text of the majority opinion and on through any concurrence or dissent. Footnotes and
paragraphs within footnotes shall not be numbered, nor shall markers, captions, headings, or
numerated titles that merely divide sections of opinions. Block-indented, single-spaced
portions of a paragraph shall not be numbered as a separate paragraph. All publishers of
Colorado Supreme Court and Colorado Court of Appeals materials are requested to include
these paragraph numbers in each opinion they publish.
166

Unpublished opinions. Opinions that are not designated for official publication pursuant to
C.A.R. 35(f) shall not be assigned a public domain citation.
Modification, revision, or other substantive amendment. In the case of opinions that are
modified, revised, or otherwise substantively amended by subsequent order of the Supreme
Court or of the Court of Appeals, the public domain citation of the modified, revised, or
amended opinion shall be the same as the original public domain citation but followed by the
letter “M”; for example, “2012 CO 1M” in the case of a modified Colorado Supreme Court
opinion, and “2012 COA 1M” in the case of a modified Colorado Court of Appeals opinion.
In the event an opinion is modified, revised, or otherwise substantively amended more than
once, the public domain citation of any additional modified, revised, or amended opinion shall
be the same as the original public domain citation but designated with the letter “M” followed
by a hyphen and the appropriate Arabic numeral; for example: “2012 CO 1M-2” in the case of
a Colorado Supreme Court opinion modified a second time, and “2012 CO 1M-3” in the case

Examples from Ruffin v. Dep't of Pub. Works, 50 Conn. Supp. 98, 914 A.2d 617
(2006)
....
The failure to place the plaintiff's name on the reemployment list for those laid off and to have
hired her from it cannot be considered in excess of statutory authority because the plaintiff
lost her job due to a disability as opposed to a lack of work. While the plaintiff's position was
not held for her while on her last medical leave of absence, it remained open and she could
have been placed in it if she was able to return to public works' financial management unit.
The position was lost to public works only after the plaintiff's separation from state service. A
layoff is for "any cause other than disability, delinquency, incompetency, misconduct or
neglect of duty . . . ." General Statutes § 5-241(a); Regs., Conn. State Agencies § 5-241-2. A
layoff is a separation from state service by reason of the state's economic situation as opposed
to disability. Sullivan v. Morgan, 160 Conn. 176, 183, 276 A.2d 899 (1970). State employees
who have been laid off, unlike those state employees who are separated from service due to a
disability, are entitled to the placement of their names on the reemployment list for laid off
employees. General Statutes § 5-241; Regs., Conn. State Agencies § 5-241-2. The defendants,
then, acted in compliance with the applicable statutes and regulations.
....
The plaintiff's construction of the State Personnel Act fails to read its provisions as a whole
and is contrary to its terms. The defendants would have acted in excess of their statutory
authority only if they had put the plaintiff's name on the reemployment list for laid off
employees and rehired her from that list because that would have been in violation of the
State Personnel Act. This is factually distinguishable from Cox v. Aiken, 86 Conn. App. 587,
590, 862 A.2d 319 (2004), cert. granted on other grounds, 273 Conn. 916, 871 A.2d 370
(2005), where the plaintiff alleged that the state acted in excess of statutory authority when it
laid off a state employee with less seniority than Cox in violation of § 5-241.

Examples from Johnson v. State, 741 A.2d 1026 (Del. 1999)
....
Superior Court Criminal Rule 7(e) permits an amendment to the indictment at any time before
a verdict "if no additional or different offense is charged and if substantial rights of the
defendant are not prejudiced." In this case, the indictment on the three firearm charges was
amended prior to opening statements to reflect the proper statutory section number. Initially,
the indictment cited to 11 Del. C. § 1447 (possession of a deadly weapon during the
commission of a felony). The indictment was amended to cite to 11 Del. C. § 1447A
(possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony). As originally drafted, the
indictment properly asserted the elements of a charge of possession of a firearm during the
commission of a felony. Because no new, additional or different offense was alleged as a
169

result of the amendment, it was not plain error for the Superior Court to permit amendment of
the indictment to reflect the proper statutory section.

Examples from Dorsey v. District of Columbia, 917 A.2d 639 (D.C. 2007)
....
D.C. Code § 50-2303.03 (b) (2001 & 2006 Supp.) requires that "[a] duplicate of each notice
of infraction shall be served on the person to whom it is issued" and that "[t]he original or a
facsimile thereof shall be filed with the Department [of Motor Vehicles]…." Pursuant to
regulation, a notice of infraction may be issued from a hand-held electronic device. 18 DCMR
§3000.7 (2006). 18 DCMR § 3000.9 (2006), in turn, provides that "[u]ploading of the data
contained in hand-held electronic devices into the automatic ticket database shall be deemed
the filing of a facsimile with the Department . . . ." Mr. Dorsey complains that this regulation
violates the statute because the detailed printout produced by the data base is not an "exact
copy" of the notice of infraction.
....
Many of Mr. Dorsey's complaints are generalized, and we will not consider them because he
has not alleged injury in fact. See generally York Apartments Tenants Ass'n v. District of
Columbia Zoning Comm'n, 856 A.2d 1079, 1084 (D.C. 2004) (discussing the requirements for
standing). The complaint does identify three parking tickets he received, and he does have
standing to complain about them. Yet, so far as the complaint alleges or we could discern
from oral argument, Mr. Dorsey did not appear at a hearing to contest those tickets. Moreover,
he did not move to set aside the default judgments entered against him. He stated that he had
concluded from years of experience that it would be futile to move to vacate those judgments.
....
D.C. Code § 1-301.42 (2001) provides that "[f]or any speech or debate made in the course of
their legislative duties, the members of the Council shall not be questioned in any other
place." Patterned after the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, § 6, cl. 1, this
statute was enacted in part to provide Council members with the same protection afforded to
members of Congress "against civil actions and criminal prosecutions that threaten to delay
and disrupt the legislative process." COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,

Examples from North Lauderdale v. SMM Properties, Inc., 825 So. 2d 343 (Fla.
2002)
....
Pursuant to Florida law, "first response medical aid" is considered one of the routine duties of
a firefighter, and firefighters are required to take 40 hours of training of first response medical
aid. See §§ 401.435(1), 633.35(2), Fla. Stat. (1997); Fla. Admin. Code R. 4A-37.055(21).
First response medical aid is routinely provided by policemen, firefighters, lifeguards, etc., as
necessary "on-scene patient care before emergency medical technicians or paramedics arrive."
§ 401.435(1), Fla. Stat. The duties of the medical response teams in Lake County seem to fit
precisely within the parameters of routine "first response medical aid" because the teams there
had the duty to "stabilize patients and provide them with initial medical care." 695 So. 2d
667-69; see also Water Oak Management Corp. v. Lake County, 673 So. 2d 135 (Fla. 5th
DCA 1996). There was no mention of the provision of comprehensive emergency medical
transportation services as part of the integrated fire protection service discussed in Lake
County.
172

....
Having concluded that the facts of the instant case differ from Lake County, we must
determine whether the special assessment at issue here nonetheless meets the first prong of
the special assessment test; in other words, whether the special assessment for emergency
medical services provides a special benefit to the assessed property. We traditionally defer to
the legislative body's determination of special benefits. See City of Boca Raton v. State, 595
So. 2d 25, 30 (Fla. 1992); South Trail Fire Control Dist. v. State, 273 So. 2d 380, 383 (Fla.
1973) (determination of special benefits is one of fact for legislative body and apportionment
of the assessments is a legislative function). "The standard is the same for both prongs; that is,
the legislative determination as to the existence of special benefits and as to the
apportionment of costs of those benefits should be upheld unless the determination is
arbitrary." Sarasota County v. Sarasota Church of Christ, 667 So. 2d 180, 184 (Fla. 1995).

Examples from Hollingsworth Concrete Prods., Inc., 274 Ga. 210, 553 S.E.2d
270 (2001)
....
Donald Kendrix sought workers' compensation benefits following an accident that occurred
while he was working for Hollingsworth Concrete Products, Inc. The Administrative Law
Judge denied the claim because Kendrix tested positive for marijuana and cocaine after the
accident and failed to rebut the presumption found in O.C.G.A. § 34-9-17 (b) (2) that the
accident was caused by the illegal use of controlled substances. The appellate division
affirmed, as did the superior court. We granted Kendrix's application to appeal to consider
whether O.C.G.A. § 34-9-17 (b) (2) violates equal protection by differentiating between legal
and illegal drug use. Because there is a rational basis for distinguishing between workers who
are injured while taking prescription medication and those who are injured while taking illegal
substances, we affirm.
....
When a controlled substance is given by prescription, the use of that drug is regulated by
several factors that are not present when a drug is taken illegally. A physician determines the
proper dosage and duration the medication should be taken. The doctor also informs the
patient of any limitations on activities that should be observed while on the medication.
Additionally, the regulations governing the pharmacist who fills the prescription provide
another safeguard against misuse of a controlled substance. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 480-1 et
seq.

The presumption in O.C.G.A. § 34-9-17 (b) (2) furthers the state's legitimate goal of reducing

....
On September 10, 1992, Kotis was indicted for (1) murder in the second degree, in violation
of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-701.5(1) (1993), (2) kidnapping, in violation of
HRS § 707-720(1)(e) (1993), and (3) terroristic threatening in the first degree, in violation of
HRS § 707-716(1)(d) (1993). The charges arose from an incident that occurred on or about
September 7, 1992, in which Kotis allegedly threatened his wife, Lynne Kotis, and her
companion, Gregory Wittman, with a knife, restrained Lynne with intent to terrorize her, and
caused Lynne's death while in possession of a firearm.
....
The Department of Health appears to have arrived at the same conclusion, as demonstrated by
HAR § 11-175-45 (1988), the rule promulgated to enforce HRS § 334E-2. That rule provides
in relevant part . . . .
Because Kotis was involuntarily hospitalized by order of the circuit court, HAR § 11-17545(b)(3) applies to his case and authorizes the director's motion for an order of involuntary
medication. Administrative rules, like statutes, have the force and effect of law. State v. Kirn,

Rules were submitted to the Idaho Legislature in 1995 pursuant to I.C. § 67-5291.
....
In an appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the standard of review is the same as
the standard used by the district court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. State v.
Rubbermaid Incorporated, 129 Idaho 353, 355-356, 924 P.2d 615, 617-618 (1996); Thomson
178

v. Idaho Ins. Agency, Inc., 126 Idaho 527, 529, 887 P.2d 1034, 1036 (1994). Upon review, the
Court must liberally construe facts in the existing record in favor of the nonmoving party, and
draw all reasonable inferences from the record in favor of the nonmoving party. Id.; Bonz v.
Sudweeks, 119 Idaho 539, 541, 808 P.2d 876, 878 (1991). Summary judgment is appropriate
if "the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,
show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled
to a judgment as a matter of law." McCoy v. Lyons, 120 Idaho 765, 769, 820 P.2d 360, 364
(1991). If there are conflicting inferences contained in the record or reasonable minds might
reach different conclusions, summary judgment must be denied. Bonz, 119 Idaho at 541, 808
P.2d at 878.
....
The court further justified its incorporation of this case's facts into its analysis by asserting
that I.C. § 67-5278 "contemplates the use of a factual history of a case when determining a
rule's validity." Idaho Code section 67-5278 provides a means by which a party may gain
standing before a district court, prior to exhausting administrative remedies, in order to seek a
declaratory judgment on a rule's validity. The statute requires that the rule itself or its
"threatened application" interfere with or impair, or threaten to interfere with or impair, the
legal rights or privileges of the petitioner. I.C. § 67-5278; Rawson v. Idaho State Bd. Of
Cosmetology, 107 Idaho 1037, 1041, 695 P.2d 422, 426 (Ct.App. 1985).

Examples from Hines v. Dep't of Pub. Aid, 221 Ill. 2d 222, 850 N.E.2d 148 (2006)
....
Following briefing and a hearing, the circuit court entered a detailed order, recounting the
pertinent facts of the case and reviewing the governing law. In the circuit court's view, section
5-13 of the Public Aid Code (305 ILCS 5/5-13 (West 2002)) and 89 Ill. Adm. Code §
102.200, an administrative regulation based on that statute, permitted the Department to seek
reimbursement from Beverly's estate for the Medicaid payments it had made on Julius' behalf.
179

....
Where, as here, the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the court must enforce it
as written. It may not annex new provisions or substitute different ones, or read into the
statute exceptions, limitations, or conditions which the legislature did not express. People ex
rel. Department of Professional Regulation v. Manos, 202 Ill. 2d 563, 568, 782 N.E.2d 237,
270 Ill. Dec. 43 (2002), quoting Bronson v. Washington National Insurance Co., 59 Ill. App.
2d 253, 261-62, 207 N.E.2d 172 (1965). Moreover, as the appellate court correctly observed,
it is a basic principle of statutory construction that "'the enumeration of exceptions in a statute
is construed as an exclusion of all other exceptions.'" 358 Ill. App. 3d at 232, quoting People
ex rel. Sherman v. Cryns, 203 Ill. 2d 264, 286, 786 N.E.2d 139, 271 Ill. Dec. 881 (2003). In
cases such as this, where a statute specifies exceptions to a general rule, no exceptions other
than those designated will be recognized. In re Estate of Tilliski, 390 Ill. 273, 283, 61 N.E.2d
24 (1945). The appellate court was therefore correct to conclude that the Medicaid Act cannot
be construed as permitting the state to look to the estate of a spouse of a recipient of medical
assistance for reimbursement of costs correctly paid on the recipient's behalf.

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Defendant could not be charged under Ind.
Code § 35-43-5-7.1(a)(1) for the acts that the State had alleged. Defendant also filed a motion
to suppress regarding a search warrant, which Defendant contends was illegally obtained. The
trial court rejected both claims and certified its rulings for interlocutory appeal. The Court of
Appeals reversed the trial court's ruling on Defendant's motion to dismiss. See Healthscript,

Reduced to its essentials, this is a case about whether a criminal statute, Ind. Code § 35-43-57.1(a)(1) (Supp. 1997), is sufficiently definite to put Defendant on notice that its alleged
conduct was proscribed.
....
The State alleged that Defendant charged between $ 22.50 and $ 25.00 per 9000 milliliters to
three other customers while charging the Medicaid program $ 181.00 per 9000 milliliters.
According to the State, the resulting payments exceeded $ 50,000. It was the State's theory,
then, that Defendant did not comply with Ind. Admin. Code tit. 405 r. 1-6-21.1(g)(3) when it
overcharged the Medicaid program; that this in turn violated Ind. Code § 12-15-21-1 because
Defendant did not abide by its agreement to "comply with the ... rules governing [Medicaid];"
and Defendant therefore committed a class C felony under the Medicaid Fraud Statute, Ind.
Code § 35-43-5-7.1(a)(1), by submitting a claim in violation of Ind. Code § 12-15.

Examples from Al-Khattat v. Eng'g & Land Surveying Examining Bd., 644
N.W.2d 18 (Iowa 2002)
....
There are two ways to become licensed as a professional engineer in Iowa: (1) licensure by
examination; and (2) licensure by comity. The first method applies to applicants seeking
original licensure as a professional engineer in Iowa. To obtain initial licensure, an applicant
must satisfy each of the following requirements:
a. (1) Graduation from a course in engineering of four years or more in a school or college
which, in the opinion of the board, will properly prepare the applicant for the examination
in fundamental engineering subjects.
....
b. Successfully passing a written, oral, or written and oral examination in fundamental
engineering subjects which is designed to show the knowledge of general engineering
principles. . . . [i.e., the Fundamentals of Engineering examination]
c.. . . [A] specific record of four years or more of practical experience in engineering work
which is of a character satisfactory to the board.
d. Successfully passing a written, oral, or written and oral examination designed to
determine the proficiency and qualifications to engage in the practice of engineering. . . .
[i.e., the Principles and Practice of Engineering examination]
Iowa Code § 542B.14(1). The NCEES prepares the two examinations administered to initial
licensure applicants. Iowa Admin. Code r. 193C--1.4(4) (1997). Both are written, uniform
examinations. Id. The Fundamentals exam "covers general engineering principles," id. r.
193C--1.4(4)(a), and is intended to satisfy the requirements of section 542B.14(1)(b), while
the Principles and Practice exam addresses "proficiency and qualification to engage in the
practice of professional engineering," id. r. 193C--1.4(4)(b), and is intended to satisfy the
requirements of section 542B.14(1)(d).
....
184

Furthermore, the Board has consistently interpreted section 542B.20 to reject comity licensure
where the applicant has not satisfied standards comparable to those required of initial
licensure applicants in Iowa. See Horner v. State Bd. of Eng'g Exam'rs, 253 Iowa 1, 8-9, 110
N.W.2d 371, 375 (1961). No evidence was produced indicating the Board has issued comity
licensure to an applicant who has not taken an examination comparable in design to the
Principles and Practice of Engineering examination.

6.904(2) To legal authorities.
a. Cases. In citing cases, the names of parties must be given. In citing Iowa cases, reference
must be made to the volume and page where the case may be found in the North Western
Reporter. If the case is not reported in the North Western Reporter, reference must be made to
the volume and page where the case may be found in the Iowa Reports. In citing cases,
reference must be made to the court that rendered the opinion and the volume and page where
the opinion may be found in the National Reporter System, if reported therein. E.g., _ N.W.2d

from authorities or referring to a particular point within an authority, the specific page or
pages quoted or relied upon shall be given in addition to the required page references.
b. Iowa Court Rules. When citing the Iowa Court Rules parties shall use the following
references: (1) "Iowa R. Civ. P."; "Iowa R. Crim. P."; "Iowa R. Evid."; "Iowa R. App. P.";
"Iowa R. of Prof’l Conduct"; and "Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct" when citing those rules.
(2) "Iowa Ct. R." when citing all other rules.
c. Unpublished opinions or decisions. An unpublished opinion or decision of a court or
agency may be cited in a brief if the opinion or decision can be readily accessed
electronically. Unpublished opinions or decisions shall not constitute controlling legal
authority. When citing an unpublished opinion or decision a party shall include an electronic
citation indicating where the opinion may be readily accessed online. E.g., No. _______,
______ WL _________, at *___ (____ 20__).
d. Other authorities. When citing other authorities, references shall be made as follows:
(1) Citations to codes shall include the section number and date.
(2) Citations to treatises, textbooks, and encyclopedias shall include the edition, section,
and page.
185

(3) Citations to all other authorities shall include the page or pages.When treatises or
textbooks are cited, the edition must be designated. In citing authorities other than cases,
references shall be made as follows: Codes, to section number; treatises, textbooks and
encyclopedias, to section and page; all others, to page or pages. Use of the “supra” and
“infra” forms of citation is discouraged.
e. Internal cross-references. Use of "supra" and "infra" is not permitted.

Examples from Schmidt v. Kan. State Bd. of Technical Professions, 271 Kan.
206, 21 P.3d 542 (2001)
....
Michael Schmidt, a licensed engineer, appeals the decision of the Shawnee County District
Court affirming an order of the Kansas State Board of Technical Professions (the Board). The
Board determined that certain construction drawings prepared by Schmidt constituted the
practice of architecture as defined by K.S.A. 2000 Supp. 74-7003. The Board further held that
Schmidt, unlicensed to practice architecture, was in violation of the regulations pertaining to
professional conduct established by K.A.R. 66-6-4(e) (1995 Supp.) which regulations prohibit
a licensee from affixing a signature, seal, or both, to a plan dealing with a subject matter
outside the licensee's field of competence. The Board publicly censured Schmidt because he
affixed his engineer's seal to documents dealing with the subject matter of architecture, an
area which it held to be outside his field of competence as established by his education,
training and licensing. The Board also required that he pay costs of $ 5,000, an amount the
Board determined was a portion of the Board's investigative cost, expenses, and attorneys fees
in prosecuting the matter, and an amount equal to the statutory limit.
....
Because the primary issue in this appeal involves the interpretation of statutes and regulations,
the rules of statutory construction set forth in Todd v. Kelly, 251 Kan. 512, 516, 837 P.2d
381(1992), apply. "'"In order to ascertain the legislative intent, courts are not permitted to
consider only a certain isolated part or parts of an act, but are required to consider and
construe together all parts thereof in pari materia."'" Landry v. Graphic Technology, Inc., 268
Kan. 359, 365, 2 P.3d 758 (2000) (quoting Todd, 251 Kan. at 516).
Similarly, when interpreting administrative regulations, the courts generally will defer to an
agency's interpretation of its own regulations. The agency's interpretation will not be
disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. Murphy v. Nelson,
260 Kan. 589, 595, 921 P.2d 1225 (1996). However, the administrative agency may not use
its power to issue regulations which alter the legislative act which is being administered. In re
Tax Appeal of Newton Country Club Co., 12 Kan. App. 2d 638, 647, 753 P.2d 304, rev.

....
Noting that the facts complied with both KRS 342.730(1)(c)1 and 2, the ALJ determined that
the claimant could return immediately to other regular employment at the same or a greater
wage and awarded benefits under KRS 342.730(1)(c)2. Although the Workers' Compensation
Board affirmed on the first two issues and found no error in the corrected order denying
reconsideration, it determined that the evidence and Fawbush v. Gwinn, 103 S.W.3d 5 (Ky.
2003), compelled an award under KRS 342.730(1)(c)1. The Court of Appeals reversed on that
issue but affirmed otherwise.
The claimant raises four arguments. He asserts that 803 KAR 25:010, § 14(2) entitled him to
introduce evidence regarding his social security disability award after proof time closed; that
overwhelming evidence compelled the ALJ to find him totally disabled; that the corrected
order on his petition for reconsideration violated KRS 342.125; and that the ALJ misapplied
Fawbush v. Gwinn, supra, when finding that he could work as a med tech despite ordering the
employer to pay for a walker. Having concluded that nothing required the ALJ to consider
evidence submitted after proof time closed; that substantial evidence supported the finding of
partial disability; that the entry of a corrected order denying consideration did not violate KRS
342.125 or the regulations; and that substantial evidence supported the application of KRS
342.730(1)(c)2, we affirm.

....
La. Adm. Code tit. 76, Part VII, § 343E5 (1995), as adopted by the Wildlife and Fisheries
Commission (Commission) purportedly pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. 56:333A, requires each
mullet permit holder to file information returns monthly during the three-month mullet season
fixed by the Legislature, reporting the number of pounds of mullet taken commercially during
the preceding month and the commercial dealers to whom the mullet were sold. The criminal
charges filed against the forty defendants were apparently based on audits of seafood dealers
and commercial fishermen by enforcement personnel of the Department of Wildlife and
Fisheries (DWF).
....
La. Rev. Stat. 56:6(25)(a), pertaining to all wildlife and fish, authorizes the Commission to
"promulgate rules and regulations, subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedures
Act, to set seasons, times, places, size limits, quotas, daily take, and possession limits, based
upon biological and technical data . . . ."
....
This court, while recognizing that the Louisiana Constitution unequivocally mandates the
separation of powers among the three branches of state government, has traditionally
distinguished in delegation cases between delegation of legislative authority, which
necessarily violates the separation of powers, and delegation of ministerial or administrative
authority, which does not. State v. All Pro Paint and Body Shop, Inc., 93-1316, pp. 6-7 (La.
7/5/94), 639 So. 2d 707, 711. Accordingly, although the Legislature may not delegate primary
legislative power, it may declare its will and, after fixing a primary standard, may confer upon
administrative officers in the executive branch the power to "fill up the details" by prescribing
administrative rules and regulations. Adams v. State Dep't of Health, 458 So. 2d 1295, 1298
(La. 1984). Thus the Legislature may delegate to administrative boards and agencies of the
state the power "to ascertain and determine the facts upon which the laws are to be applied

(b) A parallel public domain citation following the same format as that for post-January 1,
1994 opinions may be added after the Southern Reporter citation, but is not required.
(3) Opinions issued by the Supreme Court of Louisiana prior to the discontinuation of the
official Louisiana Reports in 1972 and opinions issued by the Court of Appeal prior to their
inclusion in the Southern Reporter in 1928 shall be cited in accordance with pre-1994
practice, as follows:
(a) Cite to Louisiana Reports, Louisiana Annual Reports, Robinson, Martin, Reports of the
Louisiana Courts of Appeal, Peltier, Teisser, or McGloin if therein, and to the Southern
Reporter or Southern 2d therein.
(b) A parallel public domain citation following the same format as that for post-January 1,
1994 opinions may be added, but is not required.

2-12.4. Appellant's Brief
Citation of Louisiana cases shall be in conformity with Section VIII of the Louisiana Supreme
Court General Administrative Rules. Citations of other cases shall be to volume and page of
the official reports (and when possible to the unofficial reports). It is recommended that where
United States Supreme Court cases are cited, all three reports be cited, e.g., Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). When a decision from another
state is cited, a copy thereof should be attached to the brief.
The argument on a specification or assignment of error in a brief shall include a suitable
reference by volume and page to the place in the record which contains the basis for the
alleged error. The court may disregard the argument on that error in the event suitable
reference to the record is not made.

Examples from State Comm'n on Human Relations v. Talbot County Det. Ctr.,
370 Md. 115, 803 A.2d 527 (2002)
....
The Maryland Commission on Human Relations ("Commission") is an independent agency
charged with investigating complaints of discrimination in employment, housing and public
accommodations under Article 49B of the Maryland Code and bringing legal and equitable
actions pertaining to those violations. See Md. Code (1957, 1998 Repl. Vol.), Art. 49B, § 10.
....
The Detention Center, in its response dated July 3, 2001, asserted that the Circuit Court
lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Petition for Temporary Injunctive Relief. The
Detention Center further alleged that the Commission's authority to investigate was limited to
the investigative mechanisms set forth in Title 14, Subtitle 3 of the Code of Maryland
Regulations. Specifically, the Detention Center argued that the Commission is only allowed
to: (1) require a fact-finding conference; (2) require the respondent to promptly provide
answers to requests for information; (3) serve interrogatories on a respondent; and (4) issue
subpoenas, if necessary, to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the
production of documents. See COMAR 14.03.01.04. With respect to the latter, the Detention
Center claimed that the use of the word "testimony" indicated that the Commission's
interviews of the witnesses should be formal recorded proceedings, and thus the Commission
had no authority to conduct interviews confidentially and in the absence of a representative
from the Detention Center. 4
....
Maryland's anti-discrimination laws are embodied in Article 49B of the Maryland Code, as is
the Commission's investigatory and enforcement authority with respect to the antidiscrimination legislation. The Commission's comprehensive investigatory powers include the
authority to hold investigatory hearings for fact finding, file civil actions for injunctive relief,
192

receive and issue complaints alleging discrimination, conduct investigations into
discrimination complaints, endeavor to reach conciliation between the parties, and initiate and
pursue litigationto enforce compliance. See Md. Code, Art. 49B, §§ 3, 4, 9A . 10, 11, 12;
Molesworth v. Brandon, 341 Md. 621, 631, 672 A.2d 608, 613 (1996) (citing Weathersby v.
Kentucky Fried Chicken Nat'l Management Co., 86 Md. App. 533, 545, 587 A.2d 569, 574

Publishing Co., 272 Md. 563, 564-65, 325 A.2d 740, 741 (1974). The Commission's
enforcement powers, then, cover the gamut, from investigation to commencement and pursuit
of litigation.
....
Generally, appellate courts review a trial court's determination to grant or deny injunctive
relief for an abuse of discretion because trial courts, sitting as courts of equity, are granted
broad discretionary authority to issue equitable relief. See J. L. Matthews, Inc. v. MarylandNational Capital Park & Planning Comm., 368 Md. 71, 93, 792 A.2d 288, 301 (2002). See El
Bey v. Moorish Sci. Temple of Am., 362 Md. 339, 354-55, 765 A.2d 132, 140 (2001)(stating
that while normally a trial court's decision to grant or deny injunctive relief is reviewed for an
abuse of discretion, "no such deference [is given] when we find 'an obvious error in the
application of the principles of equity'") (quoting Western Md. Dairy, Inc. v. Chenowith, 180

Examples from City Council of Agawam v. Energy Facilities Siting Bd., 437
Mass. 821, 776 N.E.2d 1002 (2002)
....
Pursuant to its statutory mission to "provide a reliable energy supply for the commonwealth
with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost," G. L. c. 164, § 69H,
the board is charged with issuing construction permits for energy generation facilities. G. L. c.
164, § 69J 1/4, inserted by St. 1997, c. 164, § 210. On June 20, 1995, Berkshire filed a
petition to construct, requesting such a permit from the board.
....
The board's regulations regarding the issuance of certificates divide the certificate application
process into two parts: an initial petition, 980 Code Mass. Regs. § 6.02 (1993); and an
application, 980 Code Mass. Regs. § 6.03 (1993). When an energy generating company files
an initial petition for a certificate, the board may either grant the initial petition (and proceed
to consider the subsequent application) or consolidate that petition with the application and
consider them both in a combined hearing. 980 Code Mass. Regs. § 6.02 (4). The board in this
case chose the latter course.
....
The scope of our review of board decisions is limited to determining whether they conform to
the Massachusetts and Federal Constitutions, the provisions of §§ 69H-69O, and the board's
rules and regulations; whether they are supported by substantial evidence in the record of the
board's proceedings; and whether they were arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of the Board's
discretion. G. L. c. 164, § 69P. See Andover v. Energy Facilities Siting Bd., 435 Mass. 377,
378-379, 758 N.E.2d 117 (2001). The party appealing from a decision of the board bears the

Examples from Huggett v. Dep't of Natural Resources, 464 Mich. 711, 629
N.W.2d 915 (2001)
....
This case requires us to decide whether plaintiffs' proposed activities to build and operate a
commercial cranberry farm in a wetland is exempt from the statutory wetland permit
requirements, MCL 324.30304, because it is a farming activity that is not subject to the permit
requirements under the farming activities exemption provided by MCL 324.30305(2)(e). We
conclude that the farming activities exemption is not so broad that it encompasses plaintiffs'
proposal. Also, the proposed cranberry farm does not fall within the production and
harvesting draining exemption to the wetland permit requirements, MCL 324.30305(2)(j), or
the existing farming exemption to the requirements, MCL 324.30305(3), that we ordered the
parties to address. Therefore, plaintiffs must obtain a wetland permit to proceed with the
proposed cranberry farm. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
....
When a statute uses a general term followed by specific examples included within the general
term, as the farming activities exemption does, the canon of statutory construction ejusdem
generis applies. See Belanger v Warren Bd of Ed, 432 Mich 575, 583; 443 NW2d 372 (1989).
This canon gives effect to both the general and specific terms by "treating the particular words
as indicating the class, and the general words as extending the provisions of the statute to
everything embraced in that class, though not specifically named by the particular words." Id.,
quoting 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), § 47.17, p 166. In light of the
195

specific terms, the general term is restricted to include only things of the same kind, class,
character, or nature as those specifically enumerated. See Sands Appliance Servs, Inc v
Wilson, 463 Mich 231, 242; 615 NW2d 241 (2000).
....
We note that plaintiffs' land is adjacent to Lake 16. However, the trial court did not make a
finding whether the land is "contiguous" to Lake 16 as that term is used in § 30305(2)(j),
which is defined in administrative rules promulgated by the Department of Natural Resources.
See 1999 AC, R 281.921; see also MCL 324.30319(1) (directing the DNR to promulgate rules
to enforce part 303). Therefore, we do not consider whether plaintiffs' land could fall into the
exception to the draining exemption.

I. Citation of Authority
A. Citation of Cases
1. Initial Citation.
The first time a case is cited in an opinion, either in the body of the text or in a footnote,
cite in full the official reporter of its jurisdiction (where available), and include the parallel
citation of the regional reporter.
Mayberry v Pryor, 422 Mich 579; 374 NW2d 683 (1985).
If a case is first cited in an order, either in the body of the text or in a footnote, cite the
official report only.
Mayberry v Pryor, 422 Mich 579 (1985).
Where an official citation is not yet available, provide blanks for the volume and page
numbers.
Mayberry v Pryor, _____ Mich ____; 374 NW2d 683 (1985).
2. Subsequent Citation.
a. Once cited in full in the text, a case need not be cited again in full in the text or a
footnote. Subsequent reference in the text or in a footnote may use any of the following
shortened forms:

196

E.g., Mayberry; Mayberry, supra; Mayberry v Pryor. (N.B.: "Id." may be used as a
subsequent reference only if no other authority intervenes between the previous citation
of the same source and "id.")
b. Where a case is cited in full in a footnote, a subsequent short-form citation may be used
in a subsequent footnote to refer the reader to the full citation:
Mayberry, n 4 supra.
3. Point or "jump" citation.
a. To refer to an internal page of an opinion, cite the official reporter where available:
1) initial citation: include the "jump" page in the complete citation:
Mayberry v Pryor, 422 Mich 579, 587; 374 NW2d 683 (1985); or
2) subsequent citation: append the "jump" page to any short-form citation:
Mayberry, supra, p 587; Mayberry, supra at 587; Mayberry, p 587; id., p 587; id. at 587;
422 Mich 587.
(N.B.: The form of the short-form citation must be consistent throughout an opinion. Do
not mix Mayberry, supra, p 587, with Mayberry, supra at 587.)
b. If the official report of a case is not yet available, refer to the "jump" page in an
unofficial report:
1) initial citation: Galster v Woods (On Rehearing), 173 Cal App 3d 529, ____; 219 Cal
Rptr 500, 509 (1985);
2) subsequent citation: Galster, supra, 219 Cal Rptr 509; or id., 219 Cal Rptr 509; or 219
Cal Rptr 509 (N.B.: it is mandatory in this situation that the identity of the unofficial
reporter be shown because references to pages not otherwise identified are presumed to
be to the official reporter.)
4. Case names.
a. Italicizing. Names of cases should be italicized both in the text of an opinion and in
footnotes. Underscoring no longer should be used to indicate italics.
b. Official sources. Cite the name of a case as set forth on the first page of the official
reporter as fully as necessary for recognition. Do not show et al., et ux., or like references
to other parties in a case name, but do show ex rel (for on the Relation of or for the use and
benefit of) and the relator's name.

Examples from Breza v. City of Minnetrista, 725 N.W.2d 106 (Minn. 2006)
....
Breza sought a writ of mandamus from the district court. The district court found that Breza
"applied for an exemption for the 5,757 square feet that had been filled," n6 and that the city
took more than one year to respond to the application. The court held that Breza's request was
approved by operation of law under Minn. Stat. § 15.99, and issued a writ of mandamus
compelling the city to approve his exemption request. The city appealed to the Minnesota
Court of Appeals, which reversed. Breza v. City of Minnetrista, 706 N.W.2d 512, 519 (Minn.
App. 2005). That court held that because the city did not have the authority to grant an
exemption for more than 400 square feet, the city had fully satisfied its official duties and a
writ of mandamus was therefore not appropriate. Id. at 518-519.
....
Breza brought this action seeking a writ of mandamus. To be entitled to mandamus relief,
Breza must show that: 1) the city "failed to perform an official duty clearly imposed by law";
2) he "suffered a public wrong" and was specifically injured by the city's failure; and 3) he has
"no other adequate legal remedy." See N. States Power Co. v. Minn. Metro. Council, 684
N.W.2d 485, 491 (Minn. 2004). The district court's decision to issue the writ was based on the
determination that Breza's application was approved by operation of law. When a decision on
a writ of mandamus is based solely on a legal determination, we review that decision de novo.
See Castor v. City of Minneapolis, 429 N.W.2d 244, 245 (Minn. 1988).
....
Finally, the legislature has defined ten specific types of activites for which an exemption from
the no-filling-without-replacement prohibition can be approved. Local government units
(LGUs) like the city have the authority to grant exemptions. Minn. R. 8420.0210 (1999)
("Local government units may offer exemption certificates as part of the wetland program in
their jurisdiction.").

....
¶ 9. Nichols argues that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him to the maximum
sentence authorized by Miss. Code Ann. § 97-17-33. In addition, he claims that the trial judge
relied upon incorrect information that he was guilty of prior felony convictions. Further,
Nichols asserts that the excessive and disproportionate sentence was a violation of the Eighth
Amendment of the United States Constitution which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.
¶ 10. "Sentencing is within the complete discretion of the trial court and not subject to
appellate review if it is within the limits prescribed by statute." Wall v. State, 718 So. 2d 1107,

exceed the maximum term allowed by the statute cannot be disturbed on appeal. However,
this Court will review a sentence that allegedly imposed a penalty that is disproportionate to
the crime. Id.

Examples from State ex rel. Sunshine Enters. of Mo., Inc. v. Bd. of Adjustment,
64 S.W.3d 310 (Mo. 2002)
....
The city denied Sunshine a merchant's license, based on the zoning district of the address. See
sec. 94.270 RSMo 2000. Sunshine appealed to the Board, for approval or a variance. After the
appeal was filed, but before the hearing, the city passed Ordinance 2074, amending the
"definitions" in the zoning code.
....
Under-$ 500 lending has the same or similar characteristics as personal services and financial
institutions. Sections 400.370.B, D, H. Short-term consumer loans are similar to a personal
service, as indicated by the exclusion of pawn shops and check cashing establishments.
Section 400.370.B. Under-$ 500 lenders - like banks, savings and loan associations, and credit
unions - offer unsecured loans to consumers. See secs. 362.105, 369.144(15), 369.229,
369.695.1, 370.070(2), 370.300, 370.310 RSMo 2000; 4 CSR 140-20.046 (2001). Thus, under$ 500 lending is a permitted use. Sections 400.370.B, D, H.

The city claims that, even if permitted by section 400.370, Sunshine is excluded by Ordinance
2074. The city views Ordinance 2074 as a land use "zoning" regulation. See secs. 89.010-040
RSMo 2000. Zoning ordinances are presumptively within the police power. Flora Realty and
Inv. Co. v. City of Ladue, 362 Mo. 1025, 246 S.W.2d 771, 778 (Mo. banc 1952); State ex rel.
Helujon, Ltd. v. Jefferson County, 964 S.W.2d 531, 536 (Mo. App. 1998). This Court has long
held that ordinances that are regulatory, but not prohibitory, do not conflict with state law.

Examples from Briese v. Mont. Pub. Emples. Ret. Bd., 2012 MT 192, 366 Mont.
148, 285 P.3d 550
....
¶ 14 Mootness is a threshold issue which must be resolved before addressing the underlying
dispute. Med. Marijuana Growers Ass'n v. Corrigan, 2012 MT 146, ¶ 18, 365 Mont. 346, 281
P.3d 210 (citing Povsha v. City of Billings, 2007 MT 353, ¶ 19, 340 Mont. 346, 174 P.3d
515). The mootness doctrine is one of several doctrines designed to limit the judicial power of
this Court to justiciable controversies—that is, controversies "upon which a court's judgment
will effectively operate, as distinguished from . . . dispute[s] invoking a purely political,
administrative, philosophical, or academic conclusion." Progressive Direct Ins. Co. v.
Stuivenga, 2012 MT 75, ¶ 16, 364 Mont. 390, 276 P.3d 867. The fundamental question to be
answered in any review of possible mootness is "whether it is possible to grant some form of
effective relief to the appellant." Stuivenga, ¶ 37.
¶ 15 MPERB claims that it is impossible to grant effective relief to Erene because, once the
payments commenced, MPERB had fully discharged its obligations under the law. MPERB
cites § 19-2-803, MCA, in support of its position.
....
¶ 18 When denying Erene's initial claim for benefits in 2008, MPERA did not inform her of
her right to challenge the denial by appeal to MPERB. Under Admin. R. M. 2.43.1501(2)
(2003), Erene had the right to appeal MPERA's decision to MPERB. MPERA, in two separate
letters to Erene dated May 30, 2008, (1) stated that MPERA was "require[d]" to honor the
2006 change of beneficiaries, and (2) informed Erene that she "must complete, have notarized
and return to this office" the claim forms for the children before being provided with the
payment options that were available. It gave no indication that further review was available by
appeal to MPERB under Admin. R. M. 2.43.1501(2) at that time. As a matter of due process,
MPERA was obligated to inform Erene of any right to appeal and the procedures for seeking
such appeal. See Pickens v. Shelton-Thompson, 2000 MT 131, ¶ 13, ¶ 15, 300 Mont. 16, 3

Mont. Sup. Ct. Internal Op. Rules, § VII,
http://courts.mt.gov/content/library/docs/cite_cases.pdf.
(1) At the time of issuance, this Court shall assign to all opinions and to those orders
designated by this Court for publication (hereinafter referred to as substantive orders), a
citation which shall include the calendar year in which the opinion or substantive order is
issued followed by the Montana U.S. Postal Code (MT) followed by a consecutive number
beginning each year with "1" (for example, 1998 MT 1). This citation shall be known as the
public domain or neutral-format citation and shall appear on the title page of each opinion and
on the first page of each substantive order issued by this Court. State Reporter Publishing
Company and West Group are requested to publish this public domain, neutral-format citation
within the heading of each opinion or substantive order published by those companies.
(2) Beginning with the first paragraph of text, each paragraph in every such opinion and
substantive order shall be numbered consecutively beginning with a ¶ symbol followed by an
Arabic numeral, flush with the left margin, opposite the first word of the paragraph. Paragraph
numbers shall continue consecutively throughout the text of the majority opinion or
substantive order and any concurring or dissenting opinions or rationale. Paragraphs within
footnotes shall not be numbered nor shall markers, captions, headings or Roman numerals
which merely divide opinions or sections thereof. Block-indented single-spaced portions of a
paragraph shall not be numbered as a separate paragraph. State Reporter Publishing Company
and West Group are requested to publish these paragraph numbers in each opinion or
substantive order published by those companies.
(3) In the case of opinions which are not to be cited as precedent (variously referred to as
unpublished, "noncite," or memorandum opinions) and in the case of all substantive orders
(unless otherwise specifically designated by this Court), the consecutive number in the public
domain or neutral-format citation shall be followed by the letter "N" to indicate that the
opinion or substantive order is not to be cited as precedent in any brief, motion or document
filed with this Court or elsewhere (for example, 1998 MT 1N). Any "N" citation,
nevertheless, shall be listed along with the result, case title and Supreme Court cause number
in the quarterly table of noncitable cases issued by this Court and published by State Reporter
Publishing Company and West Group.
(4) In the case of opinions or substantive orders which are withdrawn or vacated by a
subsequent order of this Court, the public domain, neutral-format citation of the withdrawing
or vacating order shall be the same as the original public domain, neutral-format citation but
followed by a letter "W" (for example, 1998 MT 1W). An opinion or substantive order issued
in place of one withdrawn or vacated shall be assigned the next consecutive number
appropriate to the date on which it is issued.
(5) In the case of opinions or substantive orders which are amended by a subsequent order of
this Court, the public domain, neutral-format citation of the amending order shall be the same
202

as the original public domain, neutral-format citation but followed by a letter "A" (for
example, 1998 MT 1A). Amended paragraphs shall contain the same number as the paragraph
being amended. Additional paragraphs shall contain the same number as the immediately
preceding original paragraph but with the addition of a lower case letter (for example, if two
new paragraphs are added following paragraph 13 of the original opinion, the new paragraphs
will be numbered ¶ 13a and ¶ 13b). If a paragraph is deleted, the number of the deleted
paragraph shall be skipped in the sequence of paragraph numbering in any subsequently
published version of the amended opinion or substantive order, provided that at the point
where the paragraph was deleted, there shall be a note indicating the deletion of that
paragraph.
(6)The following are examples of citations to Montana Supreme Court opinions:

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the citation formats adopted herein are in addition to and
supplement the current citation formats used by this Court. The Montana Reports is the
official reporter of this Court's opinions and this Court will continue to cite to both its official
reporter and to the regional, Pacific, reporter in addition to the public domain, neutral-format
citation. This Court encourages the adoption and use of these formats in all briefs, memoranda
and other documents filed in this Court.
Mont. Sup.Ct. Order of Jan. 22, 2009
Pursuant to its authority under Article VII, Section 2(3) of the Constitution of the State of
Montana, this Court filed an order on December 16, 1997, adopting citation formats for use in
its opinions, including a public domain or neutral-format citation. The Court has now
determined to simplify the format set forth in that order for pinpoint citations to opinions
decided after January 1, 1998, by eliminating the requirement that paragraph number(s) be
repeated for all three sources cited.

203

THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that, effective immediately, proper pinpoint citations to
opinions decided by this Court after January 1, 1998, shall be in the form shown in the
following example:
Doe v. Roe, 1998 MT 12, ¶¶ 44-45, 286 Mont. 175, 989 P.2d 1312
In all other respects, the Court’s order filed December 16, 1997, shall remain unchanged.

Examples from Bethesda Found. v. Neb. Dep't of Soc. Serv., 243 Neb. 130, 498
N.W.2d 86 (1993)
....
The Nebraska Department of Social Services is responsible for the administration of the
medicaid program pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. § 68-1018 et seq. (Reissue 1990). In
administering the program, the department reimburses medicaid-certified nursing home
facilities for the cost of care to medicaid-eligible patients. The department determines
payment or reimbursement rates for a nursing home based on allowable costs incurred by the
facility. Payment for long-term-care services is set forth in 471 Neb. Admin. Code, § 12-011
et seq. (1987). Rates paid to long-term-care providers must be "reasonable and adequate to
meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities to
provide services in conformance with state and federal laws, regulations, and quality and
safety standards." 471 Neb. Admin. Code § 12-011.02.
....
Since October 17, 1977, the Nebraska medicaid program has recognized depreciation as an
allowable cost. The regulations also provide for the recapture of depreciation upon the sale
of a long-term-care facility for a profit. Depreciation in 471 NAC 12-011.08D refers to real
property only. A long term care facility which is sold for a profit and has received NMAP
payments for depreciation, shall refund to the Department the lower of - 1. The amount of
depreciation allowed and paid by the Department between July 1, 1976, and the time of
sale of the property; or 2. The product of the ratio of depreciation paid by the Department
since July 1, 1976, to the total depreciation accumulated by the facility (adjusted to total
allowable depreciation under the straight-line method, if any other method has been used)
times the difference in the sale price of the property over the book value of the assets sold. .
..
471 Neb. Admin. Code § 12-011.08D.
....
This court has previously determined that the department's change in its depreciation
recapture regulation did not have a retroactive effect and therefore could not violate a
204

provider's right to due process. See H.H.N.H., Inc. v. Department of Soc. Servs., 234 Neb.
363, 451 N.W.2d 374 (1990). Bethesda is not entitled to conclude that its depreciation
reimbursement was not subject to being recaptured upon the sale of its facilities, and it did not
have a constitutionally protected property right in those reimbursements.

(4) Every reference to a reported case shall set forth the title thereof, the volume and page
where found, the tribunal deciding the case, and the year decided. If the cited opinion is long,
it shall also refer to the page where the pertinent portion of the opinion is found. Nebraska
cases shall be cited by the Nebraska Reports and/or Nebraska Appellate Reports, but may
include citation to such other reports as may contain such cases.
(5) If a current statute is relied upon, it must be cited from the last published revision or
compilation of the statutes, or supplement thereto, if contained therein; if not contained
therein, to the session laws wherein contained, or the legislative bill as enacted.
(6) Citations to textbooks, encyclopedias, and other works shall give the title, edition, year of
publication, volume number, section, and page where found.

Examples from Nev. Tax Comm'n v. Nev. Cement Co., 36 P.3d 418 (Nev. 2001)
....
In contrast to a retail sale, items that are sold for resale are tax exempt. These items are
purchased for the purpose of being resold. More specifically, no sales tax applies to property
purchased for resale in the regular course of business. This sale-for-resale exemption from the
sales tax is found under the definition of "retail sale" in NRS 372.050, which provides that a
retail sale is "a sale for any purpose other than resale in the regular course of business of
tangible personal property."
205

....
Our decision finds support in the Department's tax regulation pertaining to property used in
manufacturing. We have previously stated that the interpretation by the agency charged with
administering a statute is persuasive, and that great deference should be given to that
interpretation if it is within the language of the statute. See Collins Discount Liquors v. State
of Nevada, 106 Nev. 766, 768, 802 P.2d 4, 5 (1990); Nevada Power Co. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n, 102 Nev. 1, 4, 711 P.2d 867, 869 (1986). NAC 372.370(1) states that a tax applies to
the sale of tangible personal property purchased "for the purpose of use in manufacturing,
producing, or processing tangible personal property and not for the purpose of physically
incorporating it into the manufactured article to be sold." Subsection (2) of that regulation
states that a tax does not apply to the sale of tangible personal property purchased "for the
purpose of incorporating it into the manufactured article to be sold." NAC 372.370 focuses on
the purpose for which property is purchased. The requirement that the purpose be "primary" is
implicit. NAC 372.370 is therefore consistent with NRS 372.050, and sets forth a primarypurpose test.
....
Nev. Sup. Ct. R. 123
RULE 123. Citation to unpublished opinions and orders
An unpublished opinion or order of the Nevada Supreme Court shall not be regarded as
precedent and shall not be cited as legal authority except when the opinion or order is (1)
relevant under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata or collateral estoppel; (2) relevant
to a criminal or disciplinary proceeding because it affects the same defendant or respondent in
another such proceeding; or (3) relevant to an analysis of whether recommended discipline is
consistent with previous discipline orders appearing in the state bar publication.

Examples from State v. Caswell, 146 N.H. 243, 769 A.2d 387 (2001)
....
We next consider the defendant's argument that the trial court erred by admitting Sergeant
Bourque's testimony to establish that the Intoxilyzer was properly certified and operating
properly at the time of the test. RSA 265:85 (Supp. 2000) provides that "no tests of . . . breath
authorized by RSA 265:84, IV shall be considered as evidence in any proceeding before any .
. . court unless such test is performed in accordance with methods prescribed by the
commissioner of the department of health and human services." These rules are codified in
New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules, Part He-P 2207, and became effective April 1,
1996. As a result, we review the evidence presented at trial in accordance with these rules.
206

....
Rule He-P 2207.05 (a) provides that "the forensic breath testing supervisor II shall conduct a
preventive maintenance check on each approved instrument 6 months after the initial check
and at 6 month intervals." This rule further states that the "the forensic breath testing
supervisor II shall certify the accuracy of the approved instrument by signing and dating the
preventive maintenance check form, pursuant to RSA 265:90, II." N.H. Admin. Rules, He-P
2207.05 (d). It is incumbent upon the State to establish that the breath test has been conducted
in accordance with the rules, including the successful completion of the required preventive
maintenance check and the certification of the Intoxilyzer's accuracy. See RSA 265:85, IV
(Supp. 2000).
....
There are no administrative rules or statutes governing the admissibility of radar evidence. It
is a "fundamental principle that the results of scientific tests are inadmissible unless there is
proof that the test device was operating accurately and that the test was performed by
qualified individuals." State v. Ahern, 122 N.H. 744, 745, 449 A.2d 1224 (1982). "This
imposes a responsibility upon the proponent seeking admission of such evidence to establish
the prima facie reliability of any test results." State v. Lee, 134 N.H. 392, 395, 593 A.2d 235
(1991).

(9) All references in a brief or memorandum of law to the appendix or to the record must be
accompanied by the appropriate page number.
Citations to Supreme Court of the United States cases that cannot be made to the official
United States Reports or to the Supreme Court Reporter shall include the month, day, and
year of decision or a reference to United States Law Week. Citations to other federal decisions
not presently reported shall identify the court, docket number, and date.
Citations to the decisions of this court may be to the New Hampshire Reports only. Citations
to other State court decisions may either be: (a) to the official report and to the West Reporter
system, with the year of decision; or (b) to the West Reporter only, in which case the citation
should identify the State court by name or level, and should mention the year of decision.

A.2d 53 (2002)
....
This is a second round Mount Laurel exclusionary zoning case brought by Toll Brothers, Inc.
(Toll Brothers) against the Township of West Windsor, the Township Committee of the
Township of West Windsor, and the Planning Board of the Township of West Windsor
(collectively "West Windsor" or the "Township"). Toll Brothers, the owner of a 293 acre tract
of land located in West Windsor, alleged below that the Township had engaged in
exclusionary zoning in violation of the New Jersey Constitution and the Fair Housing Act of
New Jersey (FHA), N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 to -329, and sought a builder's remedy from the trial
court.

Under N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.15(d)1 to -5.15(d)2, COAH outlines its bonus credit system for rental
units. For every one rental unit made available to the general public, COAH grants the
municipality two units of credit, id. at -5.15(d)1; age-restricted rental units produce 1.33 units
of credit. Id. at -5.15(d)2.
....
Our analysis of these issues entails a two-tiered inquiry, each subject to a separate and distinct
standard of review. The determination whether market demand should be considered in
assessing whether a municipality's zoning ordinances are exclusionary is a question of law
that we review de novo. Balsamides v. Protameen Chem., Inc., 160 N.J. 352, 372, 734 A.2d
721 (1999) (stating that "matters of law are subject to a de novo review"). We give deference
to the trial court's factual findings, e.g., that West Windsor's sewer requirements are cost
generative, as such findings should not be disturbed "when supported by adequate, substantial
and credible evidence." Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., 65 N.J. 474,

140 N.M. 440, 143 P.3d 478
....
{20} Agencies are created by statute, and limited to the power and authority expressly granted
or necessarily implied by those statutes. PNM Elec. Servs. v. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1998NMSC-17, ¶ 10, 125 N.M. 302, 961 P.2d 147. Statutory interpretation is a question of law
which we review de novo. Pub. Serv. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 1999-NMSC-40, ¶ 14, 128
N.M. 309, 992 P.2d 860. "Because statutory construction is outside the realm of the
Commission's expertise, we afford little, if any, deference to the Commission on this matter."
Id. (citation omitted). Our primary concern is to determine and give effect to legislative intent,
looking first to the plain language of the statute. Id. ¶ 18. We hold that the New Mexico
Telecommunications Act and the AFOR plan and order authorize the PRC's credit or refund
incentive.
....
{27} Qwest argues that there are statutory limits to the PRC's enforcement authority. The PRC
"may apply to the district court for injunctions to prevent violations of any provision of the
New Mexico Telecommunications Act . . . or of any rule or order of the [PRC] issued
pursuant to that act," Section 63-9A-20, and "impose an administrative fine on a
telecommunications provider for any act or omission that the provider knew or should have
known was a violation of any applicable law or rule or order of the [PRC]," NMSA 1978, §
63-7-23(B) (2000). Qwest argues that the PRC is limited to these two mechanisms to enforce
Qwest's compliance. We refuse to so limit the PRC's regulatory authority. The Legislature has
given the PRC the discretion "to enforce [its] orders by appropriate administrative action and
court proceedings." Section 8-8-4(B)(5) (emphasis added). Since the Legislature has
implicitly authorized that the PRC create and enforce this incentive on Qwest, the incentive is
an appropriate administrative action. We find that these statutes provide the PRC additional
avenues to prevent violations of the New Mexico Telecommunications Act.
....
{50} Section 8-8-4(B)(10) allows the PRC to adopt "reasonable administrative, regulatory and
procedural rules" to carry out its duties. Pursuant to this legislative directive, the PRC has
passed rules to conduct hearings. A non-party is afforded the opportunity to comment on the
record, "but such statement shall not be considered by the [PRC] as evidence." NMAC
17.1.2.26(F) (2001). Regulations also allow a non-original party to intervene in a proceeding,
NMAC 17.1.2.26(A), and if the intervention motion is granted, the entity has the same rights
as original parties, NMAC 17.1.2.26(D)(7). Such rights include submitting proposed findings
and conclusions, orders, and briefs. NMAC 17.1.2.38.

23-112. Citations for pleadings and other papers.
A. Applicability. This rule governs the form of citations included in pleadings and papers
filed in the courts of this state.
B. State appellate court citations. For citation to opinions of the New Mexico Supreme Court
and New Mexico Court of Appeals, use of the vendor neutral citation with citation to both
reporters is required. For citations for opinions issued prior to January 1, 1996, that do not
have a vendor neutral citation, follow citation rules in The Bluebook: A Uniform System of
Citation.
C. Subsequent history. Subsequent history, when cited, shall include the vendor neutral
citation for certiorari information, as assigned by the Supreme Court. When a vendor neutral
citation number is not available, the Supreme Court docket number shall be substituted for the
vendor neutral citation..
D. Pinpoint citations. If a pinpoint citation is used:
(1) for opinions issued after 1996 that have a paragraph number, the paragraph number shall
be used after the vendor neutral citation.
(2) for opinions issued prior to 1997 or if paragraph numbering is unavailable, the applicable
page number of the New Mexico Reports and Pacific Reporter print publication shall be used.
E. Citation to New Mexico statutes. Citations to the New Mexico statutes shall be to the
chapter, article and section of the 1978 compilation of the New Mexico Statutes Annotated
(NMSA).
F. Citation to court rules and uniform jury instructions. Citation to the rules, uniform jury
instructions and forms promulgated or approved by the Supreme Court shall be to the New
Mexico Rules Annotated (NMRA) version by set and rule number. You may also use the
citation form approved by the Supreme Court and published in the NMRA. For example, Rule
4A-100 NMRA provides that rules published in set number 4A of the NMRA may be cited as
"Domestic Relations Form 4A-___. If the rule has been amended since the date the
proceedings were filed, it may be necessary to refer to the year of the version of the rule relied

Examples from Aliessa v. Novello, 96 N.Y.2d 418, 754 N.E.2d 1085, 730 N.Y.S.2d
1 (2001)
....
Plaintiffs brought a class action in Supreme Court seeking a declaration that Social Services
Law § 122 violates article XVII, sections 1 and 3 of the New York State Constitution and the
Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New York State Constitutions. The putative
class consists of "all Lawful Permanent Residents who entered the United States on or after
September 22, 1996 and all [PRUCOLs] who, but for the operation of New York Social
Services Law § 122, would be eligible for Medicaid coverage in New York State." The State
moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, for which plaintiffs crossmoved. Deferring its decision on class certification, Supreme Court denied the State's motion
and granted in part plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, declaring that section 122 of the
Social Services Law violates article XVII, § 1 of the New York State Constitution and the
Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions. (Aliessa v
Whalen, 181 Misc 2d 334.)
Three days later, the Appellate Division decided Alvarino v Wing (261 AD2d 255). In that
case, resident aliens argued that Social Services Law § 95 unconstitutionally denied them
food assistance. The court held that because the State enacted the statute in direct response to
a Federal supplemental appropriations bill (Pub L 105-18), the challenged classification
should be evaluated, for equal protection purposes, under a rational basis standard rather than
the strict scrutiny standard Supreme Court had employed.
....
If a State wants to extend Medicaid benefits to others, it is free to proceed at its own expense.
New York has done so. It has provided non-federally subsidized Medicaid benefits to certain
categories of individuals, including residents between the ages of 21 and 65 whose income
and resources fall below a statutory "standard of need" and who are not otherwise entitled to
federally subsidized Medicaid (see, Social Services Law § 366 [1]; 18 NYCRR 360-3.3 [b]).
Thus, New York State's Medicaid system has two components: one that is federally
subsidized and one that the State funds entirely on its own.
....
The State argues that the allocation scheme here does not contravene Tucker. It contends that
the Constitution affords it discretion to set levels of benefits for the needy and, in the exercise
of that discretion, it has provided plaintiffs full safety net assistance and emergency medical
treatment. We agree that article XVII, § 1 affords the State wide discretion in defining who is
needy and in setting benefit levels. Indeed, in Matter of Barie v Lavine (40 NY2d 565, 566),
this Court upheld a regulation that required welfare recipients to participate in a work referral
program and denied them benefits for 30 days if they failed to comply.
....
212

In this context, plaintiffs and amici argue that when such patients are treated in emergency
settings, the hospitals are not permitted to release them without a discharge plan for necessary
continuing health care services, citing Public Health Law § 2803 (1) (g). Because they cannot
be readily discharged, many remain in hospital facilities. Those who are discharged
experience a cycle of emergency, recovery, stabilization, deterioration and the onset of
another emergency. All of this, plaintiffs and amici contend, could be avoided through
ongoing medical treatment.

Examples from Craig v. County of Chatham, 356 N.C. 40, 565 S.E.2d 172 (2002)
....
The enactment and operation of a general, statewide law does not necessarily prevent a county
from regulating in the same field. However, preemption issues arise when it is shown that the
legislature intended to implement statewide regulation in the area, to the exclusion of local
regulation. See N.C.G.S. § 160A-174(b) (5) (2001). "'Municipal by-laws and ordinances must
be in harmony with the general laws of the State, and whenever they come in conflict with the
general laws, the by-laws and ordinances must give way.'" State v. Williams, 283 N.C. 550,
552, 196 S.E.2d 756, 757 (1973) (quoting Town of Washington v. Hammond, 76 N.C. 33, 36.
(1877)). The law of preemption is grounded in the need to avoid dual regulation. See, e.g.,
283 N.C. at 554, 196 S.E.2d at 759.
....
Turning now to the Health Board Rules enacted by the Chatham County Board of Health, we
note that they contain more stringent rules than those established in the EMC regulations.
However, N.C.G.S. § 130A-39 specifically grants local boards of health the power to enact
213

rules which are more strict when they are "required to protect the public health." N.C.G.S. §
130A-39(b). In an effort to protect the environment, the EMC has created a system of
permitting and inspection which regulates waste management systems on farms, including
swine farms of more than 250 swine. See 15A NCAC 2H .0217(a) (1) (A) (Sept. 2001).
....
In holding that the Swine Ordinance and the Health Board Rules were preempted by state law,
the Court of Appeals reasoned that the Chatham County Board of Commissioners and the
Chatham County Board of Health sought to regulate an area in which the General Assembly
had provided a "complete and integrated regulatory scheme" of swine farm regulations. Craig
v. County of Chatham, 143 N.C. App. 30, 545 S.E.2d 455 (2001); see also N.C.G.S. § 160A174(b) (5). We concur in this assessment.

Examples from Zarrett v. Zarrett, 1998 ND 49, 574 N.W.2d 855
....
[¶8] A trial court has continuing power to modify an earlier child support order. E.g., Steffes
v. Steffes, 1997 ND 49, ¶14, 560 N.W.2d 888; Eklund v. Eklund, 538 N.W.2d 182, 185 (N.D.
1995). Child support orders are given only "limited finality," resulting in an exception to the
rule of claim preclusion. Eklund, 538 N.W.2d at 185. Thus, res judicata ordinarily will not
prevent reexamination of a child support order, and, if the motion to modify support comes
more than one year after the earlier order, N.D.C.C. § 14-09-08.4(3) "directs the court to
modify it to meet the guidelines." Eklund, 538 N.W.2d at 186; see also Nelson, 547 N.W.2d at
744. The statutory scheme clearly envisions periodic reviews of child support orders to ensure
support is at all times consistent with the current guidelines amount. See N.D.C.C. § 14-0908.4. The trial court erred in applying the doctrine of res judicata in this case.
214

....
[¶12] Robert asserts that, even if the stipulation is unenforceable, the court could have
nevertheless reached the same result by treating the $33,000 college payments as a "continued
or fixed expense" over which he had no control under N.D.A.C. § 75-02-04.1-09(2)(j),
thereby rebutting the presumptively correct amount under the guidelines. The trial court made
no specific finding the presumptively correct amount had been rebutted, as required by the
guidelines. See, e.g., In re L.D.C., 1997 ND 104, ¶8, 564 N.W.2d 298. Furthermore, deviation
from the guidelines amount is appropriate only if the court first finds by a preponderance of
the evidence that a deviation "is in the best interest of the supported children." N.D.A.C. § 7502-04.1-09(2). There is no evidence in this record, nor a finding by the court, that it is in
Diana and David's best interest to allow Robert to pay less than the guidelines amount for
their support.

Ohio 46, 131 Ohio St. 3d 111, 961 N.E.2d 178
....
{¶2} "Because the final OP & F board decision is not appealable, mandamus is available to
correct an abuse of discretion by the board in denying disability benefits." State ex rel.
Tindira v. Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund, 130 Ohio St.3d 62, 2011 Ohio 4677, 955 N.E.2d
963, ¶ 28. A clear legal right to the requested relief in mandamus exists "where the board
abuses its discretion by entering an order which is not supported by 'some evidence.'" Kinsey
v. Bd. of Trustees of Police & Firemen's Disability & Pension Fund of Ohio, 49 Ohio St.3d
224, 225, 551 N.E.2d 989 (1990).
{¶3} In November 2009, the board of trustees upheld its previous decision denying
Kolcinko's application for disability-retirement benefits. Kolcinko claimed entitlement to an
award of benefits under R.C. 742.38(D)(1), which provides, "A member of the fund who is
permanently and totally disabled as the result of the performance of the member's official
duties as a member of a police or fire department shall be paid annual disability benefits in
accordance with division (A) of section 742.39 of the Revised Code." "'Totally disabled'
means a member of the fund is unable to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for
which the member is reasonably fitted by training, experience, and accomplishments," and
"'[p]ermanently disabled' means a condition of disability from which there is no present
indication of recovery." R.C. 742.38(D)(1)(a) and (b).
....
{¶7} Under R.C. 742.38 and Ohio Adm.Code 742-3-05, the OP & F board is vested with the
exclusive authority to evaluate the weight and credibility of the medical evidence in
determining a member's entitlement to disability-retirement benefits. Notwithstanding Dr.
Poa's and Dr. Resnick's conclusion that Kolcinko was permanently disabled, they further
noted that Dr. Francis McCafferty had observed that Kolcinko complained of "certain patterns
or combinations of features that are unusual or atypical in clinical populations but relatively
common among individuals feigning mental disorder." Dr. Poa and Dr. Resnick opined that
Kolcinko had a lower whole-person impairment (12 percent) than the 15 percent figure
determined by Dr. Smarty.

Examples from Okla. Pub. Employees Ass'n v. Okla. Dep't of Cent. Servs., 2002
OK 71, 55 P.3d 1072
....
¶6 The trial court granted summary judgment against Central Services and DHS. Summary
judgment is an adjudication on the merits of the controversy. Union Oil Co. of California v.
Board of Equalization of Beckham County, 1996 OK 40, 913 P.2d 1330, 1333. It is
appropriate "where there is no dispute as to the material facts or as to the inferences to be
drawn from undisputed facts, and the law favors the movant's claim or liability-defeating
defense." Harkrider v. Posey, 2000 OK 94, ¶8, 24 P.3d 821, 824 - 825. When the facts are not
in dispute a plaintiff's standing may adjudicated on a motion for summary judgment. Beville v.
Curry, 2001 OK 1, ¶9, 39 P.3d 754, 758; Herring v. State ex rel. Oklahoma Tax Commission,
1995 OK 28, 894 P.2d 1074, 1076. No facts are in dispute relevant to the standing of the
OPEA.
....
¶15 DHS and Central Services further argue that the non-OPEA-members as individuals lack
standing to bring the suit. The individuals are family members, guardians, or parents of
residents at Greer Center. First, we note that "The voluntary placement of a child in an
institution for the mentally retarded by the child's parents shall not, by itself, abrogate the
rights and authority of the parents." 10 O.S. 1991 § 1415(A). Further, in facilities operated by
the Department of Human Services all residents of institutions for the mentally retarded "who
are eighteen (18) years of age or older shall have a guardian appointed by a court." Id. at §
1415(B). However, in some cases after an assessment is performed the appointment of a
guardian is not warranted and a guardian is not appointed. Id. at § 1415(C). DHS does not
challenge the status of the parents and guardians as proper representatives of the residents of
Greer.
....
¶24 DHS argues that it possesses the constitutional authority to formulate specific policies on
how it will perform those duties assigned to it by the Legislature and the People. DHS relies
upon Okla. Const. Art. 25 § 4. It points to the constitutional language stating that: "The
Commission shall formulate the policies, and adopt rules and regulations for the effective
administration of the duties of the Department." The constitutional power to formulate
policies resides in the Commission for Human Services and not the Department of Human
Services. The Commission may exercise a legislative power to formulate a policy while the
Director of the Department exercises executive and administrative duties imposed upon the
Department. Okla. Const. Art. 25 § 4. The Oklahoma Administrative Code (O.A.C.) states
that "The Commission is responsible for formulating Department Policies and adopting rules
and regulations for the effective administration of programs under the jurisdiction of the
Department." O.A.C. 340:1-1-3(b) (1996). In summary, the Legislature and the People define
219

the duties of the Department, Okla. Const. Art. 25 § 1, the Department carries out those
duties, Okla. Const. Art. 25 § 1, the Commission creates policies and rules for the Department
to carry out the duties of the Department, Okla. Const. Art. 25 § 4, and the Director possesses
executive and administrative power to implement the policies and rules created by the
Commission.
....
¶25 DHS argues that Art. 25 § 4 vests DHS (or the Commission) with legislative power apart
from the Legislature or the people, and that this power includes the ability to perform certain
acts not granted by the Legislature. The policies, rules, and regulations for DHS are for the
administration of the duties of the Department. We said in City of Sand Springs v. Department
of Public Welfare, 1980 OK 36, 608 P.2d 1139, "This mandatory constitutional requirement
that the Commission formulate policies for the effective administration of its duties is
indicative of a constitutional mandate from the people to the Commission to legislate when
necessary to accomplish effectively the duties imposed upon the body." Id. 608 P.2d 1146.
Public officials and agencies possess those powers granted by law, by constitution or statute,
and those officials and agencies cannot expand those powers by their own authority. See
Marley v. Cannon, 1980 OK 147, 618 P.2d 401, where we said that an "agency created by
statute may only exercise those powers granted by statute and cannot expand those powers by
its own authority." Id. 618 P.2d at 405. The duties of the Department are not created by DHS,
but by the People and the Legislature, Okla. Const. Art. 25 § 1, and implemented in
accordance with the rules of the Commission, Okla. Const. Art. 25 § 4.

opinions of that court.
Prior to January 1, 1998 citation to opinions of the Oklahoma Supreme Court and Court of
Civil Appeals shall include citations to Pacific and Pacific 2d Reporters. Citation to the
Supreme Court's paragraph citation is allowed as a parallel cite, but not required. Effective
January 1, 1998, Citation to opinions of the Oklahoma Supreme Court shall be as follows:
1. Oklahoma Supreme Court Opinions Promulgated Prior to May 1, 1997. Opinions
promulgated (filed) prior to May 1, 1997 shall be cited by reference to the Pacific and Pacific
2nd Reporters. Parallel citation to the Supreme Court's official paragraph citation form is
strongly encouraged for opinions promulgated prior to May 1, 1997. Parallel citation to
Oklahoma Reports is allowed. However, parallel citation to Oklahoma Reports shall not be
made when the Supreme Court's official paragraph citation form is used.
Examples of permissible citation form for opinions prior to May 1, 1997:
Skinner v. Braum's Ice Cream Store, 1995 OK 11, 890 P.2d 922.
Skinner v. Braum's Ice Cream Store, 1995 OK 11, ¶9, 890 P.2d 922.

In "Skinner v. Braum's Ice Cream Store, 1995 OK 11, ¶9, 890 P.2d 922" "1995" refers to the
year the opinion was promulgated, "OK" is the court designation for the Oklahoma Supreme
Court, "11" is the number of the opinion in 1995 assigned to that opinion by the Oklahoma
221

Supreme Court, " ¶9" is paragraph number 9 of the opinion as designated by the Supreme
Court, and "890 P.2d 922" is the parallel citation to Pacific 2d Reporter.
2. Oklahoma Supreme Court Opinions Promulgated After May 1, 1997. Opinions
promulgated (filed) after May 1, 1997 shall be cited by reference to the Supreme Court's
official paragraph citation form. Parallel citation to Pacific 2nd and subsequent Pacific
Reporters is REQUIRED. The parallel cite to Pacific 2d Reporter may include a cite to the
specific page of that Reporter if a specific paragraph is cited. When the Supreme Court
paragraph citation form is used citation to a footnote need not include the paragraph number
where the note occurs in the opinion.
Examples of citation form for post-May 1, 1997 opinions using a pre-May 1, 1997 opinion:
Skinner v. Braum's Ice Cream Store, 1995 OK 11, 890 P.2d 922.
Skinner v. Braum's Ice Cream Store, 1995 OK 11, ¶9, 890 P.2d 922.

Skinner v. Braum's Ice Cream Store, 1995 OK 11, n. 10, 890 P.2d 922.
An opinion cited subsequent to issuance of the mandate therein but prior to official
publication shall be cited using the following as an example: Wilkinson v. Dean Witter
Reynolds, Inc., 1997 OK 20, P.2d , (mandate issued April 3, 1997).
In a matter where no mandate issues an opinion may be cited prior to official publication
when the time to file a petition for rehearing has lapsed and no petition for rehearing was
filed. The following is an example: Edwards v. Basel Pharmaceuticals, 1997 OK 22, P.2d ,
(petition for rehearing not filed).
3. Opinions of the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals. Published opinions of the Oklahoma
Court of Civil Appeals promulgated after May 1, 1997 shall be cited by reference to the
Supreme Court's official paragraph citation form. Parallel citation to Pacific 2nd Reporters is
required. Published opinions prior to May 1, 1997 shall be cited using the Pacific Reporter 2d,
and parallel citation to the paragraph citation form is strongly encouraged. Opinions of the
Court of Civil Appeals, no matter when published, are subject to the other provisions of Rule
1.200.
4. Citation to Opinions Supported by Less Than a Majority. The paragraph citation form is
also used to designate material in a published opinion where that opinion is supported by less
than a majority of the members of the Supreme Court. When material from such an opinion is
cited the name of the author, names of any Justices joining the opinion, and the type of
opinion MUST be designated in the cite. For example, to cite paragraph number nine of the
dissenting opinion in Edwards v. Basel Pharmaceuticals, 1997 OK 22, P.2d . The correct
citation form is: Edwards v. Basel Pharmaceuticals, 1997 OK 22, ¶9, P.2d , (Opala, J.,
dissenting in part). A footnote of this dissenting opinion is cited thus: Edwards v. Basel
Pharmaceuticals, 1997 OK 22, n.12, P.2d , (Opala, J., dissenting in part). A published
opinion, or part thereof, of the Supreme Court has no precedential effect unless a majority of
the Court have joined therein.

C. Argument and Citation of Authorities.
(1) Both parties must provide a brief argument, exhibiting a clear statement of the point of law
or fact to be discussed, with a reference to the pages of the record filed and the authorities
relied upon in support of each point raised.
(2) Citation to opinions of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals shall include citations to
Pacific, Pacific 2nd, and Pacific 3rd Reporters. Citation to the Court’s official paragraph
citation form is allowed as a parallel cite, but not required. Effective January 1, 1998, citation
to opinions of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals shall be as follows:
(a) Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals Opinions in which mandate has issued prior to
January 1, 1954, shall include citations to Pacific and Pacific 2nd Reporters. Parallel
citation to Oklahoma Criminal Reports is strongly encouraged. Examples of permissible
citation form include:
(i) Hunter v. State, 97 Okl.Cr. 402, 264 P.2d 997 (1953).
(ii) Hunter v. State, 97 Okl.Cr. 402, 264 P.2d 997, 998 (1953).
(iii) Hunter v. State, 97 Okl.Cr. 402, 403, 264 P.2d 997, 998 (1953).
(iv) Hunter v. State, 264 P.2d 997 (Okl.Cr.1953).

(b) Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals Opinions in which mandate has issued after
January 1, 1954, shall include citations to Pacific, Pacific 2nd, and Pacific 3rd Reporters.
Parallel citation to the official paragraph citation form of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal
Appeals is strongly encouraged. Examples of permissible citation form include:
(i) Burns v. State, 1955 OK CR 46, 282 P.2d 258.
(ii) Burns v. State, 1955 OK CR 46, 282 P.2d 258, 259.

(v) Burns v. State, 282 P.2d 258, 259 (Okl.Cr.1955).
In "Burns v. State, 1955 OK CR 46, ¶9, 282 P.2d 258", "1955" refers to the year the
mandate issued, "OK CR" is the court designation for the Oklahoma Court of Criminal
Appeals, "46" is the number of that 1955 opinion assigned by the Court, "¶9" is
223

paragraph number 9 of the opinion as designated by the Court, and "282 P.2d 258" is the
parallel citation to the Pacific 2nd reporter.
(c) An opinion cited subsequent to issuance of the mandate but prior to official publication
shall include citation to the Oklahoma Bar Journal. Parallel citation to the official
paragraph citation form of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals is strongly
encouraged. Examples of permissible citation form include:

not be cited as authority in a subsequent appellate opinion nor used as authority by a trial
court until the mandate in the matter has issued. After the mandate has issued, the opinion
as published on the Web site shall constitute the official paragraph citation form of the
Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. See Rule 1.0 (D) for citation to Rules.
(3) In all instances, an unpublished opinion is not binding on this Court. However, parties
may cite and bring to the Court’s attention the unpublished opinions of this Court provided
counsel states that no published case would serve as well the purpose for which counsel cites
it, and provided further that counsel shall provide opposing counsel and the Court with a copy
of the unpublished opinion.
(4) Citation to opinions of the United States Supreme Court shall include each of the
following: U.S., S.Ct., L.Ed. (year).
(5) Citation to Oklahoma Uniform Jury Instructions - Criminal (Second) shall be as follows:
Instruction No. ____, OUJI-CR(2d); and citation to revised instructions shall be noted with
the addition of (Supp. _____) (Year).
(6) Failure to present relevant authority in compliance with these requirements will result in
the issue being forfeited on appeal. See Stafford v. State, 800 P.2d 738 , 741 (Okl.Cr.1990);
Walton v. State, 744 P.2d 977 , 979 (Okl.Cr.1987); S.R.S. v. State, 728 P.2d 515 , 518

Examples from Coats v. State, 334 Or. 587, 54 P.3d 610 (2002)
224

....
The Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) had promulgated administrative rules
construing ORS 279.350(1) to apply to all workers at the "site of work." See OAR 839-0160004(19). Plaintiff and ODOT agreed to incorporate those rules as terms of their contract. As
explained below, central to the parties' contract dispute in this case are two subsections of a
BOLI rule that identified the circumstances under which rock quarries, or so-called "borrow
pits," would be considered part of the "site of work."
....
The state moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, citing Alto v.
State Fire Marshall, 319 Or 382, 876 P2d 774 (1994), for the proposition that a circuit court
lacks jurisdiction to review the validity of agency rules in the context of a declaratory
judgment action. While that motion was pending, ODOT withheld payments on the contract.
Plaintiff then filed an amended complaint in which he alleged that he had complied with the
terms of the contract, including the prevailing wage rules, and that ODOT's decision to
withhold payments was a breach of the parties' contract. In addition, because ODOT's
decision was based on a determination that plaintiff had failed to comply with the prevailing
wage rules, plaintiff argued that the circuit court had acquired subject matter jurisdiction to
review the validity of those rules under this court's decision in Hay v. Oregon Dep't of
Transportation, 301 Or 129, 719 P2d 860 (1986). ODOT counterclaimed for breach of
contract, and both parties then moved for summary judgment.

Examples from Commonwealth v. Beam, 567 Pa. 492, 788 A.2d 357 (2002)
....
Following a hearing, the common pleas court denied the request for preliminary injunction
and, on Beam's motion, granted summary judgment in his favor and dismissed the
Department's complaint. The Department appealed, and the Commonwealth Court affirmed.
See Commonwealth, Dep't of Transp. v. Beam, 756 A.2d 1179 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2000). In their
reasoning, the reviewing courts focused on the Department's capacity to seek injunctive relief
in a judicial forum. While recognizing that the Department's enumerated powers included the
authority to issue airport licenses, see 74 Pa.C.S. § 5301(b)(1), and that its regulations
establish procedures for license revocation and suspension, see 67 Pa. Code § 471.3(g), the
courts nevertheless found no statute or regulation conferring authority to commence a civil
action. Stressing the precept that an agency charged with the administration of a statute can
act only within the strict confines of that statute, and therefore can seek to enforce compliance
only with specific legislative authorization, the Commonwealth Court and the common pleas
court concluded that the Department bore airport licensing enforcement responsibility but
presently lacked the means by which to compel compliance. See 756 A.2d at 1181-82. We
allowed appeal to consider this conclusion.
....
This Court has long adhered to the precept that the power and authority exercised by
administrative agencies must be conferred by legislative language that is clear and
unmistakable. See United Artists' Theater Circuit, Inc. v. City of Phila., 535 Pa. 370, 389, 635
A.2d 612, 622 (1993) ("A doubtful power does not exist." (citations omitted));
Commonwealth, Dep't of Envtl. Resources v. Butler County Mushroom Farm, 499 Pa. 509,
513, 454 A.2d 1, 3 (1982). At the same time, we recognize that the General Assembly has
prescribed that legislative enactments are generally to be construed in such a manner as to
effect their objects and promote justice, see 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(c), and, in assessing a statute,
courts are directed to consider the consequences of a particular interpretation, as well as other
226

factors enumerated in the Statutory Construction Act. See Butler County Mushroom Farm,
499 Pa. at 516-17, 454 A.2d at 5-6 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a))(observing that "statutory
construction is not an exercise to be undertaken without considerations of practicality, precept
and experience[, "as ignoring such considerations may result in a forced and narrow
interpretation that does not comport with legislative intent). Based upon such considerations,
the rule requiring express legislative delegation is tempered by the recognition that an
administrative agency is invested with the implied authority necessary to the effectuation of
its express mandates. See Butler County Mushroom Farm, 499 Pa. at 513, 454 A.2d at 4;
Pennsylvania Human Relations Com. v. St. Joe Minerals Corp., Zinc Smelting Div., 476 Pa.
302, 310, 382 A.2d 731, 736; Day v. Public Service Comm'n (Yellow Cab Co.), 312 Pa. 381,

(b) Citations of authorities.
Citations of authorities must set forth the principle for which they are cited. Citations of
uncodified statutes shall make reference to the book and page of the Laws of Pennsylvania
(Pamphlet Laws) or other official edition, and also to a standard digest, where the statutes
may be found. Citations of provisions of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes may be in
the form: “1 Pa.C.S. § 1928 (rule of strict and liberal construction)” and the official
codifications of other jurisdictions may be cited similarly. Quotations from authorities or
statutes shall also set forth the pages from which they are taken. Opinions of an appellate
court of this or another jurisdiction shall be cited from the National Reporter System, if
published therein, and to the official reports of Pennsylvania appellate courts, if published
therein.

Examples from Cullen v. Town Council of Lincoln, 893 A.2d 239 (R.I. 2006)
....
There can be no doubt that the town's ability to adopt ordinances that govern the construction
and regulation of a public sewer system is both provided for by law, P.L. 1984, ch. 270, and
falls squarely within the municipal police power, see Mill Realty Associates v. Crowe, 841
A.2d 668, 674 (R.I. 2004) ("maintaining a public water supply and requiring that builders
construct extensions to the town's public water system falls squarely within [a municipality's]
police power"); Munroe v. Town of East Greenwich, 733 A.2d 703, 710 (R.I. 1999) ("zoning,
land development and subdivision regulations constitute a valid exercise of [a municipality's]
police power"). Proper exercise of this police power is accomplished exclusively by enacting
227

municipal ordinances; however, a town council has discretion to impose requirements
additional to an ordinance when provided for in the ordinance itself.
....
We think that this case does not warrant excepting petitioners from the ordinary requirement
that they make at least one meaningful application to a state agency before seeking a remedy
in the courts by pleading futility. First, the council was presented with evidence that DEM
might not be so quick to deny petitioners' application. In addition, petitioners' self-serving
conclusion that traversing designated wetlands would present as grave a danger as their
proposed pump station route is ultimately only meaningless speculation since DEM is the
agency vested with the exclusive power to make precisely this determination. See generally
G.L. 1956 §§ 2-1-18 through 2-1-24. Furthermore, while DEM's regulations may require it to
deny a particular tie-in route if an alternate is available which does not traverse a designated
area, see Rules and Regulations Governing the Administration and Enforcement of the
Freshwater Wetlands Act, Department of Environmental Management, 12 Code R.I. Reg.
190-25-9.05(E)(2)(b) (2001), it is unclear what DEM would do if the pump station route is no
longer available due to the council's denial of petitioners' application.

Examples from Johnson v. Collins Entm't Co., 349 S.C. 613, 564 S.E.2d 653
(2002)
....
The defendants argue plaintiffs cannot rely on S.C. Code Ann. § 12-21-2804(B) as a
"predicate act" for their RICO claim because in Video Gaming Consultants, Inc. v. South
Carolina Dep't of Revenue, 342 S.C. 34, 535 S.E.2d 642 (2000), this Court declared all of
section 12-21-2804(B) unconstitutional. We disagree. In Video Gaming, we limited our
holding to the first clause of section 12-21-2804(B).

"When the issue is the constitutionality of a statute, every presumption will be made in favor
of its validity and no statute will be declared unconstitutional unless its invalidity appears so
clearly as to leave no doubt that it conflicts with the constitution." State v. Jones, 344 S.C. 48,
58, 543 S.E.2d 541, 546 (2001) (citations omitted). This general presumption of validity can
be overcome only by a clear showing the act violates some provision of the constitution. Main
v. Thomason, 342 S.C. 79, 535 S.E.2d 918 (2000); State v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 451 S.E.2d
888 (1994); see also Westvaco Corp. v. South Carolina Dep't of Revenue, 321 S.C. 59, 467
S.E.2d 739 (1995).
....
The Court of Appeals correctly ruled on this issue in Justice v. Pantry, 330 S.C. 37, 496
S.E.2d 871 (Ct. App. 1998), aff'd as modified, 335 S.C. 572, 518 S.E.2d 40 (1999).
....
Furthermore, although the statute itself does not define "special inducement," the regulations
of DOR do clarify the term. 27 S.C. Code Reg. 117-190.1 provides:
Any attempt to influence a person to play video game machines is an inducement and is
strictly prohibited by the statute. A location will be subject to the various civil or criminal
penalties imposed by the statute for offering any of the following inducements . . . .

Examples from Baker v. Atkinson, 2001 SD 49, 625 N.W.2d 265
....
[¶18] The county commission and Frawley did not dispute that these statutes create a legal
duty to act. The dispute centered on the form of the petition. The county commission and
Frawley argue that if the form of the petition does not meet the requirements set forth by
statute, then no duty arises under either SDCL 7-18A-16 or 7-18A-15.1. With this in mind,
and since the issue of a legal duty to act is not in dispute, this Court need only determine the
petition's validity. This Court is cognizant that SDCL 2-1-11 requires that initiative and
referendum petitions "shall be liberally construed, so that the real intention of the petitioners
may not be defeated by a mere technicality." For this reason "we begin with a presumption
that petitions which are circulated, signed, and filed are valid." Larson v. Hazeltine, 1996 S.D.
100, ¶19, 552 N.W.2d 830, 835 (citations omitted).
....
[¶20] The form of a referendum petition is set forth in SDCL ch 2-1 and SDAR ch 5:02:08.
More specifically, SDCL 7-18A-17 and SDAR 5:02:08.19 govern the form of the petition.
SDCL 7-18A-17 provides:
If the matter intended to be covered by a referendum petition is the whole of any ordinance
or resolution, the petition shall contain the title of such ordinance or the subject of such
resolution, and the date of its passage, but if only a portion of such ordinance or resolution
is intended to be covered by the petition, such portion shall be set out at length.

Examples from In re T.K.Y., 205 S.W.3d 343 (Tenn. 2006)
....
Without making any reference to the statutory definition of "legal parent" in Tennessee Code
Annotated section 36-1-113, the Court of Appeals determined that Mr. Y. was the legal father
of T.K.Y. Relying on its decision in State ex rel. Cihlar v. Crawford, 39 S.W.3d 172 (Tenn.
Ct. App. 2000), the Court of Appeals held that because Mr. Y. and Mr. P. both satisfied the
presumptions in the paternity statute, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-2-304(a), the question of legal
parenthood was to be determined using a best-interests-type analysis, considering "the
existence of a family unit, the stability of the family environment, sources of the child's
support, the child's relationship with the presumptive father(s), and the child's physical,
mental and emotional needs." See Cihlar, 39 S.W.3d at 185. However, as we have explained,
that analysis omitted the critical step of recognizing that, pursuant to the statutory scheme,
Mr. P. is not merely the biological father but he is also the legal father. Therefore, his parental
rights may only be terminated pursuant to the statute, and a best-interests analysis is relevant
if and only if termination is appropriate. Unless and until grounds for termination of Mr. P.'s
rights have been proven, he is the legal father of T.K.Y.

The decision to award retroactive child support lies within the discretion of the juvenile court.
State ex rel Coleman v. Clay, 805 S.W.2d 752, 755 (Tenn. 1991). However, the trial court's
discretion is cabined by the statutory requirement that it must presumptively apply the Child
Support Guidelines. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-101(e)(1)(A) (2005). The trial court's discretion
is further limited by Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-2-311(a)(11)(A) (2005), which
236

states a presumption that child support "shall be awarded retroactively to the date of the
child's birth." See also Child Support Guidelines, Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-2-4-.06.

Examples from Gilbert v. El Paso County Hosp. Dist., 38 S.W.3d 85 (Tex. 2001)
....
The Texas Constitution and the Texas Tax Code contain truth-in-taxation provisions that
require local government units to tell their taxpayers each year how the next year's property
tax rates will compare with the current year's. See TEX. CONST. art. VIII, § 21; TEX. TAX
CODE § 26.04. As part of this taxpayer notice, taxing units must show how much money, if
any, they estimate that they will have left over from previous years' maintenance and
operations and debt service funds. See TEX. TAX CODE § 26.04(e)(2). We must decide
whether this disclosure requirement covers only property taxes left over in these funds, or
whether it also covers revenues accumulated from other sources.
....

237

The El Paso Hospital District operates R.E. Thomason General Hospital in El Paso.
Constitutionally and by statute, the District has "full responsibility for furnishing medical and
hospital care for indigent and needy persons residing in the district." TEX. HEALTH &
SAFETY CODE § 281.046; see also TEX. CONST. art. IX, § 4. To discharge this
responsibility and to perform its other functions, the District is authorized to assess a tax on
property in the District. See TEX. CONST. art. IX, § 4. In addition to property taxes, the
District receives money from paying patients, its cafeteria, and Medicaid.
The District participates in the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Program, which provides
extra revenue to hospitals that serve a high proportion of indigent patients. See 1 TEX.
ADMIN. CODE § 355.8065(a). This revenue is significant to the District; in 1997, the
District received almost as much in Disproportionate Share ("Dispro") Funds as it received in
property taxes. n1 The District must use Dispro revenues to serve poor patients, but the parties
agree that this requirement is the only relevant limit on the District's use of Dispro money.
....
The Tax Code authorizes the taxing unit to adopt a rate for each fiscal year that is high
enough to pay its debts and to meet its maintenance and operation needs. See id. § 26.05(a).
Depending on the unit's debts, service plans, and accumulated surplus or deficit, this rate may
be lower than, higher than, or equal to the previous year's rate. See Texas Co. v. Panhandle
Indep. Sch. Dist., 72 S.W.2d 957, 959 (Tex. Civ. App.--Amarillo 1934, writ ref'd) (holding
overall tax levy, within statutory limits, to be a discretionary matter for the taxing authority).
If the unit wishes to adopt a rate higher than either the effective tax rate or the rollback tax
rate, however, the taxing unit must hold a public hearing before adopting it. See TEX. TAX
CODE § 26.05(d). Moreover, in a special election after the taxing unit has adopted the annual
tax rate, voters can cut taxes back to the rollback tax rate, perhaps forcing the taxing unit to
alter its plans. See id. § 26.07; Vinson v. Burgess, 773 S.W.2d 263 (Tex. 1989).

While there is no required citation form statewide, one Texas appellate court requires citation

Examples from Menzies v. Galetka, 2006 UT 81, 150 P.3d 480
....
¶19 . . . The current regulations contain a tiered system for the payment of attorney fees,
which compensates counsel according to the procedural stage of the post-conviction
proceedings reached. See Utah Admin. Code r. 25-14-4. Under this system, the maximum
238

amount of compensation an attorney may receive for representing a petitioner in a postconviction death penalty case is $ 37,500. Id. Under these rules, the Division of Finance will
also "pay reasonable litigation expenses not to exceed a total of $ 20,000 in any one case for
court-approved investigators, expert witnesses, and consultants." Utah Admin. Code r. 25-145.
....
¶48 On April 22, 2004, Menzies filed a notice of appeal with the district court indicating that
he would seek review of the court's denial of 60(b) relief as well as the order regarding the
destruction of the inadmissible documents. Menzies' appeal is now before this court. We have
jurisdiction pursuant to Utah Code Ann. § 78-2-2(3)(i) (2002).
....
¶65 The first question we must consider is whether Menzies' 60(b) motion was timely. A
motion under 60(b) must "be made within a reasonable time and for reason[] (1) . . . not more
than 3 months after the judgment . . . was entered." Utah R. Civ. P. 60(b). In cases where
subsection (b)(1) applies, a movant may not attempt to circumvent the three-month filing
period by relying on another subsection. Russell v. Martell, 681 P.2d 1193, 1195 (Utah 1984);
Laub v. S. Cent. Utah Tel. Ass'n., 657 P.2d 1304, 1308 (Utah 1982); Richins v. Delbert
Chipman & Sons Co., 817 P.2d 382, 387 (Utah Ct. App. 1991). Under rule 60(b), a reasonable
time "depends upon the facts of each case, considering such factors as the interest in finality,
the reason for the delay, the practical ability of the litigant to learn earlier of the grounds
relied upon, and prejudice to other parties." Gillmor v. Wright, 850 P.2d 431, 435 (Utah 1993)
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In general, the moving party satisfies the
reasonable time requirement if she shows "that she acted diligently once the basis for relief
became available, and that the delay in seeking relief did not cause undue hardship to the
opposing party." Workman v. Nagle Constr., Inc., 802 P.2d 749, 752 (Utah Ct. App. 1990)
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
....
¶68 The problem with the State's argument is that the State fails to distinguish between a
motion that is properly supported for purposes of the particularity requirement and a motion
that is timely filed for purposes of avoiding the limitations provisions of 60(b). Both rule 7
and rule 4-501 are designed to "promote the policies of (1) mitigating prejudice to opposing
parties by allowing that party to respond to the motion . . . and (2) assuring that a court can be
apprised of the basis of a motion and rule upon it with a proper understanding." See Holmes
Dev., LLC v. Cook, 2002 UT 38, ¶ 58, 48 P.3d 895 (discussing requirements for motions to
amend). If a party fails to "comply with Utah's formal motion practice rules," a district court
may, within its discretion, deny the motion on the grounds that it is insufficient. Id. ¶ 59.
However, sufficiency is not a logically necessary component of timeliness. A party can timely
move the court for relief despite the fact that its motion may be insufficient because, for
example, it lacks particularity. In such a situation, the court has the discretion, consistent with
the policy concerns noted above, either to deny the motion as being insufficient or to allow
the party to supplement the originally insufficient motion. In the case before us, the district
court chose the latter option, holding that Menzies' 60(b) motion was timely filed and that
239

Menzies should be allowed to supplement the motion under the circumstances. The district
court was entirely within its discretion to do so.

Effective March 1, 2000, the initial citation of any published opinion of the Utah Supreme
Court or the Utah Court of Appeals, released on or after January 1, 1999, in any brief, table of
cases in the brief, memorandum, or other document filed in the Utah Supreme Court or the
Utah Court of Appeals, shall include the case name, the year the opinion was issued,
identification of the court that issued the opinion (UT for Utah Supreme Court and UT App
for the Utah Court of Appeals), and the sequential number assigned to the opinion by the
respective court. Citation to specific portions of the opinion shall be made by reference to the
paragraph numbers assigned by the court. A comma and then a paragraph symbol (¶) should
be placed immediately following the sequential number assigned to the case. Subsequent
citations within the brief, document, or memorandum should include the paragraph number
and sufficient references to identify the initial citation. Initial citations shall also include the
volume and initial page number of the Pacific Reporter in which the opinion is published.
When an opinion is in slip form awaiting inclusion in a Pacific Reporter volume, the slip
opinion form should be used. A pinpoint citation is not required in the parallel citation to the
Pacific Reporter since the paragraph numbers assigned by the court are included in the Pacific
Reporter version. Likewise, it is not necessary to include the year the case was published
since that will be evident from the initial citation.

Examples from Morin v. Essex Optical, 2005 VT 15, 868 A.2d 729
....
¶3. At the time of injury, claimant's average weekly wage was $ 475, and her resulting weekly
workers' compensation benefit was $ 317. During the period between her injury and the
Commissioner's compensation decision, she received a cost of living adjustment to her
temporary benefits every July 1 as mandated by 21 V.S.A. § 650(d). As a result, she was
receiving weekly compensation of $ 469 from July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2002. In July
2002, the annual cost of living adjustment would have increased her benefit to $ 489, an
amount in excess of her $ 475 average weekly wage at the time of her injury. Defendant's
insurance carrier refused to increase claimant's benefit. Claimant submitted the question to the
Commissioner in a motion for summary judgment, arguing that she was entitled to
continuedyearly increases under 21 V.S.A. § 650(d) irrespective of whether her benefit
amount exceeded her average weekly wage at the time of her injury. The Commissioner
denied the motion, and claimant appealed. On appeal, the Commissioner submitted the
following certified question: "Did the Department of Labor and Industry err in its
interpretation of 21 V.S.A. § 650(d) in concluding that a permanent total disability claimant's
weekly compensation rate could not exceed her average weekly wage?" We answer this
question in the affirmative.
¶4. This appeal involves a question of law, and "if the Commissioner's conclusions are
supported by the findings and reflect the correct interpretation of the law, we will affirm the
Commissioner's decision." Butler v. Huttig Bldg. Prods., 2003 VT 48, ¶ 9, 175 Vt. 323, 830
A.2d 44. Further, we will defer to the Commissioner's construction of the Workers'
Compensation Act, "absent a compelling indication of error." Wood v. Fletcher Allen Health
Care, 169 Vt. 419, 422, 739 A.2d 1201, 1204 (1999). Even under our deferential standard, we
conclude that the Commissioner's decision in this case is not supported by the findings and
reflects an unjust and unreasonable interpretation of the law. See Clodgo v. Rentavision, Inc.,
166 Vt. 548, 550, 701 A.2d 1044, 1045 (1997) (noting that we will not affirm an unjust
interpretation).
....
242

¶9. Defendant relies upon 21 V.S.A. § 601(19), arguing that "under the plain meaning of [that
section] the claimant's workers' compensation benefit is capped at the full amount of her
average weekly wage." . . . . Defendant's plain meaning argument is apparently based on the
second sentence of the section. That sentence applies, however, only "where the employee's
average weekly wage computed under section 650 of this title is lower than the minimum
weekly compensation." At the time of injury, claimant's average weekly wage was $ 475 per
week and, as conceded by defendant's counsel at oral argument, was above the minimum
weekly compensation then in effect. Indeed, even if this statute were construed to apply
beyond initial calculation of the compensation rate, claimant's average weekly wage of $ 475
continues to be higher than the current minimum of $ 305. Workers' Compensation Rule

Examples from Davenport v. Little-Bowser, 269 Va. 546, 611 S.E.2d 366 (2005)
....
In its brief and in much of its oral argument, the Commonwealth argued that "this Court
should defer to the Executive Branch's interpretation unless that interpretation is patently
unreasonable and represents an abuse of discretion" and that "it is well established that the
interpretation of the agency entrusted with the administration of a statute is entitled to
deference by this Court." In support of these contentions, the Commonwealth cites
Department of Taxation v. Westmoreland Coal Co., 235 Va. 94, 366 S.E. 2d 78, 4 Va. Law
Rep. 2024 (1988); Forst v. Rockingham Poultry Mktg. Coop., 222 Va. 270, 279 S.E. 2d 400
(1981); Commonwealth v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 217 Va. 121, 225 S.E. 2d 870 (1976);
Commonwealth v. Bluefield Sanitarium, 216 Va. 686, 222 S.E. 2d 526 (1976); and
Commonwealth v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 193 Va. 37, 68 S.E. 2d 122 (1951).
....
The Commonwealth's first statutory interpretation argument involves 12 VAC § 5-550-100
involving a certificate of live birth and 12 VAC § 5-550-330 concerning the issuance of a new
certificate after, among other circumstances, adoption. The Commonwealth reasons that a
certificate of live birth provides for listing of a mother and a father and a new certificate "shall
be on the form in use at the time of birth." 12 VAC § 5-550-330. The Commonwealth argues
that Code § 32.1-261(B) provides that "when a new certificate of birth is established pursuant
to subsection A of this section ...it shall be substituted for the original certificate of birth."
Because the statute requires "substitution" and the certificate of live birth provides for a
listing of a mother and a father, any new certificate "on the same form in use at the time of
birth" is inadequate to list two same-sex adoptive parents.
....
Additionally, the Court of Appeals of Virginia has stated that
"'the interpretation which an administrative agency gives its [law] must be accorded great
deference. ' Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, 9 Va. App. 152, 159, 384 S.E. 2d 622, 626, 6
Va. Law Rep. 663 (1989). 'The trial courts may reverse the administrative agency's
interpretation only if the agency's construction of its [law] is arbitrary or capricious or fails
to fulfill the agency's purpose as defined by its basic law. ' Id. at 161, 384 S.E. 2d at 627."
Jackson v. W., 14 Va. App. 391, 400-401, 419 S.E. 2d 385, 390, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2880 (1992).
Applying the well-established precedent of this Court and of the Court of Appeals, I would
accord the Registrar's interpretation of Code § 32.1-261 the deference to which it is entitled,
and I would affirm the judgment of the circuit court.

Examples from Dot Foods, Inc. v. Dep't of Revenue, 166 Wash. 2d 912, 215 P.3d
185 (2009)
¶1 C. Johnson, J. - This case involves a challenge to the Department of Revenue's
(Department) interpretation of RCW 82.04.423, which provides a tax exemption for certain
out-of-state sellers. Until 2000, the Department treated Dot Foods, Inc. Click for Enhanced
Coverage Linking Searches, an out-of-state seller, as exempt from Washington's business and
occupation (B&O) tax. At all relevant times, Dot sold consumer and nonconsumer products
through its direct seller's representative, Dot Transportation, Inc. (DTI), and some of the
consumer products ultimately ended up in permanent retail establishments. In 1999, in
amending WAC 458-20-246, the Department revised its interpretation of the qualifications
needed for the exemption. This revision changed the Department's prior interpretation, and
under the new interpretation, Dot no longer qualified for the exemption for any of its sales.
Dot filed suit challenging this interpretation, and the trial court entered summary judgment in
favor of the Department, which the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reverse.
....
¶3 For many years, Dot received a B&O tax exemption for 100 percent of its sales pursuant to
RCW 82.04.423, which exempts from the tax “gross income derived from the business of
making sales at wholesale or retail” if the seller meets several criteria listed in the statute.
RCW 82.04.423(1). Among these criteria, the out-of-state seller must “[m]ake[?] sales in this
state exclusively to or through a direct seller's representative.” RCW 82.04.423(1)(d). Under
the statute, a “direct seller's representative” is one who buys, sells, or solicits the sale of
consumer products in places other than a permanent retail establishment. RCW 82.04.423(2).
Between 1997 and 2000, Dot received B&O tax-exempt status even though it sold both
consumer and nonconsumer products. Also, Dot received this tax exemption during this time
even though some of the products purchased from Dot were later sold to permanent retail
establishments without Dot's or DTI's involvement.

....
¶14 The Department argues that its statutory interpretation is entitled to judicial deference.
While we give great deference to how an agency interprets an ambiguous statute within its
area of special expertise, “such deference is not afforded when the statute in question is
unambiguous.” Densley v. Dep't of Ret. Sys., 162 Wn.2d 210, 221, 173 P.3d 885 (2007). The
Department's argument for deference is a difficult one to accept, considering the Department's
history interpreting the exemption. Initially, and shortly after the statutory enactment, the
Department adopted an interpretation which is at odds with its current interpretation. One
would think that the Department had some involvement or certainly awareness of the
legislature's plans to enact this type of statute. As a general rule, where a statute has been left
unchanged by the legislature for a significant period of time, the more appropriate method to
change the interpretation or application of a statute is by amendment or revision of the statute,
rather than a new agency interpretation.

made to page numbers in the official reports, to paragraph numbers from the official reports,
or to both." Id.

Examples from State v. T.J. Int'l, Inc., 2001 WI 76, 244 Wis. 2d 481, 628 N.W.2d
774
....
¶4 We conclude that the definition of "business closing" in Wis. Stat. § 109.07(1)(b) does not
include the sale of business assets where there is no actual operational shutdown--permanent
or temporary--of the employment site. Where, as here, the transfer of ownership continues
rather than interrupts or ceases the operation of the employment site, there is no "business
closing" under the statute, and no 60-day notice of the sale is required. Accordingly, we
affirm the court of appeals' reversal of the judgment of the circuit court.
....
¶18 The court of appeals reversed, concluding that the plain language of the statute's
definition of "business closing" required a "permanent or temporary shutdown of an
employment site," and because the Hawkins plant never shut down, there was no "business
closing" within the meaning of the statute. State v. T.J. Int'l, Inc., 2000 WI App 181, ¶10, 238
Wis. 2d 173, 617 N.W.2d 256. We accepted the State's petition for review.
¶19 We review a circuit court order granting or denying a motion for summary judgment
independently, using the same methodology as the circuit court. Jankee v. Clark County, 2000
WI 64, ¶48, 235 Wis. 2d 700, 612 N.W.2d 297. Summary judgment is appropriate when there
are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law. Wis. Stat. § 802.08(2).
....
¶32 We note that Wis. Admin. Code § DWD 279.002 (Apr., 2001), entitled "Interpretation"
specifies that "whenever possible, this chapter will be interpreted in a manner consistent with
the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 USC 2101 et seq., the
federal regulations and court decisions interpreting that Act to the extent that the provisions of
federal and state law are the same." Both defendants cite federal cases interpreting the WARN
Act in support of their positions. We agree with the State that none of these cases is
particularly helpful to our analysis of the Wisconsin law.

Examples from Amoco Prod. Co. v. Bd. of County Comm'rs, 2002 WY 154, 55
P.3d 1246 (Wyo. 2002)
....
[¶4] In 1985, State regulations concerning the Wyoming mineral tax system were amended
and, in part, allowed take-in-kind owners, like Amoco with respect to the Properties, to file
their own reports with the State and directly pay related taxes. DOR Rules, ch. XXI, § 7(c). In
addition, in 1989, the State of Wyoming, Department of Audit (DOA) was created to
supervise the Wyoming mineral tax system. Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 9-2-2003. Upon its institution,
the DOA began to perform oil and gas audits. Likewise, separate from these audits, other
counties within Wyoming, including Sweetwater County, began to conduct their own audits
primarily through contract arrangements. The contract auditor retained by Sweetwater County
reviewed production reports for the Properties and found significant volumes of unreported
production for the years 1980 through 1985. These findings were sent to the State of
Wyoming, Department of Revenue (DOR) for review and assessment.
....
[¶10] Our standard of review is well established. We recently reiterated this standard of
review in the case of Bevan v. Fix, 2002 WY 43, ¶13, 42 P.3d 1013, ¶13 (Wyo. 2002):
Summary judgment is appropriate if the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party, reveals that no genuine issues of material fact exist and the prevailing
party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Worley v. Wyoming Bottling Co., Inc., 1
P.3d 615, 620 (Wyo. 2000); Terry v. Pioneer Press, Inc., 947 P.2d 273, 275 (Wyo. 1997);
Davis v. Wyoming Medical Center, Inc., 934 P.2d 1246, 1250 (Wyo. 1997); W.R.C.P.
56(c). A fact is material if it establishes or refutes an essential element of a claim or
defense. Tidwell v. HOM, Inc., 896 P.2d 1322, 1324 (Wyo. 1995). In evaluating summary
250

judgment, we apply the same standards as the trial court, without affording any deference
to the trial court's decisions on issues of law. Wilder v. Cody Country Chamber of
Commerce, 868 P.2d 211, 216 (Wyo. 1994).

Wyo. Sup. Ct., Order Adopting a Uniform or Neutral-Format Citation (Oct. 2,
2000), http://www.courts.state.wy.us/LawLibrary/univ_cit.pdf.
This Matter came before the Court by direction of the Board of Judicial Policy and
Administration, in recognition of the increasing level of legal research being conducted via
the Internet and other electronic resources, to adopt a public domain, neutral-format citation
which will support use of legal sources in both the traditional book and electronic formats.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, from and after January 1, 2001:
(1) At the time of issuance, this Court shall assign to all opinions and to those orders
designated by this Court for publication (hereinafter referred to as substantive orders) a
citation which shall include the calendar year in which the opinion or substantive order is
issued followed by the Wyoming U.S. Postal Code (WY) followed by a consecutive number
beginning each year with "1" (for example, 2001 WY 1). This public domain, neutral-format
citation shall appear on the title page of each opinion and on the first page of each substantive
order issued by this Court. All publishers of Wyoming Supreme Court materials are requested
to include this public domain, neutral-format citation within the heading of each opinion or
substantive order they publish.
(2) Beginning with the first paragraph of text, each paragraph in every such opinion and
substantive order shall be numbered consecutively beginning with a symbol followed by an
Arabic numeral, flush with the left margin, opposite the first word of the paragraph. Paragraph
numbers shall continue consecutively throughout the text of the majority opinion or
substantive order and any concurring or dissenting opinions or rationale. Paragraphs within
footnotes shall not be numbered nor shall markers, captions, headings or Roman numerals,
which merely divide opinions or sections thereof. Block-indented single-spaced portions of a
paragraph shall not be numbered as a separate paragraph. All publishers of Wyoming
Supreme Court materials are requested to include these paragraph numbers in each opinion or
substantive order they publish.
(3) In the case of opinions which are not to be cited as precedent (per curium opinions) and in
the case of all substantive orders (unless otherwise specifically designated by this Court), the
consecutive number in the public domain or neutral-format citation shall be followed by the
letter "N" to indicate that the opinion or substantive order is not to be cited as precedent in
any brief, motion or document filed with this Court or elsewhere (for example, 2001 WY 1N).
(4) In the case of opinions or substantive orders which are withdrawn or vacated by a
subsequent order of this Court, the public domain, neutral-format citation of the withdrawing
or vacating order shall be the same as the original public domain, neutral-format citation but
followed by a letter "W" (for example, 2001 WY 1W). An opinion or substantive order issued
in place of one withdrawn or vacated shall be assigned the next consecutive number
appropriate to the date on which it is issued.
251

(5) In the case of opinions or substantive orders which are amended by a subsequent order of
this Court, the public domain, neutral-format citation of the amending order shall be the same
as the original public domain, neutral-format citation but followed by a letter "A" (for
example, 2001 WY 1A). Amended paragraphs shall contain the same number as the
paragraph being amended. Additional paragraphs shall contain the same number as the
immediately preceding original paragraph but with the addition of a lower case letter (for
example, if two new paragraphs are added following paragraph 13 of the original opinion, the
new paragraphs will be numbered 13a and 13b). If a paragraph is deleted, the number of the
deleted paragraph shall be skipped in the sequence of paragraph numbering in any
subsequently published version of the amended opinion of substantive order, provided that at
the point where the paragraph was deleted, there shall be a note indicating the deletion of that
paragraph.
(6) For cases decided between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2003, for documents filed
with the Court, a proper citation shall also include the volume and initial page number of the
West Pacific Reporter in which the opinion is published. For cases decided after December
31, 2003, reference to the volume and initial page number of the West Pacific Reporter in
which the opinion is published shall be optional in documents filed with the Court. The
Wyoming Reporter will remain the official reporter of this Court's opinions and, where West
Pacific Reporter citations are available at the time an opinion is issued, this Court will
continue to cite to the West Pacific Reporter in addition to the public domain, neutral-format
citation in all of its opinions.
(7) The following are examples of proper citations to Wyoming Supreme Court opinions:
For cases decided before January 1, 2001:
Primary cite:
Roe v. Doe, 989 P.2d 472 (Wyo. 1997).
Primary cite with pinpoint cite:
Roe v. Doe, 989 P.2d 472, 475 (Wyo. 2001).
Pinpoint cite alone:

For cases decided from and after January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2003:
Primary cite:
Doe v. Roe, 2001 WY 12, 989 P.2d 1312 (Wyo. 2001).
Primary cite with pinpoint cite:
