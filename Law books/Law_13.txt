Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my wife, Anne, and my children, Lyndsey, Keith and Caroline, for their
support and for all of the time that we spent walking, hiking, running, climbing, paddling and
otherwise enjoying the outdoors over the years, which provided the inspiration for this
project. I would also like to thank Mercer Law School for providing me with a sabbatical and
financial support for this project. I owe special thanks to the colleagues who agreed to be
interviewed for this project or hosted those interviews and to everyone who provided
suggestions and comments on drafts of the work. Finally, I would like to dedicate this

About the Author
Stephen M. Johnson is the W.F.G. Professor of Law at Mercer University Law School in
Macon, Georgia. He received his J.D. from Villanova University School of Law and an
LL.M. in environmental law from the George Washington University Law School. Prior to
teaching, he served as an attorney for the Bureau of Regulatory Counsel in the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now DEP) and as a trial attorney
for the U.S. Department of Justice, Environment and Natural Resources Division,
Environmental Defense Section, where he worked on wetlands litigation and other
environmental litigation.
He joined the Mercer faculty in 1993 and served as the Associate Dean for Academic
Affairs from 2002-2012. He specializes in Environmental Law, but has also taught Torts,
Statutory Law, Administrative Law, and Dispute Resolution. His scholarship focuses on
wetlands, environmental justice, economics and the environment, technology and the law,
and administrative law. In addition to authoring numerous articles on those topics, he has
edited an American Bar Association book on Wetlands law and has authored a book on
economic approaches to environmental protection. He has also authored several CALI
exercises on wetlands and environmental law and has served on the Board of Directors of
CALI for more than a decade.
While teaching at Mercer, he has been fortunate to teach or visit at Notre Dame Law
School, the University of London and Strathclyde University. In 2004, he taught at the
University of Tokyo and at Waseda University (Tokyo) on a Fulbright grant.

Preface
Course Source: The Casebook Evolved
You’ll notice that these materials are entitled, Wetlands Law: A Course Source. I chose
the term “course source,” as opposed to casebook or coursebook, to indicate that the
format of these materials is qualitatively different from traditional law school textbooks.
I.

Traditional casebooks and the evolution of casebooks

The law school casebooks that were created in the late 1800's to implement Christopher
Columbus Langdell’s case method of teaching consisted primarily of edited versions of
cases and perhaps a few questions and comments. Casebooks have evolved slowly over
the years. Over time, it became popular to incorporate excerpts from law review articles,
statutes and regulations into the texts in addition to the cases, questions and comments.
Little changed for decades until problem-based books came along, incorporating a wealth
of hypotheticals and problems that allowed students to apply the law that they were
learning from the cases, statutes, and regulations included in the book. Those books could
more precisely be referred to as “coursebooks” than “casebooks,” because they
incorporated more than cases, questions and comments.
After the MacCrate report in the 1990s and the 2007 Carnegie Foundation report, faculty
and book publishers began publishing separate books focusing on skills development that
could be used to supplement traditional casebooks and coursebooks. In a few cases,
books that were not marketed as “skills” books incorporated some skills exercises as well.
Publishers also began marketing “law stories” books that provided a wealth of background
information about a few cases to help bring those cases to life. Those were positive
developments in the evolution of law school teaching materials.
II.

The “Course Source”: The technological evolution of the casebook

Technology can help casebooks and coursebooks evolve into a new format. Several years
ago, publishers began marketing e-books for the law school market. So far, e-books for law
school have not taken full advantage of the medium. A few of the early books were simply
electronic versions of traditional casebooks or coursebooks. Others added a few hyperlinks
to a traditional casebook or coursebook. For the most part, though, the changes in the
format of casebooks and coursebooks in the e-book era have been modest. Much more is
possible. Technology can foster the transformation of the casebook and the coursebook
into the “course source” - a one-stop shop for all of a faculty member’s teaching resource
needs.
xv

The Carnegie Foundation Report, Educating Lawyers: Preparation for the Profession of
Law, stressed the importance of three apprenticeships in the formation of a lawyer - the
cognitive apprenticeship, the apprenticeship in the forms of expert practice shared by
practitioners, and the apprenticeship of identity and purposes (professionalism). In short,
the report stressed that law schools should be training students in the knowledge, skills,
and values necessary to the legal profession. A “course source,” the next generation of law
teaching materials, can utilize technology to provide resources for training students in all
three apprenticeships. A “course source” recognizes that the three apprenticeships are
interconnected and that a faculty member needs the tools to train students in all three
apprenticeships, rather than assuming that a separate course in legal professionalism or
research and writing will develop the student’s skills and values.
In addition, legal educators have increasingly recognized the importance of formative and
summative assessment, and the American Bar Association’s Standards for Approval of Law
Schools require schools to use both formative and summative assessment in their
curriculum “to measure and improve student learning and to provide meaningful feedback
to students.” A “course source” provides a variety of tools for formative and summative
assessment.
A “course source” also takes advantage of the wealth of materials available online and in a
variety of media formats to incorporate links to content that puts the cases, materials and
disputes in the book in context, to provide a fuller and richer understanding of the materials.
Further, a “course source” is portable and customizable, since it is distributed through a
Creative Commons license as open source materials. Thus, faculty can pick and choose
the portions of the materials that they find most useful and relevant for their teaching and
distribute those materials to students for free.
A “course source” is available in a variety of formats as an e-book, but most of the content
and links in the book will also be re-purposed as a web-based library of teaching resources
related to the topic of the book.
III.

Wetlands Law: A Course Source

This “course source” on wetlands law implements the vision outlined in the preceding
section. The Wetlands Law Course Source includes resources to train students in all three
apprenticeships. To address the knowledge apprenticeship, the “course source” includes
all of the traditional elements of a casebook or coursebook (cases, commentary, notes and
questions) and includes several hypotheticals and problem exercises that focus on
reinforcing wetlands law. In addition, as one of the many forms of summative and formative
assessment included in the book, every chapter includes one or more CALI exercise as a

xvi

“quiz” to reinforce the material covered in the chapter. The course source also includes
links to other CALI exercises on topics related to the material covered in the book.
To address the skills apprenticeship, the “course source” includes sixteen separate legal
research exercises, several drafting exercises (including exercises that focus on drafting a
FOIA request, drafting comments on a proposed regulation, and drafting a citizen suit
complaint and 60 day notice letter), a negotiation exercise, and an interviewing and
counseling exercise.
To address the values apprenticeship, the “course source” includes several
professionalism scenarios, with questions related to the scenarios.
As noted above, the “course source” also incorporates a wealth of audio/video materials
and external links to bring the cases, disputes and materials in the book to life. For
instance, links are provided to the audio for the oral arguments in most of the principal
cases excerpted in the book. A Google map is included in the book, identifying the location
of the properties involved in all of the principal cases excerpted in the book, so that
students can see the wetlands that were preserved in the cases or the development that
replaced the wetlands. For most of the principal cases that are excerpted in the book, there
are links to decision documents, administrative orders, property maps, pictures, local media
coverage or other background materials. While the principal cases have been edited, the
book includes links to the full unedited versions of all of the principal cases in the book.
Throughout each chapter, there are several “Resource” sections that identify reports,
databases, audio or video materials, government documents, and other materials that are
relevant to the topics covered in the chapter.
The book also links to (1) a series of videos prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers that
describe the wetland delineation process, wetland mitigation, the wetland permitting
process and many other wetland-related issues; (2) videos demonstrating mountaintop
removal mining; and (3) videos outlining the values and functions of wetlands. In addition,
the book contains links to interviews that I conducted regarding a variety of different
wetland issues with attorneys who work with local communities and with the Department of
Justice, the National Wildlife Federation, and the Environmental Council of the States.
Those interviews are posted on YouTube.
Since the “course source” is distributed under a Creative Commons license, it was also
possible to include several pictures of wetlands and activities that take place in wetlands in
the book, as the pictures are available through the Wikimedia Commons for materials that
are distributed under the Creative Commons license. Most of the cases that are cited in the
book, other than cases that are only cited in the excerpts of the principal cases, are linked
to full, unedited opinions that are available online for free through Justia.com. Further,
almost all of the statutes, regulations, reports, databases, and government documents in
the book are hyperlinked to external sources. The 400 page book includes almost 1000
xvii

links. I hope you will find this “course source” to be a useful and engaging teaching and
learning tool.
The links in the book have also been re-purposed as a web-based library of wetlands
teaching resources, which is accessible at:
http://www.envirolawteachers.com/wetlands-law-a-course-source.html

Wetland Values and Functions

This is a book about wetlands, and the laws that protect wetlands. It seems only natural,
therefore, to begin the book by looking at the reasons that there are laws to protect
wetlands. This first chapter begins with a focus on the values and functions of wetlands.
In the 19th century, wetlands were considered “a menace, the cause of malaria, and a
hindrance to land development.” See U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment,
OTA-O-206, Wetlands: Their Use and Regulation 37 (Mar. 1984). Attitudes towards
wetlands have changed greatly since then as scientists and the public have discovered the
societal benefits and important ecological functions of wetlands. The United Nations
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment determined that the ecosystem services provided
globally by wetlands in 1997 were worth 15 trillion dollars. See Ramsar Convention on
Wetlands, Ramsar Convention Secretariat, Wetland Ecosystem Services - An Introduction.
Consequently, wetlands frequently provide far greater economic benefits as part of healthy
functioning ecosystems than they would provide after being converted to other uses. Id.
The “ecosystem services” and other values and functions provided by wetlands include:



Provision of Habitat / Protection of Species and Biodiversity



Flood Control



Erosion Prevention and Shoreline Stabilization / Protection



Water Quality Protection (removal of sediments, nutrients and toxics)



Groundwater Replenishment



Climate Regulation



Wetland Products (timber, food products, etc.)



Recreation, Aesthetics, and Education



Protection of Cultural Values
i

Not every wetland provides all of the functions outlined above. The services that each
wetland provides will vary based on the type of wetland, its size and location. See Ramsar
Convention on Wetlands, Ramsar Convention Secretariat, Wetland Ecosystem Services An Introduction. However, the services that each wetland provides generally benefit much
broader segments of the public than would be benefitted by the conversion of the wetlands
to unsustainable uses. Id. It is not always easy to get that message across, though, as, in
the past, there has frequently been a lack of concrete economic data available to
demonstrate the monetary value of preserving wetlands in their natural state. Id. In
addition, some of the values provided by wetlands, such as recreation, aesthetics,
education, research and protection of cultural values, are difficult to quantify in dollar
figures. Nevertheless, methods for assessing the value of ecosystem services are maturing
and a recent study demonstrated that coastal wetlands in the United States provide storm
protection worth over 23 billion dollars per year, so that the conversion of one hectare
(about 2 ½ acres) of coastal wetlands would eliminate about 33,000 dollars worth of storm
protection per year. Id; see also Institute for European Environmental Policy, The
Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity for Water and Wetlands 19-33 (2013).
Many of the values and functions provided by wetlands, such as water quality protection,
flood control, shoreline stabilization, atmospheric maintenance, and groundwater
replenishment, are tied to the integral role of wetlands within the hydrologic cycle. Wetlands
receive, store and release water physically through ground water and surface water, and
biologically through transpiration by vegetation. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
Watershed Academy Web, Distance Learning Modules on Watershed Management,
Wetland Functions and Values 5 [hereinafter “Watershed Academy Web”]; see also
Institute for European Environmental Policy, The Economics of Ecosystems and
Biodiversity for Water and Wetlands 5-6 (2013). Wetlands are frequently referred to as
“nature’s kidneys.” See Association of State Wetlands Managers, The Compleat Wetlander:
Wetlands - Nature’s Kidneys and Other Specialized Services (Feb. 23, 2010). The United
States Supreme Court recognized the central role that wetlands play in the hydrologic cycle
and discussed the importance of protecting wetlands in order to protect ecosystems in
United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, 474 U.S. 121, 132-133 (1985). The diverse
values and functions that wetlands provide are discussed in more detail in the following
sections.

A.

Provision of Habitat / Protection of Species
and Biodiversity

Wetlands are sometimes referred to as “nurseries of life”
because they provide the essential elements of habitat food, water, and shelter - for thousands of species of
aquatic and terrestrial plants and animals. See U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, Wetlands Overview.

Almost 50% of endangered animal species in the United States depend on wetlands for
survival and viability, even though wetlands only occupy about 3.5% of the land area in the
U.S. See William J. Mitsch, James G. Gosselink, Wetlands 344 (4th ed. John Wiley & Sons,
2007). More generally, according to Fish and Wildlife Service estimates, 43% of all of the
federally listed endangered or threatened species rely on wetlands either directly or
indirectly. See Watershed Academy Web at 7. Not surprisingly, therefore, the Secretariat
for the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands has referred to wetlands as “reservoirs of
biodiversity.” See Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Ramsar Convention Secretariat,
Wetland Ecosystem Services - An Introduction. Globally, coastal wetlands “contain some of
the most biologically diverse and productive communities in the world.” Id.
Wetlands are not just habitat for endangered or threatened species, though. About 80% of
the breeding bird population in the United States rely on wetlands for their primary habitat.
See Mitsch & Gosselink, supra at 336. Between 1950 and 1994, for instance, the coastal
wetlands in the Chesapeake Bay Region supported an annual average of 79,000 black
ducks and 14,000 pintails on their southernly migration. See Watershed Academy Web at
7. Two thirds of the 10-12 million migratory waterfowl in the continental United States
reproduce in the prairie pothole wetlands of the Midwest. See U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Wetlands Overview. Many animals, including beavers and wood ducks,
and plants, including wild rice and cattails, rely almost exclusively on wetlands. Id. at 6.
Wetlands provide rich habitats for several reasons. In many
wetlands, the shallow water, high levels of inorganic nutrients, and
high rates of productivity of new plant biomass combine to provide
ideal conditions for the development of organisms at the bottom of
the food chain. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
America’s Wetlands: Our Vital Link Between Land and Water 6-7
(2003) [hereinafter “America’s Wetlands”]. In addition, the plant
biomass in the wetlands is increasingly enriched as it breaks down
due to bacterial, fungal and protozoan activity. Id. at 6. The
biomass provides food for small invertebrates and fish, which, in
turn, provide food for larger amphibians, reptiles, fish, birds and
Photo 2
mammals. Id. The high levels of biomass and invertebrate life
https://commons.wikime
make wetlands an important nursery area for many fish and
dia.org/wiki/File:Cattails
shellfish.
See Watershed Academy Web at 7. Further, many species
_in_the_Everglades.jpg
of fish rely on wetlands because they require areas of shallow water
[Public Domain]
for breeding and feeding, or for some other portion of their life cycle.
Id. at 4; see also William A. Niering, Wetlands 32 (Chanticleer Press, 1985).

B.

Flood Control

Wetlands help prevent or minimize flooding and flood damage by storing and slowing
water. See America’s Wetlands, at 8. Like sponges, wetlands absorb and slowly release
rain, snow melt, groundwater and surface water, including flood waters. Id. By doing so,
they reduce the speed and volume of
runoff entering streams and rivers. See
Ramsar Convention on Wetlands,
Ramsar
Convention
Secretariat,
Wetland Ecosystem Services - Flood
Control [hereinafter “Ramsar - Flood
Control”] The trees and vegetation in
wetlands can also slow the speed of
flood waters and distribute them over the
floodplain. See America’s Wetlands, at
8. By storing and slowing water,
wetlands can reduce flood heights and
reduce erosion downstream. See Photo 3 By LSUSoccerbum
Watershed Academy Web, at 9. The http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clearview_Metair
ie_08_30_2005.jpg [Public Domain]
flood control benefits provided by
wetlands can be particularly important near urban areas where there are significant
volumes of runoff from pavement and buildings. Id. Regardless of where the wetlands are
located, though, by reducing flooding and flood damages, wetlands provide economic
benefits, by reducing property damages, and protect health, safety and welfare. Id. at 10.
When wetlands within a floodplain are converted to other uses, peak river discharges
following snowmelt or heavy rains that used to dissipate broadly across the floodplain are
concentrated in a smaller area, leading to deeper and more damaging floods. See Ramsar
- Flood Control. Prior to significant filling and draining, the bottomland hardwood riparian
wetlands of the Mississippi River used to store almost 60 days of floodwater. See America’s
Wetlands, at 8-9. Now, they only store about 12 days of floodwater. Id. Engineered flood
control measures, such as dredging or the construction of levees, are significantly more
expensive than preserving or restoring wetlands. Id. A study in Minnesota determined that it
would cost 1.5 million dollars per year to replace the flood control provided by 5000 acres
of drained wetlands. See Watershed Academy Web, at 10.
Coastal wetlands can play a significant role in protecting communities from storm surges
and conversion of those wetlands reduces those natural defenses. See Ramsar - Flood
Control. When Hurricane Katrina inundated 80% of the City of New Orleans in 2005, many
experts suggested that the destruction of significant amounts of coastal wetlands in the
decades prior to the storm, and the artificial constriction of the Mississippi River’s
floodplains contributed to the magnitude of the flooding. Id. Protection of coastal wetlands
is particularly important in light of the fact that 39% of the U.S. population lived in coastal
4

shoreline counties in 2010, even though those counties represented less than 10% of the
land area of the United States (excluding Alaska). See U.S. Department of Commerce,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA’s State of the Coast. In addition,
the population in those counties increased 39% between 1970 and 2010. Id.

C.

Erosion Prevention and Shoreline Protection/Stabilization

Just as wetlands prevent or reduce
flooding by storing and slowing water
flows, they also protect shorelines and
stream banks from erosion. See
America’s Wetlands, at 9. The roots of
wetland plants stabilize the soil and the
plants absorb wave energy and break up
currents. Id. Erosion prevention can
provide significant benefits, as coastal
erosion causes 500 million dollars in
coastal property loss each year,
including damage to structures and
conversion of land to aquatic areas. See

Coastal Hazards. A study by the Heinz
Center in 2000 estimated that erosion may destroy one quarter of the houses located within
500 feet of the shoreline by the middle of this century. Id. The federal government spends
about 150 million dollars each year on erosion control measures. Id. In recognition of the
erosion prevention benefits of wetlands, some states are restoring coastal wetlands to
provide buffers from storm surges. See America’s Wetlands, at 9.

D.

Water Quality Protection

Wetlands play a vital role in protecting and
improving water quality by removing sediments,
organic and sometimes toxic pollutants, and excess
nutrients from water and storing and/or processing
those materials. See America’s Wetlands, at 8.
Wetland soils and vegetation capture and retain
nutrients in water that might otherwise cause
dangerous levels of nutrients in groundwater that
serves as a drinking water source or cause
eutrophication of downstream water bodies.

Ecosystem Services - Water Purification [hereinafter “Ramsar - Water Purification”].
Eutrophication of water bodies causes massive growth in algae, which depletes oxygen in
the water and blocks sunlight which is essential for many of the plants and animals in the
water. Id.
Just as wetlands remove and store nutrients, wetland plants trap suspended sediments that
could otherwise smother downstream spawning areas, insects and plants. See America’s
Wetlands, at 8. In addition, increased turbidity in streams caused by excess sediments can
lead to increased water temperatures, reduced light penetration and plant growth, and
reduced visibility in the stream, making it more difficult for fish to find prey. See North
Carolina State University, Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Soil in Our
Streams, Stream Notes, Vol. 1, No. 1. Some wetland animals, such as oysters in the
Chesapeake Bay, can even help to filter out nutrients and sediments from water that flows
through wetlands. See Ramsar - Water Purification.
Wetland plants also protect water quality by removing and storing organic wastes. See
America’s Wetlands, at 8. There are clear economic benefits associated with this filtering
function, as a 1990 study determined that the Congaree Swamp in South Carolina removes
as much pollution from the water as would be removed by a 5 million dollar wastewater
treatment plant. Id. Similarly, in 1997, the city of New York determined that it could spend
less than half as much to protect the city’s water quality by purchasing and protecting
wetlands than it would spend if it constructed new wastewater treatment plants. See
Ramsar - Water Purification. Governments and developers are even constructing wetlands
to remove nutrients or waste from contaminated water. Id.
Some wetland plants can even remove heavy metals and other toxic substances from the
water that flows through wetlands. Id. As a result, wetlands are being constructed to treat
wastewater from mining and other activities, as well as to treat sewage effluent. See
Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Ramsar Convention Secretariat, Wetland Ecosystem
Services - Sediment and Nutrient Retention and Export.
Although wetlands can provide these water quality protection features, excessive levels of
nutrients, sediments, or pollutants in wetlands can degrade the wetlands and reduce or
eliminate many of the values that they would otherwise provide. See Watershed Academy
Web, at 9.

E.

Groundwater Replenishment

Depending on their location and type, wetlands may maintain stream flow during dry
periods and may replenish groundwater. See America’s Wetlands, at 8. Although some
wetlands have no connection to groundwater, others are located on permeable soils
overlaying aquifers. See Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Ramsar Convention Secretariat,
Wetland Ecosystem Services - Groundwater Replenishment. In those wetlands, water can
6

percolate through the soil into the aquifer to recharge the aquifer when the water table is
low. Id. Conversely, when the water table is high, the wetland can serve as a groundwater
discharge zone. Id. Globally, almost 95% of available fresh water is contained in
groundwater aquifers, and one third of the world’s population relies on groundwater for
drinking water. Id. One of the most productive groundwater sources in the United States is
the Floridan aquifer system, which stretches throughout Florida, southern Georgia, and
portions of South Carolina and Alabama. See Watershed Academy Web, at 9. Wetlands in
Florida play an important role in recharging that aquifer, as a study found that groundwater
in a particular area of the aquifer would be reduced by 45% if 80% of a 5 acre Florida
cypress swamp in the area was drained. Id.

F.

Climate Regulation

While many of the values and functions of wetlands are tied to water and water quality,
wetlands can also provide climatic benefits. Some wetlands, especially peat bogs, store
large amounts of carbon, functioning as “carbon sinks.” See Ramsar Convention on
Wetlands, Ramsar Convention Secretariat, Wetland Ecosystem Services - Climate Change
Mitigation & Adaptation. By doing so, they help slow the rate of greenhouse gas emissions
that contribute to global climate change. Id. However, when wetlands are converted for
development, trees and vegetation are removed and sometimes burned, releasing the
carbon that was stored in the wetlands into the atmosphere. Id. Those releases may be
significant. A recent study indicated that damage to peatlands caused greenhouse gas
emissions equal to 1/10 of the emissions from the worldwide use of fossil fuels. Id.
Wetlands will be impacted by, and impact society’s response to climate change in several
ways. First, to the extent that climate change results in the predicted sea level rise and
extreme weather events, wetlands will play an important role in adaptation due to the flood
control, erosion prevention, groundwater replenishment, habitat protection, and water
quality protection functions that they can serve. Id. They can only provide those benefits,
though, if they survive. Unfortunately, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) cautions that wetlands are among the ecosystems “most
vulnerable to climate change.” Id.

G.

Wetland Products

Wetlands may also provide more tangible economic
benefits in the form of products that can be
harvested from them. Cranberries, blueberries, rice
and many other plants are produced in wetlands.
See America’s Wetlands, at 10. Various medicines
can also be extracted from wetland plants and soils.
Id.

Timber is frequently harvested from wetlands, and there are 55 million acres of wetlands
supporting timber harvesting in the United States. See U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, EPA-841-R-02-001, National Water Quality Inventory, 2000 Report 45 (2002)
[hereinafter “2000 National Water Quality Inventory”]. Fish and shellfish are another
wetland “product.” In the southeastern United States, about 96% of the fish and shellfish
that are harvested commercially, and 50% of the fish that are caught by recreational
fishers, rely on estuarine or coastal wetlands. See Watershed Academy Web, at 11.
Nationally, about 75% of the fish and shellfish that are harvested commercially depend on
wetlands for food or habitat. Id. More than 2 billion dollars worth of fish and shellfish are
harvested commercially in the United States every year. Id.
Wetlands provide essential habitat for several other animals that are trapped and sold
commercially, including muskrat, beaver, otter, mink and alligators. Id. at 12. In 2000, EPA
estimated that more than 70 million dollars worth of muskrat pelts were harvested every
year. See 2000 National Water Quality Inventory, at 45.

H.

Recreation, Aesthetics, Education and Research

In addition to the values outlined above, wetlands often provide opportunities for recreation,
education and research. EPA estimates that more than half of the adult population in the
United States hunts, fishes, engages in bird-watching or photographs wildlife, and that they
spend about 59.5 billion dollars per year on those activities. See America’s Wetlands, at
10. A 2011 survey conducted by the Fish and Wildlife Service found that the annual
expenditures had increased to 144.5 billion. See U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011 National Survey of Fishing,
Hunting, and Wildlife Associated Recreation 4 (2011). A significant amount of that hunting,
fishing, or wildlife watching takes place in wetlands, as the natural beauty and diversity of
animal and plant life in many wetlands promotes recreational tourism. See Ramsar
Convention on Wetlands, Ramsar Convention Secretariat, Wetland Ecosystem Services Recreation & Tourism [hereinafter “Ramsar - Recreation and Tourism”]. In EPA’s National
Water Quality Inventory report to Congress in 2000, the agency indicated that “[a]t least
$18 billion in economic activity is generated annually from recreational fishing in coastal
wetlands by 17 million Americans.” See 2000 National Water Quality Inventory, at 45.
While hunting, fishing and bird-watching attract many people to wetlands, others visit to
hike, boat, paint, photograph, record, or otherwise appreciate the beauty and aesthetics of
the wetland ecosystems. See America’s Wetlands, at 10. Many of those wetland values are
difficult to capture in purely economic terms.
Wetlands provide rich educational opportunities for students of all ages, ranging from
grammar schools through adult continuing education programs and programs at nature
centers. See Watershed Academy Web, at 13. As EPA notes, wetlands are excellent sites
“to learn about vegetative structure ... and ecological functions ..., natural ecological
8

processes ..., biodiversity, and plant-animal interactions.” Id.
While wetlands can provide significant recreational and educational opportunities, some
recreational or tourism uses of wetlands could harm wetlands, so wetland managers
frequently must limit recreational and educational uses to specific areas to protect the
wetlands.See Ramsar - Recreation & Tourism.

I.

Protection of Cultural Values

In some cases, wetlands can also be closely tied to the cultural heritage of the surrounding
communities. The songs, music, dance, art, literature, stories and rituals of an area may be
deeply influenced by the wetland ecosystem in which it is located. See Ramsar Convention
on Wetlands, Ramsar Convention Secretariat, The Cultural Heritage of Wetlands:
Wetlands, An Inspiration in Art, Literature, Music and Folklore. Like the aesthetics of
wetlands, these values are difficult to measure in purely economic terms, but are vital to the
communities. See Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Ramsar Convention Secretariat,
Wetland Ecosystem Services: Cultural Values. As the wetlands disappear, the ties to the
land and many of the stories, rituals and traditions of the communities could disappear as
well.

Questions and Comments
1. If the services that each wetland provides will vary based on the type of wetland and
its size and location, should all wetlands be provided the same level of protection? Are
they provided the same level of protection? Think about those questions as you read
about the standards that the government uses to determine whether to issue a permit
to authorize development in wetlands, the process that the government uses to
determine appropriate mitigation for destruction of wetlands, the manner in which the
government structures its enforcement programs, the analysis that is used to determine
whether government restrictions on wetlands development constitute a taking, and

Definition and Types of Wetlands

A.

Definitions

In general terms, wetlands are “lands where saturation with water is the dominant factor
determining the nature of soil development and the types of plant and animal communities
living in the soil and on its surface.” See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Wetland
Definitions. That description, which appears on the web site of the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), is adapted from a more elaborate definition adopted by the
United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers a National Wetlands Inventory,
as part of its “Cowardin” classification system (named for the scientist who developed it).
The Fish and Wildlife Service definition for wetlands is:
lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is
usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. For purposes of
this classification, wetlands must have one or more of the following three attributes: (1)
at least periodically, the land supports predominantly hydrophytes, (2) the substrate is
predominantly undrained hydric soil, and (3) the substrate is nonsoil and is saturated
with water or covered by shallow water at some time during the growing season of each
year.
See L. Cowardin, et al., U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service,
Classification of Wetlands and Deep-Water Habitats of the United States (1979).
EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have adopted the following conceptually, though not
linguistically, similar definition of wetlands for their regulatory programs:
those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a
frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do
support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
conditions.
See 33 C.F.R. § 328.3 (b) (Corps’ regulations); 40 C.F.R. § 230.3(t) (EPA’s regulations).
Although the Fish and Wildlife Service has developed maps of wetlands as part of its
National Wetlands Inventory, the maps are not designed or intended to be used for legal or
regulatory purposes to identify the existence of, or boundaries of, wetlands. See U.S. Fish
10

and Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory: Frequently Asked Questions. Instead, as
outlined in Part IV of this chapter, both the classification of a specific piece of property as a
wetland and the boundaries of the wetland are determined through a process known as
delineation. The delineation process focuses on whether the property has the soils,
vegetation, and hydrology that are typically found in wetlands.

B.

Types of Wetlands

There are many different ways to categorize or classify wetlands. This section begins by
examining the Cowardin classification system developed by the Fish and Wildlife Service,
takes a closer look at four common types of wetlands, and then focuses on the
Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classification system that categorizes wetlands based on the
values and functions that they provide.

1.

Cowardin classification

Using the Cowardin classification system mentioned above, the Fish and Wildlife Service
identifies the following five types of wetland and deepwater habitat systems:


Marine



Estuarine



Lacustrine



Riverine



Palustrine

Marine systems encompass the open ocean and coastlines, and include coastal lagoons,
rocky shores and coral reefs. See L. Cowardin, et al., U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish
and Wildlife Service, Classification of Wetlands and Deep-Water Habitats of the United
States 4 (1979).
Estuarine systems encompass deepwater habitats “that are usually semi-enclosed by land
but have ... access to the open ocean, and in which ocean water is at least occasionally
diluted by freshwater runoff from the land.” Id. at 4. Estuarine systems include areas such
as deltas, tidal marshes, coastal brackish areas, and mangrove swamps. The marine and
estuarine systems are generally salt water habitats. The other systems are generally fresh
water habitats, although there are some tidal riverine systems.
For wetlands, lacustrine systems generally refer to wetlands associated with lakes and
11

reservoirs. Id. at 9-10. Similarly, the wetlands included within riverine systems are
generally wetlands associated with rivers and streams. Id. at 7-8. However, whether
wetlands in or near rivers, lakes or streams fit within the lacustrine or palustrine categories,
or another category, will depend on the amount of “trees, shrubs, persistent emergents,
emergent mosses or lichens” in the wetlands. Riverine systems do not include wetlands
dominated by those features, and lacustrine systems do not include wetlands where those
features cover more than 30% of the wetlands. Id. at 7-10. Wetlands associated with rivers
and lakes that do not fit within the lacustrine or riverine systems are included with the much
broader final category of wetlands, the palustrine system.
The palustrine system includes “all non-tidal wetlands dominated by trees, shrubs,
persistent emergents, emergent mosses or lichens” and similar wetlands in some tidal
areas. Id. at 10. The system includes marshes, swamps, bogs, fens, and prairies. Id.
Most of the wetland acreage in the United States is within this category. According to a
recent Fish and Wildlife Service report, in 2009, 88% of the wetlands in the
conterminous United States were in the palustrine system. See Stedman, S. & T.E.
Dahl, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries
Service and U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Status and
Trends of Wetlands in the Coastal Watersheds of the Conterminous United States:
2004 to 2009 38 (2013).

2.

Marshes, Swamps, Bogs, and Fens

Within the various wetland and deepwater habitat systems identified above, the most
prevalent types of wetlands are marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens. The differences
between those types of wetlands are described in the following sections.

Marshes
Marshes are wetlands that are characterized by soft stemmed herbaceous plants, such as
cattails and pickerelweed, see Niering, supra, at 21, and are frequently or continually
inundated with water. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Marshes. While some
marshes may be fed by groundwater, marshes usually
receive most of their water from surface water. Id.
Tidal marshes are most prevalent on the east coast
of the United States and along the Gulf of Mexico. Id.
Non-tidal marshes are “the most prevalent and
widely distributed wetlands in North America.” Id. Nontidal marshes are often found in poorly drained
depressions along streams and in the shallow water
along lakes, rivers, and ponds. Id.

12

Included within the category of non-tidal marshes are freshwater marshes, wet
meadows, wet prairies, prairie potholes, vernal pools and playa lakes. Wet meadows
commonly occur in poorly drained areas, resemble grasslands, and are generally drier than
other marshes except during seasonal high water periods. See U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Wet Meadows. They frequently are found in agricultural areas. Id. Wet
prairies are similar to wet meadows, but are wet for longer periods of time. See U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, EPA-843-F-01-002b, Types of Wetlands (Sept. 2001).
Prairie potholes are depressional wetlands that are found most frequently in the upper
midwest. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Prairie Potholes. Many species of
migratory waterfowl rely on these wetlands for breeding and feeding. Id. Vernal pools are
seasonal depressional wetlands found primarily on the west coast and in the glaciated
areas of the northeast and midwest. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Vernal
Pools. They are covered by shallow water during periods of the winter and spring, but may
be dry for the summer and fall. Id. They are usually found in gently sloping grassland
plains and usually overlay bedrock or a layer of hard clay. Id. Playa lakes are round
hollows usually found in the southern high plains and are only present for short periods
during the year. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Playa Lakes.They are vital
because they store water in a region of the country that receives very little rain and has no
permanent rivers or streams. Id.

Swamps
Swamps are wetlands dominated by woody plants,
such as trees and shrubs. See Niering, supra, at 22.
The soils are saturated during the growing season and
standing water is not uncommon during certain times of
the year. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
Swamps. Swamps are generally divided into two types,
forested swamps and shrub swamps, depending on
the vegetation present. Id.
Forested swamps are found throughout the United
States and are frequently inundated with surface water
Photo 8 NPS Photo
from rivers and streams. Id. While they vary by
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:
geographic region, trees typically found in forested
Big_thicket.jpg
wetlands include red maple, white oak and bald
cypress. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA-843-F-01-002b, Types of
Wetlands (Sept. 2001). Forested swamps in the south central United States are generally
referred to as bottomland hardwood swamps.
Shrub swamps are similar to forested swamps and sometime found adjacent to them, but
are dominated by shrub vegetation. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Swamps.
13

They are often found along streams and in floodplains, although there are also tidal shrub
swamps, including mangrove swamps. Id.

Bogs and Fens
Bogs are acidic peatlands, often covered by a blanket of sphagnum moss. See U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, Bogs. They are mostly found in the northeast and the
Great Lakes region (northern bogs), although they can also be found in the southeast
(pocosins) and receive most of their water from precipitation, as opposed to runoff,
groundwater or streams. Id. Large amounts of carbon are stored in the peat deposits in
bogs, so these wetlands play an important role in minimizing and adapting to climate
change. Id.
Fens also are peatlands, but receive water from groundwater as well as precipitation. See
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Fens. Consequently, they are less acidic and have
higher nutrient levels than bogs and can support a greater diversity of plants and animals.
Id.

3.

Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) Classification

The hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classification system is a system developed by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers to classify wetlands and other aquatic systems based on their ability to
perform various functions. The HGM system was originally developed in 1993 as a tool to
classify wetlands based on their location within a landscape (“geomorphic setting” - i.e.,
location on a hillside, in a valley, adjacent to rivers) and their hydrology (based on the
source of the water in the wetland, such as runoff, groundwater or precipitation; the flow
rate of water; and the duration of water in the wetland). See Mark M. Brinson, U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Technical Report WRP-DE-4, A Hydrogeomorphic Classification for
Wetlands (Aug. 1993). It was expanded a few years later to focus on assessing the
functions of wetlands, based on the original HGM classifications. See R. Daniel Smith,
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Technical Report WRP-DE-9, An Approach for Assessing
Wetland Functions Using Hydrogeomorphic Classification, Reference Wetlands, and
Functional Indices (Oct. 1995). The HGM system was originally designed for use in the
Clean Water Act section 404 permit program that the Corps administers, see Chapter 2 of
this book, but, in 1997, most federal agencies that had jurisdiction over wetlands under
various laws agreed to use the HGM system to assess wetland functions. See U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, The National Action Plan to Implement the Hydrogeomorphic
Approach to Assessing Wetland Functions, 62 Fed. Reg. 33607 (June 20, 1997). Pursuant
to that 1997 “National Action Plan,” the Corps of Engineers has developed a series of
regional guidebooks to explain the process for applying the system to various HGM classes
across the United States. See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Guidebooks.
The HGM classification system divides wetlands into the following seven classes:
14









Depressional
Riverine
Mineral Flats (Flats)
Organic Flats (Extensive peatlands)
Tidal Fringe
Lacustrine Fringe
Slopes

See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Hydrogeomorphic Approach for Assessing Wetlands
Functions, Wetland Classifications.
Some of the characteristics of the various types of systems and some of the types of
wetlands included in each system, are identified in the following chart:

HGM Type

Characteristics

Typical Wetlands

Depressional

Located in topographic depressions; Fed
by precipitation, surface water,
groundwater; Water flows toward the
center of the depression; Duration of
wetness varies from ephemeral to
perennial.

Prairie potholes, playa
lakes, and vernal pools

Riverine

Located in floodplains and riparian
corridors associated with stream
channels; Water source is primarily
overbank flow, with some groundwater
and other connections; Water flows out to
the channels during rainfall events and
after flooding.

Bottomland hardwoods

Mineral Flats

Located on slight slopes; Water source is
primarily precipitation; Water moves
slowly out of these wetlands.

Pine flatwoods

Extensive
peatlands

Located on flat interfluves or in locations
where depressions have filled with peat;
water source is primarily precipitation;
Water flows out through overland flow and
seepage to groundwater.

Northern peatlands

15

Tidal Fringe

Located along the coast and in estuaries;
Tidal currents are the predominant water
source, although groundwater and
precipitation may be additional sources;
Bi-directional flow of water between the
wetlands and tides; These wetlands are
seldom dry.

Salt marsh

Lacustrine
Fringe

Usually located adjacent to lakes where
the water table of the lake maintains the
wetland’s water table; Water sources
include the lake, precipitation and
groundwater discharge; Surface water
flow is bi-directional.

Un-impounded
marshes bordering the
Great Lakes

Slopes

Usually located on slight to steep sloping
land; Predominant water source is
groundwater and some precipitation;
Surface water generally flows quickly
downgradient and out of the wetland.

Fens

See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Hydrogeomorphic Approach for Assessing Wetlands
Functions, Wetland Classifications.
Since wetlands in the same HGM category have similar geomorphology (location within a
landscape) and similar hydrology, they will generally perform similar functions. See Dennis
W. Magee, A Primer on Wetland Ecology, Wetlands Law and Policy: Understanding
Section 404 43-49 (Section of Environment, Energy and Resources, American Bar
Association, 2005). For instance, because depressional wetlands trap more water than
some other categories of wetlands, they may provide groundwater recharge functions that
wetlands in other HGM categories, like slope wetlands, may not. Id. at 43-44. Similarly,
because of their hydrology and geomorphology, lacustrine fringe wetlands serve a very
important floodwater storage function, among other functions. Id. at 45-46. Tidal fringe
wetlands can perform significant water quality functions, among other functions. Id. at 4849. Since the wetlands within similar categories perform similar functions, the HGM
classification system tailors assessment tools within each category to determine how well a
specific wetland can perform the functions assessed for that category. Id. at 52-53.

Status and Trends

At the end of the eighteenth century, it is estimated that there were approximately 392
million acres of wetlands in the United States, with 221 million acres in the lower 48 states.
See Dahl, T.E., U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wetlands
Losses in the United States: 1780s to 1980s 1 (1990). By 1980, the Fish and Wildlife
Service concluded that, after a “200 year history of wetland conversion”, wetland acreage in
the lower 48 states had declined by 53% to about 104 million acres. Id. Over that time
period, therefore, about 585,000 acres of wetlands were lost every year. During that time
period, California lost 90% of its wetlands, 10 states (Arkansas, California, Connecticut,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, and Ohio) lost 70% or more of their
wetlands, and 22 states lost at least 50% of their wetlands. Id. at 3-5. Except for Alaska,
Hawaii, and New Hampshire, every other state lost at least 20% of their wetlands during
that time period. Id. An overwhelming percentage of those losses occurred before the
1950s, as a 1983 Fish and Wildlife Service report found that there were 108.1 million acres
of wetlands in the lower 48 states in the 1950s. See U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, Status and Trends of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats in the
Conterminous United States: 1950s to 1970s 3 (Apr. 1983). That report also determined
that the rate of wetland losses between the 1950s and 1970s was 458,000 acres per year.
Id. In a follow-up survey, the Fish and Wildlife Service determined that the rate of wetland
loss has decreased, between the mid-1980s through mid-1990s, to 290,000 acres per year.
Dahl, T.E. & C.E. Johnson, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Conterminous United States: Mid·1970s to Mid·l980s
3 (1991).
The Fish and Wildlife Service has continued to conduct periodic surveys of the status of
wetland acreage in the United States and, in a report issued in 2000, concluded that the
rate of wetland loss declined, during the period from 1986-1997, to 58,500 acres per year,
and that 105.5 million acres of wetlands remained in the conterminous United States in
1997. See Dahl, T.E., U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Conterminous United States: 1986 to 1997 9 (2000).
Ninety-five percent of the remaining wetlands, at that time, were inland freshwater
wetlands, while five percent were estuarine and saltwater wetlands. Id. at 10. Ninety-eight
percent of the wetland losses during the study period were losses to freshwater wetlands.
17

Id. The study suggested that the overall decline in the rate of wetland losses was due to
“implementation and enforcement of wetland protection measures and elimination of some
incentives for wetland drainage,” among other factors. Id. For the first time, that study also
attempted to identify the types of activities that contributed to the wetland losses. Thirty
percent of the wetland losses during the study period were attributed to urban
development, twenty-six percent were attributed to agriculture, twenty three percent to
silviculture, and 21 percent to rural development. Id. at 11. Road construction is a major
factor in wetland conversion, as it often entails the placement of fill material in wetlands and
it opens up previously inaccessible areas, wetland and otherwise, to development. See
Royal C. Gardner, Lawyers, Swamps, and Money 95 (Island Press 2011). To serve a
growing population, energy exploration, including offshore exploration and mountaintop
removal mining, has also grown as a source of wetland destruction. Id. at 96.
In 2005, the Fish and Wildlife Service released a report that found, for the first time, that
wetland acreage in the conterminous United States was increasing. Dahl, T.E., U.S.
Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Status and Trends of Wetlands in
the Conterminous United States: 1998 to 2004 (2005). The study found that there were
107.7 million acres of wetlands in the conterminous United States in 2004, and that wetland
acreage increased by 32,000 acres per year between 1998 and 2004. Id. at 16. The report
suggested that the net gains in wetland acreage were due to “wetlands created, enhanced
or restored through regulatory and nonregulatory restoration programs.” Id. at 16. More
specifically, though, the report indicated that most of the gains during the study period were
due to the restoration and creation of freshwater ponds through agricultural conservation
programs, and that the ponds “would not be expected to provide the same range of wetland
values and functions as a vegetated freshwater wetland.” Id. The authors of the study
indicated, at the outset of the report, that “[o]n Earth Day 2004, President Bush announced
a wetlands initiative that established a federal policy beyond “no net loss” of wetlands,
[which] ... seeks to attain an overall increase in the quality and quantity of wetlands [and
that] ... [t]he President set a goal of restoring, improving and protecting more than 3 million
acres ... in five years.” Id. at 15. The authors indicated that the report provided some data
regarding the progress being made to meet the goals regarding the increase in quantity of
wetlands, but that the report did “not assess the quality or condition of the nation’s
wetlands.” Id. Indeed, none of the previous reports assessed the quality or condition of the
wetlands either. All of the reports focused simply on the quantity of wetland acreage lost.
In the most recent study of wetland status and trends, the Fish and Wildlife Service found
that there was a small, but statistically insignificant, difference between wetland acreage in
the conterminous United States between 2004 and 2009, with overall acreage declining by
62,300 acres (or 13,800 acres per year over the 4.5 year study period).” Dahl, T.E., U.S.
Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Status and Trends of Wetlands in
the Conterminous United States: 2004 to 2009 15-16 (2011). As in several previous
studies, ninety-five percent of the wetlands identified were freshwater wetlands and five
percent were marine or estuarine wetlands. Id. at 16. Freshwater pond acreage continued
18

to grow, although more slowly than in the prior report, and forested wetlands “sustained
their largest losses since the 1974 to 1985 time period.” Id. at 16. While the authors
indicated that the report did not draw conclusions regarding trends in the quality or
condition of wetlands, they wrote, “The cumulative effects of losses in the freshwater
system have had consequences for hydrologic and ecosystem connectivity. In certain
regions, profound reductions in wetland extent have resulted in habitat loss, fragmentation,
and limited opportunities for reestablishment and watershed rehabilitation.” Id.
Although the rate of wetland loss in the conterminous United States may have leveled off,
in some regions, the rate of wetland loss continues to increase. In addition to the reports
that focus on wetland acreage in the conterminous United States, the Fish and Wildlife
Service has partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to
examine wetland trends in coastal watersheds. Significantly, the agencies found that,
during the 1998-2004 time period, the coastal watersheds of the eastern United States lost
about 59,000 acres of wetlands each year, at a time when the Fish and Wildlife Service
study above was indicating that there was an overall net increase of 32,000 acres of
wetlands per year. See Stedman, S. & T.E. Dahl, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service and U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish
and Wildlife Service, Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Coastal Watersheds of the
Eastern United States: 1998 to 2004 5 (2008). In a more recent report, the agencies
concluded that wetland acreage in the coastal watersheds of the United States declined by
360,720 acres between 2004 and 2009, for an average loss of 80,160 acres per year. See
Stedman, S. & T.E. Dahl, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National
Marine Fisheries Service and U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service,
Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Coastal Watersheds of the Conterminous United
States: 2004 to 2009 2 (2013). That represented a 25% increase in the rate of wetland loss
when compared to data for the region between 1998 and 2004. Id. The greatest losses in
acreage are occurring in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic regions, with smaller losses along
the Pacific coast and net gains in the Great Lakes region. Id. at 20. The authors of the
report noted that “wetland reestablishment in coastal watersheds has lagged behind
reestablishment rates observed nationally [and that] ... [a] strategy of achieving “no net
loss” by offsetting wetland acreage losses with wetland creation or reestablishment does
not appear to be effective in the coastal watersheds as wetland losses have increased in
some coastal regions.” Id. at 3.

Questions and Comments
1.

No net loss ...: In 1987, the Conservation Foundation convened a National
Wetlands Policy Forum, which developed a set of consensus recommendations on
protecting and managing wetlands. One of the recommendations was that the
national policy be guided by a goal of “no overall net loss” of the nation’s wetlands
and a long-term goal to increase the quantity and quality of the nation’s wetlands.
See Julie M. Sibbing, National Wildlife Federation, Nowhere Near No Net Loss.
19

President George H.W. Bush endorsed the policy of “no net loss” of wetlands in
1989 and Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush endorsed the policy and
expanded it in their administrations to achieve increases in wetland acreage. Note,
though, that “no net loss” focuses not just on loss of acreage of wetlands, but on
loss of the quality of wetlands - the values and functions. Why have most of the
federal government studies focused solely on wetland acreage? EPA and the Fish
and Wildlife Service are in the process of conducting a National Wetland Condition
Assessment to determine the quality of our nation’s wetlands. See U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, National Wetland Condition Assessment. Will this
tool help the agencies determine whether the quality of the nation’s wetlands has
degraded in the last 50-100 years? The next 50-100 years?
2.

The 2005 Fish and Wildlife report indicated that net wetland acreage in the United
States had increased between 1998 and 2004. Much of the net growth was
attributable to projects to create or restore ponds and other wetlands on agricultural
lands. Should the increase in acreage be viewed as a success? When compared to
the values and functions provided by the wetlands lost? When compared to the
losses of other types of wetlands, such as coastal wetlands, where restoration
projects did not outpace conversion projects?

3.

Mission Accomplished?: In 2008, President George W. Bush released a report
indicating that more than 3.6 million acres of wetlands had been restored, protected
or preserved as part of an initiative that he announced in 2004 to create, improve or
protect at least 3 million acres of wetlands by 2009. See Office of the President,
Council on Environmental Quality, Conserving America’s Wetlands 2008: Four
Years of Progress Implementing the President’s Goal (April 2008). Environmental
groups criticized the report because it did not quantify wetland losses during the
corresponding period, or indicate whether the actions resulted in any net gain of
acreage, let alone values or functions.

4.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), within the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, also collects and analyzes data relating to wetland acreage as part of
its National Resources Inventory. See U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural
Resources Conservation Service, National Resources Inventory. It relies on the
same classification system for wetlands as the Fish and Wildlife Service, but the
study only examines resources on non-federal land in the conterminous United
States. See U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service, 2007 Natural Resources Inventory: Wetlands 1 (2013). In addition, the
study periods are different from the study periods used by the Fish and Wildlife
Service. Id. Consequently, it is difficult to compare the data from the NRCS and
FWS studies. NRCS did, however, find net increases in wetland acreage between
1997 and 2002, and between 2002 and 2007. Id. at 5.

20

5.

It is estimated that 75% of the remaining wetlands in the lower 48 states are on
private lands. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Wetlands Protection:
Partnering with Land Trusts. What impacts might that have for regulatory and
legislative policy-making?

IV.

Wetland Delineation

While Part II of this chapter focused on the classification systems that are used to
categorize wetlands, this part examines the “delineation” process that is used to determine
whether property is a wetland and to determine the physical boundaries of wetlands. With
the exception of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the federal agencies that
regulate wetlands follow procedures in a 1987 technical manual developed by the Army
Corps of Engineers to delineate wetlands. See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wetlands
Research Technical Report Y-87-1, Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual
(1987) [hereinafter “1987 Corps Delineation Manual”].
The agencies focus on three characteristics of wetlands to determine whether property is a
wetland - vegetation, soils and hydrology. Id. ¶ 26(b). Except when an area has been
altered or in a few other unusual circumstances, positive indicators of all three
characteristics must be present for an area to be delineated as a wetland. Id. ¶ 26(c). Thus,
an area that has wetland vegetation and wetland hydrology, but not wetland soils, will
normally not be a wetland. Since vegetation, soils and hydrology differ throughout the
country, the Corps has also developed supplements to the 1987 delineation manual that
provide guidance on delineating wetlands in 10 different geographic regions. See U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Regional Supplements to the Corps Delineation Manual.
Vegetation
Wetlands are areas where the prevalent vegetation is hydrophytic vegetation (species that
have the ability to grow, effectively compete, reproduce and/or persist in anaerobic soil
conditions). See 1987 Corps Delineation Manual ¶¶ 26(b)(1). The Fish and Wildlife Service
publishes a list of hydrophytic vegetation that is used in making this determination. See
U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2014 National Wetland
Plant List. Generally, this criterion is met if more than 50% of the dominant plant species in
the area are hydrophytic (categorized as obligate wetland plants, facultative wetland plants
or facultative plants on the National Wetland Plant list). See 1987 Corps Delineation
Manual ¶¶ 35(a). In addition, identification of trees with shallow root systems, swollen
trunks or roots growing from the plant stem or trunk above the soil surface may sometimes
indicate that the vegetation criterion is satisfied. See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Recognizing Wetlands.

21

Soils
Areas meet the criterion for wetland soils if the soils in the area are
hydric soils (i.e., “have characteristics that indicate that they were
developed in conditions where soil oxygen is limited by the presence of
saturated soil for long periods during the growing season.”) See U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Recognizing Wetlands. The Natural
Resources Conservation Service maintains a list of hydric soils, see U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service,
Soil Taxonomy (2d ed. 1999), and soil types can usually be identified by
comparing soil colors at various depths to soil charts. See Munsell Color,
Munsell Soil Color Charts. Since hydric soils can

_Nebraska_(5167)(NRCS_Photo_Gallery).jpg
exhibits wetland hydrology or vegetation,
though, soils are considered less reliable
indicators than the other two criterion. See Mark A. Chertok & Kate Sinding, Federal
Jurisdiction over Wetlands: “Waters of the United States”, in Wetlands Law and Policy 87
(Section of Environment, Energy and Resources, American Bar Association, 2005).
Hydrology
Areas meet the criterion for hydrology if they “are periodically inundated or have soils
saturated to the surface at some time during the growing season.” See 1987 Corps
Delineation Manual ¶¶ 46. The Corps provides the following helpful definition in an
information pamphlet on recognizing wetlands, “wetland hydrology refers to the presence of
water at or above the soil surface for a sufficient period of the year to significantly influence
the plant types and soils that occur in the area.” See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Recognizing Wetlands. Normally, areas must be inundated for at least a week during the
growing season to meet the hydrology criterion. See Chertok & Sinding, supra, at 87.
Inundation or saturation can be demonstrated by visual observation or recorded data, such
as stream gage data, lake gage data, flood predictions and historical data. See 1987 Corps
Delineation Manual ¶¶ 49. In addition to those methods, the hydrology criterion may be
satisfied through observation of drift lines, sediment deposits, drainage patterns, or
watermarks on vegetation. Id. Many of those indicators, though, do not reveal the
frequency, timing or duration of flooding or the soil saturation. See U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, Recognizing Wetlands. While hydrology “is often the least exact” of the criterion,
“it is essential to establish that a wetland area is periodically inundated or has saturated
soils during the growing season.” See 1987 Corps Delineation Manual ¶¶ 46.

Research Problems
1. Agency Reports: While federal law requires agencies to publish rules and various
adjudicative decisions and guidance documents in the Federal Register, see Chapter
3, infra, agencies are generally not required to publish reports that they produce in any
specific format. However, most agencies make significant reports that they produce
available on the agency’s website. See if you can locate a report issued by the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service entitled “Status and Trends of Wetlands in the
Coastal Watersheds of the Conterminous United States 2004 to 2009". According to
the report, in 2009, there were an estimated 41.1 million acres of wetlands in the
coastal watersheds of the United States.

in the Federal Register, most are not. However, agencies publish frequently requested

the agency’s website, interested persons normally have to contact the agency to
request a copy of the guidance document (if they know that the guidance document
exists). See if you can locate the Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers

Chapter 2
The History of Regulation
I.

Early Development Laws

Sentiments toward wetlands have evolved significantly over
the history of our nation, and wetlands laws have evolved
significantly as well. For much of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, public sentiment and legislation favored the draining
and conversion of wetlands. They were long considered
“insect-ridden, unattractive, and dangerous” places. See
William A. Niering, Wetlands 19 (Chanticleer Press, 1985). In
1732, William Byrd II, the founder of Richmond, Virginia,
described the Great Dismal Swamp (now a national wildlife
refuge) as “a vast body of mire and nastiness.” See U.S.
Department of Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, The
Great Dismal Swamp and the Underground Railroad. Thirty
years later, George Washington joined several partners to form
“Adventurers for Draining the Dismal Swamp” and the Virginia Photo 10 USFWS Photo by S.
General Assembly authorized their company to harvest the Bournique
timber and drain much of the swamp, which extended over http://commons.wikimedia.or
2,000 square miles at the time. See The Diaries of George g/wiki/File:Great_dismal_swa
Washington, Vol. 1: 11 March 1748 – 13 November 1765, at mp.jpg
319-320 (ed. Donald Jackson. Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1976).
To the extent that Congress legislated in the area of natural resources in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, laws such as the Homestead Act of 1862, Act of May 20, 1862,
Pub. L. 37-62, 12 Stat. 392 (which required the “improvement” of homesteads), and the
General Mining Act of 1872, 30 U.S.C. §§ 22-47, focused on encouraging the settlement of
the country and the exploitation of natural resources, as opposed to protecting and
conserving resources. Federal laws regarding wetlands at the time were no different. The
Swamp Wetland Act of 1849, 9 Stat. 352 (1849), granted to Louisiana all of the swamp
lands in the State that were not suitable for cultivation, so that the State could build levees
and drains to “reclaim” the wetlands. See Shaw, Samuel P. and C. Gordon Fredine, U.S.
Department of the Interior, Circular 39 Wetlands of the United States - Their Extent and
Their Value to Waterfowl and Other Wildlife (1956) [hereinafter “USGS, Wetlands of the
United States”]. The Swamp Wetland Act of 1850, 9 Stat. 519 (1850), granted the swamp
lands in 12 other states (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
25

Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin) to those states for similar purposes.
See USGS, Wetlands of the United States. In 1860, Congress extended the provisions of
those laws to cover the wetlands in Minnesota and Oregon. Id. Through those laws, almost
65 million acres of wetlands were given to the States. Id. The States sold or gave away
most of those wetlands to local governments or developers, and now most are in private
hands. Id. Most of the wetlands that were destroyed over the first two centuries of our
nation were converted to agricultural lands, usually by private landowners. See National
Research Council. Wetlands: Characteristics and Boundaries 17 (Washington, DC: The
National Academies Press, 1995).
At the end of the nineteenth century, Congress passed the Rivers and Harbors
Appropriations Act of 1899, see 33 U.S.C. § 401, et. seq., a law that would eventually
play a role in limiting the destruction and conversion of wetlands. See Chapters 4 and 6,
infra. However, the primary focus of that law is on protecting the navigability of the nation’s
waters and protecting interstate commerce, which is often accomplished through dredging
or the construction of channels. While the law includes provisions that limit obstructions in
navigable waters, see 33 U.S.C. § 403, and prohibits the deposit of refuse in navigable
waters, see 33 U.S.C. § 407, it was almost three quarters of a century after the law was
enacted before courts upheld the government’s authority to prohibit obstruction activities in
wetlands for environmental reasons under the law. See Zabel v. Tabb, 430 F.2d 199 (5th
Cir. 1970). Thus, at the time, enactment of the law did not signal a significant shift in the
congressional policy or attitude toward wetlands.
The prevailing sentiment towards wetlands at the turn of the twentieth century was probably
expressed most clearly in the Supreme Court’s 1900 decision in Leovy v. United States,
when Justice Shiras, for the Court, wrote:
If there is any fact which may be supposed to be known by everybody, and therefore
by courts, it is that swamps and stagnant waters are the cause of malarial and
malignant fevers, and that the police power is never more legitimately exercised than in
removing such nuisances.
177 U.S. 621, 636 (1900). The Court also noted that converting the wetlands in the case to
agricultural use increased the value of the land from $5,000 to $100,000 and could possibly
increase the value to $300,000. Id. at 627.

II.

A Slow Shift to Conservation

Although large segments of the public and policymakers adopted views similar to those
expressed by the Court, the turn of the twentieth century also witnessed the birth of a
national conservation movement. In 1903, by Executive Order, President Theodore
Roosevelt established the country’s first National Wildlife Refuge, Pelican Island National
26

Wildlife Refuge, in south Florida. See U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, Short History of the Refuge System: The Early Years (1864-1920). While the
Pelican Island Refuge was the first National Wildlife Refuge, federal and state governments
and private organizations had already begun to acquire wetlands to establish wildlife
sanctuaries in the late nineteenth century. See National Research Council. Wetlands:
Characteristics and Boundaries 45 (Washington, DC: The National Academies Press,
1995). In the six years after he established the Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge,
President Roosevelt issued 51 additional Executive Orders that established wildlife
reservations in 17 States. Id. As it approached its centennial, the National Wildlife Refuge
System included more than 520 units in all 50 states, covering 93 million acres of wildlife
habitat. See U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Short History of
the Refuge System: Approaching the Centennial (1997 and On). For an in-depth history of
the National Wildlife Refuge System, see Robert L. Fischman, The National Wildlife Refuge
System and the Hallmarks of Modern Organic Legislation, 29 Ecology L. Quarterly 457
(2002).
A few years after President Roosevelt left office, in 1913, Congress enacted the WeeksMcLean Act, Ch. 145, 37 Stat. 828, 847 (1913), to prohibit the commercial hunting and
shipment of migratory birds across state lines. The law, which was enacted as a rider to
appropriations legislation, was held unconstitutional as violating the Tenth Amendment, but
was replaced a few years later by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, 16 U.S.C. § 703,
et seq., which prohibits hunting, capturing, possessing, selling and many other activities
with regard to migratory birds that are protected by an international migratory bird treaty.
Although those laws were not enacted to provide protection to wetlands, they demonstrated
Congress’ concern with protecting migratory birds, and that concern would eventually lead
to further legislation to protect the habitat, including wetlands habitat, of those birds.
Two of the earliest federal wetland conservation
laws were the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of
1929, 16 U.S.C. §§ 715-715d, 715e, 715f-715r,
which authorized, but did not permanently fund, the
acquisition and preservation of wetlands as habitat
for waterfowl, and the Migratory Bird Hunting
Stamp Act of 1934, 16 U.S.C. §§ 718 - 718j
(generally referred to as “The Duck Stamp Act”),
which created a funding source for the wetlands
conservation authorized by the 1929 law. See U.S.
Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, Federal Duck Stamp Office, What Are Duck
Photo 11 Public Domain Photo
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File: Stamps? Duck Stamps are pictorial stamps that are
Duck_stamp.jpg
produced by the Fish and Wildlife Service which
were originally created as federal licenses to hunt migratory waterfowl. Id. Today, Duck
Stamps also serve as entry passes to National Wildlife Refuges and many people buy Duck
27

Stamps simply to promote wetland conservation, as ninety-eight cents out of every dollar
from the sale of Duck stamps is used to purchase or lease wetland habitat for National
Wildlife Refuges. Id. Since 1934, the Fish and Wildlife Service has raised more than 800
million dollars from the sale of Duck Stamps and has purchased or leased more than 6
million acres of wetlands with those proceeds. Id.
Although Congress created the Duck Stamp program in 1934 to fund federal acquisition
and protection of wetlands, between 1940 and 1977, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
provided technical information and cost-sharing, through its Agricultural Conservation
Program, to assist landowners in draining wetlands. See U.S. Congress, Office of
Technology Assessment, OTA-O-206, Wetlands: Their Use and Regulation 77 (Mar. 1984).

III.

Towards Comprehensive Federal Regulation

As was the case with most environmental issues, though, federal regulatory involvement in
wetlands protection grew during the end of the 1960s and throughout the 1970s. At first,
Congress and the Corps strengthened the wetland protections in the Rivers and Harbors
Act. In 1965, Congress amended the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act to require
agencies to consider opportunities for fish and wildlife enhancement when planning any
navigation, flood control, reclamation, hydroelectric or multipurpose water resource project.
See Pub. L. 89-72, 79 Stat. 213 (1965). After that, the Corps entered into an agreement
with the Fish and Wildlife Service to consult on projects that the Corps would review for
authorization under the Rivers and Harbors Act. See Memorandum of Understanding
Between the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army (July 13, 1967).
Around the same time, the Corps adopted regulations to incorporate a “public interest”
review, including a focus on environmental factors, into the Rivers and Harbors Act
permitting program. See 33 Fed. Reg. 18670 (Dec. 18, 1968). While these changes
provided some additional protection for wetlands, the Rivers and Harbors Act only
regulates activities in waters that are, were historically, or could potentially be, navigable,
see Chapter 4, infra, so the Corps’ jurisdiction over wetlands under the Act is fairly narrow.
Instead, most federal regulation of wetlands derives from the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. 92-500, 86 Stat. 816 (1972), which, after
subsequent amendments, is commonly known as the Clean Water Act. The statute
prohibits the addition of pollutants into navigable waters, a term that has been interpreted
by the government and courts to include wetlands. See Chapter 4, infra. However, Section
404 of the statute authorizes the Corps of Engineers to issue permits to authorize the
discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344. While the
Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act play a role in
protecting wetlands, as discussed later, the Clean Water Act Section 404 permitting
program is the primary federal tool for regulating and protecting wetlands and most of this
book focuses on that program. Although the statute authorizes the Corps to issue the
permits, Congress gave EPA the authority, with the Corps, to develop the guidelines that
28

the Corps uses to determine whether to issue the permits. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(b)(1). The
statute also authorizes EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service to comment on permit
applications, and authorizes EPA to veto Section 404 permits. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(c).
The division of authority between EPA and the Corps has created some tension over the
years.
In the first few years after Congress created the Section 404 permit program, the Corps of
Engineers interpreted the Clean Water Act narrowly to provide limited jurisdiction over
wetlands. See Chapter 4, infra. By 1975, however, the Corps had adopted a more
expansive reading of the statute. Id. Since those early years of the Section 404 program,
several Presidents have issued Executive Orders, adopted action plans or announced
policies to expand protection of wetlands.
In 1977, President Carter issued Executive Order 11990, which required federal agencies
to “take action to minimize the destruction, loss or degradation of wetlands, and to preserve
and enhance the natural and beneficial values of wetlands.” See Executive Order 11990,
Protection of Wetlands § 1 (May 24, 1977). Significantly, the order also required agencies
to “avoid undertaking or providing assistance for new construction located in wetlands
unless the ... agency finds (1) that there is no practicable alternative to such construction,
and (2) that the proposed action includes all practicable measures to minimize harm to
wetlands which may result from such use.” Id. § 2. A little over a decade later, in 1988,
President George H.W. Bush endorsed a policy, which was developed by a National
Wetlands Policy Forum, of “no net loss” of wetlands. See Julie M. Sibbing, National Wildlife
Federation, Nowhere Near No Net Loss. After President Clinton took office, through a 1993
Interagency Wetlands Plan, he reaffirmed the “no net loss” policy as an interim goal and
called for an increase in the quality and quantity of the nation’s wetlands as a long term
goal. See White House Office on Environmental Policy, Protecting America’s Wetlands: A
Fair, Flexible, and Effective Approach (Aug. 24, 1993). A decade after that, on Earth Day,
2004, President George W. Bush announced a Strategy to Increase Wetland Acres and
Quality, which focused on moving from a “no net loss” policy to an increase in wetland
acres and quality. See The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, Wetlands Initiative
Announced on Earth Day (April 22, 2004).

For several decades, the National Wetlands Inventory has played an important role in
providing information about whether the “no net loss” goal is being met, at least with regard
to wetland acreage. The Fish and Wildlife Service began work on the national inventory of
wetlands in 1974 “to provide biologists and others with information on the distribution and
type of wetlands and to aid in conservation efforts.” See U.S. Department of the Interior,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, NWI Overview. The agency developed the Cowardin
wetland classification system described in Chapter 1, supra, to classify wetlands for the
inventory. Id. While wetlands in the National Wetlands Inventory were originally plotted on
paper maps, the wetlands data in the inventory is now accessible and searchable online in
digital maps. Id. The data are also used to prepare the Service’s periodic reports on
wetland status and trends discussed in Chapter 1. Id. Congress required the agency to
prepare those periodic reports as part of the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of
1986, 16 U.S.C. §§ 3901-3932.

IV.

Conservation Programs and Agricultural Programs

While the Clean Water Act Section 404 program ushered in an era of comprehensive
federal regulation, the federal government also provides protection for wetlands through a
30

variety of economic incentive programs. Some of the programs have been in place for
several decades. For instance, in 1965, Congress passed the Land and Water
Conservation Fund Act of 1965, creating a Land and Water Conservation Fund, which
provides money to federal, state and local governments to purchase property, including
wetlands, for conservation and to fund conservation projects. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 4601-4 4601-11. Through 2014, the Fund provided $4 billion in grants to States to fund more than
42,000 conservation projects. See Land and Water Conservation Fund Coalition, 50 Years
of Conserving America the Beautiful 6 (2014).
In 1970, Congress passed the Water Bank Act, which authorizes the Departments of
Agriculture and Interior to enter into 10 year contracts with landowners to preserve
wetlands on their land and protect wildlife habitat. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 1301-1311. In return,
the landowners receive annual payments over the contract period. Id. In Fiscal Year 2012,
Congress appropriated $7.5 million to fund the Water Bank Program. See U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Water Bank Program.
From those modest beginnings, Congress greatly expanded the number and scope of
federal programs that provide economic incentives for wetland protection shortly after the
release of a report by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (“OTA”) that
identified several federal laws and programs that impeded wetlands protection. See U.S.
Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, OTA-O-206, Wetlands: Their Use and
Regulation 78 (Mar. 1984). The report noted that the Federal tax code provided numerous
deductions that gave farmers incentives to clear and drain wetlands for agricultural use. Id.
The report also concluded that several other federal programs, including cost sharing and
technical assistance in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Conservation
Program, Farmers Home Administration Loans, Federal disaster payments and crop
insurance, and commodity programs provided incentives to farmers to clear and drain
wetlands. Id. at 78-81.
In 1985, the year after the OTA report, Congress included several important provisions in
the Food Security Act of 1985 (also known as the 1985 Farm Bill) to protect wetlands. See
Pub. L. 99-198, 99 Stat. 1509 (1985). The law created a Conservation Reserve Program,
which provides yearly rental payments to farmers (owners of highly erodible cropland) who
agree to remove their land from agricultural production for 10 - 15 years and to plant
vegetation that will improve the environmental health and quality of their land. Id. § 1231.
The program is administered by the Farm Service Agency within the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. See U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, Conservation
Programs: Conservation Reserve Program. Since 1988, restoration of cropped wetlands is
one of the activities that is eligible for program participation. Although the original law
authorized enrollment of up to 45 million acres of highly erodible land in the reserve, that
limit was reduced to 39 million acres in the 2002 Farm Bill and 32 million acres in the 2008
Farm Bill. The program provides about $2 billion to farmers each year and, as of 2012, the
program restored over 2 million acres of wetlands and reduced soil erosion by more than
31

300 million tons per year. See U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, The
Conservation Reserve Program: 45th Signup Results (Sept. 2013).
Perhaps the more significant provisions in the 1985 Farm Bill, though, were the
Swampbuster provisions. Congress included provisions in the law that disqualified farmers
from receiving all or a portion of Federal farm program benefits, including loans, subsidies,
crop insurance, and price supports, if they produced agricultural commodities on converted
wetlands. See 16 U.S.C. § 3821. The Swampbuster provisions were strengthened in the
Food Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 (also known as the 1990 Farm Bill),
which disqualifies farmers from receiving those benefits if they convert wetlands for the
purpose of, or with the effect of, making production of agricultural commodities on them
possible. See 16 U.S.C. § 3821(c). As noted in Chapters 1, supra, and 4, infra, the Natural
Resources Conservation Service delineates wetlands for purposes of the Swampbuster
provisions, see 28 U.S.C. § 3822, and uses a different delineation manual than the manual
used by the Corps of Engineers, EPA and the Department of Interior. While the Natural
Resources Conservation Service and the Farm Service Agency administer the
Swampbuster provisions, the Fish and Wildlife Service, within the Department of Interior,
provides technical assistance to those agencies, and their relationship in administering the
law is outlined in a 2002 Memorandum of Understanding. See U.S. Department of
Agriculture and U.S. Department of Interior, Memorandum of Understanding Regarding
Implementation of the 2002 Farm Bill Conservation Provisions (Aug. 6, 2002).
Subsequent farm bills created additional wetland conservation programs. For instance, the
1990 Farm Bill created the Wetlands Reserve Program, which provided money and
technical assistance to farmers and other landowners to protect, enhance and restore
wetlands on their property. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 3837 - 3837f. Landowners could enroll in the
program by placing a permanent conservation easement or a 30 year conservation
easement on their property, in which case they were fully or partially (for the 30 year
easement) compensated for the value of the easement and received funding to cover the
restoration costs. Id. § 3837a. If the landowners did not prefer to place a conservation
easement on their property, they could still enroll their land in the program, but they only
received funding to cover the restoration costs. Id. In the first twenty years of the program,
which was administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), more
than 11,000 landowners participated, enrolling more than 2.3 million acres of wetlands. See
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Restoring
America’s Wetlands: A Private Lands Conservation Success Story. The program was
replaced, in the 2014 Farm Bill, by an Agricultural Conservation Easement Program,
also administered by NRCS, which includes a Wetland Reserve Easement program and an
Agricultural Land Easement program. In the Wetland Reserve Easement program,
landowners place permanent easements, 30 year easements, or shorter term easements
on wetlands in exchange for compensation for the easement and funding to cover wetland
restoration costs. Id.

32

The Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (the 1996 Farm Bill or
Freedom to Farm Act) created the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program (WHIP) and the
Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP), both of which are administered by the
Natural Resources Conservation Service. See Pub. L. 104-127, 100 Stat. 888 (1996). The
Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program provided funding and technical assistance to landowners
to develop wildlife habitat on private agricultural land, nonindustrial private forest land, and
tribal lands, see 16 U.S.C. 3839bb-1, but was not re-authorized when Congress enacted
the 2014 Farm Bill. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program provides financial and
technical assistance to agricultural producers to plan and implement conservation practices
and related projects. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 3839aa - 3839aa-9. Landowners sign contracts for
a term between one and ten years. Id. § 3839aa-2.
Congress has also created other wetland conservation programs independent of farm bills.
For instance, the North American Wetlands Conservation Act of 1989 created a
program to provide matching grants to organizations and individuals who are partnering to
carry out wetlands conservation projects in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada. See 16 U.S.C. §§
4401 - 4414. Between 1990 and September, 2013, the program provided about $1.8 billion
to more than 5,000 partners, who contributed about $2.68 billion in matching funds,
affecting more than 27.5 million acres of habitat. See U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Bird Habitat Conservation, North American Wetlands
Conservation Act. Congress created another wetlands conservation grant program in the
Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act of 1990. The National Coastal
Wetlands Conservation Grant Program is administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service
and provides grants to States and Territories to protect, restore, and enhance coastal
habitats. See 16 U.S.C. §§ 3951 - 3956. From the time the program was created through
early 2013, about $183 million in grants were awarded to 25 States and one U.S. territory
to acquire, restore or protect 250,000 acres of coastal wetland ecosystems. See U.S.
Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Coastal Wetlands
Conservation Grant Program. Finally, in 2006, Congress passed the Partners for Fish and
Wildlife Act, which creates a program to provide financial and technical assistance to
landowners and Tribes for projects in a variety of habitats to conserve or restore
vegetation, hydrology and soils associated with imperiled ecosystems, including bottomland
hardwoods, marshes, rivers, streams and a variety of other habitats, including ecosystems
that provide habitat for a rare, declining or protected species. See U.S. Department of the
Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. Between
1987 and 2010, the program restored and enhanced over 1 million acres of wetlands. See
U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Partners for Fish and
Wildlife Program: Regional Showcase Accomplishments: Fiscal Year 2010 at 2.

Questions and Comments
1.

Multiple agencies: Why do you think that Congress divided responsibility for
administration of the Section 404 permit program between the Corps of Engineers
and EPA in the manner that it did? What expertise and historical regulatory
authority did each have with regard to wetlands and water pollution? Does having
regulation divided between the Corps and the EPA make effective regulation more
difficult? Should only one agency have authority over regulation? Which one? See
Alyson C. Flournoy, Section 404 at Thirty-Something: A Program in Search of a
Policy, 55 Ala. L. Rev. 607 (2004); Sam Kalen, Commerce to Conservation: The Call
for a National Water Policy and the Evolution of Federal Jurisdiction Over Wetlands,
69 N.D. L. Rev. 873 (1994); Michael C. Blumm and D. Bernard Zaleha, Federal
Wetlands Protection Under the Clean Water Act: Regulatory Ambivalence,
Intergovernmental Tension , and a Call for Reform, 60 U. Colo. L. Rev. 695 (1989).
This division has created some tension, as will be explored in the chapters in this
book that address jurisdiction over waters of the United States, delineation,
mitigation, and the EPA veto process, among others.

2.

Access to information: The Department of Interior and the Department of
Agriculture provide Internet access to significant amounts of data regarding their
wetlands programs. For instance, the Department of Interior provides a user-friendly
mapping interface for its National Wetlands Inventory and convenient access to
information about grants provided through the Land and Water Conservation Fund.
Who are some of the audiences that might use that information and how could it be
used? To familiarize yourself with the tools, (a) find the wetlands that are located
near you and identify the type of wetlands; (b) find the most recent grant awarded by
the Land and Water Conservation Fund to a project in your community.

3.

Swampbuster exemptions: Although the Food Security Act disqualifies farmers
from receiving various federal farm benefits or participating in various federal farm
programs if they produce agricultural commodities on converted wetlands, the
statute includes a grandfather provision that allows farming on wetlands that were
35

converted (or the conversion was commenced) to cropland prior to December 23,
1985 (the date of enactment of the law) as long as the wetlands did not exhibit
wetlands characteristics after the conversion. 16 U.S.C. § 3822(b)(1)(A). The
exemption applies even if the converted cropland once again exhibits wetland
characteristics due to various reasons outlined in the statute. Id. § 3822(b)(1)(G).
The statute or agency regulations also exempt farmers from disqualification for
farming artificial wetlands, farming that does not destroy natural wetland
characteristics or that has a minimal effect on wetland functions and values in the
area, or farming where the farmer has acted in good faith and without intent to
violate the law. Id. § 3822.
4.

Voluntary programs: What are some of the limitations to the effectiveness of
voluntary economic incentive programs as a tool to conserve and protect wetlands?
Is there a national plan or are there regional plans that identify the ecosystems and
resources to protect under the voluntary programs? Who determines which wetlands
and resources should be protected, and on what criteria? How much wetland
acreage can be protected under the programs? What factors limit the amount of
acreage? Where does the money to protect the wetlands come from? Are there
advantages to conservation easements over rental payments and cost sharing?
Advantages to loans versus grants? Is there strong federal oversight of the projects?
Several years ago, EPA’s National Center for Environmental Economics prepared a
comprehensive report on various environmental economic incentive programs. See
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA-240-R-01-001, The United States
Experience with Economic Incentives for Protecting the Environment (Jan. 2001).

5.

The Clean Water Act Section 404 program is unusual in the sense that federal
environmental laws tend to avoid imposing mandates or restrictions on individual
behavior, although many environmental problems, such as climate change, are
caused primarily by individual lifestyle choices. See Stephen M. Johnson, Is Religion
the Environment’s Last Best Hope?: Targeting Change in Individual Behavior
Through Personal Norm Activation, 24 J. Envtl. L. & Litig. 119 (2009); Michael P.
Vandenbergh, From Smokestack to SUV: The Individual as Regulated Entity in the
New Era of Environmental Law, 57 Vand. L. Rev. 515 (2004). One of the reasons
that direct regulation of individual behavior frequently generates public opposition is
that direct regulation makes the costs of the regulation more transparent than
indirect regulation. See Katrina Fischer Kuh, When Government Intrudes:
Regulating Individual Behaviors That Harm the Environment, 61 Duke L. J. 1111
(2012). While Professor Kuh reports that customer service surveys of Section 404
permit applicants do not generally reveal animosity or opposition to the program,
she acknowledges that the permitting requirement can generate opposition in
specific cases because (1) it imposes burdens on the applicant that create benefits
for the public; and (2) it involves federal regulation of land use, a traditionally local
activity. Id. at 1142-1143.
36

6.

A program in flux: As you read this book, focusing on issues such as the
delineation of wetlands, federal jurisdiction over waters of the United States, the
divided responsibility of the Corps and EPA, and the implementation of
compensatory mitigation requirements, consider the following quote by Professor
Alyson Flournoy: “A review of the section 404 program’s evolution ... reveals a
program (and agency) perpetually in flux with a poorly defined goal.” See Alyson C.
Flournoy, Section 404 at Thirty-Something: A Program in Search of a Policy, 55 Ala.
L. Rev. 607, 608 (2004). Is there a need for a different federal law to protect
wetlands? What might be done differently?

V.

International Wetlands Protection - U.S. Role

In 1971, 18 nations reached agreement on the terms of a treaty that committed the nations
to identify and protect “Wetlands of International Importance” and to plan for the “wise use”
(sustainable use) of all their wetlands. See Convention on Wetlands of International
Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat, Feb. 2, 1971, T.I.A.S. No. 1084, 996 U.N.T.S.
245 (amended 1982 & 1987). The Ramsar Convention, named for the city in Iran that
hosted the negotiations, came into force in 1975. See The Ramsar Convention on
Wetlands, A Brief History of the Ramsar Convention. As of October, 2014, 168 nations
signed on to the Convention. See The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Country Profiles.
The United States joined in 1987. Id. Two years later, Congress passed the North
American Wetlands Conservation Act of 1989, mentioned in the last section, to partially
implement the convention in the United States. Pursuant to the terms of the Ramsar
Convention, the Fish and Wildlife Service adopted a “Policy on Wetlands of International
Importance” in 1990. See 55 Fed. Reg. 13856 (Apr. 12, 1990). As of February, 2014, 36
sites in the United States were designated as wetlands of international importance. See
The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, The Annotated Ramsar List: United States.

Research Problems
International Materials: International materials can be very difficult to locate, but the Ramsar Convention
website includes the governing documents and many other useful wetlands resources, including a site
database. See if you can answer the following questions after browsing through their website: (1) Which
wetlands were the first wetlands in the United States to be included on the Ramsar List of Wetlands of
International Importance? (2) In what year were they added to the list? (3) Which wetlands on the List of
Wetlands of International Importance are located closest to your home? Sounds like a good field trip
opportunity. February 2 is World Wetlands Day.

The Agencies That Regulate Wetlands

Although there are hundreds of agencies at the federal, state and local level that play some
role in the regulation or protection of wetlands, the four primary federal agencies that are
involved in wetlands protection are the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (within the U.S.
Department of Defense), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (within the U.S. Department of Interior) and the Natural Resources
Conservation Agency (within the U.S. Department of Agriculture).
A.

Corps of Engineers

The Corps of Engineers is part of the Department of the Army, within the Department of
Defense. The Corps’ military leader, the Chief of Engineers, a three star general, reports
directly to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. See Melissa Samet,
American Rivers & National Wildlife Federation, A Citizens Guide to the Corps of Engineers
10 (2009). The Corps has primary authority for issuing Section 404 permits, including both
individual permits and general permits, and is responsible for the day to day administration
of the permit program. The Corps also administers the Section 10 Rivers and Harbors Act
permitting program. Both permitting programs are part of the Department of the Army
Regulatory Program.
The Corps’ headquarters is located in Washington, D.C., and the agency is divided
regionally into 9 Divisions, each of which is commanded by a Division Engineer. There are
43 Districts within the 9 Divisions, each of which is commanded by a District Engineer.
Although regulations and general program policies are developed at the headquarters level,
other aspects of the Corps’ regulatory program are very decentralized, with most permitting
and enforcement decisions being made on a regional level. For instance, final agency
decisions on most administrative appeals are made by the Division Engineers. See 33
C.F.R. § 331. General permits may also be issued on a regional basis, as well as national
basis. See Chapter 6, infra.

A map of the Corps’ Divisions and Districts is included below:

38

Photo 13 Corps of Engineers Map from http://www.usace.army.mil/Locations.aspx

For more information about the Corps, American Rivers and the National
Wildlife Federation have prepared a useful guide to the history and structure
of the agency and its programs. See Melissa Samet, American Rivers &
National Wildlife Federation, A Citizens Guide to the Corps of Engineers 10
(2009).
B.
Environmental Protection Agency
The Environmental Protection Agency is an independent agency within the Executive
Branch and it administers most of the nation’s environmental laws. For wetlands, EPA
developed the guidelines that are used to evaluate Section 404 permits, the agency
reviews and comments on the permits, and it can veto permits. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(c).
EPA also shares wetlands enforcement authority with the Corps. See Chapter 10, infra.
EPA is headed by an Administrator and has its headquarters in Washington, D.C. See U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, About EPA. The agency is divided into ten regions, each
39

of which is headed by a Regional Administrator. Development of regulations and national
policies on wetlands takes place in the Office of Water, within EPA’s headquarters in
Washington. However, daily administration of the agency’s responsibilities related to
permitting and enforcement under the 404 program takes place in the regions, in
coordination with headquarters. Unlike the Corps, though, EPA’s administrative appeals are
handled by an Environmental Appeals Board, headquartered in Washington. In the event
that there are disputes between EPA and the Corps regarding individual permits, EPA’s
Assistant Administrator for Water (head of the Office of Water), makes final decisions
regarding permit vetoes. A map of EPA’s regional office structure is included below:

Photo 14 EPA Map from http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/visiting-regional-office

C.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is an agency within the Department of the Interior (DOI).
The agency is headed by a Director, who reports to the Assistant Secretary for Fish,
Wildlife and Parks in DOI, and it is divided into 8 regions. See U.S. Department of the
Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Our Regions. The agency reviews and comments
on Section 404 permits and Rivers and Harbors Act permits based on authority in the Fish
and Wildlife Coordination Act and the Clean Water Act. The agency also administers the
National Wetlands Inventory.
D.

Natural Resources Conservation Service

The Natural Resources Conservation Service is an agency within the Department of
Agriculture (USDA). It is headed by a Chief, who reports to the Under Secretary for Natural
Resources and the Environment in USDA, and it is divided into 4 regions, which are
headed by Regional Conservationists. See U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural
40

Resources Conservation Service, National Headquarters Directory. The agency
administers the Swampbuster provisions of the Food Security Act and administers several
economic incentive programs for protection of wetlands on agricultural lands. See supra.
E.

U.S. Department of Justice, Environment and Natural Resources Division

While many disputes involving wetlands are resolved administratively, without going to
court, wetland litigation for the Corps, EPA and other federal agencies is handled by the
Environment and Natural Resources Division of the United States Department of Justice.
Within the Division, the Environmental Defense Section handles wetlands enforcement as
well as defense of most lawsuits against the Corps and EPA involving actions relating to
the Section 404 permitting program. For a history of the Division, see Richard J. Lazarus,
One Hundred Years of the Environment and Natural Resources Division, 41 ELR 10985
(Nov. 2011); U.S. Department of Justice, ENRD: Public Lands and National Treasures: The
First 100 Years of the Environment and Natural Resources Division (2009).

Research Problems
Agency Contacts: You represent a landowner in Charleston, South Carolina, who is interested in
obtaining a wetlands permit from the Corps. You understand that the Regulatory Section of the Corps
issues those permits at the District level. What telephone number would you call for more information about
the permitting process? If you ultimately needed to appeal a decision of the District Office, to what
Divisional Office would you appeal?
Assume that your client lives in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, instead of Charleston, and that your client is a
neighbor of a developer who is filling wetlands without a permit. Your client wants to speak to someone at
EPA about the violation in their office, rather than on the phone. Where is the closest Regional Office
located?

42

Hypothetical
Environmental law can be a complex area of practice. It often involves an intricate web of
federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies, and the disputes may focus on
complicated scientific principles. Consider that as you read the following dialogue between a
lawyer and a client regarding a wetlands matter. The lawyer has practiced family law for twentyfive years and specializes in divorce cases. The client has retained the lawyer to finalize the
terms of the client’s third divorce.

Scene: Lawyer’s office in Whitefish, Montana
Client: Well, three times was not the charm. I guess I keep you pretty busy, don’t I?
Lawyer: I’m sure that you’ll find true love one of these days. But until you do, I’m happy to help
you move on with your life.
Client: Thanks. You do a great job and I’m very happy with your work, but I would like it if I
didn’t need to keep seeing you like this every few years. While I’m here, though, I had a
question about a different issue. Do you do any environmental law?
Lawyer: If someone’s got an environmental law question, it usually has some science in it. I
usually try to stay as far away from those as I can.
Client: I don’t think this one is that tough. Here’s the thing. You know that my daughter just
graduated from college with an environmental science degree.
Lawyer: That’s great. Congratulations.
Client: Thanks. Well, she’s visiting a few weeks ago and she tells me that she thinks that this
little ditch in my backyard is a wetland. I told her that I was going to be filling it in to build a
garage back there and she told me that I might need to get a permit to do that. She said
something about a Clean Water Act. Does the city require permits for things like that? I know
that I had to get a permit from P&Z when I re-built my deck, but I didn’t know that they made
you get permits to fill ditches.
Lawyer: Like I said. I really have never handled any environmental cases, so I’m not sure about
whether the city or anyone else would require a permit for that. My sister is a lawyer, too, and
she deals with a lot of environmental matters in her real estate practice. I’d give her a call, but
we’re not really talking right now. I’ve got a friend in town who does hazardous waste law. He
might know something about wetlands and I could probably call him, but he’s on vacation until
next week.
Client: Next week would be o.k. I’m not planning to do anything about the garage for a while,
but I just wanted to know if I would need to get a permit before I did anything.

43

Lawyer: I’ll do a little research on it, then, and get back to you. But you know, I really don’t
feel right about charging you for that, since I don’t really do environmental law. This one will
be on the house.
Client: Well, that’s nice of you, but I really would feel better if I paid you for it.
Lawyer: I insist. No charge on this one. I’ll look into it and get back to you as soon as I can.
And I should have those papers for the divorce ready for you to sign tomorrow.
Client: Thanks. So I’ll stop back tomorrow, then.
(Client leaves)
Lawyer: Sam, could you call Paul’s office and see if he has some time to talk about a
wetlands issue?
Sam (Lawyer’s assistant): I would, but he’s on vacation for the next month.
Lawyer: A month? I thought that he was getting back next week.
Sam: No. It’s a month. He rented an RV and took the family to see all of the national parks in
California.
Lawyer: Oh, well. I guess he won’t be any help, then. Pat, I’ve got some research for you to
do.
Pat (Lawyer’s paralegal): O.K. What do you need?
Lawyer: I need you to find out whether someone needs to get a permit to fill a ditch to build
a garage. Our client says that his daughter thinks that the ditch is a wetland and that the
Clean Water Act might require him to get a permit to fill the ditch.
Pat: I’ll get right on it.
(Pat does some research and returns)
Pat: Good news. I searched through the whole Clean Water Act online and it only mentions
wetlands a few times, but doesn’t say anything about requiring a permit to fill wetlands. It
does have a few different permit programs, but they are only triggered if there is an addition
of a pollutant to a navigable water. You said that the client was asking about a ditch, right?

44

Lawyer: Yeah. The client said a ditch. The client’s daughter said a wetland. Neither of them
said anything about a navigable water. I would imagine that a navigable water is something
that you can navigate, right?
Pat: Well, I checked the regulations, and it’s actually a little broader than that. It turns out that
it’s the federal government - EPA and the Army - that administer the Clean Water Act. It’s not
a local government thing. They’ve adopted regulations to define navigable waters. I didn’t see
anything in the regulations about ditches, though, so I think that our client can go ahead and
fill the ditch without worrying about getting a permit.
Lawyer: That’s great. Thanks for finding that so quickly. I guess this environmental law isn’t
that tough, after all. I’m sure our client will be happy to hear that they can go ahead and fill the
ditch. I’ll call the client right now and fill them in on the good news.
Lawyer (on the phone): Jordan, good news. I did some research on your wetlands issue and
it looks like you won’t need a permit. You can go ahead and get started on your garage
whenever you like….
Question
Were you troubled, in any way, by the lawyer’s representation of the client on the wetlands
issue in the scenario above? Is it relevant that the lawyer was not paid for the advice? What
should the lawyer have done differently? See American Bar Association, Model Rule of
Professional Conduct 1.1 (and accompanying comments).

Administrative Law
The laws that protect wetlands in the United States are administered by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Army Corps of Engineers (the
Corps), and a variety of other federal, state and local agencies. It is important, therefore, to
understand the basic principles of administrative law in order to comprehend the nuances
of federal and state wetlands protection laws. This Chapter provides a general introduction
to administrative agencies and administrative law. Although the Chapter focuses primarily
on federal agencies, state and local agencies are often governed by state laws that closely
resemble the federal laws.

Administrative agencies are ubiquitous.
Think, for a moment, about your typical
day. Your alarm clock wakes you to the
sounds of your favorite radio station. That
station is licensed and regulated by the
Federal Communications Commission, a
federal administrative agency. As you
jump into the shower, the water may be delivered to your home by a municipal or regional
water authority, a public utility, which is usually regulated by a state utility commission. The
water quality is regulated by federal and state environmental or health agencies.

When you go to the kitchen for breakfast and pour yourself a bowl of cereal, you’ll notice
that the cereal package includes nutritional labels required by the Food and Drug
Administration. In addition, the production of the ingredients in the cereal, and in most of
the other foods that you put on your breakfast table, is likely regulated by federal, state and
maybe local agricultural and environmental agencies. Those products were produced by
businesses that were required to adhere to fair labor standards and workplace safety
standards set by federal and state labor departments. The electricity in your home is most
likely provided by a utility that is regulated by federal and state energy, environmental and
labor agencies, as well as state utility commissions.
If you drive to work, the car that you are driving was also likely produced in a factory that
was subject to fair labor and workplace safety standards. In addition, the car was built to
46

comply with safety and environmental standards set by federal and state transportation and
environmental agencies. Indeed, it is hard to identify events in your daily routine that are
not touched, in some way, by administrative agency regulation.
Administrative agencies exist at the federal, state and local levels and are often referred to
as the “fourth branch” of government. As is obvious from the discussion above, agencies
exert broad authorities over public and private activities. Moreover, agencies can take a
variety of types of actions. First, agencies often create standards, limits or other
requirements that apply to the communities that they regulate (rulemaking). For instance,
an environmental agency may set limits on the amount of lead that can be emitted into the
air by a factory or a car. As another example, in the context of wetlands regulation, the EPA
and Corps establish rules that outline the requirements for obtaining a permit to fill wetlands
under the Clean Water Act. See Chapter 6, infra.
In addition to setting standards and making rules, agencies apply the law and the rules that
they make to specific factual situations on a case-by-case basis (adjudication). In the
wetlands context, for instance, the Corps decides whether to issue or deny a wetlands
permit, and what conditions to include in the permit, by applying the Clean Water Act and
its regulations to the developer’s proposed activity. See Chapter 6, infra. Similarly, the
Corps or EPA can bring an administrative or judicial enforcement action against a person
when the agency determines that the person’s activities violate the Clean Water Act and/or
the agency’s regulations. See Chapter 10, infra.
In order to create rules and to make decisions on a case-by-case basis, agencies also
collect information from the regulated community and other sources. They maintain that
information, make much of it available to the public and often create reports based on the
information.
Consequently, administrative agencies engage in activities that can be characterized as
legislative (setting standards and establishing other rules), judicial (applying the law to
facts on a case-by-case basis) and executive (implementing and administering the law).
This combination of functions in federal administrative agencies creates some tensions,
because the United States Constitution exclusively assigns these functions to other
branches of government. Article I of the Constitution creates the Legislative Branch, and
provides that “[a]ll legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the
United States.” U.S. Const., Art. I. Similarly, Article III creates the Judicial Branch, and
provides that “[t]he judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme
Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and
establish.” U.S. Const., Art. III. Finally, Article II of the Constitution provides that “[t]he
executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.” U.S. Const., Art. II. In
contrast to those direct statements, there is no provision in the Constitution that explicitly
creates or authorizes the creation of administrative agencies or authorizes them to carry out
the powers delegated to the legislative, judicial or executive branches of government.
47

Similar separation-of-powers concerns can arise under state constitutions, which also do
not explicitly provide for state administrative agencies.
Nevertheless, agencies have flourished throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries
and courts have generally upheld most delegations of authority to agencies against
constitutional challenges, as discussed further below.
II.

Limits on Agency Authority

A.

Statutory Limits

Agencies are created by statutes. The composition of agencies, their authorities, and any
limits on their authorities are set forth in legislation. Congress or a state legislature often
initially creates an agency through an “organic statute,” but the legislature frequently
expands or limits the agency’s powers through other statutes that target the specific agency
or statutes that apply generically to a group of agencies or to all agencies. For example,
EPA was initially created by a Presidential Reorganization Plan that reassigned
responsibilities of other federal administrative agencies to EPA, see Office of the President,
Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 (July 9, 1970), but Congress subsequently passed
dozens of laws that expanded or limited EPA’s authority to regulate various activities. As
noted throughout this book, the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251, et seq., establishes
most of the authorities and limits on authority for wetlands regulation by EPA and the Army
Corps.
As noted above, Congress frequently authorizes, and sometimes requires, agencies to set
standards or to promulgate rules that apply generally to persons or entities regulated by the
statute. There are several reasons why Congress gives this power, which seems like lawmaking authority, to agencies. In some cases, the legislature simply does not have the time
to set standards at the level of detail that is necessary to implement the law. For instance,
the Clean Water Act imposes limits on hundreds of different types of industries regarding
the amount of potentially hundreds of different types of pollutants that they might discharge
based on technologies that those industries can use to reduce or eliminate those pollutants.
See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Water: Industry Effluent Guidelines. When
Congress created the program limiting those pollutants, it delegated to the EPA the
authority to establish specific numerical limits on the industries through a rulemaking
process, rather than trying to establish those thousands of numerical limits in the statute
itself. See 33 U.S.C. § 1311.
In addition to not having the time to enact detailed standards, Congress also may not have
the expertise to determine what specific numerical standards may be appropriate for
specific industries. Although the legislature will likely have some experts on staff, they will
not have the resources that are available to an administrative agency, which will also have
the experience of implementing the law on a day-to-day basis. Continuing with the Clean
48

Water Act example, because an agency may be better equipped to determine the specific
numerical pollutant limits, Congress will often give the agency general directions regarding
how to set those numerical limits but allow the agency to establish the limits through a
rulemaking process.
There are a few other reasons why Congress frequently delegates authority to agencies to
make rules. To the extent that regulatory restrictions in a law are based on specific
technological, economic, or other assumptions that are in existence at the time the
restrictions are put in place, those restrictions may no longer be appropriate when the
technological, economic or other circumstances change. If Congress were to have set the
regulatory restrictions by statute, Congress could only change the restrictions by enacting
another statute. When Congress delegates the authority to an agency to set the restrictions
through rulemaking, however, the agency can respond to changing circumstances by
changing the requirements through rulemaking, as opposed to waiting for legislative
consensus. In theory, the rulemaking process should be faster than the legislative process.
In practice, that is not always true.
A final reason why Congress may delegate authority to an agency to make rules, rather
than setting the standards directly through legislation, is that Congress may lack the
political will to set the standards itself. Delegating to an agency the authority to set
specific standards gives Congress political cover from difficult political issues in
implementation of the legislation.
B.
Constitutional Limits
While agencies are created by statute, Congress cannot
amend the Constitution simply by enacting a statute.
Consequently, at the dawn of the era of administrative law,
opponents of agency rulemaking frequently asserted that
the delegation of rulemaking authority to an agency
violated constitutional separation of powers principles,
on the basis that Article I vests legislative powers
exclusively in Congress. The United States Supreme Court
outlined the limits of Congress’ authority to delegate Photo 15 National Archives
rulemaking authority to agencies in J.W. Hampton, Jr. & http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/
Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928), when the File:Constitution_Pg1of4_AC_icon_
cut.png
Court held that Congress could constitutionally delegate
ratemaking authority as long as it set forth “by legislative act an intelligible principle to
which the person or body authorized to fix rates is directed to conform.” Thus, as long as
Congress provides a very general standard for the agency to use to set more specific
standards, courts will uphold the statutory delegation of rulemaking authority against a
Constitutional challenge. The Supreme Court has not struck down a federal statute on the
grounds that it constituted an excessive delegation of legislative authority since 1935, when
it invalidated codes of fair competition established under the National Industrial Recovery
49

Act in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). Since that
time, the Court has upheld broad delegations of authority, including the authority to set “just
and reasonable rates”, see FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591 (1944), to set
prices that are “fair and equitable”, see Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414 (1944), and to
regulate licensing “as public interest, convenience, or necessity require.” See National
Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190 (1943). In a more recent decision in the
environmental arena, the Supreme Court upheld the Clean Air Act delegation of authority to
EPA to set “ambient air quality standards the attainment and maintenance of which in the
judgment of the Administrator, based on such criteria and allowing an adequate margin of
safety, are requisite to protect the public health.” See Whitman v. American Trucking
Assns., Inc., 531 U.S. 457 (2001).
The delegation of adjudicative authority to agencies has also been challenged as a
violation of separation of powers principles. Because Article III vests all judicial power in
the Article III courts, critics have argued that the delegation of authority to agencies to apply
the law to facts on a case-by-case basis to issue or deny permits, to impose penalties, or to
take other adjudicative actions violates the Constitution. A discussion of the case law
interpreting the constitutional limits on the delegation of adjudicative authority to agencies is
beyond the scope of this book. In the wetlands context, however, most final administrative
adjudications can be challenged at some point in an Article III court, so the separation of
powers issue has not proven problematic in the context of federal wetland regulation.
C.

Limits Imposed by Other Branches

Although agencies are referred to as the “fourth branch” of government, the other branches
can influence agencies actions in a variety of ways. Because the source and limits of
agencies’ powers are set by statute, Congress can exert significant influence over
agencies by passing laws that reduce or eliminate agencies’ powers if Congress opposes
actions taken by agencies. Similarly, agencies rely on annual appropriations legislation
from Congress to fund their activities, so Congress can exert influence over agencies by
decreasing, or threatening to decrease, an agency’s budget. In the wetlands context,
Congress has frequently attached riders to appropriations legislation that limit the authority
of the Corps to implement policies with which Congress disagrees. See Chapter 4, infra. In
addition to those powers, the Senate has the power to approve the appointment of
“officers,” which can include high ranking agency officials. See U.S. Const., Art. II, § 2. The
Senate may block or delay appointments of those officials if the Senate opposes the
potential candidate or, sometimes, if the Senate opposes the policies that have been
adopted by the agency. Even when Congress does not actually exercise any of these
powers, it can exert control over agencies by threatening to exercise them. Congress
frequently holds oversight hearings, calling agency leaders to testify regarding actions
taken by the agency or to testify regarding proposed legislative changes.
The President also exerts control and influence over agencies, including the Corps and
50

EPA. The White House has ultimate control over the budget, legislative proposals, and
litigation positions taken by Executive Branch agencies. Although the agencies can develop
budget requests, the requests are coordinated through the White House Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) and the White House makes the ultimate decision
regarding the amount of funds to request for each agency. Similarly, agencies cannot work
with legislators independently to advance legislative proposals to expand their authorities or
eliminate responsibilities. Legislative proposals, like budget requests, must be coordinated
through the OMB. OMB also reviews major regulations developed by agencies, as well as
regulatory agendas and various guidance documents prepared by agencies. For litigation,
Executive Branch agencies are generally represented by the Department of Justice, so the
White House also can exert some control over the positions taken in litigation by agencies.
The President also has the power to appoint and remove officers of the United States,
which includes high ranking agency officials. See U.S. Const., Art. II, § 2.
One of the more formal ways that the President controls Executive Branch agencies is
through the issuance of Executive Orders. Executive Orders are not laws; instead, they
direct agencies, where agencies have discretion, to implement policies, take actions, or
follow procedures outlined in the order. Because an Executive Order is not a law, it cannot
change existing law, but it can influence the manner in which agencies exercise discretion
afforded to them under existing laws. Executive Orders cannot be challenged in court, but
some orders have been held to be enforceable in administrative proceedings. Over the
years, Presidents have issued several Executive Orders that apply to the development of
wetlands regulations and other regulations, including an Executive Order that requires
agencies to weigh the costs and benefits of major rules, see Executive Order 12866, 58
Fed. Reg. 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993), and an Executive Order that requires agencies to consider
whether their actions may unconstitutionally “take” property. See Executive Order 12630,
53 Fed. Reg. 8859 (Mar. 15, 1988).
The judicial branch also exerts control. Because the courts have
the ultimate authority to adjudicate disputes involving the Clean
Water Act and other wetlands protection laws, the judicial
branch can limit agencies by invalidating their actions if they
misinterpret the law, fail to follow procedures required by
statutes, regulations, or the Constitution, or make decisions that
are unreasonable. Those limits are explored more fully in the
judicial review section of this Chapter.

III.

Procedural Requirements for Agency Action

Although agencies engage in a variety of different activities, most agency actions can be
categorized as either rulemaking or adjudication. As noted above, adjudication involves
the application of law to a specific set of facts, while rulemaking involves establishing a
general standard or obligation that applies broadly and prospectively. The Administrative
Procedures Act (APA), the federal statute that establishes the procedures that all agencies
must follow and that outlines the manner in which agency actions can be challenged in
court, defines a “rule” as “the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or
particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or
policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency ...”
5 U.S.C. § 551(4). The Act defines “adjudication”, as “agency process for formulation of an
order”, 5 U.S.C. § 551(7), and defines “order” as “the whole or a part of a final disposition,
whether affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an agency in a matter
other than rule making but including licensing.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(6). Although rulemaking and
adjudication are distinct categories of agency actions, an agency can generally interpret
and clarify ambiguous provisions of a statute either through rulemaking or in an
adjudication, if Congress has given the agency both powers and has not required the
agency to use a specific procedure to interpret the statute. See Securities and Exchange
Commission v. Chenery, 332 U.S. 194 (1947).
Within the broad category of rulemaking, an agency’s rules can be divided into legislative
rules (sometimes called “substantive rules”) and non-legislative rules. When Congress,
in a statute, authorizes an agency to makes rules that have the force of law and the agency
adopts rules pursuant to that statutory authority, following the required administrative
procedures (generally known as “notice and comment” rulemaking), the rules are
legislative rules. For example, the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to issue any
regulations that are necessary to carry out the agency’s functions under the Act, see 33
U.S.C. § 1361(a), and authorizes the Corps to adopt regulations to implement the Section
404 permit program. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344. Thus, when EPA adopts rules to clarify the
meaning of the statutory term “waters of the United States,” which is not defined in the
Clean Water Act, EPA’s rules are legislative rules. Similarly, the Corps’ section 404
permitting regulations, the 404(b)(1) Guidelines adopted by EPA, with the Corps, and the
compensatory mitigation regulations adopted by EPA and the Corps are legislative rules.
While agencies with legislative rulemaking authority can adopt legislative rules, there are
times when an agency does not have legislative rulemaking authority or when an agency
has that authority but prefers not to exercise it. In those situations, agencies can still
interpret a statute through a non-legislative rule. Agencies may choose to interpret
statutes through non-legislative rules for a variety of reasons. First, as will be discussed
below, agencies must follow certain procedures when adopting legislative rules, but are
subject to very few procedural requirements when adopting non-legislative rules. Because
the legislative rulemaking procedures may be time consuming, an agency may decide to
52

issue a non-legislative rule in order to announce its interpretation of the law more quickly.
An agency might also decide to use a non-legislative rule because the agency is still
uncertain about its interpretation of the statute and would like to retain the flexibility to
change that interpretation without going through a legislative rulemaking process, which it
would be required to do if it wanted to change a legislative rule. In addition, because a nonlegislative rule is often not a “final agency action,” an agency can also generally avoid legal
challenges to the rule in court.
Non-legislative rules are issued in a variety of forms, including interpretative rules, policy
statements, guidance documents, and enforcement manuals, among others. In the
wetlands context, the Corps issues many legal and policy interpretations in the form of
Regulatory Guidance Letters. The delineation manual discussed in Chapter 1 is another
example of a non-legislative rule. In addition, important wetlands legal and policy directives
of EPA, the Corps, and other federal agencies are included in Memoranda of Agreement
and Memoranda of Understanding discussed throughout this book. Federal administrative
agencies, across the board, have increasingly interpreted statutes through guidance
documents and other non-legislative rules because of the advantages outlined above.
While an agency can save time, avoid litigation, and retain flexibility by interpreting a
statute through a non-legislative rule, legislative rules have two distinct advantages over
non-legislative rules. First, legislative rules have the force of law and agencies do not have
to independently justify the basis for the rule when applying it to a specific factual setting.
Non-legislative rules, on the other hand, are not binding on the agency or the regulated
community. An agency must justify the basis for the legal or policy interpretation adopted in
the non-legislative rule when applying it to a specific factual setting. The second important
advantage that legislative rules have is that courts will accord an agency more deference
when reviewing the statutory interpretation adopted by the agency in a legislative rule than
in a non-legislative rule. The different standards of judicial review that apply to legislative
and non-legislative rules are discussed in the judicial review section of this Chapter.

rules issued by agencies (2013)

The procedures that agencies must
follow when adopting rules or making
decisions through adjudication are set
by the APA, which applies to all federal
agencies, but can be modified by
specific statutes, such as the Clean
Water Act. The APA requires agencies
to follow either formal rulemaking
procedures or informal (“notice and comment”) rulemaking procedures when adopting
legislative rules, see 5 U.S.C. § 553, but it exempts non-legislative rules from those
procedural requirements. Id. § 553(b)(3)(A). Formal rulemaking involves a trial-type
hearing before an administrative law judge, who makes a decision based on a record
presented at the hearing. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 556 - 557. An agency must adopt rules through
formal rulemaking only when the statute that authorizes the agency to make rules requires
the agency to make the rules “on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.” See 5
U.S.C. § 553(c). Courts rarely interpret statutes to require formal rulemaking and have not
interpreted the Clean Water Act to require formal rulemaking for the regulations adopted by
the Corps or EPA.
If an agency is not required to follow formal rulemaking procedures when adopting
legislative rules, the agency must follow the APA’s informal rulemaking procedures. For
informal rulemaking, the APA requires agencies to begin the process by publishing a
notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register, including the terms or substance
of the proposed rule, a reference to the legal authority for the rule, and a statement of the
time, place and nature of public rulemaking proceedings. See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b). The
54

agency is not required to hold public hearings, although it can, but the agency is required to
provide interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. Id. § 553(c).
Unlike formal rulemaking, therefore, there is no formal record for the agency’s decision and
the agency can rely solely on written submissions in formulating its rule. At the end of the
comment period, the agency reviews the public input and decides whether to make any
changes to the proposed rule based on the comments that the agency received. When the
agency has finalized the rule in light of the public input, the APA requires the agency to
provide a “concise general statement of [the] .. basis and purpose” of the rules, which
the agency publishes with the final rule in the Federal Register. Id. Agencies do not have to
change rules based on the public input, but they must consider the comments, respond to
the major comments and identify the “major issues of policy” that they considered in
formulating the rule. See United States of America v. Nova Scotia Food Products Corp.,
568 F.2d 240 (2d Cir. 1977).
Today, significant portions of the notice-and-comment process take place online, and
interested persons are able to view comments submitted by other persons during the
comment period, as well as significant amounts of information that the agency relied on in
preparing a proposed rule that would not have been as readily accessible before agencies
began to carry out the notice and comment process online. See Regulations.gov.
While the APA establishes procedures for legislative (or substantive) rules, it does not
require agencies to follow any specific procedures when adopting non-legislative rules.
Agencies generally develop such guidance with very little input from the public or notice to
the public. Although the APA does not require agencies to follow procedures in developing
non-legislative rules, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires federal agencies to
publish, in the Federal Register, “statements of general policy or interpretations of general
applicability formulated and adopted by the agency.” See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1)(D). In
addition, FOIA requires agencies to make available to the public other statements of
policy or interpretations that haven’t been published in the Federal Register, as well as
“administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.” Id.
§ 552(a)(2).
Congress can impose additional procedural requirements on the development of legislative
or non-legislative rules by agencies and, when it does, the rulemaking process is referred
to as hybrid rulemaking. However, the Clean Water Act does not require EPA or the
Corps to follow additional procedures beyond the APA’s when adopting regulations and
guidance under the statute.

Research and Drafting Exercise
Most federal agencies post proposed and final rules, as well as guidance documents and other
important public information on their websites. In addition, many federal agencies post proposed
rulemakings and documents that support the proposed rulemakings online and allow interested
persons to comment online through Regulations.gov Those agencies also make the final rules,
supporting documents and comments available on Regulations.gov Guidance documents and other
agency materials are also posted on Regulations.gov
1. In 2014, EPA and the Corps of Engineers issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to re-define
“waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act. The proposal was posted on
Regulations.gov on April 21, 2014. Search Regulations.gov to find the EPA docket for the proposed
rule. When you find it, click on the “Open Docket Folder” link. This lists all of the documents that were
posted that are associated with the rulemaking. Who were the agency contacts for the rule?
2. Review the proposed rule and identify: (a) the legal authority for the rule adopted by EPA and the
Corps; (b) the length of the comment period; (c) the proposed definition of “waters of the United
States” that would be included in 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(a); (d) whether EPA or the Corps prepared an
environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment for the proposed rulemaking.
3. In the supporting documents for the proposed rule, review the economic analysis prepared for the
rule and identify the total low and high estimated incremental annual indirect costs and benefits of the
proposed rule (per Exhibit 16). Does EPA estimate that benefits of the rule will be greater than the
costs?
4. To get a flavor for the nature of public comments submitted in notice and comment rulemaking,
search for the docket for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s (FMCSA) rule restricting
the use of cellular phones by drivers of commercial vehicles. (FMCSA-2010-0096). When you find
that docket, click on the “Open Docket Folder” link and browse through some of the comments
submitted to FMCSA for the rule. Compare, for instance, the comments submitted by Robert Paul
Smith or Wildon Clyde Renn III, and those submitted by Edison Electric Institute or the Alliance of
Automobile Manufacturers. Review the “Tips for Submitting Effective Comments” on the
Regulations.gov page. After reviewing those tips, do you think that the comments of Mr. Smith or the
Edison Electric Institute are likely to be more effective?

Adjudication Procedures

Just as the APA establishes minimum procedural requirements for federal agency
rulemaking, it also establishes minimum procedural requirements for adjudication. As with
rulemaking, the APA creates distinct procedural requirements for formal adjudication and
for informal adjudication. See 5 U.S.C. § 554. The APA requirements for formal
adjudication are similar to the requirements for formal rulemaking and include a trial-type
hearing before an administrative law judge, who makes a decision based on a record
presented at the hearing. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 554, 556 - 557.
In contrast to the requirements for formal adjudication, the APA includes minimal
requirements for informal adjudication. If an agency is denying a written application,
petition or request of a person, the statute requires the agency to give the person “prompt
notice” and “a brief statement of the grounds for denial.” 5 U.S.C. § 555(e). The APA does
not include any other procedural requirements for informal adjudication, but FOIA requires
agencies to “make available for public inspection and copying” any “final opinions ... as well
as orders, made in the adjudication of cases.” Id. § 552(a)(2)(A).
Agencies must follow the APA’s formal adjudication procedures whenever a statute
requires the agency to make a decision in adjudication “on the record after opportunity for
an agency hearing.” See 5 U.S.C. § 554(a). Although formal adjudication is much more
common than formal rulemaking, courts have not interpreted the Clean Water Act to require
the Corps or EPA to use formal adjudication procedures when taking most actions involving
wetland regulation under the Clean Water Act, including issuing or denying permits, vetoing
permits, or approving or denying a state’s request to assume federal permitting authority.
However, the agencies must use formal adjudication procedures when they are imposing
Class II penalties, the most severe form of administrative penalties that the Clean Water
Act authorizes. See 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(2)(B).

Hypotheticals
1. 33 U.S.C. § 1361 provides that "[t]he [EPA] Administrator is authorized to prescribe
such regulations as are necessary to carry out his functions under [the Clean Water
Act.]" If EPA planned to issue rules under the Clean Water Act to define the undefined
statutory term "waters of the United States", would the agency be required to follow the
trial-type procedures in 5 U.S.C. §§ 556 and 557 when issuing those rules?
2. 33 U.S.C. § 1317(b)(1) provides that "[t]he [EPA] Administrator shall, within one
hundred and eighty days after October 18, 1972, and from time to time thereafter,
publish proposed regulations establishing pretreatment standards for ... [sewage
treatment plants]. Not later than ninety days after such publication, and after
opportunity for public hearing, the Administrator shall promulgate such pretreatment
standards. ..." Does the statute require EPA to use formal rulemaking procedures or
notice and comment rulemaking when promulgating pretreatment standards?
3. 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a) provides that "[t]he Secretary [of the Army] may issue permits,
after notice and opportunity for public hearings for the discharge of dredged or fill
material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites." Does the statute require
the Secretary to follow the trial-type procedures in 5 U.S.C. §§ 556 and 557 when
issuing permits?
4. 33 U.S.C. 1344(i), which focuses on federal oversight of states that have taken over
administration of the Clean Water Act Section 404 permitting program, provides that
"Whenever the Administrator determines after public hearing that a State is not
administering a program approved under ... this section, in accordance with this
section, the Administrator shall so notify the State, and if appropriate corrective action
is not taken within a reasonable time, ... the Administrator shall ... withdraw approval of
such program until the Administrator determines such corrective action has been
taken..." Does the statute require EPA to use formal adjudication procedures when
determining that a State is not administering a permitting program in accordance with
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act? Does the statute require EPA to use formal
adjudication procedures when determining that the State has taken corrective action
and may take over administration of the permitting program again?

IV.

Judicial Review of Agency Action

A.

Prerequisites for a judicial challenge

In order to challenge an agency action in court, a litigant must generally demonstrate, at a
minimum, that: (1) the action is reviewable; (2) the court has jurisdiction to hear the
litigant’s challenge and grant the requested relief; (3) the government has waived
sovereign immunity and authorized the suit; and (4) the litigant has standing to sue.
59

In addition to establishing minimum procedural requirements for federal agencies, the APA
creates the general framework for judicial review of federal agency actions. It provides that
a “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court ..[is] subject to
judicial review,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, and “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency
action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a
relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. As a result, “final
agency actions” are presumptively reviewable in court. Chapter 10 of this book outlines
the actions of the Corps and EPA that are “final agency actions” that are reviewable under
the APA. The APA’s judicial review provisions, including the presumption of reviewability,
do not apply when a statute precludes judicial review or when an agency action is
committed to agency discretion by law, see 5 U.S.C. § 701(a), but neither of those
exceptions have significantly limited judicial review of the EPA’s or the Corps’ actions in
implementing the federal wetlands protection program. Those exceptions are examined in
more detail in Chapter 10 of this book.
The APA does not grant subject matter jurisdiction to any court to hear the challenges
that it makes reviewable, so litigants must rely on another statute to demonstrate
jurisdiction. If the statute that authorizes the agency to take the action that a litigant wants
to challenge does not include a provision that grants jurisdiction to a court to hear
challenges to that action, litigants can frequently rely on 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (the general
federal question jurisdiction statute) or other general jurisdictional statutes to establish
jurisdiction for their lawsuit. The general federal question jurisdiction statute provides “[t]he
district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution,
laws, or treaties of the United States.” Id. Although the Clean Water Act includes a judicial
review provision that explicitly authorizes courts to review EPA actions outside of the
wetlands context, litigants must generally rely on 28 U.S.C. § 1331 to establish jurisdiction
to challenge actions of EPA and the Corps in administering the federal wetlands protection
program. However, if a litigant is challenging the government’s action as an unconstitutional
“taking” of property, federal statutes grant jurisdiction to the Court of Federal Claims or
federal district courts (depending on the amount in controversy) to hear those challenges.
See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346, 1491. Takings claims are discussed at length in Chapter 11 of this
book.
The general federal question jurisdiction statute does not waive the government’s
sovereign immunity, but the APA waives sovereign immunity to the extent that a litigant is
seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as opposed to money damages. See 5 U.S.C. §
702. In the wetlands context, litigants that are challenging actions of the Corps or EPA are
generally seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, rather than money damages, so the APA
waiver of sovereign immunity is sufficient for their challenges. When litigants are
challenging federal agency actions as a “taking” of their property, the statutes that grant the
court jurisdiction to hear those claims waive sovereign immunity of the government for the
money damages authorized by those statutes.
60

As noted above, in addition to demonstrating reviewability, jurisdiction, and a waiver of
sovereign immunity, litigants must demonstrate that they have standing to sue. Chapter 10
of this book discusses the standing requirement, as well as other limits on judicial review,
including mootness, ripeness, and statutes of limitation.
B.

Standards for judicial review

Although Congress can vary the standards for review of agency actions, the APA
establishes standards that generally apply to judicial review of agency actions under that
statute. Specifically, the APA provides that a reviewing court shall:
(2)

hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions
found to be
(A)
arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not
in accordance with law;
(B)
contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;
(C)
in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or
short of statutory right;
(D)
without observance of procedure required by law;
(E)
unsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to
sections 556 and 557 of this title or otherwise reviewed on the
record of an agency hearing provided by statute; or
(F)
unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are
subject to trial de novo by the reviewing court.”

5 U.S.C. § 706.
The standard that applies most frequently on judicial review of an agency’s action is the
arbitrary and capricious standard. The standard applies to all factual determinations
made by agencies outside of formal hearing procedures, as well as policy determinations
made by agencies. It is a narrow standard of review, which focuses on whether the agency
decision “was based on a consideration of relevant factors and whether there has been a
clear error of judgment...” See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S.
402, 416 (1971). As a result, if an agency does not explain its decision, ignores relevant
factors in reaching its decision, or makes a decision that seems clearly unreasonable in
light of the information considered by the agency, a court will find that the agency’s action is
arbitrary and capricious. When an agency is making determinations “within its special
expertise, at the frontiers of science,” the Supreme Court has counseled that a reviewing
court “must generally be at its most deferential.” See Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, 462 U.S. 87, 103 (1983).

61

Although the standard is quite deferential, courts reviewing an agency’s policy
determinations occasionally apply a more rigorous, less deferential version of the standard,
referred to as “hard look” arbitrary and capricious review. For instance, in Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Assoc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983),
the Supreme Court held that an agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if “the agency
has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to
consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that
runs counter to the evidence, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a
difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”
Regardless of whether a reviewing court is applying a “hard look” standard or the traditional
arbitrary and capricious standard, the court will not substitute its judgment for the agency
and will normally not make a decision in place of the agency when the court determines
that the agency’s decision is arbitrary and capricious. See Securities and Exchange
Commission v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80 (1943). Instead, in those cases, the reviewing
court will routinely remand the dispute back to the agency to resolve. Id.
While the arbitrary and capricious standard is ubiquitous in judicial review of agency action,
it does not generally apply to review of an agency’s legal interpretation of a statute. The
following landmark administrative law decision addresses that issue.

Council

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of
the Court.

In the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, * * *
Congress enacted certain requirements applicable
to States that had not achieved the national air
quality standards established by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to earlier
legislation. The amended Clean Air Act required
these "nonattainment" States to establish a permit
program regulating "new or modified major
stationary sources" of air pollution. Generally, a
permit may not be issued for a new or modified
major stationary source unless several stringent
conditions are met. * * * The EPA regulation
promulgated to implement this permit requirement

allows a State to adopt a plantwide definition of the term "stationary source." 1 Under this
definition, an existing plant that contains several pollution-emitting devices may install or
modify one piece of equipment without meeting the permit conditions if the alteration will
not increase the total emissions from the plant. The question presented by these cases is
whether EPA's decision to allow States to treat all of the pollution-emitting devices within
the same industrial grouping as though they were encased within a single "bubble" is based
on a reasonable construction of the statutory term "stationary source."
The EPA regulations containing the plantwide definition of the term stationary source were
promulgated on October 14, 1981. * * * Respondents3 filed a timely petition for review in
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C.
§ 7607(b)(1).4 The Court of Appeals set aside the regulations. * * * The court observed
that the relevant part of the amended Clean Air Act "does not explicitly define what
Congress envisioned as a stationary source, to which the permit program . . . should
apply," and further stated that the precise issue was not "squarely addressed in the
legislative history." * * * In light of its conclusion that the legislative history bearing on the
question was "at best contradictory," it reasoned that "the purposes of the nonattainment
program should guide our decision here." * * * Based on two of its precedents concerning
the applicability of the bubble concept to certain Clean Air Act programs, * * * the court
stated that the bubble concept was "mandatory" in programs designed merely to maintain
existing air quality, but held that it was "inappropriate" in programs enacted to improve air
quality. * * * Since the purpose of the permit program its "raison d'etre," in the court's view - was to improve air quality, the court held that the bubble concept was inapplicable in
these cases under its prior precedents. * * * It therefore set aside the regulations
2

"(i) 'Stationary source' means any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or
may emit any air pollutant subject to regulation under the Act."
"(ii) 'Building, structure, facility, or installation' means all of the pollutant-emitting activities
which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or
adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under
common control) except the activities of any vessel."

embodying the bubble concept as contrary to law. We granted certiorari to review that
judgment, * * * and we now reverse.
The basic legal error of the Court of Appeals was to adopt a static judicial definition of the
term "stationary source" when it had decided that Congress itself had not commanded that
definition. Respondents do not defend the legal reasoning of the Court of Appeals. 7
Nevertheless, since this Court reviews judgments, not opinions, * * * we must determine
whether the Court of Appeals' legal error resulted in an erroneous judgment on the validity
of the regulations.
II
When a court reviews an agency's construction of the statute which it administers, it is
confronted with two questions. First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly
spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of
the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously
expressed intent of Congress.9 If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly
addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own
construction on the statute, * * * as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative
interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,
the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible
construction of the statute.11
"The power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created . . .

Respondents argued below that EPA's plantwide definition of "stationary source" is
contrary to the terms, legislative history, and purposes of the amended Clear Air Act. The
court below rejected respondents' arguments based on the language and legislative history
of the Act. It did agree with respondents contention that the regulations were inconsistent
with the purposes of the Act, but did not adopt the construction of the statute advanced by
respondents here. Respondents rely on the arguments rejected by the Court of Appeals in
support of the judgment, and may rely on any ground that finds support in the record. * * *
9

The judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction, and must reject
administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent. * * * If a
court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an
intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law, and must be given
effect.
11

The court need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly
could have adopted to uphold the construction, or even the reading the court would have
reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding. * * *

program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill
any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress."
Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 231 (1974). If Congress has explicitly left a gap for the
agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a
specific provision of the statute by regulation. Such legislative regulations are given
controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.
* * * Sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit,
rather than explicit. In such a case, a court may not substitute its own construction of a
statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.
***
We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive
department's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer, * * * and the
principle of deference to administrative interpretations
"has been consistently followed by this Court whenever decision as to the meaning
or reach of a statute has involved reconciling conflicting policies, and a full
understanding of the force of the statutory policy in the given situation has depended
upon more than ordinary knowledge respecting the matters subjected to agency
regulations. See, e.g., National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190;
Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U.S. 111; Republic Aviation Corp. v.
Labor Board, 324 U.S. 793; Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., 332
U.S. 194; Labor Board v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U.S. 344. . . . If this choice
represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed
to the agency's care by the statute, we should not disturb it unless it appears from
the statute or its legislative history that the accommodation is not one that Congress
would have sanctioned."
United States v. Shimer, 367 U.S.374, 367 U.S. 382, 383 (1961). * * *
In light of these well-settled principles, it is clear that the Court of Appeals misconceived the
nature of its role in reviewing the regulations at issue. Once it determined, after its own
examination of the legislation, that Congress did not actually have an intent regarding the
applicability of the bubble concept to the permit program, the question before it was not
whether, in its view, the concept is "inappropriate" in the general context of a program
designed to improve air quality, but whether the Administrator's view that it is appropriate in
the context of this particular program is a reasonable one. Based on the examination of the
legislation and its history which follows, we agree with the Court of Appeals that Congress
did not have a specific intention on the applicability of the bubble concept in these cases,
and conclude that the EPA's use of that concept here is a reasonable policy choice for the
agency to make. * * *

65

VII
* * * We are not persuaded that parsing of general terms in the text of the statute will
reveal an actual intent of Congress. * * *
Legislative History
In addition, respondents argue that the legislative history and policies of the Act foreclose
the plantwide definition, and that the EPA's interpretation is not entitled to deference,
because it represents a sharp break with prior interpretations of the Act.
Based on our examination of the legislative history, we agree with the Court of Appeals that
it is unilluminating. * * * We find that the legislative history as a whole is silent on the
precise issue before us. It is, however, consistent with the view that the EPA should have
broad discretion in implementing the policies of the 1977 Amendments.
More importantly, that history plainly identifies the policy concerns that motivated the
enactment; the plantwide definition is fully consistent with one of those concerns -- the
allowance of reasonable economic growth -- and, whether or not we believe it most
effectively implements the other, we must recognize that the EPA has advanced a
reasonable explanation for its conclusion that the regulations serve the environmental
objectives as well. * * * Indeed, its reasoning is supported by the public record developed
in the rulemaking process, * * * as well as by certain private studies. * * *
Our review of the EPA's varying interpretations of the word "source" -- both before and after
the 1977 Amendments -- convinces us that the agency primarily responsible for
administering this important legislation has consistently interpreted it flexibly -- not in a
sterile textual vacuum, but in the context of implementing policy decisions in a technical
and complex arena. The fact that the agency has from time to time changed its
interpretation of the term "source" does not, as respondents argue, lead us to conclude that
no deference should be accorded the agency's interpretation of the statute. An initial
agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone. On the contrary, the agency, to
engage in informed rulemaking, must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its
policy on a continuing basis. Moreover, the fact that the agency has adopted different
definitions in different contexts adds force to the argument that the definition itself is
flexible, particularly since Congress has never indicated any disapproval of a flexible
reading of the statute. * * *
Policy
The arguments over policy that are advanced in the parties' briefs create the impression
that respondents are now waging in a judicial forum a specific policy battle which they
ultimately lost in the agency and in the 32 jurisdictions opting for the "bubble concept," but
66

one which was never waged in the Congress. Such policy arguments are more properly
addressed to legislators or administrators, not to judges.38
In these cases, the Administrator's interpretation represents a reasonable accommodation
of manifestly competing interests, and is entitled to deference: the regulatory scheme is
technical and complex, * * * the agency considered the matter in a detailed and reasoned
fashion, * * * and the decision involves reconciling conflicting policies. * * * Congress
intended to accommodate both interests, but did not do so itself on the level of specificity
presented by these cases. Perhaps that body consciously desired the Administrator to
strike the balance at this level, thinking that those with great expertise and charged with
responsibility for administering the provision would be in a better position to do so; perhaps
it simply did not consider the question at this level; and perhaps Congress was unable to
forge a coalition on either side of the question, and those on each side decided to take their
chances with the scheme devised by the agency. For judicial purposes, it matters not
which of these things occurred.
Judges are not experts in the field, and are not part of either political branch of the
Government. Courts must, in some cases, reconcile competing political interests, but not on
the basis of the judges' personal policy preferences. In contrast, an agency to which
Congress has delegated policymaking responsibilities may, within the limits of that
delegation, properly rely upon the incumbent administration's views of wise policy to inform
its judgments. While agencies are not directly accountable to the people, the Chief
Executive is, and it is entirely appropriate for this political branch of the Government to
make such policy choices -- resolving the competing interests which Congress itself either
inadvertently did not resolve, or intentionally left to be resolved by the agency charged with
the administration of the statute in light of everyday realities.
When a challenge to an agency construction of a statutory provision, fairly conceptualized,
really centers on the wisdom of the agency's policy, rather than whether it is a reasonable
choice within a gap left open by Congress, the challenge must fail. In such a case, federal
judges -- who have no constituency -- have a duty to respect legitimate policy choices
made by those who do. The responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such policy
choices and resolving the struggle between competing views of the public interest are not
38

Respondents point out if a brand new factory that will emit over 100 tons of pollutants is
constructed in a nonattainment area, that plant must obtain a permit pursuant to §
172(b)(6), and, in order to do so, it must satisfy the § 173 conditions, including the LAER
requirement. Respondents argue if an old plant containing several large emitting units is to
be modernized by the replacement of one or more units emitting over 100 tons of pollutant
with a new unit emitting less -- but still more than 100 tons -- the result should be no
different simply because "it happens to be built not at a new site, but within a preexisting
plant." * * *

Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 195 (1978).

statute which seeks to accommodate progress in reducing air pollution with economic
growth.

Questions and Comments
1.

The Bubble: Under the Clean Air Act, at the time of the decision, construction of a
new major “stationary source” or “modification” of a major “stationary source” in an
area of a state that was not meeting air quality standards (“nonattainment”) required
a permit and compliance with stringent technology-based air pollution limits. Not
every change in a stationary source, however, constituted a “modification.” A
change only constituted a “modification” if it resulted in the emission of a new
pollutant or an increase in emissions of existing pollutants. Therefore, as noted in
footnote 38 above, therefore, by defining “stationary source” to include an entire
plant, an industrial facility could avoid the permitting and new technology
requirements of the statute by replacing existing parts of a factory that are emitting
pollution with new parts, as long as the new parts emitted the same or less pollution
as the existing parts, since the facility would not be “modifying” a source. If,
however, each part of the facility that emitted pollution were defined as a separate
“source,” the construction of a new part would be construction of a “stationary
source” which could (if it were a major stationary source) trigger the permitting and
new technology requirements, regardless of whether any other portions of the facility
were being retired. Why do you think that NRDC opposed the bubble concept, and
why did Chevron favor it?

2.

The Two Step: The Court created a two-step test that is frequently used to review
agencies’ legal interpretations of statutory terms. At step one, Justice Stevens
suggests that courts must ask “whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise
question at issue.” Is the Court applying a clear statement test at step one? If so, is
the Court’s review limited to the language of the statute, or can it consider the
legislative history or purpose of the statute as well?
68

3.

Step Two: If a court determines, at step one, that the statute is silent or ambiguous,
then Chevron directs the court to defer to the agency’s interpretation as long as it is
“based on a permissible construction of the statute.” Subsequent cases routinely
rephrase step two to provide that courts should defer to the agency’s interpretation
as long as it is reasonable. In practice, courts almost always uphold agency
interpretations at step two. Consequently, most of the battles in Chevron cases are
fought based on statutory construction principles at step one.

4.

Agency Change in Position: The Court noted that EPA did not always interpret the
term “stationary source” to encompass the “bubble concept” and that the agency
had previously interpreted the term to apply to separate units within a plant. Does
the agency’s change in position make its decision unreasonable at step two? Would
the result have been the same if the agency had changed its interpretation several
times prior to adopting the regulations that were challenged in this case? Would the
result have been the same if the agency did not explain why it had changed its
interpretation of the term “stationary source”?

5.

Reason for Deference: In crafting a decision for a unanimous Court, Justice
Stevens identified several different reasons why deference to an agency’s
interpretation is warranted, including: (a) Congress intended that the agency should
resolve the issue; (b) agencies have specialized expertise to resolve the issue; and
(c) agencies are politically accountable through the democratic process. In
determining how far Chevron applies outside of the context in which the case arose,
courts have struggled to determine whether one rationale carries more weight than
others.

6.

Reach of Chevron: Chevron involved the review of an agency’s interpretation of a
statutory term when the agency had interpreted the term as a legislative rule through
notice-and-comment rulemaking. Sixteen years later, in Christensen v. Harris
County, 529 U.S. 576 (2000), the Supreme Court held that courts should generally
not apply Chevron when reviewing an agency’s interpretation of a statute through a
non-legislative rule, such as a guidance document, policy statement, or
interpretative rule. The following year, in United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218
(2001), the Court held that Chevron did not apply to review of a letter ruling issued
by the U.S. Customs Service. The Court provided some general guidance regarding
when Chevron should apply. Specifically, the Court indicated that Chevron applies
“when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make
rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming
deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.” Id. at 226-227
(emphasis added). The Court suggested that an agency could show the necessary
delegation of authority “in a variety of ways, as by an agency’s power to engage in
adjudication or notice and comment rulemaking, or by some other indication of a

comparable congressional intent.” Id. at 227. A year later, in Barnhart v. Walton, 535
U.S. 212, 222 (2002), the Court confused the analysis more, suggesting that in
determining whether Chevron applies, courts should also consider “the interstitial
nature of the legal question, the related expertise of the Agency, the importance of
the question to administration of the statute, the complexity of that administration,
and the careful consideration the agency has given the question over a long period
of time.” Although the Court’s Chevron jurisprudence is very complex, it is probably
safe to assume that when a court is reviewing a legislative rule adopted by an
agency through formal or informal rulemaking, or is reviewing a decision that an
agency has made through formal adjudication, the court will apply Chevron. It is also
probably safe to assume that in most cases, when a court is reviewing an agency’s
non-legislative rule, the court will not apply Chevron (although the Court has left the
door open to the possibility that Chevron might apply in a specific case). It is hard to
reach a similar broad conclusion regarding whether a court will apply Chevron to a
decision made by an agency in the context of informal adjudication. The answer will
lie in the ultimate clarification of the Court’s decisions in Mead and Barnhart.
7.

Skidmore: If a court reviewing an agency’s legal interpretation does not use the
Chevron analysis, that does not mean that the court will review the statutory
interpretation question de novo. Agencies are still accorded deference under an
earlier Supreme Court decision, although the deference is weaker than Chevron
deference. In Skidmore v. Swift, the Supreme Court, reviewing a decision of the
Administrator of the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division, held that:
the rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator under this Act,
while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do
constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and
litigants may properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment in a
particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its
consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and
later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade,
if lacking power to control.
323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944).

8.

Agency interpretations of agency regulations: Chevron involved judicial review of
an agency’s interpretation of a statute. However, agencies occasionally adopt
regulations that are ambiguous and need to be interpreted further. When a court
reviews an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations, rather than the
interpretation of a statute, courts accord the agency an even greater level of
deference than Chevron deference. In Auer v. Robins, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997),
the Supreme Court held that courts should uphold an agency’s interpretation of its
regulations unless it is “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.”

Hypotheticals
1. Focusing on the same statutory language that was interpreted in Chevron, assume, for
purposes of this hypothetical, that EPA did not promulgate a regulation that allowed states to
adopt a plant-wide definition of "stationary source." Instead of adopting a regulation, EPA adopted
a "policy statement" that indicated that states could adopt a plant-wide definition of "stationary
source". The agency adopted the policy statement because it was not fully committed to that
interpretation of the statute and wanted to consider the matter further before issuing a regulation
to define the term. Nevertheless, EPA published the policy statement in the Federal Register and
posted it on its website. If NRDC were able to challenge EPA's policy statement, should a court
review the agency's interpretation of the statute under the Chevron analysis or some other
analysis?
2. Focusing on the same statutory language that was interpreted in Chevron, assume that EPA
did not promulgate a regulation that allowed states to adopt a plant-wide definition of "stationary
source" and assume that they did not adopt a policy statement to that effect either. Assume that
they did not provide any direction to states or regulated industries regarding the definition of
"stationary source." Instead, assume that EPA began an administrative penalty proceeding (an
informal process) against Chevron alleging that Chevron was violating the Clean Air Act because
it had not sought a permit for modifications to its refinery. In the context of that informal
administrative proceeding, EPA announced that it was interpreting the term "stationary source" to
mean each smokestack in a plant. If Chevron appealed EPA's decision to court, would the
reviewing court apply the Chevron analysis to EPA's interpretation of "stationary source" or would
the court apply some other analysis?
3. Focusing on the same statutory language that was interpreted in Chevron, assume that EPA
adopted the regulations that it adopted in Chevron, allowing States to adopt a plant-wide definition
of "stationary source." Assume, however, that the regulations were ambiguous regarding whether
a "plant-wide" definition could incorporate smokestacks that were located a mile away from the
plant (but were related to the process at the plant), and that EPA began an administrative penalty
proceeding against Chevron when Chevron made changes to the off-site processes that
increased pollution from an off-site smokestack without obtaining a permit, because the agency
determined that the term "stationary source" should not include off-site stacks. If Chevron
appealed EPA's decision to court, would the reviewing court apply the Chevron analysis to EPA's
interpretation of "stationary source" or would the court apply some other analysis?

Chapter 4
Regulation of Wetlands and Waters of
the United States
I.

Activities Regulated Under the Clean Water Act

A. The Rivers and Harbors Act
Clean Water Act, federal regulation of wetlands
was generally limited to regulation under the Rivers
and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C.
§ 401, et. seq. Section 10 of the Act prohibits
obstruction of navigable waters except in
accordance with a permit issued by the Corps of
Engineers, see 33 U.S.C. § 403, and Section 13 of
the Act prohibits the deposit of refuse into the
navigable waters. See 33 U.S.C. § 407. As
explored further later in this chapter, though, the
main focus of the statute was, and remains,
protection of navigability of the nation’s waters.
The statutory definition of “navigable waters” is Photo 18 Corps of Engineers photo driven by that focus, ands limited to waters that are http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Two
“subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and/or are _Harbors_Minnesota_aerial_view.jpg
presently used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible for use to transport
interstate or foreign commerce.” 33 C.F.R. § 329.4. As a result, very few wetlands were or
are regulated as “navigable waters” under the Rivers and Harbors Act.
B.

The Clean Water Act

When Congress adopted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972,
though, it greatly expanded federal regulation over a broad range of activities in wetlands
and other waters, with a focus on protecting water quality rather than protecting navigation.
See 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a) (providing that the objectives of the Act are to “restore and
maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters”). Indeed, in
the Act, Congress established, as a national goal, “that the discharge of pollutants into the
navigable waters be eliminated by 1985.” Id. § 1251(a)(1).
Section 301: Perhaps the most important provision of the statute, for purposes of federal
72

regulation of wetlands and other waters, is Section 301, which prohibits “the discharge of
any pollutant by any person” except in compliance with Section 301 and with several other
sections of the statute, including the sections that create the federal permitting programs for
point source discharges and discharges into wetlands. 33 U.S.C. § 1311(a). The statute
further defines “the discharge of a pollutant” to mean the “addition of any pollutant to
navigable waters from any point source”. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(12).
As a result, Section 301 requires permits and compliance with the other requirements of
Section 301 for an activity if all of the following requirements are met:





there is an addition

by a person

402 and 404 Permit Programs: The Clean Water Act creates two separate permit
programs to regulate discharges of pollutants into navigable waters. While the Section 402
permit program, administered by EPA and the states, is the primary permitting program for
point source discharges of pollution into the navigable waters, see 33 U.S.C. § 1342, most
activities involving wetlands are governed by the Section 404 permit program. See 33
U.S.C. § 1344. Section 404 authorizes the Corps, rather than EPA, to issue permits when
the regulated activity involves the “discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable
waters at specified disposal sites.” 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a), Nevertheless, EPA plays an
important role in that permitting process, see 33 U.S.C. § 1344(b)-(c). In order for the
federal government to have Section 404 jurisdiction over an activity in wetlands, therefore,
there must be a “discharge of dredged or fill material” into “navigable waters.”
Triggers for 404 Jurisdiction



there is a discharge of dredged or fill material
into the navigable waters

When wetlands are ditched, drained, filled or otherwise altered, several of the prerequisites for regulation under sections 301 and 404 are easily met.
73

Point source: For instance, the Clean Water Act defines
“point source” very broadly as “any discernible, confined and
discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe,
ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure,
container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding
operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which
pollutants are or may be discharged.” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(14).
Ditching, draining, or filling activities in wetlands usually
involve heavy construction equipment, such as backhoes,
excavators, or loaders, which clearly are “discernible,
confined and discrete
conveyances.”

ki/File:Case_backhoe_loader.jpg
[CC-BY-2.0]

Pollutant: Similarly, the statute defines “pollutant” to
include “dredged spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue,
sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical
wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat,
wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt
and industrial, municipal, and agricultural waste
discharged into water.” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(6). Normally,
activities impacting wetlands involve the placement, in
wetlands, of rocks, soil, silt, organic debris or similar
materials, all of which fit comfortably within the definition
of “pollutant.”

Person: The statute also defines “person” very broadly to include “an individual,
corporation, partnership, association, State, municipality, commission, or political
subdivision of a State, or any interstate body.” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(5). As a result, when
wetlands are ditched, drained, filled or otherwise altered, it is normally not very difficult to
demonstrate that the activity was undertaken by a “person.”
Consequently, whether Section 301 prohibits ditching, draining, filling or otherwise
impairing wetlands usually depends on whether the activity at issue involves an addition of
a pollutant and whether the wetlands at issue are navigable waters. Similarly, whether the
federal government has jurisdiction under Section 404 over such activities impacting
wetlands usually depends on whether the activity involves a discharge of dredged or fill
material and whether the wetlands at issue are navigable waters. Section II of this
Chapter examines the scope of the federal government’s jurisdiction over navigable
waters at length, and Chapter 5 focuses on which activities in wetlands have been held to
involve the addition of pollutants or the discharge of dredged or fill material.
As Section II of this Chapter will describe, the Corps and EPA have defined the statutory
term “navigable waters” to include certain wetlands. Before turning to a closer examination
74

of the scope of federal jurisdiction over navigable waters, therefore, it may be helpful to
examine the federal government’s regulatory approach to defining and identifying wetlands
in more detail.
C.

Identifying and Delineating Wetlands

Definitions: Although the Clean Water Act does not include a statutory definition for
“wetlands,” both EPA and the Corps have adopted regulations that define “wetlands” as
follows:
those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency
and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a
prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands
generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

33 C.F.R. § 328.3 (b) (Corps’ regulations); 40 C.F.R. § 230.3(t) (EPA’s regulations).
While that definition is the primary definition of wetlands for purposes of the Clean Water
Act, there are a few other definitions used by other agencies that have some responsibility
over wetlands under the Clean Water Act. As noted in Chapter 2, the Fish and Wildlife
Service has some responsibilities regarding wetlands under the Clean Water Act and
several other federal statutes. In administering a National Wetlands Inventory, the Fish and
Wildlife Service uses a definition of “wetlands” that is similar, but not identical, to the
definition adopted by EPA and the Corps. Specifically, the Service defines wetlands as
“lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually
at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. For purposes of this
classification, wetlands must have one or more of the following three attributes: (1) at least
periodically, the land supports predominantly hydrophytes, (2) the substrate is
predominantly undrained hydric soil, and (3) the substrate is nonsoil and is saturated with
water or covered by shallow water at some time during the growing season of each year.”
L. Cowardin, et al., U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Classification
of Wetlands and Deep-Water Habitats of the United States (1979). In addition, the Natural
Resources Conservation Service regulates wetlands under the Food Security Act, which
has a similar, though not identical, statutory definition for wetlands, see 16 U.S.C. §
3801(27), but that agency also has some regulatory responsibilities over wetlands on
agricultural lands under the Clean Water Act, as discussed below.
Chapter 1 of this book described the scientific bases for determining whether a particular
geographic area constitutes a wetland (i.e. the presence of specific types of soils,
vegetation and hydrology) and outlined the delineation process that is used to identify the
boundaries of wetlands. Not surprisingly, the federal regulatory definitions focus on the
75

three characteristics of wetlands that are central to delineation - vegetation, soils, and
hydrology. Because the regulatory definition of wetlands adopted by EPA and the Corps
may seem a little difficult to apply to a specific piece of property without further clarification,
the federal agencies with jurisdiction over wetlands have provided guidance over the years
to help staff and the regulated community determine the scope of the definition.
Delineation manuals: In 1987, the Corps adopted a Wetlands Delineation Manual that
outlined tests and procedures that agency staff could use to determine whether a particular
geographic area had the vegetation, soils and hydrology necessary to be classified as a
wetland. The manual was a guidance document, rather than a rule, so it was not adopted
pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking. In 1988, EPA adopted a different manual,
also as a guidance document, which used different tests and procedures to delineate
wetlands. W.S. Sipple, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Wetland Identification and
Delineation Manual (1988). The EPA manual included a test that relied heavily on an
analysis of vegetation for sites of 15 acres or less. Ralph W. Tiner, WETLAND
INDICATORS: A GUIDE TO WETLAND IDENTIFICATION, DELINEATION,
CLASSIFICATION, AND MAPPING 208-209 (CRC Press 1999). Adding to the confusion,
at the time, the Fish and Wildlife Service had its own procedures for identifying wetlands,
based on the Cowardin definition outlined above, as did the Soil Conservation Service,
which regulated wetlands under the Food Security Act. See Soil Conservation Service, U.S.
Department of Agriculture, National Food Security Act Manual (1985). (Note: The Soil
Conservation Service became the Natural Resources Conservation Service in a 1994
USDA reorganization.)
In order to eliminate the confusion caused by the sometimes conflicting guidance
documents, in 1989, EPA, the Corps, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Soil
Conservation Service developed a uniform manual for delineating wetlands, see Fish and
Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of the Army, Soil
Conservation Service, Federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional
Wetlands (1989). Like the predecessor documents, the interagency manual was a
guidance document, rather than a rule, and was adopted outside of the notice and
comment rulemaking process. Shortly after its adoption, the interagency manual was
criticized by landowners and organizations who claimed that the manual would expand
jurisdiction to cover a much broader universe of areas as wetlands. See National Research
Council, Wetlands: Characteristics and Boundaries 2 (The National Academies Press,
1995).
Because the manual was adopted informally, landowners challenged the use of the manual
on the grounds that it was a legislative rule that was adopted in violation of the APA’s
notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures and was, therefore, invalid. The United States
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit addressed that issue in the following case:

Unedited opinion (From Justia)

PER CURIAM:

These appeals arise from a civil
enforcement action brought by the Environmental Protection Agency for alleged violations
of the Clean Water Act ("CWA"), * * * by Phillip and Dorothy Hobbs as well as the couple's
son and daughter-in-law, Paul and Donna Hobbs. The violations stem from the clearing,
draining, and constructing of roads on approximately 50 acres of alleged wetlands to create
hay fields. All of the Hobbses were subjected to penalties for violations of the CWA by the
district court. The Hobbses appeal the district court's decision on various grounds. Finding
none of their arguments persuasive, we affirm the district court's decision.
I.
A.
A brief review of the statute is necessary for an understanding of the law of this case. The
Clean Water Act is a comprehensive statute designed to "restore and maintain the
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." CWA § 101(a)(2) * * *
77

In accordance with this mandate, the Act bars the discharge of pollutants into waters of the
United States except in compliance with a permit issued under the Act. CWA § 301(a) * * *
The term pollutant includes dredged and fill material consisting of soil, rock, and sand.
CWA § 404 * * * The Hobbses do not contest that their discharge material fits within the
definition of a pollutant.
The term "waters of the United States" is not explicitly defined under the statute. The Act
does define "navigable waters," however, as waters of the United States. 33 U.S.C. §
1362(7). * * *
"Waters of the United States" is also defined as waters adjacent to other waters of the
nation. 40 C.F.R. § 230.3(s); United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121
(1985). EPA defines "adjacent" as bordering, contiguous, or neighboring. 40 C.F.R. §
230.3(a). Moreover, wetlands separated from other waters of the United States by "manmade dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes and the like are 'adjacent
wetlands'" according to the EPA. 40 C.F.R. § 230.3(b). Finally, both the EPA and the Army
Corps of Engineers ("Corps") define wetlands as:
those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a
frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances
do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
40 C.F.R. § 230(t); 33 C.F.R. § 328(b).
The EPA is authorized under the Act to issue a Finding of Violation and a Compliance
Order for any violation of CWA § 301(a). 33 U.S.C. § 1319(a). Moreover, EPA may
commence a civil action for appropriate relief for a violation of CWA § 301(a).
For the instant case, there are two relevant manuals for wetlands determinations, one
produced by the EPA and the other by the Corps. Both manuals are used to aid in the
determination of what constitutes wetlands. Each manual relies on three parameters to
make a determination: hydrology, vegetation, and soils. The Corps of Engineers
Delineation Manual was adopted in 1987. The EPA manual was adopted April 1988. There
is also an interagency manual, adopted by the EPA and the Corps, which was adopted
January 10, 1989. The joint manual, like the EPA manual, uses the three parameter test in
a manner that expands the definition of wetlands. The jury was allowed to consider the
multiparameter standard in each of the manuals.

78

II
Phillip and Dorothy Hobbs own about 169 acres in Ware Neck, Gloucester County, Virginia.
The Hobbses' son and daughter-in-law, Paul and Donna, also own 37 acres in the county.
The combined property contains approximately 206 acres ("Hobbses' property"). The jury
found this parcel to be wetlands adjacent to the Ware River.
The Hobbses cleared, drained, and constructed roads on approximately 50 acres of
wetlands to create hay fields. In the process, the elder Hobbs discharged, dredged, or filled
material onto their wetlands in 1980, 1984, and 1985. The younger Hobbs did the same in
1986, 1987, and 1988. The Hobbses, however, did not apply for a § 404 permit from the
Corps, as required by the CWA.
The Hobbses contend that they did not apply for a permit because they were under the
impression that they were not required to do so. On September 29, 1988 an official of the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("FWS") went to the Hobbses property and told Paul Hobbs
they might be doing work on nontidal wetlands. The FWS official arranged a site visit by a
Corps official. The Hobbses contend they overheard the two men talking and expressing
doubt about whether the land was in fact wetlands. When Paul Hobbs asked about the
property, the Corps official stated that "it was a grey area of enforcement for the Corps of
Engineers ... and he didn't see where the [Hobbses] had ... done anything wrong."
Moreover, the Corps employee told the Hobbses that he would get back to them about
whether their land was wetlands; but he never told them whether the property was wetlands
nor did the official tell them about a permit.
EPA issued the Hobbses a Findings of Violation and Compliance Order, or Administrative
Order, on March 23, 1989. EPA subsequently amended the order on April 25, 1989.
III
On April 25, 1989, the Hobbses filed a complaint challenging the EPA's Findings of
Violation and Compliance Order issued against them under § 404. On May 4, 1989, the
district court issued a preliminary injunction allowing the Hobbses to continue to farm that
portion of the land previously converted to hayfields. * * *
[At the trial level, EPA then filed a counterclaim against the Hobbses for illegally filling the
wetlands and the court dismissed the Hobbses complaint against EPA. On EPA’s
counterclaim, a jury found that the Hobbses discharged pollutants onto wetlands on their
land in violation of the Clean Water Act. The court allowed the defendants to continue to
grow hay on the parcels that they had previously converted to hay fields, but ordered them
to pay $300 in civil penalties and required them to take various actions to restore and/or
preserve the other wetlands on their property. The defendants appealed the court’s
decision on several grounds, including an argument that the delineation manual(s) used by
79

the government were substantive rules that were invalid because they were not adopted in
accordance with the APA.]
IV
A
***
The second issue is whether the EPA's wetlands delineation manuals are interpretive
guidance documents or substantive rules with binding legal effect in the determination of
what constitutes wetlands under 40 C.F.R. § 230(t) and 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(b). Closely
related to this matter is the question of whether the EPA Manual constitutes substantive
rules subject to the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA") notice and comment
requirements, 5 U.S.C. § 553.
The Hobbses contend that the EPA manual represents substantive rules subject to the
public notice and comment requirements under the APA. Their argument in effect is the
manual does not merely clarify and explain the process of wetlands determination, but
rather expands federal jurisdiction.
Whether the manual is subject to APA depends on whether it constitutes interpretive rules
or substantive rules. The former rules " 'are those which merely clarify or explain existing
law or regulations,' and 'do not have the full force and effect of a substantive rule but [are]
in the form of an explanation of particular terms.' " American Hospital Ass'n v. Bowen, 834
F.2d 1037, 1045 (D.C. Cir.1987) (citations omitted). In Jerri's Ceramic Arts v. Consumer
Products Safety Comm'n, 874 F.2d 205 (4th Cir.1989), we noted the distinction between
the two rules:
An interpretive rule simply state[s] what the administrative agency thinks the statute
means, and only "remind[s]" affected parties of existing duties ... [while] a
substantive or legislative rule has the force of law, and creates new law or imposes
new rights or duties.
Id., 207. Moreover, this court held that in determining whether a rule was interpretive or
substantive courts must consider the agency's intent. Id., at 208.
The intent behind the manuals and absence of the force of law make it clear that they are
interpretive rules. The EPA manual states in its preface that it was "developed to address
the need for operational and jurisdictional guidance." Moreover, the manual states that the
methods offered for wetlands determinations "are the recommended approaches."
While the EPA manual does not possess the force of law, the EPA manual does represent
80

a significant change in the definition and an expansion of jurisdiction. The change in
definition, however, is premised upon the making of certain scientific assumptions
regarding the presence of the three parameters for a wetlands determination. The Hobbses
point to nothing in the record to suggest any explicitly political motivation or policy
consideration behind the change in the parameter test. Without a showing of intent or legal
force, the manuals are no more than interpretive rules.
Questions and Comments
1.

What procedures does the APA require agencies to follow when adopting
interpretative rules? How do those procedures differ from the procedures required
for substantive (legislative) rules?

2.

Are interpretative rules entitled to Chevron deference? Do they carry the force of
law? Why might the agencies have preferred to adopt the delineation manuals as
interpretative rules, as opposed to substantive (legislative) rules?

3.

Is an agency’s characterization of a rule as “interpretative” or “substantive” outcome
determinative? How does this court determine what type of “rule” EPA has adopted?

4.

Remember that several federal agencies have jurisdiction over various aspects of
wetlands regulation under the Clean Water Act and other statutes. Note that the
violation in this case was first identified by a representative of the Fish and Wildlife
Service, who arranged a visit by a representative of the Corps of Engineers, but that
the enforcement action in the case was brought by EPA. Note, too, that the
representatives of the various agencies appeared to view the severity of the
violation differently. One of the defendants in the case argued that the government
should be estopped from prosecuting him because he constructed the drainage
ditches on the property under the supervision of and according to the design
specifications of two Soil Conservation Service employees. The court addressed
that argument in a separate portion of the opinion. How do you think the court
should have ruled? See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S.
414 (1990).

5.

As Chapter 10 will explore more fully, the government does not need to prove that a
defendant acted intentionally, or with any mental state, to prevail in a civil
enforcement action under the Clean Water Act. Nevertheless, the government, and
courts, are likely to consider the defendant’s mental state when determining the
severity of the penalties for violating the Act. Does it appear that the trial court
considered the Hobbses mental state in determining the penalty for the defendant’s
conduct?

81

More Manuals: In 1991, the Corps and EPA developed updates to the 1989 manual and
began a rulemaking process to adopt a new manual. See 56 Fed. Reg. 40,446 (Aug. 14,
1991). The 1991 proposal generated controversy when critics argued that it was grounded
more in politics than science and would significantly narrow jurisdiction over wetlands.
Environmental groups claimed that 30-80% of the areas regulated as wetlands under the
1989 manual would be excluded from regulation under the proposed 1991 manual. See
Heimlich, R.E., K.D. Wiebe, R. Claassen, D. Gadsby and R.M. House, Economic Research
Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Wetlands and Agriculture: Private Interests and
Public Benefits, Agricultural Economic Report No. 765 (1998). The agencies ultimately
abandoned the proposed rulemaking.
In response to criticism of the 1989 manual and concerns about the process that the
agencies were using to develop the delineation manuals, in 1992, Congress included a
rider in appropriations legislation for the Corps that prohibited the Corps from utilizing the
1989 interagency manual or any other manual adopted after the 1989 manual unless the
manual was adopted pursuant to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. See Energy
and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 102-377, 106 Stat, 1315
(1992). In light of the legislation, the Corps returned to using its 1987 delineation manual to
delineate wetlands under the Clean Water Act. Although the legislation did not apply to
EPA, EPA also decided to use the Corps’ 1987 manual to delineate wetlands under the
Clean Water Act at that time. The Natural Resources Conservation Service, however,
returned to its own National Food Security Act Manual.
In 1995, the National Academy of Sciences released a report on characterizing wetlands,
see National Research Council, Wetlands: Characteristics and Boundaries (The National
Academies Press, 1995) (“NAS Study”), that was prepared in response to a federal law that
required the Academy to prepare such a study to assist in the development of a new
federal wetlands delineation manual. See Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing
and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1993, Pub. L.
No. 102-389, 106 Stat. 1571 (1992). The report included a series of recommendations
improving the 1987 Corps’ manual, but also found that the approach that the agencies were
using under that manual was scientifically sound. See NAS Study, supra, at 12.
Although the National Academy of Sciences study suggested that there was a need for a
“more efficient, more uniform, ... and more accurate” approach to delineating wetlands, id.,
EPA and the Corps still use the Corps’ 1987 delineation manual to delineate wetlands
under the Clean Water Act. However, following up on recommendations in a 2002 Corps
report, see James S. Wakeley, Developing a Regionalized Version of the Corps of
Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual: Issues and Recommendations, ERDC/EL TR-0220 (Aug. 2002), the Corps adopted a series of 10 regional supplements to the delineation
manual, with procedures and tests tailored to the specific vegetation, soils and hydrology
conditions of each region. See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Regional Supplements to

Division of authority for determining jurisdiction: As will be described more fully in
Chapters 6 and 10, EPA plays an important role in the permitting process with the Corps
and both agencies have enforcement authority under the Clean Water Act. In order to
establish efficient coordination between the agencies in making jurisdictional
determinations under the Act, EPA and the Corps entered into a Memorandum of
Agreement in 1989, see Memorandum of Agreement Between the Department of the Army
and the Environmental Protection Agency Concerning the Determination of the Section 404
Permit Program and the Application of the Exemptions Under Section 404(f) of the Clean
Water Act (Jan. 19, 1989)(MOA), that gave the Corps the responsibility for performing “the
majority of the geographic jurisdictional determinations” and provided that the Corps’
determinations would be binding on the Government. The MOA did, however, authorize
EPA to make jurisdictional determinations in “special cases” and recognized that EPA
would be the lead agency in developing guidance on determining jurisdiction under the Act.
Id. Because the agencies entered into the agreement in 1989, the MOA provided that the
agencies would make determinations using the 1989 interagency delineation manual. Id. In
1993, the agencies amended the MOA to provide that determinations would be made using
the 1987 Corps delineation manual, but left the rest of the agreement intact. See 58 Fed.
Reg. 4995 (Jan. 19, 1993). While most jurisdictional determinations are covered by those
MOAs, the Natural Resources Conservation Service takes the lead on delineating wetlands
for purposes of the Food Security Act and delineates them using its own manual. See
Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Defense, Department of Agriculture,
Department of Interior, Interagency Memorandum of Agreement Concerning Wetlands
Determinations for Purposes of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Subtitle B of the
Food Security Act, (Jan. 6, 1994).
While the government agencies are ultimately responsible for determining the geographic
limits of wetlands jurisdiction, landowners frequently retain consultants to delineate the
wetland boundaries on their property in accordance with the 1987 Corps manual prior to
seeking an official jurisdictional determination from the government. States and
professional organizations, such as the Society of Wetlands Scientists, provide training and
certification for wetlands delineators, see Leah Stetson, Association of State Wetlands
Managers, State Wetland Delineator Certification Programs, Wetland News (June-July
2007), but there is not a national certification program. An official jurisdictional
determination, though, can be made only by the government. While the Corps and EPA rely
on the same scientific tests to delineate wetlands nationwide, a 2004 General Accounting
Office Report determined that those criteria are interpreted and applied unevenly by the
various Corps district offices. See General Accounting Office, Corps of Engineers Needs to
Evaluate its District Office Practices in Determining Jurisdiction GAO–04–297 (Feb. 2004).

Types of Jurisdictional Determinations: The Corps issues two types of jurisdictional
determinations - “preliminary jurisdictional determinations” and “approved jurisdictional
determinations.” See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jurisdictional Determinations,
Regulatory Guidance Letter 08-02 (June 26, 2008) (hereinafter “RGL 08-02"). A
“preliminary jurisdictional determination” is non-binding, cannot be appealed, and can be
used only to indicate that there may be wetlands or waters on a piece of property. See 33
C.F.R. § 331.2. It cannot be used to indicate that wetlands or waters are not present. See
RGL 08-02, §8. Landowners might seek preliminary jurisdictional determinations to waive
questions regarding jurisdiction and move ahead expeditiously to obtain a development
permit or the Corps might use a preliminary jurisdictional determination as the basis for a
compliance order when site access may be impractical or unauthorized or in other
circumstances when it is not possible to complete an approved jurisdictional determination
in a timely manner. Id. § 4.
An “approved jurisdictional determination” is an official determination that “wetlands,”
“waters of the United States,” or “navigable waters” are present on the property or are not
present on the property. See 33 C.F.R. § 331.2. The “approved jurisdictional determination”
precisely identifies the boundaries of those waters. Id. “Approved jurisdictional
determinations” are valid for five years and can be challenged administratively. See RGL
08-02 §2.
While jurisdictional determinations can be challenged administratively, courts have
generally held that they are not “final agency actions” and are not, therefore, subject to
judicial review. See, e.g., Southern Pines Associates v. United States, 912 F.2d 713 (4th
Cir. 1990); Hoffman Group, Inc. V. EPA, 902 F.2d 567 (7th Cir. 1990). It is not yet clear,
though, whether the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. EPA, 132 S. Ct. 1367 (2012),
will change that. Although the jurisdictional determinations have, historically, not been
subject to immediate judicial challenge, the determinations can be challenged when the
Corps makes a final decision on a permit application that incorporates the determination, or
when the government brings an enforcement action based on the determination. See
Chapter 10.

Many of the Corps Districts post approved jurisdictional determinations on their websites, as
noted above. Browse one of the Corps District’s websites to find an approved jurisdictional
determination where the Corps has determined that there are wetlands on the property that are
waters of the United States, but where the wetlands are not adjacent to traditional navigable
waters (TNWs). For that jurisdictional determination, please identify (1) the District; (2) the file
number; and (3) the acreage of wetlands that qualify as waters of the United States. In addition,
briefly summarize the connection between the wetlands and traditional navigable waters and the
factors that demonstrate that the wetlands have a significant nexus to traditional navigable
waters.

Hypothetical
Clarissa Darrow is an attorney with the EPA in the Atlanta Regional Office and has been
contacted by an EPA investigator in the Water Branch of the Office regarding the illegal
discharge of fill material into wetlands near Naples, Florida by the Valencia Citrus Company.
Elvin Kagan, the corporate counsel for the Valencia Citrus Company, informed Darrow that
before expanding their orchards last year, Valencia contracted with Carl Kramer as a consultant
to delineate their property and determine whether there were any wetlands on the property that
Valencia planned to develop. Kagan insisted that Valencia did not add any fill material to
wetlands on the property until Kramer informed them that the wetlands were not “waters of the
United States.” If EPA has not yet instituted any enforcement proceedings against Valencia, and
if Kramer is not independently represented by an attorney, may Darrow contact Kramer and
question him without seeking approval from Kagan, as long as Kramer consents to the meeting?
Could Darrow contact Kramer and question him if he were an employee of the Valencia Fruit
Company? See American Bar Association, Model Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 and 4.3 (and

II.

Waters of the United States

A.

The Corps’ Initial Interpretation

The scope of waters, including wetlands, that have been subject to jurisdiction under the
Clean Water Act has ebbed and flowed over the years. The statute does not explicitly
indicate that it covers wetlands. As noted above, the statute regulates various activities in
“navigable waters,” which Congress defined as “waters of the United States, including the
territorial seas.” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(7). When the Corps first adopted rules to define the term
“navigable waters,” it used the definition that it had been using under the Rivers and
Harbors Act. See 37 Fed. Reg. 18289 (Sep. 9, 1972).
1974 Corps definition of “navigable waters”
The term "navigable waters of the United States" and "navigable waters,"
as used herein mean those waters of the United States which are subject to
the ebb and flow of the tide, and/or are presently, or have been in the past,
or may be In the future susceptible for use for purposes of interstate or
foreign commerce. 33 C.F.R. 209.210(d)(1), 39 Fed. Reg. 12115 (April 3,
1974).
Under that definition, “navigable” really meant “navigable.” In order to be a navigable water,
the water had to be:




currently navigable;
historically navigable; or
potentially navigable

The Corps’ “navigable waters” definition was derived, historically, from a test established by
the Supreme Court over one hundred years earlier in The Daniel Ball, 77 U.S. 557 (1870).
In that case, the Court rejected the British common law approach that defined navigability
based on the ebb and flow of the tide, and adopted a definition that focused on whether the
waters “are used, or are susceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as highways
for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary
modes of trade and travel on water.” 77 U.S. 563. The tie to commerce was significant, so
the mere fact that one could float a canoe on the water was not dispositive if the water
could not at least potentially be used as a highway of commerce for trade or travel. (For a
primer on “navigability” prepared by American Whitewater, click here.)

Environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, felt that the
Corps’ regulatory interpretation of “navigable waters” was too narrow and that Congress
intended to regulate a broader range of waters under the Clean Water Act than were
regulated under the Rivers and Harbors Act. Accordingly, NRDC sued the Corps, and the
Federal District Court for the District of Columbia issued the following decision.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Callaway

granted; and it is DECLARED that: * * *
Congress by defining the term ' navigable waters' in Section 502(7) of the [Clean Water Act]
to mean 'the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,' asserted federal
jurisdiction over the nation's waters to the maximum extent permissible under the
Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Accordingly, as used in the [Clean] Water Act, the
term is not limited to the traditional tests of navigability. * * *

Questions and Comments
1.

Subsequent decisions examining the regulatory definition of “waters of the United
States” frequently invoke the Chevron analysis, which accords agency rulemaking a
degree of deference. Why did the Court not use that analysis in this case, and would
the case have come out differently if the Court had used the Chevron analysis?

2.

Would the deadlines that the court gave the agency to adopt proposed and final
rules to define “navigable waters” be realistic today?

3.

If the Court upheld the Corps’ regulatory definition of “navigable waters,” would
many wetlands be regulated under the Clean Water Act?

4.

How broad was the Corps’ jurisdiction over “waters” after this decision? What limits
did the Court impose on the Corps’ authority to regulate waters? Would “navigable
waters” need to be “navigable”?

B.

Expanded Jurisdiction, Adjacent Wetlands and Riverside-Bayview Homes

In response to the court’s decision in N.R.D.C. v. Callaway, the Corps amended its
regulations to significantly broaden the definition of “navigable waters” under the Clean
Water Act to advance the water quality protection purposes of the statute, as opposed to
the navigability goals of the Rivers and Harbors Act. In 1975, the agency issued interim
final regulations that included not only the traditional “navigable waters” that were regulated
88

under the Rivers and Harbors Act, but also tributaries of those waters and “coastal
wetlands” or “freshwater wetlands” that were contiguous to, or adjacent to, traditional
navigable waters. See 40 Fed. Reg. 31320 (July 25, 1975). The 1975 regulations marked
the first time that the Corps defined “navigable waters” under the Clean Water Act to
include wetlands. The new regulations also asserted jurisdiction over intrastate lakes, rivers
and streams (even if not traditionally navigable) if they were utilized in various ways for
interstate commerce. Thus, while the regulations broadened the categories of waters within
the Corps’ jurisdiction, the agency limited its jurisdiction to waters with ties to interstate
commerce.
In 1982, the Corps refined its regulations but did not significantly expand jurisdiction.
Because the Clean Water Act defines “navigable waters” as “waters of the United States,”
the Corps adopted a regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” that included the
following waters:








the traditional navigable waters regulated under the 1974 regulations (33 C.F.R. §
323.2(a)(1));
interstate waters and interstate wetlands (33 C.F.R. § 323.2(a)(2));
intrastate waters the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate
or foreign commerce (33 C.F.R. § 323.2(a)(3));
impoundments of water otherwise defined as waters of the United States under the
definition (33 C.F.R. § 323.2(a)(4));
tributaries of waters identified in paragraphs (a)(1) - (4) (33 C.F.R. § 323.2(a)(5));
the territorial sea (33 C.F.R. § 323.2(a)(6)); and
wetlands adjacent to waters (other than waters that are themselves wetlands)
identified in paragraphs (a)(1)-(6) (33 C.F.R. § 323.2(a)(7))

See 33 C.F.R. § 323 (1982).
Those rules were challenged in the following case, which made it to the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1985.

This case presents the question whether the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et
seq., together with certain regulations promulgated under its authority by the Army Corps of
89

Engineers, authorizes the Corps to require landowners to obtain permits from the Corps
before discharging fill material into wetlands adjacent to navigable bodies of water and their
tributaries.

I
The relevant provisions of the Clean Water Act originated in the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 816, and have remained essentially unchanged
since that time. Under §§ 301 and 502 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311 and 1362, any
discharge of dredged or fill materials into "navigable waters" -- defined as the "waters of the
United States" -- is forbidden unless authorized by a permit issued by the Corps of
Engineers pursuant to § 404, 33 U.S.C. § 1344. * * * After initially construing the Act to
cover only waters navigable in fact, in 1975 the Corps issued interim final regulations
redefining "the waters of the United States" to include not only actually navigable waters but
also tributaries of such waters, interstate waters and their tributaries, and nonnavigable
intrastate waters whose use or misuse could affect interstate commerce. 40 Fed.Reg.
31320 (1975). More importantly for present purposes, the Corps construed the Act to cover
all "freshwater wetlands" that were adjacent to other covered waters. A "freshwater
wetland" was defined as an area that is "periodically inundated" and is "normally
characterized by the prevalence of vegetation that requires saturated soil conditions for
growth and reproduction." 33 C.F.R. § 209.120(d)(2)(h) (1976). In 1977, the Corps refined
its definition of wetlands by eliminating the reference to periodic inundation and making
other minor changes. The 1977 definition reads as follows:
"The term 'wetlands' means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface
or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under
normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for
life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs
and similar areas."
33 C.F.R. § 323.2(c) (1978).
In 1982, the 1977 regulations were replaced by substantively identical regulations that
remain in force today. See 33 C.F.R. § 323.2 (1985).2 Respondent Riverside Bayview
Homes, Inc. (hereafter respondent), owns 80 acres of low-lying, marshy land near the
shores of Lake St. Clair in Macomb County, Michigan. In 1976, respondent began to place
fill materials on its property as part of its preparations for construction of a housing
development. The Corps of Engineers, believing that the property was an "adjacent
wetland" under the 1975 regulation defining "waters of the United States," filed suit in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking to enjoin
2

The regulations also cover certain wetlands not necessarily adjacent to other waters.
See 33 C.F.R. §§ 323.2(a)(2) and (3) (1985). These provisions are not now before us.

respondent from filling the property without the permission of the Corps.
The District Court held that the portion of respondent's property lying below 575.5 feet
above sea level was a covered wetland, and enjoined respondent from filling it without a
permit. * * * Respondent appealed, and the Court of Appeals remanded for consideration
of the effect of the intervening 1977 amendments to the regulation. * * * On remand, the
District Court again held the property to be a wetland subject to the Corps' permit authority.
***
Respondent again appealed, and the Sixth Circuit reversed. * * * . The court construed the
Corps' regulation to exclude from the category of adjacent wetlands -- and hence from that
of "waters of the United States" -- wetlands that were not subject to flooding by adjacent
navigable waters at a frequency sufficient to support the growth of aquatic vegetation. The
court adopted this construction of the regulation because, in its view, a broader definition of
wetlands might result in the taking of private property without just compensation. The court
also expressed its doubt that Congress, in granting the Corps jurisdiction to regulate the
filling of "navigable waters," intended to allow regulation of wetlands that were not the result
of flooding by navigable waters. * * * Under the court's reading of the regulation,
respondent's property was not within the Corps' jurisdiction, because its semiaquatic
characteristics were not the result of frequent flooding by the nearby navigable waters.
Respondent was therefore free to fill the property without obtaining a permit.
We granted certiorari to consider the proper interpretation of the Corps' regulation defining
"waters of the United States" and the scope of the Corps' jurisdiction under the Clean
Water Act, both of which were called into question by the Sixth Circuit's ruling.
* * * We now reverse.

II
The question whether the Corps of Engineers may demand that respondent obtain a permit
before placing fill material on its property is primarily one of regulatory and statutory
interpretation: we must determine whether respondent's property is an "adjacent wetland"
within the meaning of the applicable regulation, and, if so, whether the Corps' jurisdiction
over "navigable waters" gives it statutory authority to regulate discharges of fill material into
such a wetland. In this connection, we first consider the Court of Appeals' position that the
Corps' regulatory authority under the statute and its implementing regulations must be
narrowly construed to avoid a taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth
Amendment.
[The Court then held that neither the imposition of a permit requirement by the Clean Water
Act nor the denial of a permit would necessarily constitute a taking. Accordingly, the Court
held that it was not necessary to interpret the statute narrowly to avoid takings concerns.]

91

***

III
Purged of its spurious constitutional overtones, the question whether the regulation at issue
requires respondent to obtain a permit before filling its property is an easy one. The
regulation extends the Corps' authority under § 404 to all wetlands adjacent to navigable or
interstate waters and their tributaries. Wetlands, in turn, are defined as lands that are
"inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to
support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation
typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions." 33 C.F.R. § 323.2(c) (195) (emphasis
added). The plain language of the regulation refutes the Court of Appeals' conclusion that
inundation or "frequent flooding" by the adjacent body of water is a sine qua non of a
wetland under the regulation. Indeed, the regulation could hardly state more clearly that
saturation by either surface or ground water is sufficient to bring an area within the category
of wetlands, provided that the saturation is sufficient to, and does, support wetland
vegetation. The history of the regulation underscores the absence of any requirement of
inundation. The interim final regulation that the current regulation replaced explicitly
included a requirement of "periodi[c] inundation." 33 C.F.R. § 209.120(d)(2)(h) (1976). In
deleting the reference to "periodic inundation" from the regulation as finally promulgated,
the Corps explained that it was repudiating the interpretation of that language "as requiring
inundation over a record period of years." 42 Fed. Reg. 37128 (1977). In fashioning its own
requirement of "frequent flooding" the Court of Appeals improperly reintroduced into the
regulation precisely what the Corps had excised. * * * Without the nonexistent requirement
of frequent flooding, the regulatory definition of adjacent wetlands covers the property here.
The District Court found that respondent's property was "characterized by the presence of
vegetation that requires saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction," * * * and
that the source of the saturated soil conditions on the property was groundwater. There is
no plausible suggestion that these findings are clearly erroneous, and they plainly bring the
property within the category of wetlands as defined by the current regulatio In addition, the
court found that the wetland located on respondent's property was adjacent to a body of
navigable water, since the area characterized by saturated soil conditions and wetland
vegetation extended beyond the boundary of respondent's property to Black Creek, a
navigable waterway. Again, the court's finding is not clearly erroneous. Together, these
findings establish that respondent's property is a wetland adjacent to a navigable waterway.
Hence, it is part of the "waters of the United States" as defined by 33 C.F.R. § 323.2
(1985), and if the regulation itself is valid as a construction of the term "waters of the United
States" as used in the Clean Water Act, a question which we now address, the property
falls within the scope of the Corps' jurisdiction over "navigable waters" under § 404 of the
Act.

92

IV
A
An agency's construction of a statute it is charged with enforcing is entitled to deference if it
is reasonable and not in conflict with the expressed intent of Congress. Chemical
Manufacturers Assn. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 470 U.S.116, 125 (1985);
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S.837, 842-845
(1984). Accordingly, our review is limited to the question whether it is reasonable, in light of
the language, policies, and legislative history of the Act, for the Corps to exercise
jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to, but not regularly flooded by, rivers, streams, and
other hydrographic features more conventionally identifiable as "waters." 8
On a purely linguistic level, it may appear unreasonable to classify "lands," wet or
otherwise, as "waters." Such a simplistic response, however, does justice neither to the
problem faced by the Corps in defining the scope of its authority under § 404(a) nor to the
realities of the problem of water pollution that the Clean Water Act was intended to combat.
In determining the limits of its power to regulate discharges under the Act, the Corps must
necessarily choose some point at which water ends and land begins. Our common
experience tells us that this is often no easy task: the transition from water to solid ground
is not necessarily or even typically an abrupt one. Rather, between open waters and dry
land may lie shallows, marshes, mudflats, swamps, bogs -- in short, a huge array of areas
that are not wholly aquatic but nevertheless fall far short of being dry land. Where on this
continuum to find the limit of "waters" is far from obvious. Faced with such a problem of
defining the bounds of its regulatory authority, an agency may appropriately look to the
legislative history and underlying policies of its statutory grants of authority. Neither of these
sources provides unambiguous guidance for the Corps in this case, but together they do
support the reasonableness of the Corps' approach of defining adjacent wetlands as
"waters" within the meaning of § 404(a). Section 404 originated as part of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, which constituted a comprehensive
legislative attempt "to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of
the Nation's waters." CWA § 101, 33 U.S.C. § 1251. This objective incorporated a broad,
systemic view of the goal of maintaining and improving water quality: as the House Report
on the legislation put it, "the word integrity' . . . refers to a condition in which the natural
structure and function of ecosystems [are] maintained." H.R.Rep. No. 92911, p. 76 (1972).
Protection of aquatic ecosystems, Congress recognized, demanded broad federal authority
to control pollution, for "[w]ater moves in hydrologic cycles, and it is essential that discharge
8

We are not called upon to address the question of the authority of the Corps to regulate
discharges of fill material into wetlands that are not adjacent to bodies of open water, see
33 C.F.R. §§ 323.2(a)(2) and (3) (1985), and we do not express any opinion on that
question.
93

of pollutants be controlled at the source." S.Rep.No. 92414, p. 77 (1972). In keeping with
these views, Congress chose to define the waters covered by the Act broadly. Although the
Act prohibits discharges into "navigable waters," see CWA §§ 301(a), 404(a), 502(12), 33
U.S.C. §§ 1311(a), 1344(a), 1362(12), the Act's definition of "navigable waters" as "the
waters of the United States" makes it clear that the term “navigable" as used in the Act is of
limited import. In adopting this definition of "navigable waters," Congress evidently intended
to repudiate limits that had been placed on federal regulation by earlier water pollution
control statutes, and to exercise its powers under the Commerce Clause to regulate at least
some waters that would not be deemed "navigable" under the classical understanding of
that term. See S.Conf.Rep. No. 921236, p. 144 (1972); 118 Cong. Rec. 3375633757(1972) (statement of Rep. Dingell). Of course, it is one thing to recognize that
Congress intended to allow regulation of waters that might not satisfy traditional tests of
navigability; it is another to assert that Congress intended to abandon traditional notions of
"waters" and include in that term "wetlands" as well. Nonetheless, the evident breadth of
congressional concern for protection of water quality and aquatic ecosystems suggests that
it is reasonable for the Corps to interpret the term "waters" to encompass wetlands adjacent
to waters as more conventionally defined. Following the lead of the Environmental
Protection Agency, see 38 Fed. Reg. 10834 (1973), the Corps has determined that
wetlands adjacent to navigable waters do, as a general matter, play a key role in protecting
and enhancing water quality:
"The regulation of activities that cause water pollution cannot rely on . . . artificial
lines . . . , but must focus on all waters that together form the entire aquatic system.
[*134] Water moves in hydrologic cycles, and the pollution of this part of the aquatic
system, regardless of whether it is above or below an ordinary high water mark, or
mean high tide line, will affect the water quality of the other waters within that
aquatic system." "For this reason, the landward limit of Federal jurisdiction under
Section 404 must include any adjacent wetlands that form the border of or are in
reasonable proximity to other waters of the United States, as these wetlands are
part of this aquatic system."
42 Fed.Reg. 37128 (1977).
We cannot say that the Corps' conclusion that adjacent wetlands are inseparably bound up
with the "waters" of the United States -- based as it is on the Corps' and EPA's technical
expertise -- is unreasonable. In view of the breadth of federal regulatory authority
contemplated by the Act itself and the inherent difficulties of defining precise bounds to
regulable waters, the Corps' ecological judgment about the relationship between waters
and their adjacent wetlands provides an adequate basis for a legal judgment that adjacent
wetlands may be defined as waters under the Act. This holds true even for wetlands that
are not the result of flooding or permeation by water having its source in adjacent bodies of
open water. The Corps has concluded that wetlands may affect the water quality of
adjacent lakes, rivers, and streams even when the waters of those bodies do not actually
94

inundate the wetlands. For example, wetlands that are not flooded by adjacent waters may
still tend to drain into those waters. In such circumstances, the Corps has concluded that
wetlands may serve to filter and purify water draining into adjacent bodies of water, see 33
C.F.R. § 320.4(b)(2)(vii) (1985), and to slow the flow of surface runoff into lakes, rivers, and
streams, and thus prevent flooding and erosion, see §§ 320.4(b)(2)(iv) and (v). In addition,
adjacent wetlands may
"serve significant natural biological functions, including food chain production,
general habitat, and nesting, spawning, rearing and resting sites for aquatic . . .
species."
§ 320.4(b)(2)(i). In short, the Corps has concluded that wetlands adjacent to lakes, rivers,
streams, and other bodies of water may function as integral parts of the aquatic
environment even when the moisture creating the wetlands does not find its source in the
adjacent bodies of water. Again, we cannot say that the Corps' judgment on these matters
is unreasonable, and we therefore conclude that a definition of "waters of the United
States" encompassing all wetlands adjacent to other bodies of water over which the Corps
has jurisdiction is a permissible interpretation of the Act. Because respondent's property is
part of a wetland that actually abuts on a navigable waterway, respondent was required to
have a permit in this case.9
B
Following promulgation of the Corps' interim final regulations in 1975, the Corps' assertion
of authority under § 404 over waters not actually navigable engendered some
congressional opposition. The controversy came to a head during Congress' consideration
of the Clean Water Act of 1977, a major piece of legislation aimed at achieving "interim
improvements within the existing framework" of the Clean Water Act. H.R.Rep. No. 95139,
pp. 1-2 (1977). In the end, however, as we shall explain, Congress acquiesced in the
administrative construction.

9

Of course, it may well be that not every adjacent wetland is of great importance to the
environment of adjoining bodies of water. But the existence of such cases does not
seriously undermine the Corps' decision to define all adjacent wetlands as "waters." If it is
reasonable for the Corps to conclude that, in the majority of cases, adjacent wetlands have
significant effects on water quality and the aquatic ecosystem, its definition can stand. That
the definition may include some wetlands that are not significantly intertwined with the
ecosystem of adjacent waterways is of little moment, for where it appears that a wetland
covered by the Corps' definition is, in fact, lacking in importance to the aquatic environment,
or where its importance is outweighed by other values the Corps may always allow
development of the wetland for other uses simply by issuing a permit. See 33 C.F.R. §
320.4(b)(4) (1986).
95

[The Court then cited portions of the legislative history of the enactment of the Clean Water
Act of 1977 that demonstrated attempts to narrow the definition of navigable waters in the
statute.]
***
The significance of Congress' treatment of the Corps' § 404 jurisdiction in its consideration
of the Clean Water Act of 1977 is twofold. First, the scope of the Corps' asserted
jurisdiction over wetlands was specifically brought to Congress' attention, and Congress
rejected measures designed to curb the Corps' jurisdiction, in large part because of its
concern that protection of wetlands would be unduly hampered by a narrowed definition of
"navigable waters." Although we are chary of attributing significance to Congress' failure to
act, a refusal by Congress to overrule an agency's construction of legislation is at least
some evidence of the reasonableness of that construction, particularly where the
administrative construction has been brought to Congress' attention through legislation
specifically designed to supplant it. See Bob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S.
574, 599-601 (1983); United States v. Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544, 442 U.S. 554, and n.10
(1979).
Second, it is notable that even those who would have restricted the reach of the Corps'
jurisdiction would have done so not by removing wetlands altogether from the definition of
"waters of the United States," but only by restricting the scope of "navigable waters" under
§ 404 to waters navigable in fact and their adjacent wetlands. In amending the definition of
"navigable waters" for purposes of § 404 only, the backers of the House bill would have left
intact the existing definition of "navigable waters" for purposes of § 301 of the Act, which
generally prohibits discharges of pollutants into navigable waters. As the House Report
explained: "Navigable waters,' as used in section 301, includes all of the waters of the
United States, including their adjacent wetlands." H.R.Rep. No. 95139, p. 24 (1977). Thus,
even those who thought that the Corps' existing authority under § 404 was too broad
recognized (1) that the definition of "navigable waters" then in force for both § 301 and §
404 was reasonably interpreted to include adjacent wetlands, (2) that the water quality
concerns of the Clean Water Act demanded regulation of at least some discharges into
wetlands, and (3) that whatever jurisdiction the Corps would retain over discharges of fill
material after passage of the 1977 legislation should extend to discharges into wetlands
adjacent to any waters over which the Corps retained jurisdiction. These views provide
additional support for a conclusion that Congress in 1977 acquiesced in the Corps'
definition of waters as including adjacent wetlands.
Two features actually included in the legislation that Congress enacted in 1977 also
support the view that the Act authorizes the Corps to regulate discharges into wetlands.
First, in amending § 404 to allow federally approved state permit programs to supplant
regulation by the Corps of certain discharges of fill material, Congress provided that the
States would not be permitted to supersede the Corps' jurisdiction to regulate discharges
96

into actually navigable waters and waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, "including
wetlands adjacent thereto." CWA § 404(g)(1), 33 U.S.C.§ 1344(g)(1). Here, then, Congress
expressly stated that the term "waters" included adjacent wetlands.11 Second, the 1977 Act
authorized an appropriation of $6 million for completion by the Department of Interior of a
"National Wetlands Inventory" to assist the States "in the development and operation of
programs under this Act." CWA § 208(i)(2), 33U.S.C. § 1288(i)(2). The enactment of this
provision reflects congressional recognition that wetlands are a concern of the Clean Water
Act, and supports the conclusion that, in defining the waters covered by the Act to include
wetlands, the Corps is "implementing congressional policy, rather than embarking on a
frolic of its own." Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S.367, 375 (1969).
C
We are thus persuaded that the language, policies, and history of the Clean Water Act
compel a finding that the Corps has acted reasonably in interpreting the Act to require
permits for the discharge of fill material into wetlands adjacent to the "waters of the United
States." The regulation in which the Corps has embodied this interpretation, by its terms,
includes the wetlands on respondent's property within the class of waters that may not be
filled without a permit; and, as we have seen, there is no reason to interpret the regulation
more narrowly than its terms would indicate. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is
Reversed.
Questions and Comments
1.

The Supreme Court reviewed both the legality of the Corps’ regulation and the
legality of the Corps’ interpretation of its regulation. Landmark Supreme Court
administrative law decisions provide that an agency’s interpretation of its own
regulation is controlling unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the
regulation. See Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997); Bowles v. Seminole
Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945). Did the Sixth Circuit use that approach
when reviewing the Corps’ interpretation of “adjacent wetlands”? Does the Supreme
Court cite that precedent or apply that test in reviewing the Corps’ interpretation of
“adjacent” wetlands?

11

To be sure, § 404(g)(1) does not conclusively determine the construction to be placed on
the use of the term "waters" elsewhere in the Act (particularly in § 502(7), which contains
the relevant definition of "navigable waters"); however, in light of the fact that the various
provisions of the Act should be read in pari materia, it does at least suggest strongly that
the term "waters," as used in the Act, does not necessarily exclude "wetlands."
97

2.

Groundwater v. Surface Water: Did the Corps’ regulations require a surface water
connection between wetlands and other waters for the wetlands to be considered
“adjacent” to the waters? Was there a scientific justification for the Corps’
interpretation and did the Court accord that any deference? Keep this in mind when
reading the Supreme Court’s decision in Rapanos v. United States. Incidentally, the
Corps’ current regulations define “adjacent” to mean “bordering, contiguous, or
neighboring” and adjacent wetlands include wetlands “separated from other waters
of the United States by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach
dunes and the like.” See 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(c)

3.

In reviewing the legality of the Corps’ rule that asserted jurisdiction over “adjacent
wetlands,” did the Court apply the Chevron analysis? Did the Court decide the case
at Step 1 or Step 2? It is interesting to compare the Supreme Court’s application of
the Chevron analysis in this case, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Rapanos v. United States.

4.

Navigability and the Commerce Clause: Does the Court conclude that “waters”
must be “navigable” to be regulated under the Clean Water Act? Is the Court’s
articulation of the breadth of the Corps’ jurisdiction under the Act as broad as the
Callaway court’s?

5.

Note the Court’s focus on the purposes of the Clean Water Act and the legislative
history. How does the Corps’ interpretation of the statute advance the purposes of
the statute or advance Congress’ intent? This was a unanimous opinion from the
Court and it is interesting to compare the statutory analysis in this case with the
textualism adopted by the Supreme Court in many cases today.

6.

Legislative Acquiescence: What weight should courts accord to Congress’ failure
to enact legislation that overturns an agency’s rules? Are you persuaded by the
Court’s discussion of Congressional acquiescence?

7.

Values and Functions: Recall our discussion about the values and functions of
wetlands in Chapter 1. The Riverside Bayview court acknowledges those values and
functions in its opinion and defers to the Corps’ scientific judgment in regulating
adjacent wetlands because of the values and functions that they provide to the
adjacent waters. Again, keep this in mind when reading the Supreme Court’s
decision in Rapanos v. United States.

8.

Adjacent to What? As noted above, the Corps’ 1982 regulations asserted
jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to traditional navigable waters, adjacent to
interstate waters, adjacent to tributaries of traditional navigable waters or interstate
waters, and adjacent to isolated, intrastate waters the use or misuse of which could
affect interstate commerce. Which portions of the Corps’ regulations were
98

challenged in the Riverside Bayview case? Did the Court express any opinion
regarding the legality of regulating other wetlands?
9.

Post-Script: The wetlands at issue in the Riverside Bayview case were not
developed, but were later used as compensatory mitigation for another wetlands
development. See Royal C. Gardner, Lawyers, Swamps and Money 200 (Island
Press 2011).

C.

Isolated Wetlands and Waters

In 1986, the year after the Supreme Court’s decision in Riverside Bayview Homes, the
Corps again amended its regulatory definition of “waters of the United States.” The Corps
did not change the categories of waters that would be regulated as “waters of the United
States,” but renumbered the regulations, so that the definition of “waters of the United
States” now appears at 33 C.F.R. § 328.3. In both the 1982 and 1986 regulations, the
Corps defined “waters of the United States” to include certain isolated, intrastate waters
that were not traditional navigable waters but that could be regulated because of their ties
to interstate commerce. The 1986 regulation, which used essentially the same language as
the 1982 regulation, described the “isolated waters” that could be regulated as “waters of
the United States” in the following manner:

33 C.F.R. § 328.3(a)(3)
All other waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent
streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows,
playa lakes or natural ponds, the use degradation or destruction of which could affect
interstate or foreign commerce, including any such waters:
(i) Which are or could be used by interstate or foreign travelers for recreational or
other purposes;
(ii) From which fish or shellfish could be taken and sold in interstate or foreign
commerce; or
(iii) Which are used or could be used for industrial purpose by industries in interstate
commerce

99

Although the Corps did not make any significant changes to the categories of “waters of the
United States” regulated in the rule itself, the agency provided further guidance in the
preamble to the rule regarding the types of “isolated waters” that would be regulated under
the Clean Water Act. See 51 Fed. Reg. 41206, 41217 (Nov. 13, 1986). For instance, the
Corps indicated that certain isolated waters would generally not be regulated as “waters of
the United States,” although they could be regulated on a case-by-case basis. Those
included non-tidal irrigation ditches; artificial lakes or ponds that are used for watering,
irrigation, or settling basins; and various other
artificially created waters.
The Migratory Bird Test: More significantly,
though, the Corps clarified that isolated waters
would generally be regulated under 33 C.F.R. §
328.3(a)(3) if the waters:





a. * * * are or would be used as habitat by
birds protected by Migratory Bird Treaties;
b. * * * are or would be used as habitat by
other migratory birds which cross state lines;
c. * * * are or would be used as habitat for
Photo 23 Photo by S. Johnson
endangered species; or
d. used to irrigate crops sold in interstate commerce.” See 51 Fed. Reg. at 41217.

As noted above, this “migratory bird rule” was not adopted as a regulation but included in
the preamble to the regulation as guidance. In the years following the amendment of the
rules, federal appellate courts reached opposing conclusions regarding the validity of the
“migratory bird rule.” The Ninth Circuit upheld regulation of artificial wetlands in basins that
were formerly used in salt production on the grounds that the Corps had determined that
the wetlands provided habitat for migratory birds and the endangered salt marsh harvest
mouse. See Leslie Salt v. United States, 896 F.2d 354 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 486
U.S. 1126 (1991). The Seventh Circuit, reviewing EPA’s version of the test, initially
invalidated the test, see Hoffman Homes, Inc. v. Administrator, United States EPA, 961
F.2d 1310 (7th Cir. 1992), but later upheld it. See Hoffman Homes, Inc. v. Administrator,
United States EPA 975 F.2d 1554 (7th Cir. 1992). The Fourth Circuit expressed deeper
concerns and a divided panel of the Circuit suggested that the Corps exceeded its statutory
authority in regulating isolated waters generally simply because they could, rather than did,
affect interstate commerce. See United States v. Wilson, 133 F.3d 251 (4th Cir. 1997).
The dispute over the Corps’ authority to regulate isolated waters reached the U.S. Supreme
Court in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. United States Army Corps of
Engineers. Sixteen years after Riverside Bayview Homes, the Court was reviewing another
case focusing on the government’s Clean Water Act jurisdiction over “waters of the United
States.” Unlike the unanimous decision in Riverside Bayview Homes, the Solid Waste
100

Agency case generated greater division among the Court, which issued a 5-4 decision.
Justices Rehnquist, O’Connor, Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas were in the majority, with
Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer dissenting.

531 U.S. 159 (2001)
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered
the opinion of the Court.

Section 404(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA or Act), 86 Stat. 884, as amended, 33 U.S.C.
§ 1344(a), regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into “navigable waters.” The
United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), has interpreted § 404(a) to confer federal
authority over an abandoned sand and gravel pit in northern Illinois which provides habitat
for migratory birds. We are asked to decide whether the provisions of § 404(a) may be fairly
extended to these waters, and, if so, whether Congress could exercise such authority
consistent with the Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. We answer the first
question in the negative and therefore do not reach the second.
Petitioner, the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC), is a consortium of
23 suburban Chicago cities and villages that united in an effort to locate and develop a
disposal site for baled nonhazardous solid waste. The Chicago Gravel Company informed
the municipalities of the availability of a 533-acre parcel, bestriding the Illinois counties
Cook and Kane, which had been the site of a sand and gravel pit mining operation for three
decades up until about 1960. Long since abandoned, the old mining site eventually gave
way to a successional stage forest, with its remnant excavation trenches evolving into a
scattering of permanent and seasonal ponds of varying size (from under one-tenth of an
acre to several acres) and depth (from several inches to several feet). The municipalities
decided to purchase the site for disposal of their baled nonhazardous solid waste. By law,
SWANCC was required to file for various permits from Cook County and the State of Illinois
before it could begin operation of its balefill project. In addition, because the operation
called for the filling of some of the permanent and seasonal ponds, SWANCC contacted
federal respondents (hereinafter respondents), including the Corps, to determine if a
federal landfill permit was required under § 404(a) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a).
101

Section 404(a) grants the Corps authority to issue permits “for the discharge of dredged or
fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites.” Ibid. The term “navigable
waters” is defined under the Act as “the waters of the United States, including the territorial
seas.” § 1362(7). The Corps has issued regulations defining the term “waters of the United
States” to include “waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent
streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa
lakes, or natural ponds, the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate
or foreign commerce . . . .” 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(a)(3) (1999).
In 1986, in an attempt to “clarify” the reach of its jurisdiction, the Corps stated that § 404(a)
extends to intrastate waters:
“a.
“b.
“c.
“d.

Which are or would be used as habitat by birds protected by Migratory Bird Treaties;
or
Which are or would be used as habitat by other migratory birds which cross state
lines; or
Which are or would be used as habitat for endangered species; or
Used to irrigate crops sold in interstate commerce.”

51 Fed. Reg. 41217.
This last promulgation has been dubbed the “Migratory Bird Rule.”1 The Corps initially
concluded that it had no jurisdiction over the site because it contained no “wetlands,” or
areas which support “vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions,” 33
C.F.R. § 328.3(b) (1999). However, after the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission
informed the Corps that a number of migratory bird species had been observed at the site,
the Corps reconsidered and ultimately asserted jurisdiction over the balefill site pursuant to
subpart (b) of the “Migratory Bird Rule.” The Corps found that approximately 121 bird
species had been observed at the site, including several known to depend upon aquatic
environments for a significant portion of their life requirements. Thus, on November 16,
1987, the Corps formally “determined that the seasonally ponded, abandoned gravel
mining depressions located on the project site, while not wetlands, did qualify as ‘waters of
the United States’ . . . based upon the following criteria: (1) the proposed site had been
abandoned as a gravel mining operation; (2) the water areas and spoil piles had developed
a natural character; and (3) the water areas are used as habitat by migratory bird [sic]
which cross state lines.” * * * During the application process, SWANCC made several
proposals to mitigate the likely displacement of the migratory birds and to preserve a great
blue heron rookery located on the site. Its balefill project ultimately received the necessary
local and state approval. By 1993, SWANCC had received a special use planned

procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553.
102

development permit from the Cook County Board of Appeals, a landfill development permit
from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and approval from the Illinois
Department of Conservation.
Despite SWANCC’s securing the required water quality certification from the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency, the Corps refused to issue a §404(a) permit. * * *
Petitioner filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.§ 701 et seq., in the
Northern District of Illinois challenging both the Corps’ jurisdiction over the site and the
merits of its denial of the §404(a) permit. The District Court granted summary judgment to
respondents on the jurisdictional issue, and petitioner abandoned its challenge to the
Corps’ permit decision. On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, petitioner
renewed its attack on respondents’ use of the “Migratory Bird Rule” to assert jurisdiction
over the site. Petitioner argued that respondents had exceeded their statutory authority in
interpreting the CWA to cover nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters based upon the
presence of migratory birds and, in the alternative, that Congress lacked the power under
the Commerce Clause to grant such regulatory jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals began its
analysis with the constitutional question, holding that Congress has the authority to regulate
such waters based upon “the cumulative impact doctrine, under which a single activity that
itself has no discernible effect on interstate commerce may still be regulated if the
aggregate effect of that class of activity has a substantial impact on interstate commerce.”
* * * The aggregate effect of the “destruction of the natural habitat of migratory birds” on
interstate commerce, the court held, was substantial because each year millions of
Americans cross state lines and spend over a billion dollars to hunt and observe migratory
birds.2 * * * The Court of Appeals then turned to the regulatory question. The court held
that the CWA reaches as many waters as the Commerce Clause allows and, given its
earlier Commerce Clause ruling, it therefore followed that respondents’ “Migratory Bird
Rule” was a reasonable interpretation of the Act. * * * We granted certiorari, * * * and now
reverse.
Congress passed the CWA for the stated purpose of “restor[ing] and maintain[ing] the
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.” 33 U.S.C.§1251(a). In so
doing, Congress chose to “recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and
rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, to plan the development and
use (including restoration, preservation, and enhancement) of land and water resources,
and to consult with the Administrator in the exercise of his authority under this chapter.” §
2

Relying upon its earlier decision in Hoffman Homes, Inc. v. EPA, 999 F.2d 256 (CA7
1993), and a report from the United States Census Bureau, the Court of Appeals found that
in 1996 approximately 3.1 million Americans spent $1.3 billion to hunt migratory birds (with
11 percent crossing state lines to do so) as another 17.7 million Americans observed
migratory birds (with 9.5 million traveling for the purpose of observing shorebirds). See 191
F.3d, at 850.
103

1251(b). Relevant here, § 404(a) authorizes respondents to regulate the discharge of fill
material into “navigable waters,” 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a), which the statute defines as “the
waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,”§ 1362(7). Respondents have
interpreted these words to cover the abandoned gravel pit at issue here because it is used
as habitat for migratory birds. We conclude that the “Migratory Bird Rule” is not fairly
supported by the CWA.
This is not the first time we have been called upon to evaluate the meaning of § 404(a). In
United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121 (1985), we held that the
Corps had § 404(a) jurisdiction over wetlands that actually abutted on a navigable
waterway. In so doing, we noted that the term “navigable” is of “limited import” and that
Congress evidenced its intent to “regulate at least some waters that would not be deemed
‘navigable’ under the classical understanding of that term.” Id., at 133. But our holding was
based in large measure upon Congress’ unequivocal acquiescence to, and approval of, the
Corps’ regulations interpreting the CWA to cover wetlands adjacent to navigable waters.
See id., at 135–139. We found that Congress’ concern for the protection of water quality
and aquatic ecosystems indicated its intent to regulate wetlands “inseparably bound up with
the ‘waters’ of the United States.” Id., at 134.
It was the significant nexus between the wetlands and “navigable waters” that informed our
reading of the CWA in Riverside Bayview Homes. Indeed, we did not “express any opinion”
on the “question of the authority of the Corps to regulate discharges of fill material into
wetlands that are not adjacent to bodies of open water . . . .” Id., at 131–132, n.8. In order
to rule for respondents here, we would have to hold that the jurisdiction of the Corps
extends to ponds that are not adjacent to open water. But we conclude that the text of the
statute will not allow this.
Indeed, the Corps’ original interpretation of the CWA, promulgated two years after its
enactment, is inconsistent with that which it espouses here. Its 1974 regulations defined §
404(a)’s “navigable waters” to mean “those waters of the United States which are subject to
the ebb and flow of the tide, and/or are presently, or have been in the past, or may be in the
future susceptible for use for purposes of interstate or foreign commerce.” 33 C.F.R. §
209.120(d)(1). The Corps emphasized that “[i]t is the water body’s capability of use by the
public for purposes of transportation or commerce which is the determinative factor.” §
209.260(e)(1). Respondents put forward no persuasive evidence that the Corps mistook
Congress’ intent in 1974.3
3

Respondents refer us to portions of the legislative history that they believe indicate
Congress’ intent to expand the definition of “navigable waters.” Although the Conference
Report includes the statement that the conferees “intend that the term ‘navigable waters’ be
given the broadest possible constitutional interpretation,” S. Conf. Rep. No. 92–1236, p.
144 (1972), neither this, nor anything else in the legislative history to which respondents
point, signifies that Congress intended to exert anything more than its commerce power
104

Respondents next contend that whatever its original aim in 1972, Congress charted a new
course five years later when it approved the more expansive definition of “navigable
waters” found in the Corps’ 1977 regulations. In July 1977, the Corps formally adopted 33
C.F.R. § 323.2(a)(5) (1978), which defined “waters of the United States” to include “isolated
wetlands and lakes, intermittent streams, prairie potholes, and other waters that are not
part of a tributary system to interstate waters or to navigable waters of the United States,
the degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate commerce.”
Respondents argue that Congress was aware of this more expansive interpretation during
its 1977 amendments to the CWA. Specifically, respondents point to a failed House bill, H.
R. 3199, that would have defined “navigable waters” as “all waters which are presently
used, or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a
means to transport interstate or foreign commerce.” 123 Cong. Rec. 10420, 10434 (1977).4
They also point to the passage in § 404(g)(1) that authorizes a State to apply to the
Environmental Protection Agency for permission “to administer its own individual and
general permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable
waters (other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their
natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or
foreign commerce . . . including wetlands adjacent thereto) within its jurisdiction . . . .” 33
U.S.C. § 1344(g)(1). The failure to pass legislation that would have overturned the Corps’
1977 regulations and the extension of jurisdiction in § 404(g) to waters “other than”
traditional “navigable waters,” respondents submit, indicate that Congress recognized and
accepted a broad definition of “navigable waters” that includes nonnavigable, isolated,
intrastate waters.
Although we have recognized congressional acquiescence to administrative interpretations
of a statute in some situations, we have done so with extreme care. * * * “[F]ailed
legislative proposals are ‘a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation
of a prior statute.’” Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A.,
511 U.S. 164, 187 (1994) (quoting Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496
U.S. 633, 650 (1990)). A bill can be proposed for any number of reasons, and it can be
rejected for just as many others. The relationship between the actions and inactions of the
95th Congress and the intent of the 92d Congress in passing §404(a) is also considerably
attenuated. Because “subsequent history is less illuminating than the contemporaneous
evidence,” Hagen v. Utah, 510 U.S. 399, 420 (1994), respondents face a difficult task in
over navigation. Indeed, respondents admit that the legislative history is somewhat
ambiguous. See Brief for Federal Respondents 24.

While this bill passed in the House, a similarly worded amendment to a bill originating in
the Senate, S. 1952, failed. See 123 Cong. Rec. 26710, 26728 (1977).
105

overcoming the plain text and import of § 404(a).
We conclude that respondents have failed to make the necessary showing that the failure
of the 1977 House bill demonstrates Congress’ acquiescence to the Corps’ regulations or
the “Migratory Bird Rule,” which, of course, did not first appear until 1986. Although
respondents cite some legislative history showing Congress’ recognition of the Corps’
assertion of jurisdiction over “isolated waters,”* * * as we explained in Riverside Bayview
Homes, “[i]n both Chambers, debate on the proposals to narrow the definition of navigable
waters centered largely on the issue of wetlands preservation.” 474 U.S., at 136. Beyond
Congress’ desire to regulate wetlands adjacent to “navigable waters,” respondents point us
to no persuasive evidence that the House bill was proposed in response to the Corps’ claim
of jurisdiction over nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters or that its failure indicated
congressional acquiescence to such jurisdiction.
Section 404(g) is equally unenlightening. In Riverside Bayview Homes we recognized that
Congress intended the phrase “navigable waters” to include “at least some waters that
would not be deemed ‘navigable’ under the classical understanding of that term.” Id., at
133. But § 404(g) gives no intimation of what those waters might be; it simply refers to them
as “other . . . waters.” Respondents conjecture that “other . . . waters” must incorporate the
Corps’ 1977 regulations, but it is also plausible, as petitioner contends, that Congress
simply wanted to include all waters adjacent to “navigable waters,” such as nonnavigable
tributaries and streams. The exact meaning of § 404(g) is not before us and we express no
opinion on it, but for present purposes it is sufficient to say, as we did in Riverside Bayview
Homes, that “§ 404(g)(1) does not conclusively determine the construction to be placed on
the use of the term ‘waters’ elsewhere in the Act (particularly in § 502(7), which contains
the relevant definition of ‘navigable waters’) . . . .” Id., at 138, n.11.* * *
We thus decline respondents’ invitation to take what they see as the next ineluctable step
after Riverside Bayview Homes: holding that isolated ponds, some only seasonal, wholly
located within two Illinois counties, fall under § 404(a)’s definition of “navigable waters”
because they serve as habitat for migratory birds. As counsel for respondents conceded at
oral argument, such a ruling would assume that “the use of the word navigable in the
statute . . . does not have any independent significance.” * * * We cannot agree that
Congress’ separate definitional use of the phrase “waters of the United States” constitutes
a basis for reading the term “navigable waters” out of the statute. We said in Riverside
Bayview Homes that the word “navigable” in the statute was of “limited effect” and went on
to hold that § 404(a) extended to nonnavigable wetlands adjacent to open waters. But it is
one thing to give a word limited effect and quite another to give it no effect whatever. The
term “navigable” has at least the import of showing us what Congress had in mind as its
authority for enacting the CWA: its traditional jurisdiction over waters that were or had been
navigable in fact or which could reasonably be so made. See, e.g., United States v.
Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U.S. 377, 407–408 (1940).

106

Respondents— relying upon all of the arguments addressed above— contend that, at the
very least, it must be said that Congress did not address the precise question of § 404(a)’s
scope with regard to nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters, and that, therefore, we
should give deference to the “Migratory Bird Rule.” See, e.g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). We find § 404(a) to be
clear, but even were we to agree with respondents, we would not extend Chevron
deference here.
Where an administrative interpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of Congress’
power, we expect a clear indication that Congress intended that result. See Edward J.
DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575
(1988). This requirement stems from our prudential desire not to needlessly reach
constitutional issues and our assumption that Congress does not casually authorize
administrative agencies to interpret a statute to push the limit of congressional authority.
See ibid. This concern is heightened where the administrative interpretation alters the
federal state framework by permitting federal encroachment upon a traditional state power.
See United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971) (“[U]nless Congress conveys its
purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state
balance”). Thus, “where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise
serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems
unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.” DeBartolo, supra, at
575.
Twice in the past six years we have reaffirmed the proposition that the grant of authority to
Congress under the Commerce Clause, though broad, is not unlimited. See United States
v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000); United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995).
Respondents argue that the “Migratory Bird Rule” falls within Congress’ power to regulate
intrastate activities that “substantially affect” interstate commerce. They note that the
protection of migratory birds is a “national interest of very nearly the first magnitude,”
Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416, 435 (1920), and that, as the Court of Appeals found,
millions of people spend over a billion dollars annually on recreational pursuits relating to
migratory birds. These arguments raise significant constitutional questions. For example,
we would have to evaluate the precise object or activity that, in the aggregate, substantially
affects interstate commerce. This is not clear, for although the Corps has claimed
jurisdiction over petitioner’s land because it contains water areas used as habitat by
migratory birds, respondents now, post litem motam, focus upon the fact that the regulated
activity is petitioner’s municipal landfill, which is “plainly of a commercial nature.” * * * But
this is a far cry, indeed, from the “navigable waters” and “waters of the United States” to
which the statute by its terms extends.
These are significant constitutional questions raised by respondents’ application of their
regulations, and yet we find nothing approaching a clear statement from Congress that it
intended § 404(a) to reach an abandoned sand and gravel pit such as we have here.
107

Permitting respondents to claim federal jurisdiction over ponds and mudflats falling within
the “Migratory Bird Rule” would result in a significant impingement of the States’ traditional
and primary power over land and water use. See, e.g., Hess v. Port Authority TransHudson Corporation, 513 U.S. 30, 44 (1994) (“[R]egulation of land use [is] a function
traditionally performed by local governments”). Rather than expressing a desire to readjust
the federal-state balance in this manner, Congress chose to “recognize, preserve, and
protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States . . . to plan the development and
use . . . of land and water resources . . . .” 33 U.S.C. § 1251(b). We thus read the statute as
written to avoid the significant constitutional and federalism questions raised by
respondents’ interpretation, and therefore reject the request for administrative deference.8
We hold that 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(a)(3) (1999), as clarified and applied to petitioner’s balefill
site pursuant to the “Migratory Bird Rule,” 51 Fed. Reg. 41217 (1986), exceeds the
authority granted to respondents under §404(a) of the CWA. The judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is therefore
Reversed.
Questions and Comments
1.

Did the Solid Waste Agency case involve wetlands? If not, what implications does
the case have for regulation of wetlands?

2.

Artificial Wetlands: Note that the ponds in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook
County were artificially created. Even though the Court did not find jurisdiction over
the ponds in this case, man-made ponds and wetlands can be regulated as “waters
of the United States” under the Clean Water Act. See, e.g., Leslie Salt Co. v. United
States, 896 F.2d 354 (9th Cir. 1990); Texas Mun. Power Agency v. EPA, 836 F.2d
1482 (5th Cir. 1988).

3.

Could the “migratory bird rule” have been challenged on procedural grounds? With
what success?

4.

The “migratory bird rule” was not adopted as a rule through notice and comment
rulemaking. Is it appropriate, therefore, to use the Chevron analysis to review the
Corps’ decision? If Chevron doesn’t apply, should courts accord the agency any
deference? More or less than under the Chevron analysis? What weight should the
Corps’ 1974 rules carry, in light of the fact that the Corps rejected the reasoning

8

Because violations of the CWA carry criminal penalties, see 33 U. S.C. § 1319(c)(2),
petitioner invokes the rule of lenity as another basis for rejecting the Corps' interpretation of
the CWA. Brief for Petitioner 31–32. We need not address this alternative argument. See
United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 17 (1994).
108

behind them almost 25 years before the Solid Waste Agency decision?
5.

Does the Court use the Chevron analysis in this case? If so, does it decide the case
at step 1 or step 2? What canons of statutory analysis are central to the Court’s
holding?

6.

In Riverside Bayview Homes, the Court interpreted the Clean Water Act broadly in
accordance with its purposes and relied on evidence of Congressional
acquiescence in the Corps’ interpretation of the statute to uphold the Corps’
regulation of adjacent wetlands. Does the Court ignore those purposes and
evidence of Congressional acquiescence in this case? Does it focus on other
statutory goals? The dissenting Justices argued for a broad interpretation of the
statute consistent with the purposes articulated in Riverside Bayview Homes. They
noted, for instance, that the statute protects significant natural biological functions,
including food chain production, general habitat, and nesting spawning, rearing and
resting sites for aquatic wildlife and that isolated waters provide those functions,
regardless of whether they have any connection to traditional navigable waters. See
531 U.S. at 181-182 (Stevens, dissenting).

7.

Riverside Bayview Homes and the D.C. District Court’s Callaway decision seemed
to approve a broad reading of jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act to extend to all
waters that could be regulated under the Commerce Clause. Does the majority in
this case adopt a narrower vision of the breadth of authority? The dissenting
Justices argued that Congress’ Commerce Clause power over navigation is clearly
more limited than Congress’ Commerce Clause power generally. See 531 U.S. at
181 (Stevens, dissenting).
While the Court does not overrule Riverside Bayview Homes, the majority makes it
clear that the prior case did not address isolated waters and that the Court upheld
the regulation of adjacent wetlands in Riverside Bayview Homes because of the
“significant nexus” between the wetlands and more traditional “navigable waters.” Is
the Court saying that the Corps can only regulate traditional navigable waters or
waters that have some connection to traditional navigable waters? The dissenting
justices asserted that the Court’s decision could limit jurisdiction to actually
navigable waters, their tributaries, and wetlands adjacent to each. See 531 U.S. at
177 (Stevens, dissenting).

8.

How broad is the Court’s decision in the Solid Waste Agency case? Is the Court
simply striking down the migratory bird test, or is it invalidating the regulation of
isolated waters more generally? If the Corps can regulate isolated waters after the
Solid Waste Agency decision, which isolated waters can it regulate?

9.

Did the Court reach the question of whether the regulation of isolated waters based
109

on the migratory bird test violated the Commerce Clause? The dissent argued that
such regulation was clearly constitutional. The portion of the dissenting opinion
addressing that issue follows. Are you persuaded? For various views on the impact
of the Solid Waste Agency decision shortly after the Court issued the decision, see

IV
Because I am convinced that the Court's miserly construction of the statute is incorrect, I
shall comment briefly on petitioner's argument that Congress is without power to prohibit it
from filling any part of the 31 acres of ponds on its property in Cook County, Illinois. The
Corps' exercise of its § 404 permitting power over "isolated" waters that serve as habitat for
migratory birds falls well within the boundaries set by this Court's Commerce Clause
jurisprudence.
In United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 558-559 (1995), this Court identified "three broad
categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power": (1) channels
of interstate commerce; (2) instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons and things
in interstate commerce; and (3) activities that "substantially affect" interstate commerce.
Ibid. The migratory bird rule at issue here is properly analyzed under the third category. In
order to constitute a proper exercise of Congress' power over intrastate activities that
"substantially affect" interstate commerce, it is not necessary that each individual instance
of the activity substantially affect commerce; it is enough that, taken in the aggregate, the
class of activities in question has such an effect. Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146
(1971) (noting that it is the "class" of regulated activities, not the individual instance, that is
to be considered in the "affects" commerce analysis); see also Hodel, 452 U.S., at 277;
Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 127-128 (1942).

110

The activity being regulated in this case (and by the Corps' § 404 regulations in general) is
the discharge of fill material into water. The Corps did not assert jurisdiction over
petitioner's land simply because the waters were "used as habitat by migratory birds." It
asserted jurisdiction because petitioner planned to discharge fill into waters "used as
habitat by migratory birds." Had petitioner intended to engage in some other activity
besides discharging fill (i. e., had there been no activity to regulate), or, conversely, had the
waters not been habitat for migratory birds (i. e., had there been no basis for federal
jurisdiction), the Corps would never have become involved in petitioner's use of its land.
There can be no doubt that, unlike the class of activities Congress was attempting to
regulate in United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 613 (2000) ("[g]endermotivated
crimes"), and Lopez, 514 U.S., at 561 (possession of guns near school property), the
discharge of fill material into the Nation's waters is almost always undertaken for economic
reasons. See V. Albrecht & B. Goode, Wetland Regulation in the Real World, Exh. 3 (Feb.
1994) (demonstrating that the overwhelming majority of acreage for which § 404 permits
are sought is intended for commercial, industrial, or other economic use).15
Moreover, no one disputes that the discharge of fill into "isolated" waters that serve as
migratory bird habitat will, in the aggregate, adversely affect migratory bird populations.
See, e. g., 1 Secretary of the Interior, Report to Congress, The Impact of Federal Programs
on Wetlands: The Lower Mississippi Alluvial Plain and the Prairie Pothole Region 79-80
(Oct. 1988) (noting that "isolated," phase 3 waters "are among the most important and also
[the] most threatened ecosystems in the United States" because "[t]hey are prime nesting
grounds for many species of North American waterfowl ... " and provide "[u]p to 50 percent
of the [D. S.] production of migratory waterfowl"). Nor does petitioner dispute that the
particular waters it seeks to fill are home to many important species of migratory birds,
including the second-largest breeding colony of Great Blue Herons in northeastern Illinois,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, and several species of waterfowl protected by international treaty
and Illinois endangered species laws, Brief for Federal Respondents 7. 16
In addition to the intrinsic value of migratory birds, see Missouri v. Holland, 252 D. S. 416,
15

The fact that petitioner can conceive of some people who may discharge fill for
noneconomic reasons does not weaken the legitimacy of the Corps' jurisdictional claims.
As we observed in Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146 (1971), "[w]here the class of
activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no
power to excise, as trivial, individual instances of the class." Id., at 154 (internal quotation
marks omitted).
16

Other bird species using petitioner's site as habitat include the" 'Great Egret, Greenbacked Heron, Black-crowned Night Heron, Canada Goose, Wood Duck, Mallard, Greater
Yellowlegs, Belted Kingfisher, Northern Waterthrush, Louisiana Waterthrush, Swamp
Sparrow, and Red-winged Blackbird.' " Brief for Petitioner 4, n.3.
111

435 (1920) (noting the importance of migratory birds as "protectors of our forests and our
crops" and as "a food supply"), it is undisputed that literally millions of people regularly
participate in birdwatching and hunting and that those activities generate a host of
commercial activities of great value.17 The causal connection between the filling of wetlands
and the decline of commercial activities associated with migratory birds is not "attenuated,"
Morrison, 529 U.S., at 612; it is direct and concrete. Cf. Gibbs v. Babbitt, 214 F.3d 483,
492-493 (CA4 2000) ("The relationship between red wolf takings and interstate commerce
is quite direct-with no red wolves, there will be no red wolf related tourism ... ").
Finally, the migratory bird rule does not blur the "distinction between what is truly national
and what is truly local." Morrison, 529 U.S., at 617-618. Justice Holmes cogently observed
in Missouri v. Holland that the protection of migratory birds is a textbook example of a
national problem. 252 U.S., at 435 ("It is not sufficient to rely upon the States [to protect
migratory birds]. The reliance is vain ... "). The destruction of aquatic migratory bird habitat,
like so many other environmental problems, is an action in which the benefits (e. g., a new
landfill) are disproportionately local, while many of the costs (e. g., fewer migratory birds)
are widely dispersed and often borne by citizens living in other States. In such situations,
described by economists as involving "externalities," federal regulation is both appropriate
and necessary. * * * Identifying the Corps' jurisdiction by reference to waters that serve as
habitat for birds that migrate over state lines also satisfies this Court's expressed desire for
some "jurisdictional element" that limits federal activity to its proper scope. Morrison, 529
U.S., at 612.
The power to regulate commerce among the several States necessarily and properly
includes the power to preserve the natural resources that generate such commerce. Cf.
Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U.S. 941, 953 (1982) (holding water to be an
"article of commerce"). Migratory birds, and the waters on which they rely, are such
resources. Moreover, the protection of migratory birds is a well established federal
responsibility. As Justice Holmes noted in Missouri v. Holland, the federal interest in
protecting these birds is of "the first magnitude." 252 U.S., at 435. Because of their
transitory nature, they "can be protected only by national action." Ibid.
Whether it is necessary or appropriate to refuse to allow petitioner to fill those ponds is a
question on which we have no voice. Whether the Federal Government has the power to
require such permission, however, is a question that is easily answered. If, as it does, the
Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate particular "activities causing air or
17

In 1984, the U. S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment found that, in 1980, 5.3
million Americans hunted migratory birds, spending $638 million. * * * More than 100
million Americans spent almost $14.8 billion in 1980 to watch and photograph fish and
wildlife. Ibid. Of 17.7 million birdwatchers, 14.3 million took trips in order to observe, feed,
or photograph waterfowl, and 9.5 million took trips specifically to view other waterassociated birds, such as herons like those residing at petitioner's site. * * *
112

water pollution, or other environmental hazards that may have effects in more than one
State," Hodel, 452 U.S., at 282, it also empowers Congress to control individual actions
that, in the aggregate, would have the same effect. Perez, 402 U.S., at 154; Wickard, 317
U.S., at 127-128.18 There is no merit in petitioner's constitutional argument.
Because I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I respectfully dissent.

Repercussions of SWANCC - Isolated Waters, Non-Navigable Tributaries
and Their Adjacent Wetlands

While it was clear that the Supreme Court invalidated the Corps’ regulation of isolated
waters based on the “migratory bird rule,” it was unclear whether the Court was placing
further limits on the Clean Water Act jurisdiction over “waters of the United States.” As
noted above, the SWANCC court indicated that Court’s decision to uphold the regulation of
adjacent wetlands in Riverside Bayview was based on the “significant nexus” between
those wetlands and other waters and the SWANCC Court indicated that the term
“navigable” in the Clean Water Act “has at least the import of showing us what Congress
had in mind as its authority for enacting the CWA: its traditional jurisdiction over waters that
were or had been navigable in fact or which could reasonably be so made.” 531 U.S. at
172. Furthermore, in response to arguments that the legislative history of the Clean Water
Act demonstrated that Congress intended that “navigable waters” be given “the broadest
possible constitutional interpretation”, the SWANCC Court stressed that the legislative
history suggested that Congress only intended to exert its “commerce power over
navigation.” Id. at 168, n.3.
18

JUSTICE THOMAS is the only Member of the Court who has expressed disagreement
with the "aggregation principle." United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S.549, 600 (1995)
(concurring opinion).
113

Consequently, it was unclear, after SWANCC, whether the Corps and EPA could continue
to exercise jurisdiction over (1) isolated waters that have a sufficient connection to
interstate commerce, other than through the “migratory bird rule”; and (2) non-navigable
tributaries of traditionally navigable waters and wetlands adjacent to those non-navigable
tributaries.
Depending on how the decision was interpreted, the impact on regulated waters could have
been significant. A report prepared for the Association of State Wetlands Managers after
the SWANCC decision suggested that if the Court’s decision were interpreted to allow the
government to regulate only traditionally navigable waters and wetlands adjacent to those
waters, 80% of the nation’s wetlands would be excluded from federal regulation under the
Clean Water Act. See Jon Kusler, State Regulation of Wetlands to Fill the Gap 6
(Association of State Wetlands Managers, Inc., 2004). In that scenario, the major types of
wetlands that would be unregulated included prairie potholes, wet meadows, river fringing
wetlands along non-navigable rivers and streams, many forested wetlands, playas, and
vernal pools. Id. The report suggested that up to 95% of the waters in Arizona, 66% of
Florida’s wetlands and 90% of Wisconsin’s wetlands could be outside of federal regulation,
depending on the interpretation of the SWANCC decision. If, on the other hand, the
SWANCC decision were interpreted to allow the government to regulate traditionally
navigable waters, all of their tributaries, and wetlands adjacent to those waters and
tributaries, only 40% of the nation’s wetlands would be excluded from federal regulation. Id.
at 7.
Although States could, theoretically, have regulated the waters that would no longer be
subject to federal regulation after SWANCC, most States did not have such regulatory
programs in place. At the time of the SWANCC decision, thirty-two States did not have
programs to regulate isolated freshwater wetlands. Id. at 13. Prior to SWANCC, those
States primarily relied on the federal regulatory program and their ability to participate in the
permitting program through the Clean Water Act Section 401 certification process
(described in Chapter 6) to protect those waters. Id. A few States, including Indiana, Ohio,
North Carolina and South Carolina, expanded their State programs to regulate isolated
wetlands after SWANCC, but many did not. Id. at 13-14.
1.

Regulatory Response

Shortly after the Court’s decision in SWANCC, the General Counsel of EPA and the Chief
Counsel of the Corps issued a joint memorandum addressing the Court’s ruling. In the
guidance, the agencies adopted a narrow reading of the ruling. Although the agencies
acknowledged that the decision invalidated jurisdiction over isolated waters based on the
“migratory bird rule”, the guidance suggested that regulators could determine, on a caseby-case basis, that isolated waters could be regulated under the Clean Water Act if their
use, degradation, or destruction could affect interstate or foreign commerce and that non114

navigable isolated waters might be regulated if they had a “significant nexus” to other
waters of the United States. Id. § 5. It would be more difficult and time-consuming to
demonstrate the ties to interstate commerce on a case-by-case basis without relying on the
“migratory bird rule,” but the guidance suggested that such regulation was still appropriate
after the SWANCC ruling.
The guidance also addressed the agencies’ authority to regulate tributaries of navigable
waters and wetlands adjacent to those tributaries. Specifically, the guidance provided that
“the holding, the facts, and the reasoning of United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes
continue to provide authority for the EPA and the Corps to assert jurisdiction over ... all of
the traditional navigable waters, all interstate waters, all tributaries to navigable or interstate
waters, upstream to the highest reaches of the tributary systems, and over all wetlands
adjacent to any and all of those waters.” Id.
Two years later, after a change in presidential administrations, the agencies updated their
guidance. See 68 Fed. Reg. 1995 (Jan. 15, 2003). The 2003 guidance indicated that
“generally speaking” the Corps would continue to assert jurisdiction over all tributaries,
including non-navigable tributaries, of navigable waters, and to wetlands adjacent to those
tributaries. 68 Fed. Reg. at 1996. Regarding non-navigable isolated intrastate waters, the
guidance expressed skepticism that the agencies could assert jurisdiction over those
waters based on other ties to interstate commerce, but authorized regulators to continue to
do so on a case-by-case basis with approval from Headquarters. Id.
In January 2003, the Corps and EPA also began the process of developing a new rule to
clarify the definition of “waters of the United States” in light of the SWANCC decision by
issuing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking. See 68 Fed. Reg. 1991 (Jan. 15, 2003).
The agencies received more than 130,000 comments on the notice and the comments
overwhelmingly supported a narrow interpretation of SWANCC and broad federal
jurisdiction. See Jon Kusler, State Regulation of Wetlands to Fill the Gap 8 (Association of
State Wetlands Managers, Inc. 2004). Forty-three States submitted comments and forty of
those States encouraged the agencies to retain broad federal jurisdiction over “waters of
the United States.” Id. Many States were concerned that a broad reading of SWANCC
would make it difficult to protect wetlands in their States. Id. After more than 200 members
of Congress signed a letter, in November 2003, asking the Corps and EPA not to issue new
rules, EPA announced, in December 2003, that the agencies would not be moving forward
with new rules at that time. Id.
2.

Legislative Response

While the agencies were developing guidance to respond to SWANCC, Congress was also
focusing on the issue. In 2003, the Clean Water Authority Restoration Act was introduced in
the House and Senate. See S. 473, 108th Cong. 1st Sess. (2003); H.R. 962, 108th Cong., 1st
Sess. (2003). The legislation would restore an expansive definition of “waters of the United
115

States” to include “all waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, the territorial seas, and
all interstate and intrastate waters and their tributaries, including lakes, rivers, streams
(including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes,
wet meadows, playa lakes, natural ponds, and all impoundments of the foregoing, to the
fullest extent that these waters, or activities affecting these waters, are subject to the
legislative power of Congress under the Constitution.” S. 473, § 4(3). The legislation did not
pass, but was re-introduced in the 109th Congress, see Clean Water Authority Restoration
Act of 2005, S. 912, 109th Cong., 1st Sess. (2005); H.R. 1356, 109th Cong., 1st Sess. (2005)
and 110th Congress, see Clean Water Restoration Act of 2007 in the 110th Congress, see
H.R. 2421, 110th Cong., 1st Sess. (2007); S. 1870, 110th Cong., 1st Sess. (2007). Similar
legislation, with a slightly narrower definition of “waters of the United States” was proposed
in the 111th Congress, see Clean Water Restoration Act of 2009 - S. 787, 111th Cong. 1st.
Sess. (2009). Ultimately, however, none of those legislative proposals were successful.

While the Executive and Legislative branches considered or debated appropriate
responses to the SWANCC decision, landowners brought many judicial challenges to
federal jurisdiction over non-navigable tributaries and wetlands adjacent to those
tributaries. Most of the courts, including the federal appellate courts, that addressed the
question concluded that the Clean Water Act authorized regulation of those waters. See
Baccarat Fremont v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 425 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir. 2005); United
States v. Rueth Development Co., 335 F.3d 598 (7th Cir. 2003); United States v. Deaton,
332 F.3d 698 (4th Cir. 2003); Community Assn. For Restoration of Environment v. Henry
Bosma Dairy, 305 F.3d 943 (9th Cir. 2002); Headwaters, Inc. v. Talent Irrigation Dist., 243
F.3d 526 (9th Cir. 2001); but see In re Needham, 354 F.3d 340 (5th Cir. 2003). A 2004
Association of Wetlands Managers report noted that 28 of the 31 federal court decisions
interpreting SWANCC at that time had interpreted the Clean Water Act broadly, either by
interpreting “tributary” broadly to include non-navigable tributaries, by adopting a broad
concept of “adjacency” or by adopting a broad concept of the significant nexus. See Jon
Kusler, State Regulation of Wetlands to Fill the Gap 8 (Association of State Wetlands
Managers, Inc. 2004).
It was not long, however, before the Supreme Court again weighed in on the definition of
“waters of the United States.” Before reading the next case, it might be helpful to look a
little more closely at sections of the Corps and EPA regulations on “waters of the United
States” that have not been described in detail above.
First, in determining jurisdiction over tributaries, the regulations include navigable and nonnavigable tributaries, as long as the tributaries have a perceptible “ordinary high water
mark” See 33 C.F.R. § 328.4(c). An “ordinary high-water mark” is a “line on the shore
established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as
clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil,
116

destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate
means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.” 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(e).
Consequently, the federal regulations assert jurisdiction over a wide variety of intermittent
and ephemeral streams, ditches, and other non-navigable tributaries of navigable waters.
Second, the regulations define “adjacent” in a manner that is subject to generous
interpretation. Specifically, “adjacent” means “bordering, contiguous, or neighboring”
(emphasis added) and includes wetlands that are “separated from other waters of the
United States by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes and the
like.” See 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(c). Prior to the Rapanos case, some of the Corps’ offices had
concluded that wetlands were “adjacent” to other bodies of water if they were hydrologically
connected to the waters “through directional sheet flow during storm events” or if they were
within the 100 year floodplain of the waters. See General Accounting Office, Corps of
Engineers Needs to Evaluate its District Office Practices in Determining Jurisdiction GAO–
04–297, 16-18 (Feb. 2004).
The Supreme Court was faced with challenges to the government’s regulation of nonnavigable tributaries of navigable waters and to regulation of wetlands adjacent to those
tributaries in the following case, Rapanos v. United States. The case was actually the
consolidation of two separate Clean Water Act lawsuits: (1) an enforcement action against
John Rapanos for filling wetlands, to build a shopping center, without a Clean Water Act
permit; and (2) a challenge by Keith and June Carabell to the denial of a Clean Water Act
permit to fill wetlands for a housing development. In both cases, the federal government
asserted jurisdiction over the wetlands at issue not because the wetlands were adjacent to
traditional navigable waters but because they were adjacent to non-navigable tributaries of
navigable waters. In addition, in the Carabell case, the wetlands were separated from the
non-navigable tributaries by a berm. Ultimately, the Supreme Court split 4-4-1 in deciding
the case, so the decision has continued to muddy the waters on the scope of Clean Water
Act jurisdiction over “waters of the United States.”

In April 1989, petitioner John A. Rapanos
backfilled wetlands on a parcel of land in
Michigan that he owned and sought to
develop. This parcel included 54 acres of land with sometimes-saturated soil conditions.
The nearest body of navigable water was 11 to 20 miles away. 339 F.3d 447, 449 (CA6
2003) (Rapanos I). Regulators had informed Mr. Rapanos that his saturated fields were
“waters of the United States,” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(7), that could not be filled without a permit.
Twelve years of criminal and civil litigation ensued.
The burden of federal regulation on those who would deposit fill material in locations
denominated “waters of the United States” is not trivial. In deciding whether to grant or
deny a permit, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) exercises the discretion of an
enlightened despot, relying on such factors as “economics,” “aesthetics,” “recreation,” and
“in general, the needs and welfare of the people,” 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a) (2004). * * * The
average applicant for an individual permit spends 788 days and $271,596 in completing the
process, and the average applicant for a nationwide permit spends 313 days and
$28,915—not counting costs of mitigation or design changes. * * * “[O]ver $1.7 billion is
spent each year by the private and public sectors obtaining wetlands permits.” Id., at 81.
These costs cannot be avoided, because the Clean Water Act “impose[s] criminal liability,”
as well as steep civil fines, “on a broad range of ordinary industrial and commercial
activities.” Hanousek v. United States, 528 U.S. 1102, 1103 (2000) (Thomas, J., dissenting
from denial of certiorari). In this litigation, for example, for backfilling his own wet fields, Mr.
Rapanos faced 63 months in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in criminal and
civil fines. See United States v. Rapanos, 235 F.3d 256, 260 (CA6 2000).
The enforcement proceedings against Mr. Rapanos are a small part of the immense
expansion of federal regulation of land use that has occurred under the Clean Water Act—
without any change in the governing statute—during the past five Presidential
administrations. In the last three decades, the Corps and the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) have interpreted their jurisdiction over “the waters of the United States” to
cover 270-to-300 million acres of swampy lands in the United States—including half of
Alaska and an area the size of California in the lower 48 States. And that was just the
beginning. The Corps has also asserted jurisdiction over virtually any parcel of land
containing a channel or conduit—whether man-made or natural, broad or narrow,
permanent or ephemeral—through which rainwater or drainage may occasionally or
118

intermittently flow. On this view, the federally regulated “waters of the United States”
include storm drains, roadside ditches, ripples of sand in the desert that may contain water
once a year, and lands that are covered by floodwaters once every 100 years. Because
they include the land containing storm sewers and desert washes, the statutory “waters of
the United States” engulf entire cities and immense arid wastelands. In fact, the entire land
area of the United States lies in some drainage basin, and an endless network of visible
channels furrows the entire surface, containing water ephemerally wherever the rain falls.
Any plot of land containing such a channel may potentially be regulated as a “water of the
United States.”
***
II
In these consolidated cases, we consider whether four Michigan wetlands, which lie near
ditches or man-made drains that eventually empty into traditional navigable waters,
constitute “waters of the United States” within the meaning of the Act. Petitioners in No. 04–
1034, the Rapanos and their affiliated businesses, deposited fill material without a permit
into wetlands on three sites near Midland, Michigan: the “Salzburg site,” the “Hines Road
site,” and the “Pine River site.” The wetlands at the Salzburg site are connected to a manmade drain, which drains into Hoppler Creek, which flows into the Kawkawlin River, which
empties into Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron. * * * The wetlands at the Hines Road site are
connected to something called the “Rose Drain,” which has a surface connection to the
Tittabawassee River. * * * And the wetlands at the Pine River site have a surface
connection to the Pine River, which flows into Lake Huron. * * * It is not clear whether the
connections between these wetlands and the nearby drains and ditches are continuous or
intermittent, or whether the nearby drains and ditches contain continuous or merely
occasional flows of water.
The United States brought civil enforcement proceedings against the Rapanos petitioners.
The District Court found that the three described wetlands were “within federal jurisdiction”
because they were “adjacent to other waters of the United States,” and held petitioners
liable for violations of the CWA at those sites. * * * On appeal, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that there was federal jurisdiction over the
wetlands at all three sites because “there were hydrological connections between all three
sites and corresponding adjacent tributaries of navigable waters.” * * *

119

Petitioners in No. 04–1384, the Carabells, were denied a permit to deposit fill material in a
wetland located on a triangular parcel of land about one mile from Lake St. Clair. A manmade drainage ditch runs along one side of the wetland, separated from it by a 4-foot-wide
man-made berm. The berm is largely or entirely impermeable to water and blocks drainage
from the wetland, though it may permit occasional overflow to the ditch. The ditch empties
into another ditch or a drain, which connects to Auvase Creek, which empties into Lake St.
Clair. * * *
After exhausting administrative appeals, the Carabell petitioners filed suit in the District
Court, challenging the exercise of federal regulatory jurisdiction over their site. The District
Court ruled that there was federal jurisdiction because the wetland “is adjacent to
neighboring tributaries of navigable waters and has a significant nexus to ‘waters of the
United States.’ ” * * * Again the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Carabell wetland
was “adjacent” to navigable waters. 391 F.3d 704, 708 (2004) (Carabell).
We granted certiorari and consolidated the cases, * * * to decide whether these wetlands
constitute “waters of the United States” under the Act, and if so, whether the Act is
constitutional.
III
The Rapanos petitioners contend that the terms “navigable waters” and “waters of the
United States” in the Act must be limited to the traditional definition of The Daniel Ball,
which required that the “waters” be navigable in fact, or susceptible of being rendered so.
See 10 Wall., at 563. But this definition cannot be applied wholesale to the CWA. The Act
uses the phrase “navigable waters” as a defined term, and the definition is simply “the
waters of the United States.” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(7). Moreover, the Act provides, in certain
circumstances, for the substitution of state for federal jurisdiction over “navigable waters …
other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural
condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign
commerce … including wetlands adjacent thereto.” §1344(g)(1) (emphasis added). This
provision shows that the Act’s term “navigable waters” includes something more than
traditional navigable waters. We have twice stated that the meaning of “navigable waters”
in the Act is broader than the traditional understanding of that term, SWANCC, 531 U.S., at
167; Riverside Bayview, 474 U.S., at 133. * * * We have also emphasized, however, that
the qualifier “navigable” is not devoid of significance, SWANCC, supra, at 172.

120

We need not decide the precise extent to which the qualifiers “navigable” and “of the United
States” restrict the coverage of the Act. Whatever the scope of these qualifiers, the CWA
authorizes federal jurisdiction only over “waters.” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(7). The only natural
definition of the term “waters,” our prior and subsequent judicial constructions of it, clear
evidence from other provisions of the statute, and this Court’s canons of construction all
confirm that “the waters of the United States” in § 1362(7) cannot bear the expansive
meaning that the Corps would give it.
The Corps’ expansive approach might be arguable if the CWA defined “navigable waters”
as “water of the United States.” But “the waters of the United States” is something else. The
use of the definite article (“the”) and the plural number (“waters”) show plainly that §
1362(7) does not refer to water in general. In this form, “the waters” refers more narrowly to
water “[a]s found in streams and bodies forming geographical features such as oceans,
rivers, [and] lakes,” or “the flowing or moving masses, as of waves or floods, making up
such streams or bodies.” Webster’s New International Dictionary 2882 (2d ed. 1954)
(hereinafter Webster’s Second). * * * On this definition, “the waters of the United States”
include only relatively permanent, standing or flowing bodies of water.5 The definition refers
to water as found in “streams,” “oceans,” “rivers,” “lakes,” and “bodies” of water “forming
geographical features.” Ibid. All of these terms connote continuously present, fixed bodies
of water, as opposed to ordinarily dry channels through which water occasionally or
intermittently flows. Even the least substantial of the definition’s terms, namely “streams,”
connotes a continuous flow of water in a permanent channel—especially when used in
company with other terms such as “rivers,” “lakes,” and “oceans.” 6 None of these terms
5

By describing “waters” as “relatively permanent,” we do not necessarily exclude streams,
rivers, or lakes that might dry up in extraordinary circumstances, such as drought. We also
do not necessarily exclude seasonal rivers, which contain continuous flow during some
months of the year but no flow during dry months—such as the 290-day, continuously
flowing stream postulated by Justice Stevens’ dissent (hereinafter the dissent), post, at 15.
Common sense and common usage distinguish between a wash and seasonal river.
Though scientifically precise distinctions between “perennial” and “intermittent” flows are no
doubt available, * * * we have no occasion in this litigation to decide exactly when the
drying-up of a stream bed is continuous and frequent enough to disqualify the channel as a
“wate[r] of the United States.” It suffices for present purposes that channels containing
permanent flow are plainly within the definition, and that the dissent’s “intermittent” and
“ephemeral” streams, post, at 16 (opinion of Stevens, J.)—that is, streams whose flow is
“[c]oming and going at intervals … [b]roken, fitful,” Webster’s Second 1296, or “existing
only, or no longer than, a day; diurnal … short-lived,” id., at 857—are not.
6

The principal definition of “stream” likewise includes reference to such permanent,
geographically fixed bodies of water: “[a] current or course of water or other fluid, flowing on
the earth, as a river, brook, etc.” Id., at 2493 (emphasis added). The other definitions of
121

encompasses transitory puddles or ephemeral flows of water.
The restriction of “the waters of the United States” to exclude channels containing merely
intermittent or ephemeral flow also accords with the commonsense understanding of the
term. In applying the definition to “ephemeral streams,” “wet meadows,” storm sewers and
culverts, “directional sheet flow during storm events,” drain tiles, man-made drainage
ditches, and dry arroyos in the middle of the desert, the Corps has stretched the term
“waters of the United States” beyond parody. The plain language of the statute simply does
not authorize this “Land Is Waters” approach to federal jurisdiction.
In addition, the Act’s use of the traditional phrase “navigable waters” (the defined term)
further confirms that it confers jurisdiction only over relatively permanent bodies of water.
The Act adopted that traditional term from its predecessor statutes. See SWANCC, 531
U.S., at 180 (Stevens, J., dissenting). On the traditional understanding, “navigable waters”
included only discrete bodies of water. For example, in The Daniel Ball, we used the terms
“waters” and “rivers” interchangeably. 10 Wall., at 563. And in Appalachian Electric, we
consistently referred to the “navigable waters” as “waterways.” 311 U. S., at 407–409.
Plainly, because such “waters” had to be navigable in fact or susceptible of being rendered
so, the term did not include ephemeral flows. * * *
Moreover, only the foregoing definition of “waters” is consistent with the CWA’s stated
“policy of Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and
rights of the States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, [and] to plan the
development and use (including restoration, preservation, and enhancement) of land and
water resources … .” § 1251(b). This statement of policy was included in the Act as
enacted in 1972, see 86 Stat. 816, prior to the addition of the optional state administration
“stream” repeatedly emphasize the requirement of continuous flow: “[a] steady flow, as of
water, air, gas, or the like”; “[a]nything issuing or moving with continued succession of
parts”; “[a] continued current or course; current; drift.” Ibid. (emphases added). The
definition of the verb form of “stream” contains a similar emphasis on continuity: “[t]o issue
or flow in a stream; to issue freely or move in a continuous flow or course.” Ibid. (emphasis
added). On these definitions, therefore, the Corps’ phrases “intermittent streams,” 33
C.F.R. § 328.3(a)(3) (2004), and “ephemeral streams,” 65 Fed. Reg. 12823 (2000), are—
like Senator Bentsen’s “ ‘ flowing gullies,’ ” post, at 16, n.11 (opinion of Stevens, J.)—useful
oxymora. Properly speaking, such entities constitute extant “streams” only while they are
“continuous[ly] flow[ing]”; and the usually dry channels that contain them are never
“streams.” Justice Kennedy apparently concedes that “an intermittent flow can constitute a
stream” only “while it is flowing,” post, at 13 (emphasis added)—which would mean that the
channel is a “water” covered by the Act only during those times when water flow actually
occurs. But no one contends that federal jurisdiction appears and evaporates along with the
water in such regularly dry channels.
122

program in the 1977 amendments, see 91 Stat. 1601. Thus the policy plainly referred to
something beyond the subsequently added state administration program of 33 U.S.C. §
1344(g)–(l). But the expansive theory advanced by the Corps, rather than “preserv[ing] the
primary rights and responsibilities of the States,” would have brought virtually all “plan[ning
of] the development and use . . . of land and water resources” by the States under federal
control. It is therefore an unlikely reading of the phrase “the waters of the United States.”
***
Even if the phrase “the waters of the United States” were ambiguous as applied to
intermittent flows, our own canons of construction would establish that the Corps’
interpretation of the statute is impermissible. As we noted in SWANCC, the Government’s
expansive interpretation would “result in a significant impingement of the States’ traditional
and primary power over land and water use.” 531 U.S., at 174. Regulation of land use, as
through the issuance of the development permits sought by petitioners in both of these
cases, is a quintessential state and local power. See FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742,
768, n.30 (1982); Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U.S. 30, 44
(1994). The extensive federal jurisdiction urged by the Government would authorize the
Corps to function as a de facto regulator of immense stretches of intrastate land—an
authority the agency has shown its willingness to exercise with the scope of discretion that
would befit a local zoning board. See 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a)(1) (2004). We ordinarily expect
a “clear and manifest” statement from Congress to authorize an unprecedented intrusion
into traditional state authority. See BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation, 511 U.S. 531, 544
(1994). The phrase “the waters of the United States” hardly qualifies.
Likewise, just as we noted in SWANCC, the Corps’ interpretation stretches the outer limits
of Congress’s commerce power and raises difficult questions about the ultimate scope of
that power. See 531 U.S., at 173. (In developing the current regulations, the Corps
consciously sought to extend its authority to the farthest reaches of the commerce power.
See 42 Fed. Reg. 37127 (1977).) Even if the term “the waters of the United States” were
ambiguous as applied to channels that sometimes host ephemeral flows of water (which it
is not), we would expect a clearer statement from Congress to authorize an agency theory
of jurisdiction that presses the envelope of constitutional validity. See Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S.568, 575 (1988).
***
In sum, on its only plausible interpretation, the phrase “the waters of the United States”
includes only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water
“forming geographic features” that are described in ordinary parlance as “streams[,] …
oceans, rivers, [and] lakes.” See Webster’s Second 2882. The phrase does not include
channels through which water flows intermittently or ephemerally, or channels that
periodically provide drainage for rainfall. The Corps’ expansive interpretation of the “the
waters of the United States” is thus not “based on a permissible construction of the statute.”
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984).

IV
In Carabell, the Sixth Circuit held that the nearby ditch constituted a “tributary” and thus a
“water of the United States” under 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(a)(5) (2004). See 391 F.3d, at 708–
709. Likewise in Rapanos, the Sixth Circuit held that the nearby ditches were “tributaries”
under § 328(a)(5). 376 F.3d, at 643. But Rapanos II also stated that, even if the ditches
were not “waters of the United States,” the wetlands were “adjacent” to remote traditional
navigable waters in virtue of the wetlands’ “hydrological connection” to them. See id., at
639–640. This statement reflects the practice of the Corps’ district offices, which may
“assert jurisdiction over a wetland without regulating the ditch connecting it to a water of the
United States.” * * * We therefore address in this Part whether a wetland may be
considered “adjacent to” remote “waters of the United States,” because of a mere
hydrologic connection to them.
In Riverside Bayview, we noted the textual difficulty in including “wetlands” as a subset of
“waters”: “On a purely linguistic level, it may appear unreasonable to classify ‘lands,’ wet or
otherwise, as ‘waters.’ ” 474 U.S., at 132. We acknowledged, however, that there was an
inherent ambiguity in drawing the boundaries of any “waters”:
“[T]he Corps must necessarily choose some point at which water ends and land
begins. Our common experience tells us that this is often no easy task: the transition
from water to solid ground is not necessarily or even typically an abrupt one. Rather,
between open waters and dry land may lie shallows, marshes, mudflats, swamps,
bogs—in short, a huge array of areas that are not wholly aquatic but nevertheless
fall far short of being dry land. Where on this continuum to find the limit of ‘waters’ is
far from obvious.” Ibid.
Because of this inherent ambiguity, we deferred to the agency’s inclusion of wetlands
“actually abut[ting]” traditional navigable waters: “Faced with such a problem of defining the
bounds of its regulatory authority,” we held, the agency could reasonably conclude that a
wetland that “adjoin[ed]” waters of the United States is itself a part of those waters. Id., at
132, 135, and n.9. The difficulty of delineating the boundary between water and land was
central to our reasoning in the case: “In view of the breadth of federal regulatory authority
contemplated by the Act itself and the inherent difficulties of defining precise bounds to
regulable waters, the Corps’ ecological judgment about the relationship between waters
and their adjacent wetlands provides an adequate basis for a legal judgment that adjacent
wetlands may be defined as waters under the Act.” Id., at 134 (emphasis added).10
10

Since the wetlands at issue in Riverside Bayview actually abutted waters of the United
States, the case could not possibly have held that merely “neighboring” wetlands came
within the Corps’ jurisdiction. Obiter approval of that proposition might be inferred, however,
from the opinion’s quotation without comment of a statement by the Corps describing
124

When we characterized the holding of Riverside Bayview in SWANCC, we referred to the
close connection between waters and the wetlands that they gradually blend into: “It was
the significant nexus between the wetlands and ‘navigable waters’ that informed our
reading of the CWA in Riverside Bayview Homes.” 531 U.S., at 167 (emphasis added). In
particular, SWANCC rejected the notion that the ecological considerations upon which the
Corps relied in Riverside Bayview—and upon which the dissent repeatedly relies today,
see post, at 10–11, 12, 13–14, 15, 18–19, 21–22, 24–25—provided an independent basis
for including entities like “wetlands” (or “ephemeral streams”) within the phrase “the waters
of the United States.” SWANCC found such ecological considerations irrelevant to the
question whether physically isolated waters come within the Corps’ jurisdiction. It thus
confirmed that Riverside Bayview rested upon the inherent ambiguity in defining where
water ends and abutting (“adjacent”) wetlands begin, permitting the Corps’ reliance on
ecological considerations only to resolve that ambiguity in favor of treating all abutting
wetlands as waters. Isolated ponds were not “waters of the United States” in their own right,
see 531 U.S., at 167, 171, and presented no boundary-drawing problem that would have
justified the invocation of ecological factors to treat them as such.
Therefore, only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are
“waters of the United States” in their own right, so that there is no clear demarcation
between “waters” and wetlands, are “adjacent to” such waters and covered by the Act.
Wetlands with only an intermittent, physically remote hydrologic connection to “waters of
the United States” do not implicate the boundary-drawing problem of Riverside Bayview,
and thus lack the necessary connection to covered waters that we described as a
“significant nexus” in SWANCC. 531 U.S., at 167. Thus, establishing that wetlands such as
those at the Rapanos and Carabell sites are covered by the Act requires two findings: First,
that the adjacent channel contains a “wate[r] of the United States,” (i.e., a relatively
covered “adjacent” wetlands as those “ ‘that form the border of or are in reasonable
proximity to other waters of the United States.’ ” 474 U.S., at 134 (quoting 42 Fed. Reg.
37128 (1977); emphasis added). The opinion immediately reiterated, however, that
adjacent wetlands could be regarded as “the waters of the United States” in view of “the
inherent difficulties of defining precise bounds to regulable waters,” 474 U.S., at 134—a
rationale that would have no application to physically separated “neighboring” wetlands.
Given that the wetlands at issue in Riverside Bayview themselves “actually abut[ted] on a
navigable waterway,” id., at 135; given that our opinion recognized that unconnected
wetlands could not naturally be characterized as “ ‘waters’ ” at all, id., at 132; and given the
repeated reference to the difficulty of determining where waters end and wetlands begin;
the most natural reading of the opinion is that a wetlands’ mere “reasonable proximity” to
waters of the United States is not enough to confer Corps jurisdiction. In any event, as
discussed in our immediately following text, any possible ambiguity has been eliminated by
SWANCC, 531 U.S. 159 (2001).
125

permanent body of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters); and second,
that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water, making it difficult to
determine where the “water” ends and the “wetland” begins.
***
VIII
Because the Sixth Circuit applied the wrong standard to determine if these wetlands are
covered “waters of the United States,” and because of the paucity of the record in both of
these cases, the lower courts should determine, in the first instance, whether the ditches or
drains near each wetland are “waters” in the ordinary sense of containing a relatively
permanent flow; and (if they are) whether the wetlands in question are “adjacent” to these
“waters” in the sense of possessing a continuous surface connection that creates the
boundary-drawing problem we addressed in Riverside Bayview.
We vacate the judgments of the Sixth Circuit in both No. 04–1034 and No. 04–1384, and
remand both cases for further proceedings.
***
Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
These consolidated cases require the Court to decide whether the term “navigable waters”
in the Clean Water Act extends to wetlands that do not contain and are not adjacent to
waters that are navigable in fact. In Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army
Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159 (2001) (SWANCC), the Court held, under the
circumstances presented there, that to constitute “ ‘navigable waters’ ” under the Act, a
water or wetland must possess a “significant nexus” to waters that are or were navigable in
fact or that could reasonably be so made. Id., at 167, 172. In the instant cases neither the
plurality opinion nor the dissent by Justice Stevens chooses to apply this test; and though
the Court of Appeals recognized the test’s applicability, it did not consider all the factors
necessary to determine whether the lands in question had, or did not have, the requisite
nexus. In my view the cases ought to be remanded to the Court of Appeals for proper
consideration of the nexus requirement.
***
Riverside Bayview and SWANCC establish the framework for the inquiry in the cases now
before the Court: Do the Corps’ regulations, as applied to the wetlands in Carabell and the
three wetlands parcels in Rapanos, constitute a reasonable interpretation of “navigable
waters” as in Riverside Bayview or an invalid construction as in SWANCC? Taken together
these cases establish that in some instances, as exemplified by Riverside Bayview, the
126

connection between a nonnavigable water or wetland and a navigable water may be so
close, or potentially so close, that the Corps may deem the water or wetland a “navigable
water” under the Act. In other instances, as exemplified by SWANCC, there may be little or
no connection. Absent a significant nexus, jurisdiction under the Act is lacking. Because
neither the plurality nor the dissent addresses the nexus requirement, this separate opinion,
in my respectful view, is necessary.
A
The plurality’s opinion begins from a correct premise. As the plurality points out, and as
Riverside Bayview holds, in enacting the Clean Water Act Congress intended to regulate at
least some waters that are not navigable in the traditional sense. Ante, at 12; Riverside
Bayview, 474 U.S., at 133; see also SWANCC, supra, at 167. This conclusion is supported
by “the evident breadth of congressional concern for protection of water quality and aquatic
ecosystems.” Riverside Bayview, supra, at 133; see also Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S.
304, 318 (1981) (describing the Act as “an all-encompassing program of water pollution
regulation”). It is further compelled by statutory text, for the text is explicit in extending the
coverage of the Act to some nonnavigable waters.
***
From this reasonable beginning the plurality proceeds to impose two limitations on the Act;
but these limitations, it is here submitted, are without support in the language and purposes
of the Act or in our cases interpreting it. First, because the dictionary defines “waters” to
mean “water ‘[a]s found in streams and bodies forming geographical features such as
oceans, rivers, [and] lakes,’ or ‘the flowing or moving masses, as of waves or floods,
making up such streams or bodies,” ante, at 13 (quoting Webster’s New International
Dictionary 2882 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster’s Second)), the plurality would conclude
that the phrase “navigable waters” permits Corps and EPA jurisdiction only over “relatively
permanent, standing or flowing bodies of water,” ante, at 13–14—a category that in the
plurality’s view includes “seasonal” rivers, that is, rivers that carry water continuously except
during “dry months,” but not intermittent or ephemeral streams, ante, at 13–15, and n.5.
Second, the plurality asserts that wetlands fall within the Act only if they bear “a continuous
surface connection to bodies that are ‘waters of the United States’ in their own right”—
waters, that is, that satisfy the plurality’s requirement of permanent standing water or
continuous flow. Ante, at 23–24.
The plurality’s first requirement—permanent standing water or continuous flow, at least for
a period of “some months,” ante, at 13–14, and n.5—makes little practical sense in a
statute concerned with downstream water quality. The merest trickle, if continuous, would
count as a “water” subject to federal regulation, while torrents thundering at irregular
intervals through otherwise dry channels would not. Though the plurality seems to presume
that such irregular flows are too insignificant to be of concern in a statute focused on
127

“waters,” that may not always be true. Areas in the western parts of the Nation provide
some examples. The Los Angeles River, for instance, ordinarily carries only a trickle of
water and often looks more like a dry roadway than a river. * * * Yet it periodically releases
water-volumes so powerful and destructive that it has been encased in concrete and steel
over a length of some 50 miles. * * * Though this particular waterway might satisfy the
plurality’s test, it is illustrative of what often-dry watercourses can become when rain waters
flow. * * *
***
It follows that the Corps can reasonably interpret the Act to cover the paths of such
impermanent streams.
***
The plurality’s second limitation—exclusion of wetlands lacking a continuous surface
connection to other jurisdictional waters—is also unpersuasive. To begin with, the plurality
is wrong to suggest that wetlands are “indistinguishable” from waters to which they bear a
surface connection. Ante, at 37. Even if the precise boundary may be imprecise, a bog or
swamp is different from a river. The question is what circumstances permit a bog, swamp,
or other nonnavigable wetland to constitute a “navigable water” under the Act—as §
1344(g)(1), if nothing else, indicates is sometimes possible, see supra, at 10–11. Riverside
Bayview addressed that question and its answer is inconsistent with the plurality’s theory.
There, in upholding the Corps’ authority to regulate “wetlands adjacent to other bodies of
water over which the Corps has jurisdiction,” the Court deemed it irrelevant whether “the
moisture creating the wetlands … find[s] its source in the adjacent bodies of water.” 474
U.S., at 135. The Court further observed that adjacency could serve as a valid basis for
regulation even as to “wetlands that are not significantly intertwined with the ecosystem of
adjacent waterways.” Id., at 135, n.9. “If it is reasonable,” the Court explained, “for the
Corps to conclude that in the majority of cases, adjacent wetlands have significant effects
on water quality and the aquatic ecosystem, its definition can stand.” Ibid.
The Court in Riverside Bayview did note, it is true, the difficulty of defining where “water
ends and land begins,” id., at 132, and the Court cited that problem as one reason for
deferring to the Corps’ view that adjacent wetlands could constitute waters. Given,
however, the further recognition in Riverside Bayview that an overinclusive definition is
permissible even when it reaches wetlands holding moisture disconnected from adjacent
water-bodies, id., at 135, and n.9, Riverside Bayview’s observations about the difficulty of
defining the water’s edge cannot be taken to establish that when a clear boundary is
evident, wetlands beyond the boundary fall outside the Corps’ jurisdiction.
***

128

SWANCC, likewise, does not support the plurality’s surface-connection requirement.
SWANCC’s holding that “nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters,” 531 U.S., at 171, are
not “navigable waters” is not an explicit or implicit overruling of Riverside Bayview’s
approval of adjacency as a factor in determining the Corps’ jurisdiction. In rejecting the
Corps’ claimed authority over the isolated ponds in SWANCC, the Court distinguished
adjacent nonnavigable waters such as the wetlands addressed in Riverside Bayview. 531
U.S., at 167, 170–171.
As Riverside Bayview recognizes, the Corps’ adjacency standard is reasonable in some of
its applications. Indeed, the Corps’ view draws support from the structure of the Act, while
the plurality’s surface-water-connection requirement does not.
***
As the Court noted in Riverside Bayview, “the Corps has concluded that wetlands may
serve to filter and purify water draining into adjacent bodies of water, 33 C.F.R. §
320.4(b)(2)(vii) (1985), and to slow the flow of surface runoff into lakes, rivers, and streams
and thus prevent flooding and erosion, see §§ 320.4(b)(2)(iv) and (v).” 474 U.S., at 134.
Where wetlands perform these filtering and runoff-control functions, filling them may
increase downstream pollution, much as a discharge of toxic pollutants would. Not only will
dirty water no longer be stored and filtered but also the act of filling and draining itself may
cause the release of nutrients, toxins, and pathogens that were trapped, neutralized, and
perhaps amenable to filtering or detoxification in the wetlands. * * * In many cases,
moreover, filling in wetlands separated from another water by a berm can mean that flood
water, impurities, or runoff that would have been stored or contained in the wetlands will
instead flow out to major waterways. With these concerns in mind, the Corps’ definition of
adjacency is a reasonable one, for it may be the absence of an interchange of waters prior
to the dredge and fill activity that makes protection of the wetlands critical to the statutory
scheme.
***
It bears mention also that the plurality’s overall tone and approach—from the
characterization of acres of wetlands destruction as “backfilling … wet fields,” ante, at 2, to
the rejection of Corps authority over “man-made drainage ditches” and “dry arroyos” without
regard to how much water they periodically carry, ante, at 15, to the suggestion, seemingly
contrary to Congress’ judgment, that discharge of fill material is inconsequential for
adjacent waterways, ante, at 26, and n.11—seems unduly dismissive of the interests
asserted by the United States in these cases. Important public interests are served by the
Clean Water Act in general and by the protection of wetlands in particular. To give just one
example, amici here have noted that nutrient-rich runoff from the Mississippi River has
created a hypoxic, or oxygen-depleted, “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico that at times
approaches the size of Massachusetts and New Jersey. * * * Scientific evidence indicates
129

that wetlands play a critical role in controlling and filtering runoff. * * * It is true, as the
plurality indicates, that environmental concerns provide no reason to disregard limits in the
statutory text, ante, at 27, but in my view the plurality’s opinion is not a correct reading of
the text. The limits the plurality would impose, moreover, give insufficient deference to
Congress’ purposes in enacting the Clean Water Act and to the authority of the Executive
to implement that statutory mandate.
Finally, it should go without saying that because the plurality presents its interpretation of
the Act as the only permissible reading of the plain text, ante, at 20, 23–24, the Corps
would lack discretion, under the plurality’s theory, to adopt contrary regulations. The Chief
Justice suggests that if the Corps and EPA had issued new regulations after SWANCC they
would have “enjoyed plenty of room to operate in developing some notion of an outer
bound to the reach of their authority” and thus could have avoided litigation of the issues
we address today. Ante, at 2. That would not necessarily be true under the opinion The
Chief Justice has joined. New rulemaking could have averted the disagreement here only if
the Corps had anticipated the unprecedented reading of the Act that the plurality advances.
B
While the plurality reads nonexistent requirements into the Act, the dissent reads a central
requirement out—namely, the requirement that the word “navigable” in “navigable waters”
be given some importance. Although the Court has held that the statute’s language invokes
Congress’ traditional authority over waters navigable in fact or susceptible of being made
so, SWANCC, 531 U.S., at 172 (citing Appalachian Power, 311 U.S., at 407–408), the
dissent would permit federal regulation whenever wetlands lie alongside a ditch or drain,
however remote and insubstantial, that eventually may flow into traditional navigable
waters. The deference owed to the Corps’ interpretation of the statute does not extend so
far.
Congress’ choice of words creates difficulties, for the Act contemplates regulation of certain
“navigable waters” that are not in fact navigable. Supra, at 10–11. Nevertheless, the word
“navigable” in the Act must be given some effect. See SWANCC, supra, at 172. Thus, in
SWANCC the Court rejected the Corps’ assertion of jurisdiction over isolated ponds and
mudflats bearing no evident connection to navigable-in-fact waters. And in Riverside
Bayview, while the Court indicated that “the term ‘navigable’ as used in the Act is of limited
import,” 474 U.S., at 133, it relied, in upholding jurisdiction, on the Corps’ judgment that
“wetlands adjacent to lakes, rivers, streams, and other bodies of water may function as
integral parts of the aquatic environment even when the moisture creating the wetlands
does not find its source in the adjacent bodies of water,” id., at 135. The implication, of
course, was that wetlands’ status as “integral parts of the aquatic environment”—that is,
their significant nexus with navigable waters—was what established the Corps’ jurisdiction
over them as waters of the United States.

130

Consistent with SWANCC and Riverside Bayview and with the need to give the term
“navigable” some meaning, the Corps’ jurisdiction over wetlands depends upon the
existence of a significant nexus between the wetlands in question and navigable waters in
the traditional sense. The required nexus must be assessed in terms of the statute’s goals
and purposes. Congress enacted the law to “restore and maintain the chemical, physical,
and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters,” 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a), and it pursued that
objective by restricting dumping and filling in “navigable waters,” §§ 1311(a), 1362(12).
With respect to wetlands, the rationale for Clean Water Act regulation is, as the Corps has
recognized, that wetlands can perform critical functions related to the integrity of other
waters—functions such as pollutant trapping, flood control, and runoff storage. 33 C.F.R. §
320.4(b)(2). Accordingly, wetlands possess the requisite nexus, and thus come within the
statutory phrase “navigable waters,” if the wetlands, either alone or in combination with
similarly situated lands in the region, significantly affect the chemical, physical, and
biological integrity of other covered waters more readily understood as “navigable.” When,
in contrast, wetlands’ effects on water quality are speculative or insubstantial, they fall
outside the zone fairly encompassed by the statutory term “navigable waters.”
Although the dissent acknowledges that wetlands’ ecological functions vis-a-vis other
covered waters are the basis for the Corps’ regulation of them, post, at 10–11, it concludes
that the ambiguity in the phrase “navigable waters” allows the Corps to construe the statute
as reaching all “non-isolated wetlands,” just as it construed the Act to reach the wetlands
adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters in Riverside Bayview, see post, at 11. This, though,
seems incorrect. The Corps’ theory of jurisdiction in these consolidated cases—adjacency
to tributaries, however remote and insubstantial—raises concerns that go beyond the
holding of Riverside Bayview; and so the Corps’ assertion of jurisdiction cannot rest on that
case.
As applied to wetlands adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters, the Corps’ conclusive standard
for jurisdiction rests upon a reasonable inference of ecologic interconnection, and the
assertion of jurisdiction for those wetlands is sustainable under the Act by showing
adjacency alone. That is the holding of Riverside Bayview. Furthermore, although the
Riverside Bayview Court reserved the question of the Corps’ authority over “wetlands that
are not adjacent to bodies of open water,” 474 U.S., at 131–132, n.8, and in any event
addressed no factual situation other than wetlands adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters, it
may well be the case that Riverside Bayview’s reasoning—supporting jurisdiction without
any inquiry beyond adjacency—could apply equally to wetlands adjacent to certain major
tributaries. Through regulations or adjudication, the Corps may choose to identify
categories of tributaries that, due to their volume of flow (either annually or on average),
their proximity to navigable waters, or other relevant considerations, are significant enough
that wetlands adjacent to them are likely, in the majority of cases, to perform important
functions for an aquatic system incorporating navigable waters.
The Corps’ existing standard for tributaries, however, provides no such assurance. As
131

noted earlier, the Corps deems a water a tributary if it feeds into a traditional navigable
water (or a tributary thereof) and possesses an ordinary high-water mark, defined as a “line
on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by [certain] physical
characteristics,” § 328.3(e). See supra, at 3. This standard presumably provides a rough
measure of the volume and regularity of flow. Assuming it is subject to reasonably
consistent application, * * * it may well provide a reasonable measure of whether specific
minor tributaries bear a sufficient nexus with other regulated waters to constitute “navigable
waters” under the Act. Yet the breadth of this standard—which seems to leave wide room
for regulation of drains, ditches, and streams remote from any navigable-in-fact water and
carrying only minor water-volumes towards it—precludes its adoption as the determinative
measure of whether adjacent wetlands are likely to play an important role in the integrity of
an aquatic system comprising navigable waters as traditionally understood. Indeed, in
many cases wetlands adjacent to tributaries covered by this standard might appear little
more related to navigable-in-fact waters than were the isolated ponds held to fall beyond
the Act’s scope in SWANCC. * * *
When the Corps seeks to regulate wetlands adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters, it may rely
on adjacency to establish its jurisdiction. Absent more specific regulations, however, the
Corps must establish a significant nexus on a case-by-case basis when it seeks to regulate
wetlands based on adjacency to nonnavigable tributaries. Given the potential overbreadth
of the Corps’ regulations, this showing is necessary to avoid unreasonable applications of
the statute. Where an adequate nexus is established for a particular wetland, it may be
permissible, as a matter of administrative convenience or necessity, to presume covered
status for other comparable wetlands in the region. That issue, however, is neither raised
by these facts nor addressed by any agency regulation that accommodates the nexus
requirement outlined here.
This interpretation of the Act does not raise federalism or Commerce Clause concerns
sufficient to support a presumption against its adoption. To be sure, the significant nexus
requirement may not align perfectly with the traditional extent of federal authority. Yet in
most cases regulation of wetlands that are adjacent to tributaries and possess a significant
nexus with navigable waters will raise no serious constitutional or federalism difficulty. Cf.
Pierce County v. Guillen, 537 U.S. 129, 147 (2003) (upholding federal legislation “aimed at
improving safety in the channels of commerce”); Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Guy F.
Atkinson Co., 313 U.S. 508, 524–525 (1941) (“[J]ust as control over the non-navigable
parts of a river may be essential or desirable in the interests of the navigable portions, so
may the key to flood control on a navigable stream be found in whole or in part in flood
control on its tributaries … . [T]he exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate
interstate commerce may be aided by appropriate and needful control of activities and
agencies which, though intrastate, affect that commerce”). As explained earlier, moreover,
and as exemplified by SWANCC, the significant-nexus test itself prevents problematic
applications of the statute. See supra, at 19–20; 531 U.S., at 174. The possibility of
legitimate Commerce Clause and federalism concerns in some circumstances does not
132

require the adoption of an interpretation that departs in all cases from the Act’s text and
structure. See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, __ (2005) (slip op., at 14) (“[W]hen a general
regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of
individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence” (internal quotation
marks omitted)).
III
In both the consolidated cases before the Court the record contains evidence suggesting
the possible existence of a significant nexus according to the principles outlined above.
Thus the end result in these cases and many others to be considered by the Corps may be
the same as that suggested by the dissent, namely, that the Corps’ assertion of jurisdiction
is valid. Given, however, that neither the agency nor the reviewing courts properly
considered the issue, a remand is appropriate, in my view, for application of the controlling
legal standard.
***
In these consolidated cases I would vacate the judgments of the Court of Appeals and
remand for consideration whether the specific wetlands at issue possess a significant
nexus with navigable waters.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer
join, dissenting.
***
The narrow question presented in No. 04–1034 is whether wetlands adjacent to tributaries
of traditionally navigable waters are “waters of the United States” subject to the jurisdiction
of the Army Corps; the question in No. 04–1384 is whether a manmade berm separating a
wetland from the adjacent tributary makes a difference. The broader question is whether
regulations that have protected the quality of our waters for decades, that were implicitly
approved by Congress, and that have been repeatedly enforced in case after case, must
now be revised in light of the creative criticisms voiced by the plurality and Justice Kennedy
today. Rejecting more than 30 years of practice by the Army Corps, the plurality disregards
the nature of the congressional delegation to the agency and the technical and complex
character of the issues at stake. Justice Kennedy similarly fails to defer sufficiently to the
Corps, though his approach is far more faithful to our precedents and to principles of
statutory interpretation than is the plurality’s.
In my view, the proper analysis is straightforward. The Army Corps has determined that
wetlands adjacent to tributaries of traditionally navigable waters preserve the quality of our
Nation’s waters by, among other things, providing habitat for aquatic animals, keeping
133

excessive sediment and toxic pollutants out of adjacent waters, and reducing downstream
flooding by absorbing water at times of high flow. The Corps’ resulting decision to treat
these wetlands as encompassed within the term “waters of the United States” is a
quintessential example of the Executive’s reasonable interpretation of a statutory provision.
See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842–
845 (1984).
Our unanimous decision in United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121
(1985), was faithful to our duty to respect the work product of the Legislative and Executive
Branches of our Government. Today’s judicial amendment of the Clean Water Act is not.
***
Unlike SWANCC and like Riverside Bayview, the cases before us today concern wetlands
that are adjacent to “navigable bodies of water [or] their tributaries,” 474 U.S., at 123.
Specifically, these wetlands abut tributaries of traditionally navigable waters. As we
recognized in Riverside Bayview, the Corps has concluded that such wetlands play
important roles in maintaining the quality of their adjacent waters, see id., at 134–135, and
consequently in the waters downstream. Among other things, wetlands can offer “nesting,
spawning, rearing and resting sites for aquatic or land species”; “serve as valuable storage
areas for storm and flood waters”; and provide “significant water purification functions.” 33
C.F.R. § 320.4(b)(2) (2005); 474 U.S., at 134–135. These values are hardly “independent”
ecological considerations as the plurality would have it, ante, at 23—instead, they are
integral to the “chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters,” 33 U.S.C.
§ 1251(a). Given that wetlands serve these important water quality roles and given the
ambiguity inherent in the phrase “waters of the United States,” the Corps has reasonably
interpreted its jurisdiction to cover non-isolated wetlands. See 474 U.S., at 131–135.
This conclusion is further confirmed by Congress’ deliberate acquiescence in the Corps’
regulations in 1977. Id., at 136. Both Chambers conducted extensive debates about the
Corps’ regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands, rejected efforts to limit this jurisdiction, and
appropriated funds for a “ ‘National Wetlands Inventory’ ” to help the States “ ‘in the
development and operation of programs under this Act.’ ” Id., at 135–139 (quoting 33
U.S.C. § 1288(i)(2)). We found these facts significant in Riverside Bayview, see 474 U.S.,
at 135–139, as we acknowledged in SWANCC. See 531 U.S., at 170–171 (noting that
“[b]eyond Congress’ desire to regulate wetlands adjacent to ‘navigable waters,’
respondents point us to no persuasive evidence” of congressional acquiescence (emphasis
added)).
The Corps’ exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable even though not every wetland adjacent to
a traditionally navigable water or its tributary will perform all (or perhaps any) of the water
quality functions generally associated with wetlands. Riverside Bayview made clear that
jurisdiction does not depend on a wetland-by-wetland inquiry. 474 U.S., at 135, n.9.
134

Instead, it is enough that wetlands adjacent to tributaries generally have a significant nexus
to the watershed’s water quality. If a particular wetland is “not significantly intertwined with
the ecosystem of adjacent waterways,” then the Corps may allow its development “simply
by issuing a permit.” Ibid.6 Accordingly, for purposes of the Corps’ jurisdiction it is of no
significance that the wetlands in No. 04–1034 serve flood control and sediment sink
functions, but may not do much to trap other pollutants, supra, at 4–5, and n.2, or that the
wetland in No. 04–1328 keeps excess water from Lake St. Clair but may not trap sediment,
see supra, at 5–6.
***
In final analysis, however, concerns about the appropriateness of the Corps’ 30-year
implementation of the Clean Water Act should be addressed to Congress or the Corps
rather than to the Judiciary. Whether the benefits of particular conservation measures
outweigh their costs is a classic question of public policy that should not be answered by
appointed judges. The fact that large investments are required to finance large
developments merely means that those who are most adversely affected by the Corps’
permitting decisions are persons who have the ability to communicate effectively with their
representatives. Unless and until they succeed in convincing Congress (or the Corps) that
clean water is less important today than it was in the 1970’s, we continue to owe deference
to regulations satisfying the “evident breadth of congressional concern for protection of
water quality and aquatic ecosystems” that all of the Justices on the Court in 1985
recognized in Riverside Bayview, 474 U.S., at 133.
***
Justice Kennedy’s “significant nexus” test will probably not do much to diminish the number
of wetlands covered by the Act in the long run. Justice Kennedy himself recognizes that the
records in both cases contain evidence that “should permit the establishment of a
significant nexus,” ante, at 27, see also ante, at 26, and it seems likely that evidence would
support similar findings as to most (if not all) wetlands adjacent to tributaries of navigable
waters. But Justice Kennedy’s approach will have the effect of creating additional work for
all concerned parties. Developers wishing to fill wetlands adjacent to ephemeral or
intermittent tributaries of traditionally navigable waters will have no certain way of knowing
whether they need to get § 404 permits or not. And the Corps will have to make case-bycase (or category-by-category) jurisdictional determinations, which will inevitably increase
the time and resources spent processing permit applications. These problems are precisely
the ones that Riverside Bayview’s deferential approach avoided. See 474 U.S., at 135, n.9
(noting that it “is of little moment” if the Corps’ jurisdiction encompasses some wetlands “not
6

Indeed, “[t]he Corps approves virtually all section 404 permit[s],” though often requiring
applicants to avoid or mitigate impacts to wetlands and other waters. GAO Report 8.
135

significantly intertwined” with other waters of the United States). Unlike Justice Kennedy, I
see no reason to change Riverside Bayview’s approach—and every reason to continue to
defer to the Executive’s sensible, bright-line rule.
***
I would affirm the judgments in both cases, and respectfully dissent from the decision of five
Members of this Court to vacate and remand. * * * In these cases, * * * while both the
plurality and Justice Kennedy agree that there must be a remand for further proceedings,
their respective opinions define different tests to be applied on remand. Given that all four
Justices who have joined this opinion would uphold the Corps’ jurisdiction in both of these
cases—and in all other cases in which either the plurality’s or Justice Kennedy’s test is
satisfied—on remand each of the judgments should be reinstated if either of those tests is
met.14

Questions and Comments
1.

In light of the fact that there was no majority opinion in the Rapanos case, it is a little
difficult to determine precisely what further limits the Court placed on Clean Water
Act jurisdiction. Parsing the opinions closely may help clarify what the Court did and
did not hold. For instance, after SWANCC, some commentators believed that Clean
Water Act jurisdiction might be limited to traditional navigable waters and adjacent
wetlands. Did the plurality or any of the Justices adopt that narrow reading of the
statute? Is the SWANCC focus on limiting jurisdiction to Congress’ commerce power
over navigation retained by a majority of the Justices? Is Justice Breyer a voice
crying out in the wilderness?

2.

As noted above, the Rapanos Court focused on whether non-navigable tributaries of
traditional navigable waters were “waters of the United States” and on whether
wetlands adjacent to non-navigable tributaries were “waters of the United States.”
What test does the plurality adopt to answer those two questions? Note the
plurality’s distinction between ephemeral or intermittent streams, on the one hand,
and seasonal rivers or waters that dry up in extraordinary circumstances. Is the
plurality sliding down a slippery slope?

14

I assume that Justice Kennedy’s approach will be controlling in most cases because it
treats more of the Nation’s waters as within the Corps’ jurisdiction, but in the unlikely event
that the plurality’s test is met but Justice Kennedy’s is not, courts should also uphold the
Corps’ jurisdiction. In sum, in these and future cases the United States may elect to prove
jurisdiction under either test.
136

3.

Prior to Rapanos, the lower federal courts routinely deferred to the government’s
determinations that non-navigable tributaries of traditional navigable waters were
“waters of the United States.” Does the plurality ignore the Chevron analysis? In
construing the statute, does the plurality focus on the water quality purposes of the
statute or legislative history, as the Riverside Bayview Court had done? Why not?
On what purposes of the statute does the plurality focus? Which statutory
construction canons?

4.

What do you think of Justice Scalia’s tone in the plurality opinion? What did Justice
Kennedy think about it? It is interesting to compare the plurality’s factual description
of the plight of John Rapanos, who “faced 63 months in prison and hundreds of
thousands of dollars in criminal and civil fines” for “backfilling his own wet fields” with
the factual descriptions provided by Justice Kennedy and the dissenting Justices,
who point out that Rapanos threatened to “destroy” the consultant he hired to
delineate his property unless the consultant destroyed the report that identified the
wetlands on the property, and that Rapanos ignored numerous cease and desist
orders from the State and EPA when he filled the wetlands.

5.

Justice Kennedy wrote a separate opinion, concurring in the Court’s judgment.
Does Kennedy apply the Chevron analysis when determining whether the
government can regulate “ephemeral” or “intermittent” streams? Why does Justice
Kennedy feel such regulation is appropriate? Does he focus on the “significant
nexus” in his analysis of the non-navigable waters?

6.

What test does Justice Kennedy suggest should apply to determine whether
wetlands can be regulated? Does he adopt a different test depending on whether
the wetlands are adjacent to traditional navigable waters or whether they are
adjacent to non-navigable tributaries? Is his interpretation of the statute based on
the plain meaning of the text, the purposes of the statute, the legislative history, or
some combination of all three? Does Kennedy apply the Chevron analysis? How
does he respond to the plurality’s federalism and constitutional concerns?

7.

Applying the “Significant Nexus” Test: Does Kennedy believe that there must be
a hydrological connection between the wetlands and a traditional navigable in fact
water? Is a hydrological connection sufficient for Justice Kennedy? What types of
connections between wetlands and a traditional navigable water might constitute a
“significant nexus”? Would Kennedy focus only on the specific wetlands that the
government seeks to regulate in determining whether the wetlands have a
“significant nexus” to other waters? Do the plurality or dissenting Justices believe
that such ecological connections are sufficient to establish jurisdiction?

8.

Justice Stevens, in his dissenting opinion, argues for a straightforward application of
137

the Chevron analysis. Steven’s focus on the water quality protection purposes of the
Clean Water Act, Congressional acquiescence, and deference to agency expertise
echo the approach taken in the Court’s unanimous Riverside Bayview Homes
decision. Note how the dissenting Justices and Justice Kennedy, in his concurrence,
rely heavily on science and the scientific expertise of agencies in crafting their
opinions.
9.

A Missed Opportunity?: Justice Breyer, in a separate dissent, and Justice Roberts,
in a separate concurring opinion, both lament the government’s failure to adopt
regulations to clarify the meaning of “waters of the United States” after SWANCC
and both note that the government’s regulations would have been accorded
deference under Chevron if they had pursued that route. However, Justice Kennedy
suggests, in his concurrence, that if the plurality’s reasoning had been adopted by a
majority of the Court, the Corps and EPA would not be accorded Chevron deference
if, after the Rapanos decision, they adopted rules to clarify that ephemeral and
intermittent streams were “waters of the United States” and to adopt a definition of
“adjacent” similar to the approach that they were applying in practice before the
decision. Why would those rules not be accorded Chevron deference? See National
Cable & Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U.S.
967 (2005).

Rapanos Post-script: The United States finally settled the civil lawsuit against
Rapanos in December 2008, and the defendants agreed to pay $150,000 in civil
penalties, create 100 acres of wetlands, and preserve 134 acres of wetlands. The
consent decree is available at:

11.

Marks or Counting Noses?: The Justices divided 4-4-1 in Rapanos. Justice
Roberts, in a concurring opinion, suggests that lower courts and regulated parties
“will now have to feel their way on a case-by-case basis”. 547 U.S. at 758 (Roberts,
concurring). He provides some guidance on how the decision might be read by
citing Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003) (discussing Marks v. United States,
430 U.S. 188 (1977)). The dissenting Justices suggest an alternative approach for
reconciling the various opinions and developing a test for determining when it is
appropriate to regulate “non-navigable tributaries” and wetlands adjacent to nonnavigable tributaries? Compare the two approaches.

Post-Rapanos Developments

After the Rapanos decision, there was confusion regarding whether jurisdictional
determinations regarding non-navigable tributaries and wetlands adjacent to non-navigable
tributaries should be made based on the plurality’s test, Justice Kennedy’s test, or both. To
recap, the following chart highlights the differences between the plurality’s opinion and
Justice Kennedy’s opinion.
Non-Navigable Tributaries

Wetlands Adjacent to NonNavigable Tributaries

Plurality

Jurisdiction exists if the water is
a “relatively permanent,
continuously flowing” body of
water that flows into a traditional
navigable water.

Jurisdiction exists if the wetlands
have a “continuous surface
connection” with a relatively
permanent, continuously flowing
body of water that flows into a
traditional navigable water.

Kennedy

Jurisdiction exists if the water
has a significant nexus to a
traditional navigable water.

Jurisdiction exists if the wetlands
have a significant nexus to a
traditional navigable water.

A “significant nexus” exists
where the water “either alone or
in combination with similarly
situated lands in the region,
significantly affects the
chemical, physical, and
biological integrity” of a
traditional navigable water.

A “significant nexus” exists where a
wetland “either alone or in
combination with similarly situated
lands in the region, significantly
affects the chemical, physical, and
biological integrity” of a traditional
navigable water.

Justice Stevens, for the dissenting Justices, wrote that Justice Kennedy’s “significant
nexus” test would “probably not do much to diminish the number of wetlands covered by
the Act in the long run.” 547 U.S. at 808 (Stevens, dissenting) However, just as elimination
139

of the “migratory bird” test made it more time-consuming to document and support
jurisdictional determinations over “isolated waters,” the requirement that the Corps and EPA
demonstrate a “significant nexus” between wetlands or non-navigable tributaries and
traditional navigable waters would increase the time and resources necessary to document
and support jurisdictional determinations over those waters.
Justice Kennedy’s test would allow the Corps and EPA to regulate a much broader
universe of “waters” than the plurality’s test, but there are some “waters” that could be
regulated under the plurality’s test that would not be regulated under Kennedy’s test
(waters that have continuous surface connections to traditional navigable waters, but for
which the government cannot demonstrate a “significant nexus” to the traditional navigable
water).
Just as the SWANCC decision raised concerns that many isolated waters would be
excluded from federal regulation, the Rapanos decision raised concerns that many nonnavigable tributaries, including intermittent and ephemeral streams, and wetlands adjacent
to those non-navigable tributaries, would be excluded from federal regulation. The
Environmental Law Institute released a report that outlined, in great detail, the various
types of waters that would be unprotected at the State level if not protected at the federal
level. See Environmental Law Institute, America’s Vulnerable Waters: Assessing the
Nation’s Portfolio of Vulnerable Aquatic Resources since Rapanos v. United States, (Aug.
2011). In a follow-up report, the Institute warned that 36 states have laws that could restrict
the authority of state or local agencies to regulate, under their laws, waters that are
excluded from federal regulation. See Environmental Law Institute, State Constraints: State
Imposed Limitations on the Authority of Agencies to Regulate waters Beyond the scope of
the Federal Clean Water Act 1 (May 2013). The restrictions include “absolute or qualified
prohibitions that require state law to be ‘no more stringent than’ federal law; property rights
limitations; or a combination of the two.” Id. Once again, therefore, State environmental
regulators were concerned that the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Clean Water Act
could significantly harm their ability to protect waters and wetlands in their states.
1.

2008 Guidance

About a year after the Court’s ruling in Rapanos, the Corps and EPA issued guidance to
the Corps’ district offices and EPA regional offices regarding the implications of the ruling
for regulating “waters of the United States.” The agencies took public comment on the
guidance for seven and a half months and replaced the 2007 joint guidance document with
a revised guidance document in December 2008. In essence, the guidance asserted
jurisdiction over waters that would meet either the Kennedy or plurality tests. This is the
approach that was suggested by the dissenting Justices in Rapanos, as Justice Stevens
wrote, “Given that all four Justices who have joined this opinion would uphold the Corps’
jurisdiction in both of these cases—and in all other cases in which either the plurality’s or
Justice Kennedy’s test is satisfied—on remand each of the judgments should be reinstated
140

if either of those tests is met.” 547 U.S. at 810 (Stevens, dissenting). More specifically, the
guidance provided that the agencies would assert jurisdiction over:



Traditional navigable waters and wetlands adjacent to traditional navigable waters
Non-navigable tributaries of traditional navigable waters that are relatively
permanent where the tributaries typically flow year round or have continuous flow at
least seasonally (e.g. typically three months), and wetlands that direct abut such
tributaries

Those are the waters that would be regulated under Riverside-Bayview Homes or the
Rapanos plurality’s opinion.
In addition, the guidance provided that the agencies would decide jurisdiction over the
following waters based on a fact-specific analysis to determine whether they have a
significant nexus with a traditional navigable water:




Non-navigable tributaries that are not relatively permanent
Wetlands adjacent to non-navigable tributaries that are not relatively permanent
Wetlands adjacent to but that do not directly abut a relatively permanent nonnavigable tributary

Those are the waters that would be regulated under Justice Kennedy’s “significant nexus”
test from Rapanos.
The guidance also provided that the agencies would not exert jurisdiction over swales or
gullies with low volume or short or infrequent flows or ditches that are excavated wholly in
uplands and drain only in uplands. Many of the determinations that the agencies have
made using the guidance have been upheld in court, as the following section describes in
more detail.
2.

Judicial Interpretation of Rapanos

As Justice Roberts surmised, courts have been feeling their way on a case-by-case basis
to determine the reach of Rapanos. There has been a significant amount of litigation in the
federal courts focusing on the meaning of “waters of the United States” after Rapanos.
According to an Environmental Law Institute study, by May 2013, federal cases had been
brought in two thirds of all of the states in the United States after Rapanos and every
federal circuit court, other than the Second Circuit and Tenth Circuit, had issued an opinion
in a case involving Clean Water Act jurisdictional issues similar to those in Rapanos. See
Environmental Law Institute, State Constraints: State Imposed Limitations on the Authority
of Agencies to Regulate Waters Beyond the scope of the Federal Clean Water Act 4 (May
2013).

141

Three circuits have held that waters can be regulated if they meet either the “significant
nexus” test or the plurality test. Three circuits have upheld the “significant nexus” test
without ruling on whether the plurality test could be utilized in other cases. One circuit has
held that the “significant nexus” test is appropriate and the plurality test is not, and two
circuits have resolved their cases without deciding which test should be used to determine
jurisdiction.
The following chart outlines the split in jurisdictions:

Two trends are clear from those decisions. First, the appellate courts generally agree that if
a water satisfies Justice Kennedy’s “significant nexus” test, it can be regulated as a “water
of the United States.” Second, none of the appellate courts have found that the Rapanos
plurality test is a sufficient test, in and of itself, to determine jurisdiction.

3.

2011 Guidance and Proposed Rulemaking

While Courts have generally upheld the government’s exercise of jurisdiction under Justice
Kennedy’s “significant nexus” test, the test is time consuming and resource intensive, and
implementation of the test on a case-by-case basis led to reductions in the scope of waters
covered under the Clean Water Act. After the Rapanos decision, the Corps and EPA still
preferred to assert jurisdiction broadly over categories of waters rather than making the
jurisdictional determination on a case by case basis. Accordingly, the agencies continued
to explore amending their “waters of the United States” guidance or adopting regulations to
define the term more categorically.
In May 2011, the Corps and EPA prepared draft guidance to replace the 2008 guidance
and published the draft guidance in the Federal Register for public comment. See 76 Fed.
Reg. 24479 (May 2, 2011). The agencies received approximately 230,000 comments on
the guidance, but did not take further steps to finalize the guidance. See Environmental
Law Institute, The Clean Water Act Jurisdictional Handbook, 2d ed. 36 (May 2012).
Just as legislators proposed bills to respond to the Supreme Court’s SWANCC decision,
legislators introduced legislation to amend the Clean Water Act after the Rapanos decision.
In April 2010, Representative Oberstar introduced the America’s Commitment to the Clean
Water Act, which was similar to the previous Clean Water Restoration Acts, and would
establish broad jurisdiction over streams and wetlands. See H.R. 5088, 111th Cong. 2d
Sess. (2010). Other legislators introduced bills to restrict Clean Water Act jurisdiction or to
limit the Corps and EPA from finalizing the 2011 guidance or using it as the basis for a
rulemaking. See Defense of Environment and Property Act of 2012, S. 2122, 112th Cong.,
2d Sess. (2012), and Preserve the Waters of the United States Act, S. 2245, 112th Cong.,
2d Sess. (2012). Like the post-SWANCC legislation, though, none of the post-Rapanos bills
were enacted.
In September 2013, EPA released a draft study, Connectivity of Streams and Wetlands to
Downstream Waters, that concluded that all tributaries, including intermittent and
ephemeral streams, of downstream rivers are physically, chemically, and biologically
connected to the downstream rivers. Id. at 1-3. It also found that wetlands and open waters
in the flood plains of rivers and riparian areas are connected in the same way to
downstream rivers as the tributaries are connected to those rivers. Id. at 1-3. Although the
report did not find that isolated waters and wetlands that are outside of the floodplains of
rivers have a similar connection to downstream rivers, it did suggest that a case-by-case
analysis of such wetlands and waters could determine that they have an aggregate impact
on downstream rivers. Id. at 1-4. EPA’s Science Advisory Board then solicited public
comment on the proposal, and the agency indicated that the study would be the basis for a
proposed rulemaking to clarify the meaning of “waters of the United States.” See United
States Environmental Protection Agency, Clean Water Act Definition of “Waters of the
United States”, available at:
143

http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/wetlands/CWAwaters.cfm
Based on that study, which was ultimately finalized in January 2015, the Corps and EPA
issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to re-define “waters of the United States.” See 79
Fed. Reg. 22188 (Apr. 21, 2014). In the proposed rule, the agencies defined “waters of the
United States” to include traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, the territorial seas,
all impoundments of those three categories of waters, all tributaries of those three
categories of waters and all waters, including wetlands, adjacent to those three categories
of waters. Id. at 22262-22263. While the agencies were developing the rule, legislators
introduced bills to prevent the agencies from finalizing the rule. See Protecting Water and
Property Rights Act of 2014, S. 2496, 113th Cong., 2d Sess. (2014); Waters of the United
States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act, H.R. 594, 114th Cong., 2d Sess. (2014).
On June 29, 2015, EPA and the Corps issued a final rule after providing a 200 day
comment period and receiving more than 1 million comments on the proposal.” See 80
Fed. Reg. 37054, 37057 (June 29, 2015). According to the agencies, the rule “makes the
process of identifying waters protected under the [Clean Water Act] easier to understand,
more predictable, and consistent with the law and peer-reviewed science.” Id. at 37055.
The Connectivity Study ”provided much of the technical basis” for the rule. Id. at 37057.
Although the rule reduces the circumstances in which agencies must determine, on a caseby-case basis, that waters have a “significant nexus” to traditional navigable waters,
interstate waters or the territorial seas, the “significant nexus” standard remains an
important element of the agencies’ interpretation of the Clean Water Act. Id. at 37056. The
agencies identified several categories of waters as “waters of the United States” in the final
rule because the agencies concluded that the waters, as a class, had a “significant nexus”
to traditional navigable waters, interstate waters or the territorial seas. By reducing the
situations in which the Corps and EPA must conduct case-by-case analyses, the new rule
should make it easier for the agencies to determine that waters like those at issue in
Rapanos are protected by the Clean Water Act.
The final rule identifies eight categories of waters as “waters of the United States.” See 33
C.F.R. § 328.3(a). The first three categories of waters have long been regulated as “waters
of the United States,” and include traditional navigable waters, id. § 328.3(a)(1), interstate
waters (including interstate wetlands), id. § 328.3(a)(2), and the territorial seas. Id. §
328.3(a)(3). Any impoundments of those waters, id. § 328.3(a)(4), or tributaries of those
waters, id. § 328.3(a)(5) are also “waters of the United States.” The rule does not require
the Corps or EPA to make a case-by-case determination that an impoundment or tributary
of those waters is a “water of the United States.” It includes all such impoundments or
tributaries. The rule defines a tributary as “a water that contributes flow, either directly or
through another water ... to [a traditional navigable water, interstate water or the territorial
seas] that is characterized by the presence of the physical indicators of a bed and banks
and an ordinary high water mark.” Id. § 328.3(c)(3). Thus, the term is broad enough to
include ephemeral and intermittent streams.
144

In addition to those five categories of “waters,” the rule includes, as “waters of the United
States”, waters that are adjacent to waters within any of those five categories of waters. Id.
§ 328.3(a)(6). While the prior regulation defined “waters of the United States” to include
wetlands that were “adjacent” to other “waters of the United States,” and defined
“adjacent” to include “bordering, contiguous or neighboring,” the new rule includes
“adjacent” waters, as opposed simply to “adjacent” wetlands, and defines waters as
“neighboring” based on the distances between those waters and specific features of other
waters (i.e. ordinary high water mark, 100 year floodplain, high tide line). Id. § 328.3(c)(2).
While the prior regulation defined “waters of the United States” to include intrastate waters
the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce,
the new rule eliminates that category of “waters.” However, some waters that may have
been regulated under that “interstate commerce” category may still be regulated under the
new rule as the Corps and EPA include, in the “waters of the United States” definition, a
new category that includes prairie potholes, Carolina bays and Delmarva bays, pocosins,
Western vernal pools, and Texas coastal prairie wetlands, if those wetlands are
determined, on a case-by-case basis, to have a significant nexus to a traditional navigable
water, interstate water, or the territorial seas. Id. § 328.3(a)(7). While that decision must be
made on a case-by-case basis, the rule clarifies that the wetland types identified in the
category (prairie potholes, bays, pocosins, vernal pools, and coastal prairie wetlands) “are
similarly situated and shall be combined, for purposes of a significant nexus analysis, in the
watershed that drains to the nearest water...” Id.
Finally, the new rule includes, in the definition of “waters of the United States,” all waters
located within the 100 year floodplain of a traditional navigable water, interstate water, or
the territorial seas and all waters located within 4,000 feet of the high tide line or ordinary
high water mark of any of the first five categories of waters of the United States if the
waters are determined, on a case-by-case basis, to have a significant nexus to a traditional
navigable water, interstate water or the territorial seas. Id. § 328.3(a)(8).
For purposes of making the case-by-case determination required for the final two
categories of “waters of the United States,” the rule defines “significant nexus” to mean that
“a water, including wetlands, either alone or in combination with other similarly situated
waters in the region, significantly affects the chemical, physical or biological integrity” of the
other water. Id. § 328.3(c)(5). The rule also identifies aquatic functions that are relevant to
determine whether a water has a “significant nexus” to another water, including sediment
trapping; nutrient recycling; pollutant trapping, transformation, filtering and transport;
retention and attenuation of flood waters; runoff storage; contribution of flow; export of
organic matter; export of food resource; and provision of life cycle dependant aquatic
habitat. Id.
While the rule outlines eight categories of waters that are “waters of the United States,” it
145

also identifies several categories of waters that are not “waters of the United States,”
including waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, artificially irrigated areas that
would revert to dry land, other artificial and constructed waters and ornamental pools, as
well as depressions, various erosional features, puddles, groundwater, constructed
stormwater control features, waste water recycling structures, and many types of ditches.
Id. § 328.3(b). Most of those features were never regulated in the past, but the new rule
was the first rule to explicitly codify the exemptions.
The agencies predict that the new rule will reduce the scope of jurisdiction when compared
to jurisdiction prior to the SWANCC decision, but could increase jurisdiction by 2.84 - 4.65%
when compared to jurisdiction after the Rapanos decision. See U.S. EPA & U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Economic Analysis of the EPA-Army Clean Water Rule vii (May 2015).
They estimate that the annual costs for the regulation will range from $158.6 million to
$306.6 million, while the annual benefits will range from $338.9 million to $349.5 million. Id.
at x.
Within the first two days after the agencies published the final rule, 27 states filed lawsuits
challenging the rule. See Chris Marr, More Than Half States Sue EPA to Block Rule on
Water Jurisdiction, 46 Env. Reporter 2012 (July 3, 22015). Within another two weeks, 14
agriculture and industry groups filed lawsuits, see Amena H. Saiyid and Anthony Adragna,
Chamber of Commerce Joins in Water Rule Lawsuit, 46 Env. Reporter 2143 (July 17,
2015), and representative Adrian Smith (R-Neb.) introduced a resolution in Congress to
overturn the rule under the Congressional Review Act. See H.J. Res. 59, 114th Cong., 1st
Sess. (2015).
In October 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a
nationwide stay of the rule, pending review on the merits. See In re EPA and Department of
Defense Final Rule, (6th Cir., MDL No. 135, 10/9/15.

Hypotheticals
1. Will McDonald owns a farm near Washington, Iowa. And on that farm, he has several
prairie pothole wetlands. The nearest traditional navigable water, the Iowa River, is located
about 20 miles from McDonald's farm. The wetlands are not adjacent to any creeks,
streams or other watercourses. There is no evidence that the wetlands are connected by
surface water or groundwater to the Iowa River or any other traditional navigable water.
However, every spring, thousands of pintails, mallards, and Canada geese rely on the
wetlands (in conjunction with other wetlands in the region), for nesting and habitat on their
northerly migration. In addition, hundreds of birdwatchers from Illinois, Missouri and other
states flock to the Washington area every year to observe the annual migration. Would
McDonald need to obtain a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit or a Rivers and Harbors
Act Section 10 permit from the Corps of Engineers if he wanted to fill the wetlands? Would
your answer be different if it could be demonstrated that the wetlands on McDonald's
property, in conjunction with other wetlands in the region, played a vital role in preventing
flooding of the Iowa River?
2. Assume, instead, that the wetlands on McDonald's farm are not prairie pothole wetlands,
but are adjacent to an unnamed intermittent stream that flows for a mile into a ditch, which
is connected, after another mile, to the South Fork of Long Creek. The South Fork of Long
Creek flows into Long Creek, which is a tributary of the Iowa River (which is located 20
miles from McDonald's farm). The wetlands on McDonald's property do not have a
continuous surface connection to any traditional navigable water. There is also no evidence
of a groundwater connection between the wetlands and a traditional navigable water.
However, there is evidence that the wetlands, in conjunction with other wetlands in the
region, play a significant role in filtering pollution and sediments that would otherwise be
deposited in the Iowa River. Would McDonald need to obtain a Clean Water Act Section
404 permit or a Rivers and Harbors Act Section 10 permit to fill the wetlands on his
property? Would your answer be different if it could be demonstrated that the wetlands
provided important habitat for snakes that were listed on the state's list of endangered
species?
3. Assume, finally, that McDonald lives near Burlington, Iowa and owns property adjacent to
the Mississippi River. There are a few acres of wetlands on his property that are adjacent to
the Mississippi River. Would McDonald need to obtain a Clean Water Act Section 404
permit or a Rivers and Harbors Act Section 10 permit to fill the wetlands on his property?

Chapter 5
Additions and Discharges
I.

Regulated Activities

As noted in the previous Chapter, Section 301 of the Clean Water Act regulates the
“discharge” of pollutants, which the statute defines to mean “addition” of a pollutant to
navigable waters from a point source. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(12). Section 404 of the Act
authorizes the Corps of Engineers to issue permits for the “discharge of dredged or fill
material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites.” As a result, whether an
activity in wetlands or regulated waters is regulated under the Clean Water Act frequently
depends on whether it involves the addition of pollutants and on whether it involves the
discharge of dredged or fill material.
The terms “addition,” “dredged material,” “fill material,” and “discharge of dredged or fill
material” are not defined in the Clean Water Act, but the Corps and EPA have defined most
of them by regulation. The Corps first adopted regulations defining many of those terms in
1977. See 42 Fed. Reg. 37,121 (July 19, 1977). In those regulations, the agency defined
dredged material and fill material as follows:


Dredged material: material that is excavated or dredged from the waters
of the United States

Fill material: any material used for the primary purpose of replacing an
aquatic area with dry land or of changing the bottom elevation of a waterbody.
The term does not include any pollutant discharged into the water primarily to
dispose of waste, as that activity is regulated under Section 402 * * *

Id. While the definition of “dredged material” was simply tied to the nature of the material,
the definition of “fill material” was tied to the purpose for which the material was being
used. The regulations also included a definition of “discharge of dredged material”
(“addition of dredged material into the waters of the United States”) and a definition of
“discharge of fill material” (“addition of fill material into the waters of the United States”), but
150

neither was particularly illuminating. Id. The regulations did not define “addition.”
The regulations that EPA adopted in 1980 included a similar definition of “dredged
material,” but they defined “fill material” as: “any ‘pollutant’ which replaces portions of the
‘waters of the United States’ with dry land or which changes the bottom elevation of a water
body for any purpose.” See 45 Fed. Reg. 33290, 33421 (May 19, 1980). Thus, the EPA
definition of “fill material” was not tied to the purpose for which a material was used, but
rather the effect of the use of the material. For many years, the EPA and Corps regulatory
definitions of “fill material” diverged in that manner.
Since 2002, however, the Corps and EPA have defined the terms “dredged material” and
“fill material” consistently in their regulations. The current regulatory definitions of the terms
are:


Dredged material: material that is excavated or dredged from waters of
the United States.

Fill material: material placed in waters of the United States where the
material has the effect of: (i) Replacing any portion of a water of the United
States with dry land; or (ii) Changing the bottom elevation of any portion of a
water of the United States. * * *

33 C.F.R. § 323.2 (Corps’ regulations); 40 C.F.R. § 232.2 (EPA’s regulations). Both
agencies also include a non-exclusive list of materials that constitute “fill material” within
their definition of the term. The list includes “rock, sand, soil, clay, plastics, construction
debris, wood chips, overburden from mining or other excavation activities, and materials
used to create any structure or infrastructure in the waters of the United States.” Id.
The evolution of the definitions of “dredged material,” “fill material,” “discharge of dredged
material,” and “discharge of fill material” are discussed at length in the sections that follow.
However, neither agency has defined “addition” by regulation.

Hypothetical
Ellen Marshall is an attorney who specializes in real estate development and she represents
Stewart Griffith, a shopping mall developer. While meeting with Griffith last week to review a
contract to purchase property in Wilmington, Delaware, she learned that Griffith had instructed
some of the contractors who were building a mall for him on property near Dover, Delaware to
fill in an acre of coastal wetlands without seeking a permit from the Corps of Engineers. Griffith
told Marshall that the contractors had found several Black Rail nests in the wetlands. Since
Black Rails are an endangered bird, Griffith was sure that the Corps of Engineers would never
issue him a permit for the development if he applied for one, so he thought it would be best to
fill in the wetlands and hope no one found out about it. Marshall encouraged Griffith to tell the
Corps about his actions and to apply for an after the fact permit, but he refused and told her
that he would take his chances, because he didn’t think anyone other than the contractors
knew that the wetlands had been filled. Marshall believes that Griffith will be subject to much
more stringent penalties if the Corps discovers the violation independently than if Griffith
reports the violation to the Corps. Marshall is also concerned because there are only a few
Black Rails left in Delaware and Griffith’s action destroyed vital habitat for the birds. If Griffith
reports the violation and creates, restores or enhances wetlands in the vicinity of the mall
development in Dover, the birds have a better chance for survival. Can Marshall notify the
Corps about Griffith’s illegal filling activities if Griffin does not want to report the violation? See
American Bar Association, Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.6 (and associated
comments). Would your answer be different if the filling significantly increased the likelihood
that a hospice near the mall in Dover would be flooded in the event of a hurricane or major
tropical storm in the region?

A.

Landclearing

Because neither the statute nor agency regulations define “addition”, there has been
significant litigation regarding whether certain activities constitute the “addition” of a
pollutant. One question that has arisen frequently concerns whether there is an “addition” of
a pollutant when a material is removed from wetlands or other waters of the United States
and then replaced within the same waters. This issue arose shortly after the enactment of
the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act in the context of landclearing. If a person
cuts down trees or vegetation in a wetland or other water in order to clear the land, and
some of those trees or vegetation are disposed of in the wetlands or water, has there been
an “addition” of a pollutant, even though the trees and vegetation were in the wetland or
water at the outset of the landclearing activities? The following case explores that issue.

715 F.2d 897 (5th Cir. 1983)
RANDALL, Circuit Judge:

This is an appeal from a district court judgment
that enjoined the private defendants1 from any
additional clearing, except by permit under 33 U.S.C. § 1344 (Supp. V 1981), of certain
lands determined by the district court to be wetlands. The federal defendants2 contend that
the district court should have reviewed the Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") final
wetlands determination (attached as an appendix to this opinion) on the basis of the
administrative record, and that the court erred in adopting its own wetlands determination
instead of reviewing the agency's determination under the arbitrary and capricious
standard. The federal defendants also dispute the district court's conclusion that the mere
removal of vegetation from wetlands constitutes a discharge of a pollutant under section
301(a) of the Clean Water Act ("CWA"), 33 U.S.C. § 1311(a) (1976). * * * The private
defendants contest the validity of the district court's determination that approximately ninety
percent of their land is a wetland, as well as the court's conclusion that their landclearing
activities fall under the CWA's prohibition on the discharge of pollutants into waters of the
United States.
For the reasons set forth below, to the extent that the district court's decision that ninety
percent of the Lake Long Tract is a wetland is inconsistent with the EPA's determination,
the decision of the district court is reversed. The court's determination that the private
defendants' actual landclearing activities require permits is affirmed.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
This case concerns an approximately 20,000 acre tract of land (the "Lake Long Tract") in
Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana. The tract lies within the Bayou Natchitoches basin, an area of
approximately 140,000 acres, which, along with the Ouachita, Black and Tensas river
basins, makes up the Red River backwater area. The Bayou Natchitoches basin is subject
to flooding during the spring months, and it experiences an average rainfall of sixty inches
per year.

The private defendants are the owners of the land that is the subject of this litigation.
***

The federal defendants are United States Army Corps of Engineers and Environmental
Protection Agency officials. * * *
154

Much of the basin had been cleared of forest before the private defendants began their
landclearing activities, but 80,000 acres were still forested. The Lake Long Tract made up a
quarter of this forested area. The topography of the tract itself is uneven, resulting in some
areas with permanent water impoundments and other drier areas that support a variety of
plant species.
The private defendants own the Lake Long Tract. They decided that the land could be put
to agricultural use, specifically soybean production. Consequently, they began a program of
large-scale deforestation in June of 1978. * * * Using bulldozers with shearing blades that
"floated" along the ground, the defendants cut the timber and vegetation at or just above
ground level. The trees were then raked into windrows, burned, and the stumps and ashes
were disced into the ground by other machinery. The shearing and raking caused some
leveling of the tract, and the defendants dug one drainage ditch.
On August 25, 1978, the Vicksburg District of the Army Corps of Engineers ordered
defendant Prevot to halt his activities pending a wetlands determination by the Corps.
Thereafter, Dr. Donald G. Rhodes, an expert consultant employed by the Corps, undertook
a comprehensive vegetative mapping of the Lake Long Tract and determined that thirty-five
percent of it was a wetland. In October, 1978, the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote a letter to
the Corps stating that the Service believed that the entire tract was a wetland. After Dr.
Rhodes had made his determination, the landowners resumed their activities on the portion
of the tract that the Corps had not designated as a wetland.
On November 8, 1978, the plaintiffs5 brought this citizens' suit * * * against a number of
Corps and EPA officials, as well as against the private landowners. The plaintiffs claimed,
inter alia, that the landclearing activities would result in the discharge of dredged and fill
material into the waters of the United States in violation of sections 301(a) and 404 of the
CWA, * * * and also result in the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the United
States in violation of section 402 of the CWA, * * * The plaintiffs requested a declaration
that the tract was a wetland within the scope of the CWA, * * * that the private defendants
could not engage in their landclearing activities without obtaining a permit from the EPA or
the Corps, and that the federal defendants had failed to exercise their "mandatory duty"
* * * to designate the tract a wetland and to order the private defendants to cease and
desist from discharging pollutants and dredged materials. The plaintiffs also sought
injunctive relief against the federal defendants to require them to exercise their jurisdiction
over the property and to issue cease-and-desist orders until the private defendants
obtained the requisite permits. The district court immediately issued a temporary restraining
order, preventing the private defendants from engaging in landclearing activities pending

the court's action on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.
On January 17, 1979, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary
injunction and ordered the federal defendants to prepare a final wetlands determination
within sixty days. All of the private parties were to have the opportunity to participate in the
administrative proceedings, and the federal defendants were to file a preliminary report
within forty-five days. The court allowed the private defendants to engage in normal
cultivation on the more than 10,000 acres that had been cleared, but ordered them to apply
for a permit with respect to the area already designated by the government as a wetland
and enjoined them for sixty days from engaging [*903] in landclearing activities on the
remainder of the tract.
The parties complied with the court's preliminary order, and the EPA submitted its final
wetlands determination on March 26, 1979. * * * After examining the vegetation, soil
conditions, and hydrology of the tract, the EPA concluded that approximately eighty percent
of the land was a wetland. In a brief final paragraph, the EPA also offered its views of the
types of activities that would require a section 404 permit.
At the private defendants' request, the district court agreed to bifurcate the consideration of
the two major issues in the case: (1) how much of the Lake Long Tract was a wetland, and
(2) which activities required a section 404 permit. After extensive trials on both issues, the
court decided that a section 404 permit was required for the landclearing activities and that
over ninety percent of the Lake Long Tract was a wetland. * * * The court then enjoined
the private defendants from engaging in any additional landclearing activities, without a
section 404 permit, on the land that the court had determined to be a wetland, other than
the land already cleared. The defendants timely appealed.
***
[In Part II of the opinion, the court concluded that the district court used the wrong standard
to review EPA’s determination regarding the extent of wetlands on the private defendants’
property. The court held that the district court substituted its judgment for the agency and
reviewed the determination de novo, when the court should have accorded deference to
the agency’s determination and upheld it as long as it was not arbitrary or capricious.
However, instead of remanding the case to the district court to allow that court to review
EPA’s determination under the proper standard, the appellate court reviewed it and upheld
the agency’s finding that eighty percent of the private defendants property was wetlands on
the grounds that the agency’s determination was not arbitrary or capricious. The court also
rejected claims that the agency’s regulations asserting jurisdiction over wetlands exceeded
the agency’s authority under the Clean Water Act and that Congress unconstitutionally
delegated legislative power to the agency in the Act.]

III.

ACTIVITIES REQUIRING A PERMIT

[The court began Part III by indicating that the court would uphold the district court’s factual
findings unless they were clearly erroneous. After describing the evidence presented
below, the court concluded that it could not find on the basis of the record that the district
court’s factual findings were clearly erroneous. The major factual findings were
summarized at the beginning of this opinion. ] * * *
B.

The Discharge of Pollutants

The district court held that the private defendants' landclearing activities constituted a
"discharge of a pollutant" into the waters of the United States, and that engaging in those
activities without a section 404 dredge-and-fill permit was a violation of Section 301(a) of
the CWA. * * * As the district court did, we must look beyond section 301(a) itself, to the
statutory and regulatory definitions, in order to determine whether the district court's holding
was correct.
Section 502(12) defines the term "discharge of a pollutant" as "(a) any addition of any
pollutant to navigable waters from any point source ...." * * * The question in this case is
whether the landclearing activities were (1) a discharge (2) of a pollutant (3) from a point
source (4) into navigable waters. Further, we must determine whether the activities were
"normal agricultural activities" exempted from the permit requirements by 33 U.S.C. §
1344(f).
As discussed in Part II, these activities did occur in navigable waters, as that term is
defined in the statute. Further, we agree with the district court that the bulldozers and
backhoes were "point sources," since they collected into windrows and piles material that
may ultimately have found its way back into the waters. * * * The question then is whether
these activities constituted a "discharge" of a "pollutant."
Emphasizing that the removal of all of the vegetation would destroy the vital ecological
function of the wetlands, the district court concluded that the landclearing activities
constituted a "discharge" within the meaning of the CWA. Both the federal and private
defendants argue that the "mere removal" of wetlands vegetation was not a discharge
because the term discharge is defined as the "addition" of pollutants, not the removal of
materials. The district court rejected this argument as "untenable" because it believed that
the federal defendants' interpretation would frustrate the ecological purposes of the CWA.
* * * In the court's view, the federal defendants' argument implied that "the excavation of
[a] ditch 6 feet deep and 100 feet long requires a § 404 permit (is destructive of wetlands)
but that the clearing of 20,000 acres of forest wetlands by methods involving only de
minimis movement of earth does not (is not destructive of wetlands)." * * *
A brief analysis of the district court's factual findings indicates that the dispute about
157

whether the CWA covers the mere removal of vegetation is a false issue in this case. The
EPA has explained on appeal that it agrees with the district court that "if vegetation or other
materials are redeposited in the wetland, that activity is a discharge. [Their] point of
disagreement with the district court was with its apparent conclusion that removal activities
[were] covered by the Act even when nothing is redeposited on the land." Federal
Defendants' Reply Brief at 2 n.140 The district court's factual findings demonstrate that this
is not a "mere removal" case. The court found that "during the clearing process small
sloughs were filled in and larger ones partially filled thereby levelling the land." * * * The
landowners' own witness admitted to burying logs in holes that he had dug, and the
plaintiffs' witnesses testified that material that would not burn was buried. Since the
landclearing activities involved the redeposit of materials, rather than their mere removal,
we need not determine today whether mere removal may constitute a discharge under the
CWA.241 Any suggestion made by the district court that the term "discharge" does cover
removal is pure dicta.
The word "addition", as used in the definition of the term "discharge," may reasonably be
understood to include "redeposit." As the district court recognized, this reading of the
definition is consistent with both the purposes and legislative history of the statute. The
CWA was designed to "restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity
of the Nation's waters," 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a), and as discussed in Part II, the legislative
history indicates that Congress recognized the importance of protecting wetlands as a
means of reaching the statutory goals. * * * There is ample evidence in the record to
support the district court's conclusion that the landowners' redepositing activities would
significantly alter the character of the wetlands and limit the vital ecological functions
served by the tract. * * * Since we have concluded that the term "discharge" covers the
redepositing of materials taken from the wetlands, we hold that the district court correctly
decided that the landclearing activities on the Lake Long Tract constituted a discharge
within the meaning of the Act.43
40

After persistent questioning at oral argument, the federal defendants explained further
that, in their view, if the vegetation was cut down without significant disturbance of the soil
and then removed to dry land, no permit would be required. They further explained that, in
their view, if the vegetation were cut down and put back into the wetlands soil, however,
then there would have been a redeposit in the wetland, and hence a discharge.
41

It is equally clear from the record that the activities in this case did not involve a "de
minimis" disturbance; hence we have no reason to determine whether de minimis
disturbances are exempted from the Act. * * *
43

In National Wildlife, supra, the EPA argued that an activity was a discharge requiring a §
402 permit only if materials were introduced into the water "from the outside world." 693
F.2d at 165. No one has urged here that the materials must come from an external source
in order to constitute a discharge necessitating a § 404 permit, nor would we expect them
158

Similarly, we agree with the district court, the plaintiffs and the federal defendants that the
material discharged in this case was "fill," if not "dredged," material and hence subject to
the Corps' regulation under section 404, as long as the activities did not fall within the
section 404(f) exemption. The term "fill material" is defined in the Corps' regulations as:
any material used for the primary purpose of replacing an aquatic area with dry land
or of changing the bottom elevation of a waterbody. The term does not include any
pollutant discharged into the water primarily to dispose of waste, as that activity is
regulated under Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendments of 1972.
33 C.F.R. § 323.2(m). The regulations define the "discharge of fill material" as:
the addition of fill material into waters of the United States. The term generally
includes, without limitation, the following activities: Placement of fill that is necessary
to the construction of any structure in a water of the United States; the building of
any structure or impoundment requiring rock, sand, dirt, or other material for its
construction; site-development fills for recreational, industrial, commercial,
residential, and other uses; causeways or road fills; dams and dikes; artificial
islands; property protection and/or reclamation devices such as riprap, groins,
seawalls, breakwaters, and revetments; beach nourishment; levees; fill for
structures such as sewage treatment facilities, intake and outfall pipes associated
with power plants and subaqueous utility lines; and artificial reefs. The term does not
include plowing, cultivating, seeding and harvesting for the production of food, fiber,
and forest products.
33 C.F.R. § 323.2(n).
As discussed above, the burying of the unburned material, as well as the discing, had the
effect of filling in the sloughs on the tract and leveling the land. The landowners insist that
any leveling was "incidental" to their clearing activities and therefore the material was not
deposited for the "primary purpose" of changing the character of the land. The district court
found, however, that there had been significant leveling. The plaintiffs' witnesses testified
that sloughs that had contained rainwater in the past had been filled in; thus, the activities
were "changing the bottom elevation of the waterbody." Certainly, the activities were
designed to "replace the aquatic area with dry land." Accordingly, we hold that the district
to, since § 404 refers to "dredged" or "fill" material. As discussed infra, "dredged" material is
by definition material that comes from the water itself. A requirement that all pollutants must
come from outside sources would effectively remove the dredge-and-fill provision from the
statute. * * *
159

court correctly concluded that the landowners were discharging "fill material" into the
wetlands.
The district court also found that removal of the vegetation constituted dredging. The
regulations define "dredged material" as "material that is excavated or dredged from waters
of the United States." 33 C.F.R. § 323.2(k). The district court reasoned that since the
vegetation was part of the wetlands, it was also part of the "waters of the United States;"
therefore, removal of the vegetation constituted dredging.
The landowners emphasize that dredging is "excavation." They argue that the vegetation is
a wetland indicator, not a part of the wetland itself; therefore, the removal of the vegetation
from the surface of the wetland is not "dredging." The federal defendants agree with the
landowners that the removal of vegetation from above ground is not dredging, but they do
not view this as a crucial issue in this case because they agree with the district court that
the landowners were discharging "fill material." * * * We note that there was testimony that
the landowners' activities included the digging of ditches and holes, which would constitute
"dredging" even under the landowners' interpretation of the regulation. Like the federal
defendants, however, we do not believe that a decision whether there was a discharge of
dredged material is necessary here, since we have concluded that there was a discharge of
fill material.
***
[The court then determined that the defendants’ activities were not exempt from the permit
requirements of Section 404 as “normal farming operations.”]
***
V.

CONCLUSION
***

With respect to the activities at issue, we hold: * * *
(2) that in filling in the sloughs and leveling the land, the landowners were
redepositing fill material into waters of the United States, and that therefore, [*930]
these activities constituted a ‘discharge of a pollutant,’ * * *
Accordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment that these landclearing activities may not
be carried out without a section 404 dredge-and-fill permit; however, we note that should a
section 404 permit application be filed, the Corps will be free to apply its expertise to that
permit determination without any constraint from the district court's injunctive
determinations except those we have expressly affirmed.

Questions and Comments
1.

This was not a government enforcement action. Who sued? What was the
“mandatory duty” that the government failed to perform? Does the government have
a duty to bring enforcement actions whenever a person violates the Clean Water
Act? Government enforcement and citizen suits will be explored more fully in
Chapter 10.

2.

Does the court rely on the plain meaning of the term “addition” to conclude that the
redeposit of material in the wetlands constitutes an “addition?” On what tools of
statutory interpretation did the court rely to reach that determination?

3.

Although the court found that the trees and vegetation in this case met the
regulatory definition of “fill material,” the same appellate court concluded that trees
and vegetation that would be cut and left in wetlands to facilitate the construction of
a electricity transmission line were not “fill material” because the wetlands would
remain wetlands at the end of the project and would not be converted. See Save
Our Wetlands v. Sands, 711 F.2d 634 (5th Cir. 1983).

4.

At the time of this lawsuit, the Corps still defined “fill material” based on the purpose
for which the material was used. Was that important in this case? Would the court
have reached a different determination if the Corps defined “fill material”, as they do
today, to include material that has the effect of replacing any portion of a water of
the United States with dry land or changing the bottom elevation of any portion of a
water of the United States?

5.

The court does not determine whether the trees and vegetation constitute “dredged
material” because the court concludes that they are “fill material.” Note, though, that
the court suggests that the term “addition” must include some redeposit of materials
into waters, since the statute authorizes the Corps to issue permits for the discharge
of “dredged material,” which “is by definition material that comes from the water
itself.” See infra, n.43.

6.

If the landowner could have cleared the land without redepositing any of the trees or
vegetation in the wetlands, would that activity have been regulated as an “addition”
of a pollutant under the court’s opinion? What if the activity involved only the
redeposit of a small amount of vegetation or other material?

7.

Note the difference between the Corps’ delineation of the wetlands on the property
(35%), EPAs’ (80%), and the district court’s (90%). If all were relying on the same
delineation manual, why was there such a disparity in results?

The Rest of the Story: The controversy underlying the Avoyelles litigation is
161

recounted in detail in Oliver A. Houck, Rescuing Ophelia: Avoyelles Sportsmen's
League and the Bottomland Hardwoods Controversy, 81 Miss. L.J. 1473 (2012).
Post-script: In light of the court’s decision in Avoyelles, the Corps issued a Regulatory
Guidance Letter, RGL 85-04, that indicated that the Corps would apply the approach taken
by the Fifth Circuit on a national level and would require 404 permits for landclearing
activities with mechanized equipment if “the activity would involve burying logs or burying
burn residue, or totally or partially filling in sloughs or low areas, or leveling the land.” See
Regulatory Guidance Letter 85-04, Avoyelles ¶ 2 (March 29, 1985). The RGL also provided
that sidecasting of materials from the construction of ditches would require a permit. Id.
With regard to some of the questions that the Avoyelles court did not address, the Corps’
RGL provided that a 404 permit would not be required for the mere removal of vegetation
from wetlands or waters, id. ¶ 5, and that a 404 permit would not be required if the
landclearing only involved a de minimis discharge of dredged or fill material. Id. ¶ 4. The
RGL also clarified that a permit would not be required for the felling of a tree, piling of trees,
brush and stumps (which don’t totally or partially fill in sloughs or level the land), filling in
stump holes, or many types of discing, plowing or raking the soil surface in regulated
waters. Id. ¶ 6.
However, five years later, the Corps issued another Regulatory Guidance Letter, RGL 9005, in which the agency indicated that “it is our position that mechanized land-clearing
activities in jurisdictional wetlands result in a redisposition of soil that is subject to regulation
under section 404.” See Regulatory Guidance Letter 90-05, Landclearing Activities Subject
to Section 404 Jurisdiction, ¶ 2 (July 18, 1990). The guidance indicated that some limited
exceptions might occur, “such as cutting trees above the soil’s surface with a chain saw.”
Id. Today, the Corps regulates landclearing activities fairly broadly, in part due to changes
in the regulatory definition of “discharge of dredged material”, which will be discussed in the
next section.
B.

Ditching, Draining and Dredging

While the Clean Water Act 404 permit requirement is triggered by the “discharge of
dredged or fill material” into “waters of the United States”, “draining” a wetland, by pumping
out the water, constructing ditches outside of the wetlands to drain the water, or otherwise,
does not require a permit unless the draining activity involves a “discharge of dredged or fill
material” into the wetland. See Save Our Community v. EPA, 971 F.2d 1155 (5th Cir. 1992).
However, draining activities frequently involve “discharges of dredged or fill material,” and
when they do, they require a 404 permit.
In addition, since 1990, the Corps has taken the position that wetlands that are subject to
404 jurisdiction and are drained remain subject to 404 jurisdiction even after they are
drained, and a permit will be required for any subsequent filling activities on the converted
wetlands. See Memorandum from Lance Wood to All Division and District Counsels,
162

Evading 404 Jurisdiction by Pumping Water from Wetlands (Apr. 10, 1990). Since the
Corps and EPA define “wetlands” as areas that “under normal circumstances” support
wetland vegetation, the Corps has taken the position that wetlands that are drained remain
subject to jurisdiction because, “under normal circumstances” (i.e., if they had not been
drained), they would support wetland vegetation. Id. This reduces the incentive for
landowners to drain the wetlands, since the ultimate development activity will still require a
permit even though the draining may not.

“Dredging,” like “draining,” does not require a Section 404 permit unless there is some
discharge (addition of a pollutant) into the “waters of the United States” associated with the
dredging. The act of “dredging” is generally regulated under the Rivers and Harbors Act,
and similar laws. However, dredging in wetlands and other waters of the United States will
almost always involve some incidental redeposit of dredged material in the waters during
the dredging process. The Corps’ regulation of that material has evolved over the years.
In a 1986 rulemaking defining “discharge of dredged material,” the Corps noted that the
material that “incidentally” falls back into the water during the dredging process is
considered a “de minimis” discharge and does not require a permit. See 51 Fed. Reg.
41206, 41210 (Nov. 13, 1986). The regulation adopted at the time excluded “de minimis,
163

incidental soil movement occurring during normal dredging operations.” Id. at 41232. The
agency indicated that if it regulated the fallback, “we would, in effect, be adding the
regulation of dredging to section 404 which we do not believe was the intent of Congress.”
Id. at 41210.
The Corps changed its policy several years later in response to a lawsuit. In 1992, the
North Carolina Wildlife Federation sued the Corps of Engineers and Colonel Walter Tulloch,
the District Engineer for the Corps’ Wilmington District, because the Corps did not require a
landowner to apply for a section 404 permit when the landowner ditched and drained
wetlands to convert them and build a housing development. See North Carolina Wildlife
Federation, et al. v. Tulloch, E.D.N.C. C90-713-CIV-5-BO (E.D. N.C. 1992). Since the
ditching and draining only involved de minimis discharges of material into the wetlands, the
Corps had declined to require the developer to obtain a 404 permit. Id. In order to settle the
lawsuit, EPA and the Corps agreed to propose a revision and clarification of the definition
of “dredged or fill material.” See 58 Fed. Reg. 45007, 45008 (Aug. 25, 1993).
The Tulloch Rule: The regulations that the Corps and EPA adopted broadly defined
“discharge of dredged or fill material” to mean “any addition, including any redeposit, of
dredged material within the United States.” Id. at 45,035. The regulations also indicated
that the term included “any addition, including redeposit, of dredged material, into waters of
the United States which is incidental to any activity, including mechanized landclearing,
ditching, channelization and other excavation.” Id. At the same time, though, the regulations
provided that a permit was not required for “any incidental addition, including redeposit, of
dredged material associated with any activity that does not have or would not have the
effect of destroying or degrading an area of waters of the United States,” provided that the
person undertaking the activity demonstrated to the Corps or EPA, before undertaking the
activity, that it would not destroy or degrade an area of waters of the United States.” Id. In
effect, therefore, incidental fallback would be regulated unless a developer could
demonstrate that the fallback would not harm the wetlands or waters of the United States.
The rulemaking that the agencies issued to settle the lawsuit became known as “the
Tulloch Rule” (in reference to Colonel Tulloch, the defendant in the lawsuit).
The “Tulloch Rule” generated controversy and was challenged, and struck down, in the
following case:

In 1986 the Corps issued a
164

regulation defining the term "discharge of dredged material," as used in § 404, to mean
"any addition of dredged material into the waters of the United States," but expressly
excluding "de minimis, incidental soil movement occurring during normal dredging
operations." * * * In 1993, responding to litigation, the Corps issued a new rule removing
the de minimis exception and expanding the definition of discharge to cover "any addition of
dredged material into, including any redeposit of dredged material within, the waters of the
United States." 33 C.F.R. § 323.2(d)(1) (emphasis added). Redeposit occurs when material
removed from the water is returned to it; when redeposit takes place in substantially the
same spot as the initial removal, the parties refer to it as "fallback." In effect the new rule
subjects to federal regulation virtually all excavation and dredging performed in wetlands.
The plaintiffs, various trade associations whose members engage in dredging and
excavation, mounted a facial challenge to the 1993 regulation, claiming that it exceeded the
scope of the Corps's regulatory authority under the Act by regulating fallback. The district
court agreed and granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs. American Mining Congress
v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 951 F. Supp. 267 (D.D.C.1997). The district
court also entered an injunction prohibiting the Corps and the Environmental Protection
Agency, who jointly administer § 404, from enforcing the regulation anywhere in the United
States. Id. at 278. We affirm.
***
As mentioned above, the Tulloch Rule alters the preexisting regulatory framework primarily
by removing the de minimis exception and by adding coverage of incidental fallback.
Specifically, the rule defines "discharge of dredged material" to include "[a]ny addition,
including any redeposit, of dredged material, including excavated material, into waters of
the United States which is incidental to any activity, including mechanized landclearing,
ditching, channelization, or other excavation." 33 C.F.R. § 323.2(d)(1)(iii) (emphasis
added).3
***
It is undisputed that by requiring a permit for "any redeposit," 33 C.F.R. § 323.2(d)(1)(iii)
(emphasis added), the Tulloch Rule covers incidental fallback. According to the agencies,
incidental fallback occurs, for example, during dredging, "when a bucket used to excavate
material from the bottom of a river, stream, or wetland is raised and soils or sediments fall
from the bucket back into the water." Agencies Br. at 13 (There is no indication that the rule
would not also reach soils or sediments falling out of the bucket even before it emerged
from the water.) Fallback and other redeposits also occur during mechanized landclearing,
when bulldozers and loaders scrape or displace wetland soil, * * * as well as during
3

165

ditching and channelization, when draglines or backhoes are dragged through soils and
sediments. * * * Indeed, fallback is a practically inescapable by-product of all these
activities. In the preamble to the Tulloch Rule the Corps noted that "it is virtually impossible
to conduct mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or excavation in waters of the
United States without causing incidental redeposition of dredged material (however small or
temporary) in the process." * * * As a result, the Tulloch Rule effectively requires a permit
for all those activities, subject to a limited exception for ones that the Corps in its discretion
deems to produce no adverse effects on waters of the United States.
The plaintiffs claim that the Tulloch Rule exceeds the Corps's statutory jurisdiction under §
404, which, as we have noted, extends only to "discharge," defined as the "addition of any
pollutant to navigable waters." 33 U.S.C. §§ 1344, 1362(12). It argues that fallback, which
returns dredged material virtually to the spot from which it came, cannot be said to
constitute an addition of anything. Therefore, the plaintiffs contend, the Tulloch Rule
conflicts with the statute's unambiguous terms and cannot survive even the deferential
scrutiny called for by Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984).
***
The agencies argue that the terms of the Act in fact demonstrate that fallback may be
classified as a discharge. The Act defines a discharge as the addition of any pollutant to
navigable waters, 33 U.S.C. § 1362(12), and defines "pollutant" to include "dredged spoil,"
as well as "rock," "sand," and "cellar dirt." Id. § 1362(6). The Corps in turn defines "dredged
material" as "material that is excavated or dredged from waters of the United States," 33
C.F.R. § 323.2(c), a definition that is not challenged here. Thus, according to the agencies,
wetland soil, sediment, debris or other material in the waters of the United States
undergoes a legal metamorphosis during the dredging process, becoming a "pollutant" for
purposes of the Act. If a portion of the material being dredged then falls back into the water,
there has been an addition of a pollutant to the waters of the United States. Indeed,
according to appellants National Wildlife Federation et al. ("NWF"), who intervened as
defendants below, this reasoning demonstrates that regulation of redeposit is actually
required by the Act.
We agree with the plaintiffs, and with the district court, that the straightforward statutory
term "addition" cannot reasonably be said to encompass the situation in which material is
removed from the waters of the United States and a small portion of it happens to fall back.
Because incidental fallback represents a net withdrawal, not an addition, of material, it
cannot be a discharge. As we concluded recently in a related context, "the nearest
evidence we have of definitional intent by Congress reflects, as might be expected, that the
word 'discharge' contemplates the addition, not the withdrawal, of a substance or
substances." North Carolina v. FERC, 112 F.3d 1175, 1187 (D.C. Cir.1997). The agencies'
primary counterargument--that fallback constitutes an "addition of any pollutant" because
material becomes a pollutant only upon being dredged--is ingenious but unconvincing.
166

Regardless of any legal metamorphosis that may occur at the moment of dredging, we fail
to see how there can be an addition of dredged material when there is no addition of
material. Although the Act includes "dredged spoil" in its list of pollutants, 33 U.S.C. §
1362(6), Congress could not have contemplated that the attempted removal of 100 tons of
that substance could constitute an addition simply because only 99 tons of it were actually
taken away. * * *
In fact the removal of material from the waters of the United States, as opposed to the
discharge of material into those waters, is governed by a completely independent statutory
scheme. Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. § 403, makes it
illegal "to excavate or fill" in the navigable waters of the United States without the Corps's
approval. As the general counsel of the Army noted in a law review article published a few
years after the passage of the Clean Water Act, Congress enacted "two separate statutory
frameworks. Section 10 of the 1899 Act covers the act of dredging, while Section 404 [of
the Clean Water Act] covers the disposal of the dredged material." * * *
The agencies, though acknowledging that the Tulloch Rule effectively requires a permit for
all mechanized landclearing, ditching, channelization or excavation in waters of the United
States, * * * locate their permitting requirement under § 404, not under the Rivers and
Harbors Act's explicit coverage of "excavat[ion]." The explanation for this choice is
apparently that the scope of the Corps's geographic jurisdiction is narrower under the
Rivers and Harbors Act than under the Clean Water Act, extending only to waters subject to
the ebb and flow of the tide, or waters that are used, have been used, or may be
susceptible for use to transport interstate or foreign commerce. 33 C.F.R. § 329.4; see also
id. § 328.1 (noting difference between geographic jurisdiction under the two statutes).
There may be an incongruity in Congress's assignment of extraction activities to a statute
(the Rivers and Harbors Act) with a narrower jurisdictional sweep than that of the statute
covering discharges (the Clean Water Act). This incongruity, of course, could be cured
either by narrowing the jurisdictional reach of the Clean Water Act or broadening that of the
Rivers and Harbors Act. But we do not think the agencies can do it simply by declaring that
incomplete removal constitutes addition.
***
NWF complains that our understanding of "addition" reads the regulation of dredged
material out of the statute. They correctly note that since dredged material comes from the
waters of the United States, 33 C.F.R. § 323.2(c), any discharge of such material into those
waters could technically be described as a "redeposit," at least on a broad construction of
that term. The Fifth Circuit made a similar observation fifteen years ago: " '[D]redged'
material is by definition material that comes from the water itself. A requirement that all
pollutants must come from outside sources would effectively remove the dredge-and-fill
provision from the statute." Avoyelles Sportsmen's League v. Marsh, 715 F.2d 897, 924
167

n.43 (5th Cir. 1983). But we do not hold that the Corps may not legally regulate some forms
of redeposit under its § 404 permitting authority.6 We hold only that by asserting jurisdiction
over "any redeposit," including incidental fallback, the Tulloch Rule outruns the Corps's
statutory authority. Since the Act sets out no bright line between incidental fallback on the
one hand and regulable redeposits on the other, a reasoned attempt by the agencies to
draw such a line would merit considerable deference. Cf. Dubois v. U.S. Dep't of
Agriculture, 102 F.3d 1273, 1296-99 (1st Cir. 1996) (although movement of pollutants
within the same body of water might not constitute an "addition" for purposes of NPDES
permit requirement, movement from one body of water to a separate one with different
water quality is an addition). But the Tulloch Rule makes no effort to draw such a line, and
indeed its overriding purpose appears to be to expand the Corps's permitting authority to
encompass incidental fallback and, as a result, a wide range of activities that cannot
remotely be said to "add" anything to the waters of the United States.
***
In a press release accompanying the adoption of the Tulloch Rule, the White House
announced: "Congress should amend the Clean Water Act to make it consistent with the
agencies' rulemaking." * * * While remarkable in its candor, the announcement contained a
kernel of truth. If the agencies and NWF believe that the Clean Water Act inadequately
protects wetlands and other natural resources by insisting upon the presence of an
"addition" to trigger permit requirements, the appropriate body to turn to is Congress.
Without such an amendment, the Act simply will not accommodate the Tulloch Rule. The
judgment of the district court is
Affirmed.
SILBERMAN, Circuit Judge, concurring:
I join the opinion of the court and write separately only to make explicit what I think implicit
in our opinion. We hold that the Corps's interpretation of the phrase "addition of any
pollutant to navigable waters" to cover incidental fallback is "unreasonable," which is the
formulation we use when we have first determined under Chevron that neither the statutory
language nor legislative history reveals a precise intent with respect to the issue presented-in other words, we are at the second step of the now-familiar Chevron Step I and Step II
analysis. See, e.g., Whitecliff, Inc. v. Shalala, 20 F.3d 488 (D.C. Cir.1994); Fedway
Associates, Inc. v. United States Treasury, 976 F.2d 1416 (D.C. Cir.1992); Abbott Labs. v.
Young, 920 F.2d 984 (D.C. Cir.1990); Associated Gas Distribs. v. FERC, 899 F.2d 1250
(D.C. Cir.1990). As our opinion's discussion of prior cases indicates, the word addition
carries both a temporal and geographic ambiguity. If the material that would otherwise fall

redeposit could be an addition to [a] new location and thus a discharge." Plaintiffs' Br. at 17.
168

back were moved some distance away and then dropped, it very well might constitute an
"addition." Or if it were held for some time and then dropped back in the same spot, it might
also constitute an "addition." But the structure of the relevant statutes indicates that it is
unreasonable to call incidental fallback an addition. To do so perforce converts all
dredging--which is regulated under the Rivers and Harbors Act--into discharge of dredged
material which is regulated under the Clean Water Act.
Moreover, that Congress had in mind either a temporal or geographic separation between
excavation and disposal is suggested by its requirement that dredged material be
discharged at "specified disposal sites," 33 U.S.C. § 1344 (1994), a term which simply does
not fit incidental fallback.

Questions and Comments
1.

Did this lawsuit arise in the context of an enforcement action? Had the Corps
applied the Tulloch rule to require members of the National Mining Association to
obtain permits for the incidental fallback during mining activities? If not, why was
there no problem with standing or ripeness of the challenge? Chapter 3
(Administrative Law) and Chapter 10 (Administrative Appeals, Enforcement and
Judicial Review) will examine questions like this in more detail.

2.

Does the court resolve the case at Chevron step one or two? Is the statutory
language clear?

3.

What impact, if any, does the court’s opinion, have on the Corps’ regulation of “fill
material” under the Clean Water Act?

4.

The court appears to leave open the possibility that the Corps can require a Section
404 permit for some redeposit of material that occurs during dredging in wetlands
and waters of the United States. In what circumstances might it be appropriate to
require a permit? Is that inconsistent with the majority’s statement that incidental
fallback cannot be a discharge because it “represents a net withdrawal, not an
addition, of material”?

5.

If, as the court notes, dredging activities are already regulated under the Rivers and
Harbors Act, why didn’t the Corps rely on its Rivers and Harbors Act authority to
protect wetlands?

6.

Take a moment to review the APA’s standards for judicial review of agency action,
particularly 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). What do you think about the White House’s press
release in light of those standards?
169

Post-script: In the wake of the D.C. Circuit’s ruling, thousands of acres of wetlands were
ditched and converted to other uses. See Carl H. Herschner, Tulloch Drilling, Wetlands
Technical Report 99-4 (Virginia Institute of Marine Science, May 1999). The Virginia
Institute of Marine Science at the College of William and Mary estimated that 12,000 acres
of wetlands in North Carolina and Virginia alone were converted through “Tulloch ditching”
in the year after the decision. Id. In an attempt to limit those impacts, the agencies, in a
1999 rulemaking, interpreted the National Mining Association decision narrowly to prohibit
the regulation of “incidental fallback,” but to allow regulation of other redeposit of material in
waters of the United States. See 64 Fed. Reg. 25120 (May 10, 1999).
Tulloch II: Only two years later, the agencies amended their regulations and to clarify the
definition of “discharge of dredged material.” The regulations that the agencies adopted in
2001 defined “discharge of dredged material” as “any addition of dredged material into,
including any redeposit of dredged material other than incidental fallback within, the waters
of the United States.” See 66 Fed. Reg. 4550 (Jan. 17, 2001). The agencies defined
“incidental fallback” as “the redeposit of small volumes of dredged material that is incidental
to excavation activity in waters of the United States when such material falls back in
substantially the same place as the initial removal.” (emphasis added). Id.
More controversially, though, the agencies included a presumption in the rule that “the use
of mechanized earth-moving equipment to conduct landclearing, ditching, channelization,
instream mining or other earth-moving activity in waters of the United States” results in a
discharge of dredged material “unless project-specific evidence shows that the activity
results in only incidental fallback. Id. Those regulations (“Tulloch II”) were codified at 33
C.F.R. § 323.2 (2002).
Not surprisingly, the regulations generated more controversy and the National Association
of Home Builders and several other industry trade organizations challenged the rule as
exceeding the Corps’ authority under the Clean Water Act, the APA, and the Tenth
Amendment of the Constitution. See National Association of Home Builders v. U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, No. 01-0274, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6366 (D.D.C. 2007). In 2007, the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia held that the agency’s definition of
“incidental fallback” was invalid and enjoined the agency from enforcing and applying that
definition. Id. at *15. The court held that the Corps should have defined “incidental fallback”
in terms of the amount of time that material was removed from waters, in addition to the
location where it was replaced, and that the agency should not have defined it with respect
to the volume of the material being removed. Id. at *11-*13. In light of the court’s decision,
EPA and the Corps re-adopted the definition of “discharge of dredged material” that they
adopted in 1999, which did not include a definition for “incidental fallback” or the
presumption that the use of mechanized earth moving equipment results in a discharge of
dredged material. See 73 Fed. Reg. 79641 (Dec. 30, 2008). The current definition is
codified at 33 C.F.R. § 323.2 (2013).

1997, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit could not
reach consensus on whether “sidecasting” required a Section 404 permit. See United
States v. Wilson, 133 F.3d 251 (4th Cir. 1997). However, three years later, a different panel
of the Fourth Circuit concluded that “sidecasting” requires a 404 permit in the United States
v. Deaton case, which follows.

MICHAEL, Circuit Judge:

The United States sued James and Rebecca Deaton, alleging that they violated §§ 301 and
404 of the Clean Water Act, * * * by sidecasting dredged material as they dug a drainage
ditch through a wetland. The district court ultimately awarded summary judgment to the
Deatons, and the government appeals. We reverse, holding that sidecasting in a
jurisdictional wetland is the discharge of a pollutant under the Clean Water Act. We dismiss
the Deatons' cross-appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
I
On November 22, 1988, James Deaton signed a contract to buy a twelve-acre parcel of
land in Wicomico County, Maryland, subject to the condition that it was suitable for
developing a small residential subdivision. Deaton immediately applied to the Wicomico
County Health Department for a sewage disposal permit for a five-lot "single family
subdivision." The Health Department denied the permit on April 26, 1989, because the
groundwater elevations were unacceptably high at the disposal sites proposed by Deaton
and his consultant. The department commented that "[t]he majority of the parcel... is very
poorly drained and would severely restrict the function of the onsite sewage disposal
systems." There was a "very limited area" that might warrant evaluation, the department
said, if it proved to be within the property boundary. In late April 1989, after the permit was
denied, Deaton contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service
(SCS), to discuss the wetness problem on the twelve-acre parcel. Deaton was referred to
Glen Richardson, who agreed to examine the site. According to Deaton, Richardson
suggested that the problem could be corrected by digging a ditch through the middle of the
property. Deaton and his wife (Rebecca) decided to go ahead with the purchase of the
land, and title was transferred to them in June 1989.
Before any ditching work began, the property was also inspected by Michael Sigrist, District
Conservationist at the SCS in Wicomico County. Deaton and Sigrist walked over the
property together, and Deaton told Sigrist that he wanted to dig a large ditch to drain the
area. Sigrist saw hydric soils (which are typical of wetland areas), areas of standing water,
"a large, low wet area" in the center of the parcel, and non-tidal wetlands. Water was
flowing from the property into a culvert that connects to (or is part of) Perdue Creek. (The
waters of Perdue Creek end up in the Wicomico River, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay.)
Sigrist advised Deaton that a large portion of his property contained non-tidal wetlands and
that he would need a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) before
172

undertaking any ditching work. Deaton ignored Sigrist's advice and hired a contractor to dig
a drainage ditch across the property. Using a back hoe, a front-end track loader, and a
bulldozer, the contractor dug a 1,240 foot ditch that intersected the areas that Sigrist had
identified as wetlands. As he dug, the contractor piled the excavated dirt on either side of
the ditch, a practice known as sidecasting.
In July 1990 the Corps learned of possible Clean Water Act violations on the Deaton
property. A Corps ecologist, Alex Dolgos, inspected the site and concluded that it contained
wetlands, that those wetlands were "waters of the United States" under the Clean Water
Act, and that the ditching and fill work that had taken place required a permit. On August 7
and 8, 1990, the Corps issued stop-work orders to Deaton and his contractor, warning them
that their placement of fill material in a non-tidal wetland violated § 404 of the Clean Water
Act, * * * and that no further work should be done without a permit. Deaton filed a joint
state and federal application in December 1990, seeking permits to ditch and fill wetlands in
order to construct an eighteen-lot subdivision. That application was returned as incomplete
on February 15, 1991, and was never resubmitted. Over the next three years Deaton
engaged several consultants to inspect the property, negotiate with the Corps, and prepare
a remediation plan. No remediation ever took place, however, and on July 21, 1995, the
government filed a civil complaint alleging that the Deatons had violated the Clean Water
Act by discharging fill material (the dirt excavated from the ditch) into a regulated wetland.
***
[In the district court, both parties moved for summary judgment. The court initially granted
partial summary judgment to the government, holding that sidecasting into wetlands on the
property was the “discharge of a pollutant.” However, while the litigation in the district court
continued, the 4th Circuit issued the United States v. Wilson decision described above.
Although there was no majority holding in that case regarding whether sidecasting is
regulated under Section 404, the district court vacated its prior determination that
sidecasting was the “discharge of a pollutant’ and granted summary judgment for the
Deatons. The government then appealed.] * * *
II.
The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge, without a permit, of any pollutant into
“navigable waters.” See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311(a), 1362(6), (7), (12). * * *
The Corps argues and we assume for purposes of this appeal that the Deatons' property
contains wetlands that are subject to the Clean Water Act. The narrow issue before us
today is whether sidecasting (that is, the deposit of dredged or excavated material from a
wetland back into that same wetland) constitutes the discharge of a pollutant under the
Clean Water Act. We hold that it does.

173

The Clean Water Act defines "discharge of a pollutant" to mean "any addition of any
pollutant to navigable waters from any point source." 33 U.S.C. § 1362(12)(A). The
definition of pollutant, in turn, specifically includes "dredged spoil" that has been
"discharged into water." Id. § 1362(6). The piles of dirt dredged up by the Deatons'
contractor were, without question, "pollutants" within the meaning of the Act. See Wilson,
133 F.3d at 259 (op. of Niemeyer, J.) ("[D]redged materials, including the native soils
excavated by ditching activities, may constitute a pollutant within the meaning of the Clean
Water Act."); id. at 269, 274 & n.12 (op. of Payne, J.) (dredged earth is a pollutant). This
conclusion, instead of resolving the dispute, merely brings us to its center because the
parties disagree fundamentally about what it means to "discharge... a pollutant" into the
waters of the United States.
The Deatons seize on the word "addition" in the phrase "addition of any pollutant" in the
statutory definition of discharge. 18 U.S.C. § 1362(12). They argue that the "ordinary and
natural meaning of `addition' means something added, i.e., the addition of something not
previously present." * * * Thus, according to the Deatons, no pollutant is discharged unless
there is an "introduction of new material into the area, or an increase in the amount of a
type of material which is already present." Wilson, 133 F.3d at 259 (op. of Niemeyer, J.).
Because sidecasting results in no net increase in the amount of material present in the
wetland, the Deatons argue, it does not involve the "addition" (or discharge) of a pollutant.
See National Mining Ass'n v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 145 F.3d 1399, 1404 (D.C.
Cir. 1998) ("[W]e fail to see how there can be an addition of dredged material when there is
no addition of material."). We are not convinced by this argument.
Contrary to what the Deatons suggest, the statute does not prohibit the addition of material;
it prohibits "the addition of any pollutant." The idea that there could be an addition of a
pollutant without an addition of material seems to us entirely unremarkable, at least when
an activity transforms some material from a nonpollutant into a pollutant, as occurred here.
In the course of digging a ditch across the Deaton property, the contractor removed earth
and vegetable matter from the wetland. Once it was removed, that material became
"dredged spoil," a statutory pollutant and a type of material that up until then was not
present on the Deaton property. It is of no consequence that what is now dredged spoil was
previously present on the same property in the less threatening form of dirt and vegetation
in an undisturbed state. What is important is that once that material was excavated from
the wetland, its redeposit in that same wetland added a pollutant where none had been
before. See 33 U.S.C. § 1362 (6), (12). Thus, even under the definition of "addition" (that is,
"something added") offered by the Deatons, sidecasting adds a pollutant that was not
present before.
Although we conclude that the Clean Water Act's definition of discharge and its use of the
term "addition" are unambiguous, the underlying rationale for defining dredged spoil as a
pollutant provides further support for our conclusion. In deciding to classify dredged spoil as
a pollutant, Congress determined that plain dirt, once excavated from waters of the United
174

States, could not be redeposited into those waters without causing harm to the
environment. Indeed, several seemingly benign substances like rock, sand, cellar dirt, and
biological materials are specifically designated as pollutants under the Clean Water Act.
See 33 U.S.C. § 1362(6). Congress had good reason to be concerned about the
reintroduction of these materials into the waters of the United States, including the wetlands
that are a part of those waters.
Wetlands perform a vital role in maintaining water quality by trapping sediment and toxic
and nontoxic pollutants before they reach streams, rivers, or other open bodies of water.
See Office of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress, Wetlands: Their Use and
Regulation 48-50 (1984). Given sufficient time, many (but not all) of these pollutants will
decompose, degrade, or be absorbed by wetland vegetation. See id. at 48-49. When a
wetland is dredged, however, and the dredged spoil is redeposited in the water or wetland,
pollutants that had been trapped may be suddenly released. See id. at 49 ("Natural or
manmade alterations of the wetland caused by lowering the water table, dredging, and the
like, could mobilize large quantities of toxic materials."); id. at 124 ("A long-term effect of the
disposal of contaminated dredged spoil in or near wetlands is the potential bioavailability of
toxic chemicals such as oil and grease, pesticides, arsenic, and heavy metals, when the
sediments are resuspended periodically."); Wilson, 133 F.3d at 273-74 (op. of Payne, J.)
(describing how sidecasting dredged material threatens to release pollutants contained in
sub-surface soil). At the same time, the increased drainage brought about by the dredging
may render the surrounding wetland unable to reabsorb and filter those pollutants and
sediment (the very purpose of dredging is to destroy wetland characteristics). 40 C.F.R. §
230.41(b) (explaining how discharge of dredged or fill material in wetlands "can degrade
water quality by obstructing circulation patterns that flush large expanses of wetland
systems, by interfering with the filtration function of wetlands, or by changing the aquifer
recharge capability of a wetland"). Even in a pristine wetland or body of water, the
discharge of dredged spoil, rock, sand, and biological materials threatens to increase the
amount of suspended sediment, harming aquatic life. See id.; Office of Technology
Assessment, supra, at 48; see also Wilson, 133 F.3d at 274 (op. of Payne, J.).
These effects are no less harmful when the dredged spoil is redeposited in the same
wetland from which it was excavated. The effects on hydrology and the environment are
the same. Surely Congress would not have used the word "addition" (in “addition of any
pollutant") to prohibit the discharge of dredged spoil in a wetland, while intending to prohibit
such pollution only when the dredged material comes from outside the wetland. In reaching
this conclusion, our understanding of the word "addition" is the same as that of nearly every
other circuit to consider the question. See Avoyelles Sportsmen's League, Inc. v. Marsh,
715 F.2d 897, 923-25 (5th Cir. 1983) (interpretation of "addition" to include "redeposit" of
trees and vegetation dredged or excavated from the wetland itself is consistent with both
the purposes and legislative history of the Clean Water Act); United States v. M.C.C. of
Florida, Inc., 772 F.2d 1501, 1506 (11th Cir. 1985) (redeposit of spoil churned up by
tugboat propellers constituted the discharge of a pollutant under the Clean Water Act),
175

vacated and remanded on other grounds, 481 U.S. 1034 (1987), readopted in relevant part,
848 F.2d 1133 (11th Cir. 1988); Rybachek v. EPA, 904 F.2d 1276, 1285 (9th Cir. 1990) (dirt
and gravel extracted by gold miners and redeposited into the stream bed from which it was
extracted constituted an "addition" of a pollutant under the Clean Water Act); see also
United States v. Bay-Houston Towing Co., 33 F. Supp.2d 596, 606 (E.D. Mich. 1999)
(adopting reasoning of Judge Payne's Wilson opinion). But cf. National Mining Ass'n, 145
F.3d at 1404, 1406 (concluding that "incidental fallback" of dredged material into waterway
does not constitute the addition of a pollutant, but distinguishing between incidental fallback
and sidecasting).
For these reasons, we hold that the Clean Water Act's definition of discharge as "any
addition of any pollutant to navigable waters" encompasses sidecasting in a wetland. We
therefore reverse the district court's June 23, 1998, judgment to the contrary.
Questions and Comments
1.

Transformation: The court seems to concede that no “material” is being added to
the wetlands in the case, but holds that “pollutants” are being added. How can
pollutants be added when no material is added?

2.

Is the court suggesting that sidecasting always constitutes an addition of a
pollutant? What is the basis for the court’s determination that it is appropriate for the
Corps to regulate sidecasting in this case? The plain meaning of the statutory
terms? Legislative history? The purposes of the statute?

3.

Time and Place Matter: Although the Deatons seek to rely on the D.C. Circuit’s
National Mining Association decision, what direction, if any, did that court provide
regarding whether, or when, the Corps could regulate redeposit of material in waters
of the United States? Did that court address the issue of sidecasting?

D.

Deep Ripping

Another activity that alters wetlands or other waters of the United States, but does not
involve the addition of material from outside of those waters is “deep ripping.” Deep ripping
is a technique used to break up compacted soil, and involves dragging four to seven foot
metal blades through the soil. It is generally used to improve site drainage and facilitate
deep root growth. Like sidecasting, the activity involves only redeposit of material that was
previously in the waters into which it is being placed. However, because the activity can
destroy the hydrological integrity of wetlands, the Corps generally requires a Section 404
permit for deep ripping. See Regulatory Guidance Letter 96-02, Applicability of Exemptions
under Section 404(f) to “Deep Ripping” Activities in Wetlands (Dec. 12, 1996). The United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed the Corps’ authority to regulate
deep-ripping in the Borden Ranch Partnership v. United States Army Corps of Engineers
176

HAWKINS, Circuit Judge:

This appeal concerns the authority of the
U.S. Army Corpsof Engineers ("the Corps")
and the Environmental Protection Agency
("EPA") over a form of agricultural activity
called "deep ripping" when it occurs in wetlands. We conclude that the Clean Water Act
applies to this activity and affirm the district court's findings that Borden Ranch violated the
Act by deep ripping in protected wetland swales. * * *
Facts and Procedural Background
In June of 1993, Angelo Tsakopoulos, a Sacramento real estate developer, purchased
Borden Ranch, an 8400 acre ranch located in California's Central Valley. Prior to
Tsakopoulos's purchase, the relevant areas of the ranch had been used primarily as
rangeland for cattle grazing. The ranch contains significant hydrological features including
vernal pools, swales, and intermittent drainages. Vernal pools are pools that form during
the rainy season, but are often dry in the summer. Swales are sloped wetlands that allow
for the movement of aquatic plant and animal life, and that filter water flows and minimize
erosion. Intermittent drainages are streams that transport water during and after rains. All of
these hydrological features depend upon a dense layer of soil, called a "restrictive layer" or
"clay pan,” which prevents surface water from penetrating deeply into the soil.
Tsakopoulos intended to convert the ranch into vineyards and orchards and subdivide it
into smaller parcels for sale. Vineyards and orchards, however, require deep root systems,
much deeper than the restrictive layer in the relevant portions of Borden Ranch permitted.
For vineyards and orchards to grow on this land, the restrictive layer of soil would first need
to be penetrated. This requires a procedure known as “deep ripping," in which four-to
seven-foot long metal prongs are dragged through the soil behind a tractor or a bulldozer.
The ripper gouges through the restrictive layer, disgorging soil that is then dragged behind
the ripper.
Under the Clean Water Act, an individual seeking to fill protected wetlands must first obtain
a permit from the Corps. Since 1993, Tsakopoulos and the Corps have disagreed about the
Corps' authority to regulate deep ripping in wetlands. Tsakopoulos initiated deep ripping
without a permit in the fall of 1993, and the Corps granted him a retrospective permit in the
177

spring of 1994, when Tsakopoulos agreed to various mitigation requirements. In the fall of
1994, the Corps and the EPA informed Tsakopoulos that he could deep rip in uplands and
that he could drive over swales with the deep ripper in its uppermost position, but that he
could not conduct any deep ripping activity in vernal pools. The next spring, the Corps
discovered that deep ripping had occurred in protected wetlands and promptly issued a
cease and desist order. From July 1995 through November 1995, Tsakopoulos again
initiated deep ripping on various parcels of land without a permit. The Corps concluded that
more protected wetlands had been ripped and again issued a cease and desist order.
In May of 1996, the Corps and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent
with Tsakopoulos that was intended to resolve his alleged Clean Water Act violations.
Under the agreement, Tsakopoulos set aside a 1368-acre preserve and agreed to refrain
from further violations.
***
In March of 1997 the Corps concluded that Tsakopoulos had continued to deep rip
wetlands without permission. That April, EPA investigators visited the ranch and observed
fully engaged deep rippers passing over jurisdictional wetlands. EPA then issued an
Administrative Order to Tsakopoulos.
Tsakopoulos responded by filing this lawsuit, challenging the authority of the Corps and the
EPA to regulate deep ripping. The United States filed a counterclaim seeking injunctive
relief and civil penalties for Tsakopoulos's alleged violations of the Clean Water Act.
Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The district court ruled that the Corps has
jurisdiction over deep ripping in jurisdictional waters. However, the court found disputed
facts with respect to whether such deep ripping had actually occurred. These facts were
litigated in a bench trial that began on August 24, 1999, and concluded on September 16,
1999. The district court heard evidence from over twenty witnesses and received hundreds
of documentary exhibits.
The district court subsequently entered findings of fact and conclusions of law determining
that Tsakopoulos had repeatedly violated the Clean Water Act. The court found 348
separate deep ripping violations in 29 drainages, and 10 violations in a single vernal pool.
The district court gave Tsakopoulos the option of paying a $1.5 million penalty or paying
$500,000 and restoring four acres of wetlands. Tsakopoulos chose the latter option. After
denying a motion for more specific findings of fact, the district court entered its final order in
favor of the United States.
Tsakopoulos then brought this timely appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§
1291.

Analysis
Corps Jurisdiction over Deep Ripping
***
A.

Discharge of a Pollutant

Tsakopoulos initially contends that deep ripping cannot constitute the "addition" of a
"pollutant” into wetlands, because it simply churns up soil that is already there, placing it
back basically where it came from. This argument is inconsistent with Ninth Circuit
precedent and with case law from other circuits that squarely hold that redeposits of
materials can constitute an "addition of a pollutant" under the Clean Water Act. Rybachek v.
United States Envtl. Prot. Agency, 904 F.2d 1276 (9th Cir. 1990), considered a claim that
placer mining activities were exempt from the Act. We held that removing material from a
stream bed, sifting out the gold, and returning the material to the stream bed was an
“addition" of a "pollutant." Id. at 1285. The term “pollutant" encompassed "the materials
segregated from gold in placer mining." Id.
Our reasoning in Rybachek is similar to that of the Fourth Circuit in United States v.
Deaton, 209 F.3d 331 (4th Cir. 2000). In Deaton, a property owner alleged that the Corps
could not regulate "sidecasting," which is “the deposit of dredged or excavated material
from a wetland back into that same wetland." Id. at 334. The property owner asserted that
"sidecasting results in no net increase in the amount of material present in the wetland" and
therefore could not constitute the "addition of a pollutant." Id. at 335. The Fourth Circuit
squarely rejected this argument, in language that is worth quoting in full:
Contrary to what the Deatons suggest, the statute does not prohibit the addition of
material; it prohibits the "addition of any pollutant." The idea that there could be an
addition of a pollutant without an addition of material seems to us entirely
unremarkable, at least when an activity transforms some material from a
nonpollutant into a pollutant, as occurred here . . . . Once [earth and vegetable
matter] was removed [from the wetland], that material became "dredged spoil," a
statutory pollutant and a type of material that up until then was not present on the
Deaton property. It is of no consequence that what is now dredged spoil was
previously present on the same property in the less threatening form of dirt and
vegetation in an undisturbed state. What is important is that once that material was
excavated from the wetland, its redeposit in that same wetland added a pollutant
where none had been before.
Id. at 335-36. As the court concluded, "Congress determined that plain dirt, once excavated
from waters of the United States, could not be redeposited into those waters without
causing harm to the environment." Id. at 336; see also Avoyelles Sportsmen's League, Inc.
179

v. Marsh, 715 F.2d 897, 923 (5th Cir. 1983) (holding that the word "addition" may be
reasonably understood to include "redeposit").
These cases recognize that activities that destroy the ecology of a wetland are not immune
from the Clean Water Act merely because they do not involve the introduction of material
brought in from somewhere else. In this case, the Corps alleges that Tsakopoulos has
essentially poked a hole in the bottom of protected wetlands. That is, by ripping up the
bottom layer of soil, the water that was trapped can now drain out. While it is true, that in so
doing, no new material has been "added," a "pollutant" has certainly been "added." Prior to
the deep ripping, the protective layer of soil was intact, holding the wetland in place.
Afterwards, that soil was wrenched up, moved around, and redeposited somewhere else.
We can see no meaningful distinction between this activity and the activities at issue in
Rybachek and Deaton. We therefore conclude that deep ripping, when undertaken in the
context at issue here, can constitute a discharge of a pollutant under the Clean Water Act. 2
Tsakopoulos also contends that no case has ever held a plow to be a point source, and
that a prohibited discharge must be from a point source. This argument has no merit. The
statutory definition of "point source" ("any discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance")
is extremely broad, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1362(14), and courts have found that “bulldozers and
backhoes" can constitute "point sources,” Avoyelles, 715 F.2d at 922. In this case,
bulldozers and tractors were used to pull large metal prongs through the soil. We can think
of no reason why this combination would not satisfy the definition of a "point source."
[The court also concluded that the deep ripping did not fit within the “normal farming
operations” exemption from the 404 permit requirements because the purpose of the deep
ripping was to “bring an area of the navigable waters into a use to which it was not
previously subject.” 33 U.S.C. § 1344(f)(2).]
***
GOULD, Circuit Judge, dissenting:
I respectfully dissent. The crux of this case is that a farmer has plowed deeply to improve
his farm property to permit farming of fruit crops that require deep root systems, and are
more profitable than grazing or other prior farm use. Farmers have been altering and
transforming their crop land from the beginning of our nation, and indeed in colonial times.
2

National Mining Assoc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, 145 F.3d 1399 (D.C. Cir. 1998),
upon which Tsakopoulos heavily relies, does not persuade us to the contrary. That case
distinguished "regulable redeposits" from "incidental fallback." Id. at 1405. Here, the deep
ripping does not involve mere incidental fallback, but constitutes environmental damage
sufficient to constitute a regulable redeposit.
180

Although I have no doubt that Congress could have reached and regulated the farming
activity challenged, that does not in itself show that Congress so exercised its power. I
conclude that the Clean Water Act does not prohibit "deep ripping" in this setting.
I would follow and extend National Mining Association v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
145 F.3d 1399 (D.C. Cir. 1998), and hold that the return of soil in place after deep plowing
is not a "discharge of a pollutant." In National Mining, the court held that the Corps
exceeded its authority under section 404 of the Clean Water Act by regulating the redeposit
of dredged materials that incidentally fall back in the course of dredging operations. The
court explained that "the straightforward statutory term `addition' cannot reasonably be said
to encompass the situation in which material is removed from the waters of the United
States and a small portion of it happens to fall back." Id. at 1404. The court rejected the
agencies' primary argument that incidental fallback constitutes an "addition" because once
dredged the material becomes a pollutant:
Regardless of any legal metamorphosis that may occur at the moment of dredging,
we fail to see how there can be an addition of dredged material when there is no
addition of material. Although the Act includes "dredged spoil" in its list of pollutants,
Congress could not have contemplated that the attempted removal of 100 tons of
that substance could constitute [*820] an addition simply because only 99 tons of it
were actually taken away.
Id. at 1404 (emphasis omitted).
Those considerations are persuasive here as deep ripping does not involve any significant
removal or "addition" of material to the site. The ground is plowed and transformed. It is
true that the hydrological regime is modified, but Congress spoke in terms of discharge or
addition of pollutants, not in terms of change of the hydrological nature of the soil. If
Congress intends to prohibit so natural a farm activity as plowing, and even the deep
plowing that occurred here, Congress can and should be explicit. Although we interpret the
prohibitions of the Clean Water Act to effectuate Congressional intent, it is an undue stretch
for us, absent a more clear directive from Congress, to reach and prohibit the plowing done
here, which seems to be a traditional form of farming activity.
Rybachek v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 904 F.2d 1276 (9th Cir.
1990), in my view, is distinguishable. In Rybachek, we held that placer mining, "a process
in which miners excavate dirt and gravel in and around waterways and, after extracting the
gold, discharge the left-over material back into the water," fell within the scope of section
404 of the Clean Water Act. Id. at 1285. There, the Rybachek court identified the regulable
discharge as the discrete act of dumping leftover material into the stream after it had been
processed. Id. As the concurrence in National Mining makes clear, however, "the word
addition carries both a temporal and geographic ambiguity. If the material that would
otherwise fall back were moved some distance away and then dropped, it very well might
181

constitute an `addition.' Or if it were held for some time and then dropped back in the same
spot, it might also constitute an `addition.' “National Mining, 145 F.3d at 1410 (Silberman,
J., concurring). Because deep ripping does not move any material to a substantially
different geographic location and does not process such material for any period of time,
Rybachek is not controlling.
Nor is the Fourth Circuit's opinion in United States v. Deaton, 209 F.3d 331 (4th Cir. 2000),
relied on by the majority, persuasive to me in the context presented. A farmer who plows
deeply is not, in my view, redepositing dredged or excavated materials. While the Fourth
Circuit relied on the fact that a "dredged spoil" is a statutory pollutant, the deep plowing
activity here, in my view, is not the same as dredging dirt from and redepositing it in waters.
Questions and Comments
1.

The majority cites the Rybacheck and Deaton cases in support of its decision. Is it
relevant that those cases involved redeposit of material in a different place or at a
different time? Is it important that the court suggests that the soil is “dragged behind
the ripper”? The dissent refers to the “return of soil in place.”

2.

The majority adopts the transformation theory that Deaton adopted and National
Mining Association rejected. Is the ruling based on the text of the statute, legislative
history, or the purposes of the statute? On what does the dissent rely?

3.

On appeal, Tsakopoulos argued that the Corps had relied on RGL 96-02 to
determine that a permit was required for his deep ripping and that the guidance was
invalid because it was a substantive rule that was not adopted pursuant to notice
and comment rulemaking. The court declined to address the issue because it was
not addressed below. The district court did, however, determine that it was not clear
that the Corps relied on the guidance in determining that a permit was required in
the case. If the appellate court had addressed Tskopoulos’ challenge to RGL 96-02,
how might the court have ruled?

182

4.

On Tsakopoulos’ petition for certiorari, the Supreme Court agreed to review the
Ninth Circuit’s decision. Justice Kennedy, born and raised in Sacramento, California,
was a friend of Tsakopoulos, the Sacramento real estate developer, so Kennedy did
not participate in the case. Without his involvement, the Court split 4-4 and,
therefore, affirmed the Ninth Circuit’s decision, which upheld the Corps’ jurisdiction
over deep ripping. See Borden Ranch Partnership v. Army Corps of Engineers, 537
U.S. 99 (2002).
Hypothetical
Jeremy and Casey Wright purchased an 80 acre tract of land in northern Minnesota near the
Saint Louis River. The Wrights planned to build a house on the property, but discovered that 60
acres of the property were wetlands that are regulated as “waters of the United States” under the
Clean Water Act. Rather than building the house on the 20 acres that are not wetlands, Jeremy
rented a backhoe and dug a ditch in the wetlands located on the western portion of the property
to drain those wetlands. Jeremy used most of the excavated material to level an upland portion
of the property where he planned to build a garage, but he placed some of the excavated
material in the wetlands located a few acres east of the ditch. In addition, while he was digging
the ditch, small amounts of the soil and vegetation that he was removing from the wetlands
spilled out of the bucket of the backhoe into the wetlands that he was draining. After he
completed construction of the ditch, a consultant that he retained to delineate the wetlands on
the property indicated that there were only 30 acres of wetlands on the property, and that the
wetlands were located on the portion of the property situated east of the drainage ditch. Based
on that information, Jeremy cleared 10 acres of the western portion of the property that formerly
were wetlands, re-graded the area, incorporating several hundred cubic yards of dirt that he
purchased from the Minnesota Sand and Gravel Company, and built his new home on that
portion of the property. Jeremy did not obtain a Section 404 permit for any of his activities.
Should a permit have been required for (1) the construction of the drainage ditch; (2) the
placement of the excavated material in the wetlands east of the ditch; (3) the use of the
excavated materials to level the property for the garage; or (4) the placement of the dirt and
construction of the home on the western portion of the property?
Should a permit have been required for the construction of the drainage ditch if no soil or
vegetation spilled out of the backhoe bucket during the construction of the ditch?

E.
Competing Permitting Programs - 404 versus 402 - What is Fill Material?
As noted in Chapter 4, there are two permit programs in the Clean Water Act that regulate
the addition of pollutants into the navigable waters. EPA administers the Section 402 permit
program, which applies generally to point source discharges of pollutants into the navigable
waters, while the Corps administers the Section 404 permit program, which applies to
discharges of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters. More than 90% of the
activities regulated under the Section 404 permit program are authorized pursuant to
general permits and the Corps generally denies less than 1% of individual Section 404
permit applications. See Claudia Copeland, Wetlands: An Overview of Issues,
Congressional Research Service RL 33483 (July 12, 2010). Needless to say, EPA’s
Section 402 permit program is somewhat more demanding. Consequently, persons
engaging in activities that involve addition of pollutants into navigable waters have
frequently argued that, if their activities are regulated at all, they involve the discharge of fill
material and require a Section 404 permit rather than a Section 402 permit.
For many years, this issue was central to the controversy over the regulation of
mountaintop removal mining. Mountaintop removal mining is a surface mining practice that
involves removing the tops of mountains to expose coal seams that lie below the
mountaintops. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Mid-Atlantic Mountaintop
Mining, available at: http://www3.epa.gov/region03/mtntop/ To extract the coal, large
amounts of rock and soil (called “spoils”) are removed from the mountain. See Claudia
Copeland, Mountaintop Mining: Background on Current Controversies, Congressional
Research Service RS21421 (Dec. 2, 2013) [hereinafter “CRS Mountaintop Mining Report”]
Although the Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) requires
mining companies to return the spoils to the mined area to return the area to its
“approximate original contour” (AOC), 30 U.S.C. § 1265(b)(3), it is normally impossible to
do that with mountaintop removal mining because “broken rock takes up more volume than
did the rock prior to mining and because there are stability concerns with the spoil pile.”
CRS Mountaintop Mining Report, supra, at 1. SMCRA includes a provision that provides for
waiver of the AOC requirement in certain circumstances, though, see 30 U.S.C. §
1265(c)(3), and, as a result, the spoils from mountaintop removal are usually placed in
“valley fills” on the sides of the mountains, frequently burying streams in the valley below.
See CRS Mountaintop Mining Report, supra, at 1. The practice became very popular in the
Appalachian region of the United States in the 1990s. Id. Almost 1.2 million acres of land
have been surface mined in the Central Appalachian region and 500 mountains have been
severely impacted or destroyed by mountaintop mining in that region. See Appalachian
Voices, Mountaintop Removal 101.
Residents of the Appalachian region and environmentalists raised concerns about the
environmental impacts of mountaintop mining for years and, in a recent report, EPA
concluded that mountaintop removal mining and valley fills have the following impacts:

185

(1) springs, and ephemeral, intermittent streams, and small perennial streams are permanently
lost with the removal of the mountain and from burial under fill,
(2) concentrations of major chemical ions are persistently elevated downstream,
(3) degraded water quality reaches levels that are acutely lethal to standard laboratory test
organisms,
(4) selenium (Se) concentrations are elevated, reaching concentrations that have caused toxic
effects in fish and birds, and
(5) macroinvertebrate and fish communities are consistently and significantly degraded.

See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, The Effects of Mountaintop Mines and Valley
Fills on Aquatic Ecosystems of the Central Appalachian Coalfields 1 (EPA 600/R-09/138f)
(March 2011).
In the Clean Water Act context, residents of Appalachia and environmentalists argued that
the valley fills required Section 402 permits from EPA. The mining companies, on the other
hand, argued that the mining spoils that were being disposed of in the streams were “fill
material,” which could be authorized by the Corps of Engineers under Section 404.
As noted above, for many years, EPA and the Corps relied on different regulatory
definitions of “fill material.” The Corps’ 1977 regulation, which remained in place until 2002,
defined “fill material” as “any material used for the primary purpose of replacing an aquatic
area with dry land or of changing the bottom elevation of a waterbody. The term does not
include any pollutant discharged into the water primarily to dispose of waste, as that activity
is regulated under Section 402.“ See 42 Fed. Reg. 37,121, 37,145 (July 19, 1977). EPA’s
regulations, on the other hand, at least since 1980, have focused on whether materials
have the “effect” of replacing water with dry land or changing the bottom elevation of water,
regardless of the “purpose” of the placement of the material. See 45 Fed. Reg. 33290,
33421 (May 19, 1980). Pursuant to the Corps’ regulations, opponents of mountaintop
mining argued that the purpose of the valley fills was waste disposal, regulated by EPA
under Section 402, while the mining companies argued that the valley fills involved the
discharge of fill material and were regulated under Section 404. In the 1990s, when
mountaintop removal mining was becoming increasingly popular, the Corps authorized
most valley fills under a general permit, Nationwide Permit 21, instead of requiring mining
companies to obtain individual Section 404 permits. See 33 C.F.R. § 330.5(a)(21) (1992).
In 1998, several environmental groups and concerned citizens sued the Corps, arguing that
valley fills should be regulated by EPA under the Section 402 permit program, rather than
186

under Section 404. See Bragg v. Robertson, 54 F. Supp.2d. 635 (S.D. W.Va. 1999), aff’d in
part, vacated in part sub nom Bragg v. West Virginia Coal Ass’n, 248 F.3d 275 (4th Cir.
2001). The Fourth Circuit did not resolve the question of whether Section 402 or 404
applied to the valley fills, but the case did result in some changes to the federal regulation
of valley fills. Pursuant to a partial settlement agreement of the case, the Corps agreed to
require companies to obtain individual permits, rather than rely on the agency’s nationwide
permit, for many of the larger valley fills, and the Corps agreed to prepare an environmental
impact statement on mountaintop removal mining and valley fills. 54 F. Supp.2d at 639.
The Corps, along with EPA, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the West Virginia
Department of Environmental Protection, completed the final environmental impact
statement in 2005. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Final Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) on Mountaintop Mining/Valley Fills in Appalachia,
EPA 903-R-05-002 (Oct. 2005).
Although the Fourth Circuit, in Bragg, did not resolve the question of whether Section 402
or 404 applied to valley fills, the court was faced with the question again a few years later in
the following case. Prior to the court’s decision, the Corps began the process of amending
its regulations to adopt a definition of “fill material” that mirrored EPA’s definition and would
define material as “fill material” if it had the effect of replacing a water of the United States
with dry land or of changing the bottom elevation of a water of the United States. See 65
Fed. Reg. 21,292 (Apr. 20, 2000). In the proposal, EPA and the Corps indicated that, prior
to the proposal, the agencies generally agreed that valley fills would be regulated under
Section 404 and, while the proposal would change the Corps’ definition of “fill material,” it
would not change the division of authority between the agencies with regard to valley fills.
Id. at 21,295. However, the action challenged in the case was taken by the Corps under the
existing Corps’ regulations, which defined “fill material” in terms of the purpose for which
the material was used.

This appeal presents the issue of whether the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has authority
under the Clean Water Act and under its now-superseded 1977 regulation implementing
the Act to issue permits for valley fills in connection with mountaintop coal mining. It does
not present the question of whether mountaintop coal mining is useful, desirable, or wise.

injunctive relief to declare illegal the Corps' interpretation of the Clean Water Act and to
require the Corps to revoke the permit that it issued to Martin County Coal Corporation
under § 404 of the Act, authorizing Martin Coal to place excess overburden from one of its
coal mining projects into 27 valleys in Martin County, Kentucky.
On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court "found and concluded" that "fill
material" as used in § 404 referred only to "material deposited for some beneficial primary
purpose," not for waste disposal, and therefore that the Corps' "approval of waste disposal
as fill material under § 404 [of the Clean Water Act] [was] ultra vires" and "beyond the
authority" of the Corps. Because Martin Coal's assignee of the permit, Beech Fork
Processing, Inc., proposed "to re-engineer [the] existing mine plan to place no spoil in
waters of the United States without a constructive primary purpose," the court found there
to be no "imminent probable irreparable injury" to Kentuckians for the Commonwealth. The
court determined that in the absence of injury, Kentuckians' application for injunctive relief
with regard to the Martin Coal authorization "must be denied." But on the basis of its
conclusion that the Corps acts ultra vires whenever it issues permits for valley fills without a
beneficial primary purpose, the district court entered a purely prospective permanent
injunction against the Corps. This injunction prohibits the Corps from "issuing any further §
404 permits within the Huntington District [covering portions of five states] that have no
primary purpose or use but the disposal of waste," in particular, any permit to create valley
fills with the spoil of mountaintop coal mining for the sole purpose of waste disposal.
Because we conclude that the Corps' practice of issuing § 404 permits, including the permit
to Martin Coal, to create valley fills with the spoil of mountaintop coal mining is not ultra
vires under the Clean Water Act and that the injunction issued by the district court was
overbroad, we reverse the court's declaratory judgment; we vacate its injunction and the
memorandums and orders of May 8 and June 17, 2002; and we remand for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
I.
Martin County Coal Corporation ("Martin Coal"), having obtained a mining permit from the
Commonwealth of Kentucky in November 1999 to undertake a surface mining project in
Martin County, Kentucky, applied to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("the Corps") for
authorization under § 404 of the Clean Water Act and under the Corps' Nationwide Permit
21 ("NWP 21") "to construct hollow fills and sediment ponds in waters of the United States"
in connection with the proposed mining project. On June 20, 2000, the Corps "authorized"
Martin Coal's project, permitting it to place mining-operations "spoil" from "excess
overburden" in 27 valleys, filling about 6.3 miles of streams. "Overburden" is the soil and
rock that overlies a coal seam, and overburden that is excavated and removed is "spoil." In
connection with surface mining operations in mountains where the mine operator must
return the mountains to their approximate original contour, the spoil is placed temporarily in
188

valleys while the coal is removed from the seam and then returned to the mining location.
However, because spoil takes up more space than did the original overburden, all surface
mining creates excess spoil that must be placed somewhere. The permit in this case
authorized Martin Coal to create 27 valley fills with the excess spoil, which in turn would
bury some 6.3 miles of streams at the heads of the valleys.
The Corps' exercise of authority under NWP 21 to permit the creation of valley fills in
connection with mining operations was consistent with its past practices and with the
understanding of the Corps and the EPA as to how the Clean Water Act divides
responsibility for its administration. While court cases have, over the years, evinced
confusion over that division based on the agencies' differing approaches to defining "fill
material" in their regulations, see, e.g., Resource Investments, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of
Eng'rs, 151 F.3d 1162 (9th Cir.1998); Avoyelles Sportsmen's League v. Marsh, 715 F.2d
897 (5th Cir.1983), the Corps and the EPA have in fact exercised their authority
consistently in interpreting the Clean Water Act to give the Corps authority to issue permits
for the creation of valley fills in connection with surface coal mining activities.
At the time that the Corps issued its authorization to Martin Coal in this case, it had already
published notice, together with the EPA, of their intent to amend their regulations to resolve
ambiguities in both agencies' regulatory definitions of "fill material" and to clarify the division
of authority between the two agencies. As the Corps and the EPA stated in the public
notice of the intended amendments, issued on April 20, 2000:
With regard to proposed discharges of coal mining overburden, we believe that the
placement of such material into waters of the U.S. has the effect of fill and therefore,
should be regulated under CWA section 404. This approach is consistent with
existing practice and the existing EPA definition of the term "fill material." In
Appalachia in particular, such discharges typically result in the placement of rock
and other material in the heads of valleys, with a sedimentation pond located
downstream of this "valley fill." This has required authorization under CWA section
404 for the discharges of fill material into waters of the U.S., including the
overburden and coal refuse, as well as the berms, or dams, associated with the
sedimentation ponds. The effect of these discharges is to replace portions of a water
body with dry land. Therefore, today's proposal makes clear that such material is to
be regulated under CWA section 404.
65 Fed. Reg. 21,292, 21,295 (Apr. 20, 2000). This public notice also pointed out that the
EPA would, in connection with coal mining activities, continue to regulate "effluent
discharged into waters of the U.S. from sedimentation ponds," pursuant to § 402 of the
Clean Water Act. Id. at 21,296.
In August 2001, Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, Inc. ("Kentuckians"), commenced this
action against the Corps under the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA"), challenging the
189

Corps' action in issuing the June 20, 2000 permit to Martin Coal to create 27 valley fills and
to bury 6.3 miles of streams. * * * In support of their request for declaratory and injunctive
relief, Kentuckians alleged that the Corps had violated § 404 of the Clean Water Act as well
as its own regulations and had "acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of
discretion, and otherwise contrary to law, in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)."
Kentuckians asked the court to "[d]eclare that Defendants' June 20, 2000 decision granting
authorization under NWP 21 to [Martin Coal] is contrary to Section 404 of the CWA and its
implementing regulations ... in violation of the APA," and to "[i]ssue an order requiring
Defendants to revoke [Martin Coal's] authorization under NWP 21 or, in the alternative, to
suspend that authorization pending completion of EPA's Section 404(c) proceeding and/or
unless and until Defendants comply with their obligations herein under the APA, CWA, and
NEPA [National Environmental Policy Act]." * * *
[O]n May 8, 2002, the district court ruled on the pending cross-motions for summary
judgment, concluding that the efforts of the Corps and the EPA, as well as their past
applications of § 404, were inconsistent with the Clean Water Act. Kentuckians for the
Commonwealth, Inc. v. Rivenburgh, 204 F. Supp.2d 927 (S.D.W.Va.2002). The court
declared that "fill material" as used in § 404 of the Clean Water Act "refers to material
deposited for some beneficial primary purpose: for construction work, infrastructure,
improvement and development in waters of the United States, not waste material
discharged solely to dispose of waste." Accordingly, the court declared that the Corps'
"approval of a waste disposal as fill material under § 404 is ultra vires, that is, beyond the
authority of either [the Corps or the EPA]." * * *
Although the court refused to grant Kentuckians' motion for an injunction requiring the
Corps to revoke its permit to Martin Coal because Martin Coal's assignee was prepared to
reengineer the project so as not to create valley fills of waste material,* * * it issued a
permanent injunction against the Corps prohibiting it from issuing "any further § 404 permits
that have no primary purpose or use but the disposal of waste." As the court restated its
order, it enjoined the issuance of "mountaintop removal overburden valley fill permits solely
for waste disposal under § 404." The court did not, however, strike down the New Rule, as
no party had challenged it. But it declared the New Rule to be ultra vires: * * *
The district court issued a revised memorandum and order dated June 17, 2002, in which it
stated that the injunction did not have nationwide application; rather, it prohibited the Corps
from issuing § 404 permits "from their ordinary place of business, the Huntington District,"
which the court stated would have "substantial national impact" because 97% of "stream
length affected by valley fills in the nation" was approved in the Huntington District in 2000.
Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, Inc. v. Rivenburgh, 206 F. Supp.2d 782 (S.D.
W.Va.2002). The court also stated that the injunction did not enjoin the New Rule, 33
C.F.R. § 323.2 (2002). The court repeated, however, its declaration that the New Rule was
"inconsistent with the statutory scheme, and therefore ultra vires." * * *

190

[In Part II of the opinion, the court concluded that the injunction issued by the district court
was overbroad and the court vacated the injunction.]
III
[At the beginning of Part III of the opinion, the court discussed which parts of the district
court’s opinion were dicta and which parts would be reviewed on appeal.]
***
The judgment of the district court, as contained in its two orders of May 8 and June 17,
2002, and the positions of the parties thus bring us to the single question whether § 404 of
the Clean Water Act, in providing that the Corps "may issue permits... for the discharge of
dredged or fill material into navigable waters," authorizes the Corps to issue permits for the
creation of valley fills in connection with coal mining activities, when the valley fills serve no
purpose other than to dispose of excess overburden from the mining activity. This question
is presented particularly in Kentuckians' challenge of the Corps' action in issuing the permit
to Martin Coal.
B
When reviewing a particular agency action challenged under § 706(2) of the APA, "[t]he
court is first required to decide whether the [agency] acted within the scope of [its]
authority." Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402 (1971). The first
step in this analysis is an examination of the statute providing authority for the agency to
act. As the Supreme Court explained in NationsBank of North Carolina, N.A. v. Variable
Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 257 (1995):
[W]hen we confront an expert administrator's statutory exposition, we inquire first
whether "the intent of Congress is clear" as to "the precise question at issue."
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842
(1984). If so, "that is the end of the matter" Ibid. But "if the statute is silent or
ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether
the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." Id. at
843. If the administrator's reading fills a gap or defines a term in a way that is
reasonable in light of the legislature's revealed design, we give the administrator's
judgment "controlling weight." Id. at 844.
This analytical approach applies not only when a regulation is directly challenged, as in
Chevron, but also when a particular agency action is challenged, as in NationsBank.
Moreover, when an agency acts pursuant to a regulation, a reviewing court must, if there is
any dispute about the meaning of the regulation, interpret the meaning of the regulation to
191

determine whether the agency's action is consistent with the regulation. The reviewing
court does not have much leeway in undertaking this interpretation, however, because the
agency is entitled to interpret its own regulation and the agency's interpretation is
"controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation." Auer v. Robbins,
519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This requirement
of binding deference to agency interpretations of their own regulations, unless "plainly
erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation," is known as Seminole Rock deference,
having first been articulated in Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 414
(1945).
Finally, if there is any question whether an agency action taken pursuant to a regulation
exceeds the agency's statutory authority, the statutory inquiry under Chevron step one
(whether the intent of Congress is clear) must take place prior to interpreting the agency's
own regulation. This ordering is a function of the Chevron test itself: If Congress has
spoken clearly to the issue, then the regulation is inapplicable. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.
Echazabal, 536 U.S. 73 (2002) (applying an analytical approach by which the validity of an
action taken in reliance a regulation depends, in the first instance, on whether the
regulation itself exceeds the issuing agency's statutory authority); see also John F.
Manning, Constitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency Interpretations of
Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612, 627 n.78 (1996) ("It is important to note that
because a regulation must be consistent with the statute it implements, any interpretation of
a regulation naturally must accord with the statute as well.... [T]o get to Seminole Rock
deference, a court must first address the straightforward Chevron question whether an
agency regulation, as interpreted, violates the statute. Seminole Rock addresses the further
question whether the agency's interpretation is consistent with the regulation").
C
In this case the Corps contends that "[t]he district court erred as a matter of law in holding
that the Corps lacks authority under CWA Section 404 to regulate as `fill material' the
discharge of excess spoil from surface coal mining into waters of the United States." * * * It
notes that Congress did not define "fill material" and left that to the agencies charged with
administering § 404. It concludes that the practice followed by it and by the EPA over the
years is "a permissible one entitled to deference" under Chevron. It claims that the new
dual-agency construction in the New Rule reflects the agencies' past practices and "falls
easily within the most obvious reading of the term `fill material,'" and is consistent with the
statutory scheme and purposes of the Clean Water Act.
***
Kentuckians contends that "[t]he district court correctly held that the Corps lacks authority
under § 404 of the Clean Water Act to allow the filling of waters of the United States solely
for waste disposal," but Kentuckians asserts that it "reaches that conclusion on grounds
192

that differ, in part, from those relied on by the district court." Although Kentuckians agrees
that "fill material" has not been defined in the Clean Water Act, it argues that Congress'
intent is clear from the context of the Clean Water Act and that Congress did not mean for
any provision of the Act to permit the Corps to "evade the water quality standards"
mandated by the Act. Kentuckians asserts that to construe "fill material" in any way other
than that given by the district court would violate the clear intent of the Clean Water Act "to
restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the nation's waters."
33 U.S.C. § 1251(a). Kentuckians contends alternatively that even if the Act is ambiguous,
the Corps' interpretation is unreasonable and impermissible because "[e]vasion of a
statute's core mandate and purpose can scarcely be considered a `reasonable'
interpretation." Finally, Kentuckians asserts that the Corps' interpretation is internally
inconsistent because the Corps' construction gives it authority over "mining waste, but
excludes trash and garbage." It argues that such a construction produces an absurd result
because the burial of a stream by mining waste is "much more devastating" than
degradation of water by trash or garbage.
As with any issue of statutory interpretation, we begin with the language of the statute. If
congressional intent is clear from application of "traditional tools of statutory construction,"
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. FDA, 153 F.3d 155, 161 (4th Cir.1998), aff'd, 529
U.S. 120 (2000), "that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must
give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress," Chevron, 467 U.S. at 84243. "[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for
the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the
statute." Id. at 843.
Because the Clean Water Act does not define "fill material," nor does it suggest on its face
the limitation of "fill material" found by the district court, the statute is silent on the issue
before us, and such silence "normally creates ambiguity. It does not resolve it." Barnhart v.
Walton, 535 U.S. 212 (2002); see also Piney Run Preservation Ass'n v. County Comm'rs,
268 F.3d 255, 267 (4th Cir.2001) * * *
The district court concluded, however, that its facial interpretation -- that a permit issued
under § 404 can only authorize the discharge of fill material into navigable waters "for some
beneficial primary purpose... not waste material discharged solely to dispose of waste" -was supported by § 404(f)(2) of the Clean Water Act, by the Act's succession to the Rivers
and Harbors Act, and by the Act's relation to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act ("SMCRA"). We examine each of these to determine whether any unambiguously
indicates a clear congressional intent with respect to the definition of "fill material" as used
in § 404(a). * * *
[The court then examined, and rejected, each of those findings of the district court and
disagreed with the district court’s conclusion that the statutory language was clear.]

193

The district court’s application of traditional tools of statutory construction thus could not
leave it with a clear congressional intent that the undefined term “fill material” as used in §
404 means material deposited for a beneficial primary purpose. Indeed, the lack of clarity
in the term itself prompted the agencies to undertake efforts to develop the term’s meaning
from the context of the permit programs and the interrelationship between § 402 permits
and § 404 permits. While the statute authorizes the EPA to issue permits “for the discharge
of any pollutant,” defining “pollutant” to include “rock, sand, dirt and industrial, municipal
and agricultural waste,” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(6), the EPA is not authorized to issue a permit for
“fill material,” 33 U.S.C. § 1342(a)(1). Yet, when a permit is issued by the Corps under §
404 for the discharge of fill material that has a substantive adverse effect on municipal
waters, fish, and wildlife, the EPA can veto the Corps’ permit. 33 U.S.C. §1344 (c). The
statute’s silence on the definition of “fill material” thus gives rise to ambiguity, particularly
when a broad definition of “fill material” is employed.
Based on our de novo review of whether Congress has spoken clearly on the meaning of
"fill material," see Holland v. Pardee Coal Co., 269 F.3d 424, 430 (4th Cir. 2001) (holding
that an issue of statutory construction is a "pure question of law" subject to de novo review),
we conclude that Congress has not clearly spoken on the meaning of "fill material" and, in
particular, has not clearly defined "fill material to be material deposited for some beneficial
primary purpose." Accordingly, we proceed into Chevron step-two analysis to determine
whether the Corps' action is based on a permissible construction of § 404. See Capitol
Mortgage Bankers, Inc. v. Cuomo, 222 F.3d 151, 155 (4th Cir.2000) (determining that the
district court's Chevron step-one holding was incorrect and stating that "[w]e must therefore
proceed to the second step of the Chevron analysis and consider, with deference to [the
agency's] expertise in this area, whether the agency's interpretation of the statute ... is
based on a permissible construction of the statute").
D
Although the district court rested its holding principally on a statutory interpretation of the
Clean Water Act under Chevron step one, concluding that "§ 404 is neither silent nor
ambiguous on the issue of § 404 fills and their purposes," it addressed alternatively, albeit
conclusorily, the reasonableness of the Corps' interpretation of the statute under Chevron
step two. The court stated that its "examination of the legislative and regulatory history,
interagency agreements, and related statutes demonstrates any interpretation of § 404 fill
material that ignores and deliberately eliminates the primary purpose test for fill
authorization is contrary to the purpose, principles, and policy of the CWA. [Citation
omitted]. Such an agency interpretation is not permissible." The court thus reiterated the
conclusion it reached in its Chevron step-one analysis, and its Chevron step-two analysis
did not give any deference to the agency's interpretation of this regulation nor did it explain
why such deference would be inappropriate.
Because the agency action at issue in this case was taken at a time when the Corps' 1977
194

Regulation was in effect, the appropriate inquiry under Chevron step two is whether that
regulation, as interpreted by the Corps, is based on a permissible reading of the Clean
Water Act, and, if so, whether the agency acted consistently with the regulation in issuing a
permit to Mountain Coal to create valley fills in connection with coal mining activities.
The Corps' 1977 Regulation defines "fill material" as "any material used for the primary
purpose of replacing an aquatic area with dry land or of changing the bottom elevation of
a[] waterbody." 33 C.F.R. 323.2(e) (2001). The regulation provides further that "[t]he term
does not include any pollutant discharged into the water primarily to dispose of waste, as
that activity is regulated under section 402 of the Clean Water Act." Id. At the time when
this 1977 Regulation was promulgated, the Corps, explaining the "waste" exclusion, stated
that in its experience:
several industrial and municipal discharges of solid waste materials have been
brought to our attention which technically fit within our definition of "fill material" but
which are intended to be regulated under the NPDES program [i.e., the EPA's
program created under § 402]. These include the disposal of waste materials such
as sludge, garbage, trash, and debris in water.
***
The Corps and the Environmental Protection Agency feel that the initial decision
relating to this type of discharge should be through the NPDES program.
42 Fed. Reg. 37,122, 37,130 (July 19, 1977).
To demonstrate that the Corps' understanding of its authority to issue permits for valley fills
was based on a longstanding division of authority between the Corps and the EPA that
reflected the interpretations of both agencies with regard to their respective regulatory
authority under the Clean Water Act, the Corps submitted to the district court over 120
pages of correspondence with the EPA and with regulated parties addressing valley fill
permits issued under Section 404. This correspondence, which spans approximately ten
years from 1990 through 2000, includes actual permit grants, EPA objections to Corps
actions, and evaluations by the Corps and the EPA of mitigation plans. To the extent that
this correspondence reveals any disputes about the Corps' exercise of its permitting
authority, these disputes focus on whether the impact of a particular valley fill would be
more than minimal, thus requiring the issuance of an individual permit rather than
authorization under a nationwide permit. The basic division of authority, including the
Corps' authority to issue valley fill permits, is apparent throughout this record of both
agencies' practices. The Corps also submitted the affidavit of Michael B. Cook, the director
of EPA's Office of Wastewater Management in Washington, D.C. since 1991. According to
Mr. Cook:

195

While the effluent guidelines address certain discharges of pollutants associated
with coal mining operations (e.g., coal preparation plants and mine drainage), the
regulations do not address discharges of soil, rock and vegetation (i.e., overburden)
that is excavated in order to access coal reserves and then placed in waters of the
United States, as in the case of valley fills. To our knowledge, such discharges
have only been authorized by permits issued under section 404 of the CWA by the
Army Corps of Engineers.
In short, the evidence submitted to the district court revealed a longstanding and consistent
division of authority between the Corps and the EPA with regard to the issuance of permits
under CWA Section 402 and CWA Section 404.
Moreover, when the Corps issued the permit to Martin Coal on June 20, 2000, it continued
to operate with an understanding that it was authorized to regulate discharges of fill, even
for waste, unless the fill amounted to effluent that could be subjected to effluent limitations.
It certainly did not interpret its own 1977 Regulation to impose a beneficial primary purpose
requirement. This is evidenced by its public notice given on April 17, 2000, two months
prior to the issuance of the permit at issue in this action, when the Corps joined with the
EPA to propose a joint rule that would "not alter current practice," but rather was "intended
to clarify what constitutes `fill material' subject to CWA section 404." 65 Fed. Reg. at
21,292. The Corps and the EPA recognized that some courts had interpreted the Corps'
regulation to impose a primary-purpose test applied without regard to the traditional division
of authority between the Corps and the EPA, and that the ambiguities of this test had
caused confusion. As one specific example of this confusion, the Corps and the EPA
pointed to dicta in an opinion issued by the district court in an earlier valley-fill case in which
the district court determined that "the Corps lacked authority to regulate under CWA section
404 the placement into waters of the U.S. of rock, sand, and earth overburden from coal
surface mining operations, because the `primary purpose' of the discharge was waste
disposal." Id. at 21,295. Disclaiming any interpretation of the Corps' 1977 Regulation that
would strip the Corps of authority to issue § 404 permits for valley fills, the Corps and the
EPA described what they understood the appropriate division of labor to be:
The section 402 program is focused on (although not limited to) discharges such as
wastewater discharges from industrial operations and sewage treatment plants,
stormwater and the like.... Pollutant discharges are controlled under the section 402
program principally through the imposition of effluent limitations, which are
restrictions on the "quantities, rates, and concentrations of chemical, physical,
biological and other constituents which are discharged from point sources into
navigable waters".... There are no statutory or regulatory provisions under the
section 402 program designed to address discharges that convert waters of the U.S.
to dry land.
***
196

[S]ection 404 focuses exclusively on two materials: dredged material and fill
material. The term "fill material" clearly contemplates material that fills in a water
body, and thereby converts it to dry land or changes the bottom elevation. Fill
material differs fundamentally from the types of pollutants covered by section 402
because the principal environmental concern is the loss of a portion of the water
body itself. For this reason, the section 404 permitting process focuses on different
considerations than the section 402 permitting program.
Id. at 21,293.
This contemporaneous explanation by the two agencies charged with the responsibility of
administering the Clean Water Act provides a rational interpretation of the 1977 Regulation
that is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the text of the regulation. The 1977
Regulation seeks to divide the statutory responsibilities between the agencies charged with
different responsibilities by defining "fill material" that is subject to regulation by the Corps
and "waste" that is subject to regulation by the EPA through the administration of effluent
limitations. Moreover, the resolution among agencies of the line dividing their
responsibilities is just the type of agency action to which the courts must defer. See
Echazabal, 122 S. Ct. at 2052 (noting that the EEOC's resolution of a tension between the
Americans with Disabilities Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act "exemplifies
the substantive choices that agencies are expected to make when Congress leaves the
intersection of competing objectives both imprecisely marked and subject to administrative
leeway").
A reviewing court can set aside the agency's interpretation of its own regulation only if that
interpretation is "plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation." Auer, 519 U.S. at
461 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). When we examine the Corps' 1977
Regulation and its interpretations of that regulation, we conclude that the Corps'
interpretations of the 1977 Regulation -- made both by interpretations published in the
Federal Register and by its application of that regulation in issuing permits -- were neither
plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the text of the regulation.
We next determine whether the 1977 Regulation itself, as construed by both the Corps and
the EPA, was also a permissible reading of the Clean Water Act.
The stated goal of the Clean Water Act is "to restore and maintain the chemical, physical,
and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a). To that end, the Clean
Water Act prohibits discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States, except in
compliance with a permit issued by one of the permit regimes established by the Act. 33
U.S.C. § 1311(a). Two principal regimes are created in §§ 402 and 404 of the Act. Section
402 creates a permit program under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, a
combination of State and EPA regulatory activities that is administered by the EPA. Section
197

404 creates a permit program administered by the Corps, authorizing the Corps to issue
permits only in connection with the "discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable
waters at specified disposal sites." 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a). The two sections are linked by
cross-references, exclusions, and vetoes. Section 402 authorizes the EPA to issue permits
for the discharge of any pollutant or combination of pollutants, except as provided in § 404.
And § 404 in turn provides that the Corps may issue permits for the limited discharges
relating to dredged or fill material, providing that the Corps' permits are always subject to
the veto power of the EPA when the dredged or fill material would have "an unacceptable
adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas ... wildlife, or
recreational areas." 33 U.S.C. § 1344(c). Thus, a § 404 permit is always subject to the
EPA's determination that a discharge will have an "unacceptable adverse effect" on certain
specified waters, reinforcing the fill-effluent distinction that has been followed by the
agencies.
Because the Clean Water Act clearly intended to divide functions between the Corps and
the EPA based on the type of discharge involved, we conclude that it was consistent with
the Act for the Corps to have adopted its 1977 Regulation defining "fill material" to be
any material used for the primary purpose of replacing an aquatic area with dry land
or of changing the bottom elevation of a water body. The term does not include any
pollutant discharged into the water primarily to dispose of waste, as that activity is
regulated under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act.
33 C.F.R. § 323.2(e) (2001). The first sentence of this regulation adopts an inclusive test
that focuses on the purposeful displacement of water with solid material. The second
sentence provides, as construed by the agencies, an exclusion which defers to the EPA's
authority to regulate "waste." Because it was not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the
regulation for the Corps to have asserted that its use of the term "waste" in the 1977
Regulation was not intended to defer to the EPA on all material deposited for disposal, as
we have already concluded, we read the 1977 Regulation to include that interpretation and,
as so interpreted, conclude that the 1977 Regulation was a rational interpretation of the
Clean Water Act. Section 404 confers on the Corps all responsibility to issue permits for the
discharges of "fill material," but it gives the EPA a veto when those discharges might
adversely affect the quality of certain waters. Section 402 confers on the EPA
responsibility to regulate the discharge of pollutants into waters under mechanisms to
administer effluent limitations. The two authorizations might overlap on certain types of "fill
material" that adversely affect the quality of water, and the 1977 Regulation, as interpreted
by the Corps, reasonably addresses this potential ambiguity.
In sum, we conclude that the Corps' interpretation of "fill material" as used in § 404 of the
Clean Water Act to mean all material that displaces water or changes the bottom elevation
of a water body except for "waste" -- meaning garbage, sewage, and effluent that could be
regulated by ongoing effluent limitations as described in § 402 -- is a permissible
198

construction of § 404. And as an interpretation of its 1977 Regulation, it is neither plainly
erroneous nor inconsistent with the text of the regulation.
The Corps' issuance of the permit to Martin Coal on June 20, 2000, therefore, was not
arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law insofar as
Kentuckians alleged in Count I of the complaint. On this issue, we reverse the judgment of
the district court.
Questions and Comments
1.

This case involved a question of whether the 1977 Corps regulatory definition of “fill
material” was authorized by the Clean Water Act and whether the Corps’
interpretation of that regulation was appropriate. As in the Supreme Court’s
Riverside Bayview Homes case, the Fourth Circuit noted, in this case, that the
Chevron analysis applied to the first question, while the Auer analysis applied to the
second question. The order in which the court addressed those questions, though, is
a bit unorthodox. The court begins the opinion with a focus on Chevron step 1,
moves to Auer, then returns to Chevron step 2. Why might the court have structured
the opinion in that manner?

2.

Chevron: Although the district court determined that the Clean Water Act was clear
and did not authorize the Corps to regulate valley fills as “fill material,” the appellate
court concluded that the statute is ambiguous, so the agency’s interpretation is
entitled to deference at Chevron step 2. At Chevron step 1, the appellate court
seems to focus solely on the text of the statute to find that the Clean Water Act is
ambiguous with regard to whether “fill material” means “material deposited for some
primary beneficial purpose.” On what basis, then, does it conclude, at Chevron step
2, that the Corps’ interpretation of the statute (rather than the regulation) is
reasonable? Has the court set the Chevron bar very high?

3.

Kentuckians for the Commonwealth argued that permits issued under Section 402 of
the Clean Water Act incorporate standards to protect water quality that are not
included in Section 404 permits, and that the Corps could not define “fill material” in
a way that would include valley fills because such a regulation would evade the
implementation of those standards and violate the water quality protection purposes
of the statute. Does the appellate court address that argument or focus on those
purposes of the statute in interpreting it? A regulation that defined “fill material” to be
limited to materials primarily used for a beneficial purpose would seem to advance
that purpose.

4.

Auer: When will an agency’s interpretation of its regulations be “plainly erroneous or
inconsistent with the regulation” under Auer? The Corps’ regulations provided that
“fill material” “does not include any pollutant discharged into the water primarily to
199

dispose of waste.” Regardless of the long-standing nature of the Corps and EPA’s
interpretation of the Corps’ regulation, is there any purpose for the disposal of the
mining spoils in the valley other than waste disposal?
5.

The district court also concluded that the rule that the Corps proposed in 2000 to
redefine “fill material” (the “new rule”) was outside of the agency’s authority. Why do
you think that the appellate court vacated that determination without much
discussion?

6.

After the case was decided, the Corps finalized the “new rule” mentioned in the case
and adopted EPA’s definition of “fill material,” which is based on the “effect” of the
placement of material, rather than its purpose. See 33 C.F.R. §323.2. Under the
new regulation, it is certainly easier to argue that “valley fills” have the “effect” of
changing the bottom elevation of waters of the United States or replacing a portion
of the waters of the United States with dry land, regardless of their purpose. Thus,
the Corps’ interpretation of the new rule would clearly seem to be entitled to Auer
deference. Could the new rule still be challenged as beyond the Corps’ statutory
authority, though? Would such a challenge likely be successful in the Fourth Circuit?

7.

Scope of Injunction: The injunction issued by the district court was a regional
injunction, rather than a national injunction. Note, however, that the appellate court
pointed out that activities authorized by one district office of the Corps of Engineers
in Kentucky accounted for 97% of the stream length affected by valley fills in the
nation in 2000.

8.

Environmental Justice: Note that the plaintiff, Kentuckians for the Commonwealth,
is described in the opinion as “a nonprofit corporation formed to promote ‘social
justice and quality of life for all Kentuckians.” Numerous studies over several
decades have demonstrated that low income and minority communities are
disparately impacted by pollution. See Stephen M. Johnson, Economics v. Equity:
Do Market-Based Environmental Reforms Exacerbate Environmental Injustice?, 56
Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 111, 117 (1999). The mountaintop removal mining issue is
another example of this trend. See Patrick McGinley, Collateral Damage: Turning a
Blind Eye to Environmental and Social Injustice in the Coalfields, 19 J. Envtl. &
Sustainability L. 305 (2013). The Appalachia region, where most mountaintop
removal mining takes place, is one of the poorest regions in the country. See e.g.
Appalachian Regional Commission, Economic Overview of Appalachia - 2011 (per
capita income in Appalachia is 18% lower than the national average). As Professor
Patrick McGinley notes, “After a century of mining in the ‘billion dollar coalfields’,
local communities lack funds to upgrade aging schools, tens of thousands live below
the federal ‘poverty line’; and public services such as fire, police, sewage treatment,
and libraries struggle to survive . . .” Patrick C. McGinley, From Pick & Shovel to
Mountaintop Removal: Environmental Injustice in the Appalachian Coalfields, 34
200

Envir. L. 21, 23 (2004). Because of the implementation of new technologies and
practices like mountaintop removal mining, mining employment decreased in
Kentucky by two thirds between 1980 and 2006, although production from the mines
decreased only slightly. See Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, How Does
Mountaintop Removal Affect the Economy? Perhaps these factors played some role
in the court’s statement at the outset of the opinion that the case “does not present
the question of whether mountaintop coal mining is useful, desirable, or wise.”

Post-Script: After another Fourth Circuit ruling in 2009, Ohio Valley Environmental
Coalition v. Aracoma Coal Company, 556 F.3d 1777 (4th Cir. 2009), in which the
court rejected challenges that the Corps violated the National Environmental Policy
Act and acted arbitrarily in approving four valley fill permits, EPA announced that it
would review all pending surface coal mining permit requests in Appalachia
pursuant to its authority under Section 404 to review and comment on permits
issued by the Corps. In June, 2009, EPA, the Corps and the Department of Interior
signed a Memorandum of Understanding that established a series of actions to
reduce the environmental impacts of mountaintop mining. See Memorandum of
Understanding among the U.S. Department of the Army, U.S. Department of the
Interior, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Implementing the Interagency
Action Plan on Appalachian Surface Coal Mining (June 11, 2009). As part of the
action plan in that MOU, EPA and the Corps began using an Enhanced
Coordination Procedure (“ECP”) for evaluating 79 coal mining permits that EPA
identified for additional environmental review. See CRS Mountaintop Mining Report,
supra at 6. Coal companies complained that the process significantly delayed permit
decisions and they challenged the ECP in court. In National Mining Association v.
Jackson, 816 F. Supp. 2d 37 (D.D.C. 2011), the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia held that the ECP unlawfully transferred Clean Water act
authority from the Corps to EPA. Although the court set aside the ECP, EPA and the
Corps subsequently issued memoranda to the field reminding staff that the agencies
should coordinate their review of mining permits in accordance with existing agency
regulations. See Nancy Stoner, Acting Assistant Administrator, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Office of Water, Transmittal of Department of the Army Memo on
“Decision in National Mining Association et al. v. Jackson, et al”. The D.C. Circuit
later overturned the decision of the district court and upheld the ECP. See National
Mining Association v. McCarthy, No. 12-5310 (D.C. Cir. July 11, 2014). EPA’s role in
the 404 permitting process is discussed in detail in Chapter 6 of this book.
In addition to the litigation discussed above, mountaintop removal mining has
spurred litigation focusing on the appropriate scope of coverage of nationwide
201

permits and EPA’s authority to veto Section 404 permits. Those cases, and the
underlying controversies, will be explored in detail in Chapters 6 (Permits) and 8
(EPA Vetoes).
11.

Landfills: When the Corps amended its regulatory definition of fill material, it
included a non-exclusive list of materials that met the definition (rock, sand, soil,
clay, plastics, construction debris, wood chips, overburden from mining or other
excavation activities, and materials used to create any structure or infrastructure in
the waters of the United States) and specifically provided that the term “does not
include trash or garbage.” See 33 C.F.R. §323.2. In addition, in the preamble to the
rule, the agency indicated that fill material used to create liners, berms and other
infrastructure associated with solid waste landfills would be regulated as fill material
under Section 404, rather than under section 402. See 67 Fed. Reg. 31129, 31134
(May 9, 2002).

While there has been significant litigation surrounding mountaintop removal mining, more
traditional mining activities have also spawned Section 404 litigation. In 2004, Coeur Mining
sought to reopen the Kensington Mine, located near the Tongass National Forest in Alaska,
which had ceased operations in 1928. As noted above, EPA and the Corps regulate the
disposal of a variety of types of mining waste as the “discharge of fill material,” requiring a
Section 404 permit rather than a Section 402 permit. Accordingly, Coeur Mining sought,
and received, a Section 404 permit from the Corps of Engineers that authorized the
disposal of mining waste from the Kensington Mine in the Lower Slate Lake in Alaska. As
noted above, when EPA issues Section 402 permits, the permits often include limits on
pollution discharges based on technology-based and water quality based standards. Those
202

limits are not included in Section 404 permits that the Corps issues. The controversy arose
in the Kensington Mine case because EPA had developed technology-based pollution limits
that would have significantly limited or precluded Coeur from disposing of its mining waste
in the Lower Slate Lake if Coeur were required to obtain a Section 402 permit. However,
since Coeur was not required to obtain a Section 402 permit, the EPA standards did not
apply to Coeur’s disposal of waste in the Lake, but did apply to any pollution that was
released from the Lake. The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, a local environmental
group, challenged the permit, arguing that the Corps lacked authority under the Clean
Water Act to issue the Section 404 permit and that the permit should have been issued by
EPA under Section 402.

These cases require us to address two questions under the Clean Water Act (CWA or Act).
The first is whether the Act gives authority to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, or
instead to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to issue a permit for the discharge
of mining waste, called slurry. The Corps of Engineers has issued a permit to petitioner
Coeur Alaska, Inc. (Coeur Alaska), for a discharge of slurry into a lake in Southeast Alaska.
The second question is whether, when the Corps issued that permit, the agency acted in
accordance with law. We conclude that the Corps was the appropriate agency to issue the
permit and that the permit is lawful.
With regard to the first question, § 404(a) of the CWA grants the Corps the power to “issue
permits … for the discharge of … fill material.” 86 Stat. 884; 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a). But the
EPA also has authority to issue permits for the discharge of pollutants. Section 402 of the
Act grants the EPA authority to “issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant” “[e]xcept
as provided in” §404. 33 U.S.C. § 1342(a). We conclude that because the slurry Coeur
Alaska wishes to discharge is defined by regulation as “fill material,” 40 C.F.R. § 232.2
(2008), Coeur Alaska properly obtained its permit from the Corps of Engineers, under §
404, rather than from the EPA, under § 402.
The second question is whether the Corps permit is lawful. Three environmental groups,
respondents here, sued the Corps under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that the
issuance of the permit by the Corps was “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. §
706(2)(A). The environmental groups are Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, Sierra
Club, and Lynn Canal Conservation (collectively, SEACC). The State of Alaska and Coeur
Alaska are petitioners here.
SEACC argues that the permit from the Corps is unlawful because the discharge of slurry
204

would violate an EPA regulation promulgated under § 306(b) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. §
1316(b). The EPA regulation, which is called a “new source performance standard,” forbids
mines like Coeur Alaska’s from discharging “process wastewater” into the navigable waters.
40 C.F.R. § 440.104(b)(1). Coeur Alaska, the State of Alaska, and the federal agencies
maintain that the Corps permit is lawful nonetheless because the EPA’s performance
standard does not apply to discharges of fill material.
Reversing the judgment of the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that the EPA’s
performance standard applies to this discharge so that the permit from the Corps is
unlawful.
I
A
Petitioner Coeur Alaska plans to reopen the Kensington Gold Mine, located some 45 miles
north of Juneau, Alaska. The mine has been closed since 1928, but Coeur Alaska seeks to
make it profitable once more by using a technique known as “froth flotation.” Coeur Alaska
will churn the mine’s crushed rock in tanks of frothing water. Chemicals in the water will
cause gold-bearing minerals to float to the surface, where they will be skimmed off.
At issue is Coeur Alaska’s plan to dispose of the mixture of crushed rock and water left
behind in the tanks. This mixture is called slurry. Some 30 percent of the slurry’s volume is
crushed rock, resembling wet sand, which is called tailings. The rest is water.
The standard way to dispose of slurry is to pump it into a tailings pond. The slurry
separates in the pond. Solid tailings sink to the bottom, and water on the surface returns to
the mine to be used again.
Rather than build a tailings pond, Coeur Alaska proposes to use Lower Slate Lake, located
some three miles from the mine in the Tongass National Forest. This lake is small — 800
feet at its widest crossing, 2,000 feet at its longest, and 23 acres in area. See App. 138a,
212a. Though small, the lake is 51 feet deep at its maximum. The parties agree the lake is
a navigable water of the United States and so is subject to the CWA. They also agree
there can be no discharge into the lake except as the CWA and any lawful permit allow.
Over the life of the mine, Coeur Alaska intends to put 4.5 million tons of tailings in the lake.
This will raise the lakebed 50 feet — to what is now the lake’s surface — and will increase
the lake’s area from 23 to about 60 acres. Id., at 361a (62 acres), 212a (56 acres). To
contain this wider, shallower body of water, Coeur Alaska will dam the lake’s downstream
shore. The transformed lake will be isolated from other surface water. Creeks and
stormwater runoff will detour around it. Id., at 298a. Ultimately, lakewater will be cleaned by
purification systems and will flow from the lake to a stream and thence onward. Id., at
309a–312a.
205

B
Numerous state and federal agencies reviewed and approved Coeur Alaska’s plans. At
issue here are actions by two of those agencies: the Corps of Engineers and the EPA.
1
The CWA classifies crushed rock as a “pollutant.” 33 U.S.C. § 1362(6). On the one hand,
the Act forbids Coeur Alaska’s discharge of crushed rock “[e]xcept as in compliance” with
the Act. CWA §301(a), 33 U.S.C. §1311(a). Section 404(a) of the CWA, on the other hand,
empowers the Corps to authorize the discharge of “dredged or fill material.” 33 U.S.C. §
1344(a). The Corps and the EPA have together defined “fill material” to mean any “material
[that] has the effect of … [c]hanging the bottom elevation” of water. 40 C.F.R. §232.2. The
agencies have further defined the “discharge of fill material” to include “placement of …
slurry, or tailings or similar mining-related materials.” Ibid.
In these cases the Corps and the EPA agree that the slurry meets their regulatory definition
of “fill material.” On that premise the Corps evaluated the mine’s plan for a § 404 permit.
After considering the environmental factors required by §404(b), the Corp issued Coeur
Alaska a permit to pump the slurry into Lower Slate Lake. App. 340a–378a.
In granting the permit the Corps followed the steps set forth by § 404. Section 404(b)
requires the Corps to consider the environmental consequences of every discharge it
allows. 33 U.S.C. § 1344(b). The Corps must apply guidelines written by the EPA pursuant
to §404(b). See ibid.; 40 C.F.R. pt. 230 (EPA guidelines). Applying those guidelines here,
the Corps determined that Coeur Alaska’s plan to use Lower Slate Lake as a tailings pond
was the “least environmentally damaging practicable” way to dispose of the tailings. App.
366a. To conduct that analysis, the Corps compared the plan to the proposed alternatives.
The Corps determined that the environmental damage caused by placing slurry in the lake
will be temporary. And during that temporary disruption, Coeur Alaska will divert waters
around the lake through pipelines built for this purpose. Id., at 298a. Coeur Alaska will also
treat water flowing from the lake into downstream waters, pursuant to strict EPA criteria.
Ibid.; see Part I–B–2, infra. Though the slurry will at first destroy the lake’s small population
of common fish, that population may later be replaced. After mining operations are
completed, Coeur Alaska will help “recla[im]” the lake by “[c]apping” the tailings with about
4 inches of “native material.” App. 361a; id., at 309a. The Corps concluded that
“[t]he reclamation of the lake will result in more emergent wetlands/vegetated
shallows with moderate values for fish habitat, nutrient recycling, carbon/detrital
export and sediment/toxicant retention, and high values for wildlife habitat.” Id., at
361a.
206

If the tailings did not go into the lake, they would be placed on nearby wetlands. The
resulting pile would rise twice as high as the Pentagon and cover three times as many
acres. Reply Brief for Petitioner Coeur Alaska 27. If it were chosen, that alternative would
destroy dozens of acres of wetlands—a permanent loss. App. 365a–366a. On the premise
that when the mining ends the lake will be at least as environmentally hospitable, if not
more so, than now, the Corps concluded that placing the tailings in the lake will cause less
damage to the environment than storing them above ground: The reclaimed lake will be
“more valuable to the aquatic ecosystem than a permanently filled wetland … that has lost
all aquatic functions and values.” Id., at 361a; see also id., at 366a.
2
The EPA had the statutory authority to veto the Corps permit, and prohibit the discharge, if
it found the plan to have “an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies,
shellfish beds and fishery areas … , wildlife, or recreational areas.” CWA § 404(c), 33
U.S.C. § 1344(c). After considering the Corps findings, the EPA did not veto the Corps
permit, even though, in its view, placing the tailings in the lake was not the “environmentally
preferable” means of disposing of them. App. 300a. By declining to exercise its veto, the
EPA in effect deferred to the judgment of the Corps on this point.
The EPA’s involvement extended beyond the agency’s veto consideration. The EPA also
issued a permit of its own—not for the discharge from the mine into the lake but for the
discharge from the lake into a downstream creek. Id., at 287a–331a. Section 402 grants
the EPA authority to “issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant,” “[e]xcept as
provided in [CWA § 404].” 33 U.S.C. § 1342(a). The EPA’s §402 permit authorizes Coeur
Alaska to discharge water from Lower Slate Lake into the downstream creek, subject to
strict water-quality limits that Coeur Alaska must regularly monitor. App. 303a–304a, 309a.
The EPA’s authority to regulate this discharge comes from a regulation, termed a “new
source performance standard,” that it has promulgated under authority granted to it by
§306(b) of the CWA. Section 306(b) gives the EPA authority to regulate the amount of
pollutants that certain categories of new sources may discharge into the navigable waters
of the United States. 33 U.S.C. § 1316(b). Pursuant to this authority, the EPA in 1982
promulgated a new source performance standard restricting discharges from new frothflotation gold mines like Coeur Alaska’s. The standard is stringent: It allows “no discharge
of process wastewater” from these mines. 40 C.F.R. § 440.104(b)(1).
Applying that standard to the discharge of water from Lower Slate Lake into the
downstream creek, the EPA’s § 402 permit sets strict limits on the amount of pollutants the
water may contain. The permit requires Coeur Alaska to treat the water using “reverse
osmosis” to remove aluminum, suspended solids, and other pollutants. App. 298a; id., at
304a. Coeur Alaska must monitor the water flowing from the lake to be sure that the
207

pollutants are kept to low, specified minimums. Id., at 326a–330a.
C
SEACC brought suit against the Corps of Engineers and various of its officials in the United
States District Court for the District of Alaska. The Corps permit was not in accordance with
law, SEACC argued, for two reasons. First, in SEACC’s view, the permit was issued by the
wrong agency—Coeur Alaska ought to have sought a §402 permit from the EPA, just as
the company did for the discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek. See
Part I–B–2, supra. Second, SEACC contended that regardless of which agency issued the
permit, the discharge itself is unlawful because it will violate the EPA new source
performance standard for froth-flotation gold mines. (This is the same performance
standard described above, which the EPA has already applied to the discharge of water
from the lake into the downstream creek. See ibid.) SEACC argued that this performance
standard also applies to the discharge of slurry into the lake. It contended further that the
performance standard is a binding implementation of §306. Section 306(e) of the CWA
makes it “unlawful” for Coeur Alaska to “operate” the mine “in violation of” the EPA’s
performance standard. 33 U.S.C. § 1316(e).
Coeur Alaska and the State of Alaska intervened as defendants. Both sides moved for
summary judgment. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the
defendants. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and ordered the District
Court to vacate the Corps of Engineers’ permit. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v.
United States Army Corps of Engs., 486 F.3d 638, 654–655 (2007).
The Court of Appeals concluded that Coeur Alaska required a § 402 permit for its slurry
discharge, that the Corps lacked authority to issue such a permit under § 404, and that the
proposed discharge was unlawful because it would violate the EPA new source
performance standard and § 306(e).
The decision of the Court of Appeals in effect reallocated the division of responsibility that
the Corps and the EPA had been following. The Court granted certiorari. We now hold that
the decision of the Court of Appeals was incorrect.
II
The question of which agency has authority to consider whether to permit the slurry
discharge is our beginning inquiry. We consider first the authority of the EPA and second
the authority of the Corps. Our conclusion is that under the CWA the Corps had authority
to determine whether Coeur Alaska was entitled to the permit governing this discharge.
A

208

Section 402 gives the EPA authority to issue “permit[s] for the discharge of any pollutant,”
with one important exception: The EPA may not issue permits for fill material that fall under
the Corps’ § 404 permitting authority. * * *
Section 402 thus forbids the EPA from exercising permitting authority that is ‘provided [to
the Corps] in § 404.
***
The Act is best understood to provide that if the Corps has authority to issue a permit for a
discharge under § 404, then the EPA lacks authority to do so under § 402.
Even if there were ambiguity on this point, the EPA’s own regulations would resolve it.
Those regulations provide that “[d]ischarges of dredged or fill material into waters of the
United States which are regulated under section 404 of CWA” “do not require permits” from
the EPA. 40 C.F.R. § 122.3.
In SEACC’s view, this regulation implies that some “fill material” discharges are not
regulated under § 404—else, SEACC asks, why would the regulation lack a comma before
the word “which,” and thereby imply that only a subset of “discharges of … fill material” are
“regulated under section 404.” Ibid.
The agencies, however, have interpreted this regulation otherwise. In the agencies’ view
the regulation essentially restates the text of § 402, and forbids the EPA from issuing
permits for discharges that “are regulated under section 404.” 40 C.F.R. § 122.3(b); cf.
CWA § 402(a) (“[e]xcept as provided in … [§ 404], the Administrator may . . . issue a
permit”). Before us, the EPA confirms this reading of the regulation. Brief for Federal
Respondents 27. The agency’s interpretation is not “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with
the regulation”; and so we accept it as correct. Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S.452, 461 (1997)
(internal quotation marks omitted).
The question whether the EPA is the proper agency to regulate the slurry discharge thus
depends on whether the Corps of Engineers has authority to do so. If the Corps has
authority to issue a permit, then the EPA may not do so. We turn to the Corps’ authority
under § 404.
B
Section 404(a) gives the Corps power to “issue permits … for the discharge of dredged or
fill material.” 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a). As all parties concede, the slurry meets the definition of
fill material agreed upon by the agencies in a joint regulation promulgated in 2002. That
regulation defines “fill material” to mean any “material [that] has the effect of … [c]hanging
the bottom elevation” of water—a definition that includes “slurry, or tailings or similar
209

mining-related materials.” 40 C.F.R. § 232.2.
SEACC concedes that the slurry to be discharged meets the regulation’s definition of fill
material. Brief for Respondent SEACC et al. 20. Its concession on this point is appropriate
because slurry falls well within the central understanding of the term “fill,” as shown by the
examples given by the regulation. See 40 C.F.R. § 232.2 (“Examples of such fill material
include, but are not limited to: rock, sand, soil, clay … .”). The regulation further excludes
“trash or garbage” from its definition. Ibid. SEACC expresses a concern that Coeur Alaska’s
interpretation of the statute will lead to §404 permits authorizing the discharges of other
solids that are now restricted by EPA standards. Brief for Respondent SEACC et al. 44–45
(listing, for example, “feces and uneaten feed,” “litter,” and waste produced in “battery
manufacturing”). But these extreme instances are not presented by the cases now before
us. If, in a future case, a discharger of one of these solids were to seek a § 404 permit, the
dispositive question for the agencies would be whether the solid at issue—for instance,
“feces and uneaten feed”—came within the regulation’s definition of “fill.” SEACC cites no
instance in which the agencies have so interpreted their fill regulation. If that instance did
arise, and the agencies were to interpret the fill regulation as SEACC fears, then SEACC
could challenge that decision as an unlawful interpretation of the fill regulation; or SEACC
could claim that the fill regulation as interpreted is an unreasonable interpretation of § 404.
The difficulties are not presented here, however, because the slurry meets the regulation’s
definition of fill.
Rather than challenge the agencies’ decision to define the slurry as fill, SEACC instead
contends that § 404 contains an implicit exception. According to SEACC, § 404 does not
authorize the Corps to permit a discharge of fill material if that material is subject to an EPA
new source performance standard.
But §404’s text does not limit its grant of power in this way. Instead, § 404 refers to all “fill
material” without qualification. Nor do the EPA regulations support SEACC’s reading of §
404. The EPA has enacted guidelines, pursuant to § 404(b), to guide the Corps permitting
decision. 40 C.F.R. pt. 230. Those guidelines do not strip the Corps of power to issue
permits for fill in cases where the fill is also subject to an EPA new source performance
standard.
SEACC’s reading of § 404 would create numerous difficulties for the regulated industry. As
the regulatory regime stands now, a discharger must ask a simple question—is the
substance to be discharged fill material or not? The fill regulation, 40 C.F.R. § 232.2, offers
a clear answer to that question; and under the agencies’ view, that answer decides the
matter—if the discharge is fill, the discharger must seek a § 404 permit from the Corps; if
not, only then must the discharger consider whether any EPA performance standard
applies, so that the discharger requires a § 402 permit from the EPA.
Under SEACC’s interpretation, however, the discharger would face a more difficult problem.
210

The discharger would have to ask—is the fill material also subject to one of the many
hundreds of EPA performance standards, so that the permit must come from the EPA, not
the Corps? The statute gives no indication that Congress intended to burden industry with
that confusing division of permit authority.
The regulatory scheme discloses a defined, and workable, line for determining whether the
Corps or the EPA has the permit authority. Under this framework, the Corps of Engineers,
and not the EPA, has authority to permit Coeur Alaska’s discharge of the slurry.
[In Part III of the opinion, the Court determined that the Corps did not act unlawfully by
failing to include conditions in the Section 404 permit that would be necessary to comply
with the new source performance standards of Section 306 of the Clean Water Act.]
***
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Souter join, dissenting:
Petitioner Coeur Alaska, Inc., proposes to discharge 210,000 gallons per day of mining
waste into Lower Slate Lake, a 23-acre subalpine lake in Tongass National Forest. The
“tailings slurry” would contain concentrations of aluminum, copper, lead, and mercury. Over
the life of the mine, roughly 4.5 million tons of solid tailings would enter the lake, raising the
bottom elevation by 50 feet. It is undisputed that the discharge would kill all of the lake’s
fish and nearly all of its other aquatic life.1
Coeur Alaska’s proposal is prohibited by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
performance standard forbidding any discharge of process wastewater from new “frothflotation” mills into waters of the United States. See 40 C.F.R. § 440.104(b)(1) (2008).
Section 306 of the Clean Water Act directs EPA to promulgate such performance
standards, 33 U.S.C. § 1316(a), and declares it unlawful for any discharger to violate them,
§ 1316(e). Ordinarily, that would be the end of the inquiry.
Coeur Alaska contends, however, that its discharge is not subject to EPA’s regulatory
regime, but is governed, instead, by the mutually exclusive permitting authority of the Army
Corps of Engineers. The Corps has authority, under § 404 of the Act, § 1344(a), to issue
permits for discharges of “dredged or fill material.” By regulation, a discharge that has the
effect of raising a water body’s bottom elevation qualifies as “fill material.” See 33 C.F.R. §
323.2(e) (2008). Discharges properly within the Corps’ permitting authority, it is undisputed,
1

Whether aquatic life will eventually be able to inhabit the lake again is uncertain. Compare
ante, at 5, with App. 201a–202a; and Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. United

are not subject to EPA performance standards. See ante, at 20; Brief for Petitioner Coeur
Alaska 26; Brief for Respondent Southeast Alaska Conservation Council et al. 37.
The litigation before the Court thus presents a single question: Is a pollutant discharge
prohibited under § 306 of the Act eligible for a § 404 permit as a discharge of fill material?
In agreement with the Court of Appeals, I would answer no. The statute’s text, structure,
and purpose all mandate adherence to EPA pollution-control requirements. A discharge
covered by a performance standard must be authorized, if at all, by EPA.
I
A
Congress enacted the Clean Water Act in 1972 “to restore and maintain the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity” of the waters of the United States. 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a).
“The use of any river, lake, stream or ocean as a waste treatment system,” the Act’s
drafters stated, “is unacceptable.” S. Rep. No. 92–414, p. 7 (1971). Congress announced in
the Act itself an ambitious objective: to eliminate, by 1985, the discharge of all pollutants
into the Nation’s navigable waters. 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a).
In service of its goals, Congress issued a core command: “[T]he discharge of any pollutant
by any person shall be unlawful,” except in compliance with the Act’s terms. § 1311(a). * * *
The Act instructs EPA to establish various technology-based, increasingly stringent effluent
limitations for categories of point sources. E.g., §§ 1311, 1314. These limitations,
formulated as restrictions “on quantities, rates, and concentrations of chemical, physical,
biological, and other constituents,” § 1362(11), were imposed to achieve national uniformity
among categories of sources. See, e.g., E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, 430 U.S.
112, 129–130 (1977). The limitations for a given discharge depend on the type of pollutant
and source at issue. * * *
Of key importance, new sources must meet stringent “standards of performance” adopted
by EPA under § 306. That section makes it “unlawful for any … new source to operate … in
violation of” an applicable performance standard. 33 U.S.C. § 1316(e) (emphasis added). In
line with Congress’ aim “to insure …‘maximum feasible control of new sources,’ ” du Pont,
430 U.S., at 138, the preferred standard for a new source is one “ ‘permitting no discharge
of pollutants,’ ” id., at 137–138 (quoting 33 U.S.C. § 1316(a)(1) (emphasis added)).
Moreover, new sources, unlike existing sources, are not eligible for EPA-granted variances
from applicable limitations. 430 U.S., at 138. * * *
In 1982, EPA promulgated new source performance standards for facilities engaged in
mining, including those using a froth-flotation milling process. See Ore Mining and
Dressing Point Source Category Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source
212

Performance Standards, 47 Fed. Reg. 54598 (1982). Existing mills, the Agency found,
were already achieving zero discharge; it was therefore practicable, EPA concluded, for
new mills to do as well. Id., at 54602. Accordingly, under 40 C.F.R. § 440.104(b)(1), new
mines using the froth-flotation method, as Coeur Alaska proposes to do, may not discharge
wastewater directly into waters of the United States.
B
The nationwide pollution-control requirements just described are implemented through the
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), a permitting scheme set forth in
§ 402 and administered by EPA and the States. The NPDES is the linchpin of the Act, for it
transforms generally applicable effluent limitations into the individual obligations of each
discharger. EPA v. California ex rel. State Water Resources Control Bd., 426 U.S. 200, 205
(1976). The discharge of a pollutant is generally prohibited unless the source has obtained
a NPDES permit. E.g., EPA v. National Crushed Stone Assn., 449 U.S. 64, 71 (1980)
(“Section 402 authorizes the establishment of the [NPDES], under which every discharger
of pollutants is required to obtain a permit.”).
The Act also establishes a separate permitting scheme, administered by the Corps, for
discharges of “dredged or fill material.” 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a). Section 404 hews to the
Corps’ established expertise in matters of navigability and construction. The § 404 program
does not implement the uniform, technology-based pollution-control standards set out, inter
alia, in § 306. Instead, § 404 permits are subject to regulatory guidelines based generally
on the impact of a discharge on the receiving environment. See § 1344(b); ante, at 4–5.
As the above-described statutory background indicates, Coeur Alaska’s claim to a § 404
permit carries weighty implications. If eligible for that permit, Coeur Alaska can evade the
exacting performance standard prescribed by EPA for froth-flotation mills. It may, instead,
use Lower Slate Lake “as the settling pond and disposal site for the tailings.” App. 360a
(Corps’ Record of Decision).
II
Is a pollutant discharge prohibited under § 306(e) eligible to receive a § 404 permit as a
discharge of fill material? All agree on preliminary matters. Only one agency, the Corps or
EPA, can issue a permit for the discharge. See ante, at 10, 22. Only EPA, through the
NPDES program, issues permits that implement § 306. See supra, at 2. Further, § 306(e)
and EPA’s froth-flotation performance standard, unless inapplicable here, bar Coeur
Alaska’s proposed discharge. See ante, at 14–15.
No part of the statutory scheme, in my view, calls into question the governance of EPA’s
performance standard. The text of § 306(e) states a clear proscription: “[I]t shall be unlawful
for any owner or operator of any new source to operate such source in violation of any
213

standard of performance applicable to such source.” 33 U.S.C. § 1316(e). Under the
standard of performance relevant here, “there shall be no discharge of process wastewater
to navigable waters from mills that use the froth-flotation process” for mining gold. 40
C.F.R. § 440.104(b)(1). The Act imposes these requirements without qualification.
Section 404, stating that the Corps “may issue permits” for the discharge of “dredged or fill
material,” does not create an exception to §306(e)’s plain command. 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a).
Cf. ante, at 12. Section 404 neither mentions § 306 nor states a contrary requirement. The
Act can be home to both provisions, with no words added or omitted, so long as the
category of “dredged or fill material” eligible for a § 404 permit is read in harmony with §
306. Doing so yields a simple rule: Discharges governed by EPA performance standards
are subject to EPA’s administration and receive permits under the NPDES, not § 404.
This reading accords with the Act’s structure and objectives. It retains, through the NPDES,
uniform application of the Act’s core pollution-control requirements, and it respects
Congress’ special concern for new sources. Leaving pollution-related decisions to EPA,
moreover, is consistent with Congress’ delegation to that agency of primary responsibility to
administer the Act. Most fundamental, adhering to § 306(e)’s instruction honors the
overriding statutory goal of eliminating water pollution, and Congress’ particular rejection of
the use of navigable waters as waste disposal sites. See supra, at 2–3. See also 33 U.S.C.
§ 1324 (creating “clean lakes” program requiring States to identify and restore polluted
lakes). * * *
Questions and Comments
1.

Did the case involve any addition of pollutants into wetlands? If not, does it have any
implications for disposal of slurry and mining waste in wetlands?

2.

In its recitation of the facts, the majority indicates that the Corps determined that
disposal of the slurry in Lower Slate Lake was the “least environmentally damaging
practicable” way to dispose of the tailings and the court contrasted the harm that
would be caused to the lake with the permanent loss of wetlands that would occur
under one of the alternative proposals that involved storing the tailings near the
mine in a “dry tailings facility.” However, the Court does not mention that the “dry
tailings facility” alternative would destroy the most common types of wetlands in
Alaska, while the activities associated with disposal in the Lake would affect a
greater variety of wetland types. See U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska
Department of Natural Resources, Kensington Gold Project, Final Environmental
Impact Statement § 4.12.3 (Dec. 2004). EPA determined that the alternative
involving the construction of the “dry tailings facility” was the “environmentally
preferred alternative.” Id. at 5. The Court also indicates that EPA deferred to the
214

Corps’ determination that the disposal of the tailings in the Lake was
“environmentally preferable” because EPA did not veto the Corps permit. Do you
agree? What is the standard for EPA’s exercise of its veto? See 33 U.S.C. §
1344(c). What considerations impact EPA’s decision regarding whether to veto a
Corps permit? Chapter 8 of this book examines EPA’s veto authority in detail.
3.

The case involves two questions: (a) whether the Corps or EPA has authority to
issue a permit for the addition of the slurry to the Lower Slate Lake; and (b) whether
the Corps acted in accordance with the law when it issued the Section 404 permit to
Coeur. With regard to the first question, does the Court address the question
whether the slurry is “fill” material under the Corps’ regulatory definition and, if so,
whether the regulatory definition is within the Corps’ authority under the Clean Water
Act? If not, why not?

4.

What is the basis for SEACC’s argument that the Corps does not have authority
under Section 404 to issue permits for the disposal of the mine slurry in Lower Slate
Lake? On what tools of statutory interpretation does the majority rely to conclude
that the Corps can issue such permits? In light of the approach taken by the
majority, could EPA change its interpretation of the statute and assert jurisdiction
over disposal activities like Coeur’s in the future? Does the dissent agree with the
majority that industries like the mining industry would find it difficult to determine
whether EPA had adopted technology based standards that applied to their pollution
discharges?

5.

Does the Court’s decision provide industries with an end run around EPA’s
technology-based standards? If EPA issued the permit under section 402, rather
than the Corps issuing the permit under Section 404, the permit would prohibit
Coeur from discharging any “process wastewater” from the mine into the Lake. On
what statutory interpretation tools does the dissent rely to determine that EPA,
rather than the Corps, should issue permits for discharges of fill material by
industries when EPA has adopted technology based standards that apply to those
industries?

6.

On the second question, regarding whether the Corps acted within its authority in
issuing a Section 404 permit for the disposal of the mine slurry without requiring the
permittee to comply with EPA’s technology based standards, the majority concluded
that the statute and regulations were ambiguous, but that the agencies’
interpretation of the ambiguous regulations was reasonable and entitled to Auer
deference. While Justice Scalia concurred in the result, he wrote separately to
criticize the majority’s approach. He pointed out that United States v. Mead, 533
U.S. 218 (2001), a case from which he dissented, limited the situations in which
Chevron deference applied. See Coeur Alaska, Inc. v. Southeast Alaska
Conservation Council, 557 U.S. 261, 295 (Scalia, dissenting). Although he
215

disagreed with Mead, Scalia criticized the majority for, in essence, creating an end
run around Mead by holding that the agencies’ interpretation of the Clean Water Act
was not entitled to Chevron deference but according the agencies a similar degree
of deference in reviewing their interpretation of their regulations. Id. He argued that
the Court should not accord agencies Auer deference when the statute and
regulation being interpreted are both ambiguous. Id. Nevertheless, he concurred
with the majority’s ruling, because he thought that the agencies actions were
reasonable, and he wrote, “I favor overruling Mead. Failing that, I am pleased to join
an opinion that effectively ignores it.” 557 U.S. at 296.

Post-script: The Kensington Mine began operations on July 3, 2010 and currently
has over 300 employees. Operating costs at the mine for 2013 were $890 per
ounce. See Coeur Mining, Kensington, Alaska. In 2006, before the mine started
operations, it paid a fine of $18,334 to EPA for stormwater violations associated with
construction. See Elizabeth Bluemink, Kensington Gold Mine Operator to Pay
$170,000 Federal Fine, Anchorage Daily News (Dec. 15, 2010). The following year,
it began discharging sediment and acidic stormwater into a nearby creek in violation
of the Clean Water Act. Id. EPA discovered the violations the following year and the
mine operator paid a $170,000 fine in 2010 for violations between 2006 and 2010.

Chapter 6
Section 404 Permits
The cornerstone of federal wetlands protection is the Clean Water Act Section 404 permit
program. Chapters 4 and 5 of this book outlined the scope of activities that require a
Section 404 permit, but this Chapter will begin with a brief explanation of a few statutory
exemptions to the permit requirement that were not discussed in those chapters. Most of
the chapter, though, focuses on the processes and standards for the two types of Section
404 permits: General Permits and Individual Permits.

I.

Permit Exemptions

Section 404(f)(1) of the
Clean Water Act exempts
from the Section 404 permit
requirement
several
categories of activities that
are primarily associated with
farming.
Section
404(f)(1)(A), for instance,
exempts
discharges
associated with “normal
farming, silviculture, and
ranching activities such as
plowing, seeding, cultivating,
minor drainage, harvesting
for the production of food,
fiber and forest products, or
upland soil and water
conservation projects”. The
exemptions
in
Section Photo 31 USDA Photo 404(f)(1),
though,
are http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GreenCountyWI.jpg
tempered by a “recapture” provision in Section 404(f)(2), which requires a permit for the
activities if they are carried out for the purpose of changing the use of the property and they
impair the flow or circulation of navigable waters or reduce their reach. The exemption for
“normal farming, silviculture and ranching activities” is described in the following excerpt.

(7th Cir. 1985)

Bauer, Circuit Judge
In 1978, pursuant to litigation commenced under the Clean Water Act (CWA), * * * by the
United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), defendants Roland G. Huebner, William
Huebner and the Petenwell Potato Farms (Huebners), entered into a consent decree with
the Corps regarding the maintenance of the wetlands on their property. In 1983, following a
six-day hearing, the district court found the Huebners in contempt of the 1978 order and
ordered them to comply with a restoration plan developed by the Corps. The Huebners
appeal the lower court's contempt order and restoration plan. We affirm the district court's
finding of contempt * * *
In 1977, the Huebners, owners of a 4,000 acre vegetable farm, acquired "Bear Bluff
Farms," a 5,000 acre property in Jackson County, Wisconsin, the largest continuous area
of wetlands in Wisconsin. * * * Since the turn of the century Bear Bluff has been used
intermittently for a variety of agricultural purposes, including the production of dryland
crops, such as corn and oats. For the twenty years preceding the Huebners' ownership,
however, only cranberries have been grown on the land. * * * The record indicates that the
Huebners intended to expand the cranberry operations of Bear Bluff Farms and to use a
portion of the farm for growing vegetables and other upland crops.
In 1977, the Huebners began to plow sections of the farm to clear out existing ditches and
dig new ones. On September 2, 1977, the St. Paul District of the United States Army Corps
of Engineers issued several cease and desist orders to the Huebners, alleging that their
ditching activities constituted a permitless "discharge of dredged or fill material" into the
Bear Bluff wetlands in violation of section 301 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act,
* * * On November 10, 1977 the Corps filed a complaint in the district court seeking a
permanent injunction and a financial penalty against the Huebners. In June, 1978 the
parties settled the action by entering into a consent decree approved by District Judge
James E. Doyle.
The Huebners complied with the immediate restoration provisions of the consent order. On
November 16, 1982, however, the government moved for an order to show cause why the
Huebners should not be held in contempt for violating the 1978 order. The government,
through its affidavits, charged that dredged material had been placed on the sides of
Beaver Creek and was sliding into the adjacent wetlands, that a portion of the wetland had
been plowed and furrowed by a marsh plow, and that the dikes of the Hunter's Peak,
218

Juleane and Unnamed Reservoirs had been leveled and scraped by a bulldozer without
notice to the Corps and without any Corps permit allowing such activity. The Huebners had
planted barley in a plowed portion of the Hunter's Peak, and stated that they intended to
plant corn.5 * * *
On August 4, 1983 the district court entered an order holding the Huebners in civil
contempt of the court's 1978 consent order on the grounds that the government had proved
by "clear and convincing evidence" that the Huebners had made permitless discharges of
dredged and fill material into the Bear Bluff wetlands in violation of the 1978 order. The
Huebners allege that they are not in contempt of the district court's 1978 order because the
activities in which they engaged in on their land did not require a Corps permit. They allege
that the district court erred in its interpretation of the agricultural exemptions of the CWA, as
relevant to the 1978 consent order, in determining when permits are required. * * *
The Huebners did not challenge the authority of the Corps to regulate parts of Bear Bluff
Farms as wetlands in the district court, but argued that their activities were exempt from the
CWA's permit process under Section 1344(f)(1). The district court held that the phrase
"discharge of dredged or fill material" in the 1978 consent order incorporated the legal
meaning of those terms under the CWA and therefore the question of whether the
Huebners' permitless activities violated the terms of the 1978 consent decree hinged on the
court's interpretation of the scope of Section 1344(f)(1)'s exemptions. The district court held
that "[i]t is clear that the amendments that created the subsection (f) exceptions on which
defendants rely were not intended to exempt all farming operations from the permit
requirements, but only those whose effect upon wetlands or other waters was so minimal
as not to warrant federal review and supervision." R. 118, Order at 17-18. The court then
analyzed the defendants' actions in light of the purposes of the Clean Water Act, the intent
of Congress in enacting the farming exceptions, and the terms of the 1978 order. Our
review of the legislative history confirms the conclusion reached by the lower court.
Section 1344(f)(1) provides exemptions from the permit process for discharges into
wetlands caused by agricultural activities, such as plowing and the maintenance of dikes,
ponds, and farm roads.* * * The exceptions of Section 1344(f)(1) are subject to section
1344(f)(2), however, which provides that discharges are not exempt from the permit
process if they bring "an area of the navigable waters into a use to which it was not
previously subject, where the flow or circulation of navigable waters may be impaired or the
reach of such waters be reduced."
Our review of the legislative history of the agricultural exemptions convinces us that
5

The Huebners stated that they needed an immediate cash crop to pay for the equipment
costs of their dredge and fill activities. R. 51. Cranberries take several years to become fully
productive.
219

because of the significance of inland wetlands, which make up eighty-five percent of the
nation's wetlands, * * * Congress intended that Section 1344(f)(1) exempt from the permit
process only "narrowly defined activities ... that cause little or no adverse effects either
individually or cumulatively [and which do not] convert more extensive areas of water into
dry land or impede circulation or reduce the reach and size of the water body." 3
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY at 420 (statement of Rep. Harsha, member of the conference
committee, during House debates). See also id. at 474. The Fifth Circuit also has held that
Sec. 1344(f)(1) was designed to be a "narrow exemption." Avoyelles Sportsmen's League,
Inc. v. Marsh, 715 F.2d 897, 925 n.44 (5th Cir.1983).
Recognizing that "there has been widespread concern that many activities that are normally
considered routine would be prohibited or made extremely difficult because of the complex
regulatory procedures," 4 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY 897 (statement of Sen. Randolph),
Congress enacted in the 1977 amendments a delicate balance of exceptions that protected
wetlands while permitting routine activities to go on unimpeded.
The drainages exemption is very clearly intended to put to rest, once and for all, the fears
that permits are required for draining poorly drained farm or forest land of which millions of
acres exist. No permits are required for such drainage. Permits are required only where
ditches or channels are dredged in a swamp, marsh, bog or other truly aquatic area. 4
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY 1042 (statement of Sen. Muskie). * * * We therefore affirm the
district court's narrow interpretation of the agricultural exemptions and its incorporation of
the purpose of those exemptions into the finding of contempt against the Huebners for
violation of the 1978 consent decree.
Questions and Comments
1.

Note that the court interpreted the exemption in Section 404(f)(1) narrowly to only
exempt activities that “cause little or no adverse effects” on waters of the United
States. Other Circuits have taken a similar approach. See Borden Ranch
Partnership v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 261 F.3d 810 (9th Cir. 2001), aff’d by
an equally divided court, 537 U.S. 99 (2002); United States v. Larkins, 852 F.2d 189
(6th Cir. 1988). Note, also, that the recapture provision of Section 404(f)(2) focuses
on both the purpose of an activity (“bringing an area of the navigable waters into a
use to which it was not previously subject”) and the effect of the activity (“where the
flow or circulation of navigable waters may be impaired or the reach of such waters
be reduced”). For a more general outline of the environmental regulation of farming,
see J.B. Ruhl, Farms, Their Environmental Harms, and Environmental Law, 27
Ecology L. Q. 263 (2000).

2.

Other exemptions: Section 404(f)(1) also exempts, from the Section 404 permit
requirement, discharges associated with maintenance of dikes, dams, levees, and
similar structures (404(f)(1)(B)); construction or maintenance of farm or stock ponds
220

or irrigation ditches or maintenance of drainage ditches (404(f)(1)(C)); construction
of temporary sedimentation basins (404(f)(1)(D)); construction of various farm,
forest, or mining roads constructed in accordance with best management practices
(404(f)(1)(E)); and discharges from activities with respect to approved non-point
source programs (404(f)(1)(F)).
3.

Regulations and guidance: The Corps regulations implementing the Section
404(f)(1) exemptions are codified at 33 C.F.R. § 323.4 In addition, in May 1990,
EPA and the Corps issued a joint memorandum addressing the exemptions. See
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of the Army,
Memorandum: Clean Water Act Section 404 Regulatory Program and Agricultural
Activities (May 1990). The regulations and memo make it clear that farmers who
have been farming wetlands as part of an established, ongoing operation do not
have to obtain a Section 404 permit for those activities as long as the farmer doesn’t
convert the wetlands to dray land. Id.

4.

Interaction with Swampbuster: The Corps regulatory definition of “waters of the
United States” excludes “prior converted cropland.” 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(a)(8). Thus, if
a wetland was converted to cropland prior to the enactment of the Food Security
Act, see Chapter 2, infra, and meets the definition of “prior converted cropland”, a
Section 404 permit is not required for activities in that cropland. However, although
the Natural Resources Conservation Agency makes determinations regarding the
delineation of wetlands and the application of the Swampbuster provisions to
farmers, see Chapter 2, infra, the Corps’ regulations explicitly provide that
“Notwithstanding the determination of an area's status as prior converted cropland
by any other Federal agency, for the purposes of the Clean Water Act, the final
authority regarding Clean Water Act jurisdiction remains with EPA.” 33 C.F.R. §
328.3(a)(8).

II.

Nationwide and Other General Permits

Five years after Congress created the Section 404 permit program, it amended the Clean
Water Act to authorize the Corps of Engineers to approve the discharge of dredged or fill
material through general permits, in addition to individual permits. See 33 U.S.C. §
1344(e). Unlike individual permits, persons can often engage in the activities authorized by
a general permit without applying to the Corps of Engineers for an individualized review of
their activities and the effect of their activities on the environment. Instead, as long as the
persons are engaged in activities authorized by the general permit and are complying with
any terms or conditions of the permit, they do not need to obtain an individual Section 404
permit. For instance, the Corps of Engineers has issued nationwide general permits that
authorize landowners to construct temporary recreational structures, reshape drainage
ditches, build boat ramps and engage in a variety of other activities without applying for
individual Section 404 permits, as long as they comply with the conditions in the nationwide
221

general permit. See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2012 Nationwide Permits, Conditions,
District Engineer’s Decision, Further Information, and Definitions (with corrections).
Landowners can save significant time and money if their activities are authorized by a
general permit. Even though some general permits require individualized review, as
described below, the average time for processing nationwide general permits in 2010 was
32 days, compared to an average of 221 days for processing individual permit applications.
See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Reissuance of Nationwide Permits, 77 Fed. Reg.
10184, 10190 (Feb. 21, 2012). Regarding cost, a 2002 study found that the cost of
preparing the documentation necessary to undertake activities authorized by a nationwide
permit was about 1/10 the cost of preparing the documentation necessary for an individual
permit. See David Sunding & David Zilberman, The Economics of Environmental
Regulation by Licensing: An Assessment of Recent Changes to the Wetland Permitting
Process, 42 Nat. Res. J. 59, 74 (2002).
Most of the discharges of dredged or fill material that take place every year are authorized
by general permits, rather than individual permits. In 2007 and 2008, for instance,
approximately 95% of the discharges that were authorized by a Section 404 permit were
authorized by a general permit, rather than an individual permit. See Royal C. Gardner,
Lawyers, Swamps, and Money 102 (Island Press, 2011). There are currently 50 Nationwide
permits in force, in addition to regional and State-wide general permits. See U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, 2012 Nationwide Permits, Conditions, District Engineer’s Decision,
Further Information, and Definitions (with corrections).
While general permits provide many advantages for landowners, the Clean Water Act limits
the duration of nationwide permits and other general permits to five years. See 33 U.S.C. §
1344(e)(2). In addition, the Corps has the authority to revoke or modify general permits if it
determines, after opportunity for a public hearing, “that the activities authorized by the
general permit have an adverse impact on the environment or such activities are more
appropriately authorized by individual permits.” Id. Both the Corps and EPA have adopted
general permit regulations. See 33 C.F.R. Part 325 (Corps’ regulations); 40 C.F.R. § 230.7
(EPA’s regulations).
A.

Issuance of General Permits

The Clean Water Act authorizes the Corps of Engineers, “after notice and opportunity for
public hearing” to issue general permits “on a State, regional or nationwide basis”, 33
U.S.C. § 1344(e), and the agency has issued all of those types of permits. The three
categories of general permits that the Corps issues are: (1) nationwide permits; (2) state
and regional permits; and (3) programmatic general permits. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.5(c).
Nationwide permits authorize dredge and fill activities on a national basis and the agency
issues those permits through the traditional notice and comment rulemaking process. See
33 C.F.R. § 330.1(b). While nationwide permits are developed at the Corps’ headquarters,
222

state and regional permits are issued by the district or division offices of the Corps of
Engineers after a public notice and authorize activities within the State or region that issued
the permit. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.3. Programmatic general permits are founded on
existing federal, state or local programs to avoid duplication with those programs, so they
may be issued on a national, state or regional level. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.5. In addition to
general permits, the Corps authorizes some activities through letters of permission,
another streamlined alternative to individual permits. Id. § 325.5(b)(2). The abbreviated
procedures for letters of permission do not include a public notice. See 33 C.F.R. §
325.2(e)(1).
Questions and Comments
1.

Public participation: The level and tone of public comments on the nationwide
permits has evolved significantly over the years. The first nationwide permits were
issued by the Corps in 1977 and the Corps received 163 comments on the proposal,
most of which were positive comments. See 42 Fed. Reg. 37122, 37130 (July 19,
1977). When the permits were reissued in 1996, the Corps received 4000 comments
after one national public hearing and six regional public hearings. See 61 Fed. Reg.
65874 (Dec. 13, 1996). By 2007, the number of public comments grew to 22,500,
see 72 Fed. Reg. 11092 (March 12, 2007), and in 2012, the Corps received 26,600
comments when it reissued the nationwide permits. See 77 Fed. Reg. 10184 (Feb.
21, 2102). 26,300 of 26,600 comments were form letters addressing a single
nationwide permit (NWP 21). Id. A significant portion of the comments that the
Corps received were critical of various provisions of the program. How might that
impact the time or resources required by the agency to reissue nationwide permits?

2.

Publication of the permits: Until 1996, the nationwide general permits issued by
the Corps of Engineers were published in the Federal Register as an Appendix to
the nationwide permit regulations at 33 C.F.R. § 330. When the permits were
reissued in 1996, however, the agency indicated that from that time forward, the
nationwide permits would be published in the Federal register and announced with
regional conditions in the public notices issued by the Corps' district offices and
posted on the Internet. See 61 Fed. Reg. 65874 (Dec. 13, 1996). What are the
advantages of publication in that manner?

3.

Challenging NWPs: Is the issuance of nationwide permits a final agency action that
can be challenged in court? See National Association of Home Builders v. U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, 417 F.3d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 2005). What other impediments
might litigants face if they wanted to make a facial challenge to nationwide permits
immediately upon their adoption?

223

B.

Conditions of General Permits

Although general permits are issued through a different process than individual permits and
authorize activities by numerous actors, as opposed to a single applicant, general permits
are still Section 404 permits and must comply with the legal requirements that apply to
those permits. Accordingly, general permits will include conditions that are necessary to
comply with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and any other applicable laws. In
some cases, the conditions will even require an individualized review by the Corps of the
prospective permittee’s proposed activities.
Most significantly, the permits must include conditions to comply with the Section 404(b)(1)
guidelines, described in the next section, that were developed by EPA and the Corps to
establish the standards that apply to the review and issuance of all Section 404 permits.
See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(e)(1)(A). Thus, some general permits may require landowners to
mitigate the harm to wetlands caused by their activities by creating, restoring, enhancing or
preserving other wetlands. See Chapter 7, infra.
In addition, as outlined in Part III of this Chapter, depending on the nature and location of
the activity being authorized by the Corps, the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C.
§§ 1451, et seq., the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531, et seq., the National
Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 470, et seq., and other laws may require the
Corps to consult with other agencies or may impose limits on the scope of the activities the
Corps can authorize when it issues Section 404 permits. In order to comply with those
laws, the Corps may consult with the other agencies as part of the process for issuing the
general permits and the Corps will include conditions in the general permits required by the
other laws or suggested by the agencies through the consultation process. See U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, 2012 Nationwide Permits, Conditions, District Engineer’s Decision,
Further Information, and Definitions (with corrections).
For instance, the Clean Water Act includes a process, Section 401 certification, whereby
States can veto or impose conditions on a variety of federal permits, including Section 404
permits, to ensure that the permits comply with State water quality standards. See 33
U.S.C. § 1341. To comply with that process, the Corps will frequently seek 401 certification
from States when developing a general permit and the Corps is required to seek such
certification before issuing a nationwide permit. See 33 C.F.R. § 330.4(c)(1). While States
can certify that the general permit, as proposed, will meet their water quality standards,
they can also refuse certification (in essence, prohibiting the use of the general permit in
their State) or they can require the Corps to include conditions in the general permit to
comply with State water quality standards (including a condition that requires approval from
the State for individual projects that will be conducted under the general permit.) Id. §
330.4(c). The Corps of Engineers issued a Regulatory Guidance Letter in 1992 to address
the relationship between general permits and the Section 401 certification process,
including the conditions that States could appropriately include in those permits. See U.S.
224

Army Corps of Engineers, RGL 92-04, Section 401 Water Quality Certification and Coastal
Zone Management Act Conditions for Nationwide Permits (Sept. 1992).
When developing general permits, the Corps engages in similar consultation with States
that have approved Coastal Zone Management Plans to ensure that the permits include
conditions necessary to comply with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Id. While the
Corps consults with States and other agencies when developing general permits if another
statute requires the Corps to consult when issuing permits, a Corps nationwide permit
might not incorporate conditions to comply with all federal, state and local laws, so the
agency’s regulations clearly provide that nationwide permits “do not obviate the need to
obtain other Federal, state or local permits, approvals or authorizations required by law.”
See 33 C.F.R. § 330.4(b)(2).
In addition to the conditions described above, the Corps frequently includes a condition in
general permits that requires persons who intend to undertake activities authorized by the
permit to notify the Corps prior to undertaking those activities (provide a “pre-construction
notification”). See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2012 Nationwide Permits, Conditions,
District Engineer’s Decision, Further Information, and Definitions (with corrections) 37. In
some cases, the permit also includes a condition that precludes persons from undertaking
actions authorized by the permit until the Corps has reviewed and approved their proposed
action. Id. at 37-41. Even in those cases, though, the process for the landowner is faster
than the individual Section 404 permit process.
Questions and Comments
1.

National Environmental Policy Act compliance: The National Environmental
Policy Act requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact
statement (EIS) for major federal actions that significantly affect the quality of the
human environment, see 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). The EIS examines the
environmental effects of the proposed agency action and alternatives to the agency
action and is developed with public participation. Id. If it is not clear whether an
action will have a sufficient impact on the environment to require the preparation of
an EIS, agencies generally are required to prepare an environmental assessment
(EA) to determine if an environmental impact statement is necessary. See 40 C.F.R.
§ 1501.4. An EA is a more streamlined study of the effects of the action and
alternatives. Id. § 1508.9. When the agency completes the EA, it will either
determine that the impacts of the action are not significant enough to require an EIS
and it will issue a “finding of no significant impact” (FONSI) or it will determine
that an EIS is necessary, and it will prepare one. Id. § 1501.4. Since the issuance of
a permit is a federal action under NEPA, the Corps must prepare an EIS or EA when
issuing a Section 404 permit, either as an individual permit or a general permit.
When the Corps issues nationwide permits or other general permits, it usually
225

prepares an EA or EIS for the permit before it provides notice of the proposed permit
and the Corps provides for the public participation required by NEPA as part of the
development of the permit. See 33 C.F.R. § 330.5(b)(3). Even though the Corps
generally prepares at least an EA when issuing a nationwide permit, courts have
invalidated several of the Corps’ general permits on the grounds that the agency
failed to prepare adequate environmental analyses under NEPA.
For instance, NWP 29, the nationwide permit that the Corps issued to authorize
discharges for construction of single family housing was invalidated in 1998 in
Alaska Center for the Environment v. West, 31 F. Supp. 714 (D. Alaska 1998), but it
was subsequently reissued in a modified form. More recently, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit invalidated NWP 21, the nationwide surface
coal mining permits that authorized the discharges associated with valley fills
discussed in Chapter 5 of this book, see Kentucky Riverkeeper, Inc. v. Rowelette,
714 F.3d 402 (6th Cir. 2013).
2.

Modification, Suspension or Revocation of NWPs: As noted above, the Corps
has statutory authority to revoke or modify general permits if the agency determines
that the activities authorized by the permit have an adverse impact on the
environment or are more appropriately authorized by individual permits. See 33
U.S.C. § 1344(e)(2). Accordingly, the Corps’ regulations for nationwide permits
provide that the agency can modify the permits (by imposing additional or revised
terms or conditions on the permit), suspend the permits or revoke the permits for a
geographic area, class of activity, class of waters, or even for specific individual
activities. See 33 C.F.R. § 330.4(e).

3.

Expiring RGLs: RGL 92-04, and some of the other RGLs cited in this book, may
have technically expired, but the Corps issued a regulatory guidance letter in 2005
that provides that many of the RGLs that technically have expired “provide useful
information and ... are still generally applicable to current program execution”. See
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, RGL 05-06, Expired Regulatory Guidance Letters 23 (Dec. 7, 2005). RGL 92-04 and the other RGLs cited in this book are in the
category of RGLs listed in RGL 05-06 as “still generally applicable”. Id.

Research Problems
1. The Wilson family live just outside of Savannah, Georgia on a 5 acre lot. George and Martha
Wilson would like to build a pond in a wet portion of their back yard to attract birds and other
wildlife. Unfortunately, in order to construct the pond, they will be placing fill material in the
wetlands on their property. The company that will be building the pond has indicated that the
construction will likely impact about 1 acre of wetlands and the surface area of the pond will be
about 2 acres. Before the Wilsons begin work on the pond, they have sought your advice regarding
whether they need to apply for an individual Section 404 permit or whether a national or regional
general permit might authorize their project. Assuming that the wetlands are jurisdictional waters of
the United States, please advise them accordingly. In addition, if the construction of the pond may
be authorized by a general permit, please advise them whether they need to notify the Corps of
Engineers before they begin the project and whether they will need to provide any compensatory
mitigation for the impacts to the wetlands.
2. The Mitchell family would like to build a new ocean-front home in Florida. Construction of the
foundation and building pad for the home will require an addition of fill material into tidal wetlands.
Can the Mitchell’s rely on a nationwide general permit to authorize the construction of their new
home? If so, do they need to notify the Corps of Engineers before they begin construction?

C.

Similar in Nature / Minimal Environmental Effects

There are limits on the activities that the Corps can authorize through general permits. The
Clean Water Act allows the agency to issue general permits for categories of activities
involving discharge of dredged or fill material if the agency determines that the activities in
such category are similar in nature, will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects
when performed separately, and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the
environment. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(e)(1).

429 F.3d 493 (4th Cir. 2005)
LUTTIG, Circuit Judge

This case presents the question whether the United States Army Corps of Engineers ("the
Corps") exceeded its authority under the Clean Water Act ("CWA") when it promulgated
Nationwide Permit 21 ("NWP 21"), a general permit for the discharge of dredged or fill
material into the waters of the United States that allows projects to proceed only after
receiving individualized authorization from the Corps. We conclude that the Corps complied
with the CWA when it promulgated NWP 21. The contrary judgment of the district court is
therefore vacated.
I
***
The Army Corps of Engineers has authority under the CWA to issue two types of permits
for the discharge of dredged or fill material: individual permits and general permits. The
Corps issues individual permits under section 404(a) on a case-by-case basis for
discharges at "specified disposal sites," after providing notice and opportunity for public
hearing. Id. § 1344(a). The Corps issues general permits, which authorize "categories of
activities" rather than individual projects, under section 404(e). * * *
Pursuant to section 404(e), the Corps has promulgated a number of general permits, all but
one of which authorize projects that comply with the permits' terms to proceed without prior
approval by the Corps. The exception, NWP 21 - which authorizes discharges of dredged
or fill material associated with surface coal mining and reclamation projects - requires that
projects be individually authorized by the Corps. NWP 21 authorizes:
discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. associated with surface
coal mining and reclamation operations provided the coal mining activities are
authorized by the DOI, Office of Surface Mining (OSM), or by states with approved
programs under Title V of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977
and provided the permittee notifies the District Engineer in accordance with the
"Notification" General Condition. In addition, to be authorized by this NWP, the
District Engineer must determine that the activity complies with the terms and
228

conditions of the NWP and that the adverse environmental effects are minimal both
individually and cumulatively and must notify the project sponsor of this
determination in writing.
Issuance of Nationwide Permits, 67 Fed.Reg.2020, 2081 (Jan. 15, 2002).
In this litigation, plaintiffs, a coalition of environmental groups, have raised various
challenges to NWP 21. The district court did not reach most of those challenges, holding
simply that NWP 21 is facially invalid under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), because it conflicts with the unambiguous
meaning of section 404(e). * * * The district court accordingly suspended existing
authorizations under NWP 21 and enjoined the Corps from issuing further NWP 21
authorizations in the Southern District of West Virginia. * * * This appeal followed.
II
The district court concluded that NWP 21 conflicts with the unambiguous meaning of
section 404(e) for essentially four reasons. First, it concluded that NWP 21 "defines a
procedure instead of permitting a category of activities." * * * Second, it concluded that
section 404(e) "unambiguously requires determination of minimal impact before, not after,
the issuance of a nationwide permit," and that, in violation of this requirement, "NWP 21
provides for a post hoc, case-by-case evaluation of environmental impact." * * * [The
district court also concluded that the procedure used by the agency was inadequate and
that a condition included in the permit was in excess of the agency’s jurisdiction.] None of
these conclusions withstands scrutiny. * * *
A
The district court first concluded that NWP 21 fails to comply with section 404(e) because it
"defines a procedure instead of permitting a category of activities." * * * We disagree. NWP
21 plainly authorizes a "category of activities." The category of activities authorized by NWP
21 consists of those discharges of dredged or fill material that (1) are associated with
surface coal mining and reclamation operations, so long as those operations are authorized
by the Department of Interior or by states with approved programs under the Surface
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, (2) are preceded by notice to the Corps, and
(3) are approved by the Corps after the Corps concludes that the activity complies with the
terms of NWP 21 and that its adverse environmental effects are minimal both individually
and cumulatively. * * *
The district court erroneously reasoned that NWP 21 does not authorize a "category of
activities" because it is defined by procedural requirements "rather than objective
requirements or standards." * * * ("NWP 21 imposes no limit on the number of linear feet of
a stream, for example, that might be impacted by a valley fill or surface impoundment. It
229

does not limit the total acreage of a watershed that might be impacted."). As an initial
matter, we note that, by virtue of its incorporation of the requirements of the Surface Mining
Control and Reclamation Act ("SMCRA"), NWP 21 does contain substantive requirements.1
More importantly, nothing in section 404(e) or in logic prohibits, much less unambiguously
prohibits, the use of procedural, in addition to substantive, parameters to define a
"category." The district court therefore erred when it concluded that NWP 21 does not
define a "category of activities." * * *
B
The district court next concluded that NWP 21 violates the unambiguous terms of section
404(e) because it allows the Corps to defer the statutorily-required minimal-environmentalimpact determinations until after issuance of the nationwide permit. * * * 3 Section 404(e)
allows the Corps to issue a general permit only "if [it] determines ... that the activities in [the
subject] category ... will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed
separately, and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment." 33
U.S.C. § 1344(e). The district court concluded that the Corps did not make the required
minimal-impact determinations before issuing NWP 21, but instead opted to make those
determinations on a case-by-case basis after issuance of the permit. * * *
It is clear from the record before us that the Corps did make the required minimal-impact
determinations before it issued NWP 21. * * * The Decision Document for NWP 21 and the
supplement to that document, set forth at pages 469-512 of the Joint Appendix, contain the
Corps' pre-issuance analysis of the anticipated environmental impact of the activities
authorized by NWP 21. * * * The Corps' impact analysis took account of a variety of
1

SMCRA imposes a host of "performance standards" on "all surface coal mining and
reclamation operations." 30 U.S.C. § 1265(b). For example, under SMCRA, all surface coal
mining operations must "minimize the disturbances to the prevailing hydrologic balance at
the mine-site and in associated offsite areas and to the quality and quantity of water in
surface and ground water systems both during and after surface coal mining operations
and during reclamation." Id. § 1265(b)(10).
3

The Corps argues that section 404(e) does not unambiguously require that the minimalimpact determinations be made before issuance of a nationwide permit. The Corps
believes that the statute allows it to issue a nationwide permit so long as it makes the
minimal-impact determinations before the permit is actually used to authorize discharges,
even if after issuance of the permit. At the very least, the Corps argues, section 404(e)'s
minimal impact determination requirement is temporally ambiguous, and the Corps' reading
is a permissible construction entitled to Chevron deference. Because we conclude that the
Corps made the required minimal-impact determinations before issuing NWP 21, we do not
reach these contentions.
230

factors, including public commentators' opinions, * * * NWP 21's incorporation of SMCRA's
requirements, * * * the nature of the coal-mining activities authorized by NWP 21, * * * the
applicability of a variety of General Conditions to NWP 21, * * * and data about usage of
previous versions of NWP 21 * * * Based on these considerations and others, the Corps
concluded that the activities authorized by NWP 21 "will not result in significant degradation
of the aquatic environment." * * * This determination was sufficient to meet the
requirements of section 404(e).
The district court held that the Corps did not satisfy section 404(e) because it did not
provide an ex ante guarantee that the activities authorized by NWP 21 would have only a
minimal impact. The district court reasoned that, under section 404(e), "[t]he issuance of a
nationwide permit ... functions as a guarantee ab initio that every instance of the permitted
activity will meet the minimal impact standard," and that, by permitting the Corps to engage
in "post hoc, case-by-case evaluation of environmental impact," NWP 21 "runs afoul of the
statutory requirement of initial certainty." * * *
The district court erred. It is simply not the case that issuance of a general permit functions
as a guarantee ab initio that every instance of the permitted activity will have only a minimal
impact. * * *
For two reasons, we do not believe that an interpretation of section 404(e) that would
require initial certainty is tenable. First, section 404(e)(2) gives the Corps authority to
revoke or modify a general permit if, after issuing the permit, it "determines that the
activities authorized by such general permit have an adverse impact on the environment."
33 U.S.C. § 1344(e)(2). This provision demonstrates that Congress anticipated that the
Corps would make its initial minimal-impact determinations under conditions of uncertainty
and that those determinations would therefore sometimes be inaccurate, resulting in
general permits that authorize activities with more-than-minimal impacts. It also
demonstrates that Congress expected that the Corps would engage in post-issuance
policing of the activities authorized by general permits in order to ensure that their
environmental impacts are minimal. * * *
Second, it is impossible for the Corps' ex ante determinations of minimal impact to be
anything more than reasoned predictions. Even under the paradigmatic general permit
envisioned by the district court, where the parameters of the authorized activities are
delineated in objective, measurable terms, the Corps' minimal-impact determinations would
necessarily be a forecast only. This is so because the environmental impact of the activities
authorized by a general permit depends on factors that, as a practical matter, are outside
the Corps' ability to predict with certainty ex ante. This uncertainty is especially acute when
the Corps issues a nationwide permit like NWP 21 because the Corps must attempt to
forecast the environmental effects the authorized activities could have if undertaken
anywhere in the country under any set of circumstances. * * *

231

Nor can we agree with the district court's implicit conclusion that the Corps may not rely on
the availability of post-issuance procedures, such as NWP 21's requirement of postissuance individualized authorization, when it makes its pre-issuance minimal-impact
determinations. * * * The statute is silent on the question whether the Corps may make its
pre-issuance minimal impact determinations by relying in part on the fact that its postissuance procedures will ensure that the authorized projects will have only minimal impacts.
We must therefore defer to the Corps' conclusion that it may do so if that conclusion is
permissible in light of the statutory language and is reasonable. It is both. * * *
In concluding that section 404(e) permits the Corps to rely in part on post-issuance
procedures to make its pre-issuance minimal-impact determinations, we do not suggest
that section 404(e) permits the Corps completely to defer the minimal-impact
determinations until after issuance of the permit. We would have substantial doubts about
the Corps' ability to issue a nationwide permit that relied solely on post-issuance, case-bycase determinations of minimal impact, with no general pre-issuance determinations. In
such a case, the Corps' "determinations" would consist of little more than its own promise
to obey the law. * * *
However, we are satisfied, based on our review of the Corps' decision document, that the
Corps did actually make, in advance, the minimal-impact determinations required by the
statute. It made those determinations after undertaking a good-faith, comprehensive, preissuance review of the anticipated environmental effects of the activities authorized by
NWP 21, and its partial reliance on post-issuance procedures to ensure minimal impacts
did not make those determinations any less valid. * * *
In sum, we conclude that the Corps complied with section 404(e) when it issued NWP 21.
* * * The contrary judgment of the district court and the injunction against NWP 21
authorizations are vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
Questions and Comments
1.

Categories of activities that are similar in nature / scope and conditions: Are
there limits on the breadth of the categories of activities that can be regulated
through a general permit? In the case above, NWP 21 authorized discharges of
dredged or fill material associated with surface coal mining and reclamation
activities if the discharges were authorized under the Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act. While that category seems quite broad, the Corps narrowed it by
limiting authorization to discharges when the discharger notifies the Corps that it
plans to discharge under the permit and the Corps affirmatively authorizes the
discharge, after reviewing the potential environmental effects of the discharge.
Would the permit have sufficiently identified a category of activities that are similar in
nature without the notification and approval procedures? What concerns are raised if
232

the category of activities is defined too broadly? While courts have frequently upheld
the authorization of fairly broad categories of activities under general permits, they
usually have done so after concluding that the conditions in the permit sufficiently
narrow the categories so that they are “similar in nature.” In addition to the instant
case, see Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 508 F.3d 1332 (11th Cir.
2007) (upholding a general permit to cover “suburban development” activities over a
48,000 acre area based on the limiting conditions in the permit, but recognizing
concerns about circumvention of the notice and public hearing requirements that
would apply to individual permitting); Alaska Center for the Environment v. West,
157 F.3d 680 (9th Cir. 1998) (upholding a general permit that authorized discharges
associated with construction of “residential buildings” and a broad range of other
activities in the City of Anchorage based on the limiting conditions in the permit).
Prior to 1996, one of the most widely used nationwide permits that the Corps issued
was NWP 26, which authorized a broad range of activities in waters above
headwaters and in isolated waters. Many critics argued that the activities authorized
by that permit were not “similar in nature,” and the Corps replaced the permit with a
series of permits that addressed more narrowly tailored categories of activities. See
61 Fed. Reg. 65874 (Dec. 13, 1996).
2.

Statutory / regulatory definition of “similar in nature”: Does “similar in nature”
refer to the nature of the projects, the nature of the effects, or both? Does the
statute define “similar in nature”? The 404(b)(1) guidelines (regulations) limit the
issuance of general permits to categories of activities where the activities are similar
in nature and similar in their impact on water quality and the aquatic environment.
See 40 C.F.R. § 230.7(a) If the statute is silent and there is a regulation that
interprets the statutory language, how does that impact judicial review of the
language? See Alaska Center for the Environment v. West, 157 F.3d 680 (9th Cir.
1998) (upholding Corps determination that a broad range of activities authorized by
the general permit were “similar in nature” because they would have similar impacts,
when limited by the conditions in the permit).

3.

Documentation: The 404(b)(1) guidelines require the Corps to prepare a written
evaluation of the individual and cumulative impacts of the activities that will be
authorized by a general permit, to demonstrate that they will be minimal, and an
explanation of why the activities to be authorized are “similar in nature” before the
agency issues the permit. See 40 C.F.R. § 230.7(b).

4.

Minimal impacts: In a footnote, in Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition v. Bulen, the
court indicated that it would not reach the Corps’ contention that the Clean Water
Act authorized the Corps to make the minimal impact determination for a general
permit after the permit is issued, as long as the determination is made before the
permit is used. If the court does not “reach the contentions”, does it provide some
233

guidance regarding whether the Corps’ interpretation of the statute is reasonable?
5.

Post-issuance review: As noted above, many of the nationwide permits issued by
the Corps of Engineers include a “pre-construction notification” requirement, so that
persons who intend to take actions authorized by the permit must notify the Corps
prior to undertaking those actions. In most cases, if the actor provides that notice
and the Corps does not notify them within 45 days that they can’t proceed with their
activity, they can undertake the activity authorized by the permit even though the
Corps did not respond to their notice. See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2012
Nationwide Permits, Conditions, District Engineer’s Decision, Further Information,
and Definitions (with corrections) General Condition 31. In the Ohio Valley
Environmental Coalition v. Bulen case, above, the presumption was reversed for
NWP 21, so that persons could not undertake activities under the permit until the
Corps affirmatively authorized the activities.

6.

Should nationwide and other general permits include more stringent limits on the
total acreage of wetlands that can be filled under those permits? See Steven G.
Davison, General Permits Under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 26 Pace Envtl.
L. Rev. 35 (2009).

D.

Combining permits

In light of the fact that the Corps has issued many general permits on a national, regional,
or State-wide basis, questions arise regarding whether a landowner can rely on (1) a
combination of general permits; (2) multiple uses of a single general permit; or (3) a
combination of general permits and individual permits to authorize discharges of dredged or
fill material.
In situations where a project would require an individual Section 404 permit, the permittee
may be able to undertake a portion of the project through a general permit while the Corps
is processing the individual permit application but only if the portion of the project that
would be authorized by the general permit “would have independent utility” and would be
“able to function or meet [its] purpose independent of the total project.” See 33 C.F.R. §
330.6(d).
For situations where a developer would like to rely on multiple general permits, rather than
an individual permit, to authorize a project, the Corps allows persons to combine two or
more different nationwide permits, but only if they are being combined to authorize a “single
and complete project.” Id. § 330.6(c). If the activities being authorized by the combination of
general permits are really only part of a larger project and do not have “independent utility”,
they are not a “single and complete project” and the Corps’ regulations do not allow
developers to combine general permits to authorize the activities. See Crutchfield v. County
of Hanover, Virginia, 325 F.3d 211 (4th Cir. 2003). Similarly, the Corps’ regulations prohibit
234

multiple use of the same nationwide permit on a “single and complete project.” See 33
C.F.R. § 330.6(c). The limits that the Corps places on the use of multiple general permits
are designed to prevent developers from evading the individual permit requirement for a
project by segmenting the project into a lot of smaller activities which could qualify for
general permits. See Crutchfield v. County of Hanover, Virginia, 325 F.3d 211 (4th Cir.
2003).

Individual Permits

As noted above, most development activities in wetlands are authorized through general
permits, rather than individual permits. Less than 5% of the projects authorized by the
Corps each year are authorized through individual permits. See Royal C. Gardner,
Lawyers, Swamps, and Money 102 (Island Press, 2011). Although the individual permit
process is longer and more expensive than the general permit process, in most cases, the
Corps will issue a permit at the end of the process. In 2007 and 2008, while the Corps
evaluated more than 150,000 development activities for authorization under individual or
general permits, it denied fewer than 750 individual permit applications (less than 1%). Id.
That permit denial rate has remained fairly constant over the years. For instance, in 1981,
the Corps denied 2.7% of the individual permit applications. See U.S. Congress, Office of
Technology Assessment, OTA-O-206, Wetlands: Their Use and Regulation 143-144 (Mar.
1984). Once issued, individual permits generally authorize permittees to leave dredged or
235

fill material in wetlands indefinitely, see 33 C.F.R. § 325.6, but the Corps has the authority
to modify, suspend or revoke the permits as “necessary by considerations of the public
interest. Id. § 325.7.
A.

The Process

The Corps of Engineers reviews and issues
or denies individual Section 404 permits
through an informal process that involves
public participation and review by EPA and
other federal and state agencies. In most
cases, the decision whether to issue or deny
the permit will be made at the district level,
by the District Engineer. See 33 C.F.R. §
325.2(a)(6). While the Corps administers the
Section 404 permit program, EPA plays an
important role as well. In addition to
reviewing and commenting on the individual
permit applications, EPA, in consultation with
the Corps, wrote the rules (the Section
404(b)(1) guidelines) that the Corps uses to
determine whether to issue or deny permits
and EPA has the authority to veto the Corps’
permits. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(c) (discussed
in Chapter 8, infra).

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act provides that the Corps “may issue permits, after notice
and opportunity for public hearings for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the
navigable waters at specified disposal sites.” See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(a). The Corps has
interpreted that language to authorize it to issue permits through an informal process,
rather than through the formal adjudication procedures of the Administrative Procedures
Act, and courts have upheld that interpretation. See Buttrey v. United States, 690 F.2d
1170 (5th Cir. 1982). The Corps’ regulations that address the Section 404 permit process
are codified at 33 C.F.R. Part 325.

236

1.

Application, public notice and comment

The Corps encourages, but does not require, permit applicants who are proposing major
projects to meet with the agency before filing their application for a brief pre-application
consultation. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.1(b). After an applicant files a complete application and
pays the application fee (ranging from $10 - $100), the Corps issues a public notice of the
permit application and invites public comment on the application. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.3.
The notice is posted online, in the post office or other public buildings in the area, sent to
the applicant, adjoining property owners, appropriate federal, state and local agencies, the
news media, and a variety of other interested parties and includes information outlined in
the regulations that is “sufficient ... to give a clear understanding of the nature and
magnitude of the activity to generate meaningful comment.” Id. § 325.3(a).
The Corps normally provides for a 30 day public comment period and consults with EPA,
the Fish and Wildlife Service, and several other agencies during this comment period to
comply with other federal laws, as described below. All of the comments that the Corps
receives from the public or other agencies are included in the administrative record for the
agency’s ultimate decision and the agency provides the applicant with an opportunity to
provide additional information in response to those comments. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(a)(3).
2.

Coordination with other agencies

In light of its authority to veto section 404 permits, see Chapter 8, infra, and its authority to
bring enforcement actions for illegal discharges of dredged or fill material, see Chapter 10,
infra, EPA is involved in the review and commenting process for Section 404 permits at an
early stage. As the primary author of the Section 404(b)(1) guidelines, the standards that
the Corps will use to evaluate the permit, EPA can provide vital comments regarding
whether an application complies with those standards. The Fish and Wildlife Service also
provides comments based on its authority under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act and
the Endangered Species Act, discussed infra, and the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), within the Department of Commerce provides
comments on permits based on authority in the Endangered Species Act and Coastal Zone
Management Act, discussed infra. The Corps has entered into Memoranda of Agreement
with EPA, see Memorandum of Agreement Between the Environmental Protection Agency
and the Department of the Army, Section 404(q) (August 11, 1992), the Fish and Wildlife
Service, see Memorandum of Agreement Between the Department of the Interior and the
Department of the Army, Section 404(q) (December 21, 1992) and NOAA, see
Memorandum of Agreement Between the Department of Commerce and the Department of
the Army, Section 404(q) (December 21, 1992) to coordinate their involvement in the
review of permits and to minimize delays in processing the permits, as required by the
statute. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(q). While the Corps consults with EPA, the Fish and Wildlife
Service, and NOAA as part of the permit review process, the Corps retains the ultimately
authority to decide whether to issue or deny the Section 404 permit. See U.S. Army Corps
237

of Engineers, RGL 92-01, Federal Agencies Roles and Responsibilities (May 12, 1992).
Many of those agencies, as well as states and other federal agencies, consult or comment
during the permit process because the Corps’ decision to issue or deny a Section 404
permit triggers provisions of other statutes or other provisions of the Clean Water Act.
For instance, Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. §
1536(a)(2), requires federal agencies to insure that actions that they authorize, such as
through the issuance of a Section 404 permit, are not likely to “jeopardize ... endangered ...
or threatened species” or destroy or adversely modify their critical habitat. The ESA
requires federal agencies to follow specific procedures to consult with the Fish and Wildlife
Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service within NOAA (for marine species) to
ensure that the agencies’ actions don’t violate Section 7. Id. § 1536(a); 50 C.F.R. Part 402,
Subpart B (Department of Interior’s regulations). Accordingly, when the Corps receives a
section 404 permit application, it reviews the application and, if the proposed activity may
affect endangered or threatened species, it begins the consultation process required by the
ESA. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(b)(5). As part of the formal consultation process, the Fish and
Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service will prepare an environmental
study called a biological opinion that evaluates whether the proposed activity will jeopardize
the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species. See 50 C.F.R. § 402.14.
If the Corps ultimately concludes that the activity proposed in a permit will jeopardize and
endangered or threatened species or destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat, the
agency must deny the permit.
The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451 et seq., also limits the
Corps authority to issue Section 404 permits. If a state has an approved coastal zone
management program under the CZMA, the Corps cannot issue a permit for an activity that
affects the coastal zone unless the state certifies that the proposed activity complies with
the state’s program. Id. § 1456(c)(3). When the Corps receives a permit application for such
an activity, the applicant must include a certification that the activity complies with the
state’s coastal zone management program. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(b)(2). The Corps
forwards that certification to the state for concurrence. Id. If the state objects, the Corps
cannot issue the permit. Id. On the other hand, if the state concurs or fails to object within
six months, the Corps can issue the permit. Id.
The NEPA and Clean Water Act Section 401 certification requirements discussed in the
section above regarding general permits also apply to the Corps’ evaluation of individual
permits. Thus, when the Corps receives a Section 404 permit application, it will prepare
either an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, depending on
the magnitude of the impacts of the activities authorized by the permit, as part of the
permitting process. See 33 C.F.R. Part 325, App. B. NEPA requires public involvement in
the preparation of those documents, so the Corps provides notice and appropriate
opportunities to comment on the EA or EIS as part of the Section 404 permit review
238

process. Id. NEPA is a procedural statute and does not require agencies to take actions
that have the least harmful impacts on the environment, so, as long as the Corps prepares
the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement in accordance with the
procedures and requirements of NEPA, the agency can issue or deny the Section 404
permit without further restrictions from NEPA.
In order to comply with the Clean Water Act Section 401 certification requirements, the
Corps asks the applicant to submit the certification (that the discharge won’t violate state
water quality standards) from the State where the discharge will occur as part of the
application. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(b)(1). If the applicant does not provide the certification,
the Corps seeks the certification from the State. Id. If, after the Corps issues the initial
public notice for a permit application, EPA determines that additional states need to provide
Section 401 certification, EPA will notify those states. Id. As noted above, in response to a
request for certification, states can agree to the certification or they can object to the
certification and seek to have conditions imposed on the discharge. The Corps cannot
issue a Section 404 permit until states issue the 401 certification or waive their right to do
so, by failing to act on a request for certification within 60 days. Id.
3.

Hearings and Decision-making

Unless the other federal laws outlined above require a hearing because of the nature of a
particular permit application, the Corps’ regulations give the district engineers discretion to
decide whether it is necessary to hold a public hearing on a Section 404 permit application.
Id. § 325.2(a)(5). Few hearings are held, even though the Corps’ regulations provide that
the agency will hold a public hearing whenever any person requests a hearing during the
comment period, unless the agency determines “that the issues raised are insubstantial or
there is otherwise no valid interest to be served by a hearing.” Id. § 327.4(b). When the
Corps holds a hearing on a permit application, it is not a formal trial-type hearing. The
district engineer is usually the presiding officer at the hearing and any person may present
oral or written testimony at the hearing and call witnesses to present statements, but there
is no cross-examination of witnesses. See 33 C.F.R. Part 327.
When the Corps has completed its review of the permit application under the Clean Water
Act standards discussed in the next section and has completed the consultation and review
required by the laws outlined above, the agency will issue or deny the permit, or issue it
with conditions. If the Corps issues a permit before other agencies have completed their
review of the activities authorized by the permit, the Corps will normally condition the permit
on approval by the other agencies. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(d)(4). When the Corps makes a
final decision on the permit application, it supports the decision with a written statement of
findings or record of decision (if an EIS was prepared), which explains the basis for the
agency’s decision. Id. § 325.2(b)(6).
If the Corps denies a permit application or includes conditions in the permit that lead the
239

applicant to decline the permit, the applicant, but no third party, can appeal the Corps’
permit decision administratively. See 33 C.F.R. § 331.6. The administrative process is
described in Chapter 10 of this book. Permit applicants must appeal the Corps’ decision
through those administrative processes before they can appeal the decision in court. Id. §
331.12. Since the administrative appeal process is only available to permit applicants,
anyone else who wants to challenge the Corps’ decision to issue, condition, or deny a
Section 404 permit must challenge it in court. Chapter 10 of this book explores the judicial
review and citizen suit provisions of the Clean Water Act in detail.
Questions and Comments
1.

Timing: The Corps’ permit regulations require the Corps to make a determination
regarding whether a permit application is complete within 15 days after receiving the
application, and require the Corps to make a decision on a permit application within
60 days after the agency determines that the application is complete, unless specific
conditions identified in the regulation are met. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.2. Not
surprisingly, the process normally takes longer than that. Although the authors of a
2002 study claimed that it took, on average, about 788 days to process an individual
Section 404 permit, see Sunding & Zilberman, supra, at 74, the Corps indicates that
it took, on average, about 221 days to process individual permits in 2010. See U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Reissuance of Nationwide Permits, 77 Fed. Reg. 10184,
10190 (Feb. 21, 2012).

2.

The rest of the story re: permit denials: Although the Corps denies a very small
percentage of individual Section 404 permit applications each year, many permit
applications are withdrawn before the Corps makes a decision on the permit, and
many permits include conditions that the applicant did not originally propose or
might prefer were not included. In 2007 and 2008, for instance, 14% of permit
applications were withdrawn. See Royal C. Gardner, Lawyers, Swamps, and Money
102 (Island Press, 2011).

3.

NEPA Issues: As will be discussed in the next section, when a landowner receives
a permit to discharge dredged or fill material into wetlands (or other waters of the
United States), the Corps frequently requires the permittee to create, restore,
enhance, or preserve other wetlands to mitigate the environmental harm caused by
the discharge. When the Corps is determining whether the effects of a discharge
authorized by a permit are significant enough to require the preparation of an
environmental impact statement, the Corps often focuses on the net effects of the
discharge when considering any mitigation that will take place as part of the permit,
rather than simply focusing on the environmental effects of the discharge itself. By
doing this, the adverse impacts are often reduced to a level where they are not
significant, so the Corps can issue a FONSI. Although environmental groups have
criticized this approach, the Council on Environmental Quality has issued guidance
240

that authorizes “mitigated FONSIs” if the mitigation is enforceable and monitored.
See Nancy Sutley, Chair, Council on Environmental Quality, Memorandum for
Heads of Federal Departments and Agencies, Appropriate Use of Mitigation and
Clarifying the Appropriate Use of Mitigated Findings of No Significant Impact (Jan.
14, 2011).
Another issue that arises with regard to NEPA is the scope of the project to be
reviewed under NEPA. If a project will involve a discharge of dredged or fill material
into waters of the United States but also includes development of uplands, the
Corps normally only evaluates the portions of the project that take place in waters of
the United States as part of the environmental review under NEPA. See 33 C.F.R.
Part 325, App. B, § 7. The Corps’ approach has been upheld by the Ninth Circuit.
See Sylvester v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 871 F.2d 817 (9th Cir. 1989),
revised at 884 F.2d 394 (9th Cir. 1989).
4.

Compliance with other laws: In addition to the laws outlined above, the Corps
must also comply with the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 470 et
seq., when issuing a Section 404 permit. The Corps’ regulations establish a process
for review and consultation to comply with the statute as part of the 404 permit
process. See .33 C.F.R. Part 325, App. C,

5.

Surface coal mining: In light of all the controversy surrounding the Corps’ issuance
of permits for valley fills from mountaintop removal mining, the Corps, EPA and the
Fish and Wildlife Service entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in 2005 to
coordinate review of such permits. See Memorandum of Understanding for the
Purpose of Providing Concurrent and Coordinated Review and Processing of
Surface Coal Mining Applications Proposing Placement of Dredged and/or Fill
Material in Waters of the United States (Feb. 10, 2005).

6.

The hearing requirement: What is the standard of review that courts will apply
when the Corps determines that it is not necessary to hold a public hearing for a
Section 404 permit? See Friends of the Payette v. Horseshoe Bend Hydroelectric
Co., 988 F.2d 989 (9th Cir. 1993).
When the Corps holds a hearing for Section 404 permits, it holds an informal
hearing. Does due process require a more formal hearing than the hearing provided
by the Corps as part of the Section 404 permit process? Does due process require
that the Corps provide that hearing for every permit decision? See AJA Associates
v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 817 F.2d 1070 (3d Cir. 1987); Buttrey v. United
States, 690 F.2d 1170 (5th Cir. 1982).

7.

After the fact permits: The Corps’ regulations authorize the agency, in limited
circumstances, to issue “after the fact” permits for activities that have already taken
241

place. See 33 C.F.R. § 326.3(e). The agency uses this as an enforcement tool, and
the permittee must follow the normal permit application procedures. Id.
Research Problems
Pending or final permits: The Corps provides, on the website of the Corps’
headquarters, a searchable list of individual Section 404 permits issued by the
agency and pending individual permit applications. The list does not, however,
include links to the actual permits, which are available from the district offices. In
addition, the Regulatory sections of the Corps district offices usually post public
notices of pending permit applications on their websites. Although the notices do not
usually include the permit application, they provide more information than is available
for pending applications on the Corps’ headquarters website. Relying on those
sources, answer the following questions:
1. How many individual Section 404 permits and letters of permission were issued by
the Sacramento District of the Corps in February, 2014? What activity was authorized
by the permit issued to Scott Murphy and the City of Montrose?
2. What is the website address where you will find public notices of pending Section
404 permit applications in the Seattle, Washington area? If you can find a pending
permit application, please identify the applicant and indicate when the comment
period for that notice expires.

B.

The Standards for Permit Review

The primary standards that the Corps of Engineers uses to evaluate whether to issue or
deny a Section 404 permit, or the conditions to include in a Section 404 permit are the
Section 404(b)(1) guidelines. See 40 C.F.R. Part 230. However, when evaluating Section
404 permit applications, the Corps also conducts a public interest review.
1.

Public Interest Review

Although it is not explicitly required by the Clean Water Act, the Corps conducts a “public
interest review” of each Section 404 permit application (and Rivers and Harbors Act section
10 permit application). Pursuant to its regulations, the Corps evaluates “the probable
impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity and its intended use on the
public interest.” See 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a). The factors that the Corps considers as part of
its public interest review include:
242

Conservation

Economics

Aesthetics

General Environmental
Concerns

Wetlands

Historic Properties

Fish and Wildlife Values

Flood Hazards

Floodplain Values

Land Use

Navigation

Shore Erosion

Recreation

Water Supply and
Conservation

Water Quality

Mineral Needs

Considerations of Property
Ownership

The Needs and Welfare of
the People

Id.
Because the review includes such a broad range of factors, it has been criticized as
“virtually standardless”. See Royal C. Gardner, Lawyers, Swamps, and Money 75 (Island
Press, 2011).
For purposes of the public interest review, the regulations create a presumption in favor of
granting the permit, providing that “a permit will be granted unless the [Corps] determines
that it would be contrary to the public interest.” See 33 C.F.R. § 320.4(a). However, the
regulations also provide that the Corps should not issue permits to alter “important”
wetlands unless the Corps determines that the benefits of alteration outweigh the damage
to the wetlands. Id. While the Corps evaluates Section 404 permit applications under the
public interest review, as a practical matter, the agency never denies a permit based on the
public interest review alone. See Royal C. Gardner, Lawyers, Swamps, and Money 75
(Island Press, 2011). The primary standards for review of Section 404 permit applications
are the 404(b)(1) guidelines.
2.

Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines

Resource
Corps Video on the 404(b)(1) Guidelines

The Clean Water Act authorizes the Corps of
Engineers to issue permits for discharge of
dredged or fill material “through the
application of guidelines developed by the
Administrator, in conjunction with the Secretary ...” See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(b)(1). Although
they are called the 404(b)(1) guidelines, the “guidelines” are binding legislative rules,
which were issued through the notice and comment rulemaking process, see 45 Fed. Reg.
85336 (Dec. 24, 1980), and are codified at 40 C.F.R. Part 230.
243

The guidelines place four major restrictions on discharges of dredged or fill material.
First, they prohibit discharges if there is “a practicable alternative to the proposed
discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem.” See 40 C.F.R.
§ 230.10(a).
Second, they prohibit discharges that violate or contribute to violation of several other
listed provisions of the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and the National Marine
Sanctuaries Act. Id. § 230.10(b).
Third, they prohibit discharges that will “cause or contribute to significant degradation of
the waters of the United States.” Id. § 230.10(c).
Fourth, they prohibit discharges unless “appropriate and practicable steps have been
taken which will minimize potential adverse impacts ... on the aquatic ecosystem.” Id. §
230.10(d).
If a discharge violates any one of those requirements, the Corps will deny the permit for the
discharge or condition the permit so that the discharge will not violate the requirements.
The fourth restriction identified above is the basis for the mitigation requirements that are
included in Section 404 permits and will be explored at length in Chapter 7 of this book.
Regarding the third restriction, the guidelines provide further elaboration on the meaning of
“significant degradation”, see 33 C.F.R.. § 230.11, but courts have rarely overturned
Section 404 permits on the grounds that the permit would cause or contribute to “significant
degradation.” See Margaret Strand, Wetlands Deskbook 90 (Environmental Law institute,
3d ed., 2009) The second restriction identified above is rather straightforward and is
designed to ensure that the activities authorized by the Corps do not violate specific
environmental standards that are frequently implicated by the discharge of dredged or fill
material. Consequently, the remainder of this chapter will focus on the practicable
alternatives restriction in the 404(b)(1) guidelines.

or fill material if there is “a practicable
alternative to the proposed discharge
which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem.” See 40 C.F.R. §
230.10(a). An alternative is a “practicable” alternative if “it is available and capable of
being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology and logistics in light of
the overall project purpose.” Id. § 230.10(a)(2). Thus, when the Corps evaluates a Section
244

404 permit application, it focuses, in part, on whether the permit applicant could proceed
with the proposed project on other land or in a different manner on the same land in a way
that would have a less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem. If there is a practicable
alternative with less adverse impacts, the Corps must deny the permit. For instance, taking
a very simplified example, if a developer owns two parcels of land adjacent to a major
highway, only one of which has wetlands on it, and the developer seeks a Section 404
permit to build a shopping mall on the parcel of land with the wetlands, but could build the
mall on the other parcel (considering cost and the project purpose), the Corps should deny
the permit to the developer since construction on the other parcel is a practicable
alternative that would have a less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem.
The guidelines also establish two presumptions regarding practicable alternatives when
the activity to be permitted involves a discharge into a “special aquatic site” (which, per the
guidelines, includes wetlands, see 40 C.F.R. § 230.41.
First, if an activity to be permitted is not waterdependent (does not require access or proximity to or
siting within the special aquatic site to fulfill its basic
purpose), the guidelines presume that practicable
alternatives exist that do not involve special
aquatic sites, “unless clearly demonstrated
otherwise.” See 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(a)(3). Thus, while
a dock would be water-dependent, a golf course would
generally not be water-dependent. Accordingly, in the
permitting process, the golf course developer would
have the burden of demonstrating that there were no
practicable alternatives to constructing the golf course
in the location and manner proposed in the permit
application.
Second, for activities that involve discharges into Photo 32 By Bill Fitzpatrick (Own work)
special aquatic sites, the guidelines presume that any http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3
practicable alternatives to the proposed discharge AMunicipal_Golf_Course.jpg [CC-BY-SA3.0]
that do not involve special aquatic sites will have
less adverse impact on the aquatic environment, “unless clearly demonstrated
otherwise.” Id. Accordingly, if there was another location available where the golf course
developer in the last example could build the golf course without filling wetlands and the
location was a “practicable” alternative, the developer would have to rebut the presumption
that the alternative would have a less adverse impact on the aquatic environment before
the Corps could issue a Section 404 permit.

245

Project Purpose
One issue that has been the source of controversy over the years has been the
identification of the purpose of a project for which a Section 404 permit is being sought. If
the purpose is defined sufficiently narrowly, the range of alternatives that will achieve that
purpose and be considered “practicable” will be narrowed as well. Similarly, the manner in
which the project purpose is framed can greatly affect whether the project is considered
“water dependent.” As a result, for many years, disputes arose concerning whether the
project purpose was ultimately determined by the Corps or the applicant. The issue is
addressed (1) in the following case and (2) in the following memorandum issued by the
Corps in response to a request from EPA and the Department of Commerce to elevate a
permit dispute to the Corps’ headquarters for resolution. (Note: When EPA, FWS or NOAA
cannot resolve disputes with the Corps regarding Section 404 permit applications at the
regional level, the agencies have adopted a process, pursuant to Section 404(q) of the
Clean Water Act, to elevate those disputes to higher levels within the agencies for
resolution. The elevation process is described in detail in Chapter 8 of this book).

761 F.2d 1044 (5th Cir. 1985)
PER CURIAM:

Six environmental organizations object to the issuance by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers of six individual permits allowing private landowners to clear and convert to
agriculture approximately 5200 acres of bottomland hardwood wetlands. * * * As to the six
individual permits, we agree with the district court that the Corps properly followed both the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Environmental Protection Agency's
regulatory guidelines in making its determination. * * *
The district court opinion efficiently distilled a voluminous record and described in detail
* * * the physical characteristics of the six tracts affected by the permit applications. * * *
We, therefore, do not attempt to repeat the factual background of this case.
The six permits granted by the Corps authorize the agricultural conversion of 5200 acres of
wetlands. For environmental protection purposes, such wetlands are denominated "special
aquatic sites." * * * Both the Environmental Protection Agency's Guidelines and the Corps
of Engineers' regulations treat all special aquatic sites as worthy of extra protection, and
state as "[t]he guiding principle ... that degradation or destruction of special sites may
represent an irreversible loss of valuable aquatic resources." * * *

246

Such heightened solicitude for wetlands is manifest in the regulations stating the
considerations that must be taken into account when evaluating a proposed alteration to
wetlands acreage. When a discharge of dredged or fill material is proposed, the Corps'
Guidelines prohibit issuance of a permit if there is a "practicable alternative that would have
less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem...." * * * A "practicable alternative," in turn,
is defined as one that is, "available and capable of being done after taking into
consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes."
* * * With respect to wetlands, however, the Guidelines specify:
[w]here the activity associated with a discharge which is proposed for a special
aquatic site ... does not require access or proximity to or siting within the special
aquatic site in question to fulfill the basic purpose (i.e. is not 'water dependent'),
practicable alternatives that do not involve special aquatic sites are presumed to be
available, unless clearly demonstrated otherwise. * * *
"Thus, the guidelines couple a general presumption against all discharges into aquatic
ecosystems with a specific presumption that practicable alternatives to the fill of wetlands
exist." * * *
In each of the six permit-application proceedings, the Corps characterized the applicant's
basic purpose for the project as being, "to increase soybean production or to increase net
return on assets owned by the company." * * * It is undisputed that soybean production is
a non-water dependent activity. As shown above, this fact "necessitate[s] a more
persuasive showing than otherwise concerning the lack of alternatives." * * *
The environmental protection organizations argue on appeal that the applicants failed to
make the required showing, and that the Corps erroneously granted them permits by
interpreting "practicable alternatives" to mean "profit-maximizing alternatives." In addition,
they contend that the Corps erred in viewing the alternatives with the applicants' objectives
in mind instead of with an eye towards environmental maintenance. Both arguments must
be rejected. * * *
[The Court held that the Corps, in granting the permits, often approved an alternative that
was not “profit maximizing”, so the court rejected the environmental organizations initial
argument.]
The environmental protection organizations' second contention, that the alternatives may
not be viewed with the applicant's objectives in mind, is not substantiated by either case
law or the applicable regulations. As the district court recognized, the Preamble to the
Guidelines states, "... [w]e consider implicit that, to be practicable, an alternative must be
capable of achieving the best purpose of the proposed activity." * * * In turn, the text of the
Guidelines provides that an alternative is practicable if it is available and capable of being
done after taking into account costs, existing technology and logistics in light of the overall
247

project purposes. * * * Under these Guidelines, therefore, not only is it permissible for the
Corps to consider the applicant's objective; the Corps has a duty to take into account the
objectives of the applicant's project.* * * Indeed, it would be bizarre if the Corps were to
ignore the purpose for which the applicant seeks a permit and to substitute a purpose it
deems more suitable.
The case law, although sparse, is in accord with our conclusion. In Hough v. Marsh, supra,
residents of Edgartown, Massachusetts challenged a Corps permit authorizing the filling of
a coastal tract to construct two private homes and a tennis court. The District Engineer had
found that the project was not "water dependent," and undertook the requisite examination
to discover the existence of "practicable alternatives." The Engineer defined the basic
purpose of the project as "providing two homes and a tennis court." * * * Although the
district court remanded for the landowners to demonstrate more clearly that no practicable
alternatives to the proposed fill existed, the court did not question the Engineer's
formulation of the project's objective, and did not suggest that the alternatives were not
considered from the proper perspective. * * *
The district court's findings that the Corps properly analyzed all six permit applications and
correctly decided to grant permission to clear the tracts for agricultural use is amply
supported by the record. Nothing in it convinces us that the Corps' actions were arbitrary,
capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law, the sole standards by which we review
such actions.

Patrick Kelly, Brigadier General Memorandum Thru Commander, U.S. Army Engineer
Division, Lower Mississippi Valley For Commander, U.S. Army Engineer District, New
Orleans, Permit Elevation, Plantation Landing Resort, Inc. (Apr. 21, 1989)
* * * By memorandum dated 3 February 1989, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil
Works) advised me that he had granted the request of the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and the Department of Commerce (DOC) to elevate the permit case for
Plantation Landing Resort, Inc., to HQUSACE for national policy level review concerning
the practicable alternatives and mitigation provisions of the 404(b)(1) Guidelines. My review
of the case record * * * leads me to conclude that Corps policy * * * should be clarified in
certain respects. * * *

248

Please re-evaluate the subject permit case in light of the guidance provided in the
attachment, and take action accordingly. * * *
Attachment
* * * 5. One essential aspect of applying the “practicable alternative” and "water
dependency” provisions of the Guidelines to a particular 404 permit case is to decide what
is the “basic purpose” of the planned activity requiring the proposed discharge of dredged
or fill material. The preamble to the Guidelines provides the following guidance on the
meaning of “basic purpose”:
“Non-water-dependent” discharges are those associated with activities which do not
require access or proximity to or siting within the special aquatic site to fulfill their
basic purpose. An example is a fill to create a restaurant site, since restaurants do
not need be in wetlands to fulfill their basic purpose of feeding people. (45 Fed. Req.
85339, Dec. 24, 1980; emphasis added)
6. The 404(b) (1) analysis for the Plantation Landing Resort, Inc., application, even when
read in conjunction with the Statement of Findings (SOF) and the Environmental
Assessment (EA), does not deal with the issues of practicable alternatives and water
dependency in a satisfactory manner. * * *
7. One significant problem in the [New Orleans District’s] approach to the 404(b)(1) review
is found in the following, which is the only statement in the [New Orleans District’s]
404(b)(1) evaluation document presenting a project-specific reference to the Plantation
Landing case with respect to the practicable alternative requirement of the Guidelines:
Several less environmentally damaging alternatives were identified in the
Environmental Assessment. The applicant stated and supplied information indicating
that these alternatives would not be practicable in light of his overall project
purposes. Recent guidance from [the Lower Mississippi Valley Division] states that
the applicant is the authoritative source of information regarding practicability
determinations, therefore no less environmentally damaging practicable alternatives
are available. ([New Orleans District’s] “Evaluation of Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines”,
***)
This statement appears to allow the applicant to determine whether practicable alternatives
exist to his project. Emphatically, that is not an acceptable approach for conducting the
alternatives review under the 404(b)(1) Guidelines. The Corps is responsible for controlling
every aspect of the 404(b)(1) analysis. While the Corps should consider the views of the
applicant regarding his project’s purpose and the existence (or lack of) practicable
alternatives, the Corps must determine and evaluate these mattes itself, with no control or
direction from the applicant, and without undue deference to the applicant’s wishes. * * *
249

9. A reading of the entire record indicates that [the New Orleans District] accepted the
applicant's assertion that the project as proposed must be accepted by the Corps as the
basis for the 404(b) (1) Guidelines practicability analysis. The applicant proposed a fullyintegrated, waterfront, contiguous water-oriented recreational complex, in the form the
applicant proposed. Consequently, [the New Orleans District] apparently presumed that no
alternative site could be considered if it could not support in one, contiguous waterfront
location the same sort of fully integrated recreational complex that the applicant proposed
to build. * * *
11. The effect of NOD'S deferring to and accepting the applicant's definition of the basic
purpose of his project as a contiguous, fully-integrated, and entirely waterfront resort
complex in the form the applicant had proposed was to ensure that no practicable
alternative could exist. Nevertheless, the , administrative record nowhere provides any
rationale for why the applicant's proposed complex had to be "contiguous" or "fully
integrated" or why all features of it had to be "waterfront." The only reason appearing on the
record to indicate why NOD presumed that the project had to be contiguous, fully
integrated, and entirely waterfront is that the applicant stated that that was his proposal,
thus by definition that was the official project purpose which the Corps must use. That is not
an acceptable approach to interpret and implement the 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Only if the
Corps, independently of the applicant, were to determine that the basic purposes of the
project cannot practicably be accomplished unless the project is built in a “contiguous”,
"fully integrated," and entirely "waterfront" manner would those conditions be relevant to the
404(b) (1) Guidelines' alternative review. The fact that those conditions may be part of the
proposal as presented by the applicant is by no means determinative of that point. Once
again, the Corps, not the applicant, must define the basic purpose underlying the
applicant's proposed activity. * * *
Questions and Comments
1.

Standard of Review of Corps’ alternatives analysis: What standard of review did
the 5th Circuit apply to the Corps’ identification of the purposes of the permit
applicants’ projects and the analysis regarding whether practicable alternatives
existed to achieve those purposes? Does “increas[ing] net return on assets owned
by the company” seem to be an appropriate purpose?
For another case discussing the standard of review that applies to the Corps’
decision-making in many aspects of the 404 permit review, including the alternatives
analysis, see Fund for Animals v. Rice, 85 F.3d 535, 541-542 (11th Cir. 1996). That
court’s discussion of the “arbitrary and capricious” standard is black letter
administrative law and may help explain the 5 th Circuit’s deferential decision in
Louisiana Wildlife Federation v. York.

250

2.

While the 5th Circuit deferred to the Corps’ identification of the project purpose in
Louisiana Wildlife Federation v. York, how much deference does the Court suggest
is due to the applicant’s identification of the purpose? Who makes the final
determination, according to the 5th Circuit?

3.

Plantation Landing Elevation: It is probably not surprising, in light of the language
used by the 5th Circuit in Louisiana Wildlife Federation v. York, that the New Orleans
District of the Corps of Engineers deferred to the applicant’s identification of the
project purpose in carrying out the alternatives analysis for the Plantation Landing
permit application. It should be clear, though, that after that guidance, the Corps
makes an independent determination of the project’s purpose, as well as whether
alternatives are practicable and have less adverse effects on the aquatic
environment. Subsequent to the guidance in the Plantation Landing permit elevation
case, the Corps issued similar guidance in several other permit elevation cases,
including the Hartz Mountain Elevation and the Old Cutler Bay Elevation.
The Corps regulations that implement NEPA review for the Section 404 permit
process explicitly provide “[W]hile generally focusing on the applicant’s statement,
the Corps will, in all cases, exercise independent judgment in defining the purpose
and need for the project from the applicant’s and the public’s perspective.” See 33
C.F.R. Part 325, App. B(9)(c)(4). Although those regulations don’t apply on their
face to the alternatives analysis, the Corps has taken the same approach in
conducting the alternatives analysis since the elevation decisions above.

4.

Flexibility in application: In 1993, recognizing that the impacts from discharges of
dredged or fill material vary greatly, the Corps and EPA jointly issued guidance that
provides that the Guidelines “do not contemplate that the same intensity of analysis
will be required for all types of projects but instead envision a correlation between
the scope of the evaluation and the potential extent of adverse impacts on the
aquatic environment.” See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, RGL 93-02, Guidance on
Flexibility of the 404(b)(1) Guidelines and Mitigation Banking 3 (Aug. 23, 1993).
Accordingly, the guidance suggests that “[t]he amount of information needed to
make such a determination [that there is no practicable alternative to a proposed
discharge] and the level of scrutiny required by the Guidelines is commensurate with
the severity of the environmental impact * * * resource and the nature of the
proposed activity) and the scope/cost of the project.” Id. at 2. How might this
flexibility in application of the guidelines impact the deference accorded to the Corps
when a court reviews the agency’s alternatives analysis? See Greater Yellowstone
Coalition v. Flowers, 359 F.3d 1257 (10th Cir. 2004).

5.

Water-dependent: The characterization of a project's purpose will greatly influence
whether the project is deemed to be "water-dependent" for purposes of the
alternatives analysis. For instance, in Shoreline Associates v. Marsh, when the
251

permit applicant sought permission to discharge fill material to build a boat storage
area and boat launch in conjunction with a townhouse development, the court
upheld the Corps’ determination that the basic purpose of the project was
construction on the townhouse community, which was not water dependent, and
that the construction of the boat launch was only incidental to the basic purpose of
the project. See 555 F. Supp. 169 (D. Md. 1983), aff’d 725 F.2d 677 (4th Cir. 1984).
Several years later, when a permit applicant sought to reopen a river channel to
provide boat access to a residential community, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit upheld the Corps’ determination that the basic purpose of the project
was to provide boat access to the community, which was a water-dependent activity.
See National Wildlife Federation v. Whistler, 27 F.3d 1341 (8th Cir. 1994). The Court
distinguished the Shoreline case and cases like it on the grounds that the residential
community in the case under review was being constructed in uplands and did not
require a permit, so the only activity triggering the permit requirement was the
construction of the boat access. Id. at 1345. Although the Corps rejected the
applicant’s purpose in one case and accepted it in the other, in both cases, the
courts deferred to the agency because they concluded that the agency’s
determination was not arbitrary or capricious.
Alternatives - Availability and Practicability
Since the 404(b)(1) guidelines prohibit the Corps from issuing a permit when practicable
alternatives to the proposed discharge are available that have less adverse impacts on the
aquatic environment, it is important to spend a little time examining how to determine when
an alternative is “available” and when an available alternative is “practicable.” Although
the applicant may suggest that certain alternatives are or are not available or practicable,
the Corps has the ultimate
authority to determine which
alternatives are practicable
alternatives, just as it has the
ultimate
authority
to
determine the basic purpose
of the project. The following
case focuses on determining
when
alternatives
are
“available.”

Unedited opinion (From Justia)

This case arises out of Pyramid's attempt to build a shopping mall on certain wetlands in
Massachusetts known as Sweedens Swamp. Acting under the Clean Water Act, * * * EPA
vetoed the approval by the Corps of a permit to build the mall because EPA found that an
alternative site had been available to Pyramid at the time it entered the market to search for
a site for the mall. The alternative site was purchased later by another developer and
arguably became unavailable by the time Pyramid applied for a permit to build the mall.
On appeal, the thrust of Pyramid's argument is a challenge to what it calls EPA's "market
entry" theory, i.e., the interpretation by EPA of the relevant regulation, which led EPA to
consider the availability of alternative sites at the time Pyramid entered the market for a
site, instead of at the time it applied for a permit. Pyramid argues principally (1) that the
market entry approach is contrary to the regulatory language and past practice; and (2) that
since the Corps, another agency which was jointly responsible with EPA for administering
the program in question, interpreted the pertinent regulation in a different way than EPA
had, and since the market entry issue does not involve environmental expertise, this Court
should not defer to EPA's interpretation of the regulation. * * *
We hold (1) that the market entry theory is consistent with both the regulatory language and
past practice; (2) that EPA's interpretation, while not necessarily entitled to deference, is
reasonable; and (3) that EPA's application of the regulation is supported by the
administrative record. We agree with the district court's conclusion that EPA's findings were
not arbitrary and capricious. We also hold that Pyramid's other arguments * * * lack merit.
We affirm.

***
Statutory and Regulatory Framework
***

The 404(b)(1) guidelines * * * are regulations containing the requirements for issuing a
permit for discharge of dredged or fill materials. 40 C.F.R. Sec. 230.10(a)2 covers "nonwater dependent activities" (i.e., activities that could be performed on non-wetland sites,
such as building a mall) and provides essentially that the Corps must determine whether an
alternative site is available that would cause less harm to the wetlands. Specifically, it
provides that "no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a
practicable alternative" to the proposal that would have a "less adverse impact" on the
"aquatic ecosystem". It also provides that a practicable alternative may include "an area not
presently owned by the applicant which could reasonably be obtained, utilized, expanded
or managed in order to fulfill the basic purpose of the proposed activity." * * * It further
provides that, "unless clearly demonstrated otherwise", practicable alternatives are (1)
"presumed to be available" and (2) "presumed to have less adverse impact on the aquatic
ecosystem". * * * Thus, an applicant such as Pyramid must rebut both of these
presumptions in order to obtain a permit. Sections 230.10(c) and (d) require that the Corps
not permit any discharge that would contribute to significant degradation of the nation's
wetlands and that any adverse impacts must be mitigated through practicable measures.
***
Under Section 404(c) of the Act * * * , EPA has veto power over any decision of the Corps
to issue a permit. It is this provision that is at the heart of the instant case. * * *
Factual Background of the Swedens Swamp Project
Sweedens Swamp is a 49.5 acre wetland which is part of an 80 acre site near Interstate 95
in South Attleboro, Massachusetts. Although some illegal dumping and motorbike
intrusions have occurred, these activities have been found to have had little impact on the
site which remains a "high-quality red maple swamp" providing wildlife habitat and
protecting the area from flooding and pollution.
The effort to build a mall on Sweedens Swamp was initiated by Pyramid's predecessor, the
Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation ("DeBartolo"). DeBartolo purchased the Swamp some
time before April 1982. At the time of this purchase an alternative site was available in
North Attleboro (the "North Attleboro site"). Since Massachusetts requires state approval (in
addition to federal approval) for projects that would fill wetlands, DeBartolo applied to the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering ("DEQE") for permission
to build on Sweedens Swamp. DEQE denied the application in April 1982.
Pyramid took over the project in 1983 while the appeal of the DEQE denial was pending. In
254

April 1983, Massachusetts adopted more rigorous standards for approval of permits. The
new standards added wildlife habitat as a value of wetlands to be protected and required
the absence of a "practicable alternative". In March 1985, DEQE granted approval under
the old, less stringent, regulations. The Massachusetts District Court reversed on the
ground that DEQE should have applied the new regulations, but the Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court ultimately upheld DEQE's approval. * * *
One of the key issues in dispute in the instant case is just when did Pyramid begin
searching for a suitable site for its mall. EPA asserts that Pyramid began to search in the
Spring of 1983. Pyramid asserts that it began to search several months later, in September
1983. The difference is crucial because on July 1, 1983--a date between the starting dates
claimed by EPA and Pyramid--a competitor of Pyramid, the New England Development Co.
("NED"), purchased options to buy the North Attleboro site. This site was located upland
and could have served as a "practicable alternative" to Sweedens Swamp, if it had been
"available" at the relevant time. Thus, if the relevant time to determine whether an
alternative is "available" is the time the applicant is searching for a site (an issue that is
hotly disputed), and if Pyramid began to search at a time before NED acquired options on
the North Attleboro site, there definitely would have been a "practicable alternative" to
Sweedens Swamp, and Pyramid's application should have been denied. On the other
hand, if Pyramid did not begin its search until after NED acquired options on the North
Attleboro site, then the site arguably was not "available" and the permit should have been
granted. Of course it also is possible that the North Attleboro site remained "available" after
NED's acquisition of the options, since Pyramid arguably could have purchased the options
from NED. Moreover, since the North Attleboro site indisputably was "available" when
Pyramid's predecessor, DeBartolo, purchased Sweedens Swamp, one might argue, as
EPA does, that Pyramid should be held to stand in its predecessor's shoes. The district
court apparently agreed with Pyramid on the issue of when Pyramid entered the market,
stating that "Pyramid initially became interested in developing a shopping mall in the
Attleboro area in September 1983." * * *
In December 1983, Pyramid purchased Sweedens Swamp from DeBartolo. In August
1984, Pyramid applied under Sec. 404(a) to the New England regional division of the Corps
(the "NE Corps") for a permit. It sought to fill or alter 32 of the 49.6 acres of the Swamp; to
excavate nine acres of uplands to create artificial wetlands; and to alter 13.3 acres of
existing wetlands to improve its environmental quality. Later Pyramid proposed to mitigate
the adverse impact on the wetlands by creating 36 acres of replacement wetlands in an offsite gravel pit.
During the review of Pyramid's application by EPA, by the Fish and Wildlife Service
("FWS") and by the Corps, Pyramid submitted information on "practicable alternatives",
especially the North Attleboro site. In rejecting that site as an alternative, Pyramid asserted
that building a mall there was not feasible, not that the site was unavailable. In the words of
the district court, Pyramid claimed that
255

"the site lacked sufficient traffic volume and sufficient access from local roads,
potential department store tenants had expressed strong doubts about the feasibility
of the site and previous attempts to develop the site had met with strong resistance
from the surrounding community." * * *
In November 1984, EPA and FWS submitted official comments to the NE Corps
recommending denial of the application because Pyramid's proposal was inconsistent with
the 404(b)(1) guidelines. Pyramid had failed (1) to overcome the presumption of the
availability of alternatives and (2) to mitigate adequately the adverse impact on wildlife.
EPA threatened a Sec. 404(c) review. Pyramid then proposed to create additional artificial
wetlands at a nearby upland site, a proposal it eventually abandoned.
In January 1985, the NE Corps hired a consultant to investigate the feasibility of Sweedens
Swamp and the North Attleboro site. The consultant reported that either site was feasible
but that from a commercial standpoint only one mall could survive in the area. On February
19, 1985, the NE Corps advised Pyramid that denial of its permit was imminent. On May 2,
1985, the NE Corps sent its recommendation to deny the permit to the national
headquarters of the Corps. Although the NE Corps ordinarily makes the final decision on
whether to grant a permit, see 33 C.F.R. Sec. 325.8 (1982), in the instant case, because of
widespread publicity, General John F. Wall, the Director of Civil Works at the national
headquarters of the Corps, decided to review the NE Corps' decision. Wall reached a
different conclusion. He decided to grant the permit after finding that Pyramid's offsite
mitigation proposal would reduce the adverse impacts sufficiently to allow the "practicable
alternative" test to be deemed satisfied. * * *
Although he did not explicitly address the issue, Wall apparently assumed that the relevant
time to determine whether there was a practicable alternative was the time of the
application, not the time the applicant entered the market. In other words, Wall appears to
have assumed that the market entry theory was not the correct approach. ***
[On May 13, 1986, EPA vetoed the permit and found] (2) that the North Attleboro site could
have been available to Pyramid at the time Pyramid investigated the area to search for a
site; * * * [and] (4) that the North Attleboro site was feasible and would have a less adverse
impact on the wetland environment * * * In the second of these findings, EPA used what
Pyramid calls the ‘market entry’ approach.
On July 1, 1986, Pyramid commenced the instant action in the district court to vacate EPA’s
final determination as arbitrary and capricious. * * * On October 6, 1987, the court granted
EPA’s motion for summary judgment. The court stated that, with regard to the market entry
theory, EPA’s interpretation of its regulations was entitled to deference. This appeal
followed.

256

For the reasons which follow, we affirm.
II
One of Pyramid's principal contentions is that the market entry approach is inconsistent
with both the language of the 404(b)(1) guidelines and the past practice of the Corps and
EPA.
A
With regard to the language of the regulations, Pyramid reasons that the 404(b)(1)
guidelines are framed in the present tense, while the market entry approach focuses on the
past by considering whether a practicable alternative was available at the time the applicant
entered the market to search for a site. To support its argument that the 404(b)(1)
guidelines are framed in the present tense, Pyramid quotes the following language:
"An alternative is practicable if it is available.... If it is otherwise a practicable
alternative, an area not presently owned by the applicant which could reasonably be
obtained, utilized, expanded or managed in order to fulfill the basic purpose of the
proposed activity may be considered." * * *
While this argument has a certain surface appeal, we are persuaded that it is contrary to a
common sense reading of the regulations; that it entails an overly literal and narrow
interpretation of the language; and that it creates requirements not intended by Congress.
First, while it is true that the language is in the present tense, it does not follow that the
"most natural" reading of the regulations would create a time-of-application rule. As EPA
points out, "the regulations do not indicate when it is to be determined whether an
alternative 'is' available," (emphasis in original), i.e., the "present" of the regulations might
be the time the application is submitted; the time it is reviewed; or any number of other
times. Based upon a reading of the language in the context of the controlling statute and
the regulations as a whole, moreover, we conclude that when the agencies drafted the
language in question they simply were not thinking of the specific issues raised by the
instant case, in which an applicant had available alternatives at the time it was selecting its
site but these alternatives had evaporated by the time it applied for a permit. We therefore
agree with the district court that the regulations are essentially silent on the issue of timing
and that it would be appropriate to consider the objectives of the Act and the intent
underlying the promulgation of the regulations.
Second, as EPA has pointed out, the preamble to the 404(b)(1) guidelines states that the
purpose of the "practicable alternatives" analysis is "to recognize the special value of
wetlands and to avoid their unnecessary destruction, particularly where practicable
alternatives were available in non-aquatic areas to achieve the basic purpose of the
257

proposal." 45 Fed. Reg. 85,338 (1980) (emphasis added). In other words, the purpose is to
create an incentive for developers to avoid choosing wetlands when they could choose an
alternative upland site. Pyramid's reading of the regulations would thwart this purpose
because it would remove the incentive for a developer to search for an alternative site at
the time such an incentive is needed, i.e., at the time it is making the decision to select a
particular site. If the practicable alternatives analysis were applied to the time of the
application for a permit, the developer would have little incentive to search for alternatives,
especially if it were confident that alternatives soon would disappear. Conversely, in a case
in which alternatives were not available at the time the developer made its selection, but
became available by the time of application, the developer's application would be denied
even though it could not have explored the alternative site at the time of its decision.
Pyramid attacks this reasoning by arguing that few developers would take the risk that an
available alternative site would become unavailable and that EPA's reading improperly
considers the motives and subjective state of mind of the applicant. These arguments are
wide of the mark. Whether most real-life developers would take such a risk is irrelevant.
The point is that Pyramid's time-of-application theory is completely at odds with the
expressed intent of the regulations to provide an incentive to avoid choosing wetlands.
Similarly, EPA's interpretation does not require courts to investigate the subjective state of
mind of a developer. EPA discusses state-of-mind issues only because it is discussing the
purpose behind the regulations, which is concerned with incentives, and thus in fact is
indirectly concerned with the developer's state of mind.
In short, we conclude that a common sense reading of the statute can lead only to the use
of the market entry approach used by EPA.
B
With regard to the past practice of the Corps and EPA, Pyramid asserts that neither has
ever applied a market entry approach. It first cites two previous final determinations of EPA
* * * On the basis of these determinations, Pyramid argues that, had EPA been using a
market entry approach in these cases, it would have examined whether alternatives were
available at earlier times and that EPA had failed to make such an examination. * * *
Our examination of these prior decisions has satisfied us, however, that the issue raised in
the instant case simply has not been addressed before. [The court then discussed why the
issue was not relevant in the prior decisions cited by Pyramid.] * * *
We believe that the issue essentially is one of first impression. We view EPA’s action in the
instant case as an application of the regulatory language to the specific needs of the case
which arose here for the first time. We therefore hold that EPA has not acted contrary to
prior practice under the regulations.

258

III
[In Part III of the opinion, the court addressed Pyramid’s claim that EPA’s interpretation of
the Guidelines was not entitled to deference because the Corps was charged with issuing
Section 404 permits and the Corps had adopted a different interpretation of the Guidelines.
The Court did not ultimately determine whether EPA’s interpretation, as opposed to the
Corps’, was entitled to a greater level of deference because (1) the court felt that it was
unclear whether the Corps was evaluating alternatives based on a “time of application”
theory or a “market entry” theory; and (2) regardless of whether EPA was entitled to a
greater level of deference than the Corps, EPA’s decision was valid under the normal
standard of review that would apply in the case - the arbitrary and capricious standard.]
Questions and Comments
1.

EPA’s veto: As mentioned above and as will be discussed in detail in Chapter 8,
infra, EPA can veto permits issued by the Corps if EPA determines that the
permitted discharge will have unacceptable adverse effects. Since EPA vetoed the
permit, the court is reviewing EPA’s decision, rather than the Corps. In light of EPA’s
veto authority, it is probably more accurate to say that the government, rather than
the Corps, has the ultimate authority to determine whether alternatives are available
and practicable.

2.

Timing of availability: In determining whether an alternative is “available” to a
permit applicant, what is the appropriate time period to examine, according to the
court? Should the Corps examine the alternatives that are available at the time of
the permit application? What are the disadvantages of that approach, according to
the court? Does the market entry approach achieve the goal of the statute and
regulations if there are alternatives available at the time of application that were not
available when the applicant entered the market? As an alternative, should the
Corps examine the alternatives that are available at the time the agency is deciding
whether to issue or deny the permit, regardless of what alternatives were available
earlier? The dissent, in a portion of the opinion not reproduced above, suggests that
a “time of decision” rule would be most consistent with the goals of the statute and
regulations. Do you understand why? If you read the dissent’s opinion, you’ll notice
that the dissent has an “interesting” view regarding the goals of the Clean Water Act
and the 404(b)(1) Guidelines.

3.

Applying the market entry test: If the government will examine the alternatives
that are available to a permit applicant at the time the applicant enters the market for
the project in the permit application, when does the applicant “enter” the market?
When the first internal memo is circulated? When they hire a consultant? Did the
court articulate a precise test to determine when an applicant “enters” the market?
259

Did it have to do so in this case?
4.

Property not owned by the applicant: As was evident in this case, the 404(b)(1)
Guidelines provide that “available” alternatives include areas “not presently owned
by the applicant which could reasonably be obtained, utilized, expanded or
managed in order to fulfill the basic purpose of the proposed activity.” See 40 C.F.R.
§ 230.10(a)(2).

5.

Fairness: What role do considerations of fairness play in this case? On the one
hand, the majority suggested that it might be appropriate to examine alternatives
that existed at the time that the permit applicant’s predecessor entered the market,
because the applicant received a permit from the State of Massachusetts for the
project under state standards that had been replaced because the applicant took
over its predecessor’s permit application, which was proceeding under the old
standards and was grand-fathered.
On the other hand, the permit applicant argued that the government’s decision to
apply a “market entry” test to determine whether alternatives were “available” was a
retroactive application of a new standard. Was it? Can agencies make decisions in
adjudication that apply retroactively? What are the limits on the agency?

6.

Changing positions: The permit applicant argued that EPA’s decision to apply a
“market entry” approach should be invalidated because the “market entry” test
represented a change in the agency’s interpretation of the Guidelines and was
inconsistent with the prior interpretation of the Guidelines. The court did not believe
that the agency was changing its past interpretation or practice. How would the
court’s analysis have differed if EPA’s interpretation represented a change in its
prior interpretation of the Guidelines? Can agencies change their interpretations of
regulations over time? If so, are there any limits on those changes? Could EPA have
adopted a “market entry” approach if it had previously adopted a regulation that
indicated that alternatives would be evaluated based on alternatives that are
available at the time of the permit application?

7.

Dueling agencies: The permit applicant argued that EPA’s interpretation of the
404(b)(1) Guidelines is not entitled to deference in this case because the Corps,
rather than EPA, administers the Section 404 permit program on a daily basis. The
court did not ultimately determine whether EPA’s interpretation was entitled to
greater deference than the Corps’ interpretation because the court concluded that
EPA’s interpretation was not arbitrary or capricious and was valid even without any
additional deference. However, if the court had to decide the question, would EPA’s
interpretation be entitled to greater deference than the Corps if they interpreted the
Guidelines differently? What is the analysis that should be used to resolve that
issue?
260

8.

Less adverse impact - Buy down: The Corps granted the permit in this case
because the decisionmaker concluded that the practicable alternatives to the
proposed discharge would not have less adverse impact on the aquatic environment
when compared to the impacts of the proposed discharge, taking into consideration
the off-site mitigation for the proposed discharge. At the time, it was not unusual for
the Corps to allow permit applicants to satisfy the alternatives analysis by “buying
down” (reducing) the effects of a proposed discharge to a level where they would be
equal to or less than the effects of practicable alternatives. However, in 1990, EPA
and the Corps entered into a Memorandum of Agreement that clarified that
compensatory mitigation should not be considered in determining the effects of a
proposed discharge for purposes of the alternatives analysis required by the Section
404(b)(1) Guidelines. See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers & U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Memorandum of Agreement: The Determination of Mitigation
Under the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Feb. 6, 1990). The Corps
and EPA still follow that approach today. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.1(f)(2).

9.

Considering cost in determining practicability: The preamble to the 404(b)(1)
Guidelines provides that “[t]he mere fact that an alternative may cost somewhat
more does not mean it is not practicable.” See 45 Fed. Reg. 85336, 85339 (Dec. 24,
1980). However, if the alternative is “unreasonably expensive”, it will not be
considered to be “practicable.” Id. at 85343. Although the analysis is very factsensitive, cases where courts have found that alternatives are not “practicable” due
to the cost include James City County v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 955
F.2d 254 (4th Cir. 1992) (cost of alternative would be 50% higher than cost of
proposed activity); Friends of the Earth v. Hintz, 800 F.2d 822 (9th Cir. 1986)
(alternative would have increased costs by $1 million per year).

Hypothetical
Several years ago, Springfield FC, a minor league professional soccer team, moved out of
the city of Springfield because the club felt that the city did not adequately maintain the
stadium in which they played. The owners of the club, who leased the stadium from the city,
complained that the city did not adequately maintain the turf, the locker rooms, or the training
fields. In addition, the owners of the club complained that there was not adequate parking at
the stadium and that the two lane access roads to the stadium were too small. It was
surprising that so many fans attended the games because the stadium was located within a
mile of the city's retired solid waste landfill, and the smell that emanated from the landfill was
rather unpleasant.
In order to attract another professional soccer team to Springfield, city officials formed the
Springfield Stadium Development Authority (SSDA) on October 31, 2011 to spearhead the
construction of a new stadium in Springfield. The SSDA decided that the stadium should be
located downtown, so that it could spur redevelopment of the city's central business district.
In January, 2012, the SSDA began to explore potential locations for the stadium. The first
property that they considered was a 40 acre parcel of land in the central business district that
was an abandoned zipper factory. Construction on that site would not have impacted any
wetlands, but the SSDA was concerned that the costs of demolishing the factory and
cleaning up any pollution from the site would be exorbitant. An environmental consultant
estimated that clean-up costs could exceed $30 million.
A few weeks later, the SSDA visited a 30 acre plot of undeveloped land that was located a
mile away from the zipper factory, but still in the central business district. At the time, Ned
Rooney, the owner of the site, was listing the property at $7 million. Construction on the site
would not have impacted any wetlands, and the SSDA strongly considered purchasing that
property until they found the Sturridge Family Trust Property.
The Sturridge property is a 40 acre plot of land that is located just outside of the central
business district, near the Springfield River, and was advertised for sale at $6 million.
Although it is located outside of the central business district, SSDA believed that
development of the stadium on that site will still spur redevelopment in the central business
district. Unfortunately, the property contained 20 acres of wetlands, and it would be very
difficult to build the stadium on the property without impacting the wetlands.
In addition to those sites, the SSDA looked at a 50 acre parcel of undeveloped land that was
located in the northern suburbs of Springfield. Construction of the stadium on that site would
not have impacted any wetlands, but the SSDA rejected the site because it was not located
near the central business district. Further, the Springfield city manager identified a 30 acre
parcel of vacant land that was located near the central business district (the Portsmouth site),
but the SSDA rejected that site because it was not for sale at the time. Construction on that
site would have impacted 2 acres of isolated wetlands.

262

The SSDA also considered upgrading the existing soccer stadium and expanding the parking
and access roads to the stadium, which was located just outside the central business district.
Those improvements would not have impacted any wetlands. Although the improvements
would have cost about $15 million, an economist for the SSDA forecast that the
improvements would increase the value of the stadium by $30 million and could attract a
professional soccer team that would lease the stadium and pay the city enough money to
cover the redevelopment costs within 15 years.
However, the economist also advised the SSDA that construction of a new stadium on the
Sturridge property would likely provide income that was twice as much as the city could
receive if it upgraded the existing stadium.
After exploring all of those sites, the SSDA decided to purchase the Sturridge property. At the
time that they bought the property, the Rooney property had already been sold to another
developer, who had begun construction of a mall on the property.
Since construction of the stadium on the Sturridge property involved a discharge of dredged
or fill material into wetlands that are adjacent to the Springfield River, the SSDA applied to
the Corps of Engineers for a Section 404 permit. The proposed development would destroy
15 acres of wetlands that provide flood control for the downtown area of the city and
important wildlife habitat. The SSDA identified the purpose of the project, in its permit
application as "to construct a soccer stadium for a professional soccer team in an area of
Springfield that will spur redevelopment of the city's central business district."
Which of the properties identified above are likely to be considered "available" alternatives in
the Corps' review of the permit application? Are there any practicable alternatives to the
SSDA's development proposal that would have less adverse impact on the aquatic
ecosystem? Do any presumptions apply to the Corps' review of the permit application? Is it
likely that the Corps will issue the permit to SSDA for the project as proposed by SSDA?

Chapter 7
Mitigation
When the Corps issues a Section 404 permit that authorizes the discharge of dredged or fill
material into wetlands, at least some wetlands are likely to be destroyed or degraded, even
though the permit applicant has taken measures to avoid and minimize the impacts. For
that reason, the Corps has, from the early days of the Section 404 permit program,
included conditions in permits that require the permittee to offset those environmental
harms by providing compensatory mitigation.
I.

Types of Mitigation

There are basically four types of compensatory mitigation:





Restoration
Enhancement
Creation
Preservation

Restoration of wetlands involves re-establishing or
rehabilitating wetlands with the goal of returning
natural or historic functions to a former wetland or a
degraded wetland. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.2. Wetlands
are re-established or rehabilitated by manipulating the
physical, chemical or biological characteristics of a
site. Id. For instance, a wetland that has been drained
may be restored by removing underground drain tiles,
plugging open ditches, or building small dikes. See
Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Wetland
Restoration Techniques. Restoration often provides
the most cost-effective improvement in wetland
function. See U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Engineering Field Handbook, Part 650, Chapter 13,
Wetland Restoration, Enhancement or Creation 13-2
(Apr. 2008) [hereinafter “USDA Engineering Field
264

Photo 34 Wetlands Restoration - USDA
Photo on

Wetlands_restoration_hughes_co_south_
dakota.jpg

Handbook”]. Sites that will be restored often have wetlands soils and some wetland plants
and mainly require re-establishment of the former hydrology and topography.
Enhancement of wetlands involves manipulating the physical, chemical or biological
characteristics of an existing wetland to improve a particular function or functions. See 33
C.F.R. § 332.2. For instance, enhancement projects might involve diverting a small stream
into a wetland to change the water depth or planting different vegetation in the wetland in
order to provide habitat for different varieties of fish, birds, or other wildlife. See USDA
Engineering Field Handbook 13-2. By improving some functions of wetlands, though,
enhancement projects might impair other functions. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.2. For example,
by improving the habitat for some varieties of fish and wildlife, a project may degrade the
habitat for others. Enhancement projects do not generally increase the acreage of existing
wetlands. Id. While restoration and enhancement projects can both take place in degraded
wetlands, restoration projects focus on returning the site to a prior condition, while
enhancement focuses on changing the functions of the site, without regard to the prior
condition of the site. Wetlands enhancement projects generally require more management
and are more expensive than wetlands restoration projects. See USDA Engineering Field
Handbook 13-2.
Creation (or establishment) of wetlands involves manipulating the physical, chemical or
biological characteristics of land to establish wetlands in uplands or on lands where
wetlands did not previously exist. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.2. Wetland creation is the most
difficult type of compensatory mitigation because it requires bringing water to a site where it
does not naturally occur and establishing vegetation on soils that are not hydric soils. See
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, An Introduction and User’s Guide
to Wetland Restoration, Creation and Enhancement 11. Consequently, wetland creation is
more expensive and requires more management than other mitigation options. See USDA
Engineering Field Handbook 13-2. Wetlands are often created for only one function, such
as providing wildlife habitat, educational opportunities, or improving water quality of nonpoint source runoff. Id. If successful, though, wetland creation provides an increase in the
functions and acreage of wetlands. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.2
Preservation of wetlands involves the permanent protection of ecologically important
wetlands through the implementation of appropriate legal and physical mechanisms, such
as conservation easements or transfer of title. See 40 C.F.R. §230.93(h). It does not
provide an increase in wetland functions or acreage. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.2
The purpose of compensatory mitigation is to develop long term self-sustaining aquatic
resources that offset adverse effects and are not dependent on human intervention after
the mitigation has been established. See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento
District, Mitigation.
Of the four types of compensatory mitigation, restoration is generally the preferred option
265

because it has a greater likelihood of success and impacts potentially ecologically
important uplands less than wetlands creation, and because it provides greater gains in
wetlands functions than wetlands enhancement or preservation. See 33 C.F.R. §
332.3(a)(2). Preservation is limited to preserving ecologically important wetlands and
resources and normally is only accepted as part of a package of mitigation that also
includes restoration, enhancement or creation of wetlands resources. See 40 C.F.R. §
230.93(h).
Thus, when the Corps issues a Section 404 permit that authorizes the destruction or
degradation of wetlands, the Corps will generally include conditions in the permit that
require the permittee to offset those environmental harms by restoring, enhancing, creating
and/or preserving wetlands.
As will be explained further below, the Corps may require the permittee to carry out and
manage the mitigation project itself, or it may allow the permittee to provide the required
mitigation by purchasing mitigation credits from a mitigation bank that restores, enhances,
creates or preserves wetlands or by paying a fee, “in lieu” of doing the mitigation itself, to
an organization that been approved by the Corps to restore, enhance, create or preserve
wetlands. “Permitee-responsible mitigation”, “mitigation banking” and the “in lieu fee
programs” will be discussed in detail below.
II.

Legal Authority for Mitigation

The Clean Water Act does not explicitly state that Section 404 permits must include
compensatory mitigation requirements, but the statute provides that the 404(b)(1)
Guidelines, which establish the criteria for permit evaluation, should be based on criteria
comparable to the ocean dumping criteria in Section 403(c) of the Clean Water Act, and
those criteria require avoidance and minimization of impacts. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(b)(1).
Until 2008, the 404(b)(1) Guidelines also did not explicitly require compensatory mitigation,
although they required permittees to take “appropriate and practicable steps ... [to]
minimize potential adverse impacts ... on the aquatic ecosystem.” See 40 C.F.R. §
230.10(d). For several decades, therefore, the Corps and EPA used guidance documents,
such as memoranda of agreement, action plans, and Regulatory Guidance Letters, to
explain and administer the compensatory mitigation requirements in Section 404 permits.
In 2003, however, Congress included a provision in Section 314 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, P.L. 108-136, 117 Stat. 1392, that required the
Corps, within two years, to promulgate regulations governing mitigation and mitigation
banking for the Section 404 permitting program. In response, in 2008, a few years late, the
Corps and EPA published compensatory mitigation rules. See 73 Fed. Reg. 19594 (Apr.
10, 2008). The new rules superseded most of the guidance documents that the agencies
266

previously used to administer the compensatory mitigation requirements. See 33 C.F.R. §
332.1(f).
Incidentally, those regulations also suggest that compensatory mitigation can be required in
order to ensure that an activity authorized by a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit or a
Rivers and Harbors Act Section 10 permit is “not contrary to the public interest.” Id. §
332.1(d). However, as noted earlier, the Corps rarely relies solely on its “public interest”
authority to support decisions involving Section 404 permits.
The Corps has also cited the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as a basis for the
mitigation requirements that are included in Section 404 permits. See Memorandum of
Agreement Between the Department of the Army and the Environmental Protection
Agency: The Determination of Mitigation Under the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1)
Guidelines § II.A. (Feb. 1990) [hereinafter “1990 MOA”].

Mitigation Sequencing and Permit Conditions

Mitigation requirements are formulated by the Corps, with input from EPA, the Fish and
Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service, and are included as conditions in
Section 404 permits. If EPA, the Fish and Wildlife Service, or the National Marine Fisheries
Service disagree with the mitigation requirements that the Corps plans to include in a
permit, they can elevate their dispute to higher levels within the agencies pursuant to the
404(q) dispute resolution process described in the last chapter. While the Corps makes the
final determination regarding the mitigation conditions included in the permit, EPA retains
the authority to veto the permit if it concludes that the mitigation is not adequate. See
Chapter 8, infra.
Since mitigation requirements are included as conditions in the permit, the Corps can bring
enforcement actions against the permittee if the permittee does not comply with the
mitigation requirements. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(s).
267

As noted in the last chapter, when the Corps evaluates alternatives to a permit applicant’s
proposed project under the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines to determine whether there are
practicable alternatives that have less adverse impacts on the aquatic environment, the
Corps compares the effects of the alternatives to the effects of the proposed project,
without regard to any mitigation. It does not compare the effects of alternatives to the
effects of the proposed project, as reduced by mitigation measures. It is only after the
Corps determines that there are no practicable alternatives to the proposed discharge that
the Corps addresses mitigation. This approach was first announced in a 1990
Memorandum of Agreement between the Corps and EPA. See 1990 MOA, supra.
The 1990 MOA creates a mitigation sequencing process to implement the requirement in
the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines that the Corps must require permittees to take
“appropriate and practicable steps ... [to] minimize potential adverse impacts ... on the
aquatic ecosystem.” See 40 C.F.R. § 230.10(d). The three step sequence consists of (1)
avoidance;
(2)
minimizati
Mitigation Sequence
on; and (3)
 Avoid
compensat
 Minimize
ory
 Mitigate
mitigation;
in
that
order.

Avoid: As the first step in the process, the Corps must ensure that the proposed discharge
avoids impacts to wetlands and the aquatic ecosystem. It does this through the alternatives
analysis described above. If there is a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge
that would have less adverse impacts on the aquatic environment, the Corps may not issue
a permit authorizing the proposed discharge. The 1990 MOA explicitly provided that
“Compensatory mitigation may not be used as a method to reduce environmental impacts
in the evaluation of the least environmentally damaging practicable alternatives for the
purposes of requirements under Section 230.10(a).” See 1990 MOA, § II.C.1. The
alternatives analysis, therefore, helps ensure that the permittee avoids impacts to wetlands
and aquatic resources if practicable.
268

Minimize: The second step in the mitigation sequence is minimization. Impacts to wetlands
and the aquatic environment that cannot be avoided must be minimized. As the 1990 MOA
notes, the 404(b)(1) Guidelines provide that appropriate and practicable steps to minimize
adverse impacts will be required through project modifications and permit conditions. See
40 C.F.R. § 230.10(d) Subpart H of the Guidelines outlines several actions to minimize
impacts, including actions concerning the location of the discharge (i.e., confining it to
minimize smothering organisms); actions concerning the material to be discharged (i.e., to
reduce the potency and availability of pollutants); actions controlling the material after
discharge (i.e., capping contaminated material with clean material); actions affecting the
method of dispersion (setting limits on the amount of material discharged per unit of time or
volume of receiving water); actions affecting plant and animal populations (i.e., avoiding
sites having unique habitat value) and others. See 40 C.F.R. Part 230, Subpart H. The
Corps includes such requirements as conditions of Section 404 permits.
Mitigate: The final step in the mitigation sequence is compensatory mitigation. Since a
proposed discharge may still cause adverse impacts to the aquatic environment after the
Corps has required the permittee to avoid and minimize the impacts, the Corps includes
conditions in Section 404 permits to require compensatory mitigation for those remaining
adverse effects. The MOA provides “Appropriate and practicable compensatory mitigation
is required for unavoidable adverse impacts which remain after all appropriate and
practicable minimization has been required.” See 1990 MOA § II.C.3.
In addition to creating the mitigation sequence to be used when evaluating Section 404
permit applications, the 1990 MOA clearly provided that mitigation requirements “shall be
conditions” of Section 404 permits and that the Corps should deny Section 404 permits “[i]f
the mitigation plan necessary to ensure compliance with the Guidelines is not reasonably
implementable or enforceable.” Id. § III.E.
The 1990 MOA was challenged shortly after the agencies entered into the agreement, but
the federal district court hearing the challenge held that the MOA was an interpretive rule,
rather than a substantive or legislative rule, and that the challenge to the MOA was not ripe.
See Municipality of Anchorage v. United States, 21 ELR 20119 (D. Alaska 1990), aff’d 980
F.2d 1320 (9th Cir. 1992).
The legality of mitigation sequencing no longer depends on the legality or enforceability of
the 1990 MOA, however, as the Corps and EPA incorporated the sequencing requirement
into the 2008 mitigation regulations. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.1(c). While those regulations
superseded most of the other mitigation guidance documents issued by the Corps prior to
the regulations, the regulations provided that the 1990 MOA remained in effect, except for
portions of the MOA that addressed the amount, type and location of compensatory
mitigation projects. Id. § 332.1(f)(2).

269

IV.

Amount and Type of Mitigation Required

A.

No Net Loss

The presumptions and policies that the Corps uses to determine how much compensatory
mitigation and what type of compensatory mitigation are required have evolved over time,
but have always left considerable discretion in the hands of the individuals that are
reviewing the permit applications. However, the overarching goal to be used in calculating
the amount and type of mitigation has remained fairly constant. Beginning with the 1990
MOA, the Corps and EPA indicated that they would “strive”, in making decisions regarding
compensatory mitigation, “to achieve a goal of no overall net loss of values and
functions.” See 1990 MOA § II.B. However, they stressed that the goal “may not be
achieved in each and every permit action.” Id. In theory, therefore, in most cases, the
compensatory mitigation that will be required for each permit should replace the values
and functions (and not simply acreage) of the wetlands that will be destroyed or degraded
by the project authorized by the permit. The “no net loss” policy was re-affirmed in
Regulatory Guidance Letters in 2001, see U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , RGL 01-01,
Guidance for the Establishment and Maintenance of Compensatory Mitigation Projects
Under the Corps Regulatory Program Pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Clean Water Act
and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (Oct. 31, 2001), and 2002, see U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, RGL 02-02, Guidance on Compensatory Mitigation Projects for
Aquatic Resource Impacts Under the Corps Regulatory Program Pursuant to Section 404
of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 § 2.c. (Dec.
24, 2002) (clarifying that Districts will strive to achieve the goal on a cumulative basis, even
though it may not be achieved for every permit action, and that the Corps will achieve the
goal programmatically). While the Corps’ 2008 permit regulations did not explicitly codify
the “no net loss” policy, the preamble to the regulations indicated that the portions of the
1990 MOA that created the policy were not superseded by the regulations. See 70 Fed.
Reg. at 19603.
B.

On-site and in-kind

While the “no overall net loss of values and functions” goal has not changed, the manner in
which it has been implemented in permit decisions has changed over time. The 1990
MOA established preferences for “on-site” compensatory mitigation and “in-kind”
compensatory mitigation. The MOA indicated that compensatory actions “should be
undertaken, when practicable, in areas adjacent or continuous to the discharge site.” See
1990 MOA § II.C.3. In addition, it provided that “[i]f on-site compensatory mitigation is not
practicable, off-site compensatory mitigation should be undertaken in the same geographic
area if practicable.” Id. Since the goal of the mitigation was to replace the values and
functions of the wetlands destroyed or degraded by the permitted discharge, mitigation
measures at or near the site of those wetlands were deemed to be more likely to replace
those values and functions. If a wetland is providing flood control for a particular area, for
270

instance, creation of another wetland at a different location is unlikely to serve that same
function. The preference for “in-kind” compensation (replacement of a particular type of
wetland lost with a similar type of wetland) was based on similar considerations. As noted
in Chapter 1, infra, a freshwater marsh will likely provide values and functions that may not
be replaced by a forested swamp. The policy presumed that wetlands were more likely to
replace the values and functions of wetlands destroyed or degraded if the mitigation
wetlands were the same type of wetlands as those destroyed or degraded.
On-site and in-kind mitigation may be more likely to replace the values and functions of the
wetlands being destroyed or degraded by a section 404 permitted discharge than off-site or
out-of-kind mitigation if the mitigation measures are actually being implemented
successfully. However, in 2001, the National Research Council of the National
Academy of Sciences issued a report that suggested that the Corps was not adequately
monitoring mitigation projects and that the literature on mitigation at the time suggested that
“required mitigation projects often are not undertaken or fail to meet permit conditions.” See
National Research Council. Compensating for Wetland Losses Under the Clean Water Act
3 (The National Academies Press, 2001) [hereinafter “NRC Mitigation Report”]. The Council
suggested that the Corps should consider the values and functions that wetlands serve
within a watershed when making mitigation decisions, rather than simply focusing on the
impacts at or near the site. Id. at 3-4. The Council suggested that “a preference for on-site
and in-kind mitigation should not be automatic, but should follow from an analytically based
assessment of the wetland needs in the watershed and the potential for the compensatory
wetland to persist over time.” Id. The Council’s report explained that on-site mitigation
measures may frequently be unsuccessful because the hydrology, soils and vegetation at
the site may not support the mitigation project, and recommended selection of sites to
promote development of self-sustaining mitigation. Id. at 4-5. Regarding the preference for
“in-kind” mitigation, the report also noted that some types of wetlands, such as fens and
bogs, could not be restored based on the knowledge at the time of the report. Id. at 4.
The Corps responded to the National Research Council Report by issuing a 2001
Regulatory Guidance Letter that softened the preferences. See RGL 01-01, supra. The
agency was heavily criticized because it made major changes to the 1990 MOA in the RGL
without involving EPA or other agencies in the development of the policy, so the agency
replaced that Guidance Letter a year later with a new Regulatory Guidance Letter that it
developed with input from the other agencies. See RGL 02-02, supra. The new guidance
indicated that mitigation should be used to “maintain wetland functional levels within a
watershed” and that off-site mitigation could be used “when it provides more watershed
benefit than on-site mitigation.” Id. § 2.g. Similarly, the guidance indicated that out-of-kind
mitigation was appropriate when it was “practicable and provides more environmental or
watershed benefit than in-kind compensation.” Id. § 2.h.
That Guidance was superseded by the 2008 regulations, though, which now establish a
hierarchy for selecting compensatory mitigation and which establish a preference for
271

selecting mitigation based on a watershed approach. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.3(b)(4). Thus,
the 1990 MOA preference for on-site, in-kind mitigation has been replaced by a preference
for selecting mitigation on a watershed basis. In situations where a watershed approach is
not practicable, though, the regulations maintain a preference for on-site and in-kind
mitigation over off-site and out-of-kind mitigation. Id. § 332.3(b)(5).
C.

Ratios and Timing

Two other important issues that arise concerning compensatory mitigation involve the
amount of mitigation that will be required and the timing of the mitigation project. Regarding
the amount of mitigation, the 1990 MOA recognized that implementation of the “no net
loss” goal meant that mitigation should provide at least a one to one replacement of the
values and functions of wetlands, and not simply a one to one replacement of acreage.
See 1990 MOA § II.B. However, the MOA also provided that in the absence of more
definitive information on the functions and values of specific wetlands, a minimum 1 to 1
acreage replacement ratio may be used as a reasonable surrogate for no net loss of
values and functions. Id. Thus, if 10 acres of wetlands were being destroyed or degraded,
the Corps could require the permittee to provide 10 acres of wetlands mitigation in the
absence of more definitive information on the values and functions of those wetlands.
Even if it is possible to precisely identify the values and functions that are being lost when a
wetland is destroyed or degraded and to precisely identify the values and functions that
could be provided by wetlands that may be restored, enhanced, created, or preserved, the
ratio adopted by the Corps for mitigation projects will vary depending on the type of project
(restoration, enhancement, creation, or preservation) because some types of mitigation
projects, like preservation, do not provide any increase in values or functions to offset the
values and functions lost, and because some mitigation projects, like restoration, may have
greater chances to succeed than others, like wetlands creation.
The 1990 MOA recognized this dynamic, providing that the 1 to 1 ratio “may be greater
where the functional values of the area being impacted are demonstrably high and the
replacement wetlands are of lower functional value or the likelihood of success of the
mitigation project is low [and that ] ... the ratio may be less than 1 to 1 for areas where the
functional values associated with the area being impacted are demonstrably low and the
likelihood of success associated with the mitigation proposal is high.” Id. Accordingly, while
the Corps might require a permittee to restore 10 acres of wetlands to replace 10 acres of
wetlands (1:1 ratio), they may require the permittee to create 30 acres (3:1 ratio), instead of
restoring 10, to replace those wetlands, since the likelihood of successful wetland creation
may be lower than the likelihood of successful restoration.
The Corps re-affirmed the 1990 MOA approach in the 2002 Regulatory Guidance Letter,
see RGL 02-02, supra, but the 2008 regulations superseded both that RGL and the portion
of the 1990 MOA that created that approach. The regulations adopt a similar approach,
272

though, and provide little more certainty regarding specific ratios than the prior guidance
provided. Specifically, the regulations indicate that the amount of compensatory mitigation
must be sufficient to replace “lost aquatic functions”, based on “appropriate functional or
conditional assessment methods or other suitable metrics.” See 33 C.F.R. § 332.3(f)(1).
Where those methods or metrics aren’t available, the regulations provide that “a minimum
one to one acreage or linear foot compensation ratio must be used.” Id. They also require
the permit issuer (district engineer) to require a ratio greater than one to one “to account for
the method of compensatory mitigation (e.g., preservation), the likelihood of success,
differences between the functions lost at the impact site and the functions expected to be
produced by the compensatory mitigation project, temporal losses of aquatic resource
functions, the difficulty of restoring or establishing the desired aquatic resource type and
functions, and/or the distance between the affected aquatic resource and the compensation
site.” Id. § 332.3(f)(2).
While the guidance and regulations leave considerable discretion to the permit issuer to
identify specific ratios for compensatory mitigation, in practice, most Districts have adopted
guidance that identify ratios for specific types of mitigation projects. See Margaret Strand,
Wetlands Deskbook 93 (Environmental Law institute, 3d ed., 2009).
Regarding the timing of compensatory mitigation, in light of concerns that many mitigation
projects were not being implemented or were not succeeding, the 2001 National Research
Council report recommended that “compensatory mitigation should be in place concurrent
with, and preferably before, permitted activity” and that “there should be effective legal and
financial assurances for long-term site sustainability and monitoring of all compensatory
wetland projects”. See NRC Mitigation Report, supra, at 7. The 2008 regulations codified
those requirements, (1) providing that “[i]mplementation of the compensatory mitigation
project shall be, to the maximum extent practicable, in advance of or concurrent with the
activity causing the authorized impacts”; (2) requiring additional compensatory mitigation to
offset any losses of wetland functions that occur between the time of the discharge and the
implementation of the mitigation, see 33 C.F.R. § 332.3(m); and (3) requiring “sufficient
financial assurances to ensure a high level of confidence that the compensatory mitigation
project will be successfully completed.” Id. § 332.3(n).

273

Questions and Comments
1.

Monitoring: Although the 1990 MOA indicated that monitoring was an important
aspect of mitigation, see 1990 MOA § III.D, the 2001 National Academy of Sciences
National Research Council Report suggested that the Corps was not adequately
monitoring and tracking the success of mitigation projects associated with Section
404 permits. See NRC Mitigation Report, supra, at 3. A 2005 Government
Accountability Office (GAO) report also concluded that the Corps was infrequently
monitoring and rarely inspecting compensatory mitigation projects. See U.S.
Government Accountability Office, GAO-05-898, Corps of Engineers Does Not Have
an Effective Oversight Approach to Ensure That Compensatory Mitigation is
Occurring (Sept. 8, 2005). In light of those reports, the Corps’ 2008 mitigation
regulations require permittees to monitor the mitigation and submit reports pursuant
to a monitoring plan approved by the Corps, but the regulations provide flexibility to
the Corps to tailor the monitoring requirements and reporting frequency to the
specific mitigation project. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.6. For a detailed examination of the
role that outside organizations have played, or should play, in monitoring and
enforcing mitigation requirements, see Jessica Owley, The Increasing Privatization
of Environmental Permitting, 46 Akron L. Rev. 1091 (2013).

2.

Success of mitigation: Various studies have found that (1) fewer than 30% of the
mitigation sites reviewed were successful in replacing the functions of the wetlands
sites that they replaced; (2) fewer than 50% of mitigation sites reviewed were
ecologically successful; and (3) failure rates for some types of wetlands are
significantly higher than the failure rate for other types of wetlands, resulting in a
shift in the predominance of various types of wetlands. See Rebecca L. Kihslinger,
Success of Wetland Mitigation Projects, 30:2 National Wetlands Newsletter 14, 15
(2008). In addition, a recent EPA Office of the Inspector General report criticized
EPA for claiming that the agency reported “no net loss” of wetlands in the Section
404 regulatory program for fiscal years 2009-2011 because the agency presumed
that mitigation projects for permitted activities will meet performance standards,
when many of the projects failed to meet those standards. See U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Office of the Inspector General, Report No. 14-P-0191, EPA
Needs to Clarify its Claim of “No Net Loss” of Wetlands 1-3 (April 16, 2014). How
should the information reported by Rebecca Kihslinger and the information in the
Inspector General report affect permitting and mitigation decisions?

3.

Mitigation Planning: The 2008 mitigation regulations also established planning
requirements for mitigation, so that each mitigation project must have a mitigation
plan approved by the Corps including the following elements:

274

4.

Shortly after the agencies adopted the 2008 mitigation rule, several members of the
National Research Council’s Committee on Mitigating Wetland Losses critiqued the
rule, discussing discuss the importance of the watershed approach, adaptive
management and implementation of the rule. See Royal C. Gardner, Joy Zedler,
Ann Redmond, R. Eugene Turner, Carol A. Johnston, Victoria R. Alvarez, Karen L.
Prestegaard, and William J. Mitsch, Compensating for Wetland Losses Under the
Clean Water Act (Redux): Evaluating the Federal Compensatory Mitigation
Regulation, 33 Stetson L. Rev. 213 (2009). For a detailed examination of the
ecosystem focus of the new regulations, see J.B. Ruhl, James Salzman & Iris
Goodman, Implementing the New Ecosystem Services Mandate of the Section 404
Compensatory Mitigation Program - A Catalyst for Advancing Science and Policy,

V.

Mitigation Banking

Although the Corps initially required permittees to undertake compensatory mitigation
projects themselves on land that they owned or would acquire (permittee responsible
mitigation), other mitigation alternatives have gained popularity over time and the 2008
mitigation regulations established a preference for those other alternatives. The major
alternatives to permittee responsible mitigation are mitigation banking and in lieu fee
programs (which will be discussed later in this chapter).
In mitigation banking, a person or entity restores, enhances, creates or preserves
wetlands in a compensatory mitigation project and generates credits that can be used to
satisfy mitigation requirements for a Section 404 permit. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.2. While the
first mitigation banks generated credits that the banker would use to satisfy mitigation
requirements for projects that the banker was undertaking, many mitigation banks today
are entrepreneurial banks, and sell credits to third parties who are engaged in
development projects and need to provide compensatory mitigation as a condition of
obtaining a Section 404 permit.
Although the 1990 MOA between the Corps and EPA provided that mitigation banking
could be an acceptable form of compensatory mitigation, see 1990 MOA § III.C, the MOA
limited the situations in which banking could be used, since the MOA created the
preference for on-site, in-kind mitigation described above. Entrepreneurial banks, by their
nature, will be used to provide mitigation for many different projects and will not generally
be on-site of any of those projects. As the preference for on-site, in-kind mitigation softened
and the Corps developed mitigation banking guidance, see Federal Guidance for the
Establishment, Use and Operation of Mitigation Banks, 68 Fed. Reg. 58605 (Nov. 28,
1995) [hereinafter “Mitigation Banking Guidance”], mitigation banking became much more
popular.
A.

Benefits of Mitigation Banking

Mitigation banking provides benefits for the environment, the government and permit
applicants. As noted above, the National Academy of Sciences raised concerns that many
of the traditional permittee-responsible mitigation projects were not successful. Mitigation
banking addresses that problem because the mitigation banks must meet performance
standards before credits are released and can be used to satisfy permit requirements. See
33 C.F.R. § 332.8. Thus, it is less likely that the mitigation will result in a loss of wetland
functions. In addition, mitigation banks are more likely to generate successful mitigation
because they can bring together money and expertise that the individual permittees would
not be able to access if they were developing mitigation projects on-site separately. See
Mitigation Banking Guidance at 58,607. Mitigation banks can provide additional
environmental benefits compared to a series of separate, smaller mitigation projects, in that
276

“[i]t may be more advantageous for maintaining the integrity of the aquatic ecosystem to
consolidate compensatory mitigation into a single large parcel or contiguous parcels”. Id.
The Corps and EPA benefit from mitigation banking because it is easier to monitor and
enforce mitigation requirements when the mitigation projects are consolidated in a large
parcel or contiguous parcels, as opposed to dozens or hundreds of locations around a
state. Id. Better monitoring and enforcement also benefits the environment, by increasing
the likelihood that the mitigation will be successful. While a 2005 GAO report criticized the
Corps’ monitoring of mitigation banking projects, it concluded that the Corps provided more
oversight for those projects than it provided for the permittee-responsible projects. See
GAO Mitigation Oversight Report, supra.
Finally, permit applicants benefit from mitigation banking because applicants can obtain
permits quicker and at a lower cost if they can obtain credits from a mitigation bank than if
they develop permittee responsible mitigation projects. See Mitigation Banking Guidance at
58,607. Applicants will save time because the Corps should be able to review a mitigation
project involving purchase of credits from a mitigation bank much more quickly than it could
evaluate a site-specific mitigation proposal prepared by the permit applicant. Applicants
should be able to save money because the economies of scale involved in developing a
mitigation bank should make mitigation credits from banks less expensive than on-site
mitigation projects.
Permit applicants also receive another important benefit through mitigation banking. When
a permit applicant satisfies its mitigation requirement by purchasing credits from a
mitigation bank approved by the Corps of Engineers, the Corps will include that as a
condition of the permit and the mitigation banker, rather than the permittee, will be
responsible for the success of the mitigation. The permittee will not be required to provide
alternative mitigation if the bank’s mitigation fails.
Questions and Comments
1.

Size matters: Although the federal guidance suggested that it may be more
advantageous to consolidate mitigation into a larger parcel, environmental
advocates have pointed out that small, isolated wetlands provide unique ecological
and water quality functions and that an assemblage of a series of small wetlands
scattered across a wide geographic area can provide habitat benefits that a single
large wetland cannot provide. See Environmental Law Institute, Banks and Fees:
The Status of Off-Site Wetland Mitigation in the United States 28 (Sept. 2002)
[hereinafter “ELI Mitigation Banking Study”].

277

2.

Success: Despite the benefits outlined above, some studies have suggested that
mitigation banks are no more successful at replacing wetland values and functions
than permittee-responsible mitigation. See Rebecca L. Kihslinger, Success of
Wetland Mitigation Projects, 30:2 National Wetlands Newsletter 14, 15 (2008).

3.

Takings: What effect might a robust mitigation banking system as an option for
compensatory mitigation have on wetland permitting decisions and the likelihood
and success of takings challenges based on Section 404 permit denials? See
Chapter 11, infra, for an extended discussion of regulatory takings.

4.

Limitations: If compensatory mitigation is designed to replace the functions and
values of wetlands that are destroyed or degraded by a Section 404 permitted
activity, can you see where that might be difficult to do in some cases by relying on
mitigation banking? Can mitigation banking be reconciled with the goal of “no net
loss”?

B.

Historical Development

As noted above, the 1990 MOA authorized mitigation banking as a form of compensatory
mitigation, but created some roadblocks to its broad adoption by establishing the on-site,
in-kind mitigation preference. In the early years of mitigation banking, most of the mitigation
banks were single-user banks, where an entity that was engaged in a series of
development projects that required Section 404 permits would develop a large
compensatory mitigation project in advance of those development projects, and would rely
on that project to serve as compensatory mitigation for the Section 404 permits that it would
need to obtain for the future development projects. While some of those early banks were
operated by private developers, most were operated by public entities. By 1992, for
instance, almost half of the mitigation banks in existence were developed by state
departments of transportation for their road development projects. See ELI Mitigation
Banking Study at 15. Congress encouraged this trend by making federal highway funding
available for such mitigation banks in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act
of 1991, Pub. L. 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914 (2001).
Mitigation banking began to gain popularity after the Corps, EPA, the Natural Resources
Conservation Agency and NOAA issued federal mitigation banking guidance in 1995. See
Mitigation Banking Guidance, supra. The guidance identified legal authority for mitigation
banking and outlined a process for review and approval of mitigation banks, creating much
more certainty for prospective mitigation bank developers. Id. It also emphasized that the
agencies’ preference for on-site mitigation should not preclude the use of mitigation
banking when banking is environmentally preferable. Id. § II.D.4.
In 1998, Congress fueled the growth of mitigation banks further by expressing a preference
for their use on federally funded highway projects. See Transportation Equity Act for the
278

21st Century, Pub. L. No. 105-178, 112 Stat. 107 (1998). Between 1993 and 2000, the
number of mitigation banks approved by the Corps of Engineers grew from 44 to more than
230. See Royal C. Gardner, Mitigation in Wetlands Law and Policy: Understanding Section
404 266 (American Bar Association, Section on Environment, Energy and Resources
2005). By 2005, 405 mitigation banks had been approved by the Corps, and 72% of those
were entrepreneurial banks. See Royal C. Gardner, Lawyers, Swamps, and Money 119
(Island Press 2011). Despite the growth in popularity of banks, developers complained that
the agency’s mitigation guidelines placed them at a disadvantage with respect to traditional
permittee-responsible mitigation. According to a 2006 study, permittee-responsible
mitigation still accounted for approximately 60% of wetland mitigation at that time, based on
mitigation acreage. Id. at 140.
In 2008, when the Corps adopted its mitigation regulations, the agency indicated that the
rule applied equivalent standards and criteria to all sources of compensatory mitigation, to
the maximum extent practicable. See 73 Fed. Reg. 19594 (Apr. 10, 2008). However, the
final rules largely abandoned the on-site mitigation preference and created a hierarchy of
preferred methods of compensatory mitigation, with mitigation banking at the top of the
hierarchy. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.3(b). The hierarchy proceeds as follows:






Mitigation Banking
In Lieu Fee Programs
Permittee-responsible mitigation under a watershed approach
Permittee-responsible mitigation through on-site and in-kind mitigation
Permittee-responsible mitigation through off-site and out-of-kind mitigation

Id. Within a few years after the regulations were adopted, the number of banks approved by
the Corps had grown to over 1000. See Royal C. Gardner, Lawyers, Swamps, and Money
119 (Island Press 2011).
C.

Nuts and Bolts of Mitigation Banking

A mitigation bank can only generate credits that can be used for compensatory mitigation if
the bank is authorized to do so by the Corps of Engineers through an approved a
mitigation banking instrument. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.8.
In order to receive approval from the Corps, the bank must prepare a mitigation plan that
includes the same elements described above for permittee-responsible mitigation (i.e.,
objectives, baseline information, work plan, financial assurances, etc.). See 33 C.F.R. §
332.4(c). Mitigation banking instruments are reviewed by an interagency review team
(IRT) that includes representatives of the Corps, EPA, Fish and Wildlife, NOAA, and can
include representatives of state, local and tribal resource agencies in appropriate
279

circumstances. See 40 C.F.R. § 230.98(b).
When a bank is approved by the Corps, it will be approved with a specific geographic
service area, meaning that the credits generated by mitigation from the bank can only be
used as compensatory mitigation for projects within that service area. See 33 C.F.R. §
332.3(b)(2). Normally, mitigation banks can only sell credits for use within the watershed in
which the bank is located. Id. § 332.3(b)(1). While bankers would prefer larger service
areas that include more potential customers, it is more likely that the mitigation provided by
the bank will offset the impacts of the development for which the mitigation is provided
when the bank is located in the same watershed as the development. While banks may be
allowed to sell some credits before their mitigation project has been completed, the
mitigation banking instrument will outline milestones that the bank must meet before issuing
specific amounts of credits. Id. § 332.3(b)(1). The regulations provide that a significant
share of the credits from the bank should be withheld until the bank fully achieves the
ecological performance standards set forth in the banking instrument. See 40 C.F.R. §
230.98(o)(8).
Questions and Comments
1.

Cost of credits: Neither the Corps nor any other agency regulates the cost of
mitigation credits sold by banks. The bank can determine the price that it would like
to charge for the credits and Section 404 permit applicants can decide whether to
buy the credits at that price, buy from another banker at a different price, or develop
their own mitigation proposal. The Ecosystem Marketplace estimates that the
average cost of mitigation credits in 2008 was $74,535 per acre, although the prices
ranged from $3,000 to $653,000 per acre. See Ecosystem Marketplace, U.S.
Wetland Banking. They also estimated that developers spent over $1 billion on
wetland mitigation credits in 2008. Id.

2.

Responsibility: As noted above, when a permit applicant receives approval from
the Corps to satisfy the compensatory mitigation requirements for a Section 404
permit by purchasing credits from a mitigation bank, the bank is then responsible,
rather than the permit applicant, for the success of the mitigation. See 33 C.F.R. §
332.2. Thus, if the mitigation fails, the Corps will not bring an enforcement action
against the permittee for violating the permit conditions and will not require the
permittee to provide alternate mitigation. Instead, the Corps will likely suspend the
mitigation bank’s operation and prevent additional credit releases and sales.

3.

Size: As of 2011, the average size of approved mitigation bank sites was 466 acres,
although the average size varied considerably by region. For instance, the average
size of banks in Minnesota, which had the most approved and operational banks at
that time, was 49 acres, while the average size of banks in Florida was 1,999 acres.

In addition to wetland mitigation banking, several other emerging markets, such as
water quality trading, species conservation banks, and greenhouse gas trading, can
encourage wetland preservation. For an interesting overview of the issues raised by
the commodification of wetlands, see Fred Bosselman, Swamp Swaps: The ‘Second
Nature’ of Wetlands, 39 Envtl. L. 577 (2009). See also, James Salzman & J.B. Ruhl,

Research Problems
Agency Data: The Corps of Engineers maintains an online database of approved
mitigation banks (RIBITS) that permit applicants can use to find mitigation credits for
their projects. Using that database, answer the following questions:
1. How many commercial mitigation banks in Missouri are currently approved to sell
wetland mitigation credits? Remember that single client banks do not sell credits and
remember to focus on banks that sell wetland credits, as the Corps database also
includes banks that sell stream mitigation credits.
2. The Corps of Engineers is requiring a permit applicant in Sturgeon Lake, Minnesota
to provide 1 acre of “shallow marsh” wetlands as mitigation for a project on his
property on Island Lake Road in Sturgeon Lake, Minnesota. Please identify any
mitigation banks that he could contact to buy those credits. It may be helpful to know
that the longitude and latitude coordinates of the property where the project will take
place are 46.415175, -92.730863.

VI.

In Lieu Fee Programs

In lieu fee mitigation programs are the other alternative to traditional permitteeresponsible compensatory mitigation. In this scenario, the Corps authorizes the permittee,
in lieu of implementing a compensatory mitigation project itself, to pay a third party that is
implementing a compensatory mitigation project approved by the Corps. See 33 C.F.R. §
332.2. The entity that is performing the mitigation project must be a government or nonprofit natural resources management entity. Id. Prior to the 2008 regulations, the Corps
frequently entered into Memoranda of Agreement with the government or non-profit entities
to establish guidelines for the mitigation, see Royal C. Gardner, Money for Nothing? The
Rise of Fee Mitigation, 19 Va. Envt’l. L. J. 1, 23-30 (2000), but the responsibilities of the
program sponsors are now governed by the 2008 mitigation regulations. See 73 Fed. Reg.
19594 (Apr. 10, 2008). As with mitigation banking, in lieu fee programs involve “off-site”
compensatory mitigation projects.
A.

Benefits and Concerns

In lieu fee programs are different from mitigation banking programs because, in an in lieu
fee program, the government or non-profit entity usually collects money from several
permittees before implementing a mitigation project, and there could be a significant delay
between the collection of the money and the implementation of the project. See ELI
Mitigation Banking Study at 8. Unlike mitigation banking, even if in lieu fee programs
282

ultimately replace the functions of wetlands that are destroyed or degraded by Section 404
permitted activities, there will generally be temporal losses of wetland functions. Id.
However, in lieu fee programs can be used to restore a variety of wetland types of varying
sizes in varying locations, while mitigation banks usually create, restore, enhance and/or
preserve a single large site. Id. In addition, in lieu fee programs make it easier for the Corps
to require mitigation for some small projects, such as those authorized by nationwide
permits, for which the Corps might not otherwise require mitigation. See Royal C. Gardner,
Lawyers, Swamps, and Money 129 (Island Press 2011).
For Section 404 permit applicants, in lieu fee programs provide the same benefits as
mitigation banking. They make it quicker and cheaper to obtain a permit, see U.S. General
Accounting Office, GAO-01-325, Wetlands Protection: Assessments Needed to Determine
Effectiveness of In-Lieu Fee Mitigation 9 (May 2001) [hereinafter “GAO In Lieu Fee
Report”], and they provide certainty to the permittee by shifting the responsibility for the
success of the mitigation to a third party, the in lieu fee program sponsor.
For the government, to the extent that in lieu fee programs may involve smaller, scattered
mitigation projects, as opposed to large, contiguous projects, in lieu fee programs may not
provide the same monitoring and enforcement efficiency as mitigation banking. However,
by consolidating the mitigation responsibilities in fewer entities with greater resources, the
Corps still achieves a greater level of efficiency in monitoring and enforcement than it would
in permittee-responsible mitigation, see GAO In Lieu Fee Report at 9, and the chances of
mitigation success may be greater due to the greater flexibility that is available to the in lieu
fee program sponsor in selecting a site for the mitigation project. See Environmental Law
Institute, The Status and Character of In Lieu Fee Mitigation in the United States 3 (June
2006).
While in lieu fee programs provide benefits for the environment, the permit applicant, and
the government, they have also been criticized. In a 2001 report, the U.S. General
Accounting Office raised concerns that the in lieu fees that were being collected were not
being used to implement mitigation projects in a timely manner, that the Corps was not
adequately monitoring mitigation projects in the programs, and that the mitigation provided
by the projects was not offsetting the impacts authorized by the Section 404 permits. See
GAO In Lieu Fee Report at 10. Similarly, a 2005 ELI report found that 58 of the 87 in lieu
fee programs that were in place at the time of the study did not require that the funds
collected be spent on mitigation within a specific time frame. See ELI Mitigation Banking
Study at 110. Prior to the adoption of the 2008 regulations, in lieu fee programs were also
criticized because they frequently authorized preservation as a mitigation method. Id. at
119-120 (88% of in lieu fee programs authorized preservation).

283

B.

History and Regulation

The Corps established the first in lieu fee program in the Vicksburg, Mississippi District in
1987, and had established 63 programs throughout the country by September, 2000. See
GAO In Lieu Fee Report at 7.
In 2000, at about the same time that the GAO was issuing its report criticizing in lieu fee
programs, the Corps, EPA, the Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA issued comprehensive
in lieu fee guidance. See Federal Guidance on the Use of In-Lieu-Fee Arrangements for
Compensatory Mitigation under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the
Rivers and Harbors Act (Oct. 2000). By 2005, the Corps had approved 87 programs in 27
states. See ELI Mitigation Banking Study at 99. According to a 2006 study, in lieu fee
programs accounted for about 8.4% of the acreage of compensatory mitigation required in
permits at that time. See Royal C. Gardner, Lawyers, Swamps, and Money 119 (Island
Press 2011).
In lieu fee programs were regulated under the federal guidance document until the Corps
adopted the mitigation regulations in 2008, which superseded the guidance. See 33 C.F.R.
§ 332.1(f)(1). As noted above, the regulations were structured to provide “equivalent”
regulation of all types of compensatory mitigation, but created a hierarchy or preferred
mitigation options, which placed in lieu fee programs below mitigation banking, but above
permittee-responsible mitigation. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.3(b).
The regulations now require in lieu fee programs to be administered pursuant to an in lieu
fee program instrument, similar to mitigation banking instruments, see 33 C.F.R. § 332.2, to
be approved by an interagency review team, similar to mitigation banks, see 40 C.F.R. §
230.98(b), and to prepare mitigation plans that address the same 12 factors as the plans
prepared by mitigation banks and by permittees engaged in permittee-responsible
mitigation (i.e., objectives, baseline information, work plan, financial assurances, etc.). See
33 C.F.R. § 332.4(c). The regulations also require the Corps to identify a geographic
service area in which credits from in lieu fee programs can be used, usually limited to the
watershed in which the mitigation project will take place. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.3(b). As with
mitigation banking, if a permittee is authorized to satisfy its mitigation requirements by
providing funds to an in lieu fee program, the program sponsor, rather than the permittee is
then responsible for the success of the mitigation. See 33 C.F.R. § 332.2. As noted above,
the Corps would then seek relief for any mitigation failure from the in lieu fee program
manager through contract law.
Although the regulations treat in lieu fee programs in a manner that is similar to mitigation
banking in many respects, there is still one important difference between the programs.
Unlike mitigation banks, in lieu fee programs can sell some credits and raise money as
soon as the program instrument has been approved and do not have to wait until the
mitigation project can demonstrate that it has met various milestones. See 33 C.F.R. §
284

332.8(n). As the mitigation project is implemented and meets milestones, the program
sponsors can sell additional advance credits. Id.

Hypothetical
In a 2006 article, Professors J.B. Ruhl and James Salzman pointed out that when a developer
uses mitigation banking, as opposed to on-site, in-kind mitigation, to satisfy mitigation
requirements for Section 404 permits, the environmental and public benefits provided by the
wetlands that are being destroyed are transferred from the area where the development is
taking place to the area where the mitigation bank is located. See J.B. Ruhl & James
Salzman, The Effects of Wetland Mitigation Banking on People, 28 Natl. Wetlands Newsletter
8 (2006). Professors Ruhl and Salzman noted that this often means that development is
destroying wetlands in urban areas and replacing them with wetlands in rural areas. Id.
Mitigation banking, therefore, may raise some environmental justice concerns in its
administration.
Consider that as you read the following dialogue between a lawyer and a client regarding
mitigation requirements for a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit. The client has applied to
the Corps of Engineers for a permit to fill 1 acre of coastal wetlands to build a parking deck in
downtown Mobile, Alabama.

285

Scene: Lawyers Office in downtown Mobile, Alabama
Lawyer: Thanks for stopping by this morning. I know that you're busy, but I just wanted to
update you on your permit application.
Client: Great. I've been sitting on that swampland for years. It will be great to finally get
some money out of it.
Lawyer: Well, you'll be happy to know that the Corps will probably grant your permit for the
parking deck, but we just need to come to some agreement on the mitigation requirements.
Client: OK. So what are my options? The last time we talked about this, you told me that the
Corps wanted me to clean up some of the other wetlands near my property or build new ones
near my property. I think you said that they wanted 4 acres of wetlands to make up for the 1
that I was filling. Is that still what they want?
Lawyer: They still would prefer that mitigation, but they are also willing to allow you to buy
mitigation credits from the South Alabama Mitigation Bank in Citronelle, Alabama. If you
bought credits from the mitigation bank, it would cost about $80,000 for the credits.
Client: That sounds better than the $100,000 it was going to cost me to clean up or build
swamps near my property.
Lawyer: I agree that credits from the mitigation bank will be less expensive, but I think that
there are some other factors that you might want to consider in choosing the mitigation.
When we discussed mitigation with the Corps before, they were exploring the on-site options
because a lot of the coastal wetlands around Mobile are being developed and they felt that
restoration or creation of wetlands on or near your property would help prevent flooding in
Mobile and would help protect the shrimp fisheries in the Mobile Bay. The South Alabama
Mitigation bank is located about 40 miles north of Mobile, so the wetlands that they have
created and restored up there won't really provide any protection to the fisheries or to the
folks who might be flooded by storms in the Mobile Bay. That's been happening a lot here in
Alabama. Wetlands are being destroyed by development in the cities and being replaced by
wetlands in mitigation banks in rural areas. Then, when the flooding hits, the cities get hit
hard.
Client: Would my parking deck be affected by flooding?
Lawyer: It's hard to tell, but I think that you've got it designed and located so that any impacts
should be minimal. Plus, we've got some good insurance lined up for it.
Client: Well, I don't see why I should worry about the fisheries or flooding, then. Besides, how
much of an impact can my project have, anyway? I'm only filling an acre of swamp for my
parking deck.

286

Lawyer: Yes, but lots of people are only filling an acre or a couple acres by the bay. Before
you know it, half of our wetlands are gone. Which is why I think that there are benefits to
restoring or creating wetlands near your property.
Client: I hired you to represent me and not the citizens of Mobile or the Gulf Coast
Shrimpers Union. All I'm concerned about is that I get my permit at the lowest cost without
violating any laws. If I buy the mitigation credits, that will be legal, and I won't be sued by
anyone when I build my parking deck?
Lawyer: If you buy the mitigation credits, the Corps will issue you the permit and you won't
be sued by the government as long as you comply with the permit. The government's
regulations actually create a preference for mitigation banking, but they allow on-site
mitigation when the mitigation would restore an outstanding resource, like it would in your
case. The Clean Water Act allows citizens to sue for some violations of the law, but they
won’t be able to sue you as long as you have a permit from the Corps to build your parking
deck.
You may be able to buy some good will with the Mobile community, though, by restoring or
creating some wetlands near your property instead of just buying mitigation credits. If you
do a good job on the mitigation, it could really make the area around the parking deck look
nice and it might make folks want to park in your parking deck instead of some of the other
decks downtown. It could look like a little nature preserve in the middle of an urban jungle.
Client: Location is everything with parking decks. If I'm near where folks need to park, I'll
get folks parking in my garage. If I'm not, I won't. I don't think that building some swamps
near my garage is going to increase my business. Besides, I've never built swamps. What
happens if they don't work the way they're supposed to? Won't the government come after
me then?
Lawyer: Well, you're right that if we go with the on-site mitigation option and the restoration
or creation doesn't work, the Corps can ask you to provide alternative mitigation. You don't
have to worry about that with the mitigation bank. Once you buy the credits from an
approved bank and the Corps signs off on that in your permit, you won't be responsible for
providing any other mitigation if the mitigation bank's mitigation doesn't work.
Client: Well, it sounds like a no-brainer, then. Let's go with the credits from the mitigation
bank and get that permit, so that we can start building the garage.
Lawyer: OK. I'll contact the Corps this afternoon. I'll let you know if anything else comes up.

Questions
1. Is it appropriate for the lawyer to raise concerns about the fisheries or flooding, or business
concerns (such as the potential increased use of the garage if the area around the garage looks
like a nature preserve) in counseling the client? See American Bar Association, Model Rule of
Professional Conduct 2.1. (and associated comments); David Dana, Environmental Lawyers
and the Public Service Model of Lawyering, 74 Or. L. Rev. 57 (1995)
2. If the lawyer strongly disagreed with the client’s mitigation choice, would it be appropriate for
the lawyer to withdraw from representing the client? See American Bar Association, Model Rule
of Professional Conduct 1.16 (and associated comments)

EPA’s Role in Permitting and EPA’s Veto
Authority
I.

EPA’s Role in the Section 404 Permitting Process

As a result of Congressional compromises, the Clean Water Act vests significant authority
for administering and enforcing the Section 404 permit program in the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In general, the two agencies
have significantly different missions, so it is not surprising that they have adopted
conflicting positions, at times, in interpreting and administering the Section 404 program.
While the Corps administers the permitting program on a day to day basis and has the
ultimate authority to issue or deny Section 404 permits, Congress gave EPA several
important duties and responsibilities with respect to the program. First, Congress gave
EPA the authority, in conjunction with the Corps, to write the 404(b)(1) Guidelines, which
are the rules that the Corps uses to review permit applications when determining whether
to issue or deny permits and when determining the conditions to include in those permits.
See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(b)(1). The Guidelines were described in detail in Chapters 6 and 7 of
this book. Second, EPA provides comments to the Corps of Engineers during the permit
review process regarding the agency’s views on the application of the Guidelines to the
permit application, whether the permit should be issued or denied, and any conditions that
should be included in the permit, if issued. EPA’s role in the permitting process was
outlined in detail in Chapter 6 of this book. Third, while the Corps may have the ultimate
authority to issue or deny Section 404 permits, EPA is authorized to veto permits and
prohibit discharges of dredged or fill material in specific areas regardless of whether the
Corps determines a discharge is appropriate. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(c). Not surprisingly, in
light of this authority, the Corps must give significant weight to the comments that EPA
provides during the Section 404 permit review process. EPA’s veto authority is discussed in
the next section of this Chapter. Fourth, the Clean Water Act authorizes both the Corps,
see 33 U.S.C. § 1344(s), and EPA, see 33 U.S.C. § 1319, to bring administrative actions
and to refer judicial actions to the Department of Justice to enforce the Section 404
permitting program. Those authorities, and the manner in which the agencies have divided
those responsibilities, are discussed in Chapter 10 of this book. In addition to the powers
outlined above, EPA also has authority, with the Corps, to determine whether a site is
within federal jurisdiction as “waters of the United States.” Chapter 4 of this book outlined
the manner in which the Corps and EPA have divided that responsibility.
289

In order to facilitate efficient and timely processing of Section 404 permits by the Corps,
Congress directed EPA and the other agencies routinely involved in review of those permits
to enter into agreements with the Corps to “minimize ... duplication, needless paperwork,
and delays in the issuance of [Section 404] permits.” See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(q). The
agreement that EPA entered into with the Corps also includes dispute resolution provisions
to address the inevitable disagreements between the agencies in the permit review
process. The Section 404(q) MOA and dispute resolution processes are discussed in the
next section of this Chapter.
II.

EPA’s Veto Authority

A.

Authority and Procedures

Although Section 404(c) is often referred to as EPA’s “veto” authority, that provision grants
EPA broader authority to limit discharges of dredged of fill material than simply the authority
to “veto” a Section 404 permit. Section 404(c) provides:
The Administrator is authorized to prohibit the specification (including the withdrawal
of specification) of any defined area as a disposal site, and he is authorized to deny
or restrict the use of any defined area for specification (including the withdrawal of
specification) as a disposal site, whenever he determines, after notice and
opportunity for public hearings, that the discharge of such materials into such area
will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds
and fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas), wildlife, or recreational
areas.
33 U.S.C. § 1344(c). Thus, while EPA usually uses its Section 404(c) authority to veto
permits issued by the Corps, the agency has the authority to prohibit, deny, restrict, or
withdraw the specification of an area as a disposal site in a variety of contexts. EPA
retains that authority even if a State takes over administration of the Section 404 permit
program. See 40 C.F.R. § 231.1.

Section 404(q) and Elevation of
Permit Disputes

Resources
EPA/Corps 404(q) MOA
EPA 404(q) fact sheet
Chronology of 404(q) elevations
EPA web page of 404(q) resources

Although EPA has only exercised its
Section 404(c) authority 13 times in the
history of the Section 404 program, see
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
Chronology of 404(c) Actions, it usually
exercises it to “veto” a permit that the Corps is about to issue or has issued. In most cases,
EPA has raised concerns about the permitted activity during the comment period, before
290

the Corps has decided to issue the permit.
EPA permit vetoes are rare. In the vast majority of cases, EPA and the Corps work out any
disagreements that they have regarding the issuance or denial of a permit, and the
conditions to be included in a permit, at the field level. However, when disputes arise
between the agencies at the field level, the disputes can be “elevated” to higher levels
within the agencies for resolution pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement that EPA and
the Corps signed in 1992 to comply with Section 404(q) of the Clean Water Act. See U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency & U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Memorandum of
Agreement: Clean Water Act Section 404(q) [hereinafter “1992 MOA”].
Under the MOA, if EPA is concerned that a project may result in “substantial and
unacceptable impacts to “aquatic resources of national importance” (ARNI), regional
representatives of the agency must notify the Corps’ District Engineer about those
concerns during the comment period for the permit for the project. Id. ¶ IV.3.(a). In
determining whether a site is an ARNI, EPA examines the economic importance of the
resource, its rarity or uniqueness, and/or the importance of the resource to the protection,
maintenance or enhancement of the quality of the nation’s waters. See U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Section 404(q) Dispute Resolution Process. If EPA and the Corps
cannot work out their differences, the EPA Regional Administrator can send a letter to the
Corps District Engineer (within 25 days after the comment period ends), indicating that the
project will have substantial and unacceptable impacts to an ARNI. See 1992 MOA ¶
IV.3.(b).
If the Corps plans to issue the permit for the project regardless of EPA’s concerns, the
District Engineer must notify the EPA Regional Administrator, and the Regional
Administrator can ask EPA headquarters (EPA Assistant Administrator) to request review
(elevation) of the dispute by the Corps’ headquarters (Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil
Works)). Id. ¶ IV.3. Although the Corps will not issue the permit during the elevation review
process, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) can ultimately decide that the
permit should be issued after reviewing the dispute. Id. The Assistant Secretary might also
decide that the permit should not be issued, or that it should be issued with specific
conditions, and might provide case specific guidance for the agency. Id. When the
Assistant Secretary makes a decision, the Assistant Secretary should immediately notify
EPA’s Assistant Administrator. Id. If the Corps determines that it will issue the section 404
permit regardless of EPA’s concerns, EPA must then decide whether to begin the Section
404(c) veto process.
Just as it is unusual for EPA to veto a Corps permit, it is unusual for EPA and the Corps to
be unable to resolve their differences regarding a permit application at the regional level.
While the Corps processes approximately 60,000 permits per year, EPA has only sought
elevation of Corps permits 11 times in the 20 years since the agencies entered into the
Section 404(q) MOA, and 8 times before they signed the MOA. See U.S. Environmental
291

Section 404(c) Procedures

Resources
EPA Section 404(c) regulations
EPA Section 404(c) fact sheet
Chronology of EPA Section 404(c) actions

Section 404(c) requires EPA, before
making a decision to prohibit, deny,
restrict, or withdraw specification of an
area as a disposal site, to consult with the
Corps. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(c). The
statute also requires EPA to “set forth in
writing and make public [the] ... findings and reasons” for making those decisions. Id. EPA
has adopted regulations to implement those requirements. See 40 C.F.R. Part 231. The
regulations outline a three step process that applies regardless of whether EPA is vetoing a
permit or prohibiting, denying, restricting, or withdrawing specification of a disposal area in
other contexts. See 40 C.F.R. § 231.1. Normally, though, EPA uses its 404 (c) authority
when the agency and the Corps have not been able to work out disagreements regarding a
Section 404 permit application and the Corps has issued a notice that it intends to issue the
permit. The elevation process and the 404(c) process are separate processes, and there is
no requirement that EPA attempt to resolve disagreements with the Corps through formal
elevation before commencing the 404(c) process.
292

Section 404(c) Process
Notice of Proposed Determination
↓
Recommended Determination
↓
Final Determination

The Section 404(c) process begins at the regional level of EPA. If a Regional Administrator
of EPA finds that a discharge of dredged or fill material will have “unacceptable adverse
effects” on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or
recreational areas, the Administrator notifies the Corps that the Administrator intends to
issue a public notice of a proposed determination to withdraw, prohibit, deny or restrict the
specification of the area as a disposal site. See 40 C.F.R. §231.3(a)(1). If EPA is beginning
the process because someone is seeking a permit from the Corps to discharge in the area,
the Regional Administrator notifies the permit applicant as well. Id. Unless it is
demonstrated to the Regional Administrator that the discharge won’t have unacceptable
adverse effects, within 15 days after notifying the Corps and any permit applicant that it
intends to issue a notice, the Administrator publishes, in the Federal Register, a Notice of
Proposed Determination to withdraw, prohibit, deny, or restrict the area as a disposal site.
Id. § 231.3(a)(2). If EPA begins the process while the Corps is reviewing a permit
application for the site, the Corps will not issue the permit until EPA finishes the 404(c)
process. Id. See also 33 C.F.R. § 323.6(b).
After EPA publishes the notice of proposed determination, the agency provides an
opportunity for public comment on the notice and may hold a public hearing. See 40 C.F.R.
§ 231.4. At the end of the comment period, the Regional Administrator either withdraws the
proposed determination or forwards a Recommended Determination (and administrative
record for the determination) to EPA headquarters (the EPA Assistant Administrator for
Water). See 40 C.F.R. § 231.5. Within 30 days after the EPA Assistant Administrator
receives the recommended determination, the Assistant Administrator contacts the Corps,
the property owner, and the permit applicant (if there is a permit application), so that they
can take “corrective action” to prevent unacceptable adverse effects. See 40 C.F.R. §
231.6. Within 60 days after the Assistant Administrator receives the recommended
determination from the Regional Administrator, the Assistant Administrator must issue, and
publish in the Federal Register, a Final Determination affirming, modifying, or rescinding
the recommended determination. Id.

Questions and Comments
1.

Judicial Review: Which of the following actions are reviewable final agency
actions?: (1) a Regional Administrator’s Proposed Determination; (2) a Regional
Administrator’s Withdrawal of a Proposed Determination; (3) a Regional
Administrator’s Recommended Determination; (4) a Final Determination of the
Assistant Administrator. See 40 C.F.R. part 231. What if EPA never initiates the
404(c) process at all? Is the agency’s failure to veto a permit or failure to initiate the
404(c) process with respect to a disposal site reviewable? Compare Preserve
Endangered Areas of Cobb’s History, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 87 F.3d
1242 (11th Cr. 1996) (EPA’s decision whether to exercise its 404 (c) authority is
discretionary and can’t be challenged in a citizen suit) with National Wildlife
Federation v. Hanson, 859 F.2d 313 (4th Cir. 1988) (EPA has a non-discretionary
duty to exercise its 404(c) authority when the Corps has made an erroneous wetland
determination) and Alliance to Save Mattaponi v. United States Army Corps of
Engineers, 515 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2007) (EPA’s failure to exercise its 404(c)
authority cannot be challenged in a citizen suit, but can be challenged under the
Administrative Procedures Act).

2.

Nature of hearings: Section 404(c) requires EPA to make determinations “after
notice and opportunity for public hearings.” Does that language require the agency
to hold formal trial-type hearings before an administrative law judge? How has the
agency interpreted the language? See 40 C.F.R. § 231.4. How does that impact the
standard of review that applies to the factual determinations made by EPA in a final
determination under section 404 (c)? See James City County v. Environmental
Protection Agency, 12 F.3d 1330 (4th Cir. 1993) (relying on the arbitrary and
capricious standard after previously applying the substantial evidence standard).

3.

Frequency: EPA exercises its 404(c) authority sparingly. It has only issued 13
vetoes since 1972, and did not issue any veto decisions over an 18 year period
between 1990 and 2008. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Chronology of
404(c) Actions. While EPA vetoed 11 projects between 1981 and 1990, the decline
in permit vetoes was likely influenced by two factors. First, several bills were
introduced in Congress in the early 1990s that would have eliminated EPA’s Section
404(c) authority. See, e.g., Wetlands Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, 104th Cong.,
1st Sess. (1995); Wetlands Protection and Regulatory Reform Act of 1991, H.R. 404,
102d Cong., 1st Sess (1991). Second, and perhaps more importantly, in 1992, EPA
entered into the MOA with the Corps establishing the elevation procedures, which
provide a process to resolve inter-agency disputes which might otherwise lead to
permit vetoes. See 1992 MOA.

Research Problems
EPA posts the proposed and final determinations in the 404(c) process on its website.

2. When EPA vetoed the Two Forks Water Supply Impoundments permit in Colorado,
was it concerned about the impacts of the project on (a) fisheries; (b) municipal water
supplies; or (c) wildlife?

Timing of the “Veto”

As noted above, while EPA normally uses its authority under Section 404(c) to veto a
permit that the Corps plans to issue or has already issued, the statutory language does
not limit EPA’s exercise of authority to those situations. The statute does not refer to a
“veto” at all. Instead, it authorizes EPA to prohibit, deny, restrict or withdraw the
specification of a defined area as a disposal site. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(c). EPA has
interpreted that language, through regulation, to mean that the agency can exercise its
authority before anyone applies for a permit, while the Corps is processing a permit
application, and after the Corps issues a permit. See U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Clean Water Act Section 404 (c) “Veto Authority”. Below are EPA’s regulatory
definitions that support that broad exercise of authority.

Statutory Term

Regulatory Definition

Prohibit Specification

Prevent the designation of an area as a present or
future disposal site - 40 C.F.R. § 231.2(b).

Deny or Restrict the Use
of Any Defined Area for
Specification

Deny or restrict the use of any area for the present or
future discharge of any dredged or fill material - 40
C.F.R. § 231.2(c).

Withdraw Specification

Remove from designation an area already specified as
a disposal site by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or
by a state which has assumed the Section 404
program, or any portion of such area - 40 C.F.R. §
231.2(a).

While the agency’s regulations authorize EPA to exercise its Section 404(c) powers in a
broad range of situations, in most cases, EPA exercises its authority when the Corps is
reviewing a Section 404 permit application and is likely to issue the permit, but has not
yet issued the permit. 10 of the 13 EPA “vetoes” arose in that context. See Brief for the
Respondent in Opposition to Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 14, Mingo Logan Coal
Company v. Environmental Protection Agency, No. 13-599 (U.S. Feb. 14, 2014). In the
other 3 cases, EPA acted to limit the use of an area as a disposal site after the Corps had
issued a permit authorizing the discharge. Id. at 5. In 2 of those cases, EPA acted shortly
after the permit was issued or when a permit modification was being sought. Id. In one
case, however, EPA exercised its Section 404(c) authority four years after the Corps
issued a Section 404 permit for a mountaintop removal mining project. That was EPA’s
most recent exercise of its authority and was challenged in the following case.

The Mingo Logan Coal Company
(Mingo Logan) applied to the United
States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) for a permit under section 404 of the Clean Water
Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. § 1344, to discharge dredged or fill material from a mountain-top coal
mine in West Virginia into three streams and their tributaries. The Corps—acting on behalf
296

of the Secretary of the Army (Secretary) and without objection from the Administrator of the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (Administrator, EPA), who has “veto”
authority over discharge site selection under CWA subsection 404(c), * * * issued the
permit to Mingo Logan, approving the requested disposal sites for the discharged material.
Four years later, EPA invoked its subsection 404(c) authority to “withdraw” the
specifications of two of the streams as disposal sites, thereby prohibiting Mingo Logan from
discharging into them. Mingo Logan filed this action challenging EPA’s withdrawal of the
specified sites on the grounds that (1) EPA lacks statutory authority to withdraw site
specification after a permit has issued and (2) EPA’s decision to do so was arbitrary and
capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.
The district court granted summary judgment to Mingo Logan on the first ground without
reaching the second. We reverse the district court, concluding that EPA has post-permit
withdrawal authority, and remand for further proceedings.
I.
The CWA provides that “the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful”
except as in compliance with specifically enumerated CWA provisions, including section
404. * * * Subsection 404(a) authorizes the Secretary to issue permits allowing discharge
of dredged or fill material “at specified disposal sites,” which are to be “specified for each
such permit by the Secretary . . . through the application of guidelines developed by the
Administrator, in conjunction with the Secretary.” * * * The Secretary’s authority to specify a
disposal site is expressly made “[s]ubject to subsection (c) of [section 404].” * * *
Subsection 404(c) authorizes the Administrator, after consultation with the Corps, to veto
the Corps’s disposal site specification—that is, the Administrator “is authorized to prohibit
the specification (including the withdrawal of specification) of any defined area as a
disposal site, and . . . to deny or restrict the use of any defined area for specification
(including the withdrawal of specification) as a disposal site”—“whenever he determines”
the discharge will have an “unacceptable adverse effect” on identified environmental
resources. * * *
In June 1999, Hobet Mining, Inc., Mingo Logan’s predecessor, applied for a section 404
permit to discharge material from the Spruce No. 1 Mine into four West Virginia streams
and their tributaries. In 2002, after the Corps prepared a draft Environmental Impact
Statement, EPA expressed its concern that “even with the best practices, mountaintop
mining yields significant and unavoidable environmental impacts that had not been
adequately described in the document.” * * * In the end, however, EPA declined to pursue
a subsection 404(c) objection. * * * On January 22, 2007, the Corps issued Mingo Logan a
section 404 permit, effective through December 31, 2031, which authorized Mingo Logan to
dispose of material into three streams—Pigeonroost Branch, Oldhouse Branch and Seng
Camp Creek—and certain tributaries thereto. * * * The permit expressly advised that the
Corps “may reevaluate its decision on the permit at any time the circumstances warrant”
and that “[s]uch a reevaluation may result in a determination that it is appropriate to use the
297

suspension, modification, and revocation procedures contained in 33 C.F.R. 325.7.” * * *
The permit made no mention of any future EPA action.
On September 3, 2009, EPA wrote the Corps requesting it “use its discretionary authority
provided by 33 C.F.R. 325.7 to suspend, revoke or modify the permit issued authorizing
Mingo Logan Coal Company to discharge dredged and/or fill material into waters of the
United States in conjunction with the construction, operation, and reclamation of the Spruce
Fork No. 1 Surface Mine,” based on “new information and circumstances . . . which
justif[ied] reconsideration of the permit.” * * * EPA noted in particular its “concern[] about
the project’s potential to degrade downstream water quality.” * * * The Corps responded
that there were “no factors that currently compell[ed it] to consider permit suspension,
modification or revocation.” * * * EPA wrote back: “We intend to issue a public notice of a
proposed determination to restrict or prohibit the discharge of dredged and/or fill material at
the Spruce No. 1 Mine project site consistent with our authority under Section 404(c) of the
Clean Water Act and our regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 231.” * * *
EPA’s Regional Director published the promised notice of proposed determination on April
2, 2010, requesting public comments “[p]ursuant to Section 404(c) . . . on its proposal to
withdraw or restrict use of Seng Camp Creek, Pigeonroost Branch, Oldhouse Branch, and
certain tributaries to those waters in Logan County, West Virginia to receive dredged and/or
fill material in connection with construction of the Spruce No. 1 Surface Mine.” * * * The
Regional Director followed up with a Recommended Determination on September 24,
2010, limited to withdrawal of the specification of Pigeonroost Branch and Oldhouse Branch
and their tributaries. On January 13, 2011, EPA published its Final Determination, which,
adopting the Regional Director’s recommendation, formally “withdraws the specification of
Pigeonroost Branch, Oldhouse Branch, and their tributaries, as described in [the Spruce
Mine Permit] . . . as a disposal site for the discharge of dredged or fill material for the
purpose of construction, operation, and reclamation of the Spruce No. 1 Surface Mine” and
“prohibits the specification of the defined area . . . for use as a disposal site associated with
future surface coal mining that would be expected to result in a nature and scale of adverse
chemical, physical, and biological effects similar to the Spruce No. 1 mine.” * * *
Mingo Logan filed this action in district court immediately following the Proposed
Determination, challenging EPA’s authority to “revoke” the three-year-old permit, * * * and
amended its complaint in February 2011 to challenge the Final Determination, asserting it
is both ultra vires and arbitrary and capricious. * * * On cross-motions for summary
judgment, the district court granted judgment to Mingo Logan on March 23, 2012. * * * The
court concluded EPA “exceeded its authority under section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act
when it attempted to invalidate an existing permit by withdrawing the specification of certain
areas as disposal sites after a permit had been issued by the Corps under section 404(a).”
* * * The United States filed a timely notice of appeal on behalf of EPA. The Corps joined
EPA on brief. * * *

II.
In granting summary judgment, the district court agreed with Mingo Logan’s interpretation
of subsection 404 to preclude EPA from withdrawing a site specification once the Corps
has issued a permit. “We review a grant of summary judgment de novo applying the same
standards as those that govern the district court’s determination.” Troy Corp. v. Browner,
120 F.3d 277, 283 (D.C. Cir. 1997). “Moreover, insofar as the agency’s determination
amounts to or involves its interpretation of . . . a statute entrusted to its administration, we
review that interpretation under the deferential standard of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).” Id. Under Chevron:
We first ask “whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at
issue,” in which case we “must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of
Congress.” If the “statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,”
however, we move to the second step and defer to the agency’s interpretation as
long as it is “based on a permissible construction of the statute.”
Natural Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 706 F.3d 428, 431 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting Chevron,
467 U.S. at 842–43). We construe subsection 404(c) under Chevron step 1 because we
believe the language unambiguously expresses the intent of the Congress.
As noted earlier, * * * section 404 vests the Corps, rather than EPA, with the authority to
issue permits to discharge fill and dredged material into navigable waters and to specify the
disposal sites therefor. * * * Nonetheless, the Congress granted EPA a broad
environmental “backstop” authority over the Secretary’s discharge site selection in
subsection 404(c), which provides in full:
(c) Denial or restriction of use of defined areas as disposal sites
The Administrator is authorized to prohibit the specification (including the withdrawal
of specification) of any defined area as a disposal site, and he is authorized to deny
or restrict the use of any defined area for specification (including the withdrawal of
specification) as a disposal site, whenever he determines, after notice and
opportunity for public hearings, that the discharge of such materials into such area
will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds
and fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas), wildlife, or recreational
areas. Before making such determination, the Administrator shall consult with the
Secretary. The Administrator shall set forth in writing and make public his findings
and his reasons for making any determination under this subsection.
33 U.S.C. § 1344(c); see Legislative History at 177 (“[T]he Conferees agreed that the
Administrator . . . should have the veto over the selection of the site for dredged spoil

299

disposal and over any specific spoil to be disposed of in any selected site.”). 2 Section 404
imposes no temporal limit on the Administrator’s authority to withdraw the Corps’s
specification but instead expressly empowers him to prohibit, restrict or withdraw the
specification “whenever” he makes a determination that the statutory “unacceptable
adverse effect” will result. 33 U.S.C. § 1344(c) (emphasis added). Using the expansive
conjunction “whenever,” the Congress made plain its intent to grant the Administrator
authority to prohibit/deny/restrict/withdraw a specification at any time. See 20 Oxford
English Dictionary 210 (2d ed.1989) (defining “whenever,” used in “a qualifying (conditional)
clause,” as: “At whatever time, no matter when.”). Thus, the unambiguous language of
subsection 404(c) manifests the Congress’s intent to confer on EPA a broad veto power
extending beyond the permit issuance.3
2

Thus, subsection 404(c) affords EPA two distinct (if overlapping) powers to veto the
Corps’s specification: EPA may (1) “prohibit the specification (including the withdrawal of
specification) of any defined area as a disposal site” or (2) “deny or restrict the use of any
defined area for specification (including the withdrawal of specification).” In withdrawing the
specifications here, EPA did not clearly distinguish between the two powers. See Final
Determination, 76 Fed. Reg. at 3127 (“EPA Region III published in the Federal Register a
Proposed Determination to prohibit, restrict, or deny the specification or the use for
specification (including withdrawal of specification) of certain waters at the project site as
disposal sites for the discharge of dredged or fill material for the construction of the Spruce
No. 1 Surface Mine.”). It appears, however, that EPA exercised the first authority—“to
prohibit”/“withdraw[]”—given the post-permit timing. See id. at 3128 (“EPA’s Final
Determination withdraws the specification of Pigeonroost Branch, Oldhouse Branch, and
their tributaries, as described in DA Permit No. 199800436-3 (Section 10: Coal River), as a
disposal site for the discharge of dredged or fill material for the purpose of construction,
operation, and reclamation of the Spruce No. 1 Surface Mine. This Final Determination also
prohibits the specification of the defined area constituting Pigeonroost Branch, Oldhouse
Branch, and their tributaries for use as a disposal site associated with future surface coal
mining that would be expected to result in a nature and scale of adverse chemical,
physical, and biological effects similar to the Spruce No. 1 mine.”).
3

Based on the plain meaning of the statutory language, EPA has consistently maintained
this interpretation for over thirty years. See Section 404(c) Procedures, 44 Fed. Reg.
58,076, 58,077 (Oct. 9, 1979) (“The statute on its face clearly allows EPA to act after the
Corps has issued a permit; it refers twice to the ‘withdrawal of specification,’ which clearly
refers to action by EPA after the Corps has specified a site (e.g. issued a permit or
authorized its own work).”); Final Determination of the Administrator Concerning the North
Miami Landfill Site Pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act at 1-2 (Jan. 26, 1981)
(JA 239-40) (exercising 404(c) authority “to restrict the use of [of the North Miami Landfill]
for specification (including the withdrawal of specification) as a disposal site” almost five
years after Corps issued permit therefor). The Corps has made clear by joining EPA in this
litigation that it agrees with EPA’s interpretation. See supra * * * .
300

This construction is further buttressed by subsection 404(c)’s authorization of a “withdrawal”
which, as EPA notes, is “a term of retrospective application.” * * * EPA can withdraw a
specification only after it has been made. See 20 Oxford English Dictionary 449 (2d
ed.1989) (defining “withdraw” as “[t]o take back or away (something that has been given,
granted, allowed, possessed, enjoyed, or experienced)”). Moreover, because the Corps
often specifies final disposal sites in the permit itself—at least it did here, * * * —EPA’s
power to withdraw can only be exercised post-permit. Mingo Logan’s reading of the statute
would eliminate EPA’s express statutory right to withdraw a specification and thereby
render subsection 404(c)’s parenthetical “withdrawal” language superfluous—a result to be
avoided. See Corley v. United States, 556 U.S. 303, 314 (2009) (applying “one of the most
basic interpretative canons, that a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all
its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant”)
(brackets and quotation marks omitted).
Notwithstanding the unambiguous statutory language, Mingo Logan presses its own view of
the language, the statutory structure and section 404’s legislative history to maintain that
the Congress intended to preclude post-permit withdrawal. We find none of its arguments
persuasive.
First, Mingo Logan argues that the statutory language itself contemplates that specification
occurs before (rather than when) the permit issues and therefore can (and must) be
withdrawn pre-permit. We find no such intent in the statutory directive Mingo Logan
quotes—that “each such disposal site shall be specified for each such permit by the
Secretary . . . through the application of guidelines developed by the Administrator, in
conjunction with the Secretary.” 33 U.S.C. § 1344(b). This language is at least as
consistent with specification by the Corps at the time the permit issues as it is with prepermit specification. Moreover, as noted earlier, * * * the Corps expressly “specified” the
final sites in the Spruce Mine Permit itself. Nor does the permitting process—including the
“extensive coordination process during which EPA can review the Corps’s statement of
findings/record of decision,” * * * require that the specification be made before the permit
issues. During the permitting process, the disposal sites are proposed, reviewed—perhaps
even “specified,” as Mingo Logan contends—but the final specifications are included in the
permit itself.
Second, Mingo Logan asserts EPA’s interpretation conflicts with section 404 “as a whole.”
* * * Mingo Logan claims, for example, that “EPA’s reading obliterates the choice Congress
made to give the permitting authority with all of its attributes to the Corps, not EPA.” * * *
While it is true that subsections 404(a)-(b) unambiguously authorize the Secretary to issue
a discharge permit—and to specify the disposal site(s) therefor—section 404(b) makes
equally clear * * * that the Administrator has, in effect, the final say on the specified
disposal sites “whenever” he makes the statutorily required “unacceptable adverse effect”
determination. Thus, insofar as site specification may be considered, as Mingo Logan
301

asserts, an “attribute[]” of the permitting authority, the statute expressly vests final authority
over this particular attribute in the Administrator.
Mingo Logan also contends that EPA’s interpretation “tramples on provisions like sections
404(p) and 404(q) that are intended to give permits certainty and finality.” * * * Subsection
404(p) provides: “Compliance with a permit issued pursuant to [section 404], including any
activity carried out pursuant to a general permit issued under this section, shall be deemed
compliance, for purposes of [enforcement actions brought under] sections 1319 and 1365
of [title 33] . . . .”4 According to Mingo Logan, “absent . . . permit violations or public interest
considerations, the permittee can rely on the permit shield of section 404(p).” * * * But
again, section 404(c)’s language is plain with regard to its enumerated “unacceptable
adverse effects”: the Administrator retains authority to withdraw a specified disposal site
“whenever” he determines such effects will result from discharges at the sites. And when he
withdraws a disposal site specification, as he did here, the disposal site’s “terms and
conditions specified” in the permit * * * are in effect amended so that discharges at the
previously specified disposal sites are no longer in “[c]ompliance with” the permit—although
the permit itself remains otherwise in effect to the extent it is usable. 5 Moreover, as EPA
notes, subsection 404(c) was enacted in 1972 and its plain meaning did not change when
404(p) was enacted five years later. * * * As Mingo Logan acknowledges, if “the text of
section 404(c) clearly and unambiguously gave EPA the power to act post-permit”—a
reading it rejects—then section 404(p) “cannot be read to implicitly overturn section 404(c).”
* * * As we have repeatedly stated throughout this opinion, the text of section 404(c) does
indeed clearly and unambiguously give EPA the power to act post-permit. Thus, subsection
404(p) does not implicitly limit section 404(c)’s scope. Nor does EPA’s express statutory
authority to act post-permit interfere with subsection 404(q)’s directive that the Secretary
enter into agreements with other agency heads “to minimize, to the maximum extent
4

Sections 1319 and 1365 of title 33 authorize an action by, respectively, (1) EPA against a
violator of, inter alia, the terms of a section 404 permit; and (2) a citizen against a violator of
a CWA effluent limitation or against EPA for failure to perform a non-discretionary “act or
duty” under the CWA. 33 U.S.C. §§ 1319, 1365.
5

In this case for example, EPA left intact the specification as disposal site of “the Right
Fork of Seng Camp Creek and its tributaries . . . in part because some of those discharges
have already occurred and because the stream resources in Right Fork of Seng Camp
Creek were subject to a higher level of historic and ongoing human disturbance than those
found in Pigeonroost Branch or Oldhouse Branch.” Final Determination, 76 Fed. Reg. at
3127 n.1.
In addition, EPA has made clear that a permittee may not be penalized for discharges that
occurred in compliance with the permit before the effective date of the withdrawal of the
specification.
302

practicable, duplication, needless paperwork, and delays in the issuance of permits under
this section” and “to assure that, to the maximum extent practicable, a decision with respect
to an application for a permit under subsection (a) of this section will be made not later than
the ninetieth day after the date the notice for such application is published under subsection
(a) of this section.” 33 U.S.C. § 1344(q) (emphases added). The enumerated obligations
apply only pre-permit and are therefore unaffected by EPA’s post-permit actions.
Finally, Mingo Logan argues that the legislative history “confirms that Congress intended
EPA to act under section 404(c), if at all, prior to permit issuance.” * * * In particular, it
relies on the statement of then-Senator Edmund Muskie that
prior to the issuance of any permit to dispose of spoil, the Administrator must
determine that the material to be disposed of will not adversely affect municipal
water supplies, shellfish beds, and fishery areas (including spawning and breeding
areas), wildlife or recreational areas in the specified site. Should the Administrator
so determine, no permit may issue.
118 Cong. Rec. at 33,699, reprinted in Legislative History at 177 (emphasis added).
“Assuming legislative history could override the plain, unambiguous directive” of section
404(c) and “putting to one side the fact that this was the statement of a single member of
Congress,” the quoted language is “not necessarily inconsistent with” EPA’s interpretation.
See Natural Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 706 F.3d 428, 437 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quotation marks
and brackets omitted); see also Mims v. Arrow Fin. Servs., LLC, 132 S. Ct. 740, 752 (2012)
(“[T]he views of a single legislator, even a bill’s sponsor, are not controlling.”). That EPA
should review the preliminary specifications pre-permit to determine whether discharges will
have the required “unacceptable adverse effect”—as EPA in fact did here—does not mean
it is foreclosed from doing so post-permit as well—as it also did here.6 “Thus, ‘this case
does not present the very rare situation where the legislative history of a statute is more
probative of congressional intent than the plain text.’ ” Va. Dep’t of Med. Assistance Servs.
v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 678 F.3d 918, 923 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting
Consumer Elecs. Ass’n v. FCC, 347 F.3d 291, 298 (D.C. Cir. 2003)) (brackets omitted).
For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court insofar as it held that EPA lacks
statutory authority under CWA section 404(c) to withdraw a disposal site specification postpermit. Because the district court did not address the merits of Mingo Logan’s APA
6

Similarly, post-permit withdrawal is not precluded by 33 C.F.R. § 323.6(b) (“The Corps will
not issue a permit where the regional administrator of EPA has notified the district engineer
and applicant in writing pursuant to 40 C.F.R. 231.3(a)(1) that he intends to issue a public
notice of a proposed determination to prohibit or withdraw the specification, or to deny,
restrict or withdraw the use for specification, of any defined area as a disposal site in
accordance with section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act.”).
303

challenge to the Final Determination and resolution of the issue is not clear on the present
record, we follow our usual practice and remand the issue to the district court to address in
the first instance. See Friends of Blackwater v. Salazar, 691 F.3d 428, 434 n.* (D.C. Cir.
2012) (citing Piersall v. Winter, 435 F.3d 319, 325 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).
Questions and comments
1.

Deference: The Corps and EPA both play a role in administering the Section 404
permit program. If EPA and the Corps disagree about the interpretation of Section
404(c), which agency’s interpretation is entitled to deference? Did the court have to
resolve that issue in this case?

2.

Consistent interpretation: Why is it significant that EPA interpreted its authority
under Section 404(c) consistently over thirty years? Is there evidence that Congress
was aware of that interpretation? Is that relevant?

3.

On a cert petition to the Supreme Court, Mingo Logan argued that the appellate
court’s decision would chill investment in development because it calls into question
the finality of Corps’ permits. However, is there another way that the government
could have prevented the Mingo Logan Coal Company from continuing to discharge
fill material besides EPA’s exercise of its 404(c) authority? How “final” are the Corps’
permits?

4.

A familiar statutory interpretation canon provides that when two statutes conflict, the
statute enacted last prevails. Another canon provides that repeals by implication are
disfavored. Yet another canon provides that when two statutes conflict, the specific
controls over the general. Were any of those canons relevant to Mingo Logan’s
argument that Section 404(p) demonstrated Congress’ intent that EPA should not
have the authority to veto a permit after the Corps has issued it?

5.

Projects vetoed: The project in the Mingo Logan case would have been the largest
surface coal mine in West Virginia. However, many of the cases where EPA has
exercised its 404(c) authority involve infrastructure development projects, such as
dams, water supply impoundments, flood control projects and landfills or recycling
plants. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Clean Water Act Section 404 (c)
“Veto Authority”. Consequently, when Mingo Logan file a petition for writ of certiorari
to the Supreme Court seeking review of the D.C. Circuit’s decision, amicus briefs
were filed by 27 States and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, as well as the National
Mining Association, National Association of Home Builders, American Petroleum
Institute, and the Chamber of Commerce. See SCOTUSblog, Mingo Logan Coal
Company v. Environmental Protection Agency. The Court denied the petition on
March 24, 2014.

304

6.

Remand: On remand, the District Court of the District of Columbia held that EPA’s
decision to exercise its 404(c) authority “was reasonable, supported by the record,
and based on considerations within the agency’s purview.” See Mingo Logan Coal
Company, Inc. v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Case No. 10-0541 (D.D.C.
2014).

7.

Pre-emptive vetoes: Although EPA’s regulations authorize the agency to prohibit
the specification of an area as a disposal site even before anyone has applied to the
Corps for a permit, EPA rarely exercises that authority. In 1987, when the agency
was vetoing Corps permits that would have authorized the developer to discharge
into two sites, the agency prohibited discharges into a third site nearby, even though
the developer had not yet sought a permit to discharge there. See 52 Fed. Reg.
38519, 38520 (Oct. 16, 1987). While that project involved a relatively small parcel of
land (60 acres of wetlands), in 2014, EPA began Section 404(c) proceedings to
address impacts from an open pit mining project in Alaska that would cover almost
70 square kilometers and could destroy between 1200 and 4900 acres of wetlands.
See Environmental Protection Agency, EPA 910-R-14-001ES, An Assessment of
the Potential Mining Impacts on Salmon Ecosystems of Bristol Bay, Alaska 11,13
(Jan. 2014). Several tribes asked EPA to begin the Section 404(c) proceedings
before developers applied to the Corps for a permit for the Pebble Mine project. See
Environmental Protection Agency, Why We Studied the Bristol Bay Watershed.
When the agency received those requests, it decided to conduct a scientific
assessment of the Bristol Bay watershed to understand how large scale mining
could impact water quality and the ecosystem, which is home to one of the largest
sockeye salmon populations in the world. Id. After completing the assessment, EPA
decided to begin the 404(c) process even though a developer had not yet sought a
Section 404 permit from the Corps. See Letter from Dennis J. McLerran, Regional
Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency to Thomas Collier, Joe Balash, and
Colonel Christopher D. Lestochi (Feb. 28, 2014). The developer immediately sued
EPA, but the Ninth Circuit rejected the challenge, concluding that EPA’s initiation of
the 404(c) process was not a “final agency action.” See Pebble Limited Partnership
v. EPA, 9th Cir., No. 3:14-cv-00097-HRH, ruling 5/28/15 (unpublished opinion).

Standards for the Veto

Section 404(c) empowers EPA to exercise its authority whenever the Administrator
determines that a discharge will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water
supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational areas. See 33 U.S.C. §
1344(c). The statute does not further define “unacceptable adverse effect”, but EPA’s
regulations define it as an “impact on an aquatic or wetland ecosystem which is likely to
result in significant degradation of municipal water supplies (including surface or ground
water) or significant loss of or damage to fisheries, shellfishing, or wildlife habitat or
recreation areas.” See 40 C.F.R. § 231.2(e). More importantly, perhaps, the regulations
provide that “In evaluating the unacceptability of such impacts, consideration should be
given to the relevant portions of the section 404(b)(1) guidelines.” Id.
Since neither the statute nor the regulations provide a clear substantive standard for EPA’s
exercise of authority, the agency frequently commences Section 404(c) proceedings when
it concludes that the Corps is planning to issue, or has issued, a permit in violation of the
404(b)(1) guidelines. For instance, in James City County v. U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, 955 F.2d 254 (4th Cir. 1992), EPA initially vetoed a Corps permit because the
agency determined that the Corps incorrectly determined that there were no practicable
alternatives for the proposed project. Similarly, in Bersani v. Robichaud, 850 F.2d 36 (2d
Cir. 1988), the Second Circuit upheld EPA’s veto of a mall development project based on
the agency’s determination that the Corps incorrectly applied the alternatives analysis.
Since many of the projects that EPA has vetoed have been public works projects,
developers and local governments have argued that EPA should weigh and balance the
“public interest” of a project against any environmental harms when determining whether a
discharge would have an unacceptable adverse effect. However, courts have generally
rejected that argument. As the Fourth Circuit wrote in James City County v. Environmental
Protection Agency, 12 F.3d 1330 (4th Cir. 1993), in response to an argument that EPA
should weigh the necessity of an enlarged water supply for the community against the
environmental harms of the project:
“Congress obviously intended the Corps ... in the initial permitting process to
consider the total range of factors bearing on the necessity or desirability of building
a dam in the Nation’s waters, including whether the project was in the public
interest. ... Ultimately, however, recognizing the EPA’s expertise and concentrated
concern with environmental matters, Congress gave the final decision whether to
permit a project to that agency. Its authority to veto to protect the environment is
practically unadorned. ... In our view, the EPA’s only function relating to the
quantities of available water is limited to assuring purity in whatever quantities the
state and local agencies provide. For those reasons, we think its veto based solely
on environmental harms was proper.”

306

Questions and comments
1.

Basis for decision: Although EPA frequently exercises its Section 404(c) authority
when it determines that the Corps has misapplied the 404(b)(1) guidelines, the
agency also exercises its authority by making a more general determination that a
discharge is likely to cause a significant degradation of water supplies or significant
loss of, or damage to, fisheries, shellfishing, or wildlife habitat or recreation areas.
When the agency exercises its authority in advance of a permit application, as in the
Pebble Mine case, it cannot rely on the 404(b)(1) guidelines, as there is no project
proposal to evaluate against the guidelines.

2.

Standard of Review: What standard of review will courts apply to EPA’s
determination that a discharge will have an unacceptable adverse effect on
municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational
areas? See James City County v. Environmental Protection Agency, 12 F.3d 1330
(4th Cir. 1993). To the extent that EPA’s decision is based on the 404(b)(1)
guidelines, does EPA owe any deference to the Corps’ interpretation of, or
application of, the guidelines? See in Bersani v. Robichaud, 850 F.2d 36 (2d Cir.
1988).

Drafting Exercise
The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, allows any person to request and obtain
agency records on any topic, although it exempts nine categories of records from the
disclosure requirement. Id. § 552(b). The statute requires agencies to respond to requests
within specific time periods and authorizes agencies to charge reasonable fees to find,
duplicate and review documents that will be disclosed. Id. § 552(a). The statute also
authorizes agencies to disclose the documents without charging fees “if the disclosure of the
information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the
commercial interest of the requester.” Id. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Federal agencies adopt their own
regulations to implement FOIA and EPA’s regulations are codified at 40 C.F.R. § 2.100, et.
seq. The agency also maintains a FOIA reference guide that outlines the process for making
a FOIA request at http://www.epa.gov/foia/guide.html
For this drafting exercise, you will be drafting a FOIA request to EPA, but DO NOT USE
EPA’S ONLINE FOIA REQUEST FORM. Instead, you should model your request on sample
letters like those provided by the National Freedom of Information Coalition, George
Washington University, or the Department of the Treasury. EPA’s regulations will identify the
appropriate person to whom your request should be directed.
For purposes of this drafting exercise, you are an attorney with Defenders of the Canadian
River, a non-profit environmental advocacy group. Several years ago, the Corps of Engineers
issued a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit to the Mammoth Quarry Company, authorizing
mining activities that impact wetlands adjacent to the Canadian River. Your organization
believes that the discharges authorized by the permit are having a much greater impact on
those wetlands than the Corps anticipated when it issued the permit. Recently, EPA has
been considering initiating Section 404(c) proceedings to “withdraw the specification” of the
site of Mammoth’s discharge as a disposal site. You have heard that sometime in the last two
months, Senator Letitia Fen, a supporter of the quarry, met with EPA to express her
opposition to Section 404(c) proceedings. You have also heard that representatives of the
Mammoth Quarry Company met with EPA, within the last month, to provide the agency with
studies that indicate that the discharge of dredged or fill material from the quarry is not
harming the wetlands adjacent to the Canadian River. After those meetings, EPA announced
that it had decided that it would not take any further action under Section 404(c) at this time.
You don't know whether Senator Fen provided EPA with any documents at her meeting with
the agency or whether the agency kept any minutes regarding the meetings with Senator Fen
or the Mammoth Quarry Company, but you would like to see any documents that the
Senator or the Quarry Company provided to EPA, any documents that EPA provided to
the Senator or the Quarry Company, any minutes of the meetings, and any
communications between Senator Fen and EPA or the Quarry Company and EPA
relating to those meetings. In order to obtain those records, you need to make a request to
EPA under the Freedom of Information Act.

308

A.
Prepare a FOIA request for the documents, minutes and communications described above.
In preparing your request, please be sure to direct the request to the appropriate contact
person. Assume that you would like the agency to waive any fees for locating or reproducing
these records and include, in your letter, a request for a waiver of those fees. Include any
information that is necessary to obtain the fee waiver.
B.
In two weeks, you are scheduled to meet with several other non-profit environmental groups
to develop an advocacy strategy regarding the Mammoth Quarry permit and you would like
to have the EPA records by that time. Is EPA required to provide you the records within that
time frame? If not, can you ask EPA to expedite your request and is it likely that they will
grant your request to expedite if the reason for the request is as described above?

Chapter 9
States’ Roles and State Programs
Although the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency jointly
administer the Clean Water Act Section 404 program, States play a vital role in the
protection of wetlands. States can protect wetlands by: (1) creating their own State laws,
regulations and programs to protect wetlands, which can be more stringent and regulate
more wetlands than the Section 404 program; (2) assuming authority from the Corps of
Engineers to administer the federal Section 404 permit program, or streamlining permitting
under that program through the implementation of a State programmatic general permit; (3)
“vetoing” or imposing conditions on Section 404 permits through the Clean Water Act
Section 401 certification process; and (4) preventing the issuance of a Section 404 permit
for activities that violate State plans under the Coastal Zone Management Act.

I.

State Programs

A.

Federal/State Relationship

The Clean Water Act, like most federal environmental laws, adopts a cooperative
federalism approach, recognizing “the primary responsibilities and rights of States to
prevent, reduce and eliminate pollution...” See 33 U.S.C. § 1251(b). The statute explicitly
provides that the Clean Water Act does not pre-empt State or local water pollution control
programs, and recognizes that States and local governments can establish programs that
310

are more restrictive and regulate more waters and activities than the federal program.
See 33 U.S.C. § 1370. Section 510 of the statute provides:
Except as expressly provided in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall
(1) preclude or deny the right of any State or political subdivision thereof or
interstate agency to adopt or enforce
(A) any standard or limitation respecting discharges of pollutants, or
(B) any requirement respecting control or abatement of pollution;
except that if an effluent limitation, or other limitation, effluent standard,
prohibition, pretreatment standard, or standard of performance is in effect
under this chapter, such State or political subdivision or interstate agency
may not adopt or enforce any effluent limitation, or other limitation, effluent
standard, prohibition, pretreatment standard, or standard of performance
which is less stringent than the effluent limitation, or other limitation, effluent
standard, prohibition, pretreatment standard, or standard of performance
under this chapter; or
(2) be construed as impairing or in any manner affecting any right or jurisdiction of
the States with respect to the waters (including boundary waters) of such States.
Id. Under this floor preemption approach, programs of states and local governments can
be more restrictive, but not less restrictive, than the federal program.
In theory, therefore, states can provide vital protection for wetlands by addressing waters
and activities that are not regulated under the Section 404 program, or by imposing
additional limits on activities that are regulated under that program. However, a recent
study prepared by the Environmental Law Institute found that over 2/3 of states have
enacted laws that could limit the authority of states to regulate waters that are not
regulated under the Clean Water Act. See Environmental Law Institute, State Constraints:
State-Imposed Limitations on the Authority of Agencies to Regulate Waters Beyond the
Scope of the Federal Clean Water Act (May 2013). Many of those laws were not targeted
specifically at wetlands regulation, but apply broadly to state environmental regulation or
state regulation of a range of activities. According to the ELI report, thirteen states have
adopted laws that require that state regulations must be “no more stringent than” federal
regulations. Id. at 1. Twenty-three other states have adopted laws that prohibit states from
adopting regulations that are more stringent than federal regulations unless certain
requirements are met. Id. at 13-14. In addition to those limitations, the report notes that
twenty-two states have adopted laws that could limit state protection of wetlands because
the laws require state officials to compensate landowners for reductions in property value
caused by regulation or require state officials to assess their actions for takings implications
311

or other impacts on private property rights. Id. at 24. The report suggests that those laws
could chill state regulation of activities in wetlands that are not regulated under federal law.
Id.
Although many states have laws that could limit the authority of the states to regulate
activities that are not regulated under the Clean Water Act, half of the states have adopted
laws and regulations that provide some protection to wetlands that are not regulated under
the Clean Water Act and many states have adopted laws that require permits for activities
that are not regulated under the Clean Water Act despite the limits identified in the ELI
report. In fact, the ELI report noted that 17 states that had enacted laws that could limit
state regulation of waters and activities that are not regulated under the Clean Water Act
nevertheless regulated those activities. Id. at 2. Those programs, and state programs that
provide additional protection to wetlands that are already regulated under the Clean Water
Act, are described in the next section.

Research Problems
State Laws: Using the tools that you learned in your legal research class regarding
researching state laws, see if you can answer the following questions. When answering the
questions, please provide citations to support your answers.
1. When will a government action constitute a “taking” under Texas law?
2. In Mississisppi, when a state action prohibits or severely limits the right of a landowner
to conduct forestry or agricultural activities on forest or agricultural land (but does not
result in a taking), the landowner may still sue for compensation in an inverse
condemnation action. What level of reduction in property value triggers that right under
Mississippi law? Is the landowner entitled to compensation if the government is acting
to prohibit a nuisance by the landowner?

3. Does Idaho law place any limits on the authority of state agencies to adopt rules to
protect wetlands and waters that are more stringent than the rules adopted by the
federal government? If so, please describe the general limits.

B.

A Survey of State Programs

While the Clean Water Act allows states and local governments to administer their own
programs to protect wetlands and water quality, it does not require them to do so.
Nevertheless, according to a report prepared by the Environmental Law Institute in 2008,
twenty three states have enacted laws and regulations to require state permits for dredge
and fill activities in wetlands and other waters in the state. See Environmental Law Institute,
State Wetland Protection: Status, Trends & Model Approaches 9 (March 2008) [hereinafter
“ELI State Wetland Protection Report”]. Eight of those states limit the permit requirement to
312

activities in coastal and tidal wetlands, while the other fifteen regulate activities in
freshwater wetlands as well as in coastal, tidal and shoreline areas. Id. at 10. In states with
their own wetlands permitting programs, a discharge may often require both a federal and
state wetlands permit. If the Corps and the state have not streamlined the permitting
process through a State Programmatic General Permit, see infra, the project developer will
need to obtain permits from both the Corps and the state. As noted in Chapter 6, if the
Corps completes its review of a section 404 permit and issues the permit before other
agencies (including the state) have completed their reviews, the Corps will normally
condition the permit on approval by the other agencies. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(d)(4).
In light of the fact that state programs can regulate waters that are outside of federal
jurisdiction, six states regulate “geographically isolated” wetlands, such as the wetlands at
issue in the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County case, although some of those
programs are not permitting programs. See ELI State Wetland Protection Report at 11.

Carolina, South Carolina,
and Washington

Indiana, North Carolina,
Ohio, Tennessee,
Washington, and
Wisconsin

Id. While some of the states with wetlands permitting programs have adopted dedicated
wetlands permitting programs, other states rely on a patchwork of laws, such as water
pollution laws, growth management laws, shoreline management laws, and other laws, to
regulate activities in wetlands. Id. at 11. In most states, permits are issued by a state
agency, but some states have created programs that authorize local agencies to administer
wetlands permit programs. Id.
Regardless of whether states have adopted state wetlands permitting programs, every
state has adopted a definition of “waters” (by legislation or regulation) that includes
wetlands, and forty-two states have adopted statutory or regulatory definitions for
“wetlands.” Id. at 15, 18.
State wetlands programs are often similar to the federal program in many respects. For
instance, most states delineate wetlands using the 1987 Corps delineation manual,
although eighteen states rely on other delineation criteria or guidelines, in addition to, or
instead of, the Corps manual. Id. at 19-20. Regarding mitigation, thirty six states have
adopted legislation or policies to authorize and regulate mitigation for impacts to wetlands
313

or other aquatic resources. Id. at 23. Twenty-two states specifically authorize or require
mitigation banking through legislation, regulations or guidance. Id. at 26. Eighteen states
specifically address “in lieu fee mitigation” through legislation, regulations or guidance. Id.
at 28. Although only fourteen states have adopted statewide goals regarding wetland
restoration, most of those states have adopted a “no net loss” goal, similar to the federal
goal, or a goal of restoring a specific amount of wetland acreage within a specific timeframe. Id. at 47.
State wetland programs are also similar to the federal program in that several agencies are
usually involved in wetland regulation, management or protection in each state. Id. at 32. In
twenty-six states, two resource or environmental agencies oversee wetland activities, with
one agency generally focusing on regulatory activities, while the other focuses on nonregulatory activities. Id. at 32. In eleven states, authority over wetlands is divided among
three or more agencies. Id. at 33. In twelve states, though, a single state agency
administers all of the wetland programs in the state. Id. at 32.
Not surprisingly, the scope of activities regulated, the resources dedicated to wetlands
regulation, protection and restoration, and the level of monitoring and enforcement of state
wetland protection laws vary greatly from state to state. Only sixteen states have monitoring
and/or assessment programs that focus on wetlands, and only eight states implement a
program to recruit community members as volunteer monitors for wetlands. Id. at 42, 44.
The level of wetland protection afforded by states is often constrained by the level of
funding available for wetland protection activities. Most states rely on federal grants and
general state appropriations to fund wetland programs, but more than half of the states rely,
in part, on fees, and fifteen states rely, in part, on dedicated state appropriations. Id. at 36.

State Assumption of the Section 404 Program and State Programmatic
General Permits

A.

Assumption of the 404 Permitting Program

In addition to preserving the authority
of states to administer their own state
wetland protection programs, the Clean
Water Act, like most federal
environmental laws, authorizes states
to take over and administer the federal
wetlands permitting program in lieu of
the Corps of Engineers.

assumption and N.J. program regs.
ASWM web page re: assumption and
Handbook for States/Tribes re: assumption

Pursuant to Section 404(g) of the
Clean Water Act, a state can assume
the authority to issue permits for the
315

discharge of dredged or fill material into waters regulated under the Clean Water Act other
than traditional navigable waters or waters seaward of the high water mark. See 33
U.S.C. § 1344(g). EPA’s regulations also authorize tribes to assume that authority within
their jurisdiction. See 40 C.F.R. § 233.2 (defining “state” to include “indian tribe”). In order to
assume authority to administer the Section 404 permitting program, a state must enact laws
and regulations to create a program that meets several requirements outlined in the statute
that are designed to ensure that the state has the same authority to administer the Section
404 permitting program as the Corps would have. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(h)(1). The
requirements of the state program must be at least as stringent as, and may be more
stringent than, the federal requirements. See 40 C.F.R. § 233.1(c)-(d). Although the Corps
administers the Section 404 permitting program, Congress gave EPA, rather than the
Corps. the authority to review applications by states to assume Section 404 permitting
authority. If EPA determines that the state program meets the requirements of the statute,
the agency will approve the program and the state will assume authority to issue Section
404 permits in lieu of the Corps. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(h)(2). The Corps will, however,
continue to have authority to issue permits for discharges into traditional navigable waters
and waters seaward of the high water mark. In addition, to the extent that the state program
is more stringent than the federal program, those more stringent provisions can only be
enforced by the state and are not subject to federal oversight and enforcement. See 40
C.F.R. § 233.1(c).
The rest of the state program is, however, subject to federal oversight. After EPA approves
a state’s request to assume Section 404 permitting authority, the state must still provide
EPA notice and an opportunity to comment on individual and general permits that the state
reviews or prepares. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(j). EPA can, however, waive its authority to
review categories of discharges in the state, by adopting regulations to waive the authority.
Id. § 1344(k)-(l). If EPA doesn’t waive its authority to review permits issued by the state,
EPA solicits comments from the Corps, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National
Marine Fisheries Service when determining whether to submit comments to the state and
when framing comments for the permit. See 40 C.F.R. § 233.50(b). If EPA objects to a
permit that the state plans to issue, the state cannot issue the permit unless EPA withdraws
its objection. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(j). If the state does not deny the permit or revise it to
address EPA’s objections, the state loses the authority to issue that permit and the Corps
processes that permit application. Id.
While a State is administering the Section 404 permitting program, EPA also retains the
authority to bring enforcement actions, just as it would if the Corps were administering the
program. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(n). Finally, if EPA determines that a state that has
assumed authority to issue Section 404 permits is not administering the program in
accordance with federal standards, the agency can, after notice and a hearing, withdraw
the state’s authority to administer the program. Id. § 1344(i).
Although the Clean Water Act authorizes states to assume Section 404 permitting authority
316

in lieu of the Corps, only two states have done so. Michigan assumed authority for the
program in 1984, see 40 C.F.R. § 233.70, and New Jersey assumed authority for the
program in 1994. See 40 C.F.R. § 233.71.
B.

State Programmatic General Permits

States that do not assume Section 404
Resources
permitting authority from the Corps can still
ASWM Website re: SPGPs
play a greater role in the administration of
the federal program and streamline
permitting for developers in the state through
a State Programmatic General Permit. As noted in Chapter 6, supra, Section 404(e)
authorizes the Corps of Engineers to issue general permits “on a state, regional or
nationwide basis for any category of activities involving discharges of dredged or fill
material if the Secretary determines that the activities in such category are similar in nature,
will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately, and will
have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment.” See 33 U.S.C. §
1344(e).
Pursuant to that authority, the Corps has issued programmatic general permits in several
states that provide that persons who obtain a permit under the state wetlands permitting
program do not have to apply for an individual Section 404 permit from the Corps as long
as they comply with the terms of the programmatic general permit. See, e.g. Department of
the Army Programmatic General Permit, State of Maryland - MDSPGP-4 (Oct. 1, 2011).
The general permit only applies to specific categories of activities in the state (i.e.,
discharges in a specific region, discharges that have impacts below a specific threshold,
discharges associated with specific types of activities) and the Corps issues the permit
pursuant to the normal general permitting procedures described in Chapter 6 after the
Corps determines that the activities in the permit are similar in nature and will cause only
minimal adverse effect on the environment. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(e). The programmatic
general permit, therefore, streamlines the permitting process in those states for persons
engaged in the activities authorized by the permit. Like other general permits,
programmatic general permits are issued for a five year term, but can be revoked if the
Corps determines, after opportunity for a public hearing, that the activities authorized by the
permit have an adverse effect on the environment or are more appropriately authorized by
individual permits. Id.
When the Corps issues a programmatic general permit, the permit will include conditions
that specify whether, and to what extent, the Corps, EPA and other federal agencies will
review or comment on the use of the general permit by a discharger. See, e.g. MDSPGP-4,
supra at 6-9. For activities that have very little impact, the permit may provide very limited
federal review. Id. The states for which the Corps has issued programmatic general permits
are listed below.

permitting programs? What are the benefits and disadvantages of taking over the
federal program? See Association of State Wetland Managers, Clean Water Act

Research Problems
State PGPs: State PGPs can be found on the Corps’ websites for the Division in which a
State is located or on the website of the State agency that regulates water quality. Please
answer the following questions regarding the PGPs of Louisiana and North Carolina.
1. Does the Louisiana Programmatic General Permit apply to the discharge of dredged or fill
material into waters outside of the Louisiana Coastal Zone? Would minor road crossings that
cause the loss of less than .5 acres of special aquatic sites be regulated as Category I or
Category II activities under that permit? If a person submits a complete application to
request authorization to undertake a Category I activity under the Programmatic General
Permit, and has not received an authorization to proceed with the activity from the Corps,
must the person wait for authorization or can they proceed with their activity?
2. What activities are authorized by the North Carolina Programmatic General Permit? Does
the permit impose any limits on mechanized land-clearing activities in waters or wetlands?

III.

401 Certification

While states can adopt their own state wetlands permitting programs, assume the federal
permitting program and streamline regulation through state programmatic general permits,
almost half of the states do not take those approaches and rely solely on the Clean Water
Act Section 401 certification process to regulate wetlands in their state. According to a
319

2008 ELI report, 22 states do not have any wetlands regulatory program and rely solely on
the 401 certification process to regulate wetlands. See ELI State Wetland Protection Report
at 13. An additional 15 states regulate coastal wetlands, isolated wetlands, or other
subcategories of wetlands through a state permitting program, but rely on section 401
certification as the primary form of regulation for other wetlands in the state. Id. Thus,
section 401 certification is probably the most important tool in the Clean Water Act for state
regulation of wetlands.
Section 401 of the Clean Water Act provides:
Any applicant for a Federal license or permit to conduct any activity ...which may
result in any discharge into the navigable waters, shall provide the licensing or
permitting agency a certification from the State in which the discharge originates or
will originate ... that any such discharge will comply with [state water quality
standards and several other requirements of the Clean Water Act] ... No license or
permit shall be granted until the certification required by this section has been
obtained or has been waived ... No license or permit shall be granted if certification
has been denied by the State ….
33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1). In light of that requirement, whenever a person applies to the
Corps for a Section 404 permit, or whenever a person applies for any Federal license or
permit that results in a discharge into the navigable waters (including jurisdictional
wetlands), they must provide the permitting or licensing agency with a certification from the
State that the activity to be authorized by the permit complies with state water quality
standards and other requirements of the Clean Water Act. The state can (1) certify that the
discharge meets the state standards and requirements; (2) deny certification; or (3)
attach comments or conditions to any permit that the Corps issues to ensure that the
discharge complies with state water quality standards and “appropriate requirement[s] of
state law”. Id. § 1341(d). The Corps (or other permitting or licensing agency) cannot issue
the permit unless the State certifies that the activity complies with the state standards or
waives its right to certify. Id. § 1341(a). If a state fails or refuses to act on a request for 401
certification within 60 days after receiving the request, the state waives its right to veto or
condition the permit. See 33 C.F.R. § 325.2(b)(1)(ii). Any conditions that the state attaches
to a 401 certification become conditions of the federal permit or license. See 33 U.S.C. §
1341(d).
In deciding whether to certify a discharge, deny certification or include conditions in the
permit for the discharge, states can consider not only the immediate effects of the
discharge on water quality in the state, but the longer term effects of the activity authorized
by the discharge on water quality. See 40 C.F.R. § 121.2(a)(3)-(4); 33 C.F.R. § 320.3(a);
PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Washington Department of Environmental Quality, 511
U.S. 700 (1994).

320

As a result, even when a state does not have a state wetlands permitting program, they can
exert some control over discharges into wetlands in their state, as long as the discharges
require a Section 404 permit (or other federal permit or license), and as long as the state’s
water quality standards or “other appropriate requirements of state law” provide protection
for wetlands. The 2008 ELI report found that states rarely deny or waive 401 certification,
although they may frequently include conditions in their certifications. See ELI State
Wetland Protection Report at 15. The number of 401 certifications issued each year by
states varies greatly, from Connecticut, issuing fewer than 20 certifications per year, to
California, issuing more than 1000 certifications per year. Id. States that have their own
state wetland permitting and regulatory programs generally rely less frequently on Section
401 certification to protect wetlands.
As noted above, in determining whether to grant, deny or condition 401 certification for a
discharge into wetlands, states focus on whether the discharge violates state water quality
standards and other appropriate requirements of state law. The Clean Water Act requires
states to establish water quality standards, which are reviewed and approved by EPA, for
the waters in the state that are regulated under the Act. See 33 U.S.C. § 1313. Water
quality standards generally include use designations for waters in the state and water
quality criteria to protect the various uses of water. See 40 C.F.R. § 131.3(i). The
standards are set at levels to “protect the public health or welfare, enhance the quality of
water and serve the purposes of the Act.” Id.
Regarding use designations, states can establish a range of acceptable uses for waters in
the state, including recreation, drinking water supplies, fishing, and others. See 40 C.F.R. §
131.10. Water quality criteria are then established for each use, or for all waters in the
state, to ensure that the waters can be used for the designated uses. Id. § 131.11. The
criteria may be specific numerical limits on pollutant levels in a body of water or they may
be narrative criteria that don’t include specific numerical limits. Id. States assign use
designations to each body of water in the state that is regulated under the Clean Water Act
(and can assign different use designations for different segments of the water), and the
water quality criteria that apply to the assigned use, or to all waters in the state, set the
pollution limits for that body of water (or segment of the body of water). See 40 C.F.R. §
131.10. Georgia’s water quality standards are linked here as an example.
As noted above, every state has adopted a definition of “waters’ that includes wetlands.
However, most states have not adopted water quality standards that are specifically
designed to provide protection to wetlands (i.e., by designating uses for wetlands or
developing specific criteria for wetlands). According to the Environmental Law Institute’s
2008 50 state survey, only 13 states have adopted water quality standards that are
specifically targeted at protecting wetlands. See ELI State Wetland Protection Report at 37.
That doesn’t mean that water quality standards in the other states might not provide
protection to wetlands and might not be used as the basis for denying or conditioning 401
certification for a discharge that affects wetlands. Indeed, other water quality standards
321

may provide incidental protection to wetlands, even though they were not adopted with that
specific goal in mind. For instance, water quality standards that are not wetland-specific
often include limits to address flood control, sediment trapping, habitat protection, pollution
control, shoreline protection, and maintenance of stream flow. Id. at 38.
While a variety of water quality standards may provide incidental protection to wetlands,
wetland-specific water quality standards can be a more effective way to provide wetland
protection and to serve as a basis for denial or conditioning of 401 certification. EPA
published guidance in 1990 to assist states in developing water quality standards
specifically targeted to protect wetlands. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA
440/S-90-011, Water Quality Standards for Wetlands: National Guidance (July 1990).
Frequently, whether a state adopts wetland-specific water quality standards depends on
the broader range of tools that the state uses to protect wetlands. Most of the states that
have adopted wetland-specific water quality standards do not have a permitting program
that applies to all wetlands in the state and rely heavily on the Section 401 certification
process to regulate wetlands. Id. at 37. Similarly, many of the 37 states that have not
adopted wetland-specific water quality standards do not rely primarily on the 401
certification process to protect wetlands. Id at 39.
While the Section 401 certification process primarily protects the interests of the state
where a discharge of dredged or fill material will occur, the statute also authorizes EPA to
notify other states about potentially permitted discharges if the agency determines that the
discharge may affect the water quality in the other states. See 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(2).
Based on recommendations from the state and EPA, the federal permitting agency may
then include conditions in the federal license or permit necessary to meet water quality
standards in the other states or may deny the permit if it is not possible to condition the
permit to meet those standards. Id.
Questions and Comments
1.

Water Quality Standards: In addition to designated uses and water quality criteria,
state water quality standards usually include provisions to ensure compliance with a
state “anti-degradation policy.” The anti-degradation policy is designed to maintain
existing water uses and a level of water quality necessary to protect and maintain
existing water uses. See 40 C.F.R. § 131.12. In PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v.
Washington Department of Environmental Quality, 511 U.S. 700 (1994), the
Supreme Court held that a state can deny 401 certification or condition it on
compliance with any one of the three components of water quality standards - uses,
criteria, or standards necessary to comply with an anti-degradation policy.

322

2.

Appropriate requirements of state law: Section 401 authorizes states to deny or
condition permits on compliance with “appropriate requirements of state law.” While
the Supreme Court, in the PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County case, held that water
quality standards were “appropriate requirements of state law”, the Court refused to
“speculate on what additional state laws, if any, might be incorporated” by that
language.

IV.

Coastal Zone Management Act Certification

In addition to the tools outlined above, some states can also utilize the Coastal Zone
Management Act’s certification process to protect wetlands in the state. Under the Act,
coastal states (states that border the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans, the Gulf of
Mexico, the Long Island Sound, or one or more of the Great Lakes) prepare coastal zone
management plans, which are reviewed and approved by the Secretary of Commerce. See
16 U.S.C. § 1455. Approved programs are eligible for federal funding to assist in
implementation of the programs. Id. Twenty-nine states have approved coastal zone
management programs. See U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration, State Coastal Management Program Manager and Federal
Consistency Contacts. The states with approved programs are: Alabama, California,
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. Id.
To ensure consistency with the state programs, any person who applies for a federal permit
or license to conduct an activity that will affect land or water use or natural resources of the
coastal zone must provide, as part of the permit or license application, “a certification that
the proposed activity complies with the enforceable policies of the state’s approved
program and that such activity will be conducted in a manner consistent with the program.”
See 16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A). Consequently, if a proposed discharge of dredged or fill
material will affect the land, water or resources of the coastal zone in a state with an
approved coastal zone management program, the applicant for a section 404 permit will
need to submit a certification from the state that the discharge complies with, and is
consistent with, the state’s coastal zone management program. If the applicant does not
submit the certification, the Corps will not issue the Section 404 permit. See 33 C.F.R. §
325.2(b)(2)(ii). Pursuant to this authority, therefore, a state could refuse to certify a
discharge that would harm wetlands in the coastal zone if the discharge was not consistent
with the state’s program or did not comply with the program.

324

Hypothetical
The State of Colorado does not have any laws that require persons to obtain permits from the State to
undertake activities that impact wetlands in the State. Assume, for purposes of this question, that Colorado
does not issue Clean Water Act Section 402 permits and that those permits are issued by EPA. The City of
Alamosa, Colorado is upgrading its sewage treatment plant and has applied to EPA to amend its permit
under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act to discharge treated wastewater into the Rio Grande River. The
State of Colorado is concerned that high levels of nutrients and chlorine discharged from the sewage
treatment plant might harm the freshwater wetlands that are located downstream of the treatment plant,
adjacent to the Rio Grande River. Will the city be required to obtain a permit or other approval from the
State of Colorado as part of the Section 402 permit process? Is there any action that Colorado can take to
limit the amount of nutrients or chlorine that the plant will be allowed to discharge under its Section 402
permit? Could the State rely on a local ordinance of the City of Alamosa that limits the amount of nutrients
that are discharged into the Rio Grande River?
The Rio Grande River flows south from Colorado into New Mexico. If the state of New Mexico is also
concerned about the levels of nutrients and chlorine that will be discharged by the treatment plant, is there
any action that it can take to limit the amount of nutrients or chlorine that the plant will be allowed to
discharge under its Section 402 permit? With what success? It is not necessary to provide specific state
statutory provisions to answer these questions.

Chapter 10
Administrative Appeals, Judicial Review
and Enforcement
When the Corps of Engineers or EPA takes an action under the Clean Water Act, or fails to
take an action, landowners, interest groups, states, and any number of other persons may
seek to challenge the agencies’ action or inaction. Part I of this chapter examines the
administrative and judicial avenues for appealing those decisions.
However, the Corps and EPA are not simply defendants in administrative and judicial
proceedings. Whenever a person fails to comply with the permitting requirements or other
requirements of the Clean Water Act, the agencies can take a variety of administrative or
judicial enforcement actions. Part II of this chapter examines those enforcement options.
I.

Administrative Appeals and Judicial Review

decisions

District of the Corps)

Flow chart of appeal process for permit
decisions and for approved jurisdictional
determinations
RGL 06-01 - Timeliness of a request for
appeal

The Clean Water Act does not explicitly
provide for an administrative process to
review the Corps’ actions in administering
the Section 404 permit program and there
was no administrative appeal process for
the program for the first several decades of
its existence. To the extent that persons
wanted to challenge a Corps decision to
issue or deny a permit or to take some
other action, they could only challenge
those actions in court, if at all. However, in
1999 and 2000, the Corps of Engineers adopted regulations that created an administrative
appeal program for final permit decisions, see 64 Fed. Reg. 11,708 (March 9, 1999) and
final jurisdictional determinations. See 65 Fed. Reg. 16,486 (March 28, 2000). One of the
advantages of the program for the Corps and for landowners is that it should lead to more
uniform and consistent decision-making. As noted in Chapters 4 and 5, absent an appeal,
final permit decisions and final jurisdictional determinations are made at the District level,
326

by 43 different District Engineers. The appeal process adopted by the Corps provides for
review at the Division level. Since there are only 9 Divisions, as opposed to 43 Districts, the
decision-making should be more uniform and consistent. (Note: Although there are 9
Divisions, the Transatlantic Division does not issue Section 404 permits, since the Division
only encompasses the Middle East and Asia).
Since administrative processes are generally quicker and less expensive than judicial
processes, the administrative appeal process should also save the Corps and challengers
time and money by keeping challenges out of court. It should also provide the Corps with
an additional opportunity to develop a record that can withstand judicial challenge if the
agency’s decision is ultimately contested in court.

appeal: (1) an approved jurisdictional
determination; (2) a written denial of an
individual permit application with prejudice
(a permit denial); and (3) an individual permit or letter of permission that the applicant has
declined to accept because he has objections to the terms and conditions of the permit (a
declined permit). See 33 C.F.R. § 331.2.
Consequently, a preliminary jurisdictional determination, in which the Corps indicates that
there may be jurisdictional waters on a parcel of property or which indicates the
approximate location of jurisdictional waters on a parcel of property, cannot be appealed
administratively, while an approved jurisdictional determination can be appealed
administratively. Id. As noted in Chapter 4, supra, an approved jurisdictional determination
is an official determination by the Corps that there are, or are not, jurisdictional waters on a
parcel of property, and outlining the limits of the waters. See 33 C.F.R. § 331.2.
Regarding permit decisions, if the Corps denies an individual permit request without
prejudice, for instance, because a state denied Section 401 certification or refused to
certify that the discharge was consistent with a coastal zone management plan, the Corps’
permit denial cannot be administratively appealed. Id. The Corps’ denial of an individual
permit request can only be challenged administratively when the Corps denies the permit
with prejudice. Further, if the Corps determines that a general permit does not authorize
a particular activity, that decision cannot be appealed administratively. The administrative
appeal process is limited to individual permit decisions. Id.
In addition to limiting the actions that can be challenged administratively, the regulations
327

limit who can raise those challenges. Only “affected parties”, defined as permit applicants,
landowners or other persons with a substantial and identifiable legal interest in the property
at issue, can bring administrative challenges. Id. Neighbors, competitors, interest groups,
state or local governments, and other interested parties can only challenge actions of the
Corps judicially, if at all.
2.

Review Process

At the time that the Corps makes a decision at the District level that can be appealed under
its regulations, the agency provides a notice to the person to whom the decision is directed
that the decision can be appealed, a fact sheet describing the appeal process, and a form
that the person can use to request an appeal of the decision. See 33 C.F.R. § 331.4. If the
permit applicant or landowner wishes to appeal, they must file a request for appeal, stating
the reasons for the appeal, within sixty days of the notice from the Corps. Id. § 331.6.
While EPA’s administrative appeal process and the administrative appeal processes of
many agencies provide for review and decision-making by a centralized body, usually at
the headquarters level, the Corps’ regulations provide for review and ultimate decisionmaking on appeals at the Division level. Id. § 331.9. Thus, when a permit applicant or
landowner appeals a decision of a Corps District, a Review Officer for the Division will
oversee the appeal. Id. § 331.3. The regulations do not require that the Corps provide
public notice of the appeal and do not provide for a formal hearing. Instead, the regulations
authorize an informal meeting or conference call for appeals of jurisdictional determinations
and an informal conference for appeals of permit decisions. Id. § 331.7.
Ultimately, the Division Engineer has limited authority to overturn the District’s decisions.
The Division Engineer can only overturn the District Engineer’s factual findings if they are
not supported by substantial evidence on the administrative record prepared by the
District. Id. § 331.9. In addition, the Division Engineer can only overturn other portions of
the decision below if they are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, ..., or plainly
contrary to a requirement of law, regulation, an Executive Order, or officially promulgated
Corps policy guidance.” Id. § 331.9(b). The Division Engineer must issue a final decision in
writing, id., and should normally make the decision within 90 days after the permit applicant
or landowner begins the appeal process. Id. § 331.8.
The Corps’ regulations provide that decisions on appeals are “only applicable to the instant
appeal and [have] no other precedential effect.” Id. § 331.7(g). Nevertheless, each of the
Divisions that is involved in Section 404 permitting makes those decisions available on a
website for the Division. The following table provides links for the Divisions.

Questions and Comments
1.

Preliminary jurisdictional determinations of the Corps cannot be administratively
appealed. Neither can permit denials without prejudice, cease and desist orders
issued by the Corps, delays in processing of Corps permits, and many other Corps
actions. Why do you think that the Corps did not provide for administrative appeals
of a broader range of actions? Similarly, why did the Corps establish the appeals
process for permit decisions and jurisdictional determinations in separate
rulemakings? See 65 Fed. Reg. 16,486 (March 28, 2000); 64 Fed. Reg. 11,708
(March 9, 1999).

2.

Third parties: Only permit applicants and landowners can file administrative
appeals of Corps actions. While federal rules for intervention may provide
opportunities for third parties to become involved in judicial challenges to Corps
actions, those rules do not apply to administrative proceedings. Instead, the
Corps regulations do not provide any procedure for third parties to seek to be
involved in the appeal process and only provide limited authority for the Review
Officer to invite appropriate third parties to participate informally in the proceedings.
See 33 C.F.R. § 331.7(e)(3).

3.

Volume: When the Corps issued the initial notice of proposed rulemaking for the
administrative appeals program, it anticipated that the program would consume
significant resources because there would be a high volume of appeals. See 60
Fed. Reg. 37,280, 37,283 (July 19, 1995). However, fewer than 1% of individual
permit and jurisdictional determinations are appealed. See Kim D. Connolly, The
Corps Administrative Appeal Process, in Wetlands Law and Policy: Understanding
Section 404 361 (American Bar Association, Section on Environment, Energy and
Resources 2005).

4.

Issue Exhaustion: To the extent that the Corps’ regulations require persons to
challenge the agency’s decisions administratively before challenging the decisions
in court, see 33 C.F.R. § 331.12, general administrative law principles require
challengers to alert the agency to their specific positions and contentions in the
administrative appeal “in order to allow the agency to give the issue meaningful
consideration” or face dismissal of those challenges in court for failure to exhaust
administrative remedies. See, e.g., Forest Guardians v. United States Forest
Service, 641 F.3d 423 (10th Cir. 2011).

329

Hypotheticals
In which of the following cases could the challenger pursue an administrative appeal?
1. Juan Lagares would like to challenge the preliminary jurisdictional determination that the
Corps issued because the Corps concluded that the wetlands on his property may be “waters
of the United States.”
2. Phyllis Jones would like to challenge the approved jurisdictional determination that the Corps
issued to her neighbor, Juan Lagares, because the Corps ultimately concluded that the
wetlands on his property were not “waters of the United States.”
3. Rollie Wright planned to build a dock on his property and indicated to the Corps that he
planned to construct the dock in accordance with a regional general permit issued by the local
Corps district. The local Corps district informed Wright that the construction was not authorized
by the general permit, and he would like to challenge that decision.
4. Rollie Wright applied to the Corps for an individual Section 404 permit to authorize
construction of his dock, but the State refused to issue a Section 401 certification. Accordingly,
the Corps denied Wright’s permit application without prejudice. Wright would like to challenge
that decision.
5. The Shea Development Corporation applied to the Corps for an individual Section 404
permit to authorize construction of a golf course. The Corps issued the permit with a condition
that Shea restore or enhance 50 acres of wetlands in the watershed in which the development
will take place or purchase mitigation credits to restore or enhance 50 acres of wetlands in that
watershed. Shea would like to challenge the mitigation condition in the permit.

Research Problems
Although the Corps’ administrative appeal decisions are not available on Westlaw or Lexis, the
Corps’ Divisions post the decisions on their websites, as noted above. Please answer the
following questions based on the information provided on the agency’s websites.
1. Your client was denied a Section 404 permit for development in Cherry Hill, New Jersey and
you are considering an administrative appeal. Between 2001 and 2013, how frequently did the
Corps Division that will hear your appeal find that an appeal of a permit denial or proffered permit
had merit?
2. Your client wants to challenge an approved jurisdictional determination for property that she
owns in Galveston, Texas, as she believes that the ponds on her property are not “waters of the
United States.” You have heard that the Division that would hear your appeal overturned a
jurisdictional determination from your district with similar facts in 2012. Although the Corps’
administrative appeal decisions are not precedential, you are interested in examining that
decision. Please find that decision and identify the reasons that the Division concluded that the
landowner’s appeal had merit.
3. For decisions appealed in 2011, in the South Atlantic Division, from which District did most of
the meritorious appeals to permitting decisions originate? From which district did most of the
meritorious appeals to jurisdictional determinations originate? Between 2000 and 2012, when
permit applicants challenged a permit denial to the Division, how frequently did the challenge
ultimately result in a permit issuance by the Corps District?

B.

Judicial Review

1.

Reviewable Actions

Although the Clean Water Act includes a judicial review provision that authorizes review
of many EPA actions, the provision does not apply to any of EPA’s actions regarding the
Section 404 program, and it does not apply to any actions of the Corps of Engineers. See
33 U.S.C. § 1369. The Act also includes a citizen suit provision, discussed later, that
authorizes suits against EPA if the agency fails to perform a non-discretionary duty. See 33
U.S.C. § 1365. However, most of the lawsuits that might be brought against EPA regarding
wetlands, such as a challenge to regulations implementing Section 404, approval or denial
of state program assumption, exercise of a Section 404 veto, or an enforcement order,
involve the exercise of discretion by the agency, rather than a failure to perform a nondiscretionary duty. The citizen suit provision is even less helpful with regard to
challenging actions of the Corps, as the statute only explicitly authorizes suits against “the
Administrator” (EPA), and not the Corps. While the Corps takes some actions regarding
wetlands pursuant to its Rivers and Harbors Act authority, that statute also does not have a
provision authorizing judicial review of the Corps’ actions. The only provision in either
statute that expressly authorizes judicial review of an action by EPA or the Corps is a
331

provision, discussed later, that authorizes review of administrative penalties imposed by
EPA. See 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(8).
Consequently, persons seeking judicial review of actions of the Corps or EPA regarding
wetlands must rely on the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The APA provides that a
“final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court ..[is] subject to
judicial review”, see 5 U.S.C. § 704, and “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of
agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a
relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.” See 5 U.S.C. § 702. Significantly, the
APA defines “agency action” to include a “failure to act.” See 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). The APA
waives the government’s sovereign immunity to the extent that the challenger is seeking
declaratory or injunctive relief. See 5 U.S.C. § 702. While the APA does not grant
jurisdiction to any court to hear the challenges that it makes reviewable, litigants can
usually rely on 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (the general federal question jurisdiction statute) or other
general jurisdictional statutes to establish jurisdiction for their lawsuit. The general federal
question jurisdiction statute provides “[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all
civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.” Id.
Thus, persons who can demonstrate standing to sue, as discussed below, will generally be
able to challenge actions of EPA or the Corps regarding wetlands in federal district court as
long as the action is a final agency action. In general, the Supreme Court has held that for
an action to be final, it “must mark the ‘consummation’ of the agency’s decisionmaking
process” (not be of a tentative or interlocutory nature) and “must be one by which ‘rights or
obligations have been determined’ or from which ‘legal consequences will flow.” See
Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154,178 (1997).
One might assume that a permit applicant could challenge the Corps’ denial of a Section
404 permit with prejudice or any unwanted conditions included in a Section 404
permit issued by the Corps as a final agency action under the APA, but the Corps’
administrative appeals regulations require permit applicants to appeal those decisions
administratively before suing in court. See 33 C.F.R. § 331.12. If the Corps affirms the
denial of the permit or affirms the inclusion of the unwanted conditions when it makes a
decision on the administrative appeal, the permit applicant can challenge those decisions in
court at that time.
Persons other than the permit applicant who want to challenge the Corps’ decision to issue
a permit, deny a permit, or include conditions in the permit have no obligation to pursue any
administrative appeal process before suing in court because they have no right to appeal in
the administrative process. However, if they challenge the Corps’ decision to issue or deny
a permit and the permit applicant is pursuing, or could still pursue, an administrative
appeal, a court will likely conclude that the challenger cannot bring their lawsuit until the
administrative process has concluded, because the agency’s decision is not “the
‘consummation’ of the agency’s decision-making process” and is not a final agency action.
332

See 33 C.F.R. § 331.10. (identifying the final decision of the Corps in the event of an
administrative appeal).
For jurisdictional determinations, a preliminary jurisdictional determination (a decision
that there may be waters of the United States on a parcel of land) is likely not subject to
judicial review because it is tentative and subject to further review and modification within
the agency. See 33 C.F.R. § 331.2. An approved jurisdictional determination (a decision
that waters of the United States exist or do not exist on a parcel of land and outlining the
extent of the jurisdictional waters) can be appealed administratively, but EPA and the Corps
argue that an approved jurisdictional determination that confirms the presence of waters of
the United States on property is not a final agency action that can be challenged in court.
Instead, they argue that persons can only challenge that decision in court after they apply
for a permit and the Corps or EPA make a decision on the permit. In Fairbanks North Star
Borough v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 543 F.3d 586 (9th Cir. 2008), the Ninth Circuit
concluded that an approved jurisdictional determination was not a final agency action
because it was not an action from which legal consequences flowed. It is not yet clear
whether the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, 566
U.S. __(2012), will change that, but in Belle Corp., L.L.C. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
No. 13-30262 (5th Cir. July 30, 2014), a case decided after Sackett, the Fifth Circuit applied
the Sackett analysis and determined that an approved jurisdictional determination was not
a final agency action because it was not “an action by which rights of obligations have been
determined or from which legal consequences flow.” Belle’s successor sought review of the
decision in the Supreme Court, but the Court denied certiorari in Kent Recycling Services
LLC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S., No. 14-493, cert. denied, 3/23/15. However, in
April, 2015, the Eighth Circuit held that an approved jurisdictional determination by the
Corps is a final agency action that can be challenged in court. See Hawkes Co., Inc. v.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 782 F.3d 994 (8th Cir. 2015). Since the Hawkes decision
created a circuit split, Kent Recycling asked the Supreme Court to rehear its cert. petition,
see Kent Recycling Services LLC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S., No. 14-493,
rehearing pet. filed, 4/16/15 and the United States sought cert. on the Hawkes case. See
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., Inc., No. 15-290, cert. pet. Filed, 9/8/2015.
While the Corps and EPA assert that an approved jurisdictional determination that
confirms the presence of waters of the United States on property cannot be challenged
in court at the time of the determination, they do not resist judicial review of an approved
jurisdictional determination that finds that there are no waters of the United States
present on a parcel of land. In those cases, the government’s determination is not tentative
and, in essence, authorizes the landowner to move ahead with development projects
without seeking a Section 404 permit. The landowner is unlikely to challenge that decision,
but neighbors, competitors, interest groups and other third parties may challenge the
decision. See Golden Gate Audubon Society v. United States Army Corps of Engineers,
717 F. Supp. 1417 (N.D. Cal. 1988).

333

Regarding other permitting decisions, when the Corps or EPA determines that an activity
doesn’t qualify for a general permit or a permit exemption, the agencies argue that the
developer must apply for an individual permit and can only challenge the general permit or
exemption determination judicially as part of a challenge to the agencies’ ultimate decision
on the permit application. In Avella v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 916 F.2d 721 (11th
Cir. 1990), the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a district court’s finding that the Corps’
determination that a developer’s activity was not authorized by a nationwide permit was not
a final agency action because the agency’s decision did not have a binding legal effect on
the developer. If, however, the government determines that an activity qualifies for a
general permit or a permit exemption, the decision can generally be challenged in court at
that time, since the government’s decisionmaking process is complete and has a similar
binding legal effect as the issuance of an individual permit. See Orleans Audubon Society
v. Lee, 742 F.2d 901 (5th Cir. 1984).
There are many actions that EPA and the Corps take in administering Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act other than issuing or denying permits and making jurisdictional
determinations. However, for all of those other actions, the road to the courthouse door is
the same as for the permitting and jurisdictional decisions. The agencies’ actions are
reviewable if they are final agency actions. Although the cases are fact-sensitive, this
means that regulations adopted by the Corps or EPA will frequently be subject to APA
challenge as final agency actions, since they are legally binding and often have direct legal
effect on challengers, while guidance documents and policy statements will not be subject
to review, since they are not legally binding and don’t have a direct legal effect. EPA’s
exercise of its Section 404(c) authority represents the consummation of the agency’s
procedures and has the same legal effect on a landowner as the denial of a Section 404
permit, so it will generally be judicially reviewable.
In the enforcement context, for many years, EPA and the Corps argued that cease and
desist orders and administrative enforcement orders issued by the agencies could not be
challenged because they were not final agency action and because the statute implicitly
precluded review of the orders. Several courts agreed with the agencies until the Supreme
Court issued the following decision.

EPA Compliance Order at issue
Administrative Record
EPA Guidance Post-Sackett
EPA News Release re: administrative order
Local media article re: the Sackett case

We consider whether Michael and Chantell Sackett may bring a civil action under the
Administrative Procedure Act * * * to challenge the issuance by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) of an administrative compliance order under § 309 of the Clean
Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1319. The order asserts that the Sacketts’ property is subject to the
Act, and that they have violated its provisions by placing fill material on the property; and on
this basis it directs them immediately to restore the property pursuant to an EPA work plan.
I
The Clean Water Act prohibits, among other things, “the discharge of any pollutant by any
person” * * * without a permit, into the “navigable waters,”* * * which the Act defines as
“the waters of the United States” * * * . If the EPA determines that any person is in
violation of this restriction, the Act directs the agency either to issue a compliance order or
to initiate a civil enforcement action. § 1319(a)(3). When the EPA prevails in a civil action,
the Act provides for “a civil penalty not to exceed [$37,500] per day for each violation.” * * *
§ 1319(d). And according to the Government, when the EPA prevails against any person
who has been issued a compliance order but has failed to comply, that amount is increased
to $75,000—up to $37,500 for the statutory violation and up to an additional $37,500 for
violating the compliance order.
The particulars of this case flow from a dispute about the scope of “the navigable waters”
subject to this enforcement regime. Today we consider only whether the dispute may be
brought to court by challenging the compliance order—we do not resolve the dispute on the
merits. * * *
The Sacketts * * * own a 2/3-acre residential lot in Bonner County, Idaho. Their property
lies just north of Priest Lake, but is separated from the lake by several lots containing
permanent structures. In preparation for constructing a house, the Sacketts filled in part of
their lot with dirt and rock. Some months later, they received from the EPA a compliance
order. The order contained a number of “Findings and Conclusions,” including the following:
“1.4 [The Sacketts’ property] contains wetlands within the meaning of 33 C.F.R. §
328.4(8)(b); the wetlands meet the criteria for jurisdictional wetlands in the 1987
‘Federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands.’

335

“1.5 The Site’s wetlands are adjacent to Priest Lake within the meaning of 33 C.F.R.
§ 328.4(8)(c). Priest Lake is a ‘navigable water’ within the meaning of section 502(7)
of the Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1362(7), and ‘waters of the United States’ within the meaning
of 40 C.F.R. § 232.2.
“1.6 In April and May, 2007, at times more fully known to [the Sacketts, they] and/or
persons acting on their behalf discharged fill material into wetlands at the Site.
[They] filled approximately one half acre. . . . . .
“1.9 By causing such fill material to enter waters of the United States, [the Sacketts]
have engaged, and are continuing to engage, in the ‘discharge of pollutants’ from a
point source within the meaning of sections 301 and 502(12) of the Act, 33 U.S.C.
§§ 1311 and 1362(12).. . . . .
“1.11 [The Sacketts’] discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States at the
Site without [a] permit constitutes a violation of section 301 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. §
1311.” App. 19–20.
On the basis of these findings and conclusions, the order directs the Sacketts, among other
things, “immediately [to] undertake activities to restore the Site in accordance with [an EPAcreated] Restoration Work Plan” and to “pro- vide and/or obtain access to the Site . . . [and]
access to all records and documentation related to the conditions at the Site . . . to EPA
employees and/or their designated representatives.” Id., at 21–22, ¶¶2.1, 2.7.
The Sacketts, who do not believe that their property is subject to the Act, asked the EPA for
a hearing, but that request was denied. They then brought this action in the United States
District Court for the District of Idaho, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Their
complaint contended that the EPA’s issuance of the compliance order was “arbitrary [and]
capricious” under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) * * * and that it deprived them of
“life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
The District Court dismissed the claims for want of subject- matter jurisdiction, and the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed * * * . It concluded that the Act
“preclude[s] pre-enforcement judicial review of compliance orders,” * * * and that such
preclusion does not violate the Fifth Amendment’s due process guarantee * * * . We
granted certiorari. * * *
II
The Sacketts brought suit under Chapter 7 of the APA, which provides for judicial review of
“final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” 5 U.S.C. §704.
We consider first whether the compliance order is final agency action. There is no doubt it
is agency action, which the APA defines as including even a “failure to act.” §§ 551(13),
701(b)(2). But is it final? It has all of the hallmarks of APA finality that our opinions
336

establish. Through the order, the EPA “ ‘determined’ ” “ ‘rights or obligations.’ ” Bennett v.
Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (quoting Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 71 (1970)). By reason of the order, the
Sacketts have the legal obligation to “restore” their property according to an agencyapproved Restoration Work Plan, and must give the EPA access to their property and to
“records and documentation related to the conditions at the Site.” App. 22, ¶2.7. Also, “
‘legal consequences . . . flow’ ” from issuance of the order. Bennett, supra, at 178 (quoting
Marine Terminal, supra, at 71). For one, according to the Government’s current litigating
position, the order exposes the Sacketts to double penalties in a future enforcement
proceeding.2 It also severely limits the Sacketts’ ability to obtain a permit for their fill from
the Army Corps of Engineers * * * . The Corps’ regulations provide that, once the EPA has
issued a compliance order with respect to certain property, the Corps will not process a
permit application for that property unless doing so “is clearly appropriate.” 33 C.F.R. §
326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011).3
The issuance of the compliance order also marks the “ ‘consummation’ ” of the agency’s
decisionmaking process. Bennett, supra, at 178 (quoting Chicago & Southern Air Lines,
Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U.S.103, 113 (1948)). As the Sacketts learned when
they unsuccessfully sought a hearing, the “Findings and Conclusions” that the compliance
order contained were not subject to further agency review. The Government resists this
conclusion, pointing to a portion of the order that invited the Sacketts to “engage in informal
discussion of the terms and requirements” of the order with the EPA and to inform the
agency of “any allegations [t]herein which [they] believe[d] to be inaccurate.” App. 22–23,
¶2.11. But that confers no entitlement to further agency review. The mere possibility that an
agency might reconsider in light of “informal discussion” and invited contentions of
inaccuracy does not suffice to make an otherwise final agency action nonfinal.
The APA’s judicial review provision also requires that the person seeking APA review of
final agency action have “no other adequate remedy in a court,” 5 U.S.C. § 704. In Clean
Water Act enforcement cases, judicial review ordinarily comes by way of a civil action
brought by the EPA under 33 U.S.C.§ 1319. But the Sacketts cannot initiate that process,
and each day they wait for the agency to drop the hammer, they accrue, by the
Government’s telling, an additional $75,000 in potential liability. The other possible route to
2

…We do not decide today that the Government’s position is correct, but assume the
consequences of the order to be what the Government asserts.
3

The regulation provides this consequence for “enforcement litigation that has been
initiated by other Federal . . . regulatory agencies.” 33 C.F.R. § 326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011). The
Government acknowledges, however, that EPA’s issuance of a compliance order is
considered by the Corps to fall within the provision. * * * Here again, we take the
Government at its word without affirming that it represents a proper interpretation of the
regulation.
337

judicial review—applying to the Corps of Engineers for a permit and then filing suit under
the APA if a permit is denied—will not serve either. The remedy for denial of action that
might be sought from one agency does not ordinarily provide an “adequate remedy” for
action already taken by another agency. The Government, to its credit, does not seriously
contend that other available remedies alone foreclose review under § 704. Instead, the
Government relies on § 701(a)(1) of the APA, which excludes APA review “to the extent
that [other] statutes preclude judicial review.” The Clean Water Act, it says, is such a
statute.
III
Nothing in the Clean Water Act expressly precludes judicial review under the APA or
otherwise. But in determining “[w]hether and to what extent a particular statute precludes
judicial review,” we do not look “only [to] its express language.” Block v. Community
Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340, 345 (1984). The APA, we have said, creates a
“presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action,” but as with most
presumptions, this one “may be overcome by inferences of intent drawn from the statutory
scheme as a whole.” Id., at 349. The Government offers several reasons why the statutory
scheme of the Clean Water Act precludes review.
The Government first points to 33 U.S.C. § 1319(a)(3), which provides that, when the EPA
“finds that any person is in violation” of certain portions of the Act, the agency “shall issue
an order requiring such person to comply with [the Act], or . . . shall bring a civil action [to
enforce the Act].” The Government argues that, because Congress gave the EPA the
choice between a judicial proceeding and an administrative action, it would undermine the
Act to allow judicial review of the latter. But that argument rests on the question-begging
premise that the relevant difference between a compliance order and an enforcement
proceeding is that only the latter is subject to judicial review. There are eminently sound
reasons other than insulation from judicial review why compliance orders are useful. The
Government itself suggests that they “provid[e] a means of notifying recipients of potential
violations and quickly resolving the issues through voluntary compliance.” * * * It is entirely
consistent with this function to allow judicial review when the recipient does not choose
“voluntary compliance.” The Act does not guarantee the EPA that issuing a compliance
order will always be the most effective choice.
The Government also notes that compliance orders are not self-executing, but must be
enforced by the agency in a plenary judicial action. It suggests that Congress therefore
viewed a compliance order “as a step in the deliberative process[,] . . . rather than as a
coercive sanction that itself must be subject to judicial review.” * * * But the APA provides
for judicial review of all final agency actions, not just those that impose a self-executing
sanction. And it is hard for the Government to defend its claim that the issuance of the
compliance order was just “a step in the deliberative process” when the agency rejected the
Sacketts’ attempt to obtain a hearing and when the next step will either be taken by the
338

Sacketts (if they comply with the order) or will involve judicial, not administrative,
deliberation (if the EPA brings an enforcement action). As the text (and indeed the very
name) of the compliance order makes clear, the EPA’s “deliberation” over whether the
Sacketts are in violation of the Act is at an end; the agency may still have to deliberate over
whether it is confident enough about this conclusion to initiate litigation, but that is a
separate subject.
The Government further urges us to consider that Congress expressly provided for prompt
judicial review, on the administrative record, when the EPA assesses administrative
penalties after a hearing, see § 1319(g)(8), but did not expressly provide for review of
compliance orders. But if the express provision of judicial review in one section of a long
and complicated statute were alone enough to over- come the APA’s presumption of
reviewability for all final agency action, it would not be much of a presumption at all.
***
Finally, the Government notes that Congress passed the Clean Water Act in large part to
respond to the inefficiency of then-existing remedies for water pollution. Compliance orders,
as noted above, can obtain quick remediation through voluntary compliance. The
Government warns that the EPA is less likely to use the orders if they are subject to judicial
review. That may be true—but it will be true for all agency actions subjected to judicial
review. The APA’s presumption of judicial review is a repudiation of the principle that
efficiency of regulation conquers all. And there is no reason to think that the Clean Water
Act was uniquely designed to enable the strong-arming of regulated parties into “voluntary
compliance” without the opportunity for judicial review—even judicial review of the question
whether the regulated party is within the EPA’s jurisdiction. Compliance orders will remain
an effective means of securing prompt voluntary compliance in those many cases where
there is no substantial basis to question their validity.
***
We conclude that the compliance order in this case is final agency action for which there is
no adequate remedy other than APA review, and that the Clean Water Act does not
preclude that review. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and
remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring.
Faced with an EPA administrative compliance order threatening tens of thousands of
dollars in civil penalties per day, the Sacketts sued “to contest the jurisdictional bases for
the order.” * * * “As a logical prerequisite to the issuance of the challenged compliance
339

order,” the Sacketts contend, “EPA had to determine that it has regulatory authority over
[our] property.” * * * The Court holds that the Sacketts may immediately litigate their
jurisdictional challenge in federal court. I agree, for the Agency has ruled definitively on
that question. Whether the Sacketts could challenge not only the EPA’s authority to
regulate their land under the Clean Water Act, but also, at this pre-enforcement stage, the
terms and conditions of the compliance order, is a question today’s opinion does not reach
out to resolve. Not raised by the Sacketts here, the question remains open for another day
and case. On that understanding, I join the Court’s opinion.
Questions and Comments
1.

Final agency action: Would the Court have reached the same conclusion regarding
the finality of EPA’s compliance order if the agency did not take the position that it
could double the penalties that it could recover in a judicial enforcement action by
issuing a compliance order? Does the Court believe that EPA is likely to modify a
compliance order based on informal discussions with the alleged violator after the
order is issued? If EPA routinely made such changes, should that affect the Court’s
conclusion?

2.

Preclusion of review: As noted in the Sackett opinion, while the APA includes a
presumption that final agency actions are reviewable, it includes an exception to
reviewability if statutes preclude review. See 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1). As evidenced by
the Court’s opinion in Sackett, the presumption in favor of reviewability is very
strong. Although it can be rebutted either expressly or implicitly, the Sackett Court
was unwilling to find that the Clean Water Act precluded judicial review of
compliance orders despite arguments based on the structure and purposes of the
statute.

3.

Terms of the Order: Did the Court hold that EPA’s order was invalid and that the
agency lacked jurisdiction over the wetlands at issue? If the Sacketts want to
challenge the restoration plan required by the order, or EPA’s requirement that they
provide records to the agency, does the Court’s opinion authorize them to raise
those challenges in court?

4.

Jurisdictional determinations: Sackett involved judicial review of an EPA
compliance order. Would the rationale of the decision also apply to a preliminary or
approved jurisdictional determination? Would they constitute final agency action,
based on the Court’s analysis, or can they be distinguished?

5.

Due Process: Does the Court resolve the Sackett’s due process claim? If so, how?
If not, why not? What sort of a hearing is required by due process? Could a hearing
before an administrative tribunal suffice? Could a hearing after an initial decision by
the government suffice?
340

6.

Impact of decision: How might the Court’s decision affect how frequently EPA
issues administrative compliance orders to address Section 404 violations, as
opposed to using other enforcement tools? How might it impact the documentation
that EPA prepares in support of compliance orders? (Note, though, that EPA
prepared a detailed administrative record supporting its determination that the
Sacketts were discharging fill material into wetlands that were regulated under the
Clean Water Act.)
Is the Court’s decision likely to accelerate resolution of disputes over Clean Water
Act jurisdiction over waters of the United States or will it severely hamper
government enforcement efforts? Are there less stringent alternatives to
administrative compliance orders? Would they be subject to judicial review? At oral
argument, Justice Scalia predicted, “They’ll just issue warnings is what they’ll do.”
See Craig N. Johnston, Sackett: The Road Forward, 42 Envtl. L. 993 (2012); Albert
Ferlo & Tom Lindley, Practical Impacts of the Sackett Decision, 42 Envtl. L. 1009
(2012); Richard E. Glaze Jr., A Detailed Look at the Effects of Sackett v. EPA on
Administrative Enforcement Orders, 42 Envtl. L. Rep. News & Analysis 11030 (Nov.
2012).

7.

Waters of the United States: In a concurring opinion that is not reproduced above,
Justice Alito chastised Congress and EPA for failing to provide concrete rules
outlining the boundaries of federal jurisdiction over “waters of the United States” and
called for Congress to clarify the reach of the statute.

8.

Non-enforcement: The Sackett case involved an APA challenge to an EPA
enforcement order. However, can a person who is upset because EPA or the Corps
are not bringing an enforcement action against someone bring suit against the
agencies based on the APA, since agency action can include a failure to act? See 5
U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985). Could they bring a suit
against EPA or the Corps for non-enforcement under the citizen suit provisions of
the Clean Water Act, alleging that the agencies failed to perform a non-discretionary
duty? See Sierra Club v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 268 F.3d 898 (9th
Cir. 2001).

341

Hypotheticals
1. Walt Pinkman recently observed Jessie White dumping several tons of dirt onto wetlands
on her property to build a new tennis court. He immediately contacted EPA, and the agency
sent an investigator to her house to determine whether she was violating the Clean Water
Act. After conducting an inspection of the property, the EPA investigator issued Jessie a
“notice of violation” under Section 309(a) of the Clean Water Act, which indicated that she
was discharging fill material into “waters of the United States” and that she could potentially
be fined and ordered to restore the wetlands to their natural state. The notice was not,
however, an administrative compliance order, and did not require her to take any immediate
action. Can Jessie challenge the notice in court?
2. Shortly after EPA issued the notice of violation, a representative of the Corps of Engineers
visited the property and issued a preliminary jurisdictional determination, finding that the
wetlands on White’s property may be “waters of the United States”. Can Jessie challenge the
jurisdictional determination in court?
3. When Jessie did not cease her wetland filling activities, EPA issued an administrative
compliance order, notifying her that she was discharging fill material into “waters of the United
States” and ordering her to restore the wetlands pursuant to a restoration plan that was
included in the order. Jessie will not challenge the agency’s determination that the wetlands
on her property are “waters of the United States”, but she would like to challenge the terms of
the restoration plan. Can Jessie challenge the terms of the restoration plan in court?
4. Jessie ultimately applies for a Section 404 permit to authorize the construction of her tennis
court, but the Corps of Engineers denies the permit application on the grounds that there are
practicable alternatives to the project that would have less adverse impacts on the aquatic
environment. Jessie does not appeal the permit denial administratively within the period in
which appeals can be brought. Can Jessie challenge the permit denial in court if she can no
longer challenge it administratively?

2.

Limits on Judicial Review

Even if a litigant can demonstrate that the action of the EPA or the Corps that they wish to
challenge is a final agency action, they may face some additional obstacles to bringing their
lawsuit.
A primary roadblock for some plaintiffs may be the standing requirement. In order to bring
suit, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) they have suffered, or imminently will suffer, an
injury that was caused by the action that they are challenging and which can be
redressed by the relief that they are seeking in the lawsuit; and (2) the interest that they
are suing to protect is arguably within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the
statute under which they are suing. See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997). The first
requirement, the “injury in fact” requirement, derives from Article III of the Constitution,
342

which limits the judicial role to resolving “cases or controversies.” For many years, the
Supreme Court referred to the second requirement, the “zone of interests” requirement, as
a prudential limit imposed on plaintiffs by courts based on concerns for a limited judicial role
in a democratic society. Id. However, in Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control
Components, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1377, 1387 (2014), the Court held that the “zone of interests”
analysis should not be identified as a standing test, prudential or otherwise, and that the
test is not a jurisdictional test. According to the Court, the “zone of interests” analysis still
applies in cases involving challenges to agency actions, but the analysis focuses on the
statutory interpretation question of whether Congress authorized the plaintiff to bring the
cause of action against the agency.” Id.
When a permit applicant is challenging a permit denial, the conditions included in a permit,
or an EPA veto of a permit, or a landowner is challenging a determination that their
property contains waters of the United States, the challenger should have little trouble
demonstrating that they have standing to sue under that test. Normally, the permit denial or
the conditions in the permit will cause the applicant or landowner some economic injury that
can be avoided if the permit is granted or the conditions are removed or altered. Similarly, if
a landowner or permittee has been issued an enforcement order and can demonstrate that
the government’s action is final agency action, they should usually be able to demonstrate
that they meet the requirements for standing. The order will likely cause them some
economic injury or other injury, which could be avoided if the order were rescinded.
However, when neighboring landowners, competitors, or other third parties challenge the
government’s decisions to issue permits, cover activities through general permits, exempt
activities from permitting requirements, or find that property does not contain waters of the
United States, it may be more difficult to demonstrate the standing requirements. See, e.g.
Save Ourselves v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 958 F.2d 659 (5th Cir. 1992). The
plaintiffs may not yet have suffered any injury and may have a difficult time proving that
they will be imminently injured in a concrete way by the government action or that the relief
that they are seeking will redress that injury. Similarly, when regulated entities, interest
groups, or other persons challenge regulations issued by the Corps or EPA, standing may
be an obstacle to suit.
In addition to the standing limitation, a plaintiff may find that their lawsuit against the EPA or
the Corps will be dismissed if it is not brought in a timely manner. While the Clean Water
Act does not have a judicial review provision that establishes time limits for actions against
EPA and the Corps relating to the Section 404 program, the general six year statute of
limitations for civil actions against the United States applies to those lawsuits. See 28
U.S.C. § 2401(a). That statute runs from the time the cause of action first arose. Id. There
are more restrictive time limits for citizen suits against the government for failure to perform
a non-discretionary duty, but those time limits will be discussed in the citizen suit section of
this chapter, since there are few, if any, lawsuits that could be brought against EPA or the
Corps for failure to perform a non-discretionary duty with regard to the Section 404
program. There are also more restrictive time limits that apply to appeals of administrative
343

penalty orders, but they will be discussed in the enforcement section of this chapter.
Even if a plaintiff brings their lawsuit within the six year statute of limitations, a court may
dismiss the action as untimely if the claims in the lawsuit are moot. For instance, in Vieux
Carre Property Owners v. Brown, 948 F.2d 1436 (5th Cir. 1991), the Fifth Circuit held that a
litigant’s claim that the Corps did not comply with the National Environmental Policy Act
when deciding to issue a section 404 permit was moot because the retail complex that was
authorized by the permit was substantially completed at the time of the lawsuit. Similarly, in
Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 277 Fed. Appx. 170 (3d Cir. 2008), the Third
Circuit held that a litigant’s challenge to the Corps’ issuance of a Section 404 permit was
moot when the plaintiff brought the challenge after 98% of the wetlands at issue were filled,
structures had been built for the project and mitigation had been completed.

Standards of Review and Remedies

Since judicial challenges to actions of the Corps and EPA regarding wetlands will be
brought pursuant to APA authority, the judicial review provisions of the APA apply in those
actions. In general, courts review the decisions of EPA and the Corps based on the record
prepared by the agencies to support their decisions and the justifications articulated by the
agencies for those decisions, and do not hold evidentiary hearings or gather new evidence.
See Preserve Endangered Areas of Cobb’s History v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 87
F.3d 1242, 1246-1247 (11th Cir. 1996); Friends of the Earth v. Hintz, 800 F.2d 822, 828-829
(9th Cir. 1986); Avoyelles Sportsmen’s League v. Marsh, 715 F.2d 897, 907 (5th Cir. 1983).
When reviewing the record prepared by the agencies, courts do not generally engage in de
novo review. Instead, they review the agencies’ decisions under very deferential standards.
The judicial review provisions of the APA indicate that a reviewing court shall
“(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to
be
(A)
arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in
accordance with law;
(B)
contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;
(C)
in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or
short of statutory right;
(D)
without observance of procedure required by law;
(E)
unsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to
sections 556 and 557 of this title or otherwise reviewed on the record
of an agency hearing provided by statute; or
(F)
unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject
to trial de novo by the reviewing court.”
See 5 U.S.C. § 706.
344

As noted in earlier chapters, when a court reviews an agency’s interpretation of a statute
adopted through legislative rulemaking or in some other contexts, the court will apply the
Chevron analysis. See Chapter 4, supra. If the court is not reviewing an agency’s
interpretation of a statute, it will normally review the agency’s decision under the arbitrary
and capricious standard, another deferential standard, and uphold the agency’s decision
as long as it is reasonable. As the Supreme Court has indicated, the arbitrary and
capricious standard of review “is a narrow one” and the “court is not empowered to
substitute its judgment for that of the agency.” See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc.
v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415 (1971).
If the reviewing court ultimately decides that an action taken by the Corps or EPA is
arbitrary and capricious, the court will usually set aside the decision and remand the matter
to the agency to reconsider. On remand, the agency can resolve the matter differently than
it did initially, but it is also free to make the same decision as it made initially, as long as it
addresses the court’s concerns and can support the decision as reasonable. See Securities
and Exchange Commission v. Chenery, 332 U.S. 194 (1947).
Questions and Comments
1.

Beyond the record: While APA review of most actions of the Corps and EPA is
limited to the administrative record prepared by the agency, in rare situations, a
court may take evidence if the record is incomplete or if there is a strong showing of
bad faith or improper behavior.

2.

Intervention: Since the judicial review provisions of the Clean Water Act do not
apply to review of actions of the Corps or EPA regarding Section 404, intervention in
lawsuits against the Corps and EPA is governed by the normal federal rules of civil
procedure. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24.

The Corps of Engineers and EPA share
enforcement authority over Section 404
violations under the Clean Water Act. In
1989, the agencies entered into a
Memorandum of Agreement to coordinate
their enforcement activities. See U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency & U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Memorandum of Agreement: Federal Enforcement for the
Section 404 Program of the Clean Water Act (Jan. 19, 1989). Pursuant to the agreement, in
most cases, the Corps conducts initial investigations of Section 404 violations, making a
determination of whether waters of the United States are present on the property where a
345

discharge occurred and whether there has been a violation of Section 404. Id. While the
Corps conducts most initial investigations, the memorandum provides that EPA will
normally be the lead enforcement agency for discharges where the violator does not have a
permit, while the Corps will be the lead enforcement agency for discharges that violate a
Corps permit. Id.
As noted in Chapter 4, supra, the prohibition on filling wetlands derives from Section 301 of
the Clean Water Act, which, when read in conjunction with Section 502 (the definition
section), prohibits the addition of a pollutant into navigable waters from a point source
by a person unless the person is adding the pollutant in accordance with a Section 404
permit or a Section 402 permit, and is complying with other requirements of the statute
listed in Section 301. See 33 U.S.C. § 1311. Section 404 permits are issued to authorize
the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344.
Thus, if the Corps or EPA bring an enforcement action against someone for filling wetlands
without a Section 404 permit or in violation of a Section 404 permit, they have the burden
of proving that there was an addition of a pollutant into navigable waters from a point
source by a person (to demonstrate a violation of section 301) and that there was a
discharge of dredged or fill material (to demonstrate that a Section 404 permit, rather than
a Section 402 permit, was required.) If the enforcement action is based on violation of the
terms or conditions of a Section 404 permit, the government has the burden of proving that
the defendant violated the permit terms or conditions. If the defendant argues that a
Section 404 permit is not required because the activity that caused the alleged violation
was exempt from the permit requirement or because it was covered by a general permit,
the defendant has the burden of proof.
Except in criminal enforcement proceedings, in making out the prima facie case, the
government does not have to prove that the defendant acted with a specific mental state.
The government merely has to prove that the defendant took the action that was prohibited
by the Clean Water Act. See Kelly v. United States, 203 F.3d 519 (7th Cir. 2000); Stoddard
v. Western Carolina Regional Sewer Authority, 784 F.2d 1200 (4th Cir. 1986). The statute
defines “person” broadly to include an “individual, corporation, partnership, association,
State, municipality, commission, or political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body.”
See 33 U.S.C. § 1362(5). EPA’s regulations clarify that a Federal agency, its agents and
employees, and an “agent or employee” of any entity listed in the statutory definition can
also be liable as a “person”. See 40 C.F.R. § 232.2.
The enforcement process begins when EPA or the Corps learn about a potential section
404 violation. The Corps encourages members of the public to report violations, see 33
C.F.R. § 326.3(a), so the government may become aware of violations from citizen
complaints. In addition, the Corps works with state, local and other federal agencies to
watch for potential violations, so the Corps or one its partners may discover a violation
through its surveillance program. Id. The Corps relies on those tools to identify violations of
permit conditions as well as unpermitted discharges, because, unlike other environmental
346

statutes, the Clean Water Act does not require Section 404 permittees to monitor their
activities or file periodic reports with the Corps. EPA has limited field resources and relies
on reports from citizens or referrals from the Corps or other federal agencies to identify
potential violations. However, a 2009 report of EPA’s Office of Inspector General found that
the agency’s passive and reactive approach to wetlands enforcement was not effective in
identifying violations. See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Inspector
General, 10-P-0009, EPA Needs a Better Strategy to Identify Violations of Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act (Oct. 6, 2009). Consequently, the Inspector General recommended
that the agency implement “a § 404 enforcement strategy that includes increased
communication/coordination with enforcement partners, a system to track repeat and
flagrant violators, performance measures, and cross-training” and the agency agreed to
make those changes. Id. at 6.
Once the Corps or EPA discover a potential violation, they can choose from a broad range
of administrative and judicial enforcement options, including both civil and criminal
sanctions. The Clean Water Act gives the agencies broad discretion to choose the
appropriate enforcement tool and does not mandate a specific type of enforcement action
for any particular violation.

Example of an EPA compliance order

Most violations will be resolved administratively, rather than in court. The least stringent
enforcement tools available to the agencies are notices of violation and administrative
orders. The Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to issue orders (administrative compliance
orders) that require persons to comply with the Clean Water Act or with Section 404
permits that are issued by States, see 33 U.S.C. § 1319(a)(3), and authorizes the Corps to
issue orders (cease and desist letters) that require persons to comply with the terms and
conditions of Section 404 permits that the Corps issued. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(s). If a
permittee has already completed the fill activity that violates a permit, the Corps will usually
issue a notice of violation and request for remedial action, instead of a cease and desist
letter. See 33 C.F.R. § 326.3(c). When EPA issues an administrative compliance order or
the Corps issues a cease and desist letter, the agencies provide a copy of the order or
letter to the state where the violation occurred and any other states affected by the
violation. See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1319(a)(4); 1344(s)(2).
If the person who receives an order does not comply with the order, the agencies can only
enforce the order by bringing an action in court, id. §§ 1319(b); 1344(s)(3). As the Sackett
347

Court noted, in a judicial action to enforce an administrative order, the government will seek
to recover penalties for the violation of the order, as well as for the violation that led to the
issuance of the order.
Although the Clean Water Act does not explicitly authorize persons who receive
administrative compliance orders or cease and desist letters to challenge them in court, the
Sackett Court held that the recipient of an EPA administrative compliance order could
challenge the agency’s jurisdictional determination in that order in court. The Court’s
decision did not, however, address cease and desist letters of the Corps.

Administrative Penalty Orders

Resources
EPA’s Administrative Penalty Regulations
Corps’ Administrative Penalty Regulations
EPA’s Civil Penalty Policy
EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board

Both EPA and the Corps have authority
to impose administrative penalties on
violators. Section 309(g) authorizes both
agencies to assess civil penalties on
persons who fill wetlands without a
permit (or otherwise violate the Clean
Water Act) or who violate the terms or conditions of a permit, although, as noted above, the
Corps generally takes the lead on violations of permits issued by the Corps. See 33 U.S.C.
§ 1319(g)(1). The statute establishes two categories of administrative penalties, based on
the severity of the violation. Class I penalties may not exceed $11,000 per violation or
$32,500 overall, and Class II penalties may not exceed $11,000 per day of violation or
$157,500 overall. See 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(2); 40 C.F.R. § 19.4. (Note: The original
maximum penalty amounts in the statute were lower, and were increased by the Debt
Collection Improvement Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3701).
For Class I penalties, the statute requires the government to provide notice and an
opportunity for a hearing before assessing a penalty. See 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(2)(A). The
hearing is an informal hearing, though, and the statute only requires the government to
provide the potential recipient of the order “a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to
present evidence.” Id.
For Class II penalties, the statute requires the government to provide notice and the
opportunity for a formal hearing following the procedures of the APA (5 U.S.C. § 554)
before assessing a penalty. See 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(2)(B).
In determining the amount of the penalties, the statute directs the agencies to “take into
account the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation, or violations, and,
with respect to the violator, ability to pay, any prior history of such violations, the degree of
culpability, economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, and such other
matters as justice may require.” Id. § 1319(g)(3).
348

For both types of penalties, the Corps or EPA must also provide public notice of the
proposed penalty order and an opportunity to comment on the order before issuing the
order. See 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(4). Unlike administrative compliance orders, the statute
explicitly provides that persons who are assessed an administrative penalty or persons who
commented on the administrative penalty order can challenge the order in court, as long as
they challenge the order within 30 days. Id. § 1319(g)(8). Class I penalties must be
challenged in federal district court, while Class II penalties must be challenged in the
federal appellate courts. Id. The general rules regarding judicial review, discussed above
(i.e. review limited to the record, application of the arbitrary and capricious standard), apply
to review of these orders. However, if the Class II penalties are issued after a formal
hearing, the appellate court reviews the agency’s factual findings under the substantial
evidence test. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(E).
Before challenging an administrative penalty order in court, recipients of the orders must
exhaust their administrative remedies. There is no administrative appeal process for Class I
penalty orders, so recipients can challenge those orders immediately. However, recipients
of a Class II penalty order must appeal the order administratively before challenging the
order in court. See 40 C.F.R. § 22.27(d).
If the Corps or EPA issues an administrative penalty order and the recipient does not
comply with the order, the Clean Water Act authorizes the government to bring an action in
federal district court to recover the penalties. See 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(9). Significantly, in
that action, “the validity, amount and appropriateness of ...[the] penalty shall not be subject
to review.” Id.
Questions and Comments
1.

Jury Trial: When courts review administrative penalty orders, they generally limit
review of the order to the record created by the agency and review the decision
based on the arbitrary and capricious standard. In Sasser v. Administrator, 990 F.2d
127 (4th Cir. 1993), the Fourth Circuit rejected an argument that such a procedure
violated the order recipient’s 7th Amendment right to a jury trial. The court concluded
that the case involved a dispute over “statutory public rights,” to which the 7 th
Amendment did not apply.

2.

Civil Penalty Policy: While the statute outlines criteria for EPA and the Corps to
consider in determining the amount of administrative penalties, EPA has also
developed a civil penalty policy to establish uniformity and consistency in calculating
administrative and judicial civil penalties for Clean Water Act Section 404 violations.
See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Issuance of Revised CWA Section 404
Settlement Penalty Policy (Dec. 21, 2001). The policy identifies the minimum
amounts that the agency should recover in settlements, but acknowledges that the
349

agency will seek and attempt to recover more if settlement is not possible. The
policy creates the following formula for determining the minimum civil penalty:
Penalty = Economic Benefit + (Preliminary Gravity Amount +/- Gravity
Adjustment Factors) - Litigation Considerations - Ability to Pay - Mitigation
Credit for SEPs.
Id. at 8. Under the formula, EPA is primarily concerned with ensuring that the
violator does not receive any economic benefit by violating the statute. The agency
calculates the economic benefit using a computer model (BEN). Id. at 9. In
calculating and adjusting the “gravity” of the violation, the agency assigns numerical
rankings to factors such as harm to human health or welfare, extent of impacts,
severity of impacts, duration of violation, degree of culpability, compliance history of
the violator, and the need for deterrence, among others. Id. at 9-15. After
determining an appropriate penalty based on the economic benefit and gravity
factors, the agency may reduce the penalty that it is seeking based on litigation
considerations (i.e. weaknesses in the case), the ability of the violator to pay, and
the violator’s agreement to implement a supplemental environmental project (SEP).
SEPs are “environmentally beneficial projects that a violator agrees to undertake as
part of a settlement, but is not otherwise legally obligated to perform.” Id. at 20.
Thus, EPA may be willing to reduce the penalty it assesses a violator when the
violator agrees to take an environmentally beneficial action that the agency could
not have forced them to take otherwise.
3.

B.

After the fact permits: In addition to the administrative options outlined above,
when the Corps discovers an illegal discharge of dredged or fill material, it can issue
an “after the fact” permit to authorize the discharge, which protects the violator from
further enforcement action. See 33 C.F.R. § 326.3(e). As noted in Chapter 6, supra,
the illegal discharger must follow the normal permit application procedures, the
Corps processes the application through the normal procedures for individual
permits, and EPA retains the right to veto the permit. The Corps regulations provide,
though, that the Corps will not accept an after the fact permit application when the
district engineer determines that legal action is appropriate, or where federal, state
or local regulatory agencies have
initiated litigation against the applicant.

they do not have to pursue administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief. Similarly,
they can pursue judicial relief even though they have already pursued administrative
remedies.
The Clean Water Act authorizes the government to seek a broad range of civil and criminal
penalties for violations of the statute, although the Department of Justice brings the
lawsuits on behalf of the agencies. While EPA’s regulations do not indicate precisely the
violations that would motivate the agency to refer a case to the Department of Justice for
judicial enforcement, the Corps’ regulations suggest that appropriate cases for referral
involve violations that are “willful, repeated, flagrant, or of substantial impact.” See 33
C.F.R. § 326.5. In addition, in 1990, EPA and the Corps issued guidance regarding judicial
enforcement priorities. See U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Guidance on Judicial Civil and Criminal Enforcement Priorities (Dec.
1990). As part of that guidance, the agencies suggested that enforcement personnel should
consider the following factors when deciding whether to refer a case for civil enforcement:
(1) quality of the waters affected; (2) impact of the discharge; (3) culpability of the violator;
(4) deterrence value; (5) benefit from the violation; and (6) equitable considerations. Id.
1.

Civil Enforcement

The Clean Water Act authorizes EPA and the Corps to seek civil penalties and injunctive
relief for any violations of the Clean Water Act, the terms and conditions of any Section 404
permit, or any administrative orders issued under the Act. See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1319(b), (d);
1344(s). The lawsuits must be brought in federal district court in the district in which the
defendant is located, resides, or does business, and the government must notify the state
where the discharge occurs when the government files the suit. Id. The government will
normally refrain from filing suit if a state is pursuing an enforcement action, but the statute
does not preclude federal enforcement simply because a state is also bringing an
enforcement action.
In an enforcement action under the Clean Water Act, courts can award penalties up to
$37,500 per day per violation. Id. Although the statute originally authorized a maximum
penalty of $25,000 per day per violation, the amount has been increased over time in
accordance with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2461, as
amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3701. See 40 C.F.R. §
19.4. The government takes the position, and several courts have agreed, that each day
that dredged or fill material remains in place constitutes a separate day of violation. See,
e.g. United States v. Cumberland Farms of Conn., Inc., 647 F. Supp. 1166, 1183 (D. Mass.
1986), aff’d 826 F.2d 1151 (1st Cir. 1987), cert denied 484 U.S. 1061 (1988); United States
v. Tull, 615 F. Supp. 610, 626 (E.D. Va. 1983), aff’d 769 F.2d 182 (4th Cir. 1985), rev’d on
other grounds 481 U.S. 412 (1987). Under this “continuing violation” theory, therefore, if a
defendant illegally filled wetlands, the defendant would be subject to $37,500 penalties not
only for each day during which the filling occurred, but also for each day during which the
351

fill remained in place.
Just as the statute outlines factors for the agencies to consider in determining an
appropriate administrative penalty amount, the statute identifies a similar list of factors that
courts should consider in determining the amount of civil penalties. The statute directs
courts to consider the following factors in setting civil penalties: “the seriousness of the
violation or violations, the economic benefit (if any) resulting from the violation, any history
of such violations, any good-faith efforts to comply with the applicable requirements, the
economic impact of the penalty on the violator, and such other matters as justice may
require.” See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1319(d); 1344(s). Since the factors outlined in the statute are
similar for administrative and judicial penalties, the Department of Justice relies on the
same EPA civil penalty policy in judicial settlement negotiations as the agency relies on in
administrative settlement negotiations. Ultimately, the penalties that are recovered are paid
into the general fund of the United States Treasury, and are not paid to EPA, the Corps or
the Department of Justice.
In addition to civil penalties, the statute authorizes courts to award declaratory relief and
temporary and permanent injunctive relief. See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1319(b), (d); 1344(s).
Pursuant to that authority, courts frequently order defendants to cease any discharging
activities, remove dredged or fill material, and to restore sites where dredged or fill material
has been discharged to their condition before the filling activity occurred. If restoration is
not possible, the government will normally seek appropriate mitigation.
The statute does not include a statute of limitations, so courts apply the general five year
limit on federal civil penalty actions to Clean Water Act civil penalty suits. See 28 U.S.C. §
2462. However, courts have held that the statute does not begin to run until the
government becomes aware of the violation, see United States v. Hobbs, 736 F. Supp.
1406 (E.D. Va. 1990), aff’d 947 F.2d 941 (4th Cir. 1991), cert. denied 504 U.S. 940 (1992),
and the statute does not apply to suits for injunctive relief, so courts can order defendants
to cease prohibited activities, remove dredged or fill material, and restore wetlands, even
though the five year statutory time period for a civil penalty action has expired. See United
States v. Banks, 115 F.3d 916, 919 (11th Cir. 1997).
Although most cases settle before trial, if a Clean Water Act enforcement action reaches
the trial stage, the Supreme Court has held that defendants have a constitutional right to a
jury trial in those actions. See Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. 412 (1987). However, the Tull
Court only held that defendants have a right to a jury trial on the issue of liability. Id. As a
result, the judge, rather than the jury, determines the appropriate remedy, regardless of
whether the remedy is a civil penalty or injunctive relief. In addition, if the government is
only seeking injunctive relief, there is no constitutional right to a jury trial, even on liability,
since the Seventh Amendment right is limited to actions at common law. See U.S. Const.,
Amend. VII.

352

As noted above, in an enforcement action, the government has the burden of proving all of
the elements of a Section 301/404 violation, while the defendant has the burden of proving
any affirmative defenses. The statute does not identify specific affirmative defenses, but a
defendant might argue that their activity is exempt from the Section 404 permit requirement
or is covered by a general permit. In addition, to the extent that a permittee is complying
with a Section 404 permit, including a general permit, the Clean Water Act provides that the
permittee is complying with Sections 301, 307 and 403 of the Act, for purposes of federal
enforcement actions and citizen suits. See 33 U.S.C. § 1344(p).
A defendant cannot avoid an enforcement action by arguing that the application of the
Clean Water Act constitutes a taking of their property. See United States v. Riverside
Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121 (1985). While the defendant can bring a separate
action for a taking of property, see Chapter 11, infra, the claim is not a defense to an
enforcement action.
Research Problems
While DOJ makes pending consent decrees available online, once the decrees are finalized, it is more
difficult to search for them online. Consent decrees involving EPA are available on Lexis and on EPA’s
website, as noted above. Consent decrees involving the Corps are not available on Lexis, Westlaw, or
the agency’s website. Without using Lexis, please answer the following questions:
1. In 2012, the U.S. and defendants resolved the case of United States v. Snowden, involving illegal fill
of wetlands at Falls Creek Farm in Sterling, Connecticut, through a consent decree. What was the
amount of civil penalties that the defendants agreed to pay? What are the amounts of stipulated
penalties that the parties agreed upon in the event that the defendants fail to timely fulfill requirements
of the consent decree?
2. Pursuant to the consent decree in United States v. Savoy Senior Housing Corporation, what is the
total amount of money that the defendants agreed to pay as civil penalties and to fund the injunctive
relief required by the decree? Can representatives of the United States enter the defendants’ property to
oversee the restoration activities under the consent decree?

Criminal Enforcement

criminal prosecution. The Clean Water
Act authorizes criminal prosecution for
negligent violations, knowing violations,
and knowing endangerment (placing
someone in danger of death or injury). See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1319(c)(1)-(3). For purposes of
criminal sanctions, the statute defines “person” to include “responsible corporate officers”.
Id. § 1319(c)(6). The government normally refrains from bringing criminal enforcement
actions unless the defendant’s action caused significant environmental harm, the defendant
continued to engage in illegal conduct after repeated warnings from the Corps or EPA, or
the defendant will receive significant economic benefit from continuing to violate the statute.
Conversely, when a person self-reports a violation, discovered a violation through an
environmental audit, or implements compliance programs to improve compliance after
discovering a violation, the government will be less likely to pursue a criminal action against
the person. See U.S. Department of Justice, Environment and Natural Resources Division,
Factors in Decisions on Criminal Prosecutions for Environmental Violations in the Context
of Significant Voluntary Compliance or Disclosure Efforts by the Violator (July 1, 1991). The
government generally prefers to prosecute high visibility cases, to maximize the deterrent
effect of the prosecution.
Courts can impose fines between $2,500 and $25,000 per day per violation and
imprisonment up to one year for negligent violations of the Clean Water Act. Id. §
1319(c)(1). For knowing violations, courts can impose fines that are twice as high and
imprisonment for up to three years. Id. § 1319(c)(2). Finally, for knowing endangerment,
courts can impose fines up to $250,000 per violation (or $1,000,000 per violation for
organizations) and imprisonment for up to fifteen years. Id. § 1319(c)(3). In all cases, the
maximum penalties are doubled for violations committed after the defendant has been
previously convicted. See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1319(c)(1)-(3). According to EPA’s website, the
most significant criminal wetlands case involved the development of a subdivision that
impacted 260 acres. In that case, United States v. Lucas, 516 F.3d 316 (5th Cir. 2008), the
court fined Robert Lucas Jr, his daughter and his engineer $15,000 each, assessed
restitution of $1,407,400 for each defendant, and fined Lucas’ two companies $5,300,000.
See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Section 404 Enforcement.

Because we conclude that 33 C.F.R. § 328.3(a)(3) (1993) (defining waters of the United
States to include those waters whose degradation "could affect" interstate commerce) is
unauthorized by the Clean Water Act as limited by the Commerce Clause and therefore is
invalid, and that the district court erred in failing to require mens rea with respect to each
element of an offense defined by the Act, we reverse and remand for a new trial.
In February 1996, after a seven-week trial, a jury convicted James J. Wilson, Interstate
General Co., L.P., and St. Charles Associates, L.P., on four felony counts charging them
with knowingly discharging fill material and excavated dirt into wetlands on four separate
parcels without a permit, in violation of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1319(c)(2)(A) &
1311(a). The district court sentenced Wilson to 21 months imprisonment and 1 year
supervised release and fined him $1 million. It fined the other two defendants $3 million and
placed them on 5 years probation. The court also ordered the defendants to implement a
wetlands restoration and mitigation plan proposed by the government.
Wilson, a land developer with more than 30 years of experience, was the chief executive
officer and chairman of the board of directors of Interstate General. He was personally
responsible for various decisions relevant to the defendants' convictions in this case.
Interstate General was a publicly traded land development company with 340 employees,
2,000 shareholders, and assets of over $100 million. It was the general partner of St.
Charles Associates, a limited partnership that owned the land being developed within the
planned community of St. Charles, which lies between the Potomac River and the
Chesapeake Bay in Charles County, Maryland. The convictions involve discharges onto
four parcels that are part of St. Charles.
***
At trial, the government introduced evidence that during the period from 1988 to 1993, the
defendants attempted to drain at least three of the four parcels of land involved in this case
by digging ditches. The excavated dirt was deposited next to the ditches--a process known
355

as "sidecasting." The government also introduced evidence that the defendants transported
a substantial amount of fill dirt and gravel and deposited it on three of the parcels; only one
parcel involved sidecasting without the addition of fill. The government presented evidence
that all four of these parcels contained wetlands and that the defendants failed to obtain
permits from the Army Corps of Engineers * * * prior to making efforts to drain and fill the
parcels.
Although the parcels in question were not, because of neighboring development, located in
pristine wilderness areas, the government presented substantial evidence about the
physical characteristics which identified them as wetlands, including testimonial and
photographic evidence of significant standing water, reports of vegetation typical to
hydrologic soils, and infrared aerial photographs showing a pattern of stream courses
visible under the vegetation. Evidence also showed that the properties were identified as
containing wetlands on public documents including the National Wetlands Inventory Map
and topographical maps of Charles County and the State of Maryland. The government
demonstrated that water from these lands flowed in a drainage pattern through ditches,
intermittent streams, and creeks, ultimately joining the Potomac River, a tributary of the
Chesapeake Bay.
The government also produced evidence of the defendants' awareness of the physical
conditions of their land. The very development work underlying the present prosecution
involved efforts to improve the drainage of the areas to make building feasible. Substantial
fill was later added in an attempt to raise the ground level of the parcels. Some construction
work involved repeated reshoring efforts because of wetness-induced ground shifting and
collapse. Evidence was introduced that bids for work at one of the parcels actually
contained different price quotations for wet and dry work because of the level of moisture
on parts of the property. And witnesses gave testimony that despite the attempts at drying
the property through ditching and draining or through the pumping off of standing water,
and even after hundreds of truck loads of stone, gravel and other fill had been added to
three of the parcels, wetland-loving plants continued to sprout through the fill.
Witnesses also testified at trial that a private consulting firm retained by the defendants
informed the defendants that its observations of conditions on the parcels led it to conclude
that the parcels contained wetlands. The firm recommended seeking permits from the
Army Corps of Engineers before beginning development. The defendants were also
contacted by Charles County zoning authorities concerned about the possible presence of
wetlands in the vicinity of the new construction projects. Finally, the government presented
evidence that even as the defendants complied with an Army Corps of Engineers order to
cease construction on one of the parcels and remove fill dirt that had already been added,
they continued to develop the other parcels without notifying the Corps or making an effort
to ascertain whether a permit was necessary.
The defendants introduced contradictory evidence suggesting that whether the four parcels
356

were wetlands under the Clean Water Act was unclear. They offered evidence which they
claim showed that the Army Corps of Engineers was inconsistent in asserting jurisdiction
over the parcels in question, claiming that the Corps took action on only one parcel, even
though it had been aware for years of the ongoing development. Defendants also
introduced an internal Corps memorandum that stated that while the areas in the St.
Charles community have the "necessary parameters ... to be considered wetlands when
using the Corps Wetland Delineation Manual," "it is not clear to me that these areas can be
interpreted as 'waters of the United States' within the meaning or purview of Section 404."
That memo suggested obtaining guidance from higher authority as to what constitutes
"waters of the United States." The defendants also introduced evidence indicating their
belief that they had legally drained three parcels prior to introducing fill, and that no fill was
discharged into the fourth which was being drained by the digging of ditches.
Following 15 hours of deliberation, the jury convicted all defendants of the four felony
counts. Because of the felony convictions, the defendants were not convicted of four
misdemeanor counts for the "negligent" violations of the Clean Water Act involving the
same parcels.
***
V
The defendants * * * contend that the district court erred in instructing the jury about the
criminal intent, the "mens rea," required to prove a felony violation of the Clean Water Act.
They argue (1) that the statute requires a showing that they were aware of the illegality of
their conduct, and (2) that the required mens rea, however it is defined, must accompany
each element of the offense. They note that the district court's jury instructions comported
with neither requirement.
The district court charged the jury that the government must prove each of four elements of
the offense beyond a reasonable doubt:
First, that is the defendant knowingly ... discharged or caused to be discharged a
pollutant.
Second, that the pollutant was [dis]charged from a point source.
Third, that the pollutant entered a water of the United States; and fourth, that the
discharge was unpermitted.
The court defined an act as "knowingly" done "if it is done voluntarily and intentionally and
not because of ignorance, mistake, accident or other innocent reason." For each felony
count, the court stated,
357

the government must prove that the defendants knew, one, that the areas which are
the subject of these discharges had the general characteristics of wetland; and, two,
the general nature of their acts. The government does not have to prove that the
defendants knew the actual legal status of wetlands or the actual legal status of the
materials discharged into the wetlands. The government does not have to prove that
the defendants knew that they were violating the law when they committed their
acts. (Emphasis added).
Finally, the court instructed on willful blindness, which it stated could stand in the place of
actual knowledge.
Determining the mens rea requirement of a felony violation of the Clean Water Act requires
us to make an interpretation based on "construction of the statute and ... inference of the
intent of Congress." * * * We thus begin our analysis by looking at the language of 33
U.S.C. § 1319, as well as its place in the larger statutory structure.
Section 1319(c)(2)(A), making an illegal discharge of a pollutant a felony if accompanied by
the defined mens rea, provides: "Any person who knowingly violates section 1311 ... shall
be punished." (Emphasis added). Section 1311 makes unlawful "the discharge of any
pollutant" without a permit. And finally, § 1362 defines "discharge of a pollutant" to include
"any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source" and defines
"navigable waters" as "waters of the United States." * * * Within that statutory structure, we
must determine the nature of intent that the statute requires for each element of the
offense.
On a first reading of the clause, "any person who knowingly violates section 1311 shall be
punished," the order of words suggests that "knowingly" modifies "violates" so that the
clause imposes punishment only when one violates the statute with knowledge that he is
violating it, i.e. with knowledge of the illegality of his conduct. But the statute's structure, the
architecture of which includes a series of sections incorporating other sections, its
legislative history, and the body of Supreme Court jurisprudence addressing mens rea of
federal criminal statutes caution that our first reading may not so simply lead us to the
proper interpretation.
Our first concern is a pragmatic one engendered by the overall structure of the Clean Water
Act. The conduct that is made criminal with the "knowingly violates" language
encompasses numerous elements from other substantive statutory sections. See 33 U.S.C.
§ 1319(c)(2)(A). Each of those substantive sections may also be enforced with other civil
and criminal penalties if the actions proscribed therein are performed with different scienter.
See generally 33 U.S.C. § 1319. If Congress intended that the "knowing" mens rea
accompany each element of the offense, as we have previously assumed is the case, * * *
the task of inserting the alternative mens rea requirements for the multiple civil and criminal
358

enforcement provisions within each substantive prohibition would require confusingly
repetitious drafting. A shorthand method of accomplishing the same purpose thus would be
to insert "knowingly" in a single place where the conduct is made criminal, in this case, §
1319(c)(2)(A). See United States v. International Minerals & Chemical Corp., 402 U.S. 558,
562 (1971) (the phrase "knowingly violates [applicable regulations]" was "a shorthand
designation for specific acts or omissions which violate the act").
Our second and more profound problem with our first-blush interpretative proposal arises
from a recognition of two general common law principles regarding mens rea. First, in
Anglo-American jurisprudence, criminal offenses are ordinarily required to have a mens
rea. * * * This supposition is based on "the contention that an injury can amount to a crime
only when inflicted by intention." * * * Indeed, statutes requiring no mens rea are generally
disfavored. * * * But a second and deeply-rooted common law principle is that ignorance of
the law provides no defense to its violation. * * * Thus, while some level of deliberateness
is usually required to impose criminal punishment, it is also usually true that the defendant
need not appreciate the illegality of his conduct. Applying those principles to a statute
similar to the one before us, the Supreme Court in International Minerals declined "to
attribute to Congress the inaccurate view that [the] Act requires proof of knowledge of the
law, as well as the facts." * * * In that case, the statute--which provided that whoever
"knowingly violates any such regulation" shall be fined or imprisoned--was held to be a
"shorthand designation" for knowledge of the specific acts or omissions which violate the
Act. * * * When so viewed, the Court noted, "the Act ... does not signal an exception to the
rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse." * * * In light of these background rules of
common law, we may conclude that mens rea requires not that a defendant know that his
conduct was illegal, but only that he "know the facts that make his conduct illegal," * * *
unless Congress clearly specifies otherwise. And this knowledge must generally be proven
with respect to each element of the offense. * * *
Finally, our first-blush reading of the phrase "knowingly violates" is cast into doubt by the
legislative history, which suggests that Congress, by amending the statute in 1987,
intended to facilitate enforcement of the Clean Water Act and increase the impact of
sanctions by creating a separate felony provision for deliberate, as distinct from negligent,
activity. Before the amendment, the Act imposed a single set of criminal penalties for "willful
or negligent" violations. See 33 U.S.C. § 1319(d)(1) (1986). The 1987 amendments,
however, segregated the penalties for negligent violations, making them misdemeanors,
and added felony provisions for knowing violations. See 33 U.S.C. § 1319(c)(1)(A)
("negligent" violation) & § 1319(c)(2)(A) ("knowing" violation). Thus, before 1987, the
statute proscribed "willful or negligent" violations and after 1987 it proscribed separate
"knowing" and "negligent" violations. In changing from "willful" to "knowing," we should
assume that Congress intended to effect a change in meaning. * * * Because "willful"
generally connotes a conscious performance of bad acts with an appreciation of their
illegality, * * * we can conclude that Congress intended to provide a different and lesser
standard when it used the word "knowingly." If we construe the word "knowingly" as
359

requiring that the defendant must appreciate the illegality of his acts, we obliterate its
distinction from the willfulness.
Based upon these interpretative guides, then, we cannot conclude that Congress intended
to require the defendant to know that his conduct was illegal when it stated that "Any
person who knowingly violates [incorporated statutory sections] ... shall be punished." The
ready alternative interpretation is that Congress intended that the defendant have
knowledge of each of the elements constituting the proscribed conduct even if he were
unaware of their legal significance. This interpretation would not carry with it the corollary
that the defendant's ignorance of his conduct's illegality provides him a defense, but would
afford a defense for a mistake of fact. Thus, if a defendant thought he was discharging
water when he was in fact discharging gasoline, he would not be guilty of knowingly
violating the act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants. See United States v. Ahmad,
101 F.3d 386, 393 (5th Cir.1996); see also International Minerals, 402 U.S. at 563-64 * * *
Accordingly, we hold that the Clean Water Act * * * requires the government to prove the
defendant's knowledge of facts meeting each essential element of the substantive offense,
* * * but need not prove that the defendant knew his conduct to be illegal * * * .
In light of our conclusion that the government need only prove the defendant's knowledge
of the facts meeting each essential element of the substantive offense and not the fact that
defendant knew his conduct to be illegal, in order to establish a felony violation of the Clean
Water Act, we hold that it must prove: (1) that the defendant knew that he was discharging
a substance, eliminating a prosecution for accidental discharges; (2) that the defendant
correctly identified the substance he was discharging, not mistaking it for a different,
unprohibited substance; (3) that the defendant knew the method or instrumentality used to
discharge the pollutants; (4) that the defendant knew the physical characteristics of the
property into which the pollutant was discharged that identify it as a wetland, such as the
presence of water and water-loving vegetation; (5) that the defendant was aware of the
facts establishing the required link between the wetland and waters of the United States;*
and (6) that the defendant knew he did not have a permit. This last requirement does not
require the government to show that the defendant knew that permits were available or
required. Rather, it, like the other requirements, preserves the availability of a mistake of
fact offense if the defendant has something he mistakenly believed to be a permit to make
the discharges for which he is being prosecuted.
While we thus reject the defendants' challenge to the district court's instructions based on
the contention that the government must prove awareness of the illegality of their conduct,
we agree that the instructions did not adequately impose on the government the burden of
proving knowledge with regard to each statutory element. For this reason, a new trial is
required.

Questions and Comments
1.

Compare the instructions given by the trial court regarding the prima facie case to
the instructions required by the appellate court. Do you understand the difference?

2.

Mistake of fact v. mistake of law: Note that the Court suggests that a mistake of
fact defense may still be available in a criminal prosecution for a wetlands violation,
even though a mistake of law defense is not. If the wetlands at issue were not
adjacent to a traditionally navigable water, could a defendant avoid criminal liability
by providing evidence that the defendant was not aware that the wetlands had any
connection to other waters of the United States? What if the defendant was aware
that the wetlands were adjacent to a non-navigable stream, but the defendant did
not know that the stream had a “significant nexus” to a traditionally navigable water?

3.

Administrative orders and notice: The court notes that the defendants were
complying with an administrative order from the Corps for filling wetlands at the
same time that they continued to discharge fill material on other wetlands on the
property. One factor that may motivate the government to bring a criminal action is a
defendant’s violation of an administrative order. However, if the defendant in Wilson
was not violating the order, do you understand why the issuance of the order is
relevant to the question of whether the defendant was “knowingly” violating the
Clean Water Act?

4.

Standard of proof: Note that the district court required the government to prove
each element of the case beyond a reasonable doubt. In criminal prosecutions
under the Clean Water Act, all of the normal protections afforded to criminal
defendants apply.

5.

Other circuits: The Ninth Circuit interpreted the knowing requirement of the Clean
Water Act in a manner similar to the Wilson court in a case that did not involve
discharges into wetlands. See United States v. Weitzenhoff, 35 F.3d 1275 (9th Cir.
1994). The Second Circuit adopted a similar reading of the statute, in another case
that didn’t involve wetlands, but extended liability to persons who deliberately and
consciously avoided knowledge of the facts surrounding a violation. See United
States v. Hopkins, 53 F.3d 533 (2d Cir. 1995).

6.

Press coverage of criminal enforcement: While EPA limits criminal enforcement
actions and tries to select high profile cases that will deter violators, criminal
wetlands prosecutions can lead to bad press for EPA, regardless of the nature of the
defendant’s actions. For instance, in the early 1990s, EPA brought a criminal
prosecution against John Pozgai, a landowner who bought wetlands at a reduced
price, knowing that they were wetlands, and who filled 4 acres of wetlands with 400
truckloads of fill, flooding his neighbors properties, while ignoring cease and desist
361

letters from the Corps, as well as a temporary restraining order from federal district
court. See Royal C. Gardner, Mitigation in Wetlands Law and Policy: Understanding
Section 404 170 (American Bar Association, Section on Environment, Energy and
Resources 2005). Despite his conduct, the local press generally vilified the agency
as jackbooted thugs unfairly prosecuting a Hungarian immigrant and violating his
private property rights. Id.
7.

Public involvement in settlement of enforcement actions: When DOJ settles
environmental enforcement cases and prepares a consent decree, the Department
provides public notice of the consent decree and allows the public to comment on
the decree for 30 days. See 28 C.F.R. § 50.7. Among other places, the proposed
consent decrees are available on the website for the Environment and natural
Resources Division of the Department. See U.S. Department of Justice,
Environment and Natural Resources Division, Welcome to ENRD. Depending on
the comments, the Department may decide to withdraw from the settlement or
proceed to file the order with the court. Id.

Hypotheticals
1. Oliver Douglas recently purchased 100 acres of farmland in Springfield, Iowa from Virgil
Haney. Haney was aware that there were several prairie pothole wetlands on the property and
he did not farm on those sections of the property. However, he did not ever mention anything to
Douglas about the wetlands. Douglas moved to Iowa from New York City and was unfamiliar
with farming or prairie potholes. At the time that he bought the property, there was no water in
the potholes and they did not look like wetlands to Douglas’ untrained eye. Although the plants
that were growing in the wetlands were wetland plants, Douglas did not recognize them as such.
Similarly, he did not know that the water marks on a few trees near the wetlands were evidence
of periodic innundation of the area. Since his wife, Lisa, was not pleased with the size of the
small farmhouse on the property, Douglas hired a construction company to build an addition to
the house. When the construction company dug a new basement and foundation, Douglas
directed the company to dump the dirt from the construction into several depressional areas on
the property (the prairie potholes) to level them out. If EPA, upon learning about Douglas’
activities, brought a criminal action against Douglas for “knowingly” violating Section 301 of the
Clean Water Act, could he likely be held liable for criminal fines and imprisonment?
2. Assume that there was no continuous surface or groundwater connection between the prairie
potholes in question 1 and any other traditionally navigable water, but that the potholes provided
flood protection and filtered pollutants out of water that eventually flowed into the Springfield
River, a traditionally navigable water. In addition, many tourists visited Springfield each fall to
observe migratory birds that relied on the potholes in the region as temporary habitat during
their migration. If Douglas was aware that the potholes were wetlands, but was not aware of the
connections between the wetlands and the Springfield River or the migratory birds, and Douglas
directed the construction company to dump the dirt into the potholes, could he likely be held
criminally liable for “knowingly” violating Section 301 of the Clean Water Act?
3. Assume that Douglas was aware that the potholes were wetlands and a representative of the
Corps of Engineers visited his property while he was building the house and told him that he
could not dump the dirt from the construction into the wetlands. If Douglas’ attorney incorrectly
informed him that the fill was authorized by a general permit that the Corps had issued and
Douglas relied on that information, could he likely be held criminally liable for “knowingly”
violating Section 301 of the Clean Water Act?

363

Hypothetical
As outlined above, the Federal government has many enforcement options when a person fills
wetlands in violation of the Clean Water Act. The following hypothetical focuses on the choice of an
appropriate enforcement tool.
In March 2008, Wilbur Dunphy contacted the Corps of Engineers because he planned to purchase
property near Interstate 70 west of Columbia, Missouri to build a shopping center and he was
concerned that the construction might impact some wetlands on the property. Representatives of the
Corps visited the site and verbally told Dunphy that the wetlands on the property were not
connected, in any way, to jurisdictional waters, and were not “waters of the United States” that were
regulated under the Clean Water Act. Although there were many other parcels of land available that
did not have any wetlands on them, Dunphy preferred the parcel that the Corps examined because
it was located adjacent to an exit off the Interstate. If the wetlands on the parcel were “waters of the
United States,” it is unlikely that Dunphy would have been able to acquire a permit to authorize the
shopping center construction.
Based on the information that Dunphy received from the Corps, he bought the property and filled 50
acres of wetlands to build the shopping center. Six years later, a local citizens group complained to
EPA that the construction of the shopping center was contributing to pollution problems in the
nearby Missouri River, a traditionally navigable water. Although the wetlands that were filled did not
have a continuous surface connection to the Missouri River, a series of ditches, gullies, and
intermittent streams had connected the wetlands to the Missouri River. In fact, a few years before
Dunphy had contacted the Corps, and unbeknownst to the Corps, a Natural Resource Conservation
Service employee had examined the site and had collected data to demonstrate that the wetlands
decreased sedimentation, pollutants and flood waters to the Missouri River. Before the citizens
group contacted EPA, the agency was not aware that any filling activity had taken place on
Dunphy’s property. The citizens group believed that recent major floods near Columbia would not
have been as extreme if the wetlands had not been destroyed. The citizens group also believes that
the wetlands that were destroyed had provided habitat for several different species of endangered
amphibians, which were killed when the wetlands were converted.
At the same time that the citizens group complained to EPA about the filling activity, they
complained to the Corps. A representative of the Corps met with the citizens group and, after
reviewing the data collected by the Natural Resource Conservation Service employee, told the
members of the citizens group that it is often difficult, after the Rapanos decision, to demonstrate
that wetlands adjacent to non-navigable waters are “waters of the United States.” Nevertheless, the
representative of the Corps told the citizens group that she would explore enforcement options with
management at the District.
The shopping center is very profitable and is currently worth over $15 million. It is an economic hub
for the area and provides hundreds of jobs for local residents. It would be impossible to restore the
wetlands on the property at this time without tearing down major portions of the shopping center.
Which agency, if any, should pursue an enforcement action at this time? If the Corps or EPA pursue
an enforcement action, what relief should they seek? Should the agency pursue administrative
remedies, judicial civil remedies, or judicial criminal remedies? What are the advantages and
disadvantages of each option?

Resources for Sustainable Communities
authority serves multiple purposes. In some
cases, the threat of a citizen suit may spur
the government to take enforcement action.
In other cases, citizen suits fill the
enforcement gap when the government fails to take action against persons who violate the
Clean Water Act. The language of the citizen suit provision of the Clean Water Act is
reproduced below:

Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section * * * any citizen may commence
a civil action on his own behalf
(1) against any person (including (i) the United States, and (ii) any other
governmental instrumentality or agency to the extent permitted by the eleventh
amendment to the Constitution) who is alleged to be in violation of (A) an effluent
standard or limitation under this chapter or (B) an order issued by the Administrator
or a State with respect to such a standard or limitation, or
(2) against the Administrator where there is alleged a failure of the Administrator
to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary with the
Administrator
33 U.S.C. § 1365(a).
1.

Suits allowed

As is apparent from the language above, the statute authorizes citizen suits in two types of
situations: (1) suits against anyone who violates an effluent standard or limit or
administrative order regarding an effluent standard or limit; and (2) suits against EPA for
failing to perform a non-discretionary duty. As noted above, there are few mandatory
requirements for EPA in the Clean Water Act Section 404 program, so there are very few
citizen suits based on that authority. Most of the Clean Water Act wetlands citizen suits are
brought under Section 505(a)(1), 33 U.S.C. § 1365(a)(1), against persons who violate
effluent standards or limits or orders related to those standards or limits.
365

For purposes of the citizen suit provision, the Clean Water Act defines “effluent standard
or limitation” to include Section 401 certifications and actions that violate section 301(a) of
the Act, among other things. See 33 U.S.C. § 1365(f)(1),(5). Thus, citizens can sue any
persons who fill wetlands without a Section 404 permit, if one is required, since the
persons would be violating an effluent standard or limitation by violating Section 301(a).
While Section 505(a)(1) allows citizens to sue persons who fill wetlands without a permit,
it is not clear that the provision authorizes them to sue persons who have a Section 404
permit (including general permit) and who violate the terms or conditions of the permit.
The Clean Water Act explicitly defines “effluent standard or limitation” to include a Section
402 (NPDES) permit or conditions in a Section 402 permit, but it does not explicitly define
the term to include Section 404 permits, so some courts have held that citizens cannot
sue persons who violate the terms or conditions of a Section 404 permit. See Atchafalaya
Basinkeeper, et al. v. Chustz, 682 F.3d 356 (5th Cir. 2012); Northwest Environmental
Defense Center v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 118 F. Supp. 2d 1115 (D. Ore. 2000).
Since the statute limits citizen suits to situations where persons are alleged to be in
violation, citizens cannot sue persons who violated the Clean Water Act in the past, but
are no longer violating it at the time of the lawsuit. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v.
Chesapeake Bay Foundation, 484 U.S. 49, 64 (1987). The Supreme Court has interpreted
the “alleged to be in violation” language to limit citizen suit jurisdiction to cases where the
plaintiff can “make a good faith allegation of continuous or intermittent violation” of an
effluent standard or limit. Id. If the Clean Water Act violation challenged is not continuing or
reasonably likely to recur after the date that the lawsuit is filed, courts will dismiss the
citizen suit. Id. However, to the extent that litigants advance, and courts are willing to
embrace, the government’s theory that each day that fill material remains in place
constitutes a separate day of violation, plaintiffs should be able to avoid the Gwaltney limit
for cases where the illegal fill remains in place.
Section 505(a)(1) also clarifies that persons who can be sued for violating effluent
standards or limits include the United States, federal agencies, states and state agencies
(subject to limits imposed by the 11th Amendment). However, the remedies available in
those citizen suits are limited. Plaintiffs can only obtain injunctive relief and “coercive”
civil penalties (fines imposed to induce agencies to comply with injunctions or other
judicial orders designed to modify behavior prospectively) and not “punitive” civil penalties,
when suing the federal government for filling wetlands without a permit. See Department of
Energy v. Ohio, 503 U.S. 607 (1992) (interpreting the citizen suit provisions of the Clean
Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, but not involving Section 404
violations). Further, the 11th Amendment likely prevents plaintiffs from bringing citizen suits
against states to recover civil penalties, see Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996)
(finding that Congress can only abrogate state immunity if Congress unequivocally
expresses its intent to do so and acts pursuant to authority of the 14 th Amendment), but
plaintiffs can probably bring citizen suits against state officials for injunctive relief (i.e.
366

cessation of filling activities or restoration of wetlands) when a state or state agency is
illegally filling wetlands. See Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908); Natural Resources
Defense Council v. California Department of Transportation, 96 F.3d 420 (9th Cir. 1996).
2.

Jurisdiction, Venue and Relief available

The Clean Water Act authorizes citizens to file their lawsuits in federal district court. See 33
U.S.C. § 1365(a). When the plaintiff is alleging that the defendant is violating an effluent
standard or limitation or an order regarding an effluent standard or limitation, the plaintiff
must bring the suit in the district in which the source of the violation is located. Id. §
1365(c). The district courts can order persons violating effluent standards, limits, or orders
to comply with those requirements and can order the Administrator to perform nondiscretionary duties. Id. § 1365(a). In addition, the court can impose civil penalties on the
defendant (subject to the limits discussed above for federal and state defendants). Id. As
with government enforcement, though, the civil penalties are paid into the general fund of
the United States Treasury and are not paid to the plaintiffs. The statute does not authorize
the court to award any damages to plaintiffs, and there is no implied right of action for
damages, so plaintiffs must rely on common law theories to recover any compensation for
personal injury, property damage or similar injuries. See Middlesex County Sewerage
Authority v. National Sea Clammers Association, 453 U.S. 1 (1981).
The statute also authorizes the court to award litigation costs, including reasonable
attorneys fees and expert witness fees, to any prevailing or substantially prevailing
party whenever the court determines an award is appropriate. Id. § 1365(d). In order to be
a prevailing or substantially prevailing party, the party seeking costs must have succeeded
on a significant issue in the litigation. See Public Interest Research Group of New Jersey,
Inc. v. Windall, 51 F.3d 1179 (3d Cir. 1995) (Clean Water Act case that didn’t involve
wetlands). Prior to 2001, many courts held that a plaintiff could recover attorneys fees as a
prevailing party when their lawsuit acted as a catalyst for a voluntary change in the
defendant’s conduct that achieved the outcome that the plaintiff desired to achieve in
bringing the citizen suit. However, in Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West
Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598 (2001), a case
involving the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act, the
Supreme Court held that a party must secure a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered
consent decree, which can include a consent decree that enforces a settlement agreement,
to recover attorneys’ fees as a prevailing party.

Limits on citizen suits
Standing

Section 505(a) of the Clean Water Act authorizes any citizen to bring a citizen suit, and the
statute defines a citizen as “a person or persons having an interest which is or maybe
adversely affected.” See 33 U.S.C. § 1365(g). While the statute authorizes a broad
category of persons to sue, Congress cannot eliminate Article III standing requirements
through legislation, so plaintiffs must still demonstrate that they have suffered or imminently
will suffer an injury that was caused by the Clean Water Act violation about which they are
suing and that the relief that they are seeking in the citizen suit (injunction, damages, etc.)
will redress their injury. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services,
528 U.S. 167, 181-183 (2000) (noting that aesthetic injuries suffered by the plaintiff can
suffice, as can injuries suffered by the plaintiff that are caused by the plaintiff’s reasonable
concerns that the defendant’s conduct will cause harm). Depending on the facts of the
case, a plaintiff may have a difficult time demonstrating that they have already been injured
by the defendant’s conduct or that they will imminently be injured by the conduct, or that an
injunction or civil penalties will redress their injuries.
As noted above, in order to demonstrate standing, plaintiffs normally also must show that
their interest in the litigation is arguably within the zone of interests sought to be protected
by the statute under which they are suing. However, this prudential standing requirement
is less problematic for plaintiffs in the Clean Water Act context than the Article III standing
(injury in fact) requirement. It is less problematic because it is an easy test to meet in most
cases. In Clarke v. Securities Industry Association, 479 U.S. 388, 399-400 (1987), the
Supreme Court held that standing will be denied under that test only if the plaintiff’s
interests are “so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the
statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.” In
Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997), the Supreme Court clarified that, in determining
whether the zone of interests test is met, the court examines the purpose of the section of
the statute under which the plaintiff is suing, rather than the general purposes of the
statute. Thus, in a citizen suit alleging violations of Section 404, the plaintiff would have to
demonstrate that their interests not simply marginally related to or inconsistent with the
purposes of Section 404. When citizens are alleging environmental injuries caused by the
defendant’s Section 404 violation, it is not difficult to demonstrate that the injuries are within
the zone of interests sought to be protected by Section 404. However, if the plaintiffs are
competitors of the defendants and are alleging that they have suffered economic harm
caused by the violation, it may be more difficult to satisfy the zone of interest test.
It is likely, though, that the zone of interests test will not serve as a roadblock to citizen suits
in any case because it probably does not apply at all in the Clean Water Act citizen suit
context. Although Congress cannot eliminate Article III standing requirements through
legislation, the Supreme Court held, in Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997), that
368

Congress eliminated the “zone of interest” requirement for citizen suits under the
Endangered Species Act when it enacted a broadly worded citizen suit provision that
authorized any person to sue for violations of the statute. Since Section 505 also broadly
authorizes any citizen to sue, there is a strong argument available to plaintiffs that
Congress eliminated the zone of interest requirement for citizen suits under the Clean
Water Act, as well. However, in finding that the language of the Endangered Species Act
citizen suit provision was broad enough to demonstrate Congress’ intent to eliminate the
“zone of interest” requirement for that statute, the Supreme Court pointed out that the
language was broader than the language used in other environmental statutes, specifically
contrasting the language of Section 505 of the Clean Water Act. Thus, it is possible that
Clean Water Act citizen suit plaintiffs may still need to satisfy the zone of interest test.
Notice and Diligent Prosecution Bar
As noted above, citizen enforcement is designed to supplement, rather than replace,
government enforcement. Consequently, before a plaintiff can file a citizen suit, they must
provide, to the defendant, EPA, and the state where the violation is occurring, a notice of
their intent to sue at least 60 days before filing suit. See 33 U.S.C. § 1365(b). If they are
suing EPA for failure to perform a non-discretionary duty, they must provide EPA with
notice of their intent to sue at least 60 days before filing suit. Id. EPA has adopted
regulations that further specify the content of the required notice, the manner in which it
must be served, and the persons to whom it must be directed. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 135.1 135.3. If a plaintiff files their citizen suit without filing the required 60 day notice, the court
will dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction. See Hallstrom v. Tillamook County, 493 U.S. 20,
26 (1989) (interpreting similar language in RCRA).
If a citizen files their notice of intent to sue a defendant for violating an effluent standard or
limitation or order regarding an effluent standard or limitation, and EPA or the state
commence and are diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal action in state or federal
court to enforce the standard, limitation or order before the plaintiff files a citizen suit,
the plaintiff is precluded from filing suit. See 33 U.S.C. § 1365(b). That limit is consistent
with the goal of the statute to establish the government as the primary enforcement
authority. The Clean Water Act also prohibits citizen suits when the Corps, EPA or States
are diligently prosecuting administrative penalty proceedings.” See 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(6).
While courts are reluctant to find that the government is not diligently prosecuting a
lawsuit if the government has commenced the lawsuit in court, there are cases where a
plaintiff can prove lack of diligent prosecution. For instance, a Clean Water Act case that
didn’t involve wetlands or Section 404 reached the Supreme Court when the district court
allowed the citizen suit to go forward, finding that a state enforcement action was not being
diligently prosecuted because the defendant drafted the complaint against itself, drafted the
settlement agreement, filed the lawsuit against itself and paid the filing fee, and because
the agreement was entered into with “unusual haste” and provided for civil penalties that
were less than the economic benefit that the defendant received by violating the Clean
369

Water Act. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, 528 U.S. 167
(2000). The Laidlaw case is unusual, though, and judicial enforcement actions by
government usually will preclude citizen suits. If the plaintiff cannot bring a citizen suit
because the government is diligently prosecuting an enforcement action, the statute
authorizes the citizen to intervene as of right in enforcement actions brought in federal
court. See 33 U.S.C. § 1365(b).
While the statute bars citizen suits when the government is diligently prosecuting an
enforcement action, if a plaintiff files a notice of intent to sue in accordance with the statute
and neither the state nor the federal government commence a judicial enforcement action,
the plaintiff can file its citizen suit and can proceed with the suit even if the state or federal
government bring an enforcement action after the plaintiff files the citizen suit. The bar on
citizen suits in Section 505 only applies when the government brings enforcement actions
before the plaintiff files suit. When the plaintiff brings a citizen suit, though, the Clean Water
Act requires the plaintiff to serve a copy of the complaint on the Attorney General and EPA
and authorizes EPA to intervene in the citizen suit as of right. See 33 U.S.C. § 1365(c). In
addition, the statute prohibits the court from entering a consent judgment in a citizen suit if
the United States isn’t a party to the suit until 45 days after the Attorney General and EPA
receive a copy of the proposed consent judgment. Id. EPA’s regulations provide more detail
regarding the manner of service of the complaint and consent judgment. See 40 C.F.R. §§
135.4 - 135.5.

Hypotheticals
The Griffin Heavy Equipment Company, which manufactures construction vehicles, recently broke
ground on a new factory in the suburbs of Seattle, Washington. Flanders Construction Company,
a competitor of Griffin, has most of its manufacturing facilities on the east coast, but hoped to open
a factory on the west coast and was in negotiations to acquire the property which Griffin eventually
acquired. The city provided Griffin with significant tax incentives and Flanders has not been able to
find another suitable location in the state of Washington.
While driving by the Griffin property in April of last year, Ed Flanders, the CEO of Flanders
Construction Company, noticed that Griffin was filling 20 acres of wetlands on the property to build
the factory. Ed Flanders was still upset that Griffin acquired the property that he wanted to acquire
for his factory, so he consulted his corporate counsel to see whether he could do anything to
“make life difficult” for Griffin.
After speaking to his attorney and learning that Griffin did not have a permit authorizing the filling
activity, Flanders sent a letter to the Griffin Heavy Equipment Company, copying EPA and the
Washington State Department of Ecology, indicating that Flanders intended to sue Griffin under
Section 505(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, because Griffin was violating Section 301 of the Clean
Water Act by discharging fill material into navigable waters without a permit.
A week later, Griffin completed the filling of wetlands and poured the concrete pad for the factory.
Flanders waited another 3 months before taking any other action. Griffin did not engage in any
additional filling activities during that time and neither EPA nor the State of Washington took any
administrative, civil or criminal action against Griffin. Three and a half months after sending the
letter to Griffin threatening a lawsuit, Flanders filed a citizen suit against Griffin under Section
505(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of
Washington, located in Spokane, Washington. Flanders felt that the judges in that court would be
more sympathetic to his case than the judges in the Western District, where the property was
located.
In his complaint, Flanders alleged that he had an economic interest in bringing suit and would be
injured, as a competitor, because Griffin was able to lower its operating costs by building a factory
without complying with the Clean Water Act. Flanders did not allege any interest in clean water or
the environment in his complaint. What defenses could Griffin raise in response to the complaint?
With what success? If EPA brought an enforcement action under Section 309 after Flanders sued,
and EPA sought civil penalties, but did not seek restoration of the wetlands, could Flanders
proceed with his suit?

Drafting Exercise
You have been retained by Friends of the Ocmulgee (“Friends”), a non-profit organization, to file
a citizen suit against Middle Georgia River Runners, Inc. (“MGRRI”), because MGRRI allegedly
discharged dredged or fill material into navigable waters without a Clean Water Act Section 404
permit. Friends was incorporated in Georgia and has its headquarters at 12345 Sixth Street,
Macon, Georgia, 31207. Their phone number is (478) 987-6543. MGRRI is a corporation that
was incorporated in Georgia, has its headquarters on River Road in Juliette, Georgia, 31046,
and is doing business in Georgia.
Friends was created to protect and advocate for the water quality of the Ocmulgee River and
the recreational use and enjoyment of the River. Friends has numerous members in Macon,
Juliette, and Middle Georgia who live, work or travel along the Ocmulgee River and recreate
in or near the River (by fishing, hiking, walking, photographing, plant gathering and boating).
MGRRI operates a rafting tour business from its property on River Road, which is adjacent to
the Ocmulgee River. On October 10, 2014, members of Friends observed employees of
MGRRI using a Caterpillar Backhoe Loader to clear ½ acre of wetlands adjacent to the
Ocmulgee River on the River Road property. On the same day, they observed those
employees using the Backhoe Loader to add rock and soil to the wetlands to construct a
parking lot for the rafting tour business. For purposes of this exercise, assume that the
Ocmulgee River is a tributary of an interstate water. MGRRI did not have a Section 404
permit that authorized the clearing or filling of the wetlands. The fill material remains in place
today.
The recreational, economic, aesthetic and/or health interests of Friends and its members
have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by MGRRI’s violations of the Clean
Water Act. The relief sought in the lawsuit will redress the injuries to those interests.
Friends would like to bring a citizen suit against MGRRI under the Clean Water Act for a
declaratory judgment that MGRRI is violating the Act, an injunction to require MGRRI to
remediate the harm caused by the violation, imposition of civil penalties, an award of costs,
including attorneys’ fees and expert witness fees, and other appropriate relief.
1. Draft the 60 day notice required by the Clean Water Act. EPA’s regulations regarding the
notice requirements are codified at 40 C.F.R. §§ 135.1 - 135.3. The materials included in the
“Resources” box at the beginning of the section of this Chapter that addresses “Citizen Suits”
should also be helpful in drafting the notice.
2. Draft the complaint for the citizen suit. The materials included in the “Resources” box,
referenced in the last question, should be helpful in drafting the notice. For purposes of this
exercise, you do not need to conform the pleading to the local rules of the federal district court
in which you will file the complaint. Remember to include the 60 day notice that you prepared
in response to the last question as an attachment.

Chapter 11
Regulatory Takings
I. Background
From the early days of the Clean Water Act Section 404 program through today, private
property rights advocates have criticized government regulation of wetlands. Although the
Corps denies very few Section 404 permit applications, over the years, several landowners
have challenged wetland permit denials as “takings” of their property. In light of the fact that
almost 75% of the remaining wetlands in the lower 48 states are privately owned, the
takings issue is likely to remain an important consideration in the design and
implementation of wetlands protection programs.
To the extent that “takings” claims arise regarding federal or state wetlands regulation, the
claims usually arise when the government
denies a permit to a landowner that would
authorize development in wetlands, although
some landowners have raised takings claims
as soon as the government has asserted
jurisdiction over wetlands on their property.
Landowners have also raised takings
challenges when the government issues a
permit, but includes conditions or limits in the
permit that the landowners oppose.
Takings claims are based on the Fifth
Amendment of the United States Constitution,
which provides that private property shall not
be “taken for public use, without just
compensation.” See U.S. Const., Amend. 5. Photo 35 By Ian Paterson
While the Fifth Amendment provides the basis http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3APriv
for takings claims against the Corps of ate_Property_-_geograph.org.uk_-_838016.jpg
[CC-BY-SA-2.0]
Engineers and other federal agencies, the
takings prohibition is also made applicable to states and state agencies through the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. See Chicago, B. & Q. R.
Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226 (1897).

374

Although early court decisions focused on physical invasion or appropriation of property by
government as takings, the Supreme Court has held, since 1922, that government
regulation of property that restricts the use of the property can constitute a taking if the
regulation “goes too far.” See Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922). At the
same time, though, Justice Holmes, writing for the Court, stressed that “[g]overnment
hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished
without paying for every such change in the general law.” Id. at 413.
Fifty years later, the Court provided some guidance to help determine when government
regulation “goes too far,” so that is a taking. In Penn Central Transportation Company v.
New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978), the Court eschewed adopting any bright line
rules, but held that several factors are significant in evaluating whether government
regulation constitutes a taking, including (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the
claimant; (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with investment-backed
expectations of the claimant; and (3) the character of the government action. Regarding
the character of the government action, the Court suggested that it was less likely that
government regulation would be a taking when the interference with private property rights
“arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to
promote the common good.” Id. According to the Court, the three factor Penn Central test
requires an ad hoc, factual analysis in each case. Id. The Penn Central Court again
stressed that the government is not required to pay for every reduction in property value
caused by regulation, but is only required to pay when the regulation “goes too far.” Id. In
Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394 (1915), a case cited by the Penn Central Court, the
Supreme Court upheld a law prohibiting the operation of a brickyard in a residential
neighborhood against a taking challenge even though the regulation reduced the
landowner’s property value by more than 90%.
II.

Jurisdiction and Timing of Takings Claims

According to the Tucker Act, takings claims against the United States must be brought in
the United States Court of Federal Claims if the plaintiff is seeking more than $10,000. See
28 U.S.C. § 1491. Takings claims for less than $10,000 can be brought in the federal
district courts. See 28 U.S.C. § 1346. The Court of Federal Claims does not have
jurisdiction to adjudicate the validity of the Corps’ denial or issuance of a Section 404
permit, an EPA veto of a permit, or a jurisdictional determination by EPA or the Corps, so a
landowner who is seeking more than $10,000 in compensation for a taking based on those
actions must bring two separate actions if they want to challenge the validity of the
underlying agency determination that is allegedly a taking. Decisions of the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims can be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. Consequently, most of the takings jurisprudence developed outside of the Supreme
Court is developed in the Court of Federal Claims and the Federal Circuit.
Since a court determining whether a government regulation constitutes a taking must
375

conduct an ad hoc factual analysis of the impact of the government regulation on the
property, the Supreme Court has stressed that a takings claim “is not ripe until the
government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision
regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.” See Williamson
County Regional Planning v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172 (1985). In that case, the Court
held that a developer could not challenge, as a taking, a county planning commission’s
decision to deny approval for a development proposal because the developer had not yet
sought a variance that might have allowed the development to proceed. In the following
year, in McDonald et al v. County of Yolo, 477 U.S. 340, 351 (1986), the Court again
stressed that a landowner cannot pursue a takings challenge based on the application of a
government regulatory program to its land until the landowner receives the government’s
“final, definitive position regarding how it will apply the regulations at issue to the particular
land in question.” In McDonald, the Court determined that, even though the government
had denied the landowner’s subdivision proposal, it was possible that the government
would approve a more limited subdivision proposal if the landowner sought approval, so the
Court could not determine the extent of the government interference with the landowner’s
property rights until the government identified a final, definitive position on the limits on the
development of the property. Id.
There are, however, limits to this line of authority. In Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S.
606, 620 (2001), the Supreme Court held that “once it becomes clear that the agency lacks
the discretion to permit any development, or the permissible uses of the property are known
to a reasonable degree of certainty, a takings claim is likely to have ripened.” In that case,
the government argued that the plaintiff’s takings challenge to regulation limiting the
development of wetlands was unripe because the plaintiff had not submitted additional
development proposals after three development proposals were rejected, but the Court
concluded that the plaintiff could pursue a takings claim because it was clear that the
government would not allow any development of the wetlands even if the plaintiff submitted
another development proposal. Id. Thus, if the limits that the government will ultimately
place on a landowner’s property can be determined to a reasonable degree of certainty, the
landowner’s taking claim will be ripe and they do not have to pursue variance procedures or
advance other development proposals that would be futile.
In light of ripeness concerns like those in the Williamson County and McDonald cases,
landowners are generally unable to bring takings challenges based on a preliminary or
approved jurisdictional determination by the Corps or EPA. See United States v. Riverside
Bayview Homes, 474 U.S. 121 (1985). Since a landowner might still be able to obtain a
Section 404 permit to develop their property after the government has determined that the
property contains jurisdictional waters, it is not clear, at the time of the jurisdictional
determination, what restrictions, if any, will be placed on the landowner’s use of their
property. Similarly, a landowner will generally not be able to challenge a cease and desist
order or administrative compliance order as a taking, since the landowner may ultimately be
able to engage in the prohibited development of their property if they seek and obtain a
376

Section 404 permit. See Tabb Lakes, Ltd. v. United States, 10 F.3d 796 (Fed. Cir. 1993).
For the same reasons, when the government determines that an activity is not exempt from
the Section 404 permit requirement or that an activity is not authorized by a general permit,
a landowner will generally be unable to challenge the government decision as a taking
because the landowner may still apply for, and perhaps obtain, an individual Section 404
permit. In each of the preceding scenarios in this paragraph, though, if it is clear that any
application for a Section 404 permit would be ultimately rejected, a landowner may be able
to argue their takings challenge is ripe in light of the Palazzolo decision.
Once landowners apply for a permit and the Corps or EPA (though a veto) make a final
decision on the permit, it becomes easier for landowners to raise takings challenges,
although some of those decisions may still not be ripe for a takings challenge. If the Corps
has issued a Section 404 permit to a landowner and the landowner wants to challenge the
restrictions placed on his property by the conditions included in the permit, the landowner’s
claim is probably ripe for review, since the permit reflects the government’s final definitive
application of the Clean Water Act regulatory program to the landowner’s property.
If, however, a Section 404 permit application is withdrawn or denied “without prejudice”
because the applicant did not provide all of the information required to process the permit
application or because the applicant was not able to obtain the necessary state or local
approvals for the development project (i.e. State permit, 401 certification, CZMA
consistency, local zoning approval, etc.), the landowner will probably not be able to pursue
a takings claim against the Corps at that time. See Heck v. United States, 37 Fed. Cl. 245
(1997). After all, it is not clear, at that time, whether the Corps would have issued a permit
or included specific conditions in the permit if the applicant had obtained the other
necessary approvals. If the Corps, in denying the permit “without prejudice”, indicates that it
would have denied the permit anyway, though, a court may determine that a takings claim
against the agency is ripe. See City National Bank v. United States, 33 Fed. Cl. 224 (1995).
When the Corps denies a permit and does not deny it “without prejudice”, landowners are
in the best position to pursue a ripe takings challenge. Although the Corps might argue that
the landowner must re-submit a less ambitious permit application before challenging the
denial as a taking, in light of the Williamson County and McDonald precedent, the Court of
Federal Claims frequently rejects that argument, finding that additional permit applications
would be futile. See, e.g., Cristina Inv. Corp. v. United States, 40 Fed. Cl. 571 (1998); City
National Bank v. United States, 30 Fed. Cl. 715 (1994).

377

Questions and Comments
1.

Ripeness and Appeals: Pursuant to the Corps’ regulations, permits denied with
prejudice and declined permits can be appealed administratively and cannot be
challenged in court if they are not challenged administratively. See 33 C.F.R. §
331.12. In light of those regulations, it is unclear whether the Court of Federal
Claims will allow a landowner to pursue a takings challenge to a permit denial or
permit conditions if the landowner has not exhausted its administrative remedies. If
the landowner has sought administrative review, though, the Court of Federal
Claims will not review a takings claim until the Corps has made a final decision on
the appeal. See Bay-Houston Towing Co. v. United States, 58 Fed. Cl. 462 (2003).

2.

Swampbuster: Landowners have not generally brought takings claims based on a
denial of farm benefits due to the Swampbuster provisions of the Food Security Act.
Do you understand why not?

3.

State Laws Providing Compensation for Diminution in Value: Although the
Supreme Court has held that the government is not required to pay for every
reduction in property value, but is only required to compensate landowners when
government regulation “goes too far,” many states have passed laws that require
government entities to compensate landowners when government regulation
reduces property values by a specific degree (i.e., 50%, 70%, etc.) See
Environmental Law Institute, State Constraints: State-Imposed Limitations on the
Authority of Agencies to Regulate Waters Beyond the Scope of the Federal Clean
Water Act 20-23 (May 2013). The laws are not based on the federal or state
constitutions, but create additional limits on government regulation to protect “private
property rights.” Many of the laws allow states to avoid paying compensation by
waiving the application of the regulation to the landowner challenging the
government action. Id. What impact might these laws have on federal or state
regulation of wetlands?

378

Hypotheticals
1. Alex Pritchett owns an acre of land in Glynn County, Georgia. She would like to build a dock
on the property, which is primarily coastal wetlands, but the Corps of Engineers has just issued
an approved jurisdictional determination, finding that the entire parcel of land is “waters of the
United States.” Without focusing on whether the Corps’ action ultimately would be a taking, can
she bring a taking action in federal district court seeking $8,000 in damages (the amount that she
paid for the property) based on the Corps’ jurisdictional determination? If the Corps subsequently
informs her that her plans to build her dock on the property do not qualify for the regional general
permit that the Corps district issued to authorize the construction of small docks, can she bring
her takings lawsuit at that time? Would it make a difference if the Corps simultaneously told her
that she would never be able to build a dock on her property because any construction on her
property would harm a sensitive breeding area for several species of snakes and rodents?
2. Arthur Gomez applied to the Corps of Engineers for a Section 404 permit to fill 7 acres of
wetlands on a 10 acre plot of land that he owned, so that he could develop the property as a
residential subdivision. When the State would not provide a Section 401 certification for his
proposed development, the Corps denied his permit without prejudice, although they encouraged
him to submit a new application that would impact fewer acres of wetlands because they would
never approve a proposal to fill all 7 acres of wetlands on his property. Without focusing on
whether the Corps’ action would ultimately be a taking, can he bring a taking action in federal
district court seeking $500,000 (the amount that he paid for the property)? Would your answer be
different if the State provided the Section 401 certification but the Corps denied the permit
application after the agency asked Gomez to submit a development proposal that would impact 5
acres or less of wetlands on the property and Gomez refused? Should Gomez appeal the permit
denial administratively before bringing his takings claim?

III.

The Takings Analysis

In determining whether government regulation constitutes a taking, courts generally engage
in an ad hoc, fact-sensitive analysis using the Penn Central analysis. However, the
Supreme Court has established a few categorical rules that apply in takings cases. The
following case examines one of those rules. As additional background for the case, it is
helpful for the reader to know that, prior to this case, the Supreme Court held that a
landowner can recover compensation when a government regulation “temporarily” takes
their property, even though the regulatory restriction is later removed. See Tahoe Sierra
Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302 (2002); First
English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304
(1987).

JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of

In 1986, petitioner David H. Lucas paid $975,000 for two residential lots on the Isle of
Palms in Charleston County, South Carolina, on which he intended to build single-family
homes. In 1988, however, the South Carolina Legislature enacted the Beachfront
Management Act, * * * which had the direct effect of barring petitioner from erecting any
permanent habitable structures on his two parcels. * * * A state trial court found that this
prohibition rendered Lucas's parcels "valueless." * * * This case requires us to decide
whether the Act's dramatic effect on the economic value of Lucas's lots accomplished a
taking of private property under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments requiring the
payment of "just compensation." U.S. Const., Amend. 5.

A
South Carolina's expressed interest in intensively managing development activities in the
so-called "coastal zone" dates from 1977 when, in the aftermath of Congress's passage of
380

the federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, * * * the legislature enacted a Coastal
Zone Management Act of its own. * * * In its original form, the South Carolina Act required
owners of coastal zone land that qualified as a "critical area" (defined in the legislation to
include beaches and immediately adjacent sand dunes, * * * to obtain a permit from the
newly created South Carolina Coastal Council (Council) (respondent here) prior to
committing the land to a "use other than the use the critical area was devoted to on
[September 28, 1977]." * * *
In the late 1970's, Lucas and others began extensive residential development of the Isle of
Palms, a barrier island situated eastward of the city of Charleston. Toward the close of the
development cycle for one residential subdivision known as "Beachwood East," Lucas in
1986 purchased the two lots at issue in this litigation for his own account. No portion of the
lots, which were located approximately 300 feet from the beach, qualified as a "critical area"
under the 1977 Act; accordingly, at the time Lucas acquired these parcels, he was not
legally obliged to obtain a permit from the Council in advance of any development activity.
His intention with respect to the lots was to do what the owners of the immediately adjacent
parcels had already done: erect singlefamily residences. He commissioned architectural
drawings for this purpose.
The Beachfront Management Act brought Lucas's plans to an abrupt end. Under that 1988
legislation, the Council was directed to establish a "baseline" connecting the landwardmost
"point[s] of erosion ... during the past forty years" in the region of the Isle of Palms that
includes Lucas's lots. * * * In action not challenged here, the Council fixed this baseline
landward of Lucas's parcels. That was significant, for under the Act construction of
occupable improvements2 was flatly prohibited seaward of a line drawn 20 feet landward of,
and parallel to, the baseline. * * * The Act provided no exceptions.
B
Lucas promptly filed suit in the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas, contending that the
Beachfront Management Act's construction bar effected a taking of his property without just
compensation. Lucas did not take issue with the validity of the Act as a lawful exercise of
South Carolina's police power, but contended that the Act's complete extinguishment of his
property's value entitled him to compensation regardless of whether the legislature had
acted in furtherance of legitimate police power objectives. Following a bench trial, the court
agreed. Among its factual determinations was the finding that "at the time Lucas purchased
the two lots, both were zoned for single-family residential construction and ... there were no
restrictions imposed upon such use of the property by either the State of South Carolina,
2

The Act did allow the construction of certain nonhabitable improvements, e. g., "wooden
walkways no larger in width than six feet," and "small wooden decks no larger than one
hundred forty-four square feet."
381

the County of Charleston, or the Town of the Isle of Palms." * * * The trial court further
found that the Beachfront Management Act decreed a permanent ban on construction
insofar as Lucas's lots were concerned, and that this prohibition "deprive[d] Lucas of any
reasonable economic use of the lots, ... eliminated the unrestricted right of use, and
render[ed] them valueless." * * * The court thus concluded that Lucas's properties had
been "taken" by operation of the Act, and it ordered respondent to pay "just compensation"
in the amount of $1,232,387.50. * * *
The Supreme Court of South Carolina reversed. It found dispositive what it described as
Lucas's concession "that the Beachfront Management Act [was] properly and validly
designed to preserve ... South Carolina's beaches." * * * Failing an attack on the validity of
the statute as such, the court believed itself bound to accept the "uncontested ... findings"
of the South Carolina Legislature that new construction in the coastal zone-such as
petitioner intended-threatened this public resource. * * * The court ruled that when a
regulation respecting the use of property is designed "to prevent serious public harm," * * *
(citing, inter alia, Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887)), no compensation is owing under
the Takings Clause regardless of the regulation's effect on the property's value.
Two justices dissented. They acknowledged that our Mugler line of cases recognizes
governmental power to prohibit "noxious" uses of property-i. e., uses of property akin to
"public nuisances"-without having to pay compensation. But they would not have
characterized the Beachfront Management Act's "primary purpose [as] the prevention of a
nuisance." * * * To the dissenters, the chief purposes of the legislation, among them the
promotion of tourism and the creation of a "habitat for indigenous flora and fauna," could
not fairly be compared to nuisance abatement. * * * As a consequence, they would have
affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the Act's obliteration of the value of petitioner's lots
accomplished a taking.
We granted certiorari. * * *
III
Prior to Justice Holmes's exposition in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393
(1922), it was generally thought that the Takings Clause reached only a "direct
appropriation" of property * * * or the functional equivalent of a "practical ouster of [the
owner's] possession," * * * Justice Holmes recognized in Mahon, however, that if the
protection against physical appropriations of private property was to be meaningfully
enforced, the government's power to redefine the range of interests included in the
ownership of property was necessarily constrained by constitutional limits. 260 U.S., at 414415. * * *
Nevertheless, our decision in Mahon offered little insight into when, and under what
circumstances, a given regulation would be seen as going "too far" for purposes of the Fifth
382

Amendment. In 70-odd years of succeeding "regulatory takings" jurisprudence, we have
generally eschewed any "'set formula' " for determining how far is too far, preferring to
"engag[e] in ... essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries." Penn Central Transportation Co. v.
New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978) (quoting Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S.
590,594 (1962)). * * * We have, however, described at least two discrete categories of
regulatory action as compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest
advanced in support of the restraint. The first encompasses regulations that compel the
property owner to suffer a physical "invasion" of his property. * * *
The second situation in which we have found categorical treatment appropriate is where
regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land. See Agins v. City of
Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260; see also Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825,
834 (1987); Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 495 (1987);
Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 [*1016] U.S. 264, 295-296
(1981). * * * As we have said on numerous occasions, the Fifth Amendment is violated
when land-use regulation "does not substantially advance legitimate state interests or
denies an owner economically viable use of his land." Agins, supra, at 260 (citations
omitted) (emphasis added).7
7

Regrettably, the rhetorical force of our "deprivation of all economically feasible use" rule is
greater than its precision, since the rule does not make clear the "property interest" against
which the loss of value is to be measured. When, for example, a regulation requires a
developer to leave 90% of a rural tract in its natural state, it is unclear whether we would
analyze the situation as one in which the owner has been deprived of all economically
beneficial use of the burdened portion of the tract, or as one in which the owner has
suffered a mere diminution in value of the tract as a whole. (For an extreme-and, we think,
unsupportable-view of the relevant calculus, see Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New
York City, 42 N.Y.2d 324, 333-334, 366 N.E.2d 1271, 1276-1277 (1977), aff'd, 438 U.S.
104 (1978), where the state court examined the diminution in a particular parcel's value
produced by a municipal ordinance in light of total value of the takings claimant's other
holdings in the vicinity.) Unsurprisingly, this uncertainty regarding the composition of the
denominator in our "deprivation" fraction has produced inconsistent pronouncements by the
Court. Compare Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 414 (1922) (law restricting
subsurface extraction of coal held to effect a taking), with Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn.
v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 497-502 (1987) (nearly identical law held not to effect a
taking); see also id., at 515-520 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting); * * * The answer to this
difficult question may lie in how the owner's reasonable expectations have been shaped by
the State's law of property-i. e., whether and to what degree the State's law has accorded
legal recognition and protection to the particular interest in land with respect to which the
takings claimant alleges a diminution in (or elimination of) value. In any event, we avoid this
difficulty in the present case, since the "interest in land" that Lucas has pleaded (a fee
simple interest) is an estate with a rich tradition of protection at common law, and since the
South Carolina Court of Common Pleas found that the Beachfront Management Act left
383

We have never set forth the justification for this rule. Perhaps it is simply, as Justice
Brennan suggested, that total deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner's point of
view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation. See San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. San
Diego, 450 U.S., at 652 (dissenting opinion). "[F]or what is the land but the profits
thereof[?]" 1 E. Coke, Institutes, ch. 1, § 1 (1st Am. ed. 1812). Surely, at least, in the
extraordinary circumstance when no productive or economically beneficial use of land is
permitted, it is less realistic to indulge our usual assumption that the legislature is simply
"adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life," Penn Central Transportation Co., 438
U.S., at 124, in a manner that secures an "average reciprocity of advantage" to everyone
concerned, Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at 415. And the functional basis for
permitting the government, by regulation, to affect property values without compensationthat
"Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could
not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law,"
id., at 413 - does not apply to the relatively rare situations where the government has
deprived a landowner of all economically beneficial uses.
On the other side of the balance, affirmatively supporting a compensation requirement, is
the fact that regulations that leave the owner of land without economically beneficial or
productive options for its use-typically, as here, by requiring land to be left substantially in
its natural state-carry with them a heightened risk that private property is being pressed into
some form of public service under the guise of mitigating serious public harm. See, e. g.,
Annicelli v. South Kingstown, 463 A.2d 133, 140-141 (R.I. 1983) (prohibition on
construction adjacent to beach justified on twin grounds of safety and "conservation of open
space"); Morris County Land Improvement Co. v. Parsippany-Troy Hills Township, 40 N.J.
539, 552-553, 193 A.2d 232, 240 (1963) (prohibition on filling marshlands imposed in order
to preserve region as water detention basin and create wildlife refuge). As Justice Brennan
explained:
"From the government's point of view, the benefits flowing to the public from
preservation of open space through regulation may be equally great as from
creating a wildlife refuge through formal condemnation or increasing electricity
production through a dam project that floods private property."
San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., supra, at 652 (dissenting opinion). The many statutes on the
books, both state and federal, that provide for the use of eminent domain to impose
servitudes on private scenic lands preventing developmental uses, or to acquire such lands
each of Lucas's beachfront lots without economic value.
384

altogether, suggest the practical equivalence in this setting of negative regulation and
appropriation. * * *
We think, in short, that there are good reasons for our frequently expressed belief that
when the owner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice all economically
beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically
idle, he has suffered a taking.8

8

JUSTICE STEVENS criticizes the "deprivation of all economically beneficial use" rule as
"wholly arbitrary," in that "[the] landowner whose property is diminished in value 95%
recovers nothing," while the landowner who suffers a complete elimination of value
"recovers the land's full value." Post, at 1064. This analysis errs in its assumption that the
landowner whose deprivation is one step short of complete is not entitled to compensation.
Such an owner might not be able to claim the benefit of our categorical formulation, but, as
we have acknowledged time and again, "[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the
claimant and ... the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investmentbacked expectations" are keenly relevant to takings analysis generally. Penn Central
Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978). It is true that in at least
some cases the landowner with 95% loss will get nothing, while the landowner with total
loss will recover in full. But that occasional result is no more strange than the gross
disparity between the landowner whose premises are taken for a highway (who recovers in
full) and the landowner whose property is reduced to 5% of its former value by the highway
(who recovers nothing). Takings law is full of these "all or-nothing" situations.
JUSTICE STEVENS similarly misinterprets our focus on "developmental" uses of property
(the uses proscribed by the Beachfront Management Act) as betraying an "assumption that
the only uses of property cognizable under the Constitution are developmental uses." Post,
at 1065, n.3. We make no such assumption. Though our prior takings cases evince an
abiding concern for the productive use of, and economic investment in, land, there are
plainly a number of noneconomic interests in land whose impairment will invite exceedingly
close scrutiny under the Takings Clause. See, e. g., Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan
CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 436 (1982) (interest in excluding strangers from one's land).
385

B
The trial court found Lucas's two beachfront lots to have been rendered valueless by
respondent's enforcement of the coastal-zone construction ban.9 Under Lucas's theory of
the case, which rested upon our "no economically viable use" statements, that finding
entitled him to compensation. Lucas believed it unnecessary to take issue with either the
purposes behind the Beachfront Management Act, or the means chosen by the South
Carolina Legislature to effectuate those purposes. The South Carolina Supreme Court,
however, thought otherwise. In its view, the Beachfront Management Act was no ordinary
enactment, but involved an exercise of South Carolina's "police powers" to mitigate the
harm to the public interest that petitioner's use of his land might occasion. * * *
It is correct that many of our prior opinions have suggested that "harmful or noxious uses"
of property may be proscribed by government regulation without the requirement of
compensation. For a number of reasons, however, we think the South Carolina Supreme
Court was too quick to conclude that that principle decides the present case. The "harmful
or noxious uses" principle was the Court's early attempt to describe in theoretical terms why
government may, consistent with the Takings Clause, affect property values by regulation
without incurring an obligation to compensate-a reality we nowadays acknowledge explicitly
with respect to the full scope of the State's police power.* * * “Harmful or noxious use”
analysis was, in other words, simply the progenitor of our more contemporary statements
that "land-use regulation does not effect a taking if it 'substantially advance[s] legitimate
state interests' .... " Nollan, supra, at 834 (quoting Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U.S., at 260); see
also Penn Central Transportation Co., supra, at 127; Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S.
365, 387-388 (1926).
The transition from our early focus on control of "noxious" uses to our contemporary
understanding of the broad realm within which government may regulate without
compensation was an easy one, since the distinction between "harmpreventing" and
"benefit-conferring" regulation is often in the eye of the beholder. It is quite possible, for
example, to describe in either fashion the ecological, economic, and esthetic concerns that
inspired the South Carolina Legislature in the present case. One could say that imposing a
servitude on Lucas's land is necessary in order to prevent his use of it from "harming"
South Carolina's ecological resources; or, instead, in order to achieve the "benefits" of an
ecological preserve.11 Compare, e. g., Claridge v. New Hampshire [*1025] Wetlands Board,
11

In the present case, in fact, some of the "[South Carolina] legislature's 'findings' " to which
the South Carolina Supreme Court purported to defer in characterizing the purpose of the
Act as "harm-preventing," * * * seem to us phrased in "benefit conferring" language
instead. For example, they describe the importance of a construction ban in enhancing
"South Carolina's annual tourism industry revenue," * * * in "provid[ing] habitat for
numerous species of plants and animals, several of which are threatened or endangered,"
386

125 N.H. 745, 752, 485 A.2d 287, 292 (1984) (owner may, without compensation, be
barred from filling wetlands because landfilling would deprive adjacent coastal habitats and
marine fisheries of ecological support), with, e. g., Bartlett v. Zoning Comm'n of Old Lyme,
161 Conn. 24, 30, 282 A.2d 907, 910 (1971) (owner barred from filling tidal marshland must
be compensated, despite municipality's "laudable" goal of "preserv[ing] marshlands from
encroachment or destruction"). Whether one or the other of the competing
characterizations will come to one's lips in a particular case depends primarily upon one's
evaluation of the worth of competing uses of real estate. * * * A given restraint will be seen
as mitigating "harm" to the adjacent parcels or securing a "benefit" for them, depending
upon the observer's evaluation of the relative importance of the use that the restraint
favors. See Sax, Takings and the Police Power, 74 Yale L.J. 36, 49 (1964) ("[T]he problem
[in this area] is not one of noxiousness or harm-creating activity at all; rather it is a problem
of inconsistency between perfectly innocent and independently desirable uses"). Whether
Lucas's construction of single family residences on his parcels should be described as
bringing "harm" to South Carolina's adjacent ecological resources thus depends principally
upon whether the describer believes that the State's use interest in nurturing those
resources is so important that any competing adjacent use must yield.12
When it is understood that "prevention of harmful use" was merely our early formulation of
* * * and in "provid[ing] a natural healthy environment for the citizens of South Carolina to
spend leisure time which serves their physical and mental well-being," * * * It would be
pointless to make the outcome of this case hang upon this terminology, since the same
interests could readily be described in "harm-preventing" fashion.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, however, apparently insists that we must make the outcome hinge
(exclusively) upon the South Carolina Legislature's other, "harm-preventing"
characterizations, focusing on the declaration that "prohibitions on building in front of the
setback line are necessary to protect people and property from storms, high tides, and
beach erosion." * * * He says "[n]othing in the record undermines [this] assessment,"
* * * apparently seeing no significance in the fact that the statute permits owners of
existing structures to remain (and even to rebuild if their structures are not "destroyed
beyond repair," * * * ), and in the fact that the 1990 amendment authorizes the Council to
issue permits for new construction in violation of the uniform prohibition * * *
12

In JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S view, even with respect to regulations that deprive an owner
of all developmental or economically beneficial land uses, the test for required
compensation is whether the legislature has recited a harm-preventing justification for its
action. See post, at 1039, 1040-1041, 1047-1051. Since such a justification can be
formulated in practically every case, this amounts to a test of whether the legislature has a
stupid staff. We think the Takings Clause requires courts to do more than insist upon artful
harm-preventing characterizations.
387

the police power justification necessary to sustain (without compensation) any regulatory
diminution in value; and that the distinction between regulation that "prevents harmful use"
and that which "confers benefits" is difficult, if not impossible, to discern on an objective,
value-free basis; it becomes self-evident that noxious-use logic cannot serve as a
touchstone to distinguish regulatory "takings" -which require compensation -from regulatory
deprivations that do not require compensation. A fortiori the legislature's recitation of a
noxious-use justification cannot be the basis for departing from our categorical rule that
total regulatory takings must be compensated. If it were, departure would virtually always
be allowed. The South Carolina Supreme Court's approach would essentially nullify
Mahon's affirmation of limits to the noncompensable exercise of the police power. Our
cases provide no support for this: None of them that employed the logic of "harmful use"
prevention to sustain a regulation involved an allegation that the regulation wholly
eliminated the value of the claimant's land. See Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn., 480 U.S.,
at 513-514 (REHNQUIST, C. J., dissenting) * * *
Where the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial
use, we think it may resist compensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into the
nature of the owner's estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of his
title to begin with. * * * This accords, we think, with our "takings" jurisprudence, which has
traditionally been guided by the understandings of our citizens regarding the content of, and
the State's power over, the "bundle of rights" that they acquire when they obtain title to
property. It seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his
property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the
State in legitimate exercise of its police powers; "[a]s long recognized, some values are
enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power." Pennsylvania Coal
Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at 413. And in the case of personal property, by reason of the
State's traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings, he ought to be aware
of the possibility that new regulation might even render his property economically worthless
(at least if the property's only economically productive use is sale or manufacture for sale).
See Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 66-67 (1979) (prohibition on sale of eagle feathers). In
the case of land, however, we think the notion pressed by the Council that title is somehow
held subject to the "implied limitation" that the State may subsequently eliminate all
economically valuable use is inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the
Takings Clause that has become part of our constitutional culture.* * *
Where "permanent physical occupation" of land is concerned, we have refused to allow the
government to decree it anew (without compensation), no matter how weighty the asserted
"public interests" involved, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S., at
426 -though we assuredly would permit the government to assert a permanent easement
that was a pre-existing limitation upon the land title. * * *
We believe similar treatment must be accorded confiscatory regulations, i. e., regulations
that prohibit all economically beneficial use of land: Any limitation so severe cannot be
388

newly legislated or decreed (without compensation), but must inhere in the title itself, in the
restrictions that background principles of the State's law of property and nuisance already
place upon land ownership. A law or decree with such an effect must, in other words, do no
more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved in the courts-by adjacent
landowners (or other uniquely affected persons) under the State's law of private nuisance,
or by the State under its complementary power to abate nuisances that affect the public
generally, or otherwise.16
On this analysis, the owner of a lakebed, for example, would not be entitled to
compensation when he is denied the requisite permit to engage in a landfilling operation
that would have the effect of flooding others' land. Nor the corporate owner of a nuclear
generating plant, when it is directed to remove all improvements from its land upon
discovery that the plant sits astride an earthquake fault. Such regulatory action may well
have the effect of eliminating the land's only economically productive use, but it does not
proscribe a productive use that was previously permissible under relevant property and
nuisance principles. The use of these properties for what are now expressly prohibited
purposes was always unlawful, and (subject to other constitutional limitations) it was open
to the State at any point to make the implication of those background principles of nuisance
and property law explicit. * * * In light of our traditional resort to "existing rules or
understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law" to define the
range of interests that qualify for protection as "property" under the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments, Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972); see,
e. g., Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1011-1012 (1984); Hughes v.
Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 295 (1967) (Stewart, J., concurring), this recognition that the
Takings Clause does not require compensation when an owner is barred from putting land
to a use that is proscribed by those "existing rules or understandings" is surely
unexceptional. When, however, a regulation that declares "off-limits" all economically
productive or beneficial uses of land goes beyond what the relevant background principles
would dictate, compensation must be paid to sustain it.17

16

The principal "otherwise" that we have in mind is litigation absolving the State (or private
parties) of liability for the destruction of "real and personal property, in cases of actual
necessity, to prevent the spreading of a fire" or to forestall other grave threats to the lives
and property of others. Bowditch v. Boston, 101 U.S. 16, 18-19 (1880); see United States v.
Pacific R. Co., 120 U.S. 227, 238-239 (1887).
17

Of course, the State may elect to rescind its regulation and thereby avoid having to pay
compensation for a permanent deprivation. See First English Evangelical Lutheran Church,
482 U. S., at 321. But "where the [regulation has] already worked a taking of all use of
property, no subsequent action by the government can relieve it of the duty to provide
compensation for the period during which the taking was effective." Ibid.
389

The "total taking" inquiry we require today will ordinarily entail (as the application of state
nuisance law ordinarily entails) analysis of, among other things, the degree of harm to
public lands and resources, or adjacent private property, posed by the claimant's proposed
activities, see, e. g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 826, 827, the social value of the
claimant's activities and their suitability to the locality in question, see, e. g., id., §§ 828(a)
and (b), 831, and the relative ease with which the alleged harm can be avoided through
measures taken by the claimant and the government (or adjacent private landowners) alike,
see, e. g., id., §§ 827(e), 828(c), 830. The fact that a particular use has long been engaged
in by similarly situated owners ordinarily imports a lack of any common-law prohibition
(though changed circumstances or new knowledge may make what was previously
permissible no longer so, see id., § 827, Comment g. So also does the fact that other
landowners, similarly situated, are permitted to continue the use denied to the claimant.
It seems unlikely that common-law principles would have prevented the erection of any
habitable or productive improvements on petitioner's land; they rarely support prohibition of
the "essential use" of land, Curtin v. Benson, 222 U.S. 78, 86 (1911). The question,
however, is one of state law to be dealt with on remand. We emphasize that to win its case
South Carolina must do more than proffer the legislature's declaration that the uses Lucas
desires are inconsistent with the public interest, or the conclusory assertion that they violate
a common-law maxim such as sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. As we have said, a
"State, by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into public property without
compensation .... " Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 164
(1980). Instead, as it would be required to do if it sought to restrain Lucas in a commonlaw
action for public nuisance, South Carolina must identify background principles of nuisance
and property law that prohibit the uses he now intends in the circumstances in which the
property is presently found. Only on this showing can the State fairly claim that, in
proscribing all such beneficial uses, the Beachfront Management Act is taking nothing. 18
The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with
this opinion.
So ordered.

18

JUSTICE BLACKMUN decries our reliance on background nuisance principles at least in
part because he believes those principles to be as manipulable as we find the "harm
prevention" / "benefit conferral" dichotomy, see post, at 1054-1055. There is no doubt some
leeway in a court's interpretation of what existing state law permits-but not remotely as
much, we think, as in a legislative crafting of the reasons for its confiscatory regulation. We
stress that an affirmative decree eliminating all economically beneficial uses may be
defended only if an objectively reasonable application of relevant precedents would exclude
those beneficial uses in the circumstances in which the land is presently found.

Questions and Comments
1.

Categorical Rule: After Lucas, if government regulation of wetlands denies a
landowner “all economically beneficial or productive use” of their property, the
government will be required to compensate the landowner. If the impact of the
government action is less than a denial of all economically beneficial or productive
use of property, though, the court will continue to use the ad hoc, three factor Penn
Central analysis to determine whether the government action is a taking.

2.

Denial of All Economically Beneficial or Productive Use: Did the Court provide
any direction regarding how to determine when government regulation denies “all
economically beneficial or productive use” of a landowner’s property? In a separate
statement, Justice Souter suggested that the determination that the state regulation
deprived Lucas of his entire economic interest in his property was “highly
questionable”, and Souter suggested that the Court should dismiss the writ of
certiorari and await a case to directly address the issue of what constitutes a “total
deprivation” of use. 505 U.S. at 1076, 1078. In his dissenting opinion, Justice
Blackmun labeled the determination “implausible”. 505 U.S. at 1036. Why did the
South Carolina Coastal Council never challenge the trial court’s determination that
the regulation denied the landowner all economically beneficial or productive use of
his property?

3.

Temporary v. Permanent Taking: David Lucas bought the lots at issue in this
litigation in 1986. The Beachfront Management Act, which limited Lucas’
development of the property, was enacted in 1988. In 1990, after Lucas challenged
the statute and government regulation as a taking, the Act was amended to
authorize landowners like Lucas to apply for a permit to develop their property.
Lucas never applied for the permit, but pressed forward with his takings challenge. If
the Supreme Court was reviewing Lucas’ challenge as a permanent taking claim,
would the challenge be ripe? The Court did not review the challenge as a permanent
taking claim but, rather, as a claim that the state regulation constituted a “temporary
taking” from the time that the Beachfront Management Act was enacted until it was
amended to provide an opportunity to seek a permit (1988-1990). In a portion of the
opinion not reproduced above, the majority indicated that Lucas could still apply for
a permit even after the Supreme Court’s decision in the case. If Lucas were to
receive a permit to develop his property after the Court’s decision, what damages
could he recover for the temporary taking?

4.

An Exception to the Categorical Rule: Prior to the Lucas decision, it was believed
that there was a “noxious use” exception in takings jurisprudence, whereby
governments would not have to provide compensation, regardless of the extent of
economic harm caused by regulation, if the government was regulating to prevent a
391

“noxious use” of property. As the Lucas Court noted, the South Carolina Coastal
Council argued that regulation designed to prevent harm should be treated
differently than regulation to confer benefits on citizens. Although the Lucas Court
rejected that approach, how is the exception to the categorical rule created by the
Court different from the “noxious use” exception? Justice Blackmun, in dissent,
argues that the new test adopted by the Court could be as malleable as the harm
prevention/benefit conferral analysis that the Court was rejecting. What “background
principles of the State’s law of property and nuisance” will be considered in
determining that a regulated use of property is not “part of [the landowner’s] title to
begin with”, so that government regulation can extinguish that use without paying
compensation? Should the exception be limited to common law principles or can it
include state statutory provisions? In a concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy
suggested that reasonable expectations regarding property use should be
“understood in light of the whole of our legal tradition” and that the Court should not
limit its focus to the common law of nuisance and property. 505 U.S. at 1035. Did
the Lucas Court find that background principles of South Carolina nuisance or
property law prohibited the uses of property prohibited by the Beachfront
Management Act?
5.

Background Principles in Wetlands Cases: Although the Lucas Court allows the
government to avoid paying compensation when prohibiting uses of property that,
based on background principles of state property or nuisance law, are not part of the
landowner’s title to begin with, that exception has had little influence in wetlands
cases so far. The Court of Federal Claims and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit have generally rejected claims that wetland filling activities are
nuisances which can be prohibited by the government without compensation. See,
e.g., Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 28 F.3d 1171 (Fed. Cir. 1994); Florida
Rock Industries v. United States, 45 Fed. Cl. 21 (1999); Bowles v. United States, 31
Fed. Cl. 37 (1994); Florida Rock Industries v. United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 161 (1990),
vacated on other grounds, 18 F.3d 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1994), cert denied 513 U.S. 1109
(1995). While some state courts have viewed the “public trust” doctrine as a
background principle of state law that justifies regulation without compensation, see
Just v. Marinette County, 201 N.W.2d. 761 (Wis. 1972); McQueen v. South Carolina
Coastal Council, 580 S.E.2d 116 (S.C. 2003), the Court of Federal Claims and the
Federal Circuit have not adopted that approach.
For an outline of the “public trust” doctrine and a proposal for a new theoretical
framework for the doctrine, see Alexandra B. Klass, Modern Public Trust Principles:
Recognizing Rights and Integrating Standards, 82 Notre Dame L. Rev. 699 (2013).
For an exploration of whether “background principles” can evolve to incorporate
natural capital and ecosystem services, see J.B. Ruhl, The ‘Background Principles’
of Natural Capital and Ecosystem services - Did Lucas Open Pandora’s Box?, 22 J.
Land Use & Envtl L. 525 (2007). Professor Timothy M. Mulvaney also explores the
392

scope of “background principles” in Foreground Principles, 20 Geo. Mason L. Rev.
837 (2013). Professors Michael C. Blumm and Lucus Ritchie explore the rise in
categorical defenses to takings claims resulting from the Lucas focus on
“background principles” in Lucas’s Unlikely Legacy: The Rise of Background
Principles as Categorical Takings Defenses, 29 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 321 (2005).
6.

Agins v. City of Tiburon: The Lucas Court noted that the Supreme Court, in Agins
v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255 (1980), held that government regulation can be a
taking if it does not substantially advance legitimate state interests or if it denies an
owner economically viable use of his land. Although the Supreme Court routinely
cited that test in takings decisions, suggesting that government regulation that did
not deny an owner economically viable use of his land could still be a taking if the
regulation did not substantially advance legitimate state interests, the Court later
held, in Lingle v. Chevron, U.S.A., 544 U.S. 528 (2005), that the requirement that
government regulation substantially advance legitimate state interests is based on
the Due Process clause, and is not part of the takings analysis. That decision had
little impact on wetlands taking litigation, since few challengers ever asserted that
the government regulation of wetlands did not substantially advance legitimate
government interests.

7.

Subsequent History: On remand, the South Carolina Supreme Court found that
there were no background principles of South Carolina law that limited Lucas’
construction of a home on his property, so that the restrictions on his development
constituted a temporary taking of his property. See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Council, 424 S.E.2d 424, 23 E.L.R. 20297 (S.C. 1992). The South Carolina
Supreme Court then remanded the case to the trial court to make specific findings of
damages from the date of enactment of the Beachfront Management Act through
the date of the court’s order. Id. South Carolina ultimately settled the case for $1.5
million, buying the two lots from Lucas for $425,000 each, and paying legal fees,
costs, and interest. See H. Jane Lehman, Case Closed: Settlement Ends Property
Rights Lawsuit, Chicago Tribune, July 25, 1993. The State subsequently sold the
lots to a private developer for $750,000. See Royal C. Gardner, Lawyers, Swamps,
and Money 207 (Island Press 2011). In 1996, a 4200 square foot home was built on
Lot 22, and it was valued at $2,124,999 in 2013, according to the Charleston County
tax records (search for 11 Beachwood East, Isle of Palms). In 2001, a 3400 square
foot home was built on Lot 24, and it was valued at $2,700,000 in 2013. Id. (Search
for 13 Beachwood East, Isle of Palms). Professor Oliver Houck outlines the history
of the Lucas litigation in detail in More Unfinished Stories: Lucas, Atlanta Coalition,
and Palila/Sweet Home, 75 U. Colo. L. Rev. 331 (2004).

IV.

Applying Lucas and Penn Central in the Wetlands Context

While Lucas created a categorical rule for total
deprivations of economically beneficial or productive
uses of property, which the Court of Federal Claims has
applied in one case involving the denial by the Corps of
a Section 404 permit, see Lost Tree Village Corp. v.
United States, No. 08-117L (Fed. Cl. 03/14/2014), most
takings claims based on wetland regulation continue to
be analyzed under the Penn Central analysis. As noted
above, the analysis focuses on the extent of economic
impact on the landowner’s property caused by the
government action, the interference with the
landowner’s reasonable investment backed
expectations, and the character of the government
action.
In calculating the extent of economic impact, courts Photo 37 "Brass scales with cupped

the property immediately after the action. See Florida diaviewer/File:Brass_scales_with_cuppe
d_trays.png [CC-BY-SA-3.0]
Rock Industries v. United States, 18 F.3d 1560 (Fed.
Cir. 1994), cert denied 513 U.S. 1109 (1995); Bowles v. United States, 31 Fed. Cl. 37
(1994). Courts are no more willing to create bright line rules regarding the extent of
economic impact that could trigger a taking in the wetlands context than in other contexts.
While cases where plaintiffs have prevailed on takings claims for wetland permit denials
usually involve reductions in property value of 90% or more, see Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v.
United States, 28 F.3d 1171 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (99% reduction); Florida Rock Industries v.
United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 161 (1990) (95% reduction) the Court of Federal Claims has found
that a 73% reduction in property value could constitute a taking of property, when
considered in light of the other Penn Central factors. See Florida Rock Industries v. United
States, 45 Fed. Cl. 21 (1999). While landowners frequently assert that Corps permit denials
require them to leave wetlands in a natural state and render their property valueless, the
increase in mitigation banking, creating opportunities to reap economic benefits from
restoring, enhancing, preserving or creating wetlands, may impact the analysis of the
economic impact of development restrictions in more cases.
For the second Penn Central factor, in reviewing the extent to which government regulation
interferes with a landowner’s reasonable investment-backed expectations, courts focus
on the regulatory landscape that was in place at the time that the landowner acquired the
property. Although the Supreme Court has rejected a bright line rule that would prohibit
394

landowners from recovering for a taking if the regulatory scheme that allegedly triggers the
taking was in place at the time the landowner acquired the property, see Palazzolo v.
Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606 (2001), it is more difficult for the landowner to prove that the
government regulation interfered with reasonable investment backed expectations in such
a case. Thus, when a landowner acquired property after the Clean Water Act Section 404
permit program was implemented and it was clear that the program applied to wetlands, it
will be more difficult for the landowner to prevail on a claim that restrictions on development
of the property based on the 404 program constitute a taking than it will be for a landowner
who acquired property before the Section 404 program was implemented and applied to
wetlands. After all, to the extent that it was clear, at the time that the landowner acquired
the property, that a permit would be required to develop the property, any expectation that
the property can be developed without obtaining the permit, is unreasonable.
The final factor in the Penn Central analysis is the character of the government action.
As noted earlier, in focusing on this factor, courts often examine the “average reciprocity of
advantage” created by the government regulatory scheme. If a landowner receives a
benefit from restrictions placed on his property because other landowners are subject to
similar restrictions, courts will be less likely to find that the government restriction is a
taking. On the other hand, if courts feel that a landowner is being unfairly singled out and
forced to shoulder a significant share of the burden to protect a broad social interest, courts
will be more likely to find that the government restriction is a taking.
Questions and Comments
1.

Compensation: If a permit denial, a condition in a permit, or other land use
restriction in a wetlands protection program “takes” a landowner’s property, the
government will required to pay compensation for the restriction. To the extent that
the restriction deprives the landowner of all or almost of the property value, the
government can acquire title to the property in exchange for the payment of
compensation. However, if a government regulation only deprives a landowner of
70% of their property value, what should the remedy be? See Florida Rock
Industries v. United States, 45 Fed. Cl. 21 (1999).

2.

Temporary Takings: While landowners can recover compensation for temporary
takings caused by a government restriction on the use of property which is later
removed, courts have not found that the delay caused by the processing of a
Section 404 permit application constitutes a temporary taking. See Bay-Houston
Towing Co. v. United States, 58 Fed. Cl. 462 (2003). However, a landowner may be
able to recover compensation for damages suffered between the time that the Corps
denied the landowner a Section 404 permit and the time that the Corps eventually
issued the permit, following a judicial challenge to the initial permit denial, see
Resource Investments, Inc. v. United States, 85 Fed. Cl. 447 (2009), or for the
damages suffered between the time that the Corps issued a cease and desist order
395

and the time that a court remanded the matter to the Corps after a judicial challenge.
See Creppel v. United States, 30 Fed. Cl. 323 (1994), aff’d 41 F.3d 627 (Fed. Cir.
1994). To the extent that such claims are allowed, courts analyze the claims under
the Lucas or Penn Central frameworks, depending on the severity of the deprivation
of property use.
3.

Litigation Trends: The government prevailed in the first wetlands-related takings
lawsuit in 1970, Zabel v. Tabb, 430 F.2d 199 (1970), cert. denied 401 U.S. 910
(1971), as well as most of the takings lawsuits brought against it through the mid1980s. See, e.g., Deltona Corp. v. United States, 657 F.2d 1184 (Cl. Ct. 1981), cert.
denied, 455 U.S. 1017 (1982); Jentgen v. United States, 657 F.2d 1210 (Cl. Ct.
1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1017 (1982). From the mid-1980s through the mid1990s, courts found that Corps’ wetland permit denials constituted takings in several
cases, including two on the same day in 1990. See Florida Rock Industries v. United
States, 21 Cl. Ct. 161 (1990); Loveladies Harbor v. United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 153
(1990). The United States fared better between 1994 and 2005, prevailing in every
wetlands taking lawsuit except one. See Robert Meltz, Wetlands and Regulatory
Takings, in Wetlands Law and Policy: Understanding Section 404 429 (American
Bar Association, Section on Environment, Energy and Resources 2005). However,
the government did not fare as well in the recent litigation surrounding the Lost Tree
Village development in Florida, discussed after the next note.

4.

Parcel as a Whole: One issue that is significant for wetlands takings cases and was
raised in a footnote, but not resolved, in Lucas concerns the extent of the property
that courts examine when determining whether government regulation constitutes a
total deprivation of economically beneficial or productive use, for Lucas, and that
courts examine when determining the economic impact of government regulation for
Penn Central. If a person owns 100 acres of land that includes 20 acres of wetlands,
and the government regulatory scheme limits the development of the 20 acres of
wetlands, but does not limit the development of the other 80 acres, should the court
focus on the economic impact of the government regulation on the 20 acres or the
80 acres? The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that courts should focus their
analysis on the “parcel as a whole”, see Tahoe Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe
Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302 (2002); Penn Central Transportation
Company v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978); but the Court has not provided
concrete guidance on how to determine what constitutes the “parcel as a whole.” In
footnote 7 in Lucas, the Court did not establish a bright line rule but noted, instead,
that “[t]he answer to this difficult question may lie in how the owner's reasonable
expectations have been shaped by the State's law of property- i.e, whether and to
what degree the State's law has accorded legal recognition and protection to the
particular interest in land with respect to which the takings claimant alleges a
diminution in (or elimination of) value.”

396

Although the Supreme Court focused on state property law as the basis for
determining the extent of property to be evaluated in a takings case, when a
landowner contemporaneously acquires or owns several lots in the vicinity of a lot
containing wetlands, the Court of Federal Claims and the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit frequently focus on the expectations of the landowner and the
manner in which the landowner treated the property for development purposes in
determining whether the parcel to be evaluated is limited to the lot containing the
wetlands or whether the parcel includes other lots in the vicinity that the landowner
owns or acquired contemporaneously with the lot containing the wetlands. See, e.g.,
Palm Beach Isles Associates v. United States, 208 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2000);
Forest Properties, Inc. v. United States, 177 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1999).
The following case demonstrates the approach taken by the Federal Circuit.

The United States Court of Federal Claims determined that the Army Corps of Engineers
did not effect a regulatory taking compensable under the Fifth Amendment when it denied
Lost Tree Village Corporation's application for a permit to fill wetlands on its 4.99 acre plat
(Plat 57). In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Federal Claims found Lost Tree's parcel
as a whole includes Plat 57, a neighboring upland plat (Plat 55), and scattered wetlands in
the vicinity owned by Lost Tree at the time the permit was denied. Because the Court of
Federal Claims erred in its determination of the relevant parcel, this court reverses and
remands for further proceedings.
I
In 1968, Lost Tree Village Corporation (Lost Tree) entered an Option Agreement to
purchase approximately 2,750 acres of property on Florida's mid-Atlantic coast, near the
City of Vero Beach. The property covered by the Option Agreement encompasses a barrier
island on the Atlantic Ocean, which is bisected by the A-1-A Highway, and stretches
westward to interior land and islands on the Indian River. Lost Tree purchased substantially
all of the land covered by the Option Agreement in a series of transactions during the
period 1969-1974. In 1974, Lost Tree purchased the 4.99 acres now known as Plat 57 as
part of a transaction in which it acquired the entire peninsula on which Plat 57 is located
(known as the Island of John's Island), Gem Island, and other parcels in and along the
397

Indian River.
Beginning in 1969 and continuing through the mid-1990s, Lost Tree developed
approximately 1,300 acres of the property purchased under the 1968 Option Agreement
into the upscale gated residential community of John's Island. The John's Island community
includes most of Lost Tree's holdings on the barrier island, Gem Island, and the Island of
John's Island. The John's Island community also includes some property that was not
covered by the 1968 Option Agreement and was never owned by Lost Tree. Lost Tree built
the infrastructure for the community, including utilities, sewage systems, and the majority of
the roads and bridges within the community. The community includes two golf courses, a
beach club, a private hotel, condominiums, and single family homes. * * *
In 1980, Lost Tree submitted to the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) an application for a
permit under § 404 of the Clean Water Act * * * to make numerous infrastructure
improvements including construction of causeways connecting the barrier island, Gem
Island, and the Island of John's Island. The application also sought approval to dredge
canals and fill some wetland areas to create developable lots. Lost Tree's application was
accompanied by plans and drawings for its proposed development of the Island of John's
Island and Gem Island (the 1980 Development Plan). A drawing in the 1980 Development
Plan depicts a substantial portion of Plat 57, as well as other areas, shaded in green and
labeled "wildlife preserve." * * *
The Corps did not act on Lost Tree's 1980 permit application as submitted because the
State of Florida required numerous changes to Lost Tree's plans. Lost Tree submitted a
revised proposal to the Corps in 1982. The proposal stated that "all originally proposed
project features are being deleted from this application except the bridge from John[']s
[Island] to Gem Island and its approaches." * * * The Corps approved a modified version of
the 1982 application, and development of the Island of John's Island and Gem Island
proceeded throughout the 1980s and 1990s "in a manner that diverged in significant ways
from the 1980 Application." * * * During development, Lost Tree sought and received two
additional § 404 permits for infrastructure improvements and construction of canals, and
reserved various parcels as conservation easements by deed restrictions recorded in favor
of the local, state, or federal government. Plat 57 was not among the land dedicated for
conservation.
Plat 57 lies on Stingaree Point, a small peninsula located on the southwestern portion of
the Island of John's Island. Lost Tree developed Stingaree Point in 1985-1986. At that time,
the company built Stingaree Point Road, installed water and sewer lines, and recorded Plat
40, which is comprised of six lots to the south and west of the road. Also in 1985, Lost Tree
"stubbed out" water and sewer lines to Plat 40 and to unplatted land on the eastern end of
the Point that was later recorded as Plat 55. Lost Tree sold the six lots on Plat 40 within a
few years after the plat was recorded. Homes have been built on those properties.

398

To east of Plat 40, on the north side of Stingaree Point Road, is the 4.99 acre tract
eventually recorded as Plat 57. Plat 57 consists of 1.41 acres of submerged lands and 3.58
acres of wetlands with some upland mounds installed by Florida's "Mosquito Control"
authority. To the east of Plat 57 is a mosquito control impoundment, a narrow, 323 foot long
shoulder along the north side of the road, and then Plat 55. Although Lost Tree neither
"stubbed out" nor recorded Plat 57 when it developed the rest of Stingaree Point, an April
1986 appraisal stated that "Stingaree Point development is substantially completed, with
the exception of the entrance area, landscaping, and a final layer of asphalt on the road."
***
As the trial court found, Plat 57 was "ignored entirely" during Lost Tree's development of
Stingaree Point and the rest of John's Island. * * * In 1994, when "most knowledgeable
people considered development of the community of John's Island to have been completed,
the property constituting Plat 57 had not been platted, utilities had not been extended to it,
nor had it been dedicated to any use such as mitigation for a project on other plats." * * *
Lost Tree did not consider Plat 57 for development until approximately 2002, when the
company learned it would obtain "mitigation credits" as a result of improvements a
neighboring landowner had agreed to make as part of a development project. Lost Tree
identified Plat 57 as a property that could be developed profitably to exploit the mitigation
credits. In August 2002, Lost Tree filed an application with the Town of Indian River Shores
requesting approval for a preliminary plat and permission to fill 2.13 acres of wetland on the
property. The company then filed a corresponding application for a § 404 wetlands fill
permit from the Corps. Lost Tree obtained all state and local approvals to develop Plat 57
into a site for one residential home. The Corps, however, denied Lost Tree's § 404 permit
application in August 2004, stating that less environmentally damaging alternatives were
available, and that Lost Tree "has had very reasonable use of its land at John's Island."
***
II
The Court of Federal Claims held a seven-day trial, after which it denied Lost Tree's takings
claim. The trial court rejected the government's argument that the entire John's Island
community is the relevant parcel for the takings analysis, finding Lost Tree's development
of Plat 57 was "physically and temporally remote from" its development of the rest of the
community. * * * The court also rejected Lost Tree's argument that the relevant parcel was
Plat 57 alone. Instead, the court determined that the relevant parcel is "Plat 57 and Plat 55,
plus those scattered wetlands still owned by Lost Tree within the community of John's
Island." * * * The court found that, while Plats 55 and 57 are "distinct legal parcels, they are
undoubtedly contiguous." * * * Further, it found Lost Tree has comparable usage objectives
for the two plats, because it hopes to sell for profit the lots on each plat.

399

Based on its relevant parcel determination, the trial court found the Corps' denial of the §
404 permit application for Plat 57 "diminished the value of Lost Tree's property by
approximately 58.4%." * * * After analyzing the factors set forth in Penn Central
Transportation Co. v. City of New York * * * , the court found the diminution in value
insufficient support a takings claim. Lost Tree appeals, and this court has jurisdiction
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(3).
III
***
Lost Tree asserts the denial of a § 404 permit to fill wetlands on Plat 57 by the Corps
effectively deprived Lost Tree of its property such that it is entitled to just compensation
under the Fifth Amendment. While the Government's authority to "prevent a property owner
from filling or otherwise injuring or destroying vital wetlands" is unquestioned, the issue is
whether the denial of a fill permit for a particular project imposes a disproportionate loss on
the affected landowner. Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 28 F.3d 1171, 1175 (Fed.
Cir. 1994) * * *
Regulations requiring land to be left substantially in its natural state – such as when a
wetlands fill permit is denied – may sometimes "leave the owner of land without
economically beneficial or productive options for its use." Lucas v. S. Carolina Coastal
Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1018 (1992). In the "relatively rare situations where the
government has deprived a landowner of all economically beneficial uses," the regulatory
action is recognized as a "categorical taking" that must be compensated. Id.; see Florida
Rock Indus., Inc. v. United States, 18 F.3d 1560, 1564-65 (Fed. Cir. 1994). * * *
Most regulatory takings cases, however, are analyzed under the framework set out in Penn
Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978). * * *
In many cases, as here, the definition of the relevant parcel of land is a crucial antecedent
that determines the extent of the economic impact wrought by the regulation. Keystone
Bituminous Coal Ass'n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 496 (1987) ("Because our test for
regulatory taking requires us to compare the value that has been taken from the property
with the value that remains in the property, one of the critical questions is determining how
to define the unit of property 'whose value is to furnish the denominator of the fraction.'")
* * * ; Palm Beach Isles, 208 F.3d at 1380 (discussing the "denominator problem").
Definition of the relevant parcel affects not only whether a particular regulation is a
categorical taking under Lucas, but also affects the Penn Central inquiry into the economic
impact of the regulation on the claimant and on investment-backed expectations. The
relevant parcel determination is a question of law based on underlying facts. Palm Beach
Isles, 208 F.3d at 1380.

400

The Supreme Court has not settled the question of how to determine the relevant parcel in
regulatory takings cases, but it has provided some helpful guideposts. See Lucas, 505 U.S.
at 1016 n.7. First, the property interest taken is not defined in terms of the regulation being
challenged; the takings analysis must focus on "the parcel as a whole." * * * Second, the
"parcel as a whole" does not extend to all of a landowner's disparate holdings in the vicinity
of the regulated property. Lucas, 505 U.S. 1003, 1017 n.7, 112 S. Ct. 2886, 120 L. Ed. 2d
798 (characterizing as "extreme" and "unsupportable" the state court's analysis in Penn
Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 42 N.Y.2d 324, 333-34, (N.Y. 1977) aff'd, 438
U.S. 104 (1978), which examined the diminution in a particular parcel's value in light of the
total value of the takings claimant's other holdings in the vicinity).
This court has taken a "flexible approach, designed to account for factual nuances," in
determining the relevant parcel where the landowner holds (or has previously held) other
property in the vicinity. Loveladies, 28 F.3d at 1181. In this inquiry, the "critical issue is 'the
economic expectations of the claimant with regard to the property.'" Norman v. United
States, 429 F.3d 1081, 1091 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (quoting Forest Props., Inc. v. United States,
177 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir.1999)). When a "developer treats several legally distinct
parcels as a single economic unit, together they may constitute the relevant parcel." Forest
Props., 177 F.3d at 1365 (holding relevant parcel included 53 upland acres and 9 acres of
lake bottom where tracts were acquired at different times but "economic reality" was that
owner treated the property as single integrated project).
Conversely, even when contiguous land is purchased in a single transaction, the relevant
parcel may be a subset of the original purchase where the owner develops distinct parcels
at different times and treats the parcels as distinct economic units. Palm Beach Isles, 208
F.3d at 1381 (holding relevant parcel consisted of 50.7 acre wetland portion of original
311.7 acre purchase where landowner "never planned to develop the parcels as a single
unit," and sold 261 acres of upland, oceanfront property prior to enactment of relevant
regulatory scheme); Loveladies, 28 F.3d at 1181 (holding relevant parcel consisted of 12.5
acres from original 250 acre purchase where landowner developed and sold 199 acres
before regulatory scheme was enacted and deeded remaining 38.5 acres to state in
exchange for development permits).
Here, Lost Tree did not treat Plat 57 as part of the same economic unit as other land it
developed into the John's Island community. The trial court correctly found that Lost Tree
did not include Plat 57 in its formal or informal development plans for the community. * * *
The only proposal that ever addressed Plat 57 was the unapproved 1980 Permit
Application. While the 1980 application proposed dedicating Plat 57 as a wildlife preserve
to mitigate other development, Lost Tree withdrew that application. Thus, when the Corps
eventually granted Lost Tree's permit application, Plat 57 had no designated use.
The government argues Plat 57 was informally part of the John's Island development
because Lost Tree intentionally included undeveloped land within the perimeter of its gated
401

community. Lost Tree advertised such "open spaces" as part of the unique environment
offered by John's Island. However, Lost Tree expressly planned open spaces in its
development of the community, through the use of large lots for single family homes, and
inclusion of golf courses and dedicated conservation wetlands. Lost Tree's failure to plan
for Plat 57 even as open space supports the trial court's conclusion that the parcel was
"ignored"--rather than intentionally left undeveloped--when the company carried out the
John's Island project. * * *
Lost Tree's actual course of development further demonstrates that it did not treat Plat 57
as part of the John's Island community. Lost Tree did not seek a fill permit or run utility
service to the area that became Plat 57 when it developed the rest of Stingaree Point. Plat
55, by contrast, was brought to grade and water and sewer lines were stubbed out to that
area. Although the company did not immediately plat the land that became Plat 55, it
developed it in the mid-1980s in preparation for eventual sale as part of the John's Island
community. Plat 57, by contrast, was absent from Lost Tree's development plans until
2002--at least seven years after the development of the John's Island community was
considered complete. * * *
Indeed, the record shows that after 1982, Lost Tree was essentially unaware of its
ownership of Plat 57 until the company prepared an inventory of its residual properties in
1995. At that time, Lost Tree had already transitioned its business from real estate
development to focus on investment in commercial properties. The company also was
working to divest itself of remaining real estate holdings in the vicinity of John's Island.
When the Corps denied Lost Tree's § 404 permit application in 2002, the company held
only the "West Acreage," which lies well outside the John's Island community, Plat 55, Plat
57, and scattered wetlands within John's Island. The objective evidence of Lost Tree's
actions demonstrates that the company considered the John's Island community completed
long before it proposed to fill wetlands on Plat 57. The company's long hiatus from
development efforts reinforces the conclusion that Lost Tree did not consider Plat 57 part of
the same economic unit as the John's Island community.
In short, this court sees no error in the trial court's factual findings that "Lost Tree's belated
decision to develop Plat 57 was not part of its planned actual or projected use of the
property constituting the community of John's Island." * * * This finding, however, conflicts
with the court's conclusion that the relevant parcel comprises not just Plat 57, but also Plat
55 and "scattered wetlands still owned by Lost Tree within the community of John's Island."
* * * Unlike Plat 57, Lost Tree treated Plat 55 as part of the John's Island community,
developing it for eventual sale as three single family home sites at the same time that it
developed Plat 40 on Stingaree Point.
The Court of Federal Claims erred by aggregating Plat 57, Plat 55, and the scattered
wetlands as the relevant parcel. The only links between the two plats identified by the trial
court are: 1) they are connected by the 323 foot strip of land owned by Lost Tree and
402

therefore "undoubtedly contiguous," and 2) both currently are held with the "usage
objective[ ] . . . to sell for profit the lots" on each plat. * * * Similarly, the scattered wetlands
are only linked to Plat 57 by their geographic location within the gated community of John's
Island. Here, the mere fact that the properties are commonly owned and located in the
same vicinity is an insufficient basis on which to find they constitute a single parcel for
purposes of the takings analysis. * * * Loveladies, 28 F.3d at 1180 (holding relevant parcel
excludes 6.4 acres of previously-developed uplands purchased in same transaction as
regulated parcel and owned by claimant when § 404 permit was denied).
After a careful review of the entire record, this court determines that the relevant parcel is
Plat 57 alone. The trial court's factual findings support the conclusion that Lost Tree had
distinct economic expectations for each of Plat 57, Plat 55, and its scattered wetland
holdings in the vicinity. Because the Court of Federal Claims erred in its determination of
the relevant parcel, this court reverses the judgment and remands for further proceedings.
On remand, the court first should determine the loss in economic value to Plat 57 suffered
by Lost Tree as a result of the Corps' denial of the § 404 permit, and then apply the
appropriate framework to determine whether a compensable taking occurred. In
determining the loss in value to Plat 57, the court may revisit the property values it adopted
in the course of determining the impact of the Plat 57 permit denial on Lost Tree under its
definition of the relevant parcel. * * *
IV
For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims is reversed
and remanded for further proceedings.
Questions and Comments
1.

The Remand: On remand, the Court of Federal Claims concluded that the value of
Plat 57 in light of the Corps’ permit denial was $27,500, which the court
characterized as “a nominal amount that does not reflect any economic use.” See
Lost Tree Village Corp. v. United States, No. 08-117L (Fed. Cl. 03/14/2014). Thus,
the court held that the Corps’ action was a categorical taking under Lucas. Despite
reaching that conclusion, the court also analyzed the Corps’ action under the Penn
Central analysis. For purposes of that analysis, the court suggested that the 99.4%
reduction in property value that resulted from the Corps’ permit denial was a factor
that weighed in favor of finding a taking. Id. The court also suggested that the
character of the government action weighed in favor of finding a taking, because the
court was persuaded that the landowner was singled out for adverse treatment in
the case, and that the Corps would have issued a permit for the proposed
development if a different develop had applied for the permit. Id.

Strategic Behavior: Justice Stevens, in a dissenting opinion in Lucas, predicted
that the Court’s decision in that case could be manipulated in light of the lack of a
clear definition of the “parcel as a whole.” 505 U.S. at 1065. Stevens predicted,
“developers and investors may market specialized estates to take advantage of the
Court’s new rule. The smaller the estate, the more likely that a regulatory change
will effect a total taking. Thus, an investor may, for example, purchase the right to
build a multifamily home on a specific lot * * * ”
Hypothetical
Toby Mercer bought 100 acres of land in Monroe County, Georgia in 1970 from Lucy Tift for
$100,000. Lucy sold the land, the Tift's family farm, when her father, Herschel, died. In 1985,
Mercer subdivided the property into 75 lots, ranging in size from ½ acre to 2 acres, and a 10
acre lot, which he planned to set aside as a nature preserve for the subdivision. Between
1985 and 1998, Mercer developed or sold all of the lots, other than the 10 acre lot, for $1.5
million. In 2008, he decided to develop the remaining 10 acre lot. At that time, he subdivided
the lot into 10 lots, ranging in size from ½ acre to an acre, and a 2 acre lot. He sold the 10
lots for $200,000 and sought a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit from the Corps of
Engineers to fill the entire 2 acres of wetlands on the remaining lot, in order to build a house
on the property.
During the public hearings on Mercer's proposal, Maggie Green vigorously protested the
permit because she owned an organic farm on the property adjacent to Mercer's property
and Mercer's proposal to fill the wetlands on his property would greatly increase flooding on
her property and destroy her farm. Although Mercer and the Corps discussed other
development options that would impact fewer acres of wetlands, the Corps ultimately told
Mercer that they would not authorize him to fill any of the wetlands on his property, and they
denied his permit application.
Mercer is upset because the property can now only be used as a nature preserve. A realtor
he retained has indicated that the property is worth about $8,000, but would be worth about
$130,000, if he could build a house on the property. Mercer files a lawsuit against the Corps
of Engineers in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging that the denial of his permit
application constitutes a taking of his property. Should the court award Mercer compensation
for a taking of his property?

V.

Mitigation, Permit Conditions and Exactions

Although most takings challenges in the wetlands context involve permit denials, conditions
included in a permit, such as mitigation requirements, can also be challenged as takings
based on a line of Supreme Court decisions that prohibit “exactions” takings. In Nollan v.
California Coastal Commission, 483 U.S. 825, 836-37 (1987), when a landowner
404

challenged the California Coastal Commission’s decision to require the landowner to
provide an easement for public beach access as a condition of approving a permit to allow
construction of a house on the beach, the Supreme Court held that there must be an
“essential nexus” between a legitimate state interest and a condition imposed in a permit or
the permit condition will constitute a taking. The Court began its analysis by indicating that
if California had simply required the Nollans to provide an easement for public access
outside of the permitting context, it would clearly constitute a taking of property. Id. at 831.
At the same time, the Court recognized that the state could deny the Nollan’s development
permit without facing a constitutional challenge if the permit denial substantially advanced a
legitimate state interest. Id. at 835-836. Consequently, the Court held that the state could
include conditions in the permit that serve the same legitimate purpose without violating the
Constitution. Id. at 836. The Court’s decision seemed to be based, in part, on the Court’s
holding, in Agins v. City of Tiburon, that a regulation can be a taking if it does not
substantially advance a legitimate state interest.
A few years later, the Supreme Court returned to the exactions issue in Dolan v. City of
Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994). In that case, a landowner challenged the decision of the city
planning commission, when approving the expansion of her store and paving of the parking
lot for the store, to condition the approval on dedication of land for a greenway and a bike
path. Id. The Court reiterated the “essential nexus” requirement of Nollan, but added a
requirement that the permit issuer must make an individualized determination that the
permit condition is “related both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed
development.” Id. at 391. The Court required that the condition must be “roughly
proportional” to the impact of the proposed development. Id. Rather than simply citing
Agins as authority for the new takings limits, the Dolan Court based its holding on the
“unconstitutional conditions” doctrine, which provides that “the government may not require
a person to give up a constitutional right - here the right to receive just compensation when
property is taken for a public use - in exchange for a discretionary benefit where the benefit
sought has little or no relationship to the property.” Id. at 385.
In light of Nollan and Dolan, when a permit condition is challenged as an unconstitutional
taking, the government has the burden of demonstrating that there is an essential nexus
between the permit condition and a legitimate state objective and that the condition is
roughly proportional to the impact of the proposed development. Although the Supreme
Court held, in Lingle v. Chevron, 544 U.S. 528 (2005), that the “substantially advances a
legitimate state interest” requirement in Agins was based on the process clause, rather
than the takings clause, the Lingle Court held that its holding did not require it to disturb the
holdings in Nollan and Dolan. Id.
In the wetlands context, the government should normally be able to meet the requirements
of Nollan and Dolan when including conditions in Section 404 permits. When the Corps or
EPA include conditions in permits to minimize harm to wetlands or to require compensatory
mitigation for such harm, there is an “essential nexus” between those conditions and the
405

legitimate government interest in protecting water quality and the environment. With
mitigation conditions especially, the government makes an individualized determination of
the amount and type of mitigation that are necessary to compensate for the values and
functions of the wetlands that will be lost due to the development activity authorized by the
permit. In most cases, therefore, this individualized analysis should meet the “rough
proportionality” requirement of Dolan.
Questions and Comments
1.

Mitigation Ratios: As discussed in Chapter 7, the ratio of mitigation acreage that
the government will require compared to the acreage of wetlands harmed by an
activity authorized by a Section 404 permit will vary depending on whether the
mitigation involves creation, restoration, enhancement, or preservation of wetlands,
and depending on the location and type of wetlands being harmed and being
protected. Although the mitigation ratios will vary, the goal of the government in
fashioning the mitigation requirements is to replace the values and functions of the
wetlands that are being harmed. As long as the government can demonstrate those
connections in litigation, the mitigation requirements should meet the “essential
nexus” and “rough proportionality” tests.

2.

Mitigation Banking and In Lieu Fee Mitigation: Mitigation banking may involve
protection of different types of wetlands than the wetlands that are harmed by
development authorized by a Section 404 permit and will usually involve protection
of wetlands that are not located at the site of the development project. Is it harder to
defend mitigation banking conditions in a wetland permit under the Nollan and Dolan
tests than it would be to defend a condition that required on-site, in-kind mitigation?
What if the mitigation bank was authorized to issue mitigation credits in watersheds
other than the watershed where the permitted activity occurred? Are there concerns
raised by in lieu fee mitigation permit conditions that are not raised by mitigation
banking or on-site, in-kind mitigation?

3.

Burden of Proof: When the Corps of Engineers denies a Section 404 permit or
EPA vetoes a Section 404 permit, the landowner, in a takings action, has the burden
of demonstrating that the government’s action has “gone too far” under the Penn
Central analysis. Note, though, that when a landowner challenges the conditions
included in a permit issued by the government, the government has the burden of
demonstrating that the conditions meet the “essential nexus” and “rough
proportionality” requirements.

of local governments to attach conditions to land use permits to address future
cumulative impacts of the proposed development in Exactions for the Future, 64

5.

Scope of Nollan and Dolan: The Supreme Court’s rulings in Nollan and Dolan both
involved cases where a government entity required a landowner to provide public
access to their property as a condition for approval of a permit or development
proposal. The following case examines whether Nollan and Dolan apply when the
government denies a permit or approval because the landowner won’t agree to a
permit condition and whether they apply to conditions that do not involve requiring
public access to property.

Our decisions in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S. 825 (1987), and Dolan v.
City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994), provide important protection against the misuse of the
power of land-use regulation. In those cases, we held that a unit of government may not
condition the approval of a land-use permit on the owner’s relinquishment of a portion of his
property unless there is a “nexus” and “rough proportionality” between the government’s
demand and the effects of the proposed land use. In this case, the St. Johns River Water
Management District (District) believes that it circumvented Nollan and Dolan because of
the way in which it structured its handling of a permit application submitted by Coy Koontz,
Sr., whose estate is represented in this Court by Coy Koontz, Jr. * * * The District did not
approve his application on the condition that he surrender an interest in his land. Instead,
the District, after suggesting that he could obtain approval by signing over such an interest,
denied his application because he refused to yield. The Florida Supreme Court blessed this
maneuver and thus effectively interred those important decisions. Because we conclude
that Nollan and Dolan cannot be evaded in this way, the Florida Supreme Court’s decision
must be reversed.

I
A
In 1972, petitioner purchased an undeveloped 14.9-acre tract of land on the south side of
Florida State Road 50, a divided four-lane highway east of Orlando. The property is located
less than 1,000 feet from that road’s intersection with Florida State Road 408, a tolled
expressway that is one of Orlando’s major thoroughfares.
A drainage ditch runs along the property’s western edge, and high-voltage power lines
bisect it into northern and southern sections. The combined effect of the ditch, a 100 foot
wide area kept clear for the power lines, the highways, and other construction on nearby
parcels is to isolate the northern section of petitioner’s property from any other
undeveloped land. Although largely classified as wetlands by the State, the northern
section drains well; the most significant standing water forms in ruts in an unpaved road
used to access the power lines. The natural topography of the property’s southern section
is somewhat more diverse, with a small creek, forested uplands, and wetlands that
sometimes have water as much as a foot deep. A wildlife survey found evidence of animals
that often frequent developed areas: raccoons, rabbits, several species of bird, and a turtle.
The record also indicates that the land may be a suitable habitat for opossums.
The same year that petitioner purchased his property, Florida enacted the Water
Resources Act, which divided the State into five water management districts and authorized
each district to regulate “construction that connects to, draws water from, drains water into,
or is placed in or across the waters in the state.” * * * Under the Act, a landowner wishing
to undertake such construction must obtain from the relevant district a Management and
Storage of Surface Water (MSSW) permit, which may impose “such reasonable conditions”
on the permit as are “necessary to assure” that construction will “not be harmful to the
water resources of the district.” * * *
In 1984, in an effort to protect the State’s rapidly diminishing wetlands, the Florida
Legislature passed the Warren S. Henderson Wetlands Protection Act, which made it illegal
for anyone to “dredge or fill in, on, or over surface waters” without a Wetlands Resource
Management (WRM) permit. * * * Under the Henderson Act, permit applicants are required
to provide “reasonable assurance” that proposed construction on wetlands is “not contrary
to the public interest,” as defined by an enumerated list of criteria. * * * Consistent with the
Henderson Act, the St. Johns River Water Management District, the district with jurisdiction
over petitioner’s land, requires that permit applicants wishing to build on wetlands offset the
resulting environmental damage by creating, enhancing, or preserving wetlands elsewhere.
Petitioner decided to develop the 3.7-acre northern section of his property, and in 1994 he
applied to the District for MSSW and WRM permits. Under his proposal, petitioner would
408

have raised the elevation of the northernmost section of his land to make it suitable for a
building, graded the land from the southern edge of the building site down to the elevation
of the high-voltage electrical lines, and installed a dry-bed pond for retaining and gradually
releasing stormwater runoff from the building and its parking lot. To mitigate the
environmental effects of his proposal, petitioner offered to foreclose any possible future
development of the approximately 11acre southern section of his land by deeding to the
District a conservation easement on that portion of his property.
The District considered the 11 acre conservation easement to be inadequate, and it
informed petitioner that it would approve construction only if he agreed to one of two
concessions. First, the District proposed that petitioner reduce the size of his development
to 1 acre and deed to the District a conservation easement on the remaining 13.9 acres. To
reduce the development area, the District suggested that petitioner could eliminate the drybed pond from his proposal and instead install a more costly subsurface stormwater
management system beneath the building site. The District also suggested that petitioner
install retaining walls rather than gradually sloping the land from the building site down to
the elevation of the rest of his property to the south.
In the alternative, the District told petitioner that he could proceed with the development as
proposed, building on 3.7 acres and deeding a conservation easement to the government
on the remainder of the property, if he also agreed to hire contractors to make
improvements to District-owned land several miles away. Specifically, petitioner could pay
to replace culverts on one parcel or fill in ditches on another. Either of those projects would
have enhanced approximately 50 acres of District-owned wetlands. When the District asks
permit applicants to fund offsite mitigation work, its policy is never to require any particular
offsite project, and it did not do so here. Instead, the District said that it “would also
favorably consider” alternatives to its suggested offsite mitigation projects if petitioner
proposed something “equivalent.” * * *
Believing the District’s demands for mitigation to be excessive in light of the environmental
effects that his building proposal would have caused, petitioner filed suit in state court.
Among other claims, he argued that he was entitled to relief under Fla. Stat. §373.617(2),
which allows owners to recover “monetary damages” if a state agency’s action is “an
unreasonable exercise of the state’s police power constituting a taking without just
compensation.” * * *
II
A
We have said in a variety of contexts that “the government may not deny a benefit to a
person because he exercises a constitutional right.” * * *

409

Nollan and Dolan “involve a special application” of this doctrine that protects the Fifth
Amendment right to just compensation for property the government takes when owners
apply for land-use permits. Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 547 (2005); Dolan,
512 U.S., at 385 (invoking “the well-settled doctrine of ‘unconstitutional conditions’”). Our
decisions in those cases reflect two realities of the permitting process. The first is that landuse permit applicants are especially vulnerable to the type of coercion that the
unconstitutional conditions doctrine prohibits because the government often has broad
discretion to deny a permit that is worth far more than property it would like to take. By
conditioning a building permit on the owner’s deeding over a public right-of- way, for
example, the government can pressure an owner into voluntarily giving up property for
which the Fifth Amendment would otherwise require just compensation. * * * So long as
the building permit is more valuable than any just compensation the owner could hope to
receive for the right-of-way, the owner is likely to accede to the government’s demand, no
matter how unreasonable. Extortionate demands of this sort frustrate the Fifth Amendment
right to just compensation, and the unconstitutional conditions doctrine prohibits them.
A second reality of the permitting process is that many proposed land uses threaten to
impose costs on the public that dedications of property can offset. Where a building
proposal would substantially increase traffic congestion, for example, officials might
condition permit approval on the owner’s agreement to deed over the land needed to widen
a public road. Respondent argues that a similar rationale justifies the exaction at issue
here: petitioner’s proposed construction project, it submits, would destroy wetlands on his
property, and in order to compensate for this loss, respondent demands that he enhance
wetlands elsewhere. Insisting that landowners internalize the negative externalities of their
conduct is a hallmark of responsible land-use policy, and we have long sustained such
regulations against constitutional attack. * * *
Nollan and Dolan accommodate both realities by allowing the government to condition
approval of a permit on the dedication of property to the public so long as there is a “nexus”
and “rough proportionality” between the property that the government demands and the
social costs of the applicant’s proposal. * * * Our precedents thus enable permitting
authorities to insist that applicants bear the full costs of their proposals while still forbidding
the government from engaging in “out-and-out . . . extortion” that would thwart the Fifth
Amendment right to just compensation. * * * Under Nollan and Dolan the government may
choose whether and how a permit applicant is required to mitigate the impacts of a
proposed development, but it may not leverage its legitimate interest in mitigation to pursue
governmental ends that lack an essential nexus and rough proportionality to those impacts.
B
The principles that undergird our decisions in Nollan and Dolan do not change depending
on whether the government approves a permit on the condition that the applicant turn over
property or denies a permit because the applicant refuses to do so. We have often
410

concluded that denials of governmental benefits were impermissible under the
unconstitutional conditions doctrine. * * * In so holding, we have recognized that
regardless of whether the government ultimately succeeds in pressuring someone into
forfeiting a constitutional right, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine forbids burdening the
Constitution’s enumerated rights by coercively withholding benefits from those who
exercise them.
A contrary rule would be especially untenable in this case because it would enable the
government to evade the limitations of Nollan and Dolan simply by phrasing its demands
for property as conditions precedent to permit approval. Under the Florida Supreme Court’s
approach, a government order stating that a permit is “approved if” the owner turns over
property would be subject to Nollan and Dolan, but an identical order that uses the words
“denied until” would not. Our unconstitutional conditions cases have long refused to attach
significance to the distinction between conditions precedent and conditions subsequent.
See Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Comm’n of Cal., 271 U.S. 583 –593 (1926)
(invalidating regulation that required the petitioner to give up a constitutional right “as a
condition precedent to the enjoyment of a privilege”); Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton, 146
U.S. 202, 207 (1892) (invalidating statute “requiring the corporation, as a condition
precedent to obtaining a permit to do business within the State, to surrender a right and
privilege secured to it by the Constitution”). * * * To do so here would effectively render
Nollan and Dolan a dead letter.
The Florida Supreme Court puzzled over how the government’s demand for property can
violate the Takings Clause even though “ ‘no property of any kind was ever taken,’ ” * * *
but the unconstitutional conditions doctrine provides a ready answer. Extortionate demands
for property in the land-use permitting context run afoul of the Takings Clause not because
they take property but because they impermissibly burden the right not to have property
taken without just compensation. As in other unconstitutional conditions cases in which
someone refuses to cede a constitutional right in the face of coercive pressure, the
impermissible denial of a governmental benefit is a constitutionally cognizable injury.
Nor does it make a difference, as respondent suggests, that the government might have
been able to deny petitioner’s application outright without giving him the option of securing
a permit by agreeing to spend money to improve public lands. See Penn Central Transp.
Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978). Virtually all of our unconstitutional conditions
cases involve a gratuitous governmental benefit of some kind. * * * Yet we have repeatedly
rejected the argument that if the government need not confer a benefit at all, it can withhold
the benefit because someone refuses to give up constitutional rights. E.g., United States v.
American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U.S. 194, 210 (2003) (“[T]he government may not deny a
benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected . . . freedom of
speech even if he has no entitlement to that benefit” (emphasis added and internal
quotation marks omitted)); Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 191 (1952) (explaining in
unconstitutional conditions case that to focus on “the facile generalization that there is no
411

constitutionally protected right to public employment is to obscure the issue”). Even if
respondent would have been entirely within its rights in denying the permit for some other
reason, that greater authority does not imply a lesser power to condition permit approval on
petitioner’s forfeiture of his constitutional rights. See Nollan, 483 U.S., at 836–837
(explaining that “[t]he evident constitutional propriety” of prohibiting a land use “disappears .
. . if the condition substituted for the prohibition utterly fails to further the end advanced as
the justification for the prohibition”).
That is not to say, however, that there is no relevant difference between a consummated
taking and the denial of a permit based on an unconstitutionally extortionate demand.
Where the permit is denied and the condition is never imposed, nothing has been taken.
While the unconstitutional conditions doctrine recognizes that this burdens a constitutional
right, the Fifth Amendment mandates a particular remedy—just compensation—only for
takings. In cases where there is an excessive demand but no taking, whether money
damages are available is not a question of federal constitutional law but of the cause of
action—whether state or federal—on which the landowner relies. Because petitioner
brought his claim pursuant to a state law cause of action, the Court has no occasion to
discuss what remedies might be available for a Nollan/Dolan unconstitutional conditions
violation either here or in other cases. * * *
We hold that the government’s demand for property from a land use permit applicant must
satisfy the requirements of Nollan and Dolan even when the government denies the permit
* * * . The Court expresses no view on the merits of petitioner’s claim that respondent’s
actions here failed to comply with the principles set forth in this opinion and those two
cases. The Florida Supreme Court’s judgment is reversed, and this case is remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Questions and Comments
1.

Burden of Proof: In light of this decision, when the government denies a permit
because the applicant refuses to agree to a condition proposed for the permit, in a
takings challenge, the government will have the burden of proving that the rejected
condition meets the “essential nexus” and “rough proportionality” tests. As noted
above, if the landowner were challenging the permit denial as a taking because of
the impact of the denial on the landowner’s use of property, the landowner would
have the burden of demonstrating that the denial constituted a taking under the
Penn Central analysis. Did the Koontz Court determine that the government
demonstrated that either of the mitigation proposals it requested met the “essential
nexus” and “rough proportionality” tests?

2.

Compensation: When a regulation “goes too far”, a property owner is entitled to
just compensation. If the government denies a permit application because the
applicant won’t agree to a condition that violates the Nollan or Dolan tests, but the
412

permit denial doesn’t “go too far” under the Penn Central analysis, what remedy is
available to the landowner? Has anything been taken?
3.

Which Conditions are Examined? The Section 404 permit application process
frequently will involve negotiations regarding mitigation requirements or other permit
conditions. The Corps may propose some conditions which it later decides to take
off the table. Does Koontz suggest that a court should strike down a permit denial
whenever any of the conditions proposed in negotiations violate the Nollan or Dolan
tests, or do courts only look at the last offer that was on the table before the
government denied a permit? How might the Koontz decision and the manner in
which courts answer the question above affect the permit negotiation process? If the
government can deny a permit outright without “going too far” to limit property usage
under Penn Central, should it invite potential litigation by requesting permit
conditions in the negotiation process that might be challenged under Nollan and
Dolan?

4.

Money Payments: In a portion of the opinion not reproduced above, the Koontz
Court also held that Nollan and Dolan applied when the government asks a
landowner, through a permit condition, to spend money instead of providing an
easement over property. The Court wrote: “if we accept this argument it would be
very easy for land use permitting officials to evade the limitations of Nollan and
Dolan. Because the government need only provide a permit applicant with one
alternative that satisfies the nexus and rough proportionality standards, a permitting
authority wishing to exact an easement could simply give the owner a choice of
either surrendering an easement or making a payment equal to the easement’s
value. Such so called ‘in lieu of’ fees are utterly commonplace * * * and they are
functionally equivalent to other types of land use exactions. For that reason and
those that follow, we reject respondent’s argument and hold that so-called ‘monetary
exactions’ must satisfy the nexus and rough proportionality requirements * * * ” In
light of the Court’s holding, it seems fairly clear that conditions included in Section
404 permits that require mitigation through the use of in lieu fee mitigation programs
would be analyzed under the Nollan and Dolan tests.

environmental law in a presentation at Vermont Law School entitled Koontz: A Big
Yawn for Environmental Law? Video of their presentation is available on YouTube.

Other Takings-Related Requirements

Because of the financial liability associated with takings, the Corps, EPA and wetland
regulators routinely consider the likelihood that their actions will be challenged as takings
when deciding whether to issue or deny permits and when deciding what conditions to
include in permits. Even if they did not have a financial incentive to undertake that analysis,
413

federal wetland regulators are required, by a Presidential Executive Order, to consider the
takings implications of their actions. Executive Order 12630, issued in 1988, requires
federal agencies, among other things, to consider the takings implications of actions before
undertaking those actions and to document the takings analysis for regulations in the notice
of proposed rulemaking, and to submit to the Office of Management and Budget, annually,
a list of actions that have been challenged as, or held to be, takings. See Executive Order
12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property
Rights, 53 Fed. Reg. 8859 (Mar. 15, 1988). For permits, the Executive Order requires that
conditions in the permit “serve the same purpose that would have been served by a
prohibition of the use or action; and ... substantially advance that purpose.” Id. ¶ 4. In
addition, the Order provides that “When a proposed action would place a restriction on a
use of private property, the restriction imposed on the use shall not be disproportionate to
the extent to which the use contributes to the overall problem that the restriction is imposed
to redress.” Id.
In a 2003 report, the General Accounting Office (GAO) examined the implementation of the
Executive Order by the Corps, EPA, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of
Interior, and concluded that the Order was not being aggressively implemented. See
General Accounting Office, GAO-03-1015, Regulatory Takings: Implementation of
Executive Order on Government Actions Affecting Private Property Use (Sept. 2003). GAO
criticized the Department of Justice for failing to update guidelines regarding the
implementation of the Executive Order and noted that OMB had informed agencies, in
1994, that they did not have to submit annual reports outlining the just compensation
challenges or awards against the agencies. Id. at 4. Since takings claims against federal
agencies are litigated by the Department of Justice, GAO was able to obtain data from the
Department regarding the volume of takings claims against the four agencies during the
three fiscal years preceding the report. Id. at 5. Between FY 2000 and FY 2002, 44 takings
lawsuits were filed against the Corps, EPA, the Department of Agriculture or the
Department of Interior. Id. The plaintiffs prevailed in 14 of those cases and received $36.5
million in awards or settlements. Id. GAO determined that the Executive Order did not apply
to the actions of the agencies in 11 of those 14 cases, and determined that the four
agencies generally only conducted the takings analysis required by the Executive Order in
1 out of every 3 cases where the Order did apply. Id. By the end of 2002, plaintiffs filed 54
more takings lawsuits against one or more of the four agencies. Id.
Just as federal agencies are required to evaluate the takings implications of actions before
they undertake the actions, many state agencies are required to engage in similar analyses
before undertaking actions. According to a 2013 study prepared by the Environmental Law
Institute, at least 17 states have adopted legislation that requires state government officials
to assess their actions for potential constitutional takings implications or for other impacts
on private property rights. See Environmental Law Institute, State Constraints: StateImposed Limitations on the Authority of Agencies to Regulate Waters Beyond the Scope of
the Federal Clean Water Act 24 (May 2013). Most of the states require the government
414

officials to assess their own actions, but 3 states require agency officials to have at least
some rulemakings reviewed for compliance by the attorney general or a legislative
committee.

Interviewing and Drafting Problem
Doctor Leslie McCoy, a cardiologist from Charlotte, North Carolina, bought some property on
Ocracoke Island, North Carolina a few years ago to build a vacation home. Apparently, there were
some wetlands on the property that she bought. A few years later, she built a house on one of the
lots that she bought and sold that house. Within the past few months, though, she tried to build a
house on the other lot, but the Corps of Engineers would not grant her a Clean Water Act permit to
fill the wetlands on the property. She thinks that challenging the validity of the permit denial is futile,
but she wants to challenge the permit denial as a taking of her property. She says that the property
is basically worthless now, and she bought it for $100,000.
Questions
1. Draft a series of questions that you would ask Doctor McCoy in order to evaluate the strength of
any takings claim that she might have, based on the Corps’ Section 404 permit denial. If you are
not familiar with client interviewing techniques, or have not conducted client interviews in the past,
the attached short summary of client interviewing may be helpful. The interview should include a
mix of open-ended and closed-ended questions that will elicit the information that is necessary to
determine whether the client can establish the prima facie case for a taking (i.e., economic impact
of the decision, interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations, character of the
government action, rationale for the government’s action, identification of the parcel as a whole,
final definitive agency position, etc.).
2. Doctor McCoy has arranged to meet with you to explore whether she should pursue a takings
claim against the Corps of Engineers. Interview her and gather the information that you will need to
assess the strength of her takings claim. For purposes of this simulation, it is not necessary to
discuss financial arrangements for the representation. The confidential information for Doctor
McCoy is in the teacher’s manual.
