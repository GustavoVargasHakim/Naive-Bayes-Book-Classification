# Naive-Bayes-Book-Classification
Book classification by genre using the Naive Bayes Algorithm. Six categories are used: mathematics, law, management, social sciences, biology and literature. 

A database containing 180 books have been constructed. There are 30 books of each category. From each 30 books, 20 are aimed to be used for training the algorithm and 10 are used for validation.
