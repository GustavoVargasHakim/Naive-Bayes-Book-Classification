About the Authors
David Lippman received his master’s degree in mathematics from
Western Washington University and has been teaching at Pierce
College since Fall 2000.
Melonie Rasmussen also received her
master’s degree in mathematics from
Western Washington University and has
been teaching at Pierce College since Fall
2002. Prior to this Melonie taught for the
Puyallup School district for 6 years after
receiving her teaching credentials from Pacific Lutheran
University.
We have both been long time advocates of open learning, open materials, and basically
any idea that will reduce the cost of education for students. It started by supporting the
college’s calculator rental program, and running a book loan scholarship program.
Eventually the frustration with the escalating costs of commercial text books and the
online homework systems that charged for access led them to take action.
First, David developed IMathAS, open source online math homework software that runs
WAMAP.org and MyOpenMath.com. Through this platform, we became integral parts
of a vibrant sharing and learning community of teachers from around Washington State
that support and contribute to WAMAP. Our pioneering efforts, supported by dozens of
other dedicated faculty and financial support from the Transition Math Project, have led
to a system used by thousands of students every quarter, saving hundreds of thousands of
dollars over comparable commercial offerings.
David continued further and wrote his first open textbook, Math in Society, a math for
liberal arts majors book, after being frustrated by students having to pay $100+ for a
textbook for a terminal course. Together, frustrated by both cost and the style of
commercial texts, we began writing PreCalculus: An Investigation of Functions in 2010.

Preface
Over the years, when reviewing books we found that many had been mainstreamed by
the publishers in an effort to appeal to everyone, leaving them with very little character.
There were only a handful of books that had the conceptual and application driven focus
we liked, and most of those were lacking in other aspects we cared about, like providing
students sufficient examples and practice of basic skills. The largest frustration, however,
was the never ending escalation of cost and being forced into new editions every three
years. We began researching open textbooks, however the ability for those books to be
adapted, remixed, or printed were often limited by the types of licenses, or didn’t
approach the material the way we wanted.
This book is available online for free, in both Word and PDF format. You are free to
change the wording, add materials and sections or take them away. We welcome
feedback, comments and suggestions for future development at
precalc@opentextbookstore.com. Additionally, if you add a section, chapter or problems,
we would love to hear from you and possibly add your materials so everyone can benefit.
In writing this book, our focus was on the story of functions. We begin with function
notation, a basic toolkit of functions, and the basic operation with functions: composition
and transformation. Building from these basic functions, as each new family of functions
is introduced we explore the important features of the function: its graph, domain and
range, intercepts, and asymptotes. The exploration then moves to evaluating and solving
equations involving the function, finding inverses, and culminates with modeling using
the function.
The "rule of four" is integrated throughout - looking at the functions verbally,
graphically, numerically, as well as algebraically. We feel that using the “rule of four”
gives students the tools they need to approach new problems from various angles. Often
the “story problems of life” do not always come packaged in a neat equation. Being able
to think critically, see the parts and build a table or graph a trend, helps us change the
words into meaningful and measurable functions that model the world around us.
There is nothing we hate more than a chapter on exponential equations that begins
"Exponential functions are functions that have the form f(x)=ax." As each family of
functions is introduced, we motivate the topic by looking at how the function arises from
life scenarios or from modeling. Also, we feel it is important that precalculus be the
bridge in level of thinking between algebra and calculus. In algebra, it is common to see
numerous examples with very similar homework exercises, encouraging the student
to mimic the examples. Precalculus provides a link that takes students from the basic
plug & chug of formulaic calculations towards building an understanding that equations
and formulas have deeper meaning and purpose. While you will find examples and
similar exercises for the basic skills in this book, you will also find examples of multistep
problem solving along with exercises in multistep problem solving. Often times these
exercises will not exactly mimic the exercises, forcing the students to employ their
critical thinking skills and apply the skills they've learned to new situations. By

iv
developing students’ critical thinking and problem solving skills this course prepares
students for the rigors of Calculus.
While we followed a fairly standard ordering of material in the first half of the book, we
took some liberties in the trig portion of the book. It is our opinion that there is no need
to separate unit circle trig from triangle trig, and instead integrated them in the first
chapter. Identities are introduced in the first chapter, and revisited throughout. Likewise,
solving is introduced in the second chapter and revisited more extensively in the third
chapter. As with the first part of the book, an emphasis is placed on motivating the
concepts and on modeling and interpretation.

Supplements

with the goal of creating open courseware for the 81 highest enrolled community college
courses with a price cap on course materials of $30. We were chosen to work on
precalculus for this project, and that helped drive us to complete our book, and allowed
us to create supplemental materials.

How To Be Successful In This Course
This is not a high school math course, although for some of you the content may seem
familiar. There are key differences to what you will learn here, how quickly you will be
required to learn it and how much work will be required of you.
You will no longer be shown a technique and be asked to mimic it repetitively as the only
way to prove learning. Not only will you be required to master the technique, but you
will also be required to extend that knowledge to new situations and build bridges
between the material at hand and the next topic, making the course highly cumulative.
As a rule of thumb, for each hour you spend in class, you should expect this course will
require an average of 2 hours of out-of-class focused study. This means that some of you
with a stronger background in mathematics may take less, but if you have a weaker
background or any math anxiety it will take you more.
Notice how this is the equivalent of having a part time job, and if you are taking a
fulltime load of courses as many college students do, this equates to more than a full time
job. If you must work, raise a family and take a full load of courses all at the same time,
we recommend that you get a head start & get organized as soon as possible. We also
recommend that you spread out your learning into daily chunks and avoid trying to cram
or learn material quickly before an exam.
To be prepared, read through the material before it is covered in class and note or
highlight the material that is new or confusing. The instructor’s lecture and activities
should not be the first exposure to the material. As you read, test your understanding
with the Try it Now problems in the book. If you can’t figure one out, try again after
class, and ask for help if you still can’t get it.
As soon as possible after the class session recap the day’s lecture or activities into a
meaningful format to provide a third exposure to the material. You could summarize
your notes into a list of key points, or reread your notes and try to work examples done in
class without referring back to your notes. Next, begin any assigned homework. The
next day, if the instructor provides the opportunity to clarify topics or ask questions, do
not be afraid to ask. If you are afraid to ask, then you are not getting your money’s
worth! If the instructor does not provide this opportunity, be prepared to go to a tutoring
center or build a peer study group. Put in quality effort and time and you can get quality
results.
Lastly, if you feel like you do not understand a topic. Don’t wait, ASK FOR HELP!
ASK: Ask a teacher or tutor, Search for ancillaries, Keep a detailed list of questions
FOR: Find additional resources, Organize the material, Research other learning options
HELP: Have a support network, Examine your weaknesses, List specific examples & Practice

Best of luck learning! We hope you like the course & love the price.
David & Melonie

Section 1.1 Functions and Function Notation
What is a Function?
The natural world is full of relationships between quantities that change. When we see
these relationships, it is natural for us to ask “If I know one quantity, can I then determine
the other?” This establishes the idea of an input quantity, or independent variable, and a
corresponding output quantity, or dependent variable. From this we get the notion of a
functional relationship in which the output can be determined from the input.
For some quantities, like height and age, there are certainly relationships between these
quantities. Given a specific person and any age, it is easy enough to determine their
height, but if we tried to reverse that relationship and determine age from a given height,
that would be problematic, since most people maintain the same height for many years.
Function
Function: A rule for a relationship between an input, or independent, quantity and an
output, or dependent, quantity in which each input value uniquely determines one
output value. We say “the output is a function of the input.”
Example 1
In the height and age example above, is height a function of age? Is age a function of
height?
In the height and age example above, it would be correct to say that height is a function
of age, since each age uniquely determines a height. For example, on my 18th birthday,
I had exactly one height of 69 inches.
However, age is not a function of height, since one height input might correspond with
more than one output age. For example, for an input height of 70 inches, there is more
than one output of age since I was 70 inches at the age of 20 and 21.

2 Chapter 1
Example 2
At a coffee shop, the menu consists of items and their prices. Is price a function of the
item? Is the item a function of the price?
We could say that price is a function of the item, since each input of an item has one
output of a price corresponding to it. We could not say that item is a function of price,
since two items might have the same price.
Example 3
In many classes the overall percentage you earn in the course corresponds to a decimal
grade point. Is decimal grade a function of percentage? Is percentage a function of
decimal grade?
For any percentage earned, there would be a decimal grade associated, so we could say
that the decimal grade is a function of percentage. That is, if you input the percentage,
your output would be a decimal grade. Percentage may or may not be a function of
decimal grade, depending upon the teacher’s grading scheme. With some grading
systems, there are a range of percentages that correspond to the same decimal grade.
One-to-One Function
Sometimes in a relationship each input corresponds to exactly one output, and every
output corresponds to exactly one input. We call this kind of relationship a one-to-one
function.
From Example 3, if each unique percentage corresponds to one unique decimal grade
point and each unique decimal grade point corresponds to one unique percentage then it
is a one-to-one function.
Try it Now
Let’s consider bank account information.
1. Is your balance a function of your bank account number?
(if you input a bank account number does it make sense that the output is your balance?)

2. Is your bank account number a function of your balance?
(if you input a balance does it make sense that the output is your bank account number?)

Function Notation
To simplify writing out expressions and equations involving functions, a simplified
notation is often used. We also use descriptive variables to help us remember the
meaning of the quantities in the problem.

Section 1.1 Functions and Function Notation

3

Rather than write “height is a function of age”, we could use the descriptive variable h to
represent height and we could use the descriptive variable a to represent age.
“height is a function of age”
“h is f of a”
h = f(a)
h(a)

if we name the function f we write
or more simply
we could instead name the function h and write
which is read “h of a”

Remember we can use any variable to name the function; the notation h(a) shows us that
h depends on a. The value “a” must be put into the function “h” to get a result. Be
careful - the parentheses indicate that age is input into the function (Note: do not confuse
these parentheses with multiplication!).
Function Notation
The notation output = f(input) defines a function named f. This would be read “output
is f of input”
Example 4
Introduce function notation to represent a function that takes as input the name of a
month, and gives as output the number of days in that month.
The number of days in a month is a function of the name of the month, so if we name
the function f, we could write “days = f(month)” or d = f(m). If we simply name the
function d, we could write d(m)
For example, d(March) = 31, since March has 31 days. The notation d(m) reminds us
that the number of days, d (the output) is dependent on the name of the month, m (the
input)
Example 5
A function N = f(y) gives the number of police officers, N, in a town in year y. What
does f(2005) = 300 tell us?
When we read f(2005) = 300, we see the input quantity is 2005, which is a value for the
input quantity of the function, the year (y). The output value is 300, the number of
police officers (N), a value for the output quantity. Remember N=f(y). So this tells us
that in the year 2005 there were 300 police officers in the town.
Tables as Functions
Functions can be represented in many ways: Words (as we did in the last few examples),
tables of values, graphs, or formulas. Represented as a table, we are presented with a list
of input and output values.

4 Chapter 1
In some cases, these values represent everything we know about the relationship, while in
other cases the table is simply providing us a few select values from a more complete
relationship.
Table 1: This table represents the input, number of the month (January = 1, February = 2,
and so on) while the output is the number of days in that month. This represents
everything we know about the months & days for a given year (that is not a leap year)

The first and second tables define functions. In both, each input corresponds to exactly
one output. The third table does not define a function since the input value of 5
corresponds with two different output values.
Only the first table is one-to-one; it is both a function, and each output corresponds to
exactly one input. Although table 2 is a function, because each input corresponds to
exactly one output, each output does not correspond to exactly one input so this
function is not one-to-one. Table 3 is not even a function and so we don’t even need to
consider if it is a one-to-one function.

3. If each percentage earned translated to one letter grade, would this be a function? Is
it one-to-one?
Solving and Evaluating Functions:
When we work with functions, there are two typical things we do: evaluate and solve.
Evaluating a function is what we do when we know an input, and use the function to
determine the corresponding output. Evaluating will always produce one result, since
each input of a function corresponds to exactly one output.
Solving equations involving a function is what we do when we know an output, and use
the function to determine the inputs that would produce that output. Solving a function
could produce more than one solution, since different inputs can produce the same
output.

Evaluating g(3) (read: “g of 3”)
means that we need to determine the output value, Q, of the function g given the input
value of n=3. Looking at the table, we see the output corresponding to n=3 is Q=7,
allowing us to conclude g(3) = 7.
b) Solve g(n) = 6
Solving g(n) = 6 means we need to determine what input values, n, produce an output
value of 6. Looking at the table we see there are two solutions: n = 2 and n = 4.
When we input 2 into the function g, our output is Q = 6
When we input 4 into the function g, our output is also Q = 6
Try it Now
4. Using the function in Example 7, evaluate g(4)
Graphs as Functions
Oftentimes a graph of a relationship can be used to define a function. By convention,
graphs are typically created with the input quantity along the horizontal axis and the
output quantity along the vertical.

5

6 Chapter 1
The most common graph has y on the vertical axis and x on the horizontal axis, and we
say y is a function of x, or y = f(x) when the function is named f.
y

x

Example 8
Which of these graphs defines a function y=f(x)? Which of these graphs defines a oneto-one function?

Looking at the three graphs above, the first two define a function y=f(x), since for each
input value along the horizontal axis there is exactly one output value corresponding,
determined by the y-value of the graph. The 3rd graph does not define a function y=f(x)
since some input values, such as x=2, correspond with more than one output value.
Graph 1 is not a one-to-one function. For example, the output value 3 has two
corresponding input values, -2 and 2.3
Graph 2 is a one-to-one function; each input corresponds to exactly one output, and
every output corresponds to exactly one input.
Graph 3 is not even a function so there is no reason to even check to see if it is a one-toone function.
Vertical Line Test
The vertical line test is a handy way to think about whether a graph defines the vertical
output as a function of the horizontal input. Imagine drawing vertical lines through the
graph. If any vertical line would cross the graph more than once, then the graph does
not define only one vertical output for each horizontal input.

Section 1.1 Functions and Function Notation

7

Horizontal Line Test
Once you have determined that a graph defines a function, an easy way to determine if
it is a one-to-one function is to use the horizontal line test. Draw horizontal lines
through the graph. If any horizontal line crosses the graph more than once, then the
graph does not define a one-to-one function.
Evaluating a function using a graph requires taking the given input and using the graph to
look up the corresponding output. Solving a function equation using a graph requires
taking the given output and looking on the graph to determine the corresponding input.
Example 9
Given the graph below,
a) Evaluate f(2)
b) Solve f(x) = 4

a) To evaluate f(2), we find the input of x=2 on the horizontal axis. Moving up to the
graph gives the point (2, 1), giving an output of y=1. So f(2) = 1
b) To solve f(x) = 4, we find the value 4 on the vertical axis because if f(x) = 4 then 4 is
the output. Moving horizontally across the graph gives two points with the output of 4:
(-1,4) and (3,4). These give the two solutions to f(x) = 4: x = -1 or x = 3
This means f(-1)=4 and f(3)=4, or when the input is -1 or 3, the output is 4.
Notice that while the graph in the previous example is a function, getting two input
values for the output value of 4 shows us that this function is not one-to-one.

Formulas as Functions
When possible, it is very convenient to define relationships using formulas. If it is
possible to express the output as a formula involving the input quantity, then we can
define a function.

8 Chapter 1
Example 10
Express the relationship 2n + 6p = 12 as a function p = f(n) if possible.
To express the relationship in this form, we need to be able to write the relationship
where p is a function of n, which means writing it as p = [something involving n].
2n + 6p = 12
6p = 12 - 2n

p

subtract 2n from both sides
divide both sides by 6 and simplify

12  2n 12 2n
1
 
 2 n
6
6 6
3

Having rewritten the formula as p=, we can now express p as a function:
1
p  f ( n)  2  n
3
It is important to note that not every relationship can be expressed as a function with a
formula.
Note the important feature of an equation written as a function is that the output value can
be determined directly from the input by doing evaluations - no further solving is
required. This allows the relationship to act as a magic box that takes an input, processes
it, and returns an output. Modern technology and computers rely on these functional
relationships, since the evaluation of the function can be programmed into machines,
whereas solving things is much more challenging.
Example 11
Express the relationship x 2  y 2  1 as a function y = f(x) if possible.
If we try to solve for y in this equation:
y 2  1  x2

y   1  x2
We end up with two outputs corresponding to the same input, so this relationship cannot
be represented as a single function y = f(x)
As with tables and graphs, it is common to evaluate and solve functions involving
formulas. Evaluating will require replacing the input variable in the formula with the
value provided and calculating. Solving will require replacing the output variable in the
formula with the value provided, and solving for the input(s) that would produce that
output.

Example 12
Given the function k (t )  t 3  2
a) Evaluate k(2)
b) Solve k(t) = 1
a) To evaluate k(2), we plug in the input value 2 into the formula wherever we see the
input variable t, then simplify
k (2)  23  2
k (2)  8  2
So k(2) = 10
b) To solve k(t) = 1, we set the formula for k(t) equal to 1, and solve for the input value
that will produce that output
k(t) = 1
substitute the original formula k (t )  t 3  2
t3  2  1
subtract 2 from each side
3
take the cube root of each side
t  1
t  1
When solving an equation using formulas, you can check your answer by using your
solution in the original equation to see if your calculated answer is correct.
We want to know if k (t )  1 is true when t  1 .
k (1)  (1)3  2
= 1  2
= 1 which was the desired result.
Example 13
Given the function h( p)  p 2  2 p
a) Evaluate h(4)
b) Solve h(p) = 3
To evaluate h(4) we substitute the value 4 for the input variable p in the given function.
a) h(4)  (4)2  2(4)
= 16 + 8
= 24
b) h(p) = 3
p2  2 p  3
p2  2 p  3  0
p2  2 p  3  0
( p  3)( p  1)  0

Substitute the original function h( p)  p 2  2 p
This is quadratic, so we can rearrange the equation to get it = 0
subtract 3 from each side
this is factorable, so we factor it

10 Chapter 1
By the zero factor theorem since ( p  3)( p  1)  0 , either ( p  3)  0 or ( p  1)  0 (or
both of them equal 0) and so we solve both equations for p, finding p = -3 from the first
equation and p = 1 from the second equation.
This gives us the solution: h(p) = 3 when p = 1 or p = -3
We found two solutions in this case, which tells us this function is not one-to-one.

Basic Toolkit Functions
In this text, we will be exploring functions – the shapes of their graphs, their unique
features, their equations, and how to solve problems with them. When learning to read,
we start with the alphabet. When learning to do arithmetic, we start with numbers.
When working with functions, it is similarly helpful to have a base set of elements to
build from. We call these our “toolkit of functions” – a set of basic named functions for
which we know the graph, equation, and special features.
For these definitions we will use x as the input variable and f(x) as the output variable.

You will see these toolkit functions, combinations of toolkit functions, their graphs and
their transformations frequently throughout this book. In order to successfully follow
along later in the book, it will be very helpful if you can recognize these toolkit functions
and their features quickly by name, equation, graph and basic table values.
Not every important equation can be written as y = f(x). An example of this is the
equation of a circle. Recall the distance formula for the distance between two points:

dist  x2  x1    y 2  y1 
A circle with radius r with center at (h, k) can be described as all points (x, y) a distance

Section 1.2 Domain and Range
One of our main goals in mathematics is to model the real world with mathematical
functions. In doing so, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of those models we
create.
This table shows a relationship between circumference and height of a tree as it grows.

While there is a strong relationship between the two, it would certainly be ridiculous to
talk about a tree with a circumference of -3 feet, or a height of 3000 feet. When we
identify limitations on the inputs and outputs of a function, we are determining the
domain and range of the function.
Domain and Range
Domain: The set of possible input values to a function
Range: The set of possible output values of a function
Example 1
Using the tree table above, determine a reasonable domain and range.
We could combine the data provided with our own experiences and reason to
approximate the domain and range of the function h = f(c). For the domain, possible
values for the input circumference c, it doesn’t make sense to have negative values, so c
> 0. We could make an educated guess at a maximum reasonable value, or look up that
the maximum circumference measured is about 119 feet1. With this information we
would say a reasonable domain is 0  c  119 feet.
Similarly for the range, it doesn’t make sense to have negative heights, and the
maximum height of a tree could be looked up to be 379 feet, so a reasonable range is
0  h  379 feet.
Example 2
When sending a letter through the United States Postal Service, the price depends upon
the weight of the letter2, as shown in the table below. Determine the domain and range.

Letters
Weight not Over
1 ounce
2 ounces
3 ounces
3.5 ounces

Price
$0.44
$0.61
$0.78
$0.95

Suppose we notate Weight by w and Price by p, and set up a function named P, where
Price, p is a function of Weight, w. p = P(w).
Since acceptable weights are 3.5 ounces or less, and negative weights don’t make sense,
the domain would be 0  w  3.5 . Technically 0 could be included in the domain, but
logically it would mean we are mailing nothing, so it doesn’t hurt to leave it out.
Since possible prices are from a limited set of values, we can only define the range of
this function by listing the possible values. The range is p = $0.44, $0.61, $0.78, or
$0.95.
Try it Now
1. The population of a small town in the year 1960 was 100 people. Since then the
population has grown to 1400 people reported during the 2010 census. Choose
descriptive variables for your input and output and use interval notation to write the
domain and range.
Notation
In the previous examples, we used inequalities to describe the domain and range of the
functions. This is one way to describe intervals of input and output values, but is not the
only way. Let us take a moment to discuss notation for domain and range.
Using inequalities, such as 0  c  163 , 0  w  3.5 , and 0  h  379 imply that we are
interested in all values between the low and high values, including the high values in
these examples.
However, occasionally we are interested in a specific list of numbers like the range for
the price to send letters, p = $0.44, $0.61, $0.78, or $0.95. These numbers represent a set
of specific values: {0.44, 0.61, 0.78, 0.95}
Representing values as a set, or giving instructions on how a set is built, leads us to
another type of notation to describe the domain and range.
Suppose we want to describe the values for a variable x that are 10 or greater, but less
than 30. In inequalities, we would write 10  x  30 .

Section 1.2 Domain and Range 23
When describing domains and ranges, we sometimes extend this into set-builder
notation, which would look like this:  x |10  x  30 . The curly brackets {} are read as
“the set of”, and the vertical bar | is read as “such that”, so altogether we would read
x |10  x  30 as “the set of x-values such that 10 is less than or equal to x and x is less
than 30.”
When describing ranges in set-builder notation, we could similarly write something like
 f ( x) | 0  f ( x)  100 , or if the output had its own variable, we could use it. So for our
tree height example above, we could write for the range h | 0  h  379 . In set-builder
notation, if a domain or range is not limited, we could write t | t is a real number , or

t | t   , read as “the set of t-values such that t is an element of the set of real numbers.
A more compact alternative to set-builder notation is interval notation, in which
intervals of values are referred to by the starting and ending values. Curved parentheses
are used for “strictly less than,” and square brackets are used for “less than or equal to.”
Since infinity is not a number, we can’t include it in the interval, so we always use curved
parentheses with ∞ and -∞. The table below will help you see how inequalities
correspond to set-builder notation and interval notation:

To combine two intervals together, using inequalities or set-builder notation we can use
the word “or”. In interval notation, we use the union symbol,  , to combine two
unconnected intervals together.
Example 3
Describe the intervals of values shown on the line graph below using set builder and
interval notations.

24 Chapter 1
To describe the values, x, that lie in the intervals shown above we would say, “x is a real
number greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3, or a real number greater
than 5.”
As an inequality it is: 1  x  3 or x  5
In set builder notation:  x |1  x  3 or x  5
In interval notation: [1,3]  (5, )

Remember when writing or reading interval notation:
Using a square bracket [ means the start value is included in the set
Using a parenthesis ( means the start value is not included in the set

Domain and Range from Graphs
We can also talk about domain and range based on graphs. Since domain refers to the set
of possible input values, the domain of a graph consists of all the input values shown on
the graph. Remember that input values are almost always shown along the horizontal
axis of the graph. Likewise, since range is the set of possible output values, the range of
a graph we can see from the possible values along the vertical axis of the graph.
Be careful – if the graph continues beyond the window on which we can see the graph,
the domain and range might be larger than the values we can see.

Section 1.2 Domain and Range 25
Example 4
Determine the domain and range of the graph below.

In the graph above3, the input quantity along the horizontal axis appears to be “year”,
which we could notate with the variable y. The output is “thousands of barrels of oil per
day”, which we might notate with the variable b, for barrels. The graph would likely
continue to the left and right beyond what is shown, but based on the portion of the
graph that is shown to us, we can determine the domain is 1975  y  2008 , and the
range is approximately 180  b  2010 .
In interval notation, the domain would be [1975, 2008] and the range would be about
[180, 2010]. For the range, we have to approximate the smallest and largest outputs
since they don’t fall exactly on the grid lines.
Remember that, as in the previous example, x and y are not always the input and output
variables. Using descriptive variables is an important tool to remembering the context of
the problem.

Domains and Ranges of the Toolkit functions
We will now return to our set of toolkit functions to note the domain and range of each.
Constant Function: f ( x)  c
The domain here is not restricted; x can be anything. When this is the case we say the
domain is all real numbers. The outputs are limited to the constant value of the function.
Domain: (, )
Range: [c]
Since there is only one output value, we list it by itself in square brackets.
Identity Function: f ( x)  x
Domain: (, )
Range: (, )
Quadratic Function: f ( x)  x 2
Domain: (, )
Range: [0, )
Multiplying a negative or positive number by itself can only yield a positive output.
Cubic Function: f ( x)  x3
Domain: (, )
Range: (, )

Section 1.2 Domain and Range 27

Domain: (,0)  (0, )
Range: (,0)  (0, )
We cannot divide by 0 so we must exclude 0 from the domain.
One divide by any value can never be 0, so the range will not include 0.
Reciprocal: f ( x) 

Reciprocal squared: f ( x) 

x2

Domain: (,0)  (0, )
Range: (0, )
We cannot divide by 0 so we must exclude 0 from the domain.
Cube Root: f ( x)  3 x
Domain: (, )
Range: (, )
Square Root: f ( x)  2 x , commonly just written as, f ( x)  x
Domain: [0, )
Range: [0, )
When dealing with the set of real numbers we cannot take the square root of a negative
number so the domain is limited to 0 or greater.
Absolute Value Function: f ( x)  x
Domain: (, )
Range: [0, )
Since absolute value is defined as a distance from 0, the output can only be greater than
or equal to 0.
Example 4.5
Find the domain of each function: a) f ( x)  2 x  4

b) g ( x) 

3
6  3x

a) Since we cannot take the square root of a negative number, we need the inside of the
square root to be non-negative.
x  4  0 when x  4 .
The domain of f(x) is [4, ) .
b) We cannot divide by zero, so we need the denominator to be non-zero.
6  3x  0 when x = 2, so we must exclude 2 from the domain.
The domain of g(x) is (,2)  (2, ) .

28 Chapter 1
Piecewise Functions
In the toolkit functions we introduced the absolute value function f ( x)  x .
With a domain of all real numbers and a range of values greater than or equal to 0, the
absolute value can be defined as the magnitude or modulus of a number, a real number
value regardless of sign, the size of the number, or the distance from 0 on the number
line. All of these definitions require the output to be greater than or equal to 0.
If we input 0, or a positive value the output is unchanged
f ( x)  x if x  0
If we input a negative value the sign must change from negative to positive.
since multiplying a negative value by -1 makes it positive.
f ( x)   x if x  0
Since this requires two different processes or pieces, the absolute value function is often
called the most basic piecewise defined function.
Piecewise Function
A piecewise function is a function in which the formula used depends upon the domain
the input lies in. We notate this idea like:

A museum charges $5 per person for a guided tour with a group of 1 to 9 people, or a
fixed $50 fee for 10 or more people in the group. Set up a function relating the number
of people, n, to the cost, C.
To set up this function, two different formulas would be needed. C = 5n would work
for n values under 10, and C = 50 would work for values of n ten or greater. Notating

Find the cost of using 1.5 gigabytes of data, and the cost of using 4 gigabytes of data.
To find the cost of using 1.5 gigabytes of data, C(1.5), we first look to see which piece
of domain our input falls in. Since 1.5 is less than 2, we use the first formula, giving
C(1.5) = $25.
The find the cost of using 4 gigabytes of data, C(4), we see that our input of 4 is greater
than 2, so we’ll use the second formula. C(4) = 25 + 10(4-2) = $45.

Since each of the component functions are from our library of Toolkit functions, we
know their shapes. We can imagine graphing each function, then limiting the graph to
the indicated domain. At the endpoints of the domain, we put open circles to indicate
where the endpoint is not included, due to a strictly-less-than inequality, and a closed
circle where the endpoint is included, due to a less-than-or-equal-to inequality.

Now that we have each piece individually, we combine them onto the same graph:

Section 1.3 Rates of Change and Behavior of Graphs
Since functions represent how an output quantity varies with an input quantity, it is
natural to ask about the rate at which the values of the function are changing.
For example, the function C(t) below gives the average cost, in dollars, of a gallon of
gasoline t years after 2000.

If we were interested in how the gas prices had changed between 2002 and 2009, we
could compute that the cost per gallon had increased from $1.47 to $2.14, an increase of
$0.67. While this is interesting, it might be more useful to look at how much the price
changed per year. You are probably noticing that the price didn’t change the same
amount each year, so we would be finding the average rate of change over a specified
amount of time.
The gas price increased by $0.67 from 2002 to 2009, over 7 years, for an average of
$0.67
 0.096 dollars per year. On average, the price of gas increased by about 9.6
7 years
cents each year.
Rate of Change
A rate of change describes how the output quantity changes in relation to the input
quantity. The units on a rate of change are “output units per input units”
Some other examples of rates of change would be quantities like:
 A population of rats increases by 40 rats per week
 A barista earns $9 per hour (dollars per hour)
 A farmer plants 60,000 onions per acre
 A car can drive 27 miles per gallon
 A population of grey whales decreases by 8 whales per year
 The amount of money in your college account decreases by $4,000 per quarter
Average Rate of Change
The average rate of change between two input values is the total change of the
function values (output values) divided by the change in the input values.

2007 and 2009

The input (years) has changed by 2. The output has changed by $2.14 - $2.64 = -0.50.

Graphical Behavior of Functions
As part of exploring how functions change, it is interesting to explore the graphical
behavior of functions.
Increasing/Decreasing
A function is increasing on an interval if the function values increase as the inputs
increase. More formally, a function is increasing if f(b) > f(a) for any two input values
a and b in the interval with b>a. The average rate of change of an increasing function
is positive.
A function is decreasing on an interval if the function values decrease as the inputs
increase. More formally, a function is decreasing if f(b) < f(a) for any two input values
a and b in the interval with b>a. The average rate of change of a decreasing function is
negative.
Example 7
Given the function p(t) graphed here, on what
intervals does the function appear to be
increasing?
The function appears to be increasing from t = 1
to t = 3, and from t = 4 on.
In interval notation, we would say the function
appears to be increasing on the interval (1,3) and
the interval (4, )

Notice in the last example that we used open intervals (intervals that don’t include the
endpoints) since the function is neither increasing nor decreasing at t = 1, 3, or 4.
Local Extrema
A point where a function changes from increasing to decreasing is called a local
maximum.
A point where a function changes from decreasing to increasing is called a local
minimum.
Together, local maxima and minima are called the local extrema, or local extreme
values, of the function.

Section 1.3 Rates of Change and Behavior of Graphs 39

It appears that the cost of gas increased from t = 2 to t = 8. It appears the cost of gas
decreased from t = 8 to t = 9, so the function appears to be decreasing on the interval
(8, 9).
Since the function appears to change from increasing to decreasing at t = 8, there is
local maximum at t = 8.
Example 9
Use a graph to estimate the local extrema of the function f ( x) 

2 x
 . Use these to
x 3

determine the intervals on which the function is increasing.
Using technology to graph the function, it
appears there is a local minimum
somewhere between x = 2 and x =3, and a
symmetric local maximum somewhere
between x = -3 and x = -2.
Most graphing calculators and graphing
utilities can estimate the location of
maxima and minima. Below are screen
images from two different technologies,
showing the estimate for the local maximum and minimum.

Based on these estimates, the function is increasing on the intervals (,2.449) and
(2.449, ) . Notice that while we expect the extrema to be symmetric, the two different
technologies agree only up to 4 decimals due to the differing approximation algorithms
used by each.

4. Use a graph of the function f ( x)  x 3  6 x 2  15x  20 to estimate the local extrema

The total sales, in thousands of dollars, for two companies over 4 weeks are shown.

As you can see, the sales for each company are increasing, but they are increasing in very
different ways. To describe the difference in behavior, we can investigate how the
average rate of change varies over different intervals. Using tables of values,

When the rate of change is getting smaller, as with Company A, we say the function is
concave down. When the rate of change is getting larger, as with Company B, we say
the function is concave up.
Concavity
A function is concave up if the rate of change is increasing.
A function is concave down if the rate of change is decreasing.
A point where a function changes from concave up to concave down or vice versa is
called an inflection point.
Example 10
An object is thrown from the top of a building. The object’s height in feet above
ground after t seconds is given by the function h(t )  144  16t 2 for 0  t  3 . Describe

Estimate from the graph shown the
intervals on which the function is
concave down and concave up.
On the far left, the graph is decreasing
but concave up, since it is bending
upwards. It begins increasing at x = -2,
but it continues to bend upwards until
about x = -1.
From x = -1 the graph starts to bend
downward, and continues to do so until about x = 2. The graph then begins curving
upwards for the remainder of the graph shown.
From this, we can estimate that the graph is concave up on the intervals (,1) and
(2, ) , and is concave down on the interval (1,2) . The graph has inflection points at x
= -1 and x = 2.

Section 1.4 Composition of Functions
Suppose we wanted to calculate how much it costs to heat a house on a particular day of
the year. The cost to heat a house will depend on the average daily temperature, and the
average daily temperature depends on the particular day of the year. Notice how we have
just defined two relationships: The temperature depends on the day, and the cost depends
on the temperature. Using descriptive variables, we can notate these two functions.
The first function, C(T), gives the cost C of heating a house when the average daily
temperature is T degrees Celsius, and the second, T(d), gives the average daily
temperature of a particular city on day d of the year. If we wanted to determine the cost
of heating the house on the 5th day of the year, we could do this by linking our two
functions together, an idea called composition of functions. Using the function T(d), we
could evaluate T(5) to determine the average daily temperature on the 5th day of the year.
We could then use that temperature as the input to the C(T) function to find the cost to
heat the house on the 5th day of the year: C(T(5)).
Composition of Functions
When the output of one function is used as the input of another, we call the entire
operation a composition of functions. We write f(g(x)), and read this as “f of g of x” or
“f composed with g at x”.
An alternate notation for composition uses the composition operator: 
( f  g )( x) is read “f of g of x” or “f composed with g at x”, just like f(g(x)).

Example 1
Suppose c(s) gives the number of calories burned doing s sit-ups, and s(t) gives the
number of sit-ups a person can do in t minutes. Interpret c(s(3)).
When we are asked to interpret, we are being asked to explain the meaning of the
expression in words. The inside expression in the composition is s(3). Since the input
to the s function is time, the 3 is representing 3 minutes, and s(3) is the number of situps that can be done in 3 minutes. Taking this output and using it as the input to the
c(s) function will gives us the calories that can be burned by the number of sit-ups that
can be done in 3 minutes.
Note that it is not important that the same variable be used for the output of the inside
function and the input to the outside function. However, it is essential that the units on
the output of the inside function match the units on the input to the outside function, if the
units are specified.

50 Chapter 1
Example 2
Suppose f(x) gives miles that can be driven in x hours, and g(y) gives the gallons of gas
used in driving y miles. Which of these expressions is meaningful: f(g(y)) or g(f(x))?
The expression g(y) takes miles as the input and outputs a number of gallons. The
function f(x) is expecting a number of hours as the input; trying to give it a number of
gallons as input does not make sense. Remember the units have to match, and number
of gallons does not match number of hours, so the expression f(g(y)) is meaningless.
The expression f(x) takes hours as input and outputs a number of miles driven. The
function g(y) is expecting a number of miles as the input, so giving the output of the f(x)
function (miles driven) as an input value for g(y), where gallons of gas depends on
miles driven, does make sense. The expression g(f(x)) makes sense, and will give the
number of gallons of gas used, g, driving a certain number of miles, f(x), in x hours.

1. In a department store you see a sign that says 50% off of clearance merchandise, so
final cost C depends on the clearance price, p, according to the function C(p). Clearance
price, p, depends on the original discount, d, given to the clearance item, p(d).
Interpret C(p(d)).
Composition of Functions using Tables and Graphs
When working with functions given as tables and graphs, we can look up values for the
functions using a provided table or graph, as discussed in section 1.1. We start evaluation
from the provided input, and first evaluate the inside function. We can then use the
output of the inside function as the input to the outside function. To remember this,
always work from the inside out.

To evaluate f ( g (3)) , we start from the inside with the value 3. We then evaluate the
inside expression g (3) using the table that defines the function g: g (3)  2 . We can then
use that result as the input to the f function, so g (3) is replaced by the equivalent value 2
and we get f (2) . Then using the table that defines the function f, we find that f (2)  8 .
f ( g (3))  f (2)  8 .

Section 1.4 Composition of Functions 51
To evaluate g ( f (4)) , we first evaluate the inside expression f (4) using the first table:
f (4)  1. Then using the table for g we can evaluate:
g ( f (4))  g (1)  3

2. Using the tables from the example above, evaluate f ( g (1)) and g ( f (3)) .

Example 4
Using the graphs below, evaluate f ( g (1)) .
g(x)

f(x)

To evaluate f ( g (1)) , we again start with the inside evaluation. We evaluate g (1) using
the graph of the g(x) function, finding the input of 1 on the horizontal axis and finding
the output value of the graph at that input. Here, g (1)  3 . Using this value as the input
to the f function, f ( g (1))  f (3) . We can then evaluate this by looking to the graph of
the f(x) function, finding the input of 3 on the horizontal axis, and reading the output
value of the graph at this input. Here, f (3)  6 , so f ( g (1))  6 .

Try it Now
3. Using the graphs from the previous example, evaluate g ( f (2)) .

Composition using Formulas
When evaluating a composition of functions where we have either created or been given
formulas, the concept of working from the inside out remains the same. First we evaluate
the inside function using the input value provided, then use the resulting output as the
input to the outside function.

52 Chapter 1
Example 5
Given f (t )  t 2  t and h( x)  3x  2 , evaluate f (h(1)) .
Since the inside evaluation is h(1) we start by evaluating the h(x) function at 1:
h(1)  3(1)  2  5
Then f (h(1))  f (5) , so we evaluate the f(t) function at an input of 5:
f (h(1))  f (5)  5 2  5  20

Try it Now
4. Using the functions from the example above, evaluate h( f (2)) .

While we can compose the functions as above for each individual input value, sometimes
it would be really helpful to find a single formula which will calculate the result of a
composition f(g(x)). To do this, we will extend our idea of function evaluation. Recall
that when we evaluate a function like f (t )  t 2  t , we put whatever value is inside the
parentheses after the function name into the formula wherever we see the input variable.
Example 6
Given f (t )  t 2  t , evaluate f (3) and f (2) .

f (3)  32  3
f (2)  (2) 2  (2)
We could simplify the results above if we wanted to
f (3)  32  3  9  3  6
f (2)  (2)2  (2)  4  2  6

We are not limited, however, to using a numerical value as the input to the function. We
can put anything into the function: a value, a different variable, or even an algebraic
expression, provided we use the input expression everywhere we see the input variable.
Example 7
Using the function from the previous example, evaluate f(a)
This means that the input value for t is some unknown quantity a. As before, we
evaluate by replacing the input variable t with the input quantity, in this case a.
f (a)  a 2  a

Section 1.4 Composition of Functions 53
The same idea can then be applied to expressions more complicated than a single letter.
Example 8
Using the same f(t) function from above, evaluate f ( x  2) .
Everywhere in the formula for f where there was a t, we would replace it with the input
( x  2) . Since in the original formula the input t was squared in the first term, the entire
input x  2 needs to be squared when we substitute, so we need to use grouping
parentheses. To avoid problems, it is advisable to always use parentheses around
inputs.

f ( x  2)  ( x  2) 2  ( x  2)
We could simplify this expression further to f ( x  2)  x 2  3x  2 if we wanted to:
Use the “FOIL” technique (first, outside, inside, last)
f ( x  2)  ( x  2)( x  2)  ( x  2)

f ( x  2)  x2  2 x  2 x  4  ( x  2)
f ( x  2)  x2  2 x  2 x  4  x  2
f ( x  2)  x 2  3x  2

distribute the negative sign
combine like terms

Example 9
Using the same function, evaluate f (t 3 ) .
Note that in this example, the same variable is used in the input expression and as the
input variable of the function. This doesn’t matter – we still replace the original input t
in the formula with the new input expression, t 3 .
f (t 3 )  (t 3 ) 2  (t 3 )  t 6  t 3

Try it Now
5. Given g ( x)  3x  x , evaluate g (t  2) .

This now allows us to find an expression for a composition of functions. If we want to
find a formula for f(g(x)), we can start by writing out the formula for g(x). We can then
evaluate the function f(x) at that expression, as in the examples above.

Example 11
A city manager determines that the tax revenue, R, in millions of dollars collected on a
population of p thousand people is given by the formula R( p)  0.03 p  p , and that
the city’s population, in thousands, is predicted to follow the formula
p(t )  60  2t  0.3t 2 , where t is measured in years after 2010. Find a formula for the
tax revenue as a function of the year.
Since we want tax revenue as a function of the year, we want year to be our initial input,
and revenue to be our final output. To find revenue, we will first have to predict the
city population, and then use that result as the input to the tax function. So we need to
find R(p(t)). Evaluating this,

Section 1.4 Composition of Functions 55









R( p(t ))  R 60  2t  0.3t 2  0.03 60  2t  0.3t 2  60  2t  0.3t 2
This composition gives us a single formula which can be used to predict the tax revenue
during a given year, without needing to find the intermediary population value.
For example, to predict the tax revenue in 2017, when t = 7 (because t is measured in
years after 2010)





R( p(7))  0.03 60  2(7)  0.3(7) 2  60  2(7)  0.3(7) 2  12.079 million dollars

In some cases, it is desirable to decompose a function – to write it as a composition of
two simpler functions.
Example 12
Write f ( x)  3  5  x 2 as the composition of two functions.
We are looking for two functions, g and h, so f ( x)  g (h( x)) . To do this, we look for a
function inside a function in the formula for f(x). As one possibility, we might notice
that 5  x 2 is the inside of the square root. We could then decompose the function as:
h( x)  5  x 2
g ( x)  3  x

We can check our answer by recomposing the functions:





g (h( x))  g 5  x 2  3  5  x 2
Note that this is not the only solution to the problem. Another non-trivial
decomposition would be h( x)  x 2 and g ( x)  3  5  x

Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 61

Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions
Often when given a problem, we try to model the scenario using mathematics in the form
of words, tables, graphs and equations in order to explain or solve it. When building
models, it is often helpful to build off of existing formulas or models. Knowing the basic
graphs of your tool-kit functions can help you solve problems by being able to model
new behavior by adapting something you already know. Unfortunately, the models and
existing formulas we know are not always exactly the same as the ones presented in the
problems we face.
Fortunately, there are systematic ways to shift, stretch, compress, flip and combine
functions to help them become better models for the problems we are trying to solve. We
can transform what we already know into what we need, hence the name,
“Transformation of functions.” When we have a story problem, formula, graph, or table,
we can then transform that function in a variety of ways to form new functions.
Shifts
Example 1
To regulate temperature in our green building, air flow vents near the roof open and
close throughout the day to allow warm air to escape. The graph below shows the open
vents V (in square feet) throughout the day, t in hours after midnight. During the
summer, the facilities staff decides to try to better regulate temperature by increasing
the amount of open vents by 20 square feet throughout the day. Sketch a graph of this
new function.

We can sketch a graph of this new function by adding 20 to each of the output values of
the original function. This will have the effect of shifting the graph up.

62 Chapter 1
Notice that in the second graph, for each
input value, the output value has
increased by twenty, so if we call the
new function S(t), we could write
S (t )  V (t )  20 .
Note that this notation tells us that for
any value of t, S(t) can be found by
evaluating the V function at the same
input, then adding twenty to the result.
This defines S as a transformation of the
function V, in this case a vertical shift
up 20 units.
Notice that with a vertical shift the input values stay the same and only the output
values change.
Vertical Shift
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as
g ( x)  f ( x)  k , where k is a constant
then g(x) is a vertical shift of the function f(x), where all the output values have been
increased by k.
If k is positive, then the graph will shift up
If k is negative, then the graph will shift down
Example 2
A function f(x) is given as a table below. Create a table for the function g ( x)  f ( x)  3

The formula g ( x)  f ( x)  3 tells us that we can find the output values of the g function
by subtracting 3 from the output values of the f function. For example,
is found from the given table
f (2)  1
is our given transformation
g ( x)  f ( x)  3
g (2)  f (2)  3  1  3  2
Subtracting 3 from each f(x) value, we can complete a table of values for g(x)

As with the earlier vertical shift, notice the input values stay the same and only the output
values change.
Try it Now
1. The function h(t )  4.9t 2  30t gives the height h of a ball (in meters) thrown
upwards from the ground after t seconds. Suppose the ball was instead thrown from the
top of a 10 meter building. Relate this new height function b(t) to h(t), then find a
formula for b(t).
The vertical shift is a change to the output, or outside, of the function. We will now look
at how changes to input, on the inside of the function, change its graph and meaning.
Example 3
Returning to our building air flow example from the beginning of the section, suppose
that in Fall, the facilities staff decides that the original venting plan starts too late, and
they want to move the entire venting program to start two hours earlier. Sketch a graph
of the new function.
V(t) = the original venting plan

F(t) = starting 2 hrs sooner

In the new graph, which we can call F(t), at each time, the air flow is the same as the
original function V(t) was two hours later. For example, in the original function V, the
air flow starts to change at 8am, while for the function F(t) the air flow starts to change
at 6am. The comparable function values are V (8)  F (6) .
Notice also that the vents first opened to 220 sq. ft. at 10 a.m. under the original plan,
while under the new plan the vents reach 220 sq. ft. at 8 a.m., so V (10)  F (8) .
In both cases we see that since F(t) starts 2 hours sooner, the same output values are
reached when, F (t )  V (t  2)
Note that V (t  2) had the affect of shifting the graph to the left.

64 Chapter 1
Horizontal changes or “inside changes” affect the domain of a function (the input) instead
of the range and often seem counterintuitive. The new function F(t) uses the same
outputs as V(t), but matches those outputs to inputs two hours earlier than those of V(t).
Said another way, we must add 2 hours to the input of V to find the corresponding output
for F: F (t )  V (t  2) .

Horizontal Shift
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as
g ( x)  f ( x  k ) , where k is a constant
then g(x) is a horizontal shift of the function f(x)
If k is positive, then the graph will shift left
If k is negative, then the graph will shift right
Example 4
A function f(x) is given as a table below. Create a table for the function g ( x)  f ( x  3)

The formula g ( x)  f ( x  3) tells us that the output values of g are the same as the
output value of f with an input value three smaller. For example, we know that f (2)  1 .
To get the same output from the g function, we will need an input value that is 3 larger:
We input a value that is three larger for g(x) because the function takes three away
before evaluating the function f.
g (5)  f (5  3)  f (2)  1

The result is that the function g(x) has been shifted to the right by 3. Notice the output
values for g(x) remain the same as the output values for f(x) in the chart, but the
corresponding input values, x, have shifted to the right by 3: 2 shifted to 5, 4 shifted to
7, 6 shifted to 9 and 8 shifted to 11.

Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 65

Example 5
The graph shown is a transformation of the toolkit
function f ( x)  x 2 . Relate this new function g(x)
to f(x), and then find a formula for g(x).
Notice that the graph looks almost identical in
shape to the f ( x)  x 2 function, but the x values
are shifted to the right two units. The vertex used
to be at (0, 0) but now the vertex is at (2, 0) . The
graph is the basic quadratic function shifted two to
the right, so
g ( x)  f ( x  2)
Notice how we must input the value x = 2, to get the output value y = 0; the x values
must be two units larger, because of the shift to the right by 2 units.
We can then use the definition of the f(x) function to write a formula for g(x) by
evaluating f ( x  2) :
Since f ( x)  x 2 and g ( x)  f ( x  2)

g ( x)  f ( x  2)  ( x  2)2
If you find yourself having trouble determining whether the shift is +2 or -2, it might
help to consider a single point on the graph. For a quadratic, looking at the bottommost point is convenient. In the original function, f (0)  0 . In our shifted function,
g (2)  0 . To obtain the output value of 0 from the f function, we need to decide
whether a +2 or -2 will work to satisfy g (2)  f (2 ? 2)  f (0)  0 . For this to work, we
will need to subtract 2 from our input values.
When thinking about horizontal and vertical shifts, it is good to keep in mind that vertical
shifts are affecting the output values of the function, while horizontal shifts are affecting
the input values of the function.
Example 6
The function G(m) gives the number of gallons of gas required to drive m miles.
Interpret G(m)  10 and G(m  10)
G(m)  10 is adding 10 to the output, gallons. So this is 10 gallons of gas more than is
required to drive m miles. So this is the gas required to drive m miles, plus another 10
gallons of gas.
G(m  10) is adding 10 to the input, miles. So this is the number of gallons of gas
required to drive 10 miles more than m miles.

2. Given the function f ( x)  x graph the original function f (x) and the
transformation g ( x)  f ( x  2) .
a. Is this a horizontal or a vertical change?
b. Which way is the graph shifted and by how many units?
c. Graph f(x) and g(x) on the same axes.
Now that we have two transformations, we can combine them together.
Remember:
Vertical Shifts are outside changes that affect the output (vertical) axis values shifting the
transformed function up or down.
Horizontal Shifts are inside changes that affect the input (horizontal) axis values shifting
the transformed function left or right.
Example 7
Given f ( x)  x , sketch a graph of h( x)  f ( x  1)  3 .
The function f is our toolkit absolute value function. We know that this graph has a V
shape, with the point at the origin. The graph of h has transformed f in two ways:
f ( x  1) is a change on the inside of the function, giving a horizontal shift left by 1,
then the subtraction by 3 in f ( x  1)  3 is a change to the outside of the function,
giving a vertical shift down by 3. Transforming the graph gives

We could also find a formula for this transformation by evaluating the expression for
h(x):
h( x)  f ( x  1)  3

h( x )  x  1  3

Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 67
Example 8
Write a formula for the graph shown, a
transformation of the toolkit square root function.
The graph of the toolkit function starts at the
origin, so this graph has been shifted 1 to the right,
and up 2. In function notation, we could write that
as h( x)  f ( x  1)  2 . Using the formula for the
square root function we can write
h( x)  x  1  2
Note that this transformation has changed the
domain and range of the function. This new graph
has domain [1, ) and range [2, ) .

Reflections
Another transformation that can be applied to a function is a reflection over the horizontal
or vertical axis.
Example 9
Reflect the graph of s(t )  t both vertically and horizontally.
Reflecting the graph vertically, each output value will be reflected over the horizontal t
axis:

Since each output value is the opposite of the original output value, we can write
V (t )  s(t )
V (t )   t
Notice this is an outside change or vertical change that affects the output s(t) values so
the negative sign belongs outside of the function.

68 Chapter 1
Reflecting horizontally, each input value will be reflected over the vertical axis:

Since each input value is the opposite of the original input value, we can write
H (t )  s(t )
H (t )  t
Notice this is an inside change or horizontal change that affects the input values so the
negative sign is on the inside of the function.

Note that these transformations can affect the domain and range of the functions. While
the original square root function has domain [0, ) and range [0, ) , the vertical
reflection gives the V(t) function the range (, 0] , and the horizontal reflection gives
the H(t) function the domain (, 0] .

Reflections
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as
g ( x)   f ( x ) ,
then g(x) is a vertical reflection of the function f(x), sometimes called a reflection
about the x-axis
If we define a new function g(x) as
g ( x)  f (  x ) ,
then g(x) is a horizontal reflection of the function f(x), sometimes called a reflection
about the y-axis
Example 10
A function f(x) is given as a table below. Create a table for the function g ( x)   f ( x)

Example 11
A common model for learning has an equation similar to
k (t )  2t  1, where k is the percentage of mastery that
can be achieved after t practice sessions. This is a
transformation of the function f (t )  2t shown here.
Sketch a graph of k(t).
This equation combines three transformations into one equation.
A horizontal reflection:

f (t )  2t

A vertical reflection:

 f (t )  2

A vertical shift up 1:

We can sketch a graph by applying these transformations one at a time to the original
function:

Horizontally reflected
Then vertically reflected

Then, after shifting up 1, we get the final graph:

70 Chapter 1

k (t )   f (t )  1  2t  1.
Note: As a model for learning, this function would be limited to a domain of t  0 ,
with corresponding range [0,1) .

Try it Now
3. Given the toolkit function f ( x)  x 2 , graph g(x) = -f(x) and h(x) = f(-x).
Do you notice anything surprising? Discuss your findings with a friend.
Some functions exhibit symmetry, in which reflections result in the original graph. For
example, reflecting the toolkit functions f ( x)  x 2 or f ( x)  x about the y-axis will
result in the original graph. We call these types of graphs symmetric about the y-axis.
Likewise, if the graphs of f ( x)  x3 or f ( x) 

1
were reflected over both axes, the
x

result would be the original graph:

f ( x)  x 3

f (  x)

We call these graphs symmetric about the origin.

 f (  x)

Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 71
Even and Odd Functions
A function is called an even function if
f ( x)  f (  x)
The graph of an even function is symmetric about the vertical axis
A function is called an odd function if
f ( x)   f (  x)
The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin
Note: A function can be neither even nor odd if it does not exhibit either symmetry. For
example, the f ( x)  2 x function is neither even nor odd.

Example 12
Is the function f ( x)  x3  2 x even, odd, or neither?
Without looking at a graph, we can determine this by finding formulas for the
reflections, and seeing if they return us to the original function:

f ( x)  ( x)3  2( x)   x3  2 x
This does not return us to the original function, so this function is not even. We can
now try also applying a horizontal reflection:
 f (  x)     x 3  2 x   x 3  2 x
Since  f ( x)  f ( x) , this is an odd function

Stretches and Compressions
With shifts, we saw the effect of adding or subtracting to the inputs or outputs of a
function. We now explore the effects of multiplying the inputs or outputs.
Remember, we can transform the inside (input values) of a function or we can transform
the outside (output values) of a function. Each change has a specific effect that can be
seen graphically.

72 Chapter 1
Example 13
A function P(t) models the growth of a population of fruit flies. The growth is shown
below.

A scientist is comparing this to another population, Q, that grows the same way, but
starts twice as large. Sketch a graph of this population.
Since the population is always twice as large, the new population’s output values are
always twice the original function output values. Graphically, this would look like

Symbolically,
Q(t )  2P(t )
This means that for any input t, the value of the Q function is twice the value of the P
function. Notice the effect on the graph is a vertical stretching of the graph, where
every point doubles its distance from the horizontal axis. The input values, t, stay the
same while the output values are twice as large as before.
Vertical Stretch/Compression
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as
g ( x)  kf ( x) , where k is a constant
then g(x) is a vertical stretch or compression of the function f(x).
If k > 1, then the graph will be stretched
If 0< k < 1, then the graph will be compressed
If k < 0, then there will be combination of a vertical stretch or compression with a
vertical reflection

The result is that the function g(x) has been compressed vertically by ½. Each output
value has been cut in half, so the graph would now be half the original height.
Example 15
The graph to the right is a transformation of the
toolkit function f ( x)  x 3 . Relate this new function
g(x) to f(x), then find a formula for g(x).
When trying to determine a vertical stretch or shift, it
is helpful to look for a point on the graph that is
relatively clear. In this graph, it appears that
g (2)  2 . With the basic cubic function at the same
input, f (2)  2 3  8 . Based on that, it appears that
the outputs of g are ¼ the outputs of the function f,
1
since g (2)  f (2) . From this we can fairly safely
4
conclude that:

g ( x)  f ( x)

We can write a formula for g by using the definition of the function f

74 Chapter 1
Example 16
Returning to the fruit fly population we looked at earlier, suppose the scientist is now
comparing it to a population that progresses through its lifespan twice as fast as the
original population. In other words, this new population, R, will progress in 1 hour the
same amount the original population did in 2 hours, and in 2 hours, will progress as
much as the original population did in 4 hours. Sketch a graph of this population.
Symbolically, we could write
R(1)  P(2)
R(2)  P(4) , and in general,
R(t )  P(2t )
Graphing this,
Original population, P(t)

Transformed, R(t)

Note the effect on the graph is a horizontal compression, where all input values are half
their original distance from the vertical axis.
Horizontal Stretch/Compression
Given a function f(x), if we define a new function g(x) as
g ( x)  f (kx) , where k is a constant
then g(x) is a horizontal stretch or compression of the function f(x).
If k > 1, then the graph will be compressed by 1

k

If 0< k < 1, then the graph will be stretched by
k
If k < 0, then there will be combination of a horizontal stretch or compression with a
horizontal reflection.

The formula g ( x)  f  x  tells us that the output values for g are the same as the

output values for the function f at an input half the size. Notice that we don’t have
1 
enough information to determine g (2) since g (2)  f   2   f (1) , and we do not
2 
have a value for f (1) in our table. Our input values to g will need to be twice as large
to get inputs for f that we can evaluate. For example, we can determine g (4) since

Since each input value has been doubled, the result is that the function g(x) has been
stretched horizontally by 2.
Example 18
Two graphs are shown below. Relate the function g(x) to f(x)
f(x)

g(x)

The graph of g(x) looks like the graph of f(x) horizontally compressed. Since f(x) ends at
(6,4) and g(x) ends at (2,4) we can see that the x values have been compressed by 1/3,
because 6(1/3) = 2. We might also notice that g (2)  f 6 , and g (1)  f 3 . Either
way, we can describe this relationship as g ( x)  f 3x  . This is a horizontal
compression by 1/3.

76 Chapter 1
Notice that the coefficient needed for a horizontal stretch or compression is the
reciprocal of the stretch or compression. So to stretch the graph horizontally by 4, we
1 
need a coefficient of 1/4 in our function: f  x  . This means the input values must be
4 
four times larger to produce the same result, requiring the input to be larger, causing the
horizontal stretching.

4. Write a formula for the toolkit square root function horizontally stretched by three.
It is useful to note that for most toolkit functions, a horizontal stretch or vertical stretch
can be represented in other ways. For example, a horizontal compression of the function
2
f  x   x 2 by ½ would result in a new function g  x    2 x  , but this can also be written
as g  x   4 x 2 , a vertical stretch of f(x) by 4. When writing a formula for a transformed
toolkit, we only need to find one transformation that would produce the graph.
Combining Transformations
When combining transformations, it is very important to consider the order of the
transformations. For example, vertically shifting by 3 and then vertically stretching by 2
does not create the same graph as vertically stretching by 2 and then vertically shifting by
3.
When we see an expression like 2 f ( x)  3 , which transformation should we start with?
The answer here follows nicely from order of operations, for outside transformations.
Given the output value of f(x), we first multiply by 2, causing the vertical stretch, then
add 3, causing the vertical shift. (Multiplication before Addition)
Combining Vertical Transformations
When combining vertical transformations written in the form af ( x)  k ,
first vertically stretch by a, then vertically shift by k.
Horizontal transformations are a little trickier to think about. When we write
g ( x)  f (2 x  3) for example, we have to think about how the inputs to the g function
relate to the inputs to the f function. Suppose we know f (7)  12 . What input to g
would produce that output? In other words, what value of x will allow
g ( x)  f (2 x  3)  f (12) ? We would need 2 x  3  12 . To solve for x, we would first
subtract 3, resulting in horizontal shift, then divide by 2, causing a horizontal
compression.

Section 1.5 Transformation of Functions 77
Combining Horizontal Transformations
When combining horizontal transformations written in the form f (bx  p) ,
first horizontally shift by p, then horizontally stretch by 1/b.
This format ends up being very difficult to work with, since it is usually much easier to
horizontally stretch a graph before shifting. We can work around this by factoring inside
the function.
 
p 
f (bx  p) = f  b x   
b 
 
Factoring in this way allows us to horizontally stretch first, then shift horizontally.
Combining Horizontal Transformations (Factored Form)
When combining horizontal transformations written in the form f (b( x  h)) ,
first horizontally stretch by 1/b, then horizontally shift by h.
Independence of Horizontal and Vertical Transformations
Horizontal and vertical transformations are independent. It does not matter
whether horizontal or vertical transformations are done first.

There are 3 steps to this transformation and we will work from the inside out. Starting
with the horizontal transformations, f (3x) is a horizontal compression by 1/3, which
means we multiply each x value by 1/3.

By factoring the inside, we can first horizontally stretch by 2, as indicated by the ½ on
the inside of the function. Remember twice the size of 0 is still 0, so the point (0,2)
remains at (0,2) while the point (2,0) will stretch to (4,0).
Next, we horizontally shift left by 2 units, as indicated by the x+2.
Last, we vertically shift down by 3 to complete our sketch, as indicated by the -3 on the
outside of the function.

Example 21
Write an equation for the transformed graph of
the quadratic function shown.
Since this is a quadratic function, first consider
what the basic quadratic tool kit function looks
like and how this has changed. Observing the
graph, we notice several transformations:
The original tool kit function has been flipped
over the x axis, some kind of stretch or
compression has occurred, and we can see a shift
to the right 3 units and a shift up 1 unit.
In total there are four operations:
Vertical reflection, requiring a negative sign outside the function
Vertical Stretch or Horizontal Compression*
Horizontal Shift Right 3 units, which tells us to put x-3 on the inside of the function
Vertical Shift up 1 unit, telling us to add 1 on the outside of the function
*

It is unclear from the graph whether it is showing a vertical stretch or a horizontal
compression. For the quadratic, it turns out we could represent it either way, so we’ll
use a vertical stretch. You may be able to determine the vertical stretch by observation.
By observation, the basic tool kit function has a vertex at (0, 0) and symmetrical points
at (1, 1) and (-1, 1). These points are one unit up and one unit over from the vertex.
The new points on the transformed graph are one unit away horizontally but 2 units
away vertically. They have been stretched vertically by two.
Not everyone can see this by simply looking at the graph. If you can, great, but if not,
we can solve for it. First, we will write the equation for this graph, with an unknown
vertical stretch.

f ( x)  x 2
 f ( x)   x 2
 af ( x)  ax 2
 af ( x  3)  a( x  3) 2
 af ( x  3)  1  a( x  3) 2  1

The original function
Vertically reflected
Vertically stretched
Shifted right 3
Shifted up 1

We now know our graph is going to have an equation of the form g ( x)  a( x  3) 2  1.
To find the vertical stretch, we can identify any point on the graph (other than the
highest point), such as the point (2,-1), which tells us g (2)  1 . Using our general
formula, and substituting 2 for x, and -1 for g(x)

80 Chapter 1

 1  a(2  3) 2  1
 1  a  1
 2  a
2a
This tells us that to produce the graph we need a vertical stretch by two.
The function that produces this graph is therefore g ( x)  2( x  3) 2  1.

The basic reciprocal squared function is increasing on
(,0) and decreasing on (0, ) . Because of the vertical
flip, the g(x) function will be decreasing on the left and
increasing on the right. The horizontal shift right by 1 will
also shift these intervals to the right one. From this, we can
determine g(x) will be increasing on (1, ) and decreasing on
(,1) . We also could graph the transformation to help us
determine these intervals.

Section 1.6 Inverse Functions
A fashion designer is travelling to Milan for a fashion show. He asks his assistant, Betty,
what 75 degrees Fahrenheit is in Celsius, and after a quick search on Google, she finds
5
5
the formula C  ( F  32) . Using this formula, she calculates (75  32)  24 degrees
9
9
Celsius. The next day, the designer sends his assistant the week’s weather forecast for
Milan, and asks her to convert the temperatures to Fahrenheit.

At first, Betty might consider using the formula she has already found to do the
conversions. After all, she knows her algebra, and can easily solve the equation for F
after substituting a value for C. For example, to convert 26 degrees Celsius, she could
write:
5
26  ( F  32)
9
9
26   F  32
5
9
F  26   32  79
5
After considering this option for a moment, she realizes that solving the equation for each
of the temperatures would get awfully tedious, and realizes that since evaluation is easier
than solving, it would be much more convenient to have a different formula, one which
takes the Celsius temperature and outputs the Fahrenheit temperature. This is the idea of
an inverse function, where the input becomes the output and the output becomes the
input.
Inverse Function
If f (a)  b , then a function g(x) is an inverse of f if g (b)  a .
The inverse of f(x) is typically notated f 1 ( x) , which is read “f inverse of x”, so
equivalently, if f (a)  b then f 1 (b)  a .
Important: The raised -1 used in the notation for inverse functions is simply a notation,
and does not designate an exponent or power of -1.

Section 1.6 Inverse Functions 91
Example 1
If for a particular function, f (2)  4 , what do we know about the inverse?
The inverse function reverses which quantity is input and which quantity is output, so if
f (2)  4 , then f 1 (4)  2 .
Alternatively, if you want to re-name the inverse function g(x), then g(4) = 2
Try it Now
1. Given that h 1 (6)  2 , what do we know about the original function h(x)?
Notice that original function and the inverse function undo each other. If f (a)  b , then
f 1 (b)  a , returning us to the original input. More simply put, if you compose these
functions together you get the original input as your answer.
f 1  f (a)   a and f  f 1 (b)   b

( x)

Since the outputs of the function f are the inputs to f 1 , the range of f is also the domain
of f 1 . Likewise, since the inputs to f are the outputs of f 1 , the domain of f is the
range of f 1 .
Basically, like how the input and output values switch, the domain & ranges switch as
well. But be careful, because sometimes a function doesn’t even have an inverse
function, or only has an inverse on a limited domain. For example, the inverse of
f ( x)  x is f 1 ( x)  x 2 , since a square “undoes” a square root, but it is only the
inverse of f(x) on the domain [0,∞), since that is the range of f ( x)  x .

Example 2
The function f ( x)  2 x has domain (, ) and range (0, ) , what would we expect
the domain and range of f 1 to be?
We would expect f 1 to swap the domain and range of f, so f
domain (0, ) and range (, ) .

The inverse function takes an output of f and returns an input for f. So in the
expression f 1 (70) , the 70 is an output value of the original function, representing 70
miles. The inverse will return the corresponding input of the original function f, 90
minutes, so f 1 (70)  90 . Interpreting this, it means that to drive 70 miles, it took 90
minutes.
Alternatively, recall the definition of the inverse was that if f (a)  b then f 1 (b)  a .
By this definition, if you are given f 1 (70)  a then you are looking for a value a so
that f (a)  70 . In this case, we are looking for a t so that f (t )  70 , which is when t =

output value 3 on the vertical axis we find the point (5, 3) on the graph, which means
g(5) = 3, so by definition g 1 (3)  5 .

It is important to note that not all functions will have an inverse function. Since the
inverse f 1 ( x) takes an output of f and returns an input of f, in order for f 1 to itself be
a function, then each output of f (input to f 1 ) must correspond to exactly one input of f
(output of f 1 ) in order for f 1 to be a function. You might recall that this is the
definition of a one-to-one function.

94 Chapter 1
Properties of Inverses
In order for a function to have an inverse, it must be a one-to-one function.
In some cases, it is desirable to have an inverse for a function even though the function is
not one-to-one. In those cases, we can often limit the domain of the original function to
an interval on which the function is one-to-one, then find an inverse only on that interval.
If you have not already done so, go back to the toolkit functions that were not one-to-one
and limit or restrict the domain of the original function so that it is one-to-one. If you are
not sure how to do this, proceed to Example 6.
Example 6
The quadratic function h( x)  x 2 is not one-to-one. Find a domain on which this
function is one-to-one, and find the inverse on that domain.
We can limit the domain to [0, ) to restrict the
graph to a portion that is one-to-one, and find an
inverse on this limited domain.
You may have already guessed that since we undo a
square with a square root, the inverse of h( x)  x 2
on this domain is h 1 ( x)  x .
You can also solve for the inverse function algebraically. If h( x)  x 2 , we can
introduce the variable y to represent the output values, allowing us to write y  x 2 . To
find the inverse we solve for the input variable
To solve for x we take the square root of each side.

y  x 2 and get

y  x , so

x   y . We have restricted x to being non-negative, so we’ll use the positive square
root, x 

y or h 1 ( y) 

y . In cases like this where the variables are not descriptive,

it is common to see the inverse function rewritten with the variable x: h 1 ( x)  x .
Rewriting the inverse using the variable x is often required for graphing inverse
functions using calculators or computers.
h(x)

Note that the domain and range of the square root function
do correspond with the range and domain of the quadratic
function on the limited domain. In fact, if we graph h(x) on
the restricted domain and h 1 ( x) on the same axes, we can
notice symmetry: the graph of h 1 ( x) is the graph of h(x)
reflected over the line y = x.

y=x

h 1 ( x)

Example 7
Given the graph of f(x) shown, sketch a graph of f

This is a one-to-one function, so we will be able to sketch an
inverse. Note that the graph shown has an apparent domain
of (0,∞) and range of (-∞,∞), so the inverse will have a
domain of (-∞,∞) and range of (0,∞).
Reflecting this graph of the line y = x, the point (1, 0) reflects
to (0, 1), and the point (4, 2) reflects to (2, 4). Sketching the

Chapter 2: Linear Functions
Chapter one was a window that gave us a peek into the entire course. Our goal was to
understand the basic structure of functions and function notation, the toolkit functions,
domain and range, how to recognize and understand composition and transformations of
functions and how to understand and utilize inverse functions. With these basic
components in hand we will further research the specific details and intricacies of each
type of function in our toolkit and use them to model the world around us.
Mathematical Modeling
As we approach day to day life we often need to quantify the things around us, giving
structure and numeric value to various situations. This ability to add structure enables us
to make choices based on patterns we see that are weighted and systematic. With this
structure in place we can model and even predict behavior to make decisions. Adding a
numerical structure to a real world situation is called Mathematical Modeling.
When modeling real world scenarios, there are some common growth patterns that are
regularly observed. We will devote this chapter and the rest of the book to the study of
the functions used to model these growth patterns.

Section 2.1 Linear Functions
As you hop into a taxicab in Las Vegas, the meter will immediately read $3.30; this is the
“drop” charge made when the taximeter is activated. After that initial fee, the taximeter
will add $2.40 for each mile the taxi drives1. In this scenario, the total taxi fare depends
upon the number of miles ridden in the taxi, and we can ask whether it is possible to
model this type of scenario with a function. Using descriptive variables, we choose m for
miles and C for Cost in dollars as a function of miles: C(m).
We know for certain that C (0)  3.30 , since the $3.30 drop charge is assessed regardless
of how many miles are driven. Since $2.40 is added for each mile driven, then
C (1)  3.30  2.40  5.70
If we then drove a second mile, another $2.40 would be added to the cost:
C(2)  3.30  2.40  2.40  3.30  2.40(2)  8.10

http://taxi.state.nv.us/FaresFees.htm, retrieved July 28, 2010. There is also a waiting fee assessed when
the taxi is waiting at red lights, but we’ll ignore that in this discussion.

100 Chapter 2
If we drove a third mile, another $2.40 would be added
to the cost:
C(3)  3.30  2.40  2.40  2.40  3.30  2.40(3)  10.50

From this we might observe the pattern, and conclude
that if m miles are driven, C (m)  3.30  2.40m
because we start with a $3.30 drop fee and then for
each mile increase we add $2.40.
It is good to verify that the units make sense in this equation. The $3.30 drop charge is
measured in dollars; the $2.40 charge is measured in dollars per mile. So
dollars 

C (m)  3.30dollars   2.40
m miles 
mile 

When dollars per mile are multiplied by a number of miles, the result is a number of
dollars, matching the units on the 3.30, and matching the desired units for the C function.
Notice this equation C (m)  3.30  2.40m consisted of two quantities. The first is the
fixed $3.30 charge which does not change based on the value of the input. The second is
the $2.40 dollars per mile value, which is a rate of change. In the equation this rate of
change is multiplied by the input value.
Looking at this same problem in table format we can also see the cost changes by $2.40
for every 1 mile increase.
m

It is important here to note that in this equation, the rate of change is constant; over any
interval, the rate of change is the same.
Graphing this equation, C (m)  3.30  2.40m we see the shape is a line, which is how
these functions get their name: linear functions
When the number of miles is zero the cost is $3.30, giving the point (0, 3.30) on the
graph. This is the vertical or C(m) intercept. The graph is increasing in a straight line
from left to right because for each mile the cost goes up by $2.40; this rate remains
consistent.
In this example you have seen the taxicab cost modeled in words, an equation, a table and
in graphical form. Whenever possible, ensure that you can link these four representations
together to continually build your skills. It is important to note that you will not always
be able to find all 4 representations for a problem and so being able to work with all 4
forms is very important.

Section 2.1 Linear Functions101

Linear Function
A linear function is a function whose graph produces a line. Linear functions can
always be written in the form
or
f ( x)  b  mx
f ( x)  mx  b ; they’re equivalent
where
b is the initial or starting value of the function (when input, x = 0), and
m is the constant rate of change of the function
Many people like to write linear functions in the form f ( x)  b  mx because it
corresponds to the way we tend to speak: “The output starts at b and increases at a rate
of m.”
For this reason alone we will use the f ( x)  b  mx form for many of the examples, but
remember they are equivalent and can be written correctly both ways.
Slope and Increasing/Decreasing
m is the constant rate of change of the function (also called slope). The slope
determines if the function is an increasing function or a decreasing function.
f ( x)  b  mx is an increasing function if m  0
f ( x)  b  mx is a decreasing function if m  0
If m  0 , the rate of change zero, and the function f ( x)  b  0 x  b is just a horizontal
line passing through the point (0, b), neither increasing nor decreasing.
Example 1
Marcus currently owns 200 songs in his iTunes collection. Every month, he adds 15
new songs. Write a formula for the number of songs, N, in his iTunes collection as a
function of the number of months, m. How many songs will he own in a year?
The initial value for this function is 200, since he currently owns 200 songs, so
N (0)  200 . The number of songs increases by 15 songs per month, so the rate of
change is 15 songs per month. With this information, we can write the formula:
N (m)  200  15m .
N(m) is an increasing linear function.
With this formula we can predict how many songs he will have in 1 year (12 months):
N (12)  200  15(12)  200  180  380 . Marcus will have 380 songs in 12 months.

Calculating Rate of Change
Given two values for the input, x1 and x2 , and two corresponding values for the output,
y1 and y 2 , or a set of points, ( x1 , y1 ) and ( x2 , y 2 ) , if we wish to find a linear function
that contains both points we can calculate the rate of change, m:
change in output y y 2  y1
m


change in input x x2  x1
Rate of change of a linear function is also called the slope of the line.
Note in function notation, y1  f ( x1 ) and y 2  f ( x2 ) , so we could equivalently write
f  x2   f  x1 
m
x2  x1
Example 2

the rate of change of the population during this time span.
The rate of change will relate the change in population to the change in time. The
population increased by 27800  23400  4400 people over the 4 year time interval. To
find the rate of change, the number of people per year the population changed by:

= 1100 people per year

Notice that we knew the population was increasing, so we would expect our value for m

The rate of change, or slope, 0.434 would have units

The initial value, 14.696, will have the same units as the output, so this tells us that at a
depth of 0 feet, the pressure on the diver will be 14.696 PSI.
Example 4
If f (x) is a linear function, f (3)  2 , and f (8)  1 , find the rate of change.
f (3)  2 tells us that the input 3 corresponds with the output -2, and f (8)  1 tells us
that the input 8 corresponds with the output 1. To find the rate of change, we divide the
change in output by the change in input:

2. Given the two points (2, 3) and (0, 4), find the rate of change. Is this function
increasing or decreasing?
We can now find the rate of change given two input-output pairs, and can write an
equation for a linear function once we have the rate of change and initial value. If we
have two input-output pairs and they do not include the initial value of the function, then
we will have to solve for it.
Example 5
Write an equation for the linear function
graphed to the right.
Looking at the graph, we might notice that it
passes through the points (0, 7) and (4, 4).
From the first value, we know the initial value
of the function is b = 7, so in this case we will
only need to calculate the rate of change:

. In this case, we do not
5
know the initial value f (0) , so we will have to solve for it. Using the rate of change,
3
we know the equation will have the form f ( x)  b  x . Since we know the value of

the function when x = 3, we can evaluate the function at 3.

this function:

Example 7
Working as an insurance salesperson, Ilya earns a base salary and a commission on each
new policy, so Ilya’s weekly income, I, depends on the number of new policies, n, he
sells during the week. Last week he sold 3 new policies, and earned $760 for the week.
The week before, he sold 5 new policies, and earned $920. Find an equation for I(n),
and interpret the meaning of the components of the equation.
The given information gives us two input-output pairs: (3,760) and (5,920). We start
by finding the rate of change.
920  760 160
m

 80
53

Section 2.1 Linear Functions105
Keeping track of units can help us interpret this quantity. Income increased by $160
when the number of policies increased by 2, so the rate of change is $80 per policy; Ilya
earns a commission of $80 for each policy sold during the week.
We can then solve for the initial value
then when n = 3, I (3)  760 , giving
I (n)  b  80n
this allows us to solve for b
760  b  80(3)
b  760  80(3)  520
This value is the starting value for the function. This is Ilya’s income when n = 0,
which means no new policies are sold. We can interpret this as Ilya’s base salary for
the week, which does not depend upon the number of policies sold.
Writing the final equation:
I (n)  520  80n
Our final interpretation is: Ilya’s base salary is $520 per week and he earns an
additional $80 commission for each policy sold each week.

We can see from the table that the initial value of rats is 1000 so in the linear format
P(w)  b  mw , b = 1000.
Rather than solving for m, we can notice from the table that the population goes up by
80 for every 2 weeks that pass. This rate is consistent from week 0, to week 2, 4, and 6.

106 Chapter 2
The rate of change is 80 rats per 2 weeks. This can be simplified to 40 rats per week and
we can write
P(w)  b  mw as P(w)  1000  40w

Section 2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions
When we are working with a new function, it is useful to know as much as we can about
the function: its graph, where the function is zero, and any other special behaviors of the
function. We will begin this exploration of linear functions with a look at graphs.
When graphing a linear function, there are three basic ways to graph it:
1) By plotting points (at least 2) and drawing a line through the points
2) Using the initial value (output when x = 0) and rate of change (slope)
3) Using transformations of the identity function f ( x)  x

Example 1
Graph f ( x)  5 

2
x by plotting points
3

In general, we evaluate the function at two or more inputs to find at least two points on
the graph. Usually it is best to pick input values that will “work nicely” in the equation.
2
In this equation, multiples of 3 will work nicely due to the
in the equation, and of
3
course using x = 0 to get the vertical intercept. Evaluating f(x) at x = 0, 3 and 6:
2
f (0)  5  (0)  5
3
2
f (3)  5  (3)  3
3
2
f (6)  5  (6)  1
3
These evaluations tell us that the points (0,5), (3,3), and (6,1) lie on the graph of the
line. Plotting these points and drawing a line through them gives us the graph

112 Chapter 2
When using the initial value and rate of change to graph, we need to consider the
graphical interpretation of these values. Remember the initial value of the function is the
output when the input is zero, so in the equation f ( x)  b  mx , the graph includes the
point (0, b). On the graph, this is the vertical intercept – the point where the graph
crosses the vertical axis.
For the rate of change, it is helpful to recall that we calculated this value as
change of output
m
change of input
From a graph of a line, this tells us that if we divide the vertical difference, or rise, of the
function outputs by the horizontal difference, or run, of the inputs, we will obtain the rate
of change, also called slope of the line.
m

change of output rise

change of input
run

Notice that this ratio is the same regardless of which two points we use
rise 2, run 4
m = 2/4 = ½
run 2, rise 1
m=½
run 2, rise 1
m=½

Graphical Interpretation of a Linear Equation
Graphically, in the equation f ( x)  b  mx
b is the vertical intercept of the graph and tells us we can start our graph at (0, b)
m is the slope of the line and tells us how far to rise & run to get to the next point
Once we have at least 2 points, we can extend the graph of the line to the left and right.
Example 2
Graph f ( x)  5 

2
x using the vertical intercept and slope.
3

The vertical intercept of the function is (0, 5), giving us a point on the graph of the line.

Section 2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions 113

2
. This tells us that for every 3 units the graph “runs” in the horizontal,
3
the vertical “rise” decreases by 2 units. In graphing, we can use this by first plotting our
vertical intercept on the graph, then using the slope to find a second point. From the
initial value (0, 5) the slope tells us that if we move to the right 3, we will move down 2,
moving us to the point (3, 3). We can continue this again to find a third point at (6, 1).
Finally, extend the line to the left and right, containing these points.
The slope is 

1. Consider that the slope -2/3 could also be written as

. Using
, find another

point on the graph that has a negative x value.
Another option for graphing is to use transformations of the identity function f ( x)  x .
In the equation f ( x)  mx , the m is acting as the vertical stretch of the identity function.
When m is negative, there is also a vertical reflection of the graph. Looking at some
examples:
f ( x )  3 x f ( x)  2 x f ( x )  x

f ( x) 

1
x
2

1
f ( x)  x
3

f ( x)   x
2

f ( x)   x
f ( x)  2 x

114 Chapter 2
In f ( x)  mx  b , the b acts as the vertical shift, moving the graph up and down without
affecting the slope of the line. Some examples:
f ( x)  x  4

f ( x)  x  2
f ( x)  x

f ( x)  x  2
f ( x)  x  4

Using Vertical Stretches or Compressions along with Vertical Shifts is another way to
look at identifying different types of linear functions. Although this may not be the
easiest way for you to graph this type of function, make sure you practice each method.
Example 3
Graph f ( x)  3 

1
x using transformations.
2

The equation is the graph of the identity function vertically compressed by ½ and
vertically shifted down 3.

combined with Vertical shift

Section 2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions 115
Notice how this nicely compares to the other method where the vertical intercept is found
at (0, -3) and to get to another point we rise (go up vertically) by 1 unit and run (go
horizontally) by 2 units to get to the next point (2,-2), and the next one (4, -1). In these
three points (0,-3), (2, -2), and (4, -1), the output values change by +1, and the x values
change by +2, corresponding with the slope m = 1/2.
Example 4
Match each equation with one of the lines in the graph below
f ( x)  2 x  3
g ( x)  2 x  3
h ( x )  2 x  3
1
j ( x)  x  3
2

Only one graph has a vertical intercept of -3, so we can immediately match that graph
with g(x). For the three graphs with a vertical intercept at 3, only one has a negative
slope, so we can match that line with h(x). Of the other two, the steeper line would
have a larger slope, so we can match that graph with equation f(x), and the flatter line
with the equation j(x).

j ( x) 

f ( x)  2 x  3

g ( x)  2 x  3

h( x)  2 x  3

116 Chapter 2
In addition to understanding the basic behavior of a linear function (increasing or
decreasing, recognizing the slope and vertical intercept), it is often helpful to know the
horizontal intercept of the function – where it crosses the horizontal axis.
Finding Horizontal Intercept
The horizontal intercept of the function is where the graph crosses the horizontal axis.
If a function has a horizontal intercept, you can always find it by solving f(x) = 0.
Example 5
Find the horizontal intercept of f ( x)  3 

x

Setting the function equal to zero to find what input will put us on the horizontal axis,
1
0  3  x
2
1
3 x
2
x6
The graph crosses the horizontal axis at (6,0)
There are two special cases of lines: a horizontal line and a
vertical line. In a horizontal line like the one graphed to the
right, notice that between any two points, the change in the
outputs is 0. In the slope equation, the numerator will be 0,
resulting in a slope of 0. Using a slope of 0 in the
f ( x)  b  mx , the equation simplifies to f ( x)  b .
Notice a horizontal line has a vertical intercept, but no
horizontal intercept (unless it’s the line f(x) = 0).
In the case of a vertical line, notice that between any two
points, the change in the inputs is zero. In the slope
equation, the denominator will be zero, and you may recall
that we cannot divide by the zero; the slope of a vertical line
is undefined. You might also notice that a vertical line is not
a function. To write the equation of vertical line, we simply
write input=value, like x  b .
Notice a vertical line has a horizontal intercept, but no
vertical intercept (unless it’s the line x = 0).

Section 2.2 Graphs of Linear Functions 117

Horizontal lines have equations of the form f ( x)  b
Vertical lines have equations of the form x = a

2. Describe the function f ( x)  6  3x in terms of transformations of the identity
function and find its horizontal intercept.
Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
When two lines are graphed together, the lines will be parallel if they are increasing at
the same rate – if the rates of change are the same. In this case, the graphs will never
cross (unless they’re the same line).
Parallel Lines
Two lines are parallel if the slopes are equal (or, if both lines are vertical). In other
words, given two linear equations f ( x)  b  m1 x and g ( x)  b  m2 x
The lines will be parallel if m1  m2
Example 8
Find a line parallel to f ( x)  6  3x that passes through the point (3, 0)
We know the line we’re looking for will have the same slope as the given line, m = 3.
Using this and the given point, we can solve for the new line’s vertical intercept:
g ( x)  b  3 x
then at (3, 0),
0  b  3(3)
b  9
The line we’re looking for is g ( x)  9  3x

118 Chapter 2
If two lines are not parallel, one other interesting possibility is that the lines are
perpendicular, which means the lines form a right angle (90 degree angle – a square
corner) where they meet. In this case, the slopes when multiplied together will equal -1.
Solving for one slope leads us to the definition:
Perpendicular Lines
Given two linear equations f ( x)  b  m1 x and g ( x)  b  m2 x
1
The lines will be perpendicular if m1m2  1, and so m2 
m1
We often say the slope of a perpendicular line is the “negative reciprocal” of the other
line’s slope.

a) a slope of 2.

b) a slope of -4.

3. Given the line h(t )  4  2t , find an equation for the line passing through (0, 0) that
is: a) parallel to h(t).
b) perpendicular to h(t).
Example 12
A line passes through the points (-2, 6) and (4, 5). Find the equation of a perpendicular
line that passes through the point (4, 5).
From the two given points on the reference line, we can calculate the slope of that line:

then at (4, 5),
g ( x)  b  6 x

b  19
Giving the line g ( x)  19  6 x

Intersections of Lines
The graphs of two lines will intersect if they are not parallel. They will intersect at the
point that satisfies both equations. To find this point when the equations are given as
functions, we can solve for an input value so that f ( x)  g ( x) . In other words, we can
set the formulas for the lines equal, and solve for the input that satisfies the equation.
Example 13
Find the intersection of the lines h(t )  3t  4 and j (t )  5  t
Setting h(t )  j (t ) ,
3t  4  5  t

a. Vertical intercept coordinates

c. Slope
d. Is j(t) parallel or perpendicular to h(t) (or neither)
e. Is j(t) an Increasing or Decreasing function (or neither)
f. Write a transformation description from the identity toolkit function f(x) = x
Finding the intersection allows us to answer other questions as well, such as discovering
when one function is larger than another.
Example 14
Using the functions from the previous example, for what values of t is h(t )  j (t )
To answer this question, it is helpful first to know where the functions are equal, since
that is the point where h(t) could switch from being greater to smaller than j(t) or vice9
versa. From the previous example, we know the functions are equal at t  .

quantities changing linearly, we typically follow the same problem solving strategies that
we would use for any type of function:
Problem solving strategy
1) Identify changing quantities, and then carefully and clearly define descriptive

Example 1
Emily saved up $3500 for her summer visit to Seattle. She anticipates spending $400
each week on rent, food, and fun. Find and interpret the horizontal intercept and
determine a reasonable domain and range for this function.
In the problem, there are two changing quantities: time and money. The amount of
money she has remaining while on vacation depends on how long she stays. We can
define our variables, including units.
Output: M, money remaining, in dollars
Input: t, time, in weeks
Reading the problem, we identify two important values. The first, $3500, is the initial
value for M. The other value appears to be a rate of change – the units of dollars per
week match the units of our output variable divided by our input variable. She is
spending money each week, so you should recognize that the amount of money
remaining is decreasing each week and the slope is negative.

Section 2.3 Modeling with Linear Functions 127
To answer the first question, looking for the horizontal intercept, it would be helpful to
have an equation modeling this scenario. Using the intercept and slope provided in the
problem, we can write the equation: M (t )  3500  400t .
To find the horizontal intercept, we set the output to zero, and solve for the input:
0  3500  400t
3500
t
 8.75
400
The horizontal intercept is 8.75 weeks. Since this represents the input value where the
output will be zero, interpreting this, we could say: Emily will have no money left after
8.75 weeks.
When modeling any real life scenario with functions, there is typically a limited domain
over which that model will be valid – almost no trend continues indefinitely. In this
case, it certainly doesn’t make sense to talk about input values less than zero. It is also
likely that this model is not valid after the horizontal intercept (unless Emily’s going to
start using a credit card and go into debt).
The domain represents the set of input values and so the reasonable domain for this
function is 0  t  8.75 .
However, in a real world scenario, the rental might be weekly or nightly. She may not
be able to stay a partial week and so all options should be considered. Emily could stay
in Seattle for 0 to 8 full weeks (and a couple of days), but would have to go into debt to
stay 9 full weeks, so restricted to whole weeks, a reasonable domain without going in to
debt would be 0  t  8 , or 0  t  9 if she went into debt to finish out the last week.
The range represents the set of output values and she starts with $3500 and ends with $0
after 8.75 weeks so the corresponding range is 0  M (t )  3500 .
If we limit the rental to whole weeks however, if she left after 8 weeks because she
didn’t have enough to stay for a full 9 weeks, she would have M(8) = 3500 -400(8) =
$300 dollars left after 8 weeks, giving a range of 300  M (t )  3500 . If she wanted to
stay the full 9 weeks she would be $100 in debt giving a range of  100  M (t )  3500 .
Most importantly remember that domain and range are tied together, and what ever you
decide is most appropriate for the domain (the independent variable) will dictate the
requirements for the range (the dependent variable).

Example 2
Jamal is choosing between two moving companies. The first, U-Haul, charges an upfront fee of $20, then 59 cents a mile. The second, Budget, charges an up-front fee of
$16, then 63 cents a mile3. When will U-Haul be the better choice for Jamal?
The two important quantities in this problem are the cost, and the number of miles that
are driven. Since we have two companies to consider, we will define two functions:
Input: m, miles driven
Outputs:
Y(m): cost, in dollars, for renting from U-Haul
B(m): cost, in dollars, for renting from Budget
Reading the problem carefully, it appears that we were given an initial cost and a rate of
change for each company. Since our outputs are measured in dollars but the costs per
mile given in the problem are in cents, we will need to convert these quantities to match
our desired units: $0.59 a mile for U-Haul, and $0.63 a mile for Budget.
Looking to what we’re trying to find, we want to know when U-Haul will be the better
choice. Since all we have to make that decision from is the costs, we are looking for
when U-Haul will cost less, or when Y (m)  B(m) . The solution pathway will lead us
to find the equations for the two functions, find the intersection, then look to see where
the Y(m) function is smaller. Using the rates of change and initial charges, we can write
the equations:
Y (m)  20  0.59m
B(m)  16  0.63m
These graphs are sketched to the right, with Y(m)
drawn dashed.
To find the intersection, we set the equations
equal and solve:
Y(m) = B(m)
20  0.59m  16  0.63m
4  0.04m
m  100
This tells us that the cost from the two companies will be the same if 100 miles are
driven. Either by looking at the graph, or noting that Y(m) is growing at a slower rate,
we can conclude that U-Haul will be the cheaper price when more than 100 miles are
driven.

Example 3
A town’s population has been growing linearly. In 2004 the population was 6,200. By
2009 the population had grown to 8,100. If this trend continues,
a. Predict the population in 2013
b. When will the population reach 15000?
The two changing quantities are the population and time. While we could use the actual
year value as the input quantity, doing so tends to lead to very ugly equations, since the
vertical intercept would correspond to the year 0, more than 2000 years ago!
To make things a little nicer, and to make our lives easier too, we will define our input
as years since 2004:
Input: t, years since 2004
Output: P(t), the town’s population
The problem gives us two input-output pairs. Converting them to match our defined
variables, the year 2004 would correspond to t = 0, giving the point (0, 6200). Notice
that through our clever choice of variable definition, we have “given” ourselves the
vertical intercept of the function. The year 2009 would correspond to t = 5, giving the
point (5, 8100).
To predict the population in 2013 (t = 9), we would need an equation for the population.
Likewise, to find when the population would reach 15000, we would need to solve for
the input that would provide an output of 15000. Either way, we need an equation. To
find it, we start by calculating the rate of change:
8100  6200 1900
m

 380 people per year
50
5
Since we already know the vertical intercept of the line, we can immediately write the
equation:
P(t )  6200  380t
To predict the population in 2013, we evaluate our function at t = 9
P(9)  6200  380(9)  9620
If the trend continues, our model predicts a population of 9,620 in 2013.
To find when the population will reach 15,000, we can set P(t) = 15000 and solve for t.
15000  6200  380t
8800  380t
t  23.158
Our model predicts the population will reach 15,000 in a little more than 23 years after
2004, or somewhere around the year 2027.

130 Chapter 2
Example 4
Anna and Emanuel start at the same intersection. Anna walks east at 4 miles per hour
while Emanuel walks south at 3 miles per hour. They are communicating with a twoway radio with a range of 2 miles. How long after they start walking will they fall out
of radio contact?
In essence, we can partially answer this question by saying they will fall out of radio
contact when they are 2 miles apart, which leads us to ask a new question: how long
will it take them to be 2 miles apart?
In this problem, our changing quantities are time and the two peoples’ positions, but
ultimately we need to know how long will it take for them to be 2 miles apart. We can
see that time will be our input variable, so we’ll define
Input: t, time in hours.
Since it is not obvious how to define our output variables, we’ll start by drawing a
picture.
Anna walking east, 4 miles/hour

Distance between them
Emanuel walking south, 3 miles/hour
Because of the complexity of this question, it may be helpful to introduce some
intermediary variables. These are quantities that we aren’t directly interested in, but
seem important to the problem. For this problem, Anna’s and Emanuel’s distances
from the starting point seem important. To notate these, we are going to define a
coordinate system, putting the “starting point” at the intersection where they both
started, then we’re going to introduce a variable, A, to represent Anna’s position, and
define it to be a measurement from the starting point, in the eastward direction.
Likewise, we’ll introduce a variable, E, to represent Emanuel’s position, measured from
the starting point in the southward direction. Note that in defining the coordinate
system we specified both the origin, or starting point, of the measurement, as well as the
direction of measure.
While we’re at it, we’ll define a third variable, D, to be the measurement of the distance
between Anna and Emanuel. Showing the variables on the picture is often helpful:
Looking at the variables on the picture, we remember we need to know how long it
takes for D, the distance between them, to equal 2 miles.

Seeing this picture we remember that in order to find the distance
between the two, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem, a

2

From here, we can now look back at the problem for relevant information. Anna is
walking 4 miles per hour, and Emanuel is walking 3 miles per hour, which are rates of
change. Using those, we can write formulas for the distance each has walked.
They both start at the same intersection and so when t = 0, the distance travelled by each
person should also be 0, so given the rate for each, and the initial value for each, we get:

A(t )  4t
E (t )  3t
Using the Pythagorean theorem we get:

D(t )2  A(t )2  E (t )2
D(t )2  (4t )2  (3t )2  16t 2  9t 2  25t 2

substitute in the function formulas
solve for D(t) using the square root

D(t )   25t 2  5 t
Since in this scenario we are only considering positive values of t and our distance D(t)
will always be positive, we can simplify this answer to D(t )  5t
Interestingly, the distance between them is also a linear function. Using it, we can now
answer the question of when the distance between them will reach 2 miles:
D (t )  2
5t  2
2
t   0.4
5
They will fall out of radio contact in 0.4 hours, or 24 minutes.

132 Chapter 2
Example 5
There is currently a straight road leading from the town of Westborough to a town 30
miles east and 10 miles north. Partway down this road, it junctions with a second road,
perpendicular to the first, leading to the town of Eastborough. If the town of
Eastborough is located 20 miles directly east of the town of Westborough, how far is the
road junction from Westborough?
It might help here to draw a picture of
the situation. It would then be helpful to
introduce a coordinate system. While we
could place the origin anywhere, placing
it at Westborough seems convenient.
This puts the other town at coordinates
(30, 10), and Eastborough at (20, 0).

Other town
(30, 10)
(0, 0)
Westborough

(20, 0)
Eastborough

Using this point along with the origin, we can find the slope of the line from
10  0 1
Westborough to the other town: m 
 . This gives the equation of the road
30  0 3
1
from Westborough to the other town to be W ( x)  x .
3
From this, we can determine the perpendicular road to Eastborough will have slope
m  3 . Since the town of Eastborough is at the point (20, 0), we can find the equation:
plug in the point (20, 0)
E( x)  3x  b
0  3(20)  b
b  60
E ( x)  3x  60
We can now find the coordinates of the junction of the roads by finding the intersection
of these lines. Setting them equal,
1
x  3x  60

10
x  60
3
10 x  180
Substituting this back into W(x)
x  18
1
y  W (18)  (18)  6
3
The roads intersect at the point (18, 6). Using the distance formula, we can now find
the distance from Westborough to the junction:
dist  (18  0) 2  (6  0) 2  18.934 miles.

Section 2.4 Fitting Linear Models to Data
In the real world, rarely do things follow trends perfectly. When we expect the trend to
behave linearly, or when inspection suggests the trend is behaving linearly, it is often
desirable to find an equation to approximate the data. Finding an equation to approximate
the data helps us understand the behavior of the data and allows us to use the linear
model to make predictions about the data, inside and outside of the data range.
Example 1
The table below shows the number of cricket chirps in 15 seconds, and the air
temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit4. Plot this data, and determine whether the data
appears to be linearly related.

Cricket Chirps in 15 seconds

The simplest way to find an equation to approximate this data is to try to “eyeball” a line
that seems to fit the data pretty well, then find an equation for that line based on the slope
and intercept.
You can see from the trend in the data that the number of chirps increases as the
temperature increases. As you consider a function for this data you should know that you
are looking at an increasing function or a function with a positive slope.

This linear equation can then be used to approximate the solution to various questions we
might ask about the trend. While the data does not perfectly fall on the linear equation,
the equation is our best guess as to how the relationship will behave outside of the values
we have data for. There is a difference, though, between making predictions inside the
domain and range of values we have data for, and outside that domain and range.
Interpolation and Extrapolation
Interpolation: When we predict a value inside the domain and range of the data
Extrapolation: When we predict a value outside the domain and range of the data
For the Temperature as a function of chirps in our hand drawn model above:
Interpolation would occur if we used our model to predict temperature when the values
for chirps are between 18.5 and 44.
Extrapolation would occur if we used our model to predict temperature when the values
for chirps are less than 18.5 or greater than 44.

140 Chapter 2
Example 3
a) Would predicting the temperature when crickets are chirping 30 times in 15 seconds
be interpolation or extrapolation? Make the prediction, and discuss if it is reasonable.
b) Would predicting the number of chirps crickets will make at 40 degrees be
interpolation or extrapolation? Make the prediction, and discuss if it is reasonable.
With our cricket data, our number of chirps in the data provided varied from 18.5 to 44.
A prediction at 30 chirps per 15 seconds is inside the domain of our data, so would be
interpolation. Using our model:
T (30)  30  1.2(30)  66 degrees.
Based on the data we have, this value seems reasonable.
The temperature values varied from 52 to 80.5. Predicting the number of chirps at 40
degrees is extrapolation since 40 is outside the range of our data. Using our model:
40  30  1.2c
10  1.2c
c  8.33
Our model predicts the crickets would chirp 8.33 times in 15 seconds. While this might
be possible, we have no reason to believe our model is valid outside the domain and
range. In fact, generally crickets stop chirping altogether below around 50 degrees.
When our model no longer applies after some point, it is sometimes called model
breakdown.

What temperature would you predict if you counted 20 chirps in 15 seconds?
Fitting Lines with Technology
While eyeballing a line works reasonably well, there are statistical techniques for fitting a
line to data that minimize the differences between the line and data values5. This
technique is called least-square regression, and can be computed by many graphing
calculators, spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Docs, statistical software, and
many web-based calculators6.

5

Technically, the method minimizes the sum of the squared differences in the vertical direction between
the line and the data values.

For example, http://www.shodor.org/unchem/math/lls/leastsq.html

Section 2.4 Fitting Linear Models to Data 141
Example 4
Find the least-squares regression line using the cricket chirp data from above.
Using the cricket chirp data from earlier,
with technology we obtain the equation:
T (c)  30.281  1.143c

Notice that this line is quite similar to the
equation we “eyeballed”, but should fit the
data better. Notice also that using this
equation would change our prediction for
the temperature when hearing 30 chirps in
15 seconds from 66 degrees to:
T (30)  30.281  1.143(30)  64.571  64.6

Most calculators and computer software will also provide you with the correlation
coefficient, a measure of how closely the line fits the data.
Correlation Coefficient
The correlation coefficient is a value, r, between -1 and 1.
r > 0 suggests a positive (increasing) relationship
r < 0 suggests a negative (decreasing) relationship
The closer the value is to 0, the more scattered the data
The closer the value is to 1 or -1, the less scattered the data is
The correlation coefficient provides an easy way to get some idea of how close to a line
the data falls.
We should only compute the correlation coefficient for data that follows a linear pattern;
if the data exhibits a non-linear pattern, the correlation coefficient is meaningless. To get
a sense for the relationship between the value of r and the graph of the data, here are
some large data sets with their correlation coefficients:

Examples of Correlation Coefficient Values

Example 5
Calculate the correlation coefficient for our cricket data.
Because the data appears to follow a linear pattern, we can use technology to calculate
r = 0.9509. Since this value is very close to 1, it suggests a strong increasing linear
relationship.

Gasoline consumption in the US has been increasing steadily. Consumption data from
1994 to 2004 is shown below.8 Determine if the trend is linear, and if so, find a model

To make things simpler, a new
input variable is introduced, t,
representing years since 1994.
Using technology, the
correlation coefficient was
calculated to be 0.9965,
suggesting a very strong
increasing linear trend.

Section 2.5 Absolute Value Functions
So far in this chapter we have been studying the behavior of linear functions. The
Absolute Value Function is a piecewise-defined function made up of two linear
functions. The name, Absolute Value Function, should be familiar to you from
Section 1.2. In its basic form f ( x)  x it is one of our toolkit functions.

Absolute Value Function
The absolute value function can be defined as
 x if x  0
f ( x)  x  
 x if x  0
The absolute value function is commonly used to determine the distance between
two numbers on the number line. Given two values a and b, then a  b will give
the distance, a positive quantity, between these values, regardless of which value is
larger.
Example 1
Describe all values, x, within a distance of 4 from the number 5.
We want the distance between x and 5 to be less than or equal to 4. The distance can be
represented using the absolute value, giving the expression
x5  4

Example 2
A 2010 poll reported 78% of Americans believe that people who are gay should be able
to serve in the US military, with a reported margin of error of 3%9. The margin of error
tells us how far off the actual value could be from the survey value10. Express the set of
possible values using absolute values.
Since we want the size of the difference between the actual percentage, p, and the
reported percentage to be less than 3%,
p  78  3

9

http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm, retrieved August 4, 2010
Technically, margin of error usually means that the surveyors are 95% confident that actual value falls
within this range.

1. Students who score within 20 points of 80 will pass the test. Write this as a distance
from 80 using the absolute value notation.
Important Features
The most significant feature of the absolute value graph is the corner point where the
graph changes direction. When finding the equation for a transformed absolute
value function, this point is very helpful for determining the horizontal and vertical
shifts.
Example 3
Write an equation for the function graphed below.

The basic absolute value function changes direction at the origin, so this graph has been
shifted to the right 3 and down 2 from the basic toolkit function. We might also notice
that the graph appears stretched, since the linear portions have slopes of 2 and -2. From
this information we can write the equation:
f ( x)  2 x  3  2 , treating the stretch as a vertical stretch

f ( x)  2( x  3)  2 , treating the stretch as a horizontal compression
Note that these equations are algebraically equivalent – the stretch for an absolute value
function can be written interchangeably as a vertical or horizontal stretch/compression.
If you had not been able to determine the stretch based on the slopes of the lines, you
can solve for the stretch factor by putting in a known pair of values for x and f(x)
f ( x)  a x  3  2
Now substituting in the point (1, 2)

2  a1  3  2
4  2a
a2

2. Given the description of the transformed absolute value function write the equation.
The absolute value function is horizontally shifted left 2 units, is vertically flipped, and
vertically shifted up 3 units,
The graph of an absolute value function will have a vertical intercept when the input
is zero. The graph may or may not have horizontal intercepts, depending on how the
graph has been shifted and reflected. It is possible for the absolute value function to
have zero, one, or two horizontal intercepts.
Zero horizontal intercepts

One

Two

To find the horizontal intercepts, we will need to solve an equation involving an
absolute value.
Notice that the absolute value function is not one-to-one, so typically inverses of
absolute value functions are not discussed.
Solving Absolute Value Equations
To solve an equation like 8  2 x  6 , we can notice that the absolute value will be
equal to eight if the quantity inside the absolute value were 8 or -8. This leads to
two different equations we can solve independently:
or
2x  6  8
2 x  6  8
2 x  14
2 x  2
x7
x  1
Solutions to Absolute Value Equations
An equation of the form A  B , with B  0 , will have solutions when
A  B or A   B

Section 2.5 Absolute Value Functions 149
Example 4
Find the horizontal intercepts of the graph of f ( x)  4 x  1  7
The horizontal intercepts will occur when f ( x)  0 . Solving,
0  4x  1  7
Isolate the absolute value on one side of the equation

7  4x  1

Now we can break this into two separate equations:

7  4x  1
6  4x

 8  4x

1 4x2 2

1  4 x  2

At this point, we notice that this equation has no solutions – the absolute value always
returns a positive value, so it is impossible for the absolute value to equal a negative
value.

3. Find the horizontal & vertical intercepts for the function f ( x)   x  2  3

Solving Absolute Value Inequalities
When absolute value inequalities are written to describe a set of values, like the
inequality x  5  4 we wrote earlier, it is sometimes desirable to express this set of
values without the absolute value, either using inequalities, or using interval
notation.

150 Chapter 2
We will explore two approaches to solving absolute value inequalities:
1) Using the graph
2) Using test values
Example 6
Solve x  5  4
With both approaches, we will need to know first where the corresponding equality is
true. In this case we first will find where x  5  4 . We do this because the absolute
value is a nice friendly function with no breaks, so the only way the function values can
switch from being less than 4 to being greater than 4 is by passing through where the
values equal 4. Solve x  5  4 ,
x5  4
x9

or

x  5  4
x 1

To use a graph, we can sketch the function f ( x)  x  5 . To help us see where the
outputs are 4, the line g ( x)  4 could also be sketched.

On the graph, we can see that indeed the output values of the absolute value are equal to
4 at x = 1 and x = 9. Based on the shape of the graph, we can determine the absolute
value is less than or equal to 4 between these two points, when 1  x  9 . In interval
notation, this would be the interval [1,9].
As an alternative to graphing, after determining that the absolute value is equal to 4 at x
= 1 and x = 9, we know the graph can only change from being less than 4 to greater than
4 at these values. This divides the number line up into three intervals: x<1, 1<x<9, and
x>9. To determine when the function is less than 4, we could pick a value in each
interval and see if the output is less than or greater than 4.

Since 1  x  9 is the only interval in which the output at the test value is less than 4,
we can conclude the solution to x  5  4 is 1  x  9 .

Example 7
Given the function f ( x)  

4 x  5  3 , determine for what x values the function

values are negative.
We are trying to determine where f(x) < 0, which is when 

1
4 x  5  3  0 . We begin
2

by isolating the absolute value:
1
when we multiply both sides by -2, it reverses the inequality
 4 x  5  3
2
4x  5  6
Next we solve for the equality 4 x  5  6
4x  5  6
4 x  5  6
4 x  11
4 x  1
or

We can now either pick test values or sketch a graph of the function to determine on
which intervals the original function value are negative. Notice that it is not even really
important exactly what the graph looks like, as long as we know that it crosses the
1
11
horizontal axis at x 
and x  , and that the graph has been reflected vertically.

A square is cut out of cardboard, with each side having length L. If we wanted to write a
function for the area of the square, with L as the input and the area as output, you may
recall that the area of a rectangle can be found by multiplying the length times the width.
Since our shape is a square, the length & the width are the same, giving the formula:
A( L)  L  L  L2
Likewise, if we wanted a function for the volume of a cube with each side having some
length L, you may recall volume of a rectangular box can be found by multiplying length
by width by height, which are all equal for a cube, giving the formula:
V ( L)  L  L  L  L3
These two functions are examples of power functions, functions that are some power of
the variable.
Power Function
A power function is a function that can be represented in the form
f ( x)  x p
Where the base is a variable and the exponent, p, is a number.
Example 1
Which of our toolkit functions are power functions?
The constant and identity functions are power functions, since they can be written as
f ( x)  x 0 and f ( x)  x1 respectively.
The quadratic and cubic functions are both power functions with whole number powers:
f ( x)  x 2 and f ( x)  x 3 .
The reciprocal and reciprocal squared functions are both power functions with negative
whole number powers since they can be written as f ( x)  x 1 and f ( x)  x 2 .
The square and cube root functions are both power functions with fractional powers
since they can be written as f ( x)  x1 2 or f ( x)  x1 3 .

1. What point(s) do the toolkit power functions have in common?

f ( x)  x 6

f ( x)  x 4

Characteristics of Power Functions
Shown to the right are the graphs of
f ( x)  x 2 , f ( x)  x 4 , and f ( x)  x 6 , all
even whole number powers. Notice that all
these graphs have a fairly similar shape, very
similar to the quadratic toolkit, but as the
power increases the graphs flatten somewhat
near the origin, and become steeper away
from the origin.

f ( x)  x 2

To describe the behavior as numbers become larger and larger, we use the idea of
infinity. The symbol for positive infinity is  , and   for negative infinity. When we
say that “x approaches infinity”, which can be symbolically written as x   , we are
describing a behavior – we are saying that x is getting large in the positive direction.
With the even power function, as the input becomes large in either the positive or
negative direction, the output values become very large positive numbers. Equivalently,
we could describe this by saying that as x approaches positive or negative infinity, the f(x)
values approach positive infinity. In symbolic form, we could write: as x   ,
f (x)   .
f ( x)  x 5
f ( x)  x 7
Shown here are the graphs of
f ( x)  x 3 , f ( x)  x 5 , and f ( x)  x 7 , all odd whole
f ( x)  x 3
number powers. Notice all these graphs look
similar to the cubic toolkit, but again as the power
increases the graphs flatten near the origin and
become steeper away from the origin.
For these odd power functions, as x approaches
negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity.
As x approaches positive infinity, f(x) approaches
positive infinity. In symbolic form we write: as
x   , f (x)   and as x   , f (x)   .

Long Run Behavior
The behavior of the graph of a function as the input takes on large negative values
( x   ) and large positive values ( x   ) as is referred to as the long run behavior
of the function.

3.1 Power and Polynomial Functions 157
Example 2
Describe the long run behavior of the graph of f ( x)  x 8 .
Since f ( x)  x 8 has a whole, even power, we would expect this function to behave
somewhat like the quadratic function. As the input gets large positive or negative, we
would expect the output to grow without bound in the positive direction. In symbolic
form, as x   , f (x)   .

Example 3
Describe the long run behavior of the graph of f ( x)   x 9
Since this function has a whole odd power, we would expect it to behave somewhat like
the cubic function. The negative in front of the x 9 will cause a vertical reflection, so as
the inputs grow large positive, the outputs will grow large in the negative direction, and
as the inputs grow large negative, the outputs will grow large in the positive direction.
In symbolic form, for the long run behavior we would write: as x   ,
f (x)   and as x   , f (x)   .
You may use words or symbols to describe the long run behavior of these functions.

each week. If we wanted to write a formula for the area covered by the oil slick, we
could do so by composing two functions together. The first is a formula for the radius, r,
of the spill, which depends on the number of weeks, w, that have passed. Hopefully you
recognized that this relationship is linear:
r (w)  24  8w
We can combine this with the formula for the area, A, of a circle:
A(r )  r 2
Composing these functions gives a formula for the area in terms of weeks:
A(w)  A(r (w))  A(24  8w)   (24  8w) 2

158 Chapter 3
Multiplying this out gives the formula
A(w)  576  384w  64w2
This formula is an example of a polynomial. A polynomial is simply the sum of terms
each consisting of a transformed power function with positive whole number power.
Terminology of Polynomial Functions
A polynomial is function that can be written as f ( x)  a0  a1 x  a2 x 2    an x n
Each of the ai constants are called coefficients and can be positive, negative, or zero,
and be whole numbers, decimals, or fractions.
A term of the polynomial is any one piece of the sum, that is any ai x i . Each individual
term is a transformed power function.
The degree of the polynomial is the highest power of the variable that occurs in the
polynomial.
The leading term is the term containing the highest power of the variable: the term
with the highest degree.
The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the leading term.
Because of the definition of the “leading” term we often rearrange polynomials so that
the powers are descending.
f ( x)  an x n  .....  a2 x 2  a1 x  a0
Example 4
Identify the degree, leading term, and leading coefficient of these polynomials:
f ( x)  3  2 x 2  4 x 3
g (t )  5t 5  2t 3  7t
h( p)  6 p  p 3  2
For the function f(x), the degree is 3, the highest power on x. The leading term is the
term containing that power,  4x 3 . The leading coefficient is the coefficient of that
term, -4.
For g(t), the degree is 5, the leading term is 5t 5 , and the leading coefficient is 5.
For h(p), the degree is 3, the leading term is  p 3 , so the leading coefficient is -1.

3.1 Power and Polynomial Functions 159
Long Run Behavior of Polynomials
For any polynomial, the long run behavior of the polynomial will match the long run
behavior of the leading term.
Example 5
What can we determine about the long run behavior and degree of the equation for the
polynomial graphed here?

Since the output grows large and positive as the inputs grow large and positive, we
describe the long run behavior symbolically by writing: as x   , f (x)   .
Similarly, as x   , f (x)   .
In words, we could say that as x values approach infinity, the function values approach
infinity, and as x values approach negative infinity the function values approach
negative infinity.
We can tell this graph has the shape of an odd degree power function which has not
been reflected, so the degree of the polynomial creating this graph must be odd, and the
leading coefficient would be positive.

3. Given the function f ( x)  0.2( x  2)( x  1)( x  5) use your algebra skills to write the
function in standard polynomial form (as a sum of terms) and determine the leading
term, degree, and long run behavior of the function.
Short Run Behavior
Characteristics of the graph such as vertical and horizontal intercepts and the places the
graph changes direction are part of the short run behavior of the polynomial.
Like with all functions, the vertical intercept is where the graph crosses the vertical axis,
and occurs when the input value is zero. Since a polynomial is a function, there can only
be one vertical intercept, which occurs at the point (0, a0 ) . The horizontal intercepts
occur at the input values that correspond with an output value of zero. It is possible to
have more than one horizontal intercept.
Horizontal intercepts are also called zeros, or roots of the function.

160 Chapter 3
Example 6
Given the polynomial function f ( x)  ( x  2)( x  1)( x  4) , written in factored form for
your convenience, determine the vertical and horizontal intercepts.
The vertical intercept occurs when the input is zero.
f (0)  (0  2)(0  1)(0  4)  8 .
The graph crosses the vertical axis at the point (0, 8).
The horizontal intercepts occur when the output is zero.
0  ( x  2)( x  1)( x  4) when x = 2, -1, or 4.
f(x) has zeros, or roots, at x = 2, -1, and 4.
The graph crosses the horizontal axis at the points (2, 0), (-1, 0), and (4, 0)
Notice that the polynomial in the previous example, which would be degree three if
multiplied out, had three horizontal intercepts and two turning points – places where the
graph changes direction. We will now make a general statement without justifying it –
the reasons will become clear later in this chapter.
Intercepts and Turning Points of Polynomials
A polynomial of degree n will have:
At most n horizontal intercepts. An odd degree polynomial will always have at least
one.
At most n-1 turning points
Example 7
What can we conclude about the graph of the polynomial shown here?

Based on the long run behavior, with the graph becoming large positive on both ends of
the graph, we can determine that this is the graph of an even degree polynomial. The
graph has 2 horizontal intercepts, suggesting a degree of 2 or greater, and 3 turning
points, suggesting a degree of 4 or greater. Based on this, it would be reasonable to
conclude that the degree is even and at least 4, so it is probably a fourth degree
polynomial.

3. The leading term is 0.2 x 3 , so it is a degree 3 polynomial.
As x approaches infinity (or gets very large in the positive direction) f(x) approaches

f(x) approaches negative infinity. (Basically the long run behavior is the same as the

Section 3.2 Quadratic Functions
In this section, we will explore the family of 2nd degree polynomials, the quadratic
functions. While they share many characteristics of polynomials in general, the
calculations involved in working with quadratics is typically a little simpler, which makes
them a good place to start our exploration of short run behavior. In addition, quadratics
commonly arise from problems involving area and projectile motion, providing some
interesting applications.
Example 1
A backyard farmer wants to enclose a rectangular space for a new garden. She has
purchased 80 feet of wire fencing to enclose 3 sides, and will put the 4th side against the
backyard fence. Find a formula for the area enclosed by the fence if the sides of fencing
perpendicular to the existing fence have length L.
In a scenario like this involving geometry, it is often
helpful to draw a picture. It might also be helpful to
introduce a temporary variable, W, to represent the side
of fencing parallel to the 4th side or backyard fence.

Garden

L

W

Backyard
Since we know we only have 80 feet of fence available,
we know that L  W  L  80 , or more simply,
2L W  80 . This allows us to represent the width, W, in terms of L: W  80  2L
Now we are ready to write an equation for the area the fence encloses. We know the
area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, so
A  LW  L(80  2L)
A( L)  80L  2L2
This formula represents the area of the fence in terms of the variable length L.
Short run Behavior: Vertex
We now explore the interesting features of the graphs of quadratics. In addition to
intercepts, quadratics have an interesting feature where they change direction, called the
vertex. You probably noticed that all quadratics are related to transformations of the
basic quadratic function f ( x)  x 2 .

164 Chapter 3
Example 2
Write an equation for the quadratic graphed below as a transformation of f ( x)  x 2 ,
then expand the formula and simplify terms to write the equation in standard
polynomial form.

We can see the graph is the basic quadratic shifted to the left 2 and down 3, giving a
formula in the form g ( x)  a( x  2) 2  3 . By plugging in a point that falls on the grid,
such as (0,-1), we can solve for the stretch factor:
 1  a(0  2) 2  3
2  4a

Written as a transformation, the equation for this formula is g ( x) 

Notice that the horizontal and vertical shifts of the basic quadratic determine the location
of the vertex of the parabola; the vertex is unaffected by stretches and compressions.

Forms of Quadratic Functions
The standard form of a quadratic function is f ( x)  ax 2  bx  c
The transformation form of a quadratic function is f ( x)  a( x  h) 2  k
The vertex of the quadratic function is located at (h, k), where h and k are the numbers
in the transformation form of the function. Because the vertex appears in the
transformation form, it is often called the vertex form.
In the previous example, we saw that it is possible to rewrite a quadratic function given in
transformation form and rewrite it in standard form by expanding the formula. It would
be useful to reverse this process, since the transformation form reveals the vertex.
Expanding out the general transformation form of a quadratic gives:
f ( x)  a( x  h) 2  k  a( x  h)( x  h)  k

f ( x)  a( x 2  2 xh  h 2 )  k  ax 2  2ahx  ah 2  k
This should be equal to the standard form of the quadratic:
ax 2  2ahx  ah 2  k  ax 2  bx  c
The second degree terms are already equal. For the linear terms to be equal, the
coefficients must be equal:
b
 2ah  b , so h  
2a
This provides us a method to determine the horizontal shift of the quadratic from the
standard form. We could likewise set the constant terms equal to find:

In practice, though, it is usually easier to remember that k is the output value of the
function when the input is h, so k  f (h) .

2. Given the equation g ( x)  13  x 2  6 x write the equation in standard form and then
in transformation/vertex form.
In addition to enabling us to more easily graph a quadratic written in standard form,
finding the vertex serves another important purpose – it allows us to determine the
maximum or minimum value of the function, depending on which way the graph opens.
Example 4
Returning to our backyard farmer from the beginning of the section, what dimensions
should she make her garden to maximize the enclosed area?
Earlier we determined the area she could enclose with 80 feet of fencing on three sides
was given by the equation A( L)  80L  2L2 . Notice that quadratic has been vertically
reflected, since the coefficient on the squared term is negative, so the graph will open
downwards, and the vertex will be a maximum value for the area.
In finding the vertex, we take care since the equation is not written in standard
polynomial form with decreasing powers. But we know that a is the coefficient on the
squared term, so a = -2, b = 80, and c = 0.

3.2 Quadratic Functions 167
Finding the vertex:
80
h
 20 , k  A(20)  80(20)  2(20) 2  800
2(2)
The maximum value of the function is an area of 800 square feet, which occurs when L
= 20 feet. When the shorter sides are 20 feet, that leaves 40 feet of fencing for the
longer side. To maximize the area, she should enclose the garden so the two shorter
sides have length 20 feet, and the longer side parallel to the existing fence has length 40
feet.
Example 5
A local newspaper currently has 84,000 subscribers, at a quarterly charge of $30.
Market research has suggested that if they raised the price to $32, they would lose 5,000
subscribers. Assuming that subscriptions are linearly related to the price, what price
should the newspaper charge for a quarterly subscription to maximize their revenue?
Revenue is the amount of money a company brings in. In this case, the revenue can be
found by multiplying the charge per subscription times the number of subscribers. We
can introduce variables, C for charge per subscription and S for the number subscribers,
giving us the equation
Revenue = CS
Since the number of subscribers changes with the price, we need to find a relationship
between the variables. We know that currently S = 84,000 and C = 30, and that if they
raise the price to $32 they would lose 5,000 subscribers, giving a second pair of values,
C = 32 and S = 79,000. From this we can find a linear equation relating the two
quantities. Treating C as the input and S as the output, the equation will have form
S  mC  b . The slope will be
79,000  84,000  5,000
m

 2,500
32  30
2
This tells us the paper will lose 2,500 subscribers for each dollar they raise the price.
We can then solve for the vertical intercept
S  2500C  b
84,000  2500(30)  b
b  159,000

Plug in the point S = 84,000 and C = 30
Solve for b

This gives us the linear equation S  2,500C  159,000 relating cost and subscribers.
We now return to our revenue equation.
Revenue  CS
Substituting the equation for S from above
Revenue  C(2,500C  159,000) Expanding

Revenue  2,500C 2  159,000C

168 Chapter 3
We now have a quadratic equation for revenue as a function of the subscription charge.
To find the price that will maximize revenue for the newspaper, we can find the vertex:
h

159,000
 31.8
2(2,500)

The model tells us that the maximum revenue will occur if the newspaper charges
$31.80 for a subscription. To find what the maximum revenue is, we can evaluate the
revenue equation:
Maximum Revenue =  2,500(31.8) 2  159,000(31.8)  $2,528,100

Short run Behavior: Intercepts
As with any function, we can find the vertical intercepts of a quadratic by evaluating the
function at an input of zero, and we can find the horizontal intercepts by solving for when
the output will be zero. Notice that depending upon the location of the graph, we might
have zero, one, or two horizontal intercepts.

zero horizontal intercepts

one horizontal intercept

two horizontal intercepts

Example 6
Find the vertical and horizontal intercepts of the quadratic f ( x)  3x 2  5x  2
We can find the vertical intercept by evaluating the function at an input of zero:
Vertical intercept at (0,-2)
f (0)  3(0) 2  5(0)  2  2
For the horizontal intercepts, we solve for when the output will be zero
0  3x 2  5 x  2
In this case, the quadratic can be factored easily, providing the simplest method for

The ball reaches a maximum height of 140 feet after 2.5 seconds.

3.2 Quadratic Functions 171
To find when the ball hits the ground, we need to determine when the height is zero –
when H(t) = 0. While we could do this using the transformation form of the quadratic,
we can also use the quadratic formula:

 80  80 2  4(16)(40)  80  8960
t

2(16)

 80  8960
t
 5.458 or

176 Chapter 3

Section 3.3 Graphs of Polynomial Functions
In the previous section we explored the short run behavior of quadratics, a special case of
polynomials. In this section we will explore the short run behavior of polynomials in
general.
Short run Behavior: Intercepts
As with any function, the vertical intercept can be found by evaluating the function at an
input of zero. Since this is evaluation, it is relatively easy to do it for a polynomial of any
degree.
To find horizontal intercepts, we need to solve for when the output will be zero. For
general polynomials, this can be a challenging prospect. While quadratics can be solved
using the relatively simple quadratic formula, the corresponding formulas for cubic and
4th degree polynomials are not simple enough to remember, and formulas do not exist for
general higher-degree polynomials. Consequently, we will limit ourselves to three cases:
1) The polynomial can be factored using known methods: greatest common
factor and trinomial factoring.
2) The polynomial is given in factored form.
3) Technology is used to determine the intercepts.
Example 1
Find the horizontal intercepts of f ( x)  x 6  3x 4  2 x 2 .
We can attempt to factor this polynomial to find solutions for f(x) = 0.
Factoring out the greatest common factor
x 6  3x 4  2 x 2  0

Factoring the inside as a quadratic in x2

This gives us 5 horizontal intercepts.
Example 2
Find the vertical and horizontal intercepts of g (t )  (t  2) 2 (2t  3)
The vertical intercept can be found by evaluating g(0).
g (0)  (0  2) 2 (2(0)  3)  12

3.3 Graphs of Polynomial Functions 177
The horizontal intercepts can be found by solving g(t) = 0
Since this is already factored, we can break it apart:
(t  2) 2 (2t  3)  0
2
(t  2)  0
(2t  3)  0
or
t20
3
t
t2

We can always check our answers are reasonable by graphing the polynomial.
Example 3
Find the horizontal intercepts of
h(t )  t 3  4t 2  t  6
Since this polynomial is not in factored form, has
no common factors, and does not appear to be
factorable using techniques we know, we can turn
to technology to find the intercepts.
Graphing this function, it appears there are
horizontal intercepts at t = -3, -2, and 1.
We could check these are correct by plugging in
these values for t and verifying that h(3)  h(2)  h(1)  0 .

Try it Now
1. Find the vertical and horizontal intercepts of the function f (t )  t 4  4t 2 .

Graphical Behavior at Intercepts
If we graph the function
f ( x)  ( x  3)( x  2) 2 ( x  1) 3 , notice that the
behavior at each of the horizontal intercepts is
different.
At the horizontal intercept x = -3, coming from
the ( x  3) factor of the polynomial, the graph
passes directly through the horizontal intercept.
The factor is linear (has a power of 1), so the
behavior near the intercept is like that of a line - it
passes directly through the intercept. We call this
a single zero, since the zero corresponds to a
single factor of the function.

178 Chapter 3
At the horizontal intercept x = 2, coming from the ( x  2) 2 factor of the polynomial, the
graph touches the axis at the intercept and changes direction. The factor is quadratic
(degree 2), so the behavior near the intercept is like that of a quadratic – it bounces off of
the horizontal axis at the intercept. Since ( x  2) 2  ( x  2)( x  2) , the factor is repeated
twice, so we call this a double zero. We could also say the zero has multiplicity 2.
At the horizontal intercept x = -1, coming from the ( x  1) 3 factor of the polynomial, the
graph passes through the axis at the intercept, but flattens out a bit first. This factor is
cubic (degree 3), so the behavior near the intercept is like that of a cubic, with the same
“S” type shape near the intercept that the toolkit x 3 has. We call this a triple zero. We
could also say the zero has multiplicity 3.
By utilizing these behaviors, we can sketch a reasonable graph of a factored polynomial
function without needing technology.
Graphical Behavior of Polynomials at Horizontal Intercepts
If a polynomial contains a factor of the form ( x  h) p , the behavior near the horizontal
intercept h is determined by the power on the factor.
p=1
p=2
p=3

Single zero
Multiplicity 1

Double zero
Multiplicity 2

Triple zero
Multiplicity 3

For higher even powers 4,6,8 etc.… the graph will still bounce off of the horizontal axis
but the graph will appear flatter with each increasing even power as it approaches and
leaves the axis.
For higher odd powers, 5,7,9 etc… the graph will still pass through the horizontal axis
but the graph will appear flatter with each increasing odd power as it approaches and
leaves the axis.
Example 4
Sketch a graph of f ( x)  2( x  3) 2 ( x  5) .
This graph has two horizontal intercepts. At x = -3, the factor is squared, indicating the
graph will bounce at this horizontal intercept. At x = 5, the factor is not squared,
indicating the graph will pass through the axis at this intercept.

3.3 Graphs of Polynomial Functions 179
Additionally, we can see the leading term, if this polynomial were multiplied out, would
be  2x 3 , so the long-run behavior is that of a vertically reflected cubic, with the
outputs decreasing as the inputs get large positive, and the inputs increasing as the
inputs get large negative.
To sketch this we consider the following:
As x   the function f (x)   so we know the graph starts in the 2nd quadrant
and is decreasing toward the horizontal axis.
At (-3, 0) the graph bounces off of the horizontal axis and so the function must start
increasing.
At (0, 90) the graph crosses the vertical axis at the vertical intercept.
Somewhere after this point, the graph must turn back down or start decreasing toward
the horizontal axis since the graph passes through the next intercept at (5,0).
As x   the function f (x)   so
we know the graph continues to decrease
and we can stop drawing the graph in the
4th quadrant.
Using technology we can verify that the
resulting graph will look like:

Solving Polynomial Inequalities
One application of our ability to find intercepts and sketch a graph of polynomials is the
ability to solve polynomial inequalities. It is a very common question to ask when a
function will be positive and negative. We can solve polynomial inequalities by either
utilizing the graph, or by using test values.
Example 5
Solve ( x  3)( x  1) 2 ( x  4)  0
As with all inequalities, we start by solving the equality ( x  3)( x  1) 2 ( x  4)  0 ,
which has solutions at x = -3, -1, and 4. We know the function can only change from
positive to negative at these values, so these divide the inputs into 4 intervals.

180 Chapter 3
We could choose a test value in each interval and evaluate the function
f ( x)  ( x  3)( x  1) 2 ( x  4) at each test value to determine if the function is positive or
negative in that interval
Interval
x < -3
-3 < x < -1
-1 < x < 4
x>4

Test x in interval
-4
-2
0

On a number line this would look like:

f( test value)
72
-6
-12
288

>0 or <0?
>0
<0
<0
>0

0 positive

From our test values, we can determine this function is positive when x < -3 or x > 4, or
in interval notation, (,3)  (4, )

We could have also determined on which intervals the function was positive by sketching
a graph of the function. We illustrate that technique in the next example
Example 6
Find the domain of the function v(t )  6  5t  t 2 .
A square root is only defined when the quantity we are taking the square root of, the
quantity inside the square root, is zero or greater. Thus, the domain of this function will
be when 6  5t  t 2  0 .
Again we start by solving the equality 6  5t  t 2  0 . While we could use the
quadratic formula, this equation factors nicely to (6  t )(1  t )  0 , giving horizontal
intercepts t = 1 and t = -6. Sketching a graph of this quadratic will allow us to
determine when it is positive.
From the graph we can see this function is positive
for inputs between the intercepts. So 6  5t  t 2  0
for  6  t  1 , and this will be the domain of the
v(t) function.

2. Given the function g ( x)  x 3  x 2  6 x use the methods that we have learned so far
to find the vertical & horizontal intercepts, determine where the function is negative and
positive, describe the long run behavior and sketch the graph without technology.
Writing Equations using Intercepts
Since a polynomial function written in factored form will have a horizontal intercept
where each factor is equal to zero, we can form a function that will pass through a set of
horizontal intercepts by introducing a corresponding set of factors.
Factored Form of Polynomials
If a polynomial has horizontal intercepts at x  x1 , x2 ,, xn , then the polynomial can be
written in the factored form
f ( x)  a( x  x1 ) p1 ( x  x2 ) p2 ( x  xn ) pn
where the powers pi on each factor can be determined by the behavior of the graph at
the corresponding intercept, and the stretch factor a can be determined given a value of
the function other than the horizontal intercept.
Example 7
Write a formula for the polynomial function graphed here.

This graph has three horizontal intercepts: x = -3, 2, and 5. At x = -3 and 5 the graph
passes through the axis, suggesting the corresponding factors of the polynomial will be
linear. At x = 2 the graph bounces at the intercept, suggesting the corresponding factor
of the polynomial will be 2nd degree (quadratic). Together, this gives us:
f ( x)  a( x  3)( x  2) 2 ( x  5)
To determine the stretch factor, we can utilize another point on the graph. Here, the
vertical intercept appears to be (0,-2), so we can plug in those values to solve for a:

3. Given the graph, write a formula for the function shown.

Estimating Extrema
With quadratics, we were able to algebraically find the maximum or minimum value of
the function by finding the vertex. For general polynomials, finding these turning points
is not possible without more advanced techniques from calculus. Even then, finding
where extrema occur can still be algebraically challenging. For now, we will estimate the
locations of turning points using technology to generate a graph.
Example 8
An open-top box is to be constructed by cutting out squares from each corner of a 14cm
by 20cm sheet of plastic then folding up the sides. Find the size of squares that should
be cut out to maximize the volume enclosed by the box.
w
We will start this problem by drawing a picture, labeling the
w
width of the cut-out squares with a variable, w.

3.3 Graphs of Polynomial Functions 183
Notice that after a square is cut out from each end, it leaves a (14-2w) cm by (20-2w)
cm rectangle for the base of the box, and the box will be w cm tall. This gives the
volume:
V (w)  (14  2w)(20  2w)w  280w  68w2  4w3
Using technology to sketch a graph allows us to estimate the maximum value for the
volume, restricted to reasonable values for w: values from 0 to 7.

From this graph, we can estimate the maximum value is around 340, and occurs when
the squares are about 2.75cm square. To improve this estimate, we could use advanced
features of our technology, if available, or simply change our window to zoom in on our
graph.

From this zoomed-in view, we can refine our estimate for the max volume to about 339,
when the squares are 2.7cm square.

Section 3.4 Rational Functions
In the last few sections, we have built polynomials based on the positive whole number
power functions. In this section we explore functions based on power functions with
negative integer powers, called rational functions.
Example 1
You plan to drive 100 miles. Find a formula for the time the trip will take as a function
of the speed you drive.
You may recall that multiplying speed by time will give you distance. If we let t
represent the drive time in hours, and v represent the velocity (speed or rate) at which
we drive, then vt  distance . Since our distance is fixed at 100 miles, vt  100 .
Solving this relationship for the time gives us the function we desired:
100
t (v ) 
 100v 1
v
While this type of relationship can be written using the negative exponent, it is more
common to see it written as a fraction.
This particular example is one of an inversely proportional relationship – where one
5
quantity is a constant divided by the other quantity, like y  .
x

Notice that this is a transformation of the reciprocal toolkit function, f ( x) 
x
Several natural phenomena, such as gravitational force and volume of sound, behave in a
manner inversely proportional to the square of another quantity. For example, the
k
volume, V, of a sound heard at a distance d from the source would be related by V  2
d
for some constant value k.

These functions are transformations of the reciprocal squared toolkit function f ( x)  2 .

We have seen the graphs of the basic reciprocal function and the squared reciprocal
function from our study of toolkit functions. These graphs have several important
features.

by zero is not allowed and therefore zero is not in the domain, and so the function is
undefined at an input of zero.
Let’s begin by looking at the reciprocal function, f ( x) 

Short run behavior:
As the input values approach zero from the left side (taking on very small, negative
values), the function values become very large in the negative direction (in other words,
they approach negative infinity).
We write: as x  0  , f (x)   .
As we approach zero from the right side (small, positive input values), the function
values become very large in the positive direction (approaching infinity).
We write: as x  0  , f (x)   .
This behavior creates a vertical asymptote. An asymptote is a line that the graph
approaches. In this case the graph is approaching the vertical line x = 0 as the input
becomes close to zero.
Long run behavior:
As the values of x approach infinity, the function values approach 0.
As the values of x approach negative infinity, the function values approach 0.
Symbolically: as x   , f ( x)  0
Based on this long run behavior and the graph we can see that the function approaches 0
but never actually reaches 0, it just “levels off” as the inputs become large. This behavior
creates a horizontal asymptote. In this case the graph is approaching the horizontal line
f ( x)  0 as the input becomes very large in the negative and positive directions.

Vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes
A vertical asymptote of a graph is a vertical line x = a where the graph tends towards
positive or negative infinity as the inputs approach a. As x  a , f (x)   .
A horizontal asymptote of a graph is a horizontal line y  b where the graph
approaches the line as the inputs get large. As x   , f ( x)  b .

undefined at x = -2, and the graph also is
showing a vertical asymptote at x = -2.
As x  2 , f ( x)   , and as
x  2 , f ( x)  
As the inputs grow large, the graph appears
to be leveling off at output values of 3,
indicating a horizontal asymptote at y  3 .
As x   , f ( x)  3 .

Example 3
A large mixing tank currently contains 100 gallons of water, into which 5 pounds of
sugar have been mixed. A tap will open pouring 10 gallons per minute of water into the
tank at the same time sugar is poured into the tank at a rate of 1 pound per minute. Find
the concentration (pounds per gallon) of sugar in the tank after t minutes.
Notice that the amount of water in the tank is changing linearly, as is the amount of
sugar in the tank. We can write an equation independently for each:

Finding Asymptotes and Intercepts
Given a rational function, as part of investigating the short run behavior we are interested
in finding any vertical and horizontal asymptotes, as well as finding any vertical or
horizontal intercepts, as we have done in the past.
To find vertical asymptotes, we notice that the vertical asymptotes in our examples occur
when the denominator of the function is undefined. With one exception, a vertical
asymptote will occur whenever the denominator is undefined.
Example 4

5  2x 2
Find the vertical asymptotes of the function k ( x) 
2  x  x2
To find the vertical asymptotes, we determine where this function will be undefined by
setting the denominator equal to zero:
2  x  x2  0
(2  x)(1  x)  0
x  2, 1

192 Chapter 3
This indicates two vertical asymptotes, which a
look at a graph confirms.

The exception to this rule can occur when both the numerator and denominator of a
rational function are zero at the same input.
Example 5
Find the vertical asymptotes of the function k ( x) 

x2
.
x2  4

To find the vertical asymptotes, we determine where this function will be undefined by
setting the denominator equal to zero:
x2  4  0

x2  4
x  2, 2
However, the numerator of this function is also
equal to zero when x = 2. Because of this, the
0
function will still be undefined at 2, since is
0
undefined, but the graph will not have a vertical
asymptote at x = 2.
The graph of this function will have the vertical
asymptote at x = -2, but at x = 2 the graph will
have a hole: a single point where the graph is not
defined, indicated by an open circle.
Vertical Asymptotes and Holes of Rational Functions
The vertical asymptotes of a rational function will occur where the denominator of the
function is equal to zero and the numerator is not zero.
A hole might occur in the graph of a rational function if an input causes both numerator
and denominator to be zero. In this case, factor the numerator and denominator and
simplify; if the simplified expression still has a zero in the denominator at the original
input the original function has a vertical asymptote at the input, otherwise it has a hole.

3.4 Rational Functions 193
To find horizontal asymptotes, we are interested in the behavior of the function as the
input grows large, so we consider long run behavior of the numerator and denominator
separately. Recall that a polynomial’s long run behavior will mirror that of the leading
term. Likewise, a rational function’s long run behavior will mirror that of the ratio of the
leading terms of the numerator and denominator functions.
There are three distinct outcomes when this analysis is done:
Case 1: The degree of the denominator > degree of the numerator
3x  2
Example: f ( x)  2
x  4x  5
3x 3
In this case, the long run behavior is f ( x)  2  . This tells us that as the inputs grow
x
x
3
large, this function will behave similarly to the function g ( x)  . As the inputs grow
x
large, the outputs will approach zero, resulting in a horizontal asymptote at y  0 .
As x   , f ( x)  0

Case 2: The degree of the denominator < degree of the numerator
3x 2  2
Example: f ( x) 
x5
3x 2
 3x . This tells us that as the inputs
In this case, the long run behavior is f ( x) 
x
grow large, this function will behave similarly to the function g ( x)  3x . As the inputs
grow large, the outputs will grow and not level off, so this graph has no horizontal
asymptote.
As x   , f (x)   , respectively.
Ultimately, if the numerator is larger than the denominator, the long run behavior of the
graph will mimic the behavior of the reduced long run behavior fraction. As another
3x5  x 2
example if we had the function f ( x) 
with long run behavior
x3
3x5
f ( x) 
 3x 4 , the long run behavior of the graph would look similar to that of an
x
even polynomial, and as x   , f (x)   .

Case 3: The degree of the denominator = degree of the numerator
3x 2  2
Example: f ( x)  2
x  4x  5

194 Chapter 3
3x 2
 3 . This tells us that as the inputs grow
x2
large, this function will behave like the function g ( x)  3 , which is a horizontal line. As
x   , f ( x)  3 , resulting in a horizontal asymptote at y  3 .

In this case, the long run behavior is f ( x) 

Horizontal Asymptote of Rational Functions
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function can be determined by looking at the
degrees of the numerator and denominator.
Degree of denominator > degree of numerator: Horizontal asymptote at y  0
Degree of denominator < degree of numerator: No horizontal asymptote
Degree of denominator = degree of numerator: Horizontal asymptote at ratio of leading
coefficients.
Example 6
In the sugar concentration problem from earlier, we created the equation
5t
.
C (t ) 
100  10t
Find the horizontal asymptote and interpret it in context of the scenario.
Both the numerator and denominator are linear (degree 1), so since the degrees are
equal, there will be a horizontal asymptote at the ratio of the leading coefficients. In the
numerator, the leading term is t, with coefficient 1. In the denominator, the leading
term is 10t, with coefficient 10. The horizontal asymptote will be at the ratio of these
1
values: As t   , C (t )  . This function will have a horizontal asymptote at
10
1
y .
10
This tells us that as the input gets large, the output values will approach 1/10. In
context, this means that as more time goes by, the concentration of sugar in the tank will
approach one tenth of a pound of sugar per gallon of water or 1/10 pounds per gallon.
Example 7
Find the horizontal and vertical asymptotes of the function
( x  2)( x  3)
f ( x) 
( x  1)( x  2)( x  5)
First, note this function has no inputs that make both the numerator and denominator
zero, so there are no potential holes. The function will have vertical asymptotes when
the denominator is zero, causing the function to be undefined. The denominator will be
zero at x = 1, -2, and 5, indicating vertical asymptotes at these values.

3.4 Rational Functions 195
The numerator has degree 2, while the denominator has degree 3. Since the degree of
the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator, the denominator will grow
faster than the numerator, causing the outputs to tend towards zero as the inputs get
large, and so as x   , f ( x)  0 . This function will have a horizontal asymptote at
y  0.

(2 x  1)(2 x  1)

Intercepts
As with all functions, a rational function will have a vertical intercept when the input is
zero, if the function is defined at zero. It is possible for a rational function to not have a
vertical intercept if the function is undefined at zero.
Likewise, a rational function will have horizontal intercepts at the inputs that cause the
output to be zero (unless that input corresponds to a hole). It is possible there are no
horizontal intercepts. Since a fraction is only equal to zero when the numerator is zero,
horizontal intercepts will occur when the numerator of the rational function is equal to
zero.
Example 8

write this as a rational function and find the horizontal and vertical intercepts and the
horizontal and vertical asymptotes.

196 Chapter 3
From the previous example, you probably noticed that the numerator of a rational
function reveals the horizontal intercepts of the graph, while the denominator reveals the
vertical asymptotes of the graph. As with polynomials, factors of the numerator may
have integer powers greater than one. Happily, the effect on the shape of the graph at
those intercepts is the same as we saw with polynomials.
When factors of the denominator have integer powers greater than one, the behavior at
the corresponding vertical asymptote will mirror one of the two toolkit reciprocal
functions.
We get this behavior when the degree of the factor in the
denominator is odd. The distinguishing characteristic is that
on one side of the vertical asymptote the graph heads towards
positive infinity, and on the other side the graph heads
towards negative infinity.

We get this behavior when the degree of the factor in the
denominator is even. The distinguishing characteristic is
that the graph either heads toward positive infinity on both
sides of the vertical asymptote, or heads toward negative
infinity on both sides.

For example, the graph of
( x  1) 2 ( x  3)
f ( x) 
is shown here.
( x  3) 2 ( x  2)
At the horizontal intercept x = -1
corresponding to the ( x  1) 2 factor of
the numerator, the graph bounces at the
intercept, consistent with the quadratic
nature of the factor.
At the horizontal intercept x = 3 corresponding to the ( x  3) factor of the numerator, the
graph passes through the axis as we’d expect from a linear factor.
At the vertical asymptote x = -3 corresponding to the ( x  3) 2 factor of the denominator,
the graph heads towards positive infinity on both sides of the asymptote, consistent with
1
the behavior of the 2 toolkit.

3.4 Rational Functions 197
At the vertical asymptote x = 2 corresponding to the ( x  2) factor of the denominator,

Example 9
Sketch a graph of f ( x) 

( x  2)( x  3)
.
( x  1) 2 ( x  2)

We can start our sketch by finding intercepts and asymptotes. Evaluating the function
at zero gives the vertical intercept:
(0  2)(0  3)
f (0) 
3
(0  1) 2 (0  2)
Looking at when the numerator of the function is zero, we can determine the graph will
have horizontal intercepts at x = -2 and x = 3. At each, the behavior will be linear, with
the graph passing through the intercept.
Looking at when the denominator of the function is zero, we can determine the graph
will have vertical asymptotes at x = -1 and x = 2.
Finally, the degree of denominator is larger than the degree of the numerator, telling us
this graph has a horizontal asymptote at y = 0.
To sketch the graph, we might start by plotting the
three intercepts. Since the graph has no horizontal
intercepts between the vertical asymptotes, and the
vertical intercept is positive, we know the function
must remain positive between the asymptotes,
letting us fill in the middle portion of the graph.
Since the factor associated with the vertical
asymptote at x = -1 was squared, we know the
graph will have the same behavior on both sides
of the asymptote. Since the graph heads towards
positive infinity as the inputs approach the
asymptote on the right, the graph will head
towards positive infinity on the left as well. For
the vertical asymptote at x = 2, the factor was not
squared, so the graph will have opposite behavior
on either side of the asymptote.
After passing through the horizontal intercepts, the graph will then level off towards an
output of zero, as indicated by the horizontal asymptote.

5. Given the function f ( x) 

Since a rational function written in factored form will have a horizontal intercept where
each factor of the numerator is equal to zero, we can form a numerator that will pass
through a set of horizontal intercepts by introducing a corresponding set of factors.
Likewise, since the function will have a vertical asymptote where each factor of the
denominator is equal to zero, we can form a denominator that will produce the vertical
asymptotes by introducing a corresponding set of factors.
Writing Rational Functions from Intercepts and Asymptotes
If a rational function has horizontal intercepts at x  x1 , x2 ,, xn , and vertical
asymptotes at x  v1 , v2 ,, vm then the function can be written in the form

( x  x1 ) p1 ( x  x 2 ) p2 ( x  x n ) pn
f ( x)  a
( x  v1 ) q1 ( x  v2 ) q2 ( x  vm ) qn
where the powers pi or qi on each factor can be determined by the behavior of the graph
at the corresponding intercept or asymptote, and the stretch factor a can be determined
given a value of the function other than the horizontal intercept, or by the horizontal
asymptote if it is nonzero.
Example 10
Write an equation for the rational function
graphed here.
The graph appears to have horizontal
intercepts at x = -2 and x = 3. At both, the
graph passes through the intercept, suggesting
linear factors.
The graph has two vertical asymptotes. The
one at x = -1 seems to exhibit the basic
1
behavior similar to , with the graph heading toward positive infinity on one side and
x
heading toward negative infinity on the other. The asymptote at x = 2 is exhibiting a
1
behavior similar to 2 , with the graph heading toward negative infinity on both sides

particular the radical functions that arise in the process.
Example 1
A water runoff collector is built in the shape of a parabolic trough as shown below.
Find the surface area of the water in the trough as a function of the depth of the water.
3ft

12 in

18 in

Since it will be helpful to have an equation for the parabolic cross-sectional shape, we
will impose a coordinate system at the cross section, with x measured horizontally and y
measured vertically, with the origin at the vertex of the parabola.
y

x

From this we find an equation for the parabolic shape. Since we placed the origin at the
vertex of the parabola, we know the equation will have form y( x)  ax 2 . Our equation
will need to pass through the point (6,18), from which we can solve for the stretch
factor a:
18  a6 2
18 1
a

36 2

Our parabolic cross section has equation y ( x)  x 2

Since we are interested in the surface area of the water, we are interested in determining
the width at the top of the water as a function of the water depth. For any depth y the
width will be given by 2x, so we need to solve the equation above for x. However
notice that the original function is not one-to-one, and indeed given any output there are
two inputs that produce the same output, one positive and one negative.

3.5 Inverses and Radical Functions 207
To find an inverse, we can restrict our original function to a limited domain on which it
is one-to-one. In this case, it makes sense to restrict ourselves to positive x values. On
this domain, we can find an inverse by solving for the input variable:
1
y  x2
2
2y  x2

x   2y
This is not a function as written. Since we are limiting ourselves to positive x values,
we eliminate the negative solution, giving us the inverse function we’re looking for
x( y )  2 y
Since x measures from the center out, the entire width of the water at the top will be 2x.
Since the trough is 3 feet (36 inches) long, the surface area will then be 36(2x), or in
terms of y:
Area  72 x  72 2 y

The previous example illustrated two important things:
1) When finding the inverse of a quadratic, we have to limit ourselves to a domain
on which the function is one-to-one.
2) The inverse of a quadratic function is a square root function. Both are toolkit
functions and different types of power functions.
Functions involving roots are often called radical functions.
Example 2
Find the inverse of f ( x)  ( x  2)2  3  x 2  4 x  1
From the transformation form of the function, we can see this is a transformed quadratic
with vertex at (2,-3) that opens upwards. Since the graph will be decreasing on one
side of the vertex, and increasing on the other side, we can restrict this function to a
domain on which it will be one-to-one by limiting the domain to x  2 .
To find the inverse, we will use the vertex form of the quadratic. We start by replacing
the f(x) with a simple variable y, then solve for x.
Add 3 to both sides
y  ( x  2) 2  3
2
Take the square root
y  3  ( x  2)

 y3x2
2 y 3  x

Add 2 to both sides

208 Chapter 3
Of course, as written this is not a function. Since we restricted our original function to a
domain of x  2 , the outputs of the inverse should be the same, telling us to utilize the
+ case:
x  f 1 ( y)  2  y  3
If the quadratic had not been given in vertex form, rewriting it into vertex form is
probably the best approach. Alternatively, we could have taken the standard equation
and rewritten it equal to zero:
0  x 2  4x  1  y
We would then be able to use the quadratic formula with a  1 , b  4 , and c  (1  y) ,
resulting in the same solutions we found above:

x

(4)  (4)2  4(1)(1  y)
12  4 y
 2

1. Find the inverse of the function f ( x)  x 2  1 , on the domain x  0 .

While it is not possible to find an inverse of most polynomial functions, some other basic
polynomials are invertible.
Example 3
Find the inverse of the function f ( x)  5x 3  1 .
This is a transformation of the basic cubic toolkit function, and based on our knowledge
of that function, we know it is one-to-one. Solving for the inverse by solving for x
y  5x 3  1
y  1  5x 3
y 1
 x3

x  f 1 ( y )  3

Notice that this inverse is also a transformation of a power function with a fractional
power, x1/3.

2. Which toolkit functions have inverse functions without restricting their domain?

3.5 Inverses and Radical Functions 209
Besides being important as an inverse function, radical functions are common in
important physical models.
Example 4
The velocity, v in feet per second, of a car that slammed on its brakes can be determined
based on the length of skid marks that the tires left on the ground. This relationship is
given by
v(d )  2 gfd
In this formula, g represents acceleration due to gravity (32 ft/sec2), d is the length of
the skid marks in feet, and f is a constant representing the friction of the surface. A car
lost control on wet asphalt, with a friction coefficient of 0.5, leaving 200 foot skid
marks. How fast was the car travelling when it lost control?
Using the given values of f = 0.5 and d = 200, we can evaluate the given formula:
v(200)  2(32)(0.5)(200)  80 ft/sec , which is about 54.5 miles per hour.

When radical functions are composed with other functions, determining domain can
become more complicated.
Example 5
Find the domain of the function f ( x) 

( x  2)( x  3)
.
( x  1)

Since a square root is only defined when the quantity under the radical is non-negative,
( x  2)( x  3)
 0 . A rational function can change signs
we need to determine where
( x  1)
(change from positive to negative or vice versa) at horizontal intercepts and at vertical
asymptotes. For this equation, the graph could change signs at x = -2, 1, and 3.
To determine on which intervals the rational expression is positive, we could evaluate
the expression at test values, or sketch a graph. While both approaches work equally
well, for this example we will use a graph.
This function has two horizontal intercepts, both of which exhibit linear behavior,
where the graph will pass through the intercept. There is one vertical asymptote,
corresponding to a linear factor, leading to a behavior similar to the basic reciprocal
toolkit function. There is a vertical intercept at (0, 6). This graph does not have a
horizontal asymptote, since the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the
denominator.

210 Chapter 3
From the vertical intercept and horizontal intercept at x = -2, we can sketch the left side
of the graph. From the behavior at the asymptote, we can sketch the right side of the
graph.

From the graph, we can now tell on which
intervals this expression will be non-negative,
so the original function f(x) will be defined.
f(x) has domain  2  x  1 or x  3 , or in
interval notation, [2,1)  [3, ) .

Like with finding inverses of quadratic functions, it is sometimes desirable to find the
inverse of a rational function, particularly of rational functions that are the ratio of linear
functions, such as our concentration examples.
Example 6

20  0.4n
was used in the previous section to represent the
100  n
concentration of an acid solution after n mL of 40% solution has been added to 100 mL
of a 20% solution. We might want to be able to determine instead how much 40%
solution has been added based on the current concentration of the mixture.
The function C (n) 

To do this, we would want the inverse of this function:
20  0.4n
multiply both sides by the denominator
C
100  n
distribute
C (100  n)  20  0.4n
group everything with n on one side
100C  Cn  20  0.4n
factor out n
100C  20  0.4n  Cn
divide to find the inverse
100C  20  (0.4  C )n
100C  20
n(C ) 
0.4  C
If, for example, we wanted to know how many mL of 40% solution need to be added to
obtain a concentration of 35%, we can simply evaluate the inverse rather than solving
an equation involving the original function:
100(0.35)  20
15
n(0.35) 

 300 mL of 40% solution would need to be added.

Section 4.1 Exponential Functions
India is the second most populous country in the world, with a population in 2008 of
about 1.14 billion people. The population is growing by about 1.34% each year1. We
might ask if we can find a formula to model the population, P, as a function of time, t, in
years after 2008, if the population continues to grow at this rate.
In linear growth, we had a constant rate of change – a constant number that the output
increased for each increase in input. For example, in the equation f ( x)  3x  4 , the
slope tells us the output increases by three each time the input increases by one. This
population scenario is different – we have a percent rate of change rather than a constant
number of people as our rate of change. To see the significance of this difference
consider these two companies:
Company A has 100 stores, and expands by opening 50 new stores a year
Company B has 100 stores, and expands by increasing the number of stores by 50% of
their total each year.
Looking at a few years of growth for these companies:
Year

Stores, company A

Starting with 100 each

100 + 50 = 150

stores in the first year.

100 + 50% of 100
100 + 0.50(100) = 150

2

150 + 50 = 200

Store A grows by 50,
Store B grows by 75

150 + 50% of 150
150 + 0.50(150) = 225

3

200 + 50 = 250

Store A grows by 50,
Store B grows by 112.5

225 + 50% of 225
225 + 0.50(225) = 337.5

216 Chapter 4
Notice that with the percent growth, each year the company is grows by 50% of the
current year’s total, so as the company grows larger, the number of stores added in a year
grows as well.
To try to simplify the calculations, notice that after 1 year the number of stores for
company B was:
or equivalently by factoring
100  0.50(100)
100(1  0.50)  150
We can think of this as “the new number of stores is the original 100% plus another
50%”.
After 2 years, the number of stores was:
or equivalently by factoring
150  0.50(150)
now recall the 150 came from 100(1+0.50). Substituting that,
150(1  0.50)

100(1  0.50)(1  0.50)  100(1  0.50) 2  225
After 3 years, the number of stores was:
or equivalently by factoring
225  0.50(225)
now recall the 225 came from 100(1  0.50) 2 . Substituting that,
225(1  0.50)

100(1  0.50) 2 (1  0.50)  100(1  0.50) 3  337.5
From this, we can generalize, noticing that to show a 50% increase, each year we
multiply by a factor of (1+0.50), so after n years, our equation would be
B(n)  100(1  0.50) n
In this equation, the 100 represented the initial quantity, and the 0.50 was the percent
growth rate. Generalizing further, we arrive at the general form of exponential functions.
Exponential Function
An exponential growth or decay function is a function that grows or shrinks at a
constant percent growth rate. The equation can be written in the form
f ( x)  a(1  r ) x or
f ( x)  ab x where b = 1+r
Where
a is the initial or starting value of the function
r is the percent growth or decay rate, written as a decimal
b is the growth factor or growth multiplier. Since powers of negative numbers behave
strangely, we limit b to positive values.
To see more clearly the difference between exponential and linear growth, compare the
two tables and graphs below, which illustrate the growth of company A and B described
above over a longer time frame if the growth patterns were to continue

Example 1
Write an exponential function for India’s population, and use it to predict the population
in 2020.
At the beginning of the chapter we were given India’s population of 1.14 billion in the
year 2008 and a percent growth rate of 1.34%. Using 2008 as our starting time (t = 0),
our initial population will be 1.14 billion. Since the percent growth rate was 1.34%, our
value for r is 0.0134.
Using the basic formula for exponential growth f ( x)  a(1  r ) x we can write the
formula, f (t )  1.14(1  0.0134) t
To estimate the population in 2020, we evaluate the function at t = 12, since 2020 is 12
years after 2008.
f (12)  1.14(1  0.0134)12  1.337 billion people in 2020

B. State employees can expect a $300 raise each year they work for the state.
C. Tuition costs have increased by 2.8% each year for the last 3 years.
Example 2
A certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of savings account offered by banks, typically
offering a higher interest rate in return for a fixed length of time you will leave your
money invested. If a bank offers a 24 month CD with an annual interest rate of 1.2%
compounded monthly, how much will a $1000 investment grow to over those 24
months?
First, we must notice that the interest rate is an annual rate, but is compounded monthly,
meaning interest is calculated and added to the account monthly. To find the monthly
interest rate, we divide the annual rate of 1.2% by 12 since there are 12 months in a

218 Chapter 4
year: 1.2%/12 = 0.1%. Each month we will earn 0.1% interest. From this, we can set
up an exponential function, with our initial amount of $1000 and a growth rate of r =
0.001, and our input m measured in months.

In all the preceding examples, we saw exponential growth. Exponential functions can
also be used to model quantities that are decreasing at a constant percent rate. An
example of this is radioactive decay, a process in which radioactive isotopes of certain
atoms transform to an atom of a different type, causing a percentage decrease of the
original material over time.
Example 3
Bismuth-210 is an isotope that radioactively decays by about 13% each day, meaning
13% of the remaining Bismuth-210 transforms into another atom (polonium-210 in this
case) each day. If you begin with 100 mg of Bismuth-210, how much remains after one
week?
With radioactive decay, instead of the quantity increasing at a percent rate, the quantity
is decreasing at a percent rate. Our initial quantity is a = 100 mg, and our growth rate
will be negative 13%, since we are decreasing: r = -0.13. This gives the equation:
Q(d )  100(1  0.13) d  100(0.87) d
This can also be explained by recognizing that if 13% decays, then 87 % remains.
After one week, 7 days, the quantity remaining would be
Q(7)  100(0.87) 7  37.73 mg of Bismuth-210 remains.

Example 4
T(q) represents the total number of Android smart phone contracts, in thousands, held
by a certain Verizon store region measured quarterly since January 1, 2010,
Interpret all of the parts of the equation T (2)  86(1.64) 2  231.3056 .
Interpreting this from the basic exponential form, we know that 86 is our initial value.
This means that on Jan. 1, 2010 this region had 86,000 Android smart phone contracts.
Since b = 1 + r = 1.64, we know that every quarter the number of smart phone contracts
grows by 64%. T(2) = 231.3056 means that in the 2nd quarter (or at the end of the
second quarter) there were approximately 231,305 Android smart phone contracts.
Finding Equations of Exponential Functions
In the previous examples, we were able to write equations for exponential functions since
we knew the initial quantity and the growth rate. If we do not know the growth rate, but
instead know only some input and output pairs of values, we can still construct an
exponential function.
Example 5
In 2002, 80 deer were reintroduced into a wildlife refuge area from which the
population had previously been hunted to elimination. By 2008, the population had
grown to 180 deer. If this population grows exponentially, find a formula for the
function.
By defining our input variable to be t, years after 2002, the information listed can be
written as two input-output pairs: (0,80) and (6,180). Notice that by choosing our input
variable to be measured as years after the first year value provided, we have effectively
“given” ourselves the initial value for the function: a = 80. This gives us an equation
of the form
f (t )  80b t .
Substituting in our second input-output pair allows us to solve for b:
180  80b6
Divide by 80
180 9
b6 

Take the 6th root of both sides.
80 4
9
b  6  1.1447
4
This gives us our equation for the population:
f (t )  80(1.1447) t
Recall that since b = 1+r, we can interpret this to mean that the population growth rate
is r = 0.1447, and so the population is growing by about 14.47% each year.
In this example, you could also have used (9/4)^(1/6) to evaluate the 6th root if your
calculator doesn’t have an nth root button.

220 Chapter 4
In the previous example, we chose to use the f ( x)  ab x form of the exponential
function rather than the f ( x)  a(1  r ) x form. This choice was entirely arbitrary – either
form would be fine to use.
When finding equations, the value for b or r will usually have to be rounded to be written
easily. To preserve accuracy, it is important to not over-round these values. Typically,
you want to be sure to preserve at least 3 significant digits in the growth rate. For
example, if your value for b was 1.00317643, you would want to round this no further
than to 1.00318.
In the previous example, we were able to “give” ourselves the initial value by clever
definition of our input variable. Next we consider a situation where we can’t do this.
Example 6
Find a formula for an exponential function passing through the points (-2,6) and (2,1).
Since we don’t have the initial value, we will take a general approach that will work for
any function form with unknown parameters: we will substitute in both given inputoutput pairs in the function form f ( x)  ab x and solve for the unknown values, a and b.
Substituting in (-2, 6) gives 6  ab 2
Substituting in (2, 1) gives 1  ab 2
We now solve these as a system of equations. To do so, we could try a substitution

Compound Interest
In the bank certificate of deposit (CD) example earlier in the section, we encountered
compound interest. Typically bank accounts and other savings instruments in which
earnings are reinvested, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, utilize compound
interest. The term compounding comes from the behavior that interest is earned not on
the original value, but on the accumulated value of the account.
In the example from earlier, the interest was compounded monthly, so we took the annual
interest rate, usually called the nominal rate or annual percentage rate (APR) and
divided by 12, the number of compounds in a year, to find the monthly interest. The
exponent was then measured in months.
Generalizing this, we can form a general formula for compound interest. If the APR is
written in decimal form as r, and there are k compounding periods per year, then the
interest per compounding period will be r/k. Likewise, if we are interested in the value
after t years, then there will be kt compounding periods in that time.
Compound Interest Formula
Compound Interest can be calculated using the formula
kt

 r
A(t )  a1  
 k
Where
A(t) is the account value
t is measured in years
a is the starting amount of the account, often called the principal
r is the annual percentage rate (APR), also called the nominal rate
k is the number of compounding periods in one year

Example 8
If you invest $3,000 in an investment account paying 3% interest compounded
quarterly, how much will the account be worth in 10 years?
Since we are starting with $3000, a = 3000
Our interest rate is 3%, so r = 0.03
Since we are compounding quarterly, we are compounding 4 times per year, so k = 4
We want to know the value of the account in 10 years, so we are looking for A(10), the
value when t = 10.

Example 9
A 529 plan is a college savings plan in which a relative can invest money to pay for a
child’s later college tuition, and the account grows tax free. If Lily wants to set up a
529 account for her new granddaughter, wants the account to grow to $40,000 over 18
years, and she believes the account will earn 6% compounded semi-annually (twice a
year), how much will Lily need to invest in the account now?
Since the account is earning 6%, r = 0.06
Since interest is compounded twice a year, k = 2
In this problem, we don’t know how much we are starting with, so we will be solving
for a, the initial amount needed. We do know we want the end amount to be $40,000,
so we will be looking for the value of a so that A(18) = 40,000.

5. Recalculate example 2 from above with quarterly compounding.
Because of compounding throughout the year, with compound interest the actual increase
in a year is more than the annual percentage rate. If $1,000 were invested at 10%, the
table below shows the value after 1 year at different compounding frequencies:
Frequency
Annually
Semiannually
Quarterly
Monthly
Daily

Value after 1 year
$1100
$1102.50
$1103.81
$1104.71
$1105.16

If we were to compute the actual percentage increase for the daily compounding, there
was an increase of $105.16 from an original amount of $1,000, for a percentage increase
105.16
 0.10516 = 10.516% increase. This quantity is called the annual percentage
of
1000
yield (APY).

224 Chapter 4
Notice that given any starting amount, the amount after 1 year would be
k

 r
A(1)  a1   . To find the total change, we would subtract the original amount, then

to find the percentage change we would divide that by the original amount:

Notice this is equivalent to finding the value of $1 after 1 year, and subtracting the

account paying 1.1% compounded monthly. Which is offering a better rate?
We can compare these rates using the annual percentage yield – the actual percent
increase in a year.

Bank B’s monthly compounding is not enough to catch up with Bank A’s better APR.
Bank A offers a better rate.
A Limit to Compounding
As we saw earlier, the amount we earn increases as we increase the compounding
frequency. The table, though, shows that the increase from annual to semi-annual
compounding is larger than the increase from monthly to daily compounding. This might
lead us to believe that although increasing the frequency of compounding will increase
our result, there is an upper limit to this process.

Section 4.1 Exponential Functions 225

e is the letter used to represent the value that 1   approaches as k gets big.

Because e is often used as the base of an exponential, most scientific and graphing
calculators have a button that can calculate powers of e, usually labeled ex. Some
computer software instead defines a function exp(x), where exp(x) = ex.
Because e arises when the time between compounds becomes very small, e allows us to
define continuous growth and allows us to define a new toolkit function, f ( x)  e x .

Continuous Growth Formula
Continuous Growth can be calculated using the formula
f ( x)  ae rx
where
a is the starting amount
r is the continuous growth rate
This type of equation is commonly used when describing quantities that change more or
less continuously, like chemical reactions, growth of large populations, and radioactive
decay.

226 Chapter 4
Example 11
Radon-222 decays at a continuous rate of 17.3% per day. How much will 100mg of
Radon-222 decay to in 3 days?
Since we are given a continuous decay rate, we use the continuous growth formula.
Since the substance is decaying, we know the growth rate will be negative: r = -0.173
f (3)  100e 0.173(3)  59.512 mg of Radon-222 will remain.

6. Interpret the following: S (t )  20e0.12t if S(t) represents the growth of a substance in
grams, and time is measured in days.
Continuous growth is also often applied to compound interest, allowing us to talk about
continuous compounding.
Example 12
If $1000 is invested in an account earning 10% compounded continuously, find the
value after 1 year.
Here, the continuous growth rate is 10%, so r = 0.10. We start with $1000, so a = 1000.
To find the value after 1 year,
f (1)  1000e 0.10(1)  $1105.17
Notice this is a $105.17 increase for the year. As a percent increase, this is
105.17
 0.10517  10.517% increase over the original $1000.
1000
Notice that this value is slightly larger than the amount generated by daily compounding
in the table computed earlier.
The continuous growth rate is like the nominal growth rate (or APR) – it reflects the
growth rate before compounding takes effect. This is different than the annual growth
rate used in the formula f ( x)  a(1  r ) x , which is like the annual percentage yield – it
reflects the actual amount the output grows in a year.
While the continuous growth rate in the example above was 10%, the actual annual yield
was 10.517%. This means we could write two different looking but equivalent formulas
for this account’s growth:
f (t )  1000e0.10t
using the 10% continuous growth rate
t
f (t )  1000(1.10517)
using the 10.517% actual annual yield rate.

Section 4.2 Graphs of Exponential Functions
Like with linear functions, the graph of an exponential function is determined by the
values for the parameters in the function’s formula.

2) As x increases, the function grows faster and faster (the rate of change
increases).
3) As x decreases, the function values grow smaller, approaching zero.
4) This is an example of exponential growth.

Note this function is also positive for all values of x, but in this case grows as x decreases,

Looking at the graphs also confirms this relationship:

Section 4.2 Graphs of Exponential Functions 233
Consider a function for the form f ( x)  ab x . Since a, which we called the initial value
in the last section, is the function value at an input of zero, a will give us the vertical
intercept of the graph. From the graphs above, we can see that an exponential graph will
have a horizontal asymptote on one side of the graph, and can either increase or decrease,
depending upon the growth factor. This horizontal asymptote will also help us determine
the long run behavior and is easy to determine from the graph.
The graph will grow when the growth rate is positive, which will make the growth factor
b larger than one. When it’s negative, the growth factor will be less than one.
Graphical Features of Exponential Functions
Graphically, in the function f ( x)  ab x
a is the vertical intercept of the graph
b determines the rate at which the graph grows. When a is positive,
the function will increase if b > 1
the function will decrease if 0 < b < 1
The graph will have a horizontal asymptote at y = 0
The graph will be concave up if a > 0; concave down if a < 0.
The domain of the function is all real numbers
The range of the function is (0, )

When sketching the graph of an exponential function, it can be helpful to remember that
the graph will pass through the points (0, a) and (1, ab).
The value b will determine the function’s long run behavior:
If b > 1, as x   , f (x)   and as x   , f ( x)  0 .
If 0 < b < 1, as x   , f ( x)  0 and as x   , f (x)   .

pass through the point 1,  . Since b < 1, the graph

will be decreasing towards zero. Since a > 0, the graph
will be concave up.
We can also see from the graph the long run behavior:
as x   , f ( x)  0 and as x   , f (x)   .

234 Chapter 4
To get a better feeling for the effect of a and b on the graph, examine the sets of graphs
below. The first set shows various graphs, where a remains the same and we only change
the value for b.

Notice that changing the value for a changes the vertical intercept. Since a is multiplying
the bx term, a acts as a vertical stretch factor, not as a shift. Notice also that the long run
behavior for all of these functions is the same because the growth factor did not change
and none of these a values introduced a vertical flip.

g ( x)  2(1.8) x

k ( x)  4(0.7) x

The graph of k(x) is the easiest to identify, since it is the only equation with a growth
factor less than one, which will produce a decreasing graph. The graph of h(x) can be
identified as the only growing exponential function with a vertical intercept at (0,4).
The graphs of f(x) and g(x) both have a vertical intercept at (0,2), but since g(x) has a
larger growth factor, we can identify it as the graph increasing faster.

Transformations of Exponential Graphs
While exponential functions can be transformed following the same rules as any function,
there are a few interesting features of transformations that can be identified. The first
was seen at the beginning of the section – that a horizontal reflection is equivalent to a
change in the growth factor. Likewise, since a is itself a stretch factor, a vertical stretch
of an exponential corresponds with a change in the initial value of the function.

236 Chapter 4
Next consider the effect of a horizontal shift on an exponential function. Shifting the
function f ( x)  3(2) x four units to the left would give f ( x  4)  3(2) x4 . Employing
exponent rules, we could rewrite this:
f ( x  4)  3(2) x4  3(2) x (2 4 )  48(2) x
Interestingly, it turns out that a horizontal shift of an exponential function corresponds
with a change in initial value of the function.
Lastly, consider the effect of a vertical shift on an exponential function. Shifting
f ( x)  3(2) x down 4 units would give the equation f ( x)  3(2) x  4 , yielding the graph

Notice that this graph is substantially different than the basic exponential graph. Unlike a
basic exponential, this graph does not have a horizontal asymptote at y = 0; due to the
vertical shift, the horizontal asymptote has also shifted to y = -4. We can see that as
x   , f ( x)   and as x   , f ( x)  4 .
We have determined that a vertical shift is the only transformation of an exponential
function that changes the graph in a way that cannot be achieved by altering the
parameters a and b in the basic exponential function f ( x)  ab x .

Transformations of Exponentials
Any transformed exponential can be written in the form
f ( x)  ab x  c
where
y = c is the horizontal asymptote.
Note that, due to the shift, the vertical intercept is shifted to (0, a+c).

Section 4.3 Logarithmic Functions
A population of 50 flies is expected to double every week, leading to a function of the
form f ( x)  50(2) x , where x represents the number of weeks that have passed. When
will this population reach 500? Trying to solve this problem leads to:
Dividing both sides by 50 to isolate the exponential
500  50(2) x
10  2 x

While we have set up exponential models and used them to make predictions, you may
have noticed that solving exponential equations has not yet been mentioned. The reason
is simple: none of the algebraic tools discussed so far are sufficient to solve exponential
equations. Consider the equation 2 x  10 above. We know that 2 3  8 and 2 4  16 , so
it is clear that x must be some value between 3 and 4 since g ( x)  2 x is increasing. We
could use technology to create a table of values or graph to better estimate the solution.

From the graph, we could better estimate the solution to be around 3.3. This result is still
fairly unsatisfactory, and since the exponential function is one-to-one, it would be great
to have an inverse function. None of the functions we have already discussed would
serve as an inverse function and so we must introduce a new function, named log as the
inverse of an exponential function. Since exponential functions have different bases, we
will define corresponding logarithms of different bases as well.
Logarithm
The logarithm (base b) function, written log b x  , is the inverse of the exponential
function (base b), b x .
Since the logarithm and exponential are inverses, it follows that:
Properties of Logs: Inverse Properties
log b b x   x

b logb x  x

Section 4.3 Logarithmic Functions 243
Recall also from the definition of an inverse function that if f (a)  c , then f 1 (c)  a .
Applying this to the exponential and logarithmic functions:
Logarithm Equivalent to an Exponential
The statement b a  c is equivalent to the statement log b (c)  a .
Alternatively, we could show this by starting with the exponential function c  ba , then
taking the log base b of both sides, giving logb (c)  logb ba . Using the inverse property
of logs we see that logb (c)  a .
Since log is a function, it is most correctly written as log b (c) , using parentheses to
denote function evaluation, just as we would with f(c). However, when the input is a
single variable or number, it is common to see the parentheses dropped and the
expression written as log b c .
Example 1
Write these exponential equations as logarithmic equations:

By establishing the relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions, we can
now solve basic logarithmic and exponential equations by rewriting.
Example 3
Solve log 4 x   2 for x.
By rewriting this expression as an exponential, 4 2  x , so x = 16
Example 4
Solve 2 x  10 for x.
By rewriting this expression as a logarithm, we get x  log 2 (10)
While this does define a solution, and an exact solution at that, you may find it somewhat
unsatisfying since it is difficult to compare this expression to the decimal estimate we
made earlier. Also, giving an exact expression for a solution is not always useful – often
we really need a decimal approximation to the solution. Luckily, this is a task calculators
and computers are quite adept at. Unluckily for us, most calculators and computers will
only evaluate logarithms of two bases. Happily, this ends up not being a problem, as
we’ll see briefly.
Common and Natural Logarithms
The common log is the logarithm with base 10, and is typically written log( x) .
The natural log is the logarithm with base e, and is typically written ln(x) .

Example 5
Evaluate log(1000) using the definition of the
common log.
To evaluate log(1000) , we can say
x  log(1000) , then rewrite into exponential
form using the common log base of 10.
10 x  1000
From this, we might recognize that 1000 is the
cube of 10, so x = 3.
We also can use the inverse property of logs to
write log10 103  3

Example 7
Evaluate log(500) using your calculator or computer.
Using a computer, we can evaluate log( 500)  2.69897

To utilize the common or natural logarithm functions to evaluate expressions like
log 2 (10) , we need to establish some additional properties.
Properties of Logs: Exponent Property
log b Ar   r log b  A
To show why this is true, we offer a proof.
Since the logarithmic and exponential functions are inverses, b logb A  A .

The exponent property allows us to find a method for changing the base of a logarithmic
expression.
Properties of Logs: Change of Base
log c ( A)
log b  A 
log c (b)
Proof:
Let log b  A  x . Rewriting as an exponential gives b x  A . Taking the log base c of
both sides of this equation gives
log c b x  log c A
Now utilizing the exponent property for logs on the left side,
x log c b  log c A
Dividing, we obtain
log c A
log c A
x
or replacing our expression for x, log b A 
log c b
log c b
With this change of base formula, we can finally find a good decimal approximation to
our question from the beginning of the section.
Example 10
Evaluate log 2 (10) using the change of base formula.
According to the change of base formula, we can rewrite the log base 2 as a logarithm
of any other base. Since our calculators can evaluate the natural log, we might choose
to use the natural logarithm, which is the log base e:
log e 10 ln 10
log 2 10 

log e 2

Using our calculators to evaluate this,

Section 4.3 Logarithmic Functions 247

ln 2 0.69315
This finally allows us to answer our original question – the population of flies we
discussed at the beginning of the section will take 3.32 weeks to grow to 500.
Example 11
Evaluate log 5 (100) using the change of base formula.
We can rewrite this expression using any other base. If our calculators are able to
evaluate the common logarithm, we could rewrite using the common log, base 10.

log 5 (100) 

log 10 5

While we were able to solve the basic exponential equation 2 x  10 by rewriting in
logarithmic form and then using the change of base formula to evaluate the logarithm, the
proof of the change of base formula illuminates an alternative approach to solving
exponential equations.
Solving exponential equations:
1. Isolate the exponential expressions when possible
2. Take the logarithm of both sides
3. Utilize the exponent property for logarithms to pull the variable out of the exponent
4. Use algebra to solve for the variable.
Example 12
Solve 2 x  10 for x.
Using this alternative approach, rather than rewrite this exponential into logarithmic
form, we will take the logarithm of both sides of the equation. Since we often wish to
evaluate the result to a decimal answer, we will usually utilize either the common log or
natural log. For this example, we’ll use the natural log:
ln 2 x  ln(10)
Utilizing the exponent property for logs,
x ln 2  ln(10)
Now dividing by ln(2),
ln(10)
x
 2.861
ln  2 

Notice that this result matches the result we found using the change of base formula.

We need to solve for the t so that f(t) = 2
Divide by 1.14 to isolate the exponential expression

4. Solve 5(0.93) x  10 .

In addition to solving exponential equations, logarithmic expressions are common in
many physical situations.
Example 14
In chemistry, pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a liquid. The pH is related to
the concentration of hydrogen ions, [H+], measured in moles per liter, by the equation
pH   log  H   .





If a liquid has concentration of 0.0001 moles per liber, determine the pH.
Determine the hydrogen ion concentration of a liquid with pH of 7.
To answer the first question, we evaluate the expression  log0.0001 . While we could
use our calculators for this, we do not really need them here, since we can use the
inverse property of logs:
 log0.0001   log 10 4  (4)  4





Section 4.3 Logarithmic Functions 249





To answer the second question, we need to solve the equation 7   log  H   . Begin
by isolating the logarithm on one side of the equation by multiplying both sides by -1:
7  log  H  





Rewriting into exponential form yields the answer
 H    107  0.0000001 moles per liter.
Logarithms also provide us a mechanism for finding continuous growth models for
exponential growth given two data points.
Example 15
A population grows from 100 to 130 in 2 weeks. Find the continuous growth rate.
Measuring t in weeks, we are looking for an equation P(t )  ae rt so that P(0) = 100 and
P(2) = 130. Using the first pair of values,
100  aer0 , so a = 100.
Using the second pair of values,
Divide by 100
130  100er2
130
Take the natural log of both sides
 er2
100
Use the inverse property of logs
ln(1.3)  ln e r 2
ln(1.3)  2r
ln(1.3)
r
 0.1312
2
This population is growing at a continuous rate of 13.12% per week.

 

In general, we can relate the standard form of an exponential with the continuous growth
form by noting (using k to represent the continuous growth rate to avoid the confusion of
using r in two different ways in the same formula):
a(1  r ) x  ae kx

(1  r ) x  e kx
1  r  ek
Using this, we see that it is always possible to convert from the continuous growth form
of an exponential to the standard form and vice versa. Remember that the continuous
growth rate k represents the nominal growth rate before accounting for the effects of
continuous compounding, while r represents the actual percent increase in one time unit
(one week, one year, etc.).

250 Chapter 4
Example 16
A company’s sales can be modeled by the function S (t )  5000e 0.12t , with t measured in
years. Find the annual growth rate.
Noting that 1  r  e k , then r  e 0.12  1  0.1275 , so the annual growth rate is 12.75%.
The sales function could also be written in the form S (t )  5000(1  0.1275) t .

It’s just as important to know what properties logarithms do not satisfy as to memorize
the valid properties listed above. In particular, the logarithm is not a linear function,
which means that it does not distribute: log(A + B) ≠ log(A) + log(B).
To help in this process we offer a proof to help solidify our new rules and show how they
follow from properties you’ve already seen.
Let a  log b  A and c  log b C  , so by definition of the logarithm, b a  A and b c  C

log b  AC   log b b a c   a  c
Replacing a and c with their definition establishes the result
log b  AC   log b A  log b C
The proof for the difference property is very similar.
With these properties, we can rewrite expressions involving multiple logs as a single log,
or break an expression involving a single log into expressions involving multiple logs.
Example 1
Write log 3 5  log 3 8  log 3 2 as a single logarithm.
Using the sum of logs property on the first two terms,
log 3 5  log 3 8  log 3 5  8  log 3 40
This reduces our original expression to log 3 40  log 3 2
Then using the difference of logs property,

On the first term, we can use the exponent property of logs to write

With the expression reduced to a sum of two logs, log25  log4 , we can utilize the
sum of logs property
log25  log4  log( 4  25)  log(100)
Since 100 = 102, we can evaluate this log without a calculator:
log(100)  log 10 2  2

 

Then seeing the product in the first term, we use the sum property
ln x 4 y  ln(7)  ln x 4  ln( y)  ln(7)

 

 

Finally, we could use the exponent property on the first term
ln x 4  ln( y)  ln(7)  4 ln( x)  ln( y)  ln(7)

 

Interestingly, solving exponential equations was not the reason
logarithms were originally developed. Historically, up until the
advent of calculators and computers, the power of logarithms was
that these log properties reduced multiplication, division, roots, or
powers to be evaluated using addition, subtraction, division and
multiplication, respectively, which are much easier to compute
without a calculator. Large books were published listing the
logarithms of numbers, such as in the table to the right. To find
the product of two numbers, the sum of log property was used.
Suppose for example we didn’t know the value of 2 times 3.
Using the sum property of logs:

0.9030900
0.9542425
1.0000000

log( 2  3)  log( 2)  log( 3)

Using the log table,
log( 2  3)  log( 2)  log( 3)  0.3010300  0.4771213  0.7781513
We can then use the table again in reverse, looking for 0.7781513 as an output of the
logarithm. From that we can determine:
log( 2  3)  0.7781513  log( 6) .
By doing addition and the table of logs, we were able to determine 2  3  6 .
Likewise, to compute a cube root like 3 8

Although these calculations are simple and insignificant they illustrate the same idea that
was used for hundreds of years as an efficient way to calculate the product, quotient,
roots, and powers of large and complicated numbers, either using tables of logarithms or
mechanical tools called slide rules.
These properties still have other practical applications for interpreting changes in
exponential and logarithmic relationships.
Example 4
Recall that in chemistry, pH   log  H   . If the concentration of hydrogen ions in a
liquid is doubled, what is the affect on pH?





Suppose C is the original concentration of hydrogen ions, and P is the original pH of the
liquid, so P   logC  . If the concentration is doubled, the new concentration is 2C.
Then the pH of the new liquid is
pH   log2C 
Using the sum property of logs,
pH   log2C   log( 2)  log( C )   log( 2)  log( C )
Since P   logC  , the new pH is
pH  P  log( 2)  P  0.301
When the concentration of hydrogen ions is doubled, the pH decreases by 0.301.
Log properties in solving equations
The logarithm properties often arise when solving problems involving logarithms.
Example 5
Solve log( 50 x  25)  log( x)  2 .
In order to rewrite in exponential form, we need a single logarithmic expression on the
left side of the equation. Using the difference property of logs, we can rewrite the left

2. Solve log( x 2  4)  1  log( x  2) .

More complex exponential equations can often be solved in more than one way. In the
following example, we will solve the same problem in two ways – one using logarithm
properties, and the other using exponential properties.
Example 6a
In 2008, the population of Kenya was approximately 38.8 million, and was growing by
2.64% each year, while the population of Sudan was approximately 41.3 million and
growing by 2.24% each year2. If these trends continue, when will the population of
Kenya match that of Sudan?
We start by writing an equation for each population in terms of t, the number of years
after 2008.
Kenya(t )  38.8(1  0.0264)t

Sudan(t )  41.3(1  0.0224)t
To find when the populations will be equal, we can set the equations equal
38.8(1.0264)t  41.3(1.0224)t
For our first approach, we take the log of both sides of the equation
log  38.8(1.0264)t   log  41.3(1.0224)t 
Utilizing the sum property of logs, we can rewrite each side,
log(38.8)  log 1.0264t   log(41.3)  log 1.0224t 
Then utilizing the exponent property, we can pull the variables out of the exponent

In this second table, notice that
1) As the input increases, the output increases.
2) As input increases, the output increases more slowly.
3) Since the exponential function only outputs positive values, the logarithm can
only accept positive values as inputs, so the domain of the log function is (0, ) .
4) Since the exponential function can accept all real numbers as inputs, the logarithm
can output any real number, so the range is all real numbers or (, ) .
Sketching the graph, notice that as the input
approaches zero from the right, the output of
the function grows very large in the negative
direction, indicating a vertical asymptote at
x = 0.
In symbolic notation we write
as x  0  , f ( x)   , and
as x  , f ( x)  

Graphical Features of the Logarithm
Graphically, in the function g ( x)  logb ( x)
The graph has a horizontal intercept at (1, 0)
The graph has a vertical asymptote at x = 0
The graph is increasing and concave down
The domain of the function is x > 0, or (0, )
The range of the function is all real numbers, or (, )
When sketching a general logarithm with base b, it can be helpful to remember that the
graph will pass through the points (1, 0) and (b, 1).

Section 4.5 Graphs of Logarithmic Functions 263
To get a feeling for how the base affects the shape of the graph, examine the graphs
below.

log 2 ( x)
ln( x)
log( x)

Notice that the larger the base, the slower the graph grows. For example, the common
log graph, while it grows without bound, it does so very slowly. For example, to reach an
output of 8, the input must be 100,000,000.
Another important observation made was the domain of the logarithm. Like the
reciprocal and square root functions, the logarithm has a restricted domain which must be
considered when finding the domain of a composition involving a log.
Example 1
Find the domain of the function f ( x)  log( 5  2 x)
The logarithm is only defined with the input is positive, so this function will only be
defined when 5  2 x  0 . Solving this inequality,

inequality, consider how the function has been transformed.

264 Chapter 4
Transformations of the Logarithmic Function
Transformations can be applied to a logarithmic function using the basic transformation
techniques, but as with exponential functions, several transformations result in interesting
relationships.

log c x
1

log c x
log c b log c b
From this, we can see that log b x is a vertical stretch or compression of the graph of the
log c x graph. This tells us that a vertical stretch or compression is equivalent to a change
of base. For this reason, we typically represent all graphs of logarithmic functions in
terms of the common or natural log functions.
First recall the change of base property tells us that log b x 

Next, consider the effect of a horizontal compression on the graph of a logarithmic
function. Considering f ( x)  log( cx) , we can use the sum property to see
f ( x)  log( cx)  log( c)  log( x)
Since log(c) is a constant, the effect of a horizontal compression is the same as the effect
of a vertical shift.
Example 2
Sketch f ( x)  ln( x) and g ( x)  ln( x)  2 .
Graphing these,
g ( x)  ln( x)  2
f ( x)  ln( x)

Note that, this vertical shift could also be written as a horizontal compression:
g ( x)  ln( x)  2  ln( x)  ln(e 2 )  ln(e 2 x) .

While a horizontal stretch or compression can be written as a vertical shift, a horizontal
reflection is unique and separate from vertical shifting.
Finally, we will consider the effect of a horizontal shift on the graph of a logarithm

Section 4.5 Graphs of Logarithmic Functions 265
Example 3
Sketch a graph of f ( x)  ln( x  2) .
This is a horizontal shift to the left by 2 units. Notice that none of our logarithm rules
allow us rewrite this in another form, so the effect of this transformation is unique.
Shifting the graph,

Notice that due to the horizontal shift, the vertical asymptote shifted to x = -2, and the
domain shifted to (2, ) .

Combining these transformations,
Example 4
Sketch a graph of f ( x)  5 log(  x  2) .
Factoring the inside as f ( x)  5 log( ( x  2)) reveals that this graph is that of the
common logarithm, horizontally reflected, vertically stretched by a factor of 5, and
shifted to the right by 2 units.
The vertical asymptote will be shifted to
x = 2, and the graph will have domain
(, 2) . A rough sketch can be created by
using the vertical asymptote along with a
couple points on the graph, such as
f (1)  5 log( 1  2)  5 log(1)  0
f (8)  5 log( (8)  2)  5 log(10)  5

x = b is the vertical asymptote.

It appears the graph passes through the points (–1, 1) and (2, –1). Substituting in (–1, 1),

Section 4.6 Exponential and Logarithmic Models
While we have explored some basic applications of exponential and logarithmic
functions, in this section we explore some important applications in more depth.
Radioactive Decay
In an earlier section, we discussed radioactive decay – the idea that radioactive isotopes
change over time. One of the common terms associated with radioactive decay is halflife.
Half Life
The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half the substance to decay.
Given the basic exponential growth/decay equation h(t )  ab t , half-life can be found by
1
solving for when half the original amount remains; by solving a  a(b) t , or more
2
1
simply  b t . Notice how the initial amount is irrelevant when solving for half-life.
2
Example 1
Bismuth-210 is an isotope that decays by about 13% each day. What is the half-life of
Bismuth-210?
We were not given a starting quantity, so we could either make up a value or use an
unknown constant to represent the starting amount. To show that starting quantity does
not affect the result, let us denote the initial quantity by the constant a. Then the decay
of Bismuth-210 can be described by the equation Q(d )  a(0.87) d .
To find the half-life, we want to determine when the remaining quantity is half the

original: a . Solving,

This tells us that the half-life of Bismuth-210 is approximately 5 days.
Example 2
Cesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years. If you begin with 200mg of cesium-137,
how much will remain after 30 years? 60 years? 90 years?
Since the half-life is 30 years, after 30 years, half the original amount, 100mg, will
remain.
After 60 years, another 30 years have passed, so during that second 30 years, another
half of the substance will decay, leaving 50mg.
After 90 years, another 30 years have passed, so another half of the substance will
decay, leaving 25mg.
Example 3
Cesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years. Find the annual decay rate.
Since we are looking for an annual decay rate, we will use an equation of the form
Q(t )  a(1  r ) t . We know that after 30 years, half the original amount will remain.

Example 4
Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope that is present in organic materials, and is commonly
used for dating historical artifacts. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years. If a bone
fragment is found that contains 20% of its original carbon-14, how old is the bone?
To find how old the bone is, we first will need to find an equation for the decay of the
carbon-14. We could either use a continuous or annual decay formula, but opt to use
the continuous decay formula since it is more common in scientific texts. The half life
tells us that after 5730 years, half the original substance remains. Solving for the rate,

Doubling Time
For decaying quantities, we asked how long it takes for half the substance to decay. For
growing quantities we might ask how long it takes for the quantity to double.
Doubling Time
The doubling time of a growing quantity is the time it takes for the quantity to double.
Given the basic exponential growth equation h(t )  ab t , doubling time can be found by
solving for when the original quantity has doubled; by solving 2a  a(b) x , or more
simply 2  b x . Again notice how the initial amount is irrelevant when solving for
doubling time.
Example 5
Cancer cells sometimes increase exponentially. If a cancerous growth contained 300
cells last month and 360 cells this month, how long will it take for the number of cancer
cells to double?
Defining t to be time in months, with t = 0 corresponding to this month, we are given
two pieces of data: this month, (0, 360), and last month, (-1, 300).
From this data, we can find an equation for the growth. Using the form C (t )  ab t , we
know immediately a = 360, giving C (t )  360b t . Substituting in (-1, 300),

300  360b 1

so when C(t) = 2a.

Example 6
Use of a new social networking website has been growing exponentially, with the
number of new members doubling every 5 months. If the site currently has 120,000
users and this trend continues, how many users will the site have in 1 year?
We can use the doubling time to find a function that models the number of site users,
and then use that equation to answer the question. While we could use an arbitrary a as
we have before for the initial amount, in this case, we know the initial amount was
120,000.
If we use a continuous growth equation, it would look like N (t )  120e rt , measured in
thousands of users after t months. Based on the doubling time, there would be 240
thousand users after 5 months. This allows us to solve for the continuous growth rate:
240  120e r 5
2  er5
ln 2  5r
ln 2
r
 0.1386

Now that we have an equation, N (t )  120e 0.1386t , we can predict the number of users
after 12 months:
N (12)  120e 0.1386(12)  633.140 thousand users.
So after 1 year, we would expect the site to have around 633,140 users.

Newton’s Law of Cooling
When a hot object is left in surrounding air that is at a lower temperature, the object’s
temperature will decrease exponentially, leveling off towards the surrounding air
temperature. This "leveling off" will correspond to a horizontal asymptote in the graph
of the temperature function. Unless the room temperature is zero, this will correspond to
a vertical shift of the generic exponential decay function.

Section 4.6 Exponential and Logarithmic Models 275
Newton’s Law of Cooling
The temperature of an object, T, in surrounding air with temperature Ts will behave
according to the formula
T (t )  ae kt  Ts
Where
t is time
a is a constant determined by the initial temperature of the object
k is a constant, the continuous rate of cooling of the object
While an equation of the form T (t )  ab t  Ts could be used, the continuous growth form
is more common.
Example 7
A cheesecake is taken out of the oven with an ideal internal temperature of 165 degrees
Fahrenheit, and is placed into a 35 degree refrigerator. After 10 minutes, the
cheesecake has cooled to 150 degrees. If you must wait until the cheesecake has cooled
to 70 degrees before you eat it, how long will you have to wait?
Since the surrounding air temperature in the refrigerator is 35 degrees, the cheesecake’s
temperature will decay exponentially towards 35, following the equation
T (t )  ae kt  35
We know the initial temperature was 165, so T (0)  165 . Substituting in these values,
165  ae k 0  35
165  a  35

We were given another pair of data, T (10)  150 , which we can use to solve for k

Notice that on the log scale above Example 8, the visual distance on the scale between
points A and B and between C and D is the same. When looking at the values these
points correspond to, notice B is ten times the value of A, and D is ten times the value of
C. A visual linear difference between points corresponds to a relative (ratio) change
between the corresponding values.
Logarithms are useful for showing these relative changes. For example, comparing
$1,000,000 to $10,000, the first is 100 times larger than the second.
1,000,000
 100  10 2
10,000
Likewise, comparing $1000 to $10, the first is 100 times larger than the second.

When one quantity is roughly ten times larger than another, we say it is one order of
magnitude larger. In both cases described above, the first number was two orders of
magnitude larger than the second.

An example of a logarithmic scale is the Moment Magnitude Scale (MMS) used for
earthquakes. This scale is commonly and mistakenly called the Richter Scale, which was
a very similar scale succeeded by the MMS.

If one earthquake has a MMS magnitude of 6.0, and another has a magnitude of 8.0,
how much more powerful (in terms of earth movement) is the second earthquake?
Since the first earthquake has magnitude 6.0, we can find the amount of earth
movement. The value of S0 is not particularly relevant, so we will not replace it with its
value.

Section 4.7 Fitting Exponential Models to Data 289

Section 4.7 Fitting Exponential Models to Data
In the previous section, we saw number lines using logarithmic scales. It is also common
to see two dimensional graphs with one or both axes using a logarithmic scale.
One common use of a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis is to graph quantities that are
changing exponentially, since it helps reveal relative differences. This is commonly used
in stock charts, since values historically have grown exponentially over time. Both stock
charts below show the Dow Jones Industrial Average, from 1928 to 2010.

Both charts have a linear horizontal scale, but the first graph has a linear vertical scale,
while the second has a logarithmic vertical scale. The first scale is the one we are more
familiar with, and shows what appears to be a strong exponential trend, at least up until
the year 2000.

290 Chapter 4
Example 1
There were stock market drops in 1929 and 2008. Which was larger?
In the first graph, the stock market drop around 2008 looks very large, and in terms of
dollar values, it was indeed a large drop. However the second graph shows relative
changes, and the drop in 2009 seems less major on this graph, and in fact the drop
starting in 1929 was, percentage-wise, much more significant.
Specifically, in 2008, the Dow value dropped from about 14,000 to 8,000, a drop of
6,000. This is obviously a large value drop, and amounts to about a 43% drop. In 1929,
the Dow value dropped from a high of around 380 to a low of 42 by July of 1932.
While value-wise this drop of 338 is much smaller than the 2008 drop, it corresponds to
a 89% drop, a much larger relative drop than in 2008. The logarithmic scale shows
these relative changes.
The second graph above, in which one axis uses a linear scale and the other axis uses a
logarithmic scale, is an example of a semi-log graph.
Semi-log and Log-log Graphs
A semi-log graph is a graph with one axis using a linear scale and one axis using a
logarithmic scale.
A log-log graph is a graph with both axes using logarithmic scales.
Example 2
Plot 5 points on the graph of f ( x)  3(2) x on a semi-log graph with a logarithmic scale
on the vertical axis.
To do this, we need to find 5 points on the graph, then calculate the logarithm of the
output value. Arbitrarily choosing 5 input values,

Notice that on this semi-log scale, values from the exponential function appear linear.

This relationship is linear, with log(a) as the vertical intercept, and log(b) as the slope.
This relationship can also be utilized in reverse.

Fitting Exponential Functions to Data
Some technology options provide dedicated functions for finding exponential functions
that fit data, but many only provide functions for fitting linear functions to data. The
semi-log scale provides us with a method to fit an exponential function to data by
building upon the techniques we have for fitting linear functions to data.
To fit an exponential function to a set of data using linearization
1. Find the log of the data output values
2. Find the linear equation that fits the (input, log(output)) pairs. This equation will be
of the form log(f(x)) = b + mx
3. Solve this equation for the exponential function f(x)

As expected, the graph of the log of costs appears fairly linear, suggesting an
exponential function will fit the original data will fit reasonably well. Using
technology, we can find a linear equation to fit the log(Cost) values. Using t as years
after 1980, linear regression gives the equation:
log( C (t ))  2.794  0.231t
Solving for C(t),
C (t )  10 2.7940.231t
C (t )  10 2.794  10 0.231t

C (t )  10 2.794  10 0.231

This equation suggests that the cost per megabyte for storage on computer hard drives is
decreasing by about 41% each year.

Using this function, we could predict the cost of storage in the future. Predicting the
cost in the year 2020 (t = 40):
40
C (40)  622  0.5877  0.000000364 dollars per megabyte, a really small number.
That is equivalent to $0.36 per terabyte of hard drive storage.
Comparing the values predicted by this model to the actual data, we see the model
matches the original data in order of magnitude, but the specific values appear quite
different. This is, unfortunately, the best exponential model that can fit the data. It is
possible that a non-exponential model would fit the data better, or there could just be
wide enough variability in the data that no relatively simple model would fit the data
any better.

In the previous chapters we have explored a variety of functions which could be
combined to form a variety of shapes. In this discussion, one common shape has been
missing: the circle. We already know certain things about the circle, like how to find area
and circumference, and the relationship between radius and diameter, but now, in this
chapter, we explore the circle and its unique features that lead us into the rich world of
trigonometry.

Section 5.1 Circles
To begin, we need to remember how to find distances. Starting with the Pythagorean
Theorem, which relates the sides of a right triangle, we can find the distance between two
points.
Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of the squares of the legs of a right
triangle will equal the square of the hypotenuse of the triangle.
In graphical form, given the triangle shown, a 2  b2  c2 .

c

a
b

We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between two points on a graph.
Example 1
Find the distance between the points (-3, 2) and (2, 5).
By plotting these points on the plane, we can then
draw a right triangle with these points at each end
of the hypotenuse. We can calculate horizontal
width of the triangle to be 5 and the vertical height
to be 3. From these we can find the distance
between the points using the Pythagorean
Theorem:

dist 2  5 2  3 2  34
dist  34

298 Chapter 5
Notice that the width of the triangle was calculated using the difference between the x
(input) values of the two points, and the height of the triangle was found using the
difference between the y (output) values of the two points. Generalizing this process
gives us the general distance formula.
Distance Formula
The distance between two points ( x1 , y1 ) and ( x2 , y 2 ) can be calculated as
dist  ( x2  x1 ) 2  ( y 2  y1 ) 2

Try it Now
1. Find the distance between the points (1, 6) and (3, -5).
Circles
If we wanted to find an equation to represent a circle with
a radius of r centered at a point (h, k), we notice that the
distance between any point (x, y) on the circle and the
center point is always the same: r. Noting this, we can
use our distance formula to write an equation for the
radius:

(x, y)
r
(h, k)

r  ( x  h) 2  ( y  k ) 2

Squaring both sides of the equation gives us the standard equation for a circle.
Equation of a Circle
The equation of a circle centered at the point (h, k) with radius r can be written as
( x  h) 2  ( y  k ) 2  r 2

Notice that a circle does not pass the vertical line test. It is not possible to write y as a
function of x or vice versa.
Example 2
Write an equation for a circle centered at the point (-3, 2) with radius 4.
Using the equation from above, h = -3, k = 2, and the radius r = 4. Using these in our
formula,
( x  (3)) 2  ( y  2) 2  4 2
simplified a bit, this gives

( x  3)  ( y  2)  16

Section 5.1 Circles 299
Example 3
Write an equation for the circle graphed here.
This circle is centered at the origin, the point (0, 0). By
measuring horizontally or vertically from the center out to
the circle, we can see the radius is 3. Using this information
in our formula gives:
simplified a bit, this gives
( x  0) 2  ( y  0) 2  32

x2  y2  9

2. Write an equation for a circle centered at (4, -2) with radius 6.
Notice that, relative to a circle centered at the origin, horizontal and vertical shifts of the
circle are revealed in the values of h and k, which are the coordinates for the center of the
circle.
Points on a Circle
As noted earlier, an equation for a circle cannot be written so that y is a function of x or
vice versa. To find coordinates on the circle given only the x or y value, we must solve
algebraically for the unknown values.
Example 4
Find the points on a circle of radius 5 centered at the origin with an x value of 3.
We begin by writing an equation for the circle centered at the origin with a radius of 5.
x 2  y 2  25
Substituting in the desired x value of 3 gives an equation we can solve for y
3 2  y 2  25

y 2  25  9  16
y   16  4
There are two points on the circle with an x value of 3: (3, 4) and (3, -4).

300 Chapter 5
Example 5
Find the x intercepts of a circle with radius 6 centered at the point (2, 4).
We can start by writing an equation for the circle.
( x  2) 2  ( y  4) 2  36
To find the x intercepts, we need to find the points where y = 0. Substituting in zero for
y, we can solve for x.
( x  2) 2  (0  4) 2  36
( x  2) 2  16  36

Example 6
In a town, Main Street runs east to west, and Meridian Road runs north to south. A
pizza store is located on Meridian 2 miles south of the intersection of Main and
Meridian. If the store advertises that it delivers within a 3 mile radius, how much of
Main Street do they deliver to?
This type of question is one in which introducing a coordinate system and drawing a
picture can help us solve the problem. We could either place the origin at the
intersection of the two streets, or place the origin at the pizza store itself. It is often
easier to work with circles centered at the origin, so we’ll place the origin at the pizza
store, though either approach would work fine.
Placing the origin at the pizza store, the delivery area
with radius 3 miles can be described as the region inside
the circle described by x 2  y 2  9 . Main Street,
located 2 miles north of the pizza store and running east
to west, can be described by the equation y = 2.
To find the portion of Main Street the store will deliver
to, we first find the boundary of their delivery region by
looking for where the delivery circle intersects Main
Street. To find the intersection, we look for the points
on the circle where y = 2. Substituting y = 2 into the
circle equation lets us solve for the corresponding x values.

Section 5.1 Circles 301

x 2  22  9
x2  9  4  5
x   5  2.236
This means the pizza store will deliver 2.236 miles down Main Street east of Meridian
and 2.236 miles down Main Street west of Meridian. We can conclude that the pizza
store delivers to a 4.472 mile segment of Main St.
In addition to finding where a vertical or horizontal line intersects the circle, we can also
find where an arbitrary line intersects a circle.
Example 7
Find where the line f ( x)  4 x intersects the circle ( x  2) 2  y 2  16 .
Normally, to find an intersection of two functions f(x) and g(x) we would solve for the x
value that would make the function equal by solving the equation f(x) = g(x). In the
case of a circle, it isn’t possible to represent the equation as a function, but we can
utilize the same idea. The output value of the line determines the y value:
y  f ( x)  4 x . We want the y value of the circle to equal the y value of the line, which
is the output value of the function. To do this, we can substitute the expression for y
from the line into the circle equation.

( x  2) 2  y 2  16
( x  2) 2  (4 x) 2  16
x 2  4 x  4  16 x 2  16
17 x 2  4 x  4  16
17 x 2  4 x  12  0

we replace y with the line formula: y  4 x
expand
and simplify
since this equation is quadratic, we arrange one side to be 0

Since this quadratic doesn’t appear to be easily factorable, we can use the quadratic
formula to solve for x:

 (4)  (4) 2  4(17)(12) 4  832
x

, or approximately x ≈ 0.966 or -0.731
2(17)
34
From these x values we can use either equation to find the corresponding y values.
Since the line equation is easier to evaluate, we might choose to use it:
y  f (0.966)  4(0.966)  3.864
y  f (0.731)  4(0.731)  2.923
The line intersects the circle at the points (0.966, 3.864) and (-0.731, -2.923).

Section 5.2 Angles 307

Section 5.2 Angles
Because many applications involving circles also involve a rotation of the circle, it is
natural to introduce a measure for the rotation, or angle, between two rays (line segments)
emanating from the center of a circle. The angle measurement you are most likely
familiar with is degrees, so we’ll begin there.
Measure of an Angle
The measure of an angle is a measurement between two
intersecting lines, line segments or rays, starting at the initial side
and ending at the terminal side. It is a rotational measure not a
linear measure.

terminal side
angle
initial side

Measuring Angles
Degrees
A degree is a measurement of angle. One full rotation around the circle is equal to 360
degrees, so one degree is 1/360 of a circle.
An angle measured in degrees should always include the unit “degrees” after the
number, or include the degree symbol °. For example, 90 degrees = 90 .
Standard Position
When measuring angles on a circle, unless otherwise directed, we measure angles in
standard position: starting at the positive horizontal axis and with counter-clockwise
rotation.
Example 1
Give the degree measure of the angle shown on the circle.
The vertical and horizontal lines divide the circle into quarters.
Since one full rotation is 360 degrees= 360 , each quarter rotation
is 360/4 = 90 or 90 degrees.
Example 2
Show an angle of 30 on the circle.
An angle of 30 is 1/3 of 90 , so by dividing a quarter rotation into
thirds, we can sketch a line at 30 .

Working with Angles in Degrees
Notice that since there are 360 degrees in one rotation, an
angle greater than 360 degrees would indicate more than 1
full rotation. Shown on a circle, the resulting direction in
which this angle’s terminal side points would be the same as
for another angle between 0 and 360 degrees. These angles
would be called coterminal.
Coterminal Angles
After completing their full rotation based on the given angle, two angles are coterminal
if they terminate in the same position, so their terminal sides coincide (point in the same
direction).
Example 3
Find an angle θ that is coterminal with 800 , where 0    360
Since adding or subtracting a full rotation, 360 degrees, would result in an angle with
terminal side pointing in the same direction, we can find coterminal angles by adding or
subtracting 360 degrees. An angle of 800 degrees is coterminal with an angle of 800360 = 440 degrees. It would also be coterminal with an angle of 440-360 = 80 degrees.
The angle   80 is coterminal with 800 .
By finding the coterminal angle between 0 and 360 degrees, it can be easier to see
which direction the terminal side of an angle points in.
Try it Now
1. Find an angle  that is coterminal with 870 , where 0    360 .
On a number line a positive number is measured to the right and a negative number is
measured in the opposite direction (to the left). Similarly a positive angle is measured
counterclockwise and a negative angle is measured in the opposite direction (clockwise).

Section 5.2 Angles 309
Example 4
Show the angle  45 on the circle and find a positive angle  that is coterminal and
0    360 .
Since 45 degrees is half of 90 degrees, we can start at the
positive horizontal axis and measure clockwise half of a 90
degree angle.

315°
-45°

Since we can find coterminal angles by adding or subtracting a

angle here by adding 360 degrees:

Angles in Radians
While measuring angles in degrees may be familiar, doing so often complicates matters
since the units of measure can get in the way of calculations. For this reason, another
measure of angles is commonly used. This measure is based on the distance around a
circle.
Arclength
Arclength is the length of an arc, s, along a circle of radius r
subtended (drawn out) by an angle  . It is the portion of the
circumference between the initial and terminal sides of the angle.

s

r
θ

310 Chapter 5
The length of the arc around an entire circle is called the circumference of a circle. The
circumference of a circle is C  2r . The ratio of the circumference to the radius,
produces the constant 2 . Regardless of the radius, this ratio is always the same, just as
how the degree measure of an angle is independent of the radius.
To elaborate on this idea, consider two circles, one with radius 2 and one with radius 3.
Recall the circumference (perimeter) of a circle is C  2r , where r is the radius of the
circle. The smaller circle then has circumference 2 (2)  4 and the larger has
circumference 2 (3)  6 .
Drawing a 45 degree angle on the two circles, we might be
interested in the length of the arc of the circle that the angle
indicates. In both cases, the 45 degree angle draws out an arc that
is 1/8th of the full circumference, so for the smaller circle, the
1

arclength = (4 )   , and for the larger circle, the length of the

arc or arclength

= (6 )   .

Notice what happens if we find the ratio of the arclength divided by the radius of the
circle:

Larger circle: 4  

The ratio is the same regardless of the radius of the circle – it only depends on the angle.
This property allows us to define a measure of the angle based on arclength.

Radians
The radian measure of an angle is the ratio of the length of the circular arc subtended
by the angle to the radius of the circle.
In other words, if s is the length of an arc of a circle, and r is the radius of the circle,
then
s
radian measure 
r
If the circle has radius 1, then the radian measure corresponds to the length of the arc.

Section 5.2 Angles 311

Because radian measure is the ratio of two lengths, it is a unitless measure. It is not
necessary to write the label “radians” after a radian measure, and if you see an angle that
is not labeled with “degrees” or the degree symbol, you should assume that it is a radian
measure.
Considering the most basic case, the unit circle (a circle with radius 1), we know that 1
rotation equals 360 degrees, 360 . We can also track one rotation around a circle by
finding the circumference, C  2r , and for the unit circle C  2 . These two different
ways to rotate around a circle give us a way to convert from degrees to radians.
1 rotation = 360 = 2 radians
½ rotation = 180 =  radians
¼ rotation = 90 =  / 2 radians
Example 5
Find the radian measure of one third of a full rotation.
For any circle, the arclength along such a rotation would be one third of the

Arclength and Area of a Sector
Recall that the radian measure of an angle was defined as the ratio of the arclength of a
s
circular arc to the radius of the circle,   . From this relationship, we can find
r
arclength along a circle given an angle.
Arclength on a Circle
The length of an arc, s, along a circle of radius r subtended by angle  in radians is
s  r
Example 9
Mercury orbits the sun at a distance of approximately 36 million miles. In one Earth
day, it completes 0.0114 rotation around the sun. If the orbit was perfectly circular,
what distance through space would Mercury travel in one Earth day?
To begin, we will need to convert the decimal rotation value to a radian measure. Since
one rotation = 2 radians,
0.0114 rotation = 2 (0.0114)  0.0716 radians.

314 Chapter 5
Combining this with the given radius of 36 million miles, we can find the arclength:
s  (36)(0.0716)  2.578 million miles travelled through space.

pizza or pie.
Recall that the area of a circle with radius r can be found using the formula A   r 2 . If a

Linear and Angular Velocity
When your car drives down a road, it makes sense to describe its speed in terms of miles
per hour or meters per second. These are measures of speed along a line, also called
linear velocity. When a point on a circle rotates, we would describe its angular velocity,
or rotational speed, in radians per second, rotations per minute, or degrees per hour.
Angular and Linear Velocity
As a point moves along a circle of radius r, its angular velocity,  , can be found as the
angular rotation  per unit time, t.



The linear velocity, v, of the point can be found as the distance travelled, arclength s,
per unit time, t.

angular velocity in radians per second.3
The wheel completes 1 rotation = 2 radians in 5 seconds, so the

angular velocity would be  

Combining the definitions above with the arclength equation, s  r , we can find a
relationship between angular and linear velocities. The angular velocity equation can be
solved for  , giving   t . Substituting this into the arclength equation gives
s  r  rt .

Section 5.3 Points on Circles Using Sine and Cosine 321

Section 5.3 Points on Circles Using Sine and Cosine
While it is convenient to describe the location of a point on a circle using an angle or a
distance along the circle, relating this information to the x and y coordinates and the circle
equation we explored in Section 5.1 is an important application of trigonometry.
A distress signal is sent from a sailboat during a storm, but the transmission is unclear
and the rescue boat sitting at the marina cannot determine the sailboat’s location. Using
high powered radar, they determine the distress signal is coming from a distance of 20
miles at an angle of 225 degrees from the marina. How many miles east/west and
north/south of the rescue boat is the stranded sailboat?
In a general sense, to investigate this, we begin by
drawing a circle centered at the origin with radius r,
and marking the point on the circle indicated by some
angle θ. This point has coordinates (x, y).

(x, y)
r
θ

If we drop a line segment vertically down from this
point to the x axis, we would form a right triangle
inside of the circle.
No matter which quadrant our angle θ puts us in we
can draw a triangle by dropping a perpendicular line
segment to the x axis, keeping in mind that the values
of x and y may be positive or negative, depending on the quadrant.

Additionally, if the angle θ puts us on an axis, we simply measure the radius as the x or y
with the other value being 0, again ensuring we have appropriate signs on the coordinates
based on the quadrant.
Triangles obtained from different radii will all be similar triangles, meaning
corresponding sides scale proportionally. While the lengths of the sides may change, the
ratios of the side lengths will always remain constant for any given angle.
To be able to refer to these ratios more easily, we will give them names. Since the ratios
depend on the angle, we will write them as functions of the angle  .
Sine and Cosine
For the point (x, y) on a circle of radius r at an angle of  , we
can define two important functions as the ratios of the sides of
the corresponding triangle:
y
The sine function: sin( ) 
r
x
The cosine function: cos( ) 
r

(x, y)

322 Chapter 5
In this chapter, we will explore these functions using both circles and right triangles. In
the next chapter we will take a closer look at the behavior and characteristics of the sine
and cosine functions.
Example 1
The point (3, 4) is on the circle of radius 5 at some angle θ. Find cos( ) and sin( ) .
Knowing the radius of the circle and coordinates of the point, we can evaluate the
cosine and sine functions as the ratio of the sides.
x 3
y 4
cos( )  
sin( )  

There are a few cosine and sine values which we can determine fairly easily because the
corresponding point on the circle falls on the x or y axis.
Example 2
Find cos(90) and sin(90)
On any circle, the terminal side of a 90 degree angle
points straight up, so the coordinates of the
corresponding point on the circle would be (0, r).
Using our definitions of cosine and sine,

Coordinates of the Point on a Circle at a Given Angle
On a circle of radius r at an angle of  , we can find the coordinates of the point (x, y)
at that angle using
x  r cos( )
y  r sin( )
On a unit circle, a circle with radius 1, x  cos( ) and y  sin( ) .

cos 2 ( )  sin 2 ( )  1
Here cos 2 ( ) is a commonly used shorthand notation for (cos( )) 2 . Be aware that many
calculators and computers do not understand the shorthand notation.
In Section 5.1 we related the Pythagorean Theorem a 2  b 2  c 2 to the basic equation of
a circle x 2  y 2  r 2 , which we have now used to arrive at the Pythagorean Identity.
Pythagorean Identity
The Pythagorean Identity. For any angle θ, cos 2 ( )  sin 2 ( )  1.
One use of this identity is that it helps us to find a cosine value of an angle if we know
the sine value of that angle or vice versa. However, since the equation will yield two
possible values, we will need to utilize additional knowledge of the angle to help us find
the desired value.

If sin( ) 

For any given angle in the first quadrant, there will be an angle in another quadrant with
the same sine value, and yet another angle in yet another quadrant with the same cosine
value. Since the sine value is the y coordinate on the unit circle, the other angle with the
same sine will share the same y value, but have the opposite x value. Likewise, the angle
with the same cosine will share the same x value, but have the opposite y value.
As shown here, angle α has the same sine value as angle θ; the cosine values would be
opposites. The angle β has the same cosine value as the angle θ; the sine values would be
opposites.

It is important to notice the relationship between the angles. If, from the angle, you

An angle’s reference angle is the size of the
smallest angle to the horizontal axis.
A reference angle is always an angle between 0

Angles share the same cosine and sine values as
their reference angles, except for signs (positive or

Find the reference angle of 150 degrees. Use it to find cos(150) and sin(150) .
150 degrees is located in the second quadrant. It is 30 degrees short of the horizontal
axis at 180 degrees, so the reference angle is 30 degrees.
This tells us that 150 degrees has the same sine and cosine values as 30 degrees, except
3

for sign. We know that sin(30)  and cos(30) 
. Since 150 degrees is in the

second quadrant, the x coordinate of the point on the circle would be negative, so the
cosine value will be negative. The y coordinate is positive, so the sine value will be

The special values of sine and cosine in the first quadrant are very useful to know, since
knowing them allows you to quickly evaluate the sine and cosine of very common angles
without needing to look at a reference or use your calculator. However, scenarios do
come up where we need to know the sine and cosine of other angles.
To find the cosine and sine of any other angle, we turn to a computer or calculator. Be
aware: most calculators can be set into “degree” or “radian” mode, which tells the
calculator the units for the input value. When you evaluate “cos(30)” on your calculator,
it will evaluate it as the cosine of 30 degrees if the calculator is in degree mode, or the
cosine of 30 radians if the calculator is in radian mode. Most computer software with
cosine and sine functions only operates in radian mode.
Example 8
Evaluate the cosine of 20 degrees using a calculator or computer.
On a calculator that can be put in degree mode, you can evaluate this directly to be
approximately 0.939693.
On a computer or calculator without degree mode, you would first need to convert the

Section 5.4 The Other Trigonometric Functions 333

Section 5.4 The Other Trigonometric Functions
In the previous section, we defined the sine and cosine functions as ratios of the sides of a
right triangle in a circle. Since the triangle has 3 sides there are 6 possible combinations
of ratios. While the sine and cosine are the two prominent ratios that can be formed,
there are four others, and together they define the 6 trigonometric functions.
Tangent, Secant, Cosecant, and Cotangent Functions
For the point (x, y) on a circle of radius r at an angle of  , we
can define four additional important functions as the ratios of the
sides of the corresponding triangle:
y
The tangent function: tan( ) 
x
r
The secant function: sec( ) 
x
r
The cosecant function: csc( ) 
y
x
The cotangent function: cot( ) 
y

(x, y)
r

y

θ
x

Geometrically, notice that the definition of tangent corresponds with the slope of the line
segment between the origin (0, 0) and the point (x, y). This relationship can be very
helpful in thinking about tangent values.
You may also notice that the ratios defining the secant, cosecant, and cotangent are the
reciprocals of the ratios defining the cosine, sine, and tangent functions, respectively.
Additionally, notice that using our results from the last section,
y r sin( ) sin( )
tan( )  

x r cos( ) cos( )
Applying this concept to the other trig functions we can state the other reciprocal
identities.
Identities
The other four trigonometric functions can be related back to the sine and cosine
functions using these basic relationships:

tan( ) 

sin( )
cos( )

sec( ) 

1
cos( )

csc( ) 

1
sin( )

cot( ) 

1
cos( )

tan( ) sin( )

334 Chapter 5
These relationships are called identities. Identities are statements that are true for all
values of the input on which they are defined. Identities are usually something that can
be derived from definitions and relationships we already know, similar to how the
identities above were derived from the circle relationships of the six trig functions. The
Pythagorean Identity we learned earlier was derived from the Pythagorean Theorem and
the definitions of sine and cosine. We will discuss the role of identities more after an
example.

Since we know the sine and cosine values for these angles, it makes sense to relate the
tangent and secant values back to the sine and cosine values.

Notice this result is consistent with our interpretation of the tangent value as the slope

indeed have a slope of 1.

Occasionally a question may ask you to “prove the identity” or “establish the identity.”
This is the same idea as when an algebra book asks a question like “show that
( x  1) 2  x 2  2 x  1 .” In this type of question we must show the algebraic
manipulations that demonstrate that the left and right side of the equation are in fact
equal. You can think of a “prove the identity” problem as a simplification problem where
you know the answer: you know what the end goal of the simplification should be, and
just need to show the steps to get there.
To prove an identity, in most cases you will start with the expression on one side of the
identity and manipulate it using algebra and trigonometric identities until you have
simplified it to the expression on the other side of the equation. Do not treat the identity
like an equation to solve – it isn’t! The proof is establishing if the two expressions are
equal, so we must take care to work with one side at a time rather than applying
an operation simultaneously to both sides of the equation.
Example 3
Prove the identity

1  cot( )
 sin( )  cos( ) .
csc( )

Since the left side seems a bit more complicated, we will start there and simplify the
expression until we obtain the right side. We can use the right side as a guide for what
might be good steps to make. In this case, the left side involves a fraction while the
right side doesn’t, which suggests we should look to see if the fraction can be reduced.

336 Chapter 5
Additionally, since the right side involves sine and cosine and the left does not, it
suggests that rewriting the cotangent and cosecant using sine and cosine might be a
good idea.

We can also utilize identities we have previously learned, like the Pythagorean Identity,
while simplifying or proving identities.
Example 4
Establish the identity

cos 2  
 1  sin   .
1  sin  

Since the left side of the identity is more complicated, it makes sense to start there. To
simplify this, we will have to reduce the fraction, which would require the numerator to
have a factor in common with the denominator. Additionally, we notice that the right
side only involves sine. Both of these suggest that we need to convert the cosine into
something involving sine.
Recall the Pythagorean Identity told us cos 2 ( )  sin 2 ( )  1. By moving one of the
trig functions to the other side, we can establish:

sin 2 ( )  1  cos 2 ( )

and

cos 2 ( )  1  sin 2 ( )

Utilizing this, we now can establish the identity. We start on one side and manipulate:

Section 5.5 Right Triangle Trigonometry
In section 5.3 we were introduced to the sine and cosine function as ratios of the sides of
a triangle drawn inside a circle, and spent the rest of that section discussing the role of
those functions in finding points on the circle. In this section, we return to the triangle,
and explore the applications of the trigonometric functions to right triangles where circles
may not be involved.
Recall that we defined sine and cosine as

Separating the triangle from the circle, we can make equivalent but more general
definitions of the sine, cosine, and tangent on a right triangle. On the right triangle, we
will label the hypotenuse as well as the side opposite the angle and the side adjacent (next
to) the angle.
Right Triangle Relationships
Given a right triangle with an angle of 

A common mnemonic for remembering these relationships is SohCahToa, formed from
the first letters of “Sine is opposite over hypotenuse, Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,
Tangent is opposite over adjacent.”
Example 1
Given the triangle shown, find the value for cos( ) .

You may have noticed that in the above example that cos( )  sin(  ) and
cos( )  sin( ) . This makes sense since the side opposite α is also adjacent to β. Since
the three angles in a triangle need to add to π, or 180 degrees, then the other two angles

height of the tree.
We can introduce a variable, h, to represent the height

important to us are the side opposite the angle, the
height of the tree we are looking for, and the adjacent
side, the side we are told is 30 feet long.

few blocks away, wondering how tall it is. She measures the angle of declination from
the roof of the building to the base of the skyscraper to be 20 degrees and the angle of
inclination to the top of the skyscraper to be 42 degrees.
To approach this problem, it would be
good to start with a picture. Although
we are interested in the height, h, of the

Chapter 6: Periodic Functions
In the previous chapter, the trigonometric functions were introduced as ratios of sides of a
right triangle, and related to points on a circle. We noticed how the x and y values of the
points did not change with repeated revolutions around the circle by finding coterminal
angles. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at the important characteristics and
applications of these types of functions, and begin solving equations involving them.

Section 6.1 Sinusoidal Graphs
The London Eye1 is a huge Ferris wheel with diameter
135 meters (443 feet) in London, England, which
completes one rotation every 30 minutes. When we
look at the behavior of this Ferris wheel it is clear that it
completes 1 cycle, or 1 revolution, and then repeats this
revolution over and over again.
This is an example of a periodic function, because the
Ferris wheel repeats its revolution or one cycle every 30
minutes, and so we say it has a period of 30 minutes.
In this section, we will work to sketch a graph of a
rider’s height above the ground over time and express
this height as a function of time.
Periodic Functions
A periodic function is a function for which a specific horizontal shift, P, results in the
original function: f ( x  P)  f ( x) for all values of x. When this occurs we call the
smallest such horizontal shift with P > 0 the period of the function.
You might immediately guess that there is a connection here to finding points on a circle,
since the height above ground would correspond to the y value of a point on the circle.
We can determine the y value by using the sine function. To get a better sense of this
function’s behavior, we can create a table of values we know, and use them to sketch a
graph of the sine and cosine functions.

Notice how the sine values are positive between 0 and π, which correspond to the values
of sine in quadrants 1 and 2 on the unit circle, and the sine values are negative between π
and 2π, corresponding to quadrants 3 and 4.

Section 6.1 Sinusoidal Graphs 355
g(θ) = cos(θ)

θ

Like the sine function we can track the value of the cosine function through the 4
quadrants of the unit circle as we place it on a graph.
Both of these functions are defined for all real numbers, since we can evaluate the sine
and cosine of any angle. By thinking of sine and cosine as coordinates of points on a unit
circle, it becomes clear that the range of both functions must be the interval [1, 1] .

Domain and Range of Sine and Cosine
The domain of sine and cosine is all real numbers, (, ) .
The range of sine and cosine is the interval [-1, 1].
Both these graphs are called sinusoidal graphs.
In both graphs, the shape of the graph begins repeating after 2π. Indeed, since any
coterminal angles will have the same sine and cosine values, we could conclude that
sin(  2 )  sin( ) and cos(  2 )  cos( ) .
In other words, if you were to shift either graph horizontally by 2π, the resulting shape
would be identical to the original function. Sinusoidal functions are a specific type of
periodic function.
Period of Sine and Cosine
The periods of the sine and cosine functions are both 2π.
Looking at these functions on a domain centered at the vertical axis helps reveal
symmetries.

356 Chapter 6
sine

cosine

The sine function is symmetric about the origin, the same symmetry the cubic function
has, making it an odd function. The cosine function is clearly symmetric about the y axis,
the same symmetry as the quadratic function, making it an even function.
Negative Angle Identities
The sine is an odd function, symmetric about the origin, so sin( )   sin( ) .
The cosine is an even function, symmetric about the y-axis, so cos( )  cos( ) .
These identities can be used, among other purposes, for helping with simplification and
proving identities.


You may recall the cofunction identity from last chapter; sin( )  cos    .

Graphically, this tells us that the sine and cosine graphs are horizontal transformations of
each other. We can prove this by using the cofunction identity and the negative angle
identity for cosine.

Now we can clearly see that if we horizontally shift the cosine function to the right by π/2
we get the sine function.
Remember this shift is not representing the period of the function. It only shows that the

Example 2
A point rotates around a circle of radius 3.
Sketch a graph of the y coordinate of the
point.
Recall that for a point on a circle of radius r,
the y coordinate of the point is y  r sin( ) ,
so in this case, we get the
equation y( )  3 sin( ) .
The constant 3 causes a vertical stretch of the y values of the function by a factor of 3.
Notice that the period of the function does not change.
Since the outputs of the graph will now oscillate between -3 and 3, we say that the
amplitude of the sine wave is 3.

Example 3
A circle with radius 3 feet is mounted with its center 4
feet off the ground. The point closest to the ground is
labeled P. Sketch a graph of the height above ground of
the point P as the circle is rotated, then find a function
that gives the height in terms of the angle of rotation.

358 Chapter 6
Sketching the height, we note that it will
start 1 foot above the ground, then increase
up to 7 feet above the ground, and continue
to oscillate 3 feet above and below the
center value of 4 feet.
Although we could use a transformation of
either the sine or cosine function, we start by
looking for characteristics that would make
one function easier to use than the other.
We decide to use a cosine function because it starts at the highest or lowest value, while
a sine function starts at the middle value. A standard cosine starts at the highest value,
and this graph starts at the lowest value, so we need to incorporate a vertical reflection.
Second, we see that the graph oscillates 3 above and below the center, while a basic
cosine has an amplitude of one, so this graph has been vertically stretched by 3, as in
the last example.
Finally, to move the center of the circle up to a height of 4, the graph has been vertically
shifted up by 4. Putting these transformations together,
h( )  3 cos( )  4

Midline
The center value of a sinusoidal function, the value that the function oscillates above
and below, is called the midline of the function, corresponding to a vertical shift.
The function f ( )  cos( )  k has midline at y = k.
Try it Now
2. What is the midline of the function f ( )  3 cos( )  4 ? Sketch a graph of the
function.
To answer the Ferris wheel problem at the beginning of the section, we need to be able to
express our sine and cosine functions at inputs of time. To do so, we will utilize
composition. Since the sine function takes an input of an angle, we will look for a
function that takes time as an input and outputs an angle. If we can find a suitable
 (t ) function, then we can compose this with our f ( )  cos( ) function to obtain a
sinusoidal function of time: f (t )  cos( (t )) .

Section 6.1 Sinusoidal Graphs 359
Example 4
A point completes 1 revolution every 2 minutes around a circle of radius 5. Find the x
coordinate of the point as a function of time, if it starts at (5, 0).
Normally, we would express the x coordinate of a point on a unit circle
using x  r cos( ) , here we write the function x( )  5 cos( ) .
The rotation rate of 1 revolution every 2 minutes is an angular velocity. We can use this
rate to find a formula for the angle as a function of time. The point begins at an angle
of 0. Since the point rotates 1 revolution
x(θ)
= 2π radians every 2 minutes, it rotates π
radians every minute. After t minutes, it
will have rotated:
 (t )   t radians
θ
Composing this with the cosine function,
we obtain a function of time.
x(t )  5 cos( (t ))  5 cos( t )

Notice that this composition has the effect of a horizontal compression, changing the
period of the function.
To see how the period relates to the stretch or compression coefficient B in the equation
f (t )  sin Bt  , note that the period will be the time it takes to complete one full
revolution of a circle. If a point takes P minutes to complete 1 revolution, then the

While it is common to compose sine or cosine with functions involving time, the
composition can be done so that the input represents any reasonable quantity.
Example 6
A bicycle wheel with radius 14 inches has the bottom-most point on the wheel marked
in red. The wheel then begins rolling down the street. Write a formula for the height
above ground of the red point after the bicycle has travelled x inches.
The height of the point begins at the lowest value, 0,
increases to the highest value of 28 inches, and
continues to oscillate above and below a center height
of 14 inches. In terms of the angle of rotation, θ:
h( )  14 cos( )  14
In this case, x is representing a linear distance the
wheel has travelled, corresponding to an arclength
along the circle. Since arclength and angle can be
related by s  r , in this case we can write x  14 ,
which allows us to express the angle in terms of x:

At x = 0, the graph is at the midline value, which tells us the graph can most easily be

With these transformations, we are ready to answer the Ferris wheel problem from the
beginning of the section.
Example 9
The London Eye is a huge Ferris wheel with diameter 135 meters (443 feet) in London,
England, which completes one rotation every 30 minutes. Riders board from a platform
2 meters above the ground. Express a rider’s height above ground as a function of time
in minutes.
With a diameter of 135 meters, the wheel has a radius of 67.5 meters. The height will
oscillate with amplitude of 67.5 meters above and below the center.
Passengers board 2 meters above ground level, so the center of the wheel must be
located 67.5 + 2 = 69.5 meters above ground level. The midline of the oscillation will
be at 69.5 meters.
The wheel takes 30 minutes to complete 1 revolution, so the height will oscillate with
period of 30 minutes.
Lastly, since the rider boards at the lowest point, the height will start at the smallest
value and increase, following the shape of a flipped cosine curve.

feet and takes 3 minutes to complete a full rotation. Passengers

While these transformations are sufficient to represent many situations, occasionally we
encounter a sinusoidal function that does not have a vertical intercept at the lowest point,
highest point, or midline. In these cases, we need to use horizontal shifts. Recall that
when the inside of the function is factored, it reveals the horizontal shift.
Horizontal Shifts of Sine and Cosine

Section 6.2 Graphs of the Other Trig Functions 369

Section 6.2 Graphs of the Other Trig Functions
In this section, we will explore the graphs of the other four trigonometric functions.
We’ll begin with the tangent function. Recall that in Chapter 5 we defined tangent as y/x
or sine/cosine, so you can think of the tangent as the slope of a line through the origin
making the given angle with the positive x axis. At an angle of 0, the line would be
horizontal with a slope of zero. As the angle increases towards π/2, the slope increases
more and more. At an angle of π/2, the line would be vertical and the slope would be
undefined. Immediately past π/2, the line would have a steep negative slope, giving a
large negative tangent value. There is a break in the function at π/2, where the tangent
value jumps from large positive to large negative.
We can use these ideas along with the definition of
tangent to sketch a graph. Since tangent is defined
as sine/cosine, we can determine that tangent will
be zero when sine is zero: at -π, 0, π, and so on.
Likewise, tangent will be undefined when cosine is
zero: at -π/2, π/2, and so on.
The tangent is positive from 0 to π/2 and π to 3π/2,
corresponding to quadrants 1 and 3 of the unit
circle.
Using technology, we can obtain a graph of tangent on a standard grid.
Notice that the graph appears to repeat itself. For
any angle on the circle, there is a second angle with
the same slope and tangent value halfway around the
circle, so the graph repeats itself with a period of π;
we can see one continuous cycle from - π/2 to π/2,
before it jumps and repeats itself.
The graph has vertical asymptotes and the tangent is
undefined wherever a line at that angle would be
vertical: at π/2, 3π/2, and so on. While the domain
of the function is limited in this way, the range of the
function is all real numbers.
Features of the Graph of Tangent
The graph of the tangent function m( )  tan( )
The period of the tangent function is π
The domain of the tangent function is  

The range of the tangent function is all real numbers, (, )

370 Chapter 6
With the tangent function, like the sine and cosine functions, horizontal
stretches/compressions are distinct from vertical stretches/compressions. The horizontal
stretch can typically be determined from the period of the graph. With tangent graphs, it
is often necessary to determine a vertical stretch using a point on the graph.
Example 1
Find a formula for the function graphed
here.
The graph has the shape of a tangent
function, however the period appears to
be 8. We can see one full continuous
cycle from -4 to 4, suggesting a
horizontal stretch. To stretch π to 8, the
input values would have to be
8
multiplied by . Since the constant k


in f ( )  a tan  k  is the reciprocal of
8
the horizontal stretch , the equation must have form




f ( )  a tan   .
8 
We can also think of this the same way we did with sine and cosine. The period of the
tangent function is  but it has been transformed and now it is 8; remember the ratio of

the “normal period” to the “new period” is and so this becomes the value on the
8
inside of the function that tells us how it was horizontally stretched.
To find the vertical stretch a, we can use a point on the graph. Using the point (2, 2)

cos( )
Notice that the function is undefined when the cosine is 0, leading to a vertical asymptote
in the graph at π/2, 3π/2, etc. Since the cosine is always no more than one in absolute
value, the secant, being the reciprocal, will always be no less than one in absolute value.
Using technology, we can generate the graph. The graph of the cosine is shown dashed
so you can see the relationship.

occurs at 0, π, 2π, etc. The graph of sine is shown dashed along with the graph of the
cosecant.

Features of the Graph of Secant and Cosecant
The secant and cosecant graphs have period 2π like the sine and cosine functions.
Secant has domain  

 k , where k is an integer
2
Cosecant has domain   k , where k is an integer
Both secant and cosecant have range of (,1]  [1, )

Example 2

 
Sketch a graph of f ( )  2 csc    1 . What is the domain and range of this
2 
function?
The basic cosecant graph has vertical asymptotes at the integer multiples of π. Because

2
of the factor
inside the cosecant, the graph will be compressed by , so the vertical
2

2
asymptotes will be compressed to    k  2k . In other words, the graph will have



vertical asymptotes at the integer multiples of 2, and the domain will correspondingly
be   2k , where k is an integer.
The basic sine graph has a range of [-1, 1]. The vertical stretch by 2 will stretch this to
[-2, 2], and the vertical shift up 1 will shift the range of this function to [-1, 3].
The basic cosecant graph has a range of (,1]  [1, ) . The vertical stretch by 2 will
stretch this to (,2]  [2, ) , and the vertical shift up 1 will shift the range of this
function to (,1]  [3, ) .

Finally, we’ll look at the graph of cotangent. Based on its definition as the ratio of cosine
to sine, it will be undefined when the sine is zero: at at 0, π, 2π, etc. The resulting graph
is similar to that of the tangent. In fact, it is a horizontal flip and shift of the tangent
function, as we’ll see shortly in Example 3.

Features of the Graph of Cotangent
The cotangent graph has period π
Cotangent has domain   k , where k is an integer
Cotangent has range of all real numbers, (, )
In Section 6.1 we determined that the sine function was an odd function and the cosine
was an even function by observing the graph and establishing the negative angle
identities for cosine and sine. Similarly, you may notice from its graph that the tangent
function appears to be odd. We can verify this using the negative angle identities for sine
and cosine:
sin     sin  
tan   

  tan 
cos   cos 
The secant, like the cosine it is based on, is an even function, while the cosecant, like the
sine, is an odd function.

Section 6.3 Inverse Trig Functions
In previous sections we have evaluated the trigonometric functions at various angles, but
at times we need to know what angle would yield a specific sine, cosine, or tangent value.
For this, we need inverse functions. Recall that for a one-to-one function, if f (a)  b ,
then an inverse function would satisfy f 1 (b)  a .
You probably are already recognizing an issue – that the sine, cosine, and tangent
functions are not one-to-one functions. To define an inverse of these functions, we will
need to restrict the domain of these functions to yield a new function that is one-to-one.
We choose a domain for each function that includes the angle zero.

  

 2 2

Cosine, limited to 0,  

On these restricted domains, we can define the inverse sine, inverse cosine, and inverse
tangent functions.

Section 6.4 Solving Trig Equations
In Section 6.1, we determined the height of a rider on the London Eye Ferris wheel could
 
be determined by the equation h(t )  67.5 cos t   69.5 .
 15 
If we wanted to know length of time during which the rider is more than 100 meters
above ground, we would need to solve equations involving trig functions.
Solving using known values
In the last chapter, we learned sine and cosine values at commonly encountered angles.
We can use these to solve sine and cosine equations involving these common angles.

Looking at a graph confirms that there are more than these two solutions. While eight
are seen on this graph, there are an infinite number of solutions!

Remember that any coterminal angle will also have the same sine value, so any angle
coterminal with these two is also a solution. Coterminal angles can be found by adding
full rotations of 2π, so we end up with a set of solutions:

The x coordinate of a point on a circle can be found as x  r cos  , so the x coordinate

The depth will be 9 feet and the boat will

390 Chapter 6
Solving using the inverse trig functions
The solutions to sin   0.3 do not involve any of the “special” values of the trig
functions to we have learned. To find the solutions, we need to use the inverse sine
function.
Example 4
Use the inverse sine function to find one solution to sin   0.8 .
Since this is not a known unit circle value, calculating the inverse,   sin 1 0.8 . This
requires a calculator and we must approximate a value for this angle. If your calculator
is in degree mode, your calculator will give you an angle in degrees as the output. If
your calculator is in radian mode, your calculator will give you an angle in radians. In
radians,   sin 1 0.8  0.927 , or in degrees,   sin 1  0.8  53.130 .

If you are working with a composed trig function and you are not solving for an angle,
you will want to ensure that you are working in radians. In calculus, we will almost
always want to work with radians since they are unit-less.
Notice that the inverse trig functions do exactly what you would expect of any function –
for each input they give exactly one output. While this is necessary for these to be a
function, it means that to find all the solutions to an equation like sin   0.8 , we need
to do more than just evaluate the inverse function.
Example 5
Find all solutions to sin   0.8 .
We would expect two unique angles on one cycle to have
0.8
this sine value. In the previous example, we found one
θ
solution to be   sin 1 0.8  0.927 . To find the other, we
0.929
need to answer the question “what other angle has the same
1
sine value as an angle of 0.927?” On a unit circle, we
would recognize that the second angle would have the
same reference angle and reside in the second quadrant.
This second angle would be located at     sin 1 (0.8) ,
or approximately     0.927  2.214
To find more solutions we recall that angles coterminal with these two would have the
same sine value, so we can add full cycles of 2π.

  sin 1 (0.8)  2k and     sin 1 (0.8)  2k where k is an integer,
or approximately,   0.927  2k and   2.214  2k where k is an integer.

First we will turn our calculator to degree mode. Using the inverse, we can find one
 8
solution x  sin 1     62.734 . While this angle satisfies the equation, it does not
 9
lie in the domain we are looking for. To find the angles in the desired domain, we start
looking for additional solutions.
First, an angle coterminal with  62.734 will have the same sine. By adding a full
rotation, we can find an angle in the desired domain with the same sine.
x  62.734  360  297.266
There is a second angle in the desired domain that lies in the third quadrant. Notice that
62.734 is the reference angle for all solutions, so this second solution would be
62.734 past 180
x  62.734  180  242.734
The two solutions on 0  x  360 are x = 297.266 and x = 242.734
Example 7
Find all solutions to tanx   3 on 0  x  2 .
Using the inverse tangent function, we can find one solution x  tan 1 3  1.249 .
Unlike the sine and cosine, the tangent function only attains any output value once per
cycle, so there is no second solution in any one cycle.
By adding π, a full period of tangent function, we can find
a second angle with the same tangent value. If additional
solutions were desired, we could continue to add multiples
of π, so all solutions would take on the form
x  1.249  k , however we are only interested in
0  x  2 .
x  1.249    4.391

Thinking back to the circle, a second angle with the same

As before, with a horizontal compression it can be helpful to make a substitution,
u  3t . Making this substitution simplifies the equation to a form we have already
solved.
cosu   0.2

u  cos 1 0.2  1.369

A second solution on one cycle would be located in the fourth quadrant with the same
reference angle.
u  2  1.369  4.914
In this case, we need all solutions on two cycles, so we need to find the solutions on the
second cycle. We can do this by adding a full rotation to the previous two solutions.
u  1.369  2  7.653
u  4.914  2  11.197
Undoing the substitution, we obtain our four solutions:
3t = 1.369, so t = 0.456
3t = 4.914 so t = 1.638
3t = 7.653, so t = 2.551
3t = 11.197, so t = 3.732

This angle is in the second quadrant. A second angle with
the same cosine would be symmetric in the third quadrant.
This angle could be represented as u = -2.040, but we need a
coterminal positive angle, so we add 2π:
u  2  2.040  4.244

u = 2.040

u = -2.040
or 4.244

Now we can undo the substitution to solve for t



t  2.040 so t = 9.740 minutes after the start of the ride

t  4.244 so t = 20.264 minutes after the start of the ride

A rider will be at 100 meters after 9.740 minutes, and again after 20.264. From the
behavior of the height graph, we know the rider will be above 100 meters between these
times. A rider will be above 100 meters for 20.265-9.740 = 10.523 minutes of the ride.

Section 6.5 Modeling with Trigonometric Functions
Solving right triangles for angles
In Section 5.5, we used trigonometry on a right triangle to solve for the sides of a triangle
given one side and an additional angle. Using the inverse trig functions, we can solve for
the angles of a right triangle given two sides.
Example 1
An airplane needs to fly to an airfield located 300 miles east and 200 miles north of its
current location. At what heading should the airplane fly? In other words, if we ignore
air resistance or wind speed, how many degrees north of east should the airplane fly?
We might begin by drawing a picture and labeling all of
the known information. Drawing a triangle, we see we
are looking for the angle α. In this triangle, the side
opposite the angle α is 200 miles and the side adjacent
is 300 miles. Since we know the values for the
opposite and adjacent sides, it makes sense to use the
tangent function.

Example 3
In a video game design, a map shows the location of other characters relative to the
player, who is situated at the origin, and the direction they are facing. A character
currently shows on the map at coordinates (-3, 5). If the player rotates
counterclockwise by 20 degrees, then the objects in the map will correspondingly rotate
20 degrees clockwise. Find the new coordinates of the character.
To rotate the position of the character, we can imagine it
as a point on a circle, and we will change the angle of
the point by 20 degrees. To do so, we first need to find
the radius of this circle and the original angle.
Drawing a right triangle inside the circle, we can find
the radius using the Pythagorean Theorem:

To find the angle, we need to decide first if we are going to find the acute angle of the
triangle, the reference angle, or if we are going to find the angle measured in standard
position. While either approach will work, in this case we will do the latter. Since for
any point on a circle we know x  r cos( ) , using our given information we get

While there are two angles that have this cosine value, the angle of 120.964 degrees is
in the second quadrant as desired, so it is the angle we were looking for.

Rotating the point clockwise by 20 degrees, the angle of the point will decrease to
100.964 degrees. We can then evaluate the coordinates of the rotated point
x  34 cos(100.964)  1.109
y  34 sin(100.964)  5.725

The coordinates of the character on the rotated map will be (-1.109, 5.725).

Section 6.5 Modeling with Trigonometric Functions 399
Modeling with sinusoidal functions
Many modeling situations involve functions that are periodic. Previously we learned that
sinusoidal functions are a special type of periodic function. Problems that involve
quantities that oscillate can often be modeled by a sine or cosine function and once we
create a suitable model for the problem we can use that model to answer various
questions.
Example 4
The hours of daylight in Seattle oscillate from a low of 8.5 hours in January to a high of
16 hours in July4. When should you plant a garden if you want to do it during a month
where there are 14 hours of daylight?
To model this, we first note that the hours of daylight oscillate with a period of 12
months. With a low of 8.5 and a high of 16, the midline will be halfway between these
16  8.5
values, at
 12.25 . The amplitude will be half the difference between the
2
16  8.5
highest and lowest values:
 3.75 , or equivalently the distance from the
2
midline to the high or low value, 16-12.25=3.75. Letting January be t = 0, the graph
starts at the lowest value, so it can be modeled as a flipped cosine graph. Putting this
together, we get a model:
 
h(t )  3.75 cos t   12.25
3.75
y=12.25

-cos(t) represents the flipped cosine,
3.75 is the amplitude,
12.25 is the midline,
2 
 corresponds to the horizontal stretch,
12 6
found by using the ratio of the “original period / new period”
h(t) is our model for hours of day light t months after January.
To find when there will be 14 hours of daylight, we solve h(t) = 14.

There will be 14 hours of daylight 3.927 months into the year, or near the end of April.
While there would be a second time in the year when there are 14 hours of daylight,
since we are planting a garden, we would want to know the first solution, in spring, so
we do not need to find the second solution in this case.

Example 6
An object is connected to the wall with a spring that has a
natural length of 20 cm. The object is pulled back 8 cm past
the natural length and released. The object oscillates 3 times
per second. Find an equation for the horizontal position of the
object ignoring the effects of friction. How much time during each cycle is the object
more than 27 cm from the wall?
If we use the distance from the wall, x, as the desired output, then the object will
oscillate equally on either side of the spring’s natural length of 20, putting the midline
of the function at 20 cm.
If we release the object 8 cm past the natural length, the amplitude of the oscillation will
be 8 cm.
We are beginning at the largest value and so this function can most easily be modeled
using a cosine function.
Since the object oscillates 3 times per second, it has a frequency of 3 and the period of
one oscillation is 1/3 of second. Using this we find the horizontal compression using the
2
 6 .
ratios of the periods:
1/ 3

Section 6.5 Modeling with Trigonometric Functions 401
Using all this, we can build our model:
x(t )  8 cos6 t   20
To find when the object is 27 cm from the wall, we can solve x(t) = 27
Isolating the cosine

Based on the shape of the graph, we can
conclude that the object will spend the first
0.0268 seconds more than 27 cm from the
wall. Based on the symmetry of the function,
the object will spend another 0.0268 seconds
more than 27 cm from the wall at the end of
the cycle. Altogether, the object spends
0.0536 seconds each cycle at a distance
greater than 27 cm from the wall.

In some problems, we can use trigonometric functions to model behaviors more
complicated than the basic sinusoidal function.
Example 7
A rigid rod with length 10 cm is attached
to a circle of radius 4cm at point A as
shown here. The point B is able to freely
move along the horizontal axis, driving a
piston5. If the wheel rotates
counterclockwise at 5 revolutions per
second, find the location of point B as a
function of time. When will the point B
be 12 cm from the center of the circle?

A
4cm

10 cm

B

To find the position of point B, we can begin by finding the coordinates of point A.
Since it is a point on a circle with radius 4, we can express its coordinates as
(4 cos( ),4 sin( )) , where θ is the angle shown.
5

For an animation of this situation, see http://www.mathdemos.org/mathdemos/sinusoidapp/engine1.gif

402 Chapter 6
The angular velocity is 5 revolutions per second, or equivalently 10π radians per
second. After t seconds, the wheel will rotate by   10 t radians. Substituting this,
we can find the coordinates of A in terms of t.
(4 cos(10 t ),4 sin(10 t ))
Notice that this is the same value we would have obtained by observing that the period
of the rotation is 1/5 of a second and calculating the stretch/compression factor:

" original " 2
 10 .
" new" 1
5
Now that we have the coordinates of the point
A, we can relate this to the point B. By
drawing a vertical line segment from A to the
horizontal axis, we can form a right triangle.
The height of the triangle is the y coordinate
of the point A: 4sin(10 t ) . Using the
Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the base
length of the triangle:

 4sin(10 t )   b2  102

A

10 cm
B
b

b2  100  16sin 2 (10 t )
b  100  16sin 2 (10 t )

Looking at the x coordinate of the point A, we can see that the triangle we drew is
shifted to the right of the y axis by 4cos(10 t ) . Combining this offset with the length
of the base of the triangle gives the x coordinate of the point B:
x(t )  4cos(10 t )  100 16sin 2 (10 t )

To solve for when the point B will be 12 cm from the center of the circle, we need to
solve x(t) = 12.
12  4cos(10 t )  100  16sin 2 (10 t )

Isolate the square root

12  4cos(10 t )  100  16sin 2 (10 t )

Square both sides

12  4cos(10 t ) 

At this point, we can utilize the Pythagorean Identity, which tells us that

Section 7.1 Solving Trigonometric Equations with Identities
In the last chapter, we solved basic trigonometric equations. In this section, we explore
the techniques needed to solve more complicated trig equations.
Building from what we already know makes this a much easier task.
Consider the function f ( x)  2 x 2  x . If you were asked to solve f ( x)  0 , it require
simple algebra:
Factor
2x 2  x  0
Giving solutions
x(2 x  1)  0

x = 0 or x = 

Similarly, for g (t )  sin(t ) , if we asked you to solve g (t )  0 , you can solve this using
unit circle values:
sin(t )  0 for t  0,  , 2 and so on.
Using these same concepts, we consider the composition of these two functions:
f ( g (t ))  2(sin(t )) 2  (sin(t ))  2 sin 2 (t )  sin(t )
This creates an equation that is a polynomial trig function. With these types of functions,
we use algebraic techniques like factoring and the quadratic formula, along with
trigonometric identities and techniques, to solve equations.
As a reminder, here are some of the essential trigonometric identities that we have
learned so far:

Solve 2 sin 2 (t )  sin(t )  0 for all solutions with 0  t  2 .
This equation kind of looks like a quadratic equation, but with sin(t) in place of an
algebraic variable (we often call such an equation “quadratic in sine”). As with all
quadratic equations, we can use factoring techniques or the quadratic formula. This
expression factors nicely, so we proceed by factoring out the common factor of sin(t):
sin(t )2 sin(t )  1  0
Using the zero product theorem, we know that the product on the left will equal zero if
either factor is zero, allowing us to break this equation into two cases:
or
sin(t )  0
2 sin(t )  1  0

Since the left side of this equation is quadratic in secant, we can try to factor it, and
hope it factors nicely.
If it is easier to for you to consider factoring without the trig function present, consider
using a substitution u  sec(t ) , resulting in 3u 2  5u  2  0 , and then try to factor:

3u 2  5u  2  (3u  1)(u  2)
Undoing the substitution,

1. Solve 2 sin 2 (t )  3 sin(t )  1  0 for all solutions with 0  t  2 .
When solving some trigonometric equations, it becomes necessary to first rewrite the
equation using trigonometric identities. One of the most common is the Pythagorean
Identity, sin 2 ( )  cos 2 ( )  1which allows you to rewrite sin 2 ( ) in terms of cos 2 ( )
or vice versa,

This identity becomes very useful whenever an equation involves a combination of sine
and cosine functions.
Example 3
Solve 2 sin 2 (t )  cos(t )  1 for all solutions with 0  t  2 .
Since this equation has a mix of sine and cosine functions, it becomes more complicated
to solve. It is usually easier to work with an equation involving only one trig function.
This is where we can use the Pythagorean Identity.

At this point, you may be tempted to divide both sides of the equation by sin(x). Resist
the urge. When we divide both sides of an equation by a quantity, we are assuming the
quantity is never zero. In this case, when sin(x) = 0 the equation is satisfied, so we’d
lose those solutions if we divided by the sine.
To avoid this problem, we can rearrange the equation so that one side is zero1.
Factoring out sin(x) from both parts
sin( x)  3 sin( x) cos( x)  0
sin( x)1  3 cos( x)  0
From here, we can see we get solutions when sin( x)  0 or 1  3 cos( x)  0 .
Using our knowledge of the special angles of the unit circle
sin( x)  0 when x = 0 or x = π.
For the second equation, we will need the inverse cosine.

You technically can divide by sin(x) as long as you separately consider the case where sin(x) = 0. Since it
is easy to forget this step, the factoring approach used in the example is recommended.

Section 7.2 Addition and Subtraction Identities
In this section, we begin expanding our repertoire of trigonometric identities.
Identities
The sum and difference identities
cos(   )  cos( ) cos( )  sin( ) sin( )
cos(   )  cos( ) cos( )  sin( ) sin( )
sin(   )  sin( ) cos( )  cos( ) sin( )
sin(   )  sin( ) cos( )  cos( ) sin( )
We will prove the difference of angles identity for cosine. The rest of the identities can
be derived from this one.
Proof of the difference of angles identity for cosine
Consider two points on a unit circle:
P at an angle of α from the positive x axis
with coordinates cos( ), sin( )
Q at an angle of β with coordinates
cos( ), sin( )
Notice the measure of angle POQ is α – β.
Label two more points:
C at an angle of α – β, with coordinates
cos(   ), sin(   ) ,
D at the point (1, 0).

C
P
Q
α

α-β
β

O

Notice that the distance from C to D is the
same as the distance from P to Q because
triangle COD is a rotation of triangle POQ.
Using the distance formula to find the distance from P to Q yields

cos( )  cos( )2  sin( )  sin( )2
Expanding this
cos 2 ( )  2 cos( ) cos( )  cos 2 ( )  sin 2 ( )  2 sin( ) sin(  )  sin 2 ( )

Applying the Pythagorean Identity and simplifying
2  2 cos( ) cos( )  2 sin( ) sin(  )

D

418 Chapter 7
Similarly, using the distance formula to find the distance from C to D

cos(   )  12  sin(   )  02
Expanding this
cos 2 (   )  2 cos(   )  1  sin 2 (   )

Applying the Pythagorean Identity and simplifying
 2 cos(   )  2
Since the two distances are the same we set these two formulas equal to each other and
simplify
2  2 cos( ) cos( )  2 sin( ) sin(  )   2 cos(   )  2
2  2 cos( ) cos( )  2 sin( ) sin( )  2 cos(   )  2
cos( ) cos( )  sin( ) sin( )  cos(   )

Notice that the result is a stretch of the sine added to a different stretch of the cosine, but
both have the same horizontal compression, which results in the same period.
We might ask now whether this process can be reversed – can a combination of a sine
and cosine of the same period be written as a single sinusoidal function? To explore this,
we will look in general at the procedure used in the example above.
f ( x)  A sin( Bx  C )
 Asin( Bx) cos(C )  cos( Bx) sin(C )
 A sin( Bx) cos(C )  A cos( Bx) sin(C )
 A cos(C) sin( Bx)  A sin(C ) cos( Bx)

Use the sum of angles identity
Distribute the A
Rearrange the terms a bit

Based on this result, if we have an expression of the form m sin( Bx)  n cos( Bx) , we
could rewrite it as a single sinusoidal function if we can find values A and C so that
m sin( Bx)  n cos( Bx)  A cos(C) sin( Bx)  A sin(C ) cos( Bx) , which will require that:
m
 cos(C )
m  A cos(C )
which can be rewritten as A
n  A sin(C )
n

We can use either of the last two equations to solve for possible values of C. Since there
will usually be two possible solutions, we will need to look at both to determine which
quadrant C is in and determine which solution for C satisfies both equations.

Section 7.3 Double Angle Identities
Two special cases of the sum of angles identities arise often enough that we choose to
state these identities separately.

cos(2 )  cos 2 ( )  sin 2 ( )

Try it Now
1. Show cos(2 )  cos 2 ( )  sin 2 ( ) by using the sum of angles identity for cosine.

For the cosine double angle identity, there are three forms of the identity stated because
the basic form, cos(2 )  cos 2 ( )  sin 2 ( ) , can be rewritten using the Pythagorean
Identity. Rearranging the Pythagorean Identity results in the
equality cos 2 ( )  1  sin 2 ( ) , and by substituting this into the basic double angle
identity, we obtain the second form of the double angle identity.

cos(2 )  cos 2 ( )  sin 2 ( )
cos(2 )  1  sin 2 ( )  sin 2 ( )
cos(2 )  1  2 sin 2 ( )

With three choices for how to rewrite the double angle, we need to consider which will
be the most useful. To simplify this expression, it would be great if the denominator
would cancel with something in the numerator, which would require a factor of
cos(t )  sin(t ) in the numerator, which is most likely to occur if we rewrite the
numerator with a mix of sine and cosine.

2. Use an identity to find the exact value of cos 2 75  sin 2 75 .
As with other identities, we can also use the double angle identities for solving equations.
Example 4
Solve cos(2t )  cos(t ) for all solutions with 0  t  2 .
In general when solving trig equations, it makes things more complicated when we have
a mix of sines and cosines and when we have a mix of functions with different periods.
In this case, we can use a double angle identity to rewrite the cos(2t). When choosing
which form of the double angle identity to use, we notice that we have a cosine on the
right side of the equation. We try to limit our equation to one trig function, which we
can do by choosing the version of the double angle formula for cosine that only
involves cosine.

Example 5
A cannonball is fired with velocity of 100 meters per second. If it is launched at an
angle of θ, the vertical component of the velocity will be 100 sin( ) and the horizontal
component will be 100 cos( ) . Ignoring wind resistance, the height of the cannonball
will follow the equation h(t )  4.9t 2  100 sin( )t and horizontal position will follow
the equation x(t )  100 cos( )t . If you want to hit a target 900 meters away, at what
angle should you aim the cannon?
To hit the target 900 meters away, we want x(t )  900 at the time when the cannonball
hits the ground, when h(t )  0 . To solve this problem, we will first solve for the time,
t, when the cannonball hits the ground. Our answer will depend upon the angle  .
h(t )  0

 4.9t  100 sin( )
100 sin( )

4.9

Factor
Break this apart to find two solutions

Solve for t

This shows that the height is 0 twice, once at t = 0 when the cannonball is fired, and
again when the cannonball hits the ground after flying through the air. This second
value of t gives the time when the ball hits the ground in terms of the angle  . We
want the horizontal distance x(t) to be 900 when the ball hits the ground, in other words
100 sin( )
when t 
.

Since the target is 900 m away we start with
x(t )  900

Section 7.4 Modeling Changing Amplitude and Midline
While sinusoidal functions can model a variety of behaviors, it is often necessary to
combine sinusoidal functions with linear and exponential curves to model real
applications and behaviors. We begin this section by looking at changes to the midline of
a sinusoidal function. Recall that the midline describes the middle, or average value, of
the sinusoidal function.
Changing Midlines
Example 1
A population of elk currently averages 2000 elk, and that average has been growing by
4% each year. Due to seasonal fluctuation, the population oscillates from 50 below
average in the winter up to 50 above average in the summer. Find a function that
models the number of elk after t years.
There are two components to the behavior of the elk population: the changing average,
and the oscillation. The average is an exponential growth, starting at 2000 and growing
by 4% each year. Writing a formula for this:
average  initial (1  r )t  2000(1  0.04)t
For the oscillation, since the population oscillates 50 above and below average, the
amplitude will be 50. Since it takes one year for the population to cycle, the period is 1.
original period 2
We find the value of the horizontal stretch coefficient B 

 2 .
new period
1
Additionally, since we weren’t told when t was first measured we will have to decide if
t = 0 corresponds to winter, or summer. If we choose winter then the shape of the
function would be a negative cosine, since it starts at the lowest value.
Putting it all together, the equation would be:
P(t )  50cos(2 t )  midline
Since the midline represents the average population, we substitute in the exponential
function into the population equation to find our final equation:
P(t )  50cos(2 t )  2000(1  0.04)t

This is an example of changing midline – in this case an exponentially changing midline.
Changing Midline
A function of the form f (t )  A sin( Bt )  g (t ) will oscillate above and below the
average given by the function g(t).

Section 7.4 Modeling Changing Amplitude and Midline 443
Changing midlines can be exponential, linear, or any other type of function. Here are
some examples:
Linear midline

Exponential midline

f (t )  A sin  Bt   (mt  b)

f (t )  A sin  Bt   (abt )

Quadratic midline

f (t )  A sin  Bt   (at 2 )

Since we are given the value of the horizontal compression coefficient we can calculate

Since the sine function is at the midline at the beginning of a cycle and halfway through
a cycle, we would expect this function to be at the midline at t = 0 and t = 2, since 2 is
half the full period of 4. Based on this, we expect the points (0, 5) and (2, 9) to be
points on the midline. We can clearly see that this is not a constant function and so we
use the two points to calculate a linear function: midline  mt  b . From these two
points we can calculate a slope:
95 4
m

Combining this with the initial value of 5, we have the midline: midline  2t  5 , giving

Example 3
The number of tourists visiting a ski and hiking resort averages 4000 people annually
and oscillates seasonally, 1000 above and below the average. Due to a marketing
campaign, the average number of tourists has been increasing by 200 each year. Write
an equation for the number of tourists after t years, beginning at the peak season.
Again there are two components to this problem: the oscillation and the average. For
the oscillation, the number of tourists oscillates 1000 above and below average, giving
an amplitude of 1000. Since the oscillation is seasonal, it has a period of 1 year. Since
we are given a starting point of “peak season”, we will model this scenario with a
cosine function.
So far, this gives an equation in the form N (t )  1000cos(2 t )  midline
The average is currently 4000, and is increasing by
200 each year. This is a constant rate of change, so
this is linear growth, average  4000  200t .
Combining these two pieces gives a function for the
number of tourists:
N (t )  1000cos(2 t )  4000  200t
Try it Now
1. Given the function g ( x)  ( x2  1)  8cos( x) , describe the midline and amplitude
using words.

Section 7.4 Modeling Changing Amplitude and Midline 445
Changing Amplitude
There are also situations in which the amplitude of a sinusoidal function does not stay
constant. Back in Chapter 6, we modeled the motion of a spring using a sinusoidal
function, but had to ignore friction in doing so. If there were friction in the system, we
would expect the amplitude of the oscillation to decrease over time. In the equation
f (t )  A sin( Bt )  k , A gives the amplitude of the oscillation, we can allow the amplitude
to change by replacing this constant A with a function A(t).
Changing Amplitude
A function of the form f (t )  A(t ) sin( Bt )  k will oscillate above and below the
midline with an amplitude given by A(t).
When thinking about a spring with amplitude decreasing over time, it is tempting to use
the simplest tool for the job – a linear function. But if we attempt to model the amplitude
with a decreasing linear function, such as A(t )  10  t , we quickly see the problem when
we graph the equation f (t )  (10  t ) sin(4t ) .

While the amplitude decreases at first as intended, the amplitude hits zero at t = 10, then
continues past the intercept, increasing in absolute value, which is not the expected
behavior. This behavior and function may model the situation on a restricted domain and
we might try to chalk the rest of it up to model breakdown, but in fact springs just don’t
behave like this.
A better model, as you will learn later in physics and calculus, would show the amplitude
decreasing by a fixed percentage each second, leading to an exponential decay model for
the amplitude.
Damped Harmonic Motion
Damped harmonic motion, exhibited by springs subject to friction, follows a model of
the form
f (t )  ab t sin( Bt )  k or f (t )  ae rt sin( Bt )  k .

446 Chapter 7
Example 4
A spring with natural length of 20 inches is pulled back 6 inches and released. It
oscillates once every 2 seconds. Its amplitude decreases by 20% each second. Find a
function that models the position of the spring t seconds after being released.
Since the spring will oscillate on either side of the natural length, the midline will be at
20 inches. The oscillation has a period of 2 seconds, and so the horizontal compression
coefficient is B   . Additionally, it begins at the furthest distance from the wall,
indicating a cosine model.
Meanwhile, the amplitude begins at 6 inches,
and decreases by 20% each second, giving an
amplitude function of A(t )  6(1  0.20) t .
Combining this with the sinusoidal
information gives a function for the position
of the spring:
f (t )  6(0.80) t cos( t )  20
Example 5

f (t )  A(t ) cos(8 t )  30 .
The oscillation has a period of

For the amplitude function, we notice that the amplitude starts at 10 cm, and decreases
to 5 cm after 2 seconds. This gives two points (0, 10) and (2, 5) that must be satisfied
by an exponential function: A(0)  10 and A(2)  5 . Since the function is exponential,
we can use the form A(t )  ab t . Substituting the first point, 10  ab 0 , so a = 10.

here was arbitrary – it would have worked just was well to use a cosine.
The carrier wave, with a frequency of 2000 cycles per second, would have period

The musical tone, with a frequency of 110 cycles per second, would have a period of

110
form 3sin(220 t ) . Again our choice of using a sine function is arbitrary.
The musical wave is acting as the amplitude of the carrier wave, so we will multiply the
musical tone’s function by the carrier wave function, resulting in the function
f (t )  3sin(220 t )sin(4000 t )

Chapter 8: Further Applications of Trigonometry
In this chapter, we will explore additional applications of trigonometry. We will begin
with an extension of the right triangle trigonometry we explored in Chapter 5 to situations
involving non-right triangles. We will explore the polar coordinate system and
parametric equations as new ways of describing curves in the plane. In the process, we
will introduce vectors and an alternative way of writing complex numbers, two important
mathematical tools we use when analyzing and modeling the world around us.

Section 8.1 Non-Right Triangles: Laws of Sines and Cosines
Although right triangles allow us to solve many applications, it is more common to find
scenarios where the triangle we are interested in does not have a right angle.
Two radar stations located 20 miles apart
both detect a UFO located between them.
The angle of elevation measured by the
first station is 35 degrees. The angle of
elevation measured by the second station is
15 degrees. What is the altitude of the
UFO?

15°

35°
20 miles

We see that the triangle formed by the UFO and the two stations is not a right triangle.
Of course, in any triangle we could draw an altitude, a perpendicular line from one
vertex to the opposite side, forming two right triangles, but it would be nice to have
methods for working directly with non-right triangles. In this section we will expand
upon the right triangle trigonometry we learned in Chapter 5, and adapt it to non-right
triangles.
Law of Sines
Given an arbitrary non-right triangle, we can drop an altitude, which we temporarily label
h, to create two right triangles.

Solving both equations for h, we get b sin( )  h and a sin(  )  h . Since the h is the

conclude that

straightforward case, we know two angles and one of the corresponding sides.
Example 1
In the triangle shown here, solve for the
unknown sides and angle.
Solving for the unknown angle is relatively
easy, since the three angles must add to 180
degrees. From this, we can determine that
γ = 180° – 50° – 30° = 100°.

To find an unknown side, we need to know the corresponding angle, and we also need

Since we know the angle 50° and its corresponding side, we can use this for one of the
two ratios. To look for side b, we would use its corresponding angle, 30°.

Since the angles in the triangle add to 180 degrees, the unknown angle of the triangle

us to set up a Law of Sines relationship:

In this second case, if β ≈ 132°, then α would be α = 180° – 85° – 132° = –37°, which
doesn’t make sense, so the only possibility for this triangle is β = 48.3438°.
With a second angle, we can now easily find the third angle, since the angles must add
to 180°, so α = 180° – 85° – 48.3438° = 46.6562°.
Now that we know α, we can proceed as in earlier examples to find the unknown side a.

Notice that in the problem above, when we use Law of Sines to solve for an unknown
angle, there can be two possible solutions. This is called the ambiguous case, and can
arise when we know two sides and a non-included angle. In the ambiguous case we may
find that a particular set of given information can lead to 2, 1 or no solution at all.
However, when an accurate picture of the triangle or suitable context is available, we can
determine which angle is desired.

Law of Cosines
Suppose a boat leaves port, travels 10 miles, turns 20 degrees, and
travels another 8 miles. How far from port is the boat?

Unfortunately, while the Law of Sines lets us address many non-right
triangle cases, it does not allow us to address triangles where the one
known angle is included between two known sides, which means it is
not a corresponding angle for a known side. For this, we need another
tool.
Given an arbitrary non-right triangle, we can
drop an altitude, which we temporarily label
h, to create two right triangles. We will
divide the base b into two pieces, one of
which we will temporarily label x. From
this picture, we can establish the right
triangle relationship

Both of these equations can be solved for h 2

h2  c2  x2
and
h 2  a 2  b  x 
Since the left side of each equation is h 2 , the right sides must be equal

a 2  c 2  b 2  2bc cos( )



Simplify
Isolate a 2
Substitute in c cos( )  x from above

This result is called the Law of Cosines. Depending upon which side we dropped the
altitude down from, we could have established this relationship using any of the angles.
The important thing to note is that the right side of the equation involves an angle and the
sides adjacent to that angle – the left side of the equation involves the side opposite that
angle.

Given a triangle with angles and opposite sides labeled as shown,
a 2  c 2  b 2  2bc cos( )

Notice that if one of the angles of the triangle is 90 degrees, cos(90°) = 0, so the formula
Simplifies to

c2  a2  b2
You should recognize this as the Pythagorean Theorem. Indeed, the Law of Cosines is
sometimes called the Generalized Pythagorean Theorem, since it extends the
Pythagorean Theorem to non-right triangles.
Example 6
Returning to our question from earlier, suppose a boat leaves port,
travels 10 miles, turns 20 degrees, and travels another 8 miles. How far
from port is the boat?

8 mi

The boat turned 20 degrees, so the obtuse angle of the non-right triangle
shown in the picture is the supplemental angle, 180° - 20° = 160°.

10 mi

With this, we can utilize the Law of Cosines to find the missing side of
the obtuse triangle – the distance from the boat to port.

Since we have the angle included between the two known sides, we can turn to Law of

458 Chapter 8
Since the left side of any of the Law of Cosines equations involves the side opposite the
known angle, the left side in this situation will involve the side x. The other two sides
can be used in either order.

x 2  10 2  12 2  2(10)(12) cos(30)

Take the square root

Now that we know an angle and its corresponding side, we can use the Law of Sines to
fill in the remaining angles of the triangle. Solving for angle θ,

 10 sin(30) 

  56.256
 6.013 
The other possibility for θ would be θ = 180° – 56.256° = 123.744°. In the original
picture, θ is an acute angle, so 123.744° doesn’t make sense if we assume the picture is
drawn to scale.
Proceeding with θ = 56.256°, we can then find the third angle of the triangle:
  180  30  56.256  93.744 .
In addition to solving for the missing side opposite one known angle, the Law of Cosines
allows us to find the angles of a triangle when we know all three sides.

3. Given   25, b  10, and c  20 find the missing side and angles.
Notice that since the inverse cosine can return any angle between 0 and 180 degrees,
there will not be any ambiguous cases when using Law of Cosines to find an angle.
Example 9
On many cell phones with GPS, an approximate location can be given before the GPS
signal is received. This is done by a process called triangulation, which works by using
the distance from two known points. Suppose there are two cell phone towers within
range of you, located 6000 feet apart along a straight highway that runs east to west, and
you know you are north of the highway. Based on the signal delay, it can be
determined you are 5050 feet from the first tower, and 2420 feet from the second.
Determine your position north and east of the first tower, and determine how far you are
from the highway.
For simplicity, we start by drawing a picture and
labeling our given information. Using the Law
of Cosines, we can solve for the angle θ.

2420 2  6000 2  5050 2  2(5050)(6000) cos( )

  cos 1 (0.9183)  23.328
Using this angle, we could then use right
triangles to find the position of the cell phone
relative to the western tower.

You are 5050 ft from the tower and 23.328 north of east (or, equivalently, 66.672° east
of north). Specifically, you are about 4637 feet east and 2000 feet north of the first
tower.

460 Chapter 8
Note that if you didn’t know whether you were north or south of the towers, our
calculations would have given two possible locations, one north of the highway and one
south. To resolve this ambiguity in real world situations, locating a position using
triangulation requires a signal from a third tower.
Example 10
To measure the height of a hill, a woman measures the angle of elevation to the top of
the hill to be 24 degrees. She then moves back 200 feet and measures the angle of
elevation to be 22 degrees. Find the height of the hill.
As with many problems of this nature, it will be helpful to draw a picture.

h
22°
200 ft

24°

Notice there are three triangles formed here – the right triangle including the height h
and the 22 degree angle, the right triangle including the height h and the 24 degree
angle, and the (non-right) obtuse triangle including the 200 ft side. Since this is the
triangle we have the most information for, we will begin with it. It may seem odd to
work with this triangle since it does not include the desired side h, but we don’t have
enough information to work with either of the right triangles yet.
We can find the obtuse angle of the triangle, since it and the angle of 24 degrees
complete a straight line – a 180 degree angle. The obtuse angle must be 180° - 24° =
156°. From this, we can determine that the third angle is 2°. We know one side is 200
feet, and its corresponding angle is 2°, so by introducing a temporary variable x for one
of the other sides (as shown below), we can use Law of Sines to solve for this length x.

Section 8.2 Polar Coordinates
The coordinate system we are most familiar with is called the Cartesian coordinate
system, a rectangular plane divided into four quadrants by the horizontal and vertical
axes.
y
In earlier chapters, we often found the Cartesian coordinates of
a point on a circle at a given angle from the positive horizontal
axis. Sometimes that angle, along with the point’s distance
from the origin, provides a more useful way of describing the
point’s location than conventional Cartesian coordinates.
Polar Coordinates
Polar coordinates of a point consist of an ordered pair, (r , ) , where r is the distance
from the point to the origin, and θ is the angle measured in standard position.
Notice that if we were to “grid” the plane for polar coordinates, it
would look like the graph to the right, with circles at incremental radii,
and rays drawn at incremental angles.

Polar Equations
Just as a Cartesian equation like y  x 2 describes a relationship between x and y values
on a Cartesian grid, a polar equation can be written describing a relationship between r
and θ values on the polar grid.
Example 5
Sketch a graph of the polar equation r   .
The equation r   describes all the points for which the radius r is equal to the angle.
To visualize this relationship, we can create a table of values.

We can plot these points on the plane, and then sketch a
curve that fits the points. The resulting graph is a spiral.
Notice that the resulting graph cannot be the result of a
function of the form y = f(x), as it does not pass the
vertical line test, even though it resulted from a function
giving r in terms of θ.
Although it is nice to see polar equations on polar
grids, it is more common for polar graphs to be
graphed on the Cartesian coordinate system, and so,
the remainder of the polar equations will be graphed
accordingly.
The spiral graph above on a Cartesian grid is shown
here.
Example 6
Sketch a graph of the polar equation r  3 .
Recall that when a variable does not show up in the equation, it
is saying that it does not matter what value that variable has;
the output for the equation will remain the same.
For example, the Cartesian equation y = 3 describes all the
points where y = 3, no matter what the x values are, producing
a horizontal line.
Likewise, this polar equation is describing all the points at a distance of 3 from the
origin, no matter what the angle is, producing the graph of a circle.

Section 8.2 Polar Coordinates 471
The normal settings on graphing calculators and software graph on the Cartesian
coordinate system with y being a function of x, where the graphing utility asks for f(x), or
simply y =.
To graph polar equations, you may need to change the mode of your calculator to Polar.
You will know you have been successful in changing the mode if you now have r as a
function of θ, where the graphing utility asks for r(θ), or simply r =.
Example 7
Sketch a graph of the polar equation r  4 cos( ) , and find an
interval on which it completes one cycle.
While we could again create a table, plot the corresponding
points, and connect the dots, we can also turn to technology to
directly graph it. Using technology, we produce the graph shown
here, a circle passing through the origin.
Since this graph appears to close a loop and repeat itself, we might ask what interval of
θ values yields the entire graph. At θ = 0, r  4 cos(0)  4 , yielding the point (4, 0). We
want the next θ value when the graph returns to the point (4, 0). Solving for when x = 4
is equivalent to solving r cos( )  4 . Substituting the equation for r gives
Dividing by 4 and simplifying
4 cos( ) cos( )  4
2
This has solutions when
cos ( )  1
Solving these gives solutions
cos( )  1 or cos( )  1
  0 or   
This shows us at 0 radians we are at the point (0, 4), and again at  radians we are at the
point (0, 4) having finished one complete revolution.
The interval 0     yields one complete iteration of the circle.

3. Sketch a graph of the polar equation r  3sin( ) , and find an interval on which it
completes one cycle.
The last few examples have all been circles. Next we will consider two other “named”
polar equations, limaçons and roses.
Example 8
Sketch a graph of the polar equation r  4 sin( )  2 . What interval of θ values
corresponds to the inner loop?
This type of graph is called a limaçon.

472 Chapter 8
Using technology, we can draw a graph. The inner loop begins
and ends at the origin, where r = 0. We can solve for the θ
values for which r = 0.

function r  4 sin( )  2 takes on negative values.
Example 9
Sketch a graph of the polar equation r  cos(3 ) . What
interval of θ values describes one small loop of the graph?
This type of graph is called a 3 leaf rose.
Again we can use technology to produce a graph. The interval
[0, π) yields one cycle of this function. As with the last
problem, we can note that there is an interval on which one
loop of this graph begins and ends at the origin, where r = 0.

Converting Equations
While many polar equations cannot be expressed nicely in Cartesian form (and vice
versa), it can be beneficial to convert between the two forms, when possible. To do this
we use the same relationships we used to convert points between coordinate systems.
Example 10
Rewrite the Cartesian equation x 2  y 2  6 y as a polar equation.
We wish to eliminate x and y from the equation and introduce r and θ. Ideally, we
would like to write the equation with r isolated, if possible, which represents r as a
function of θ.
Remembering x 2  y 2  r 2 we substitute
x2  y2  6y
r 2  6y
y  r sin( ) and so we substitute again
Subtract 6r sin( ) from both sides
r 2  6r sin( )

r 2  6r sin( )  0
r r  6 sin( )  0
r  6 sin( ) or r = 0

Factor
Use the zero factor theorem
Since r = 0 is only a point, we reject that solution.

The solution r  6 sin( ) is fairly similar to the one we graphed in Example 7. In fact,
this equation describes a circle with bottom at the origin and top at the point (0, 6).

474 Chapter 8
Example 11
Rewrite the Cartesian equation y  3x  2 as a polar equation.
y  3x  2
r sin( )  3r cos( )  2
r sin( )  3r cos( )  2
r sin( )  3 cos( )  2
2
r
sin( )  3 cos( )

Use y  r sin( ) and x  r cos( )
Move all terms with r to one side
Factor out r
Divide

In this case, the polar equation is more unwieldy than the Cartesian equation, but there
are still times when this equation might be useful.
Example 12
Rewrite the polar equation r 

3
as a Cartesian equation.
1  2 cos( )

We want to eliminate θ and r and introduce x and y. It is usually easiest to start by
clearing the fraction and looking to substitute values that will eliminate θ.

When our entire equation has been changed from r and θ to x and y we can stop unless
asked to solve for y or simplify.
In this example, if desired, the right side of the equation could be expanded and the
equation simplified further. However, the equation cannot be written as a function in
Cartesian form.

Section 8.3 Polar Form of Complex Numbers
From previous classes, you may have encountered “imaginary numbers” – the square
roots of negative numbers – and, more generally, complex numbers which are the sum of
a real number and an imaginary number. While these are useful for expressing the
solutions to quadratic equations, they have much richer applications in electrical
engineering, signal analysis, and other fields. Most of these more advanced applications
rely on properties that arise from looking at complex numbers from the perspective of
polar coordinates.
We will begin with a review of the definition of complex numbers.
Imaginary Number i
The most basic complex number is i, defined to be i   1 , commonly called an
imaginary number. Any real multiple of i is also an imaginary number.
Example 1
Simplify  9 .
We can separate  9 as
square root of -1 as i.
 9 = 9  1  3i

9  1 . We can take the square root of 9, and write the

A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number.
Complex Number
A complex number is a number z  a  bi , where a and b are real numbers
a is the real part of the complex number
b is the imaginary part of the complex number
i  1
Plotting a complex number
We can plot real numbers on a number line. For example, if we wanted to show the
number 3, we plot a point:

Section 8.3 Polar Form of Complex Numbers 481
To plot a complex number like 3  4i , we need more than just a number line since there
are two components to the number. To plot this number, we need two number lines,
crossed to form a complex plane.
Complex Plane
In the complex plane, the horizontal axis is the real axis
and the vertical axis is the imaginary axis.

Example 2
Plot the number 3  4i on the complex plane.

imaginary
real

imaginary

The real part of this number is 3, and the imaginary part is -4.
To plot this, we draw a point 3 units to the right of the origin
in the horizontal direction and 4 units down in the vertical
direction.

real

Because this is analogous to the Cartesian coordinate system
for plotting points, we can think about plotting our complex
number z  a  bi as if we were plotting the point (a, b) in Cartesian coordinates.
Sometimes people write complex numbers as z  x  yi to highlight this relation.

Arithmetic on Complex Numbers
Before we dive into the more complicated uses of complex numbers, let’s make sure we
remember the basic arithmetic involved. To add or subtract complex numbers, we simply
add the like terms, combining the real parts and combining the imaginary parts.
Example 3
Add 3  4i and 2  5i .
Adding (3  4i)  (2  5i) , we add the real parts and the imaginary parts
3  2  4i  5i
5i
Try it Now
1. Subtract 2  5i from 3  4i .
We can also multiply and divide complex numbers.

482 Chapter 8
Example 4
Multiply: 4(2  5i) .
To multiply the complex number by a real number, we simply distribute as we would
when multiplying polynomials.
4(2  5i)
= 4  2  4  5i
 8  20i

Example 5
(2  5i )
Divide
.
(4  i )
To divide two complex numbers, we have to devise a way to write this as a complex
number with a real part and an imaginary part.
We start this process by eliminating the complex number in the denominator. To do
this, we multiply the numerator and denominator by a special complex number so that
the result in the denominator is a real number. The number we need to multiply by is
called the complex conjugate, in which the sign of the imaginary part is changed.
Here, 4+i is the complex conjugate of 4–i. Of course, obeying our algebraic rules, we
must multiply by 4+i on both the top and bottom.
(2  5i) (4  i)

(4  i) (4  i)
To multiply two complex numbers, we expand the product as we would with
polynomials (the process commonly called FOIL – “first outer inner last”). In the
numerator:
(2  5i)(4  i)

Expand

 8  20i  2i  5i 2
 8  20i  2i  5(1)
 3  22i

Since i   1 , i 2  1
Simplify

Following the same process to multiply the denominator
(4  i)(4  i)
Expand

(16  4i  4i  i 2 )
(16  (1))
=17
Combining this we get

Since i   1 , i 2  1

2. Multiply 3  4i and 2  3i .
With the interpretation of complex numbers as points in a plane, which can be related to
the Cartesian coordinate system, you might be starting to guess our next step – to refer to
this point not by its horizontal and vertical components, but using its polar location, given
by the distance from the origin and an angle.
Polar Form of Complex Numbers
Remember, because the complex plane is analogous to the Cartesian plane that we can
think of a complex number z  x  yi as analogous to the Cartesian point (x, y) and recall
how we converted from (x, y) to polar (r, θ) coordinates in the last section.
Bringing in all of our old rules we remember the following:

x
cos( ) 
r

sin( ) 

x  r cos( )
y  r sin( )

Note that the real part of this complex number is 0.
In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler demonstrated a relationship between exponential and
trigonometric functions that allows the use of complex numbers to greatly simplify some
trigonometric calculations. While the proof is beyond the scope of this class, you will
likely see it in a later calculus class.

484 Chapter 8
Polar Form of a Complex Number and Euler’s Formula
The polar form of a complex number is z  rei , where Euler’s Formula holds:

rei  r cos( )  ir sin( )
Similar to plotting a point in the polar coordinate system we need r and  to find the
polar form of a complex number.
Example 7
Find the polar form of the complex number -7.
Treating this is a complex number, we can consider the unsimplified version -7+0i.
Plotted in the complex plane, the number -7 is on the negative horizontal axis, a
distance of 7 from the origin at an angle of π from the positive horizontal axis.
The polar form of the number -7 is 7e i .
Plugging r = 7 and θ = π back into Euler’s formula, we have:
7e i  7 cos( )  7i sin( )  7  0i  7 as desired.
Example 8
Find the polar form of  4  4i .
On the complex plane, this complex number would correspond to the point (-4, 4) on a

The polar form of a complex number provides a powerful way to compute powers and
roots of complex numbers by using exponent rules you learned in algebra. To compute a
power of a complex number, we:
1) Convert to polar form
2) Raise to the power, using exponent rules to simplify
3) Convert back to a + bi form, if needed
Example 10

Evaluate  4  4i  .
While we could multiply this number by itself five times, that would be very tedious.
To compute this more efficiently, we can utilize the polar form of the complex number.

in polar form.

You may remember that equations like x 2  4 have two solutions, 2 and -2 in this case,
though the square root 4 only gives one of those solutions. Likewise, the square root
we found in Example 11 is only one of two complex numbers whose square is 9i.
Similarly, the equation z 3  8 would have three solutions where only one is given by the
cube root. In this case, however, only one of those solutions, z = 2, is a real value. To
find the others, we can use the fact that complex numbers have multiple representations
in polar form.
Example 12
Find all complex solutions to z 3  8 .

488 Chapter 8
Since we are trying to solve z 3  8 , we can solve for x as z  81/ 3 . Certainly one of
these solutions is the basic cube root, giving z = 2. To find others, we can turn to the
polar representation of 8.
Since 8 is a real number, is would sit in the complex plane on the horizontal axis at an
angle of 0, giving the polar form 8e 0i . Taking the 1/3 power of this gives the real
solution:

However, since the angle 2π is coterminal with the angle of 0, we could also represent
the number 8 as 8e 2i . Taking the 1/3 power of this gives a first complex solution:

Section 8.4 Vectors
A woman leaves home, walks 3 miles north, then 2 miles southeast. How far is she from
home, and in which direction would she need to walk to return home? How far has she
walked by the time she gets home?
This question may seem familiar – indeed we did a similar problem with a boat in the
first section of this chapter. In that section, we solved the problem using triangles. In
this section, we will investigate another way to approach the problem using vectors, a
geometric entity that indicates both a distance and a direction. We will begin our
investigation using a purely geometric view of vectors.
A Geometric View of Vectors
Vector
A vector is an object that has both a length and a direction.
Geometrically, a vector can be represented by an arrow that has a fixed length and
indicates a direction. If, starting at the point A, a vector, which means “carrier” in
Latin, moves toward point B, we write AB to represent the vector.
A vector may also be indicated using a single letter in boldface type, like u, or by

capping the letter representing the vector with an arrow, like u .
Example 1
Find a vector that represents the movement from the point P(-1, 2) to the point Q(3,3)
By drawing an arrow from the first point to the second,
we can construct a vector PQ .

Q
P

Using this geometric representation of vectors, we can visualize the addition and scaling
of vectors.
 
To add vectors, we envision a sum of two movements. To find u  v , we first draw the



vector u , then from the end of u we drawn the vector v . This corresponds to the notion
that first we move along the first vector, and then from that end position we move along
 
the second vector. The sum u  v is the new vector that travels directly from the


beginning of u to the end of v in a straight path.

492 Chapter 8
Adding Vectors Geometrically

To add vectors geometrically, draw v starting from the end of

 

u . The sum u  v is the vector from the beginning of u to the

end of v .

Notice that path of the walking woman from the beginning of the section could be
visualized as the sum of two vectors. The resulting sum vector would indicate her end
position relative to home.
Try it Now

1. Draw a vector, v , that travels from the origin to the point (3, 5).
Note that although vectors can exist anywhere in the plane, if we put the starting point at
the origin it is easy to understand its size and direction relative to other vectors.

  
To scale vectors by a constant, such as 3u , we can imagine adding u  u  u . The result
will be a vector three times as long in the same direction as the original vector. If we

were to scale a vector by a negative number, such as  u , we can envision this as the



opposite of u ; the vector so that u  (u ) returns us to the starting point. This vector


 u would point in the opposite direction as u but have the same length.

Another way to think about scaling a vector is to maintain its direction and multiply its

length by a constant, so that 3u would point in the same direction but will be 3 times as
long.

Section 8.4 Vectors 493
Scaling a Vector Geometrically
To geometrically scale a vector by a constant, scale the length of the vector by the
constant.
Scaling a vector by a negative constant will reverse the direction of the vector.
Example 3


Given the vector shown, draw 3u ,  u , and  2u .

and be twice as long.

By combining scaling and addition, we can find the difference between vectors

Component Form of Vectors
While the geometric interpretation of vectors gives us an intuitive understanding of
vectors, it does not provide us a convenient way to do calculations. For that, we need a
handy way to represent vectors. Since a vector involves a length and direction, it would
be logical to want to represent a vector using a length and an angle θ, usually measured
from standard position.

u
θ

Magnitude and Direction of a Vector


A vector u can be described by its magnitude, or length, u , and an angle θ.
A vector with length 1 is called unit vector.
While this is very reasonable, and a common way to describe vectors, it is often more
convenient for calculations to represent a vector by horizontal and vertical components.
Component Form of a Vector
The component form of a vector represents the vector using two components.

u  x, y indicates the vector represents a displacement of x units horizontally and y
units vertically.

u
θ
x

y

Notice how we can see the magnitude of the vector as the length of the hypotenuse of a
right triangle, or in polar form as the radius, r.
Alternate Notation for Vector Components


Sometimes you may see vectors written as the combination of unit vectors i and j ,




where i points the right and j points up. In other words, i  1,0 and j  0,1 .





In this notation, the vector u  3,4 would be written as u  3i  4 j since both
indicate a displacement of 3 units to the right, and 4 units down.


While it can be convenient to think of the vector u  x, y as an arrow from the origin to
the point (x, y), be sure to remember that most vectors can be situated anywhere in the
plane, and simply indicate a displacement (change in position) rather than a position.

Section 8.4 Vectors 495
It is common to need to convert from a magnitude and angle to the component form of
the vector and vice versa. Happily, this process is identical to converting from polar
coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, or from the polar form of complex numbers to the
a+bi form.
Example 5
Find the component form of a vector with length 7 at an angle of 135 degrees.
Using the conversion formulas x  r cos( ) and y  r sin( ) , we can find the
components

x  7 cos(135)  

First we can find the magnitude by remembering the relationship between x, y and r:

Second we can find the angle. Using the tangent,

3. Using vector v from Try it Now #1, the vector that travels from the origin to the
point (3, 5), find the components, magnitude and angle  that represent this vector.

496 Chapter 8
In addition to representing distance movements, vectors are commonly used in physics
and engineering to represent any quantity that has both direction and magnitude,
including velocities and forces.
Example 7
An object is launched with initial velocity 200 meters per second at an angle of 30
degrees. Find the initial horizontal and vertical velocities.
By viewing the initial velocity as a vector, we can resolve the vector into horizontal and
vertical components.

y  200 sin(30)  200   100 m/sec

This tells us that, absent wind resistance, the object will travel horizontally at about 173
meters each second. Gravity will cause the vertical velocity to change over time – we’ll
leave a discussion of that to physics or calculus classes.
Adding and Scaling Vectors in Component Form
To add vectors in component form, we can simply add the corresponding components.
To scale a vector by a constant, we scale each component by that constant.

Section 8.4 Vectors 497
By representing vectors in component form, we can find the resulting displacement
vector after a multitude of movements without needing to draw a lot of complicated nonright triangles. For a simple example, we revisit the problem from the opening of the
section. The general procedure we will follow is:
1) Convert vectors to component form
2) Add the components of the vectors
3) Convert back to length and direction if needed to suit the context of the question
Example 9
A woman leaves home, walks 3 miles north, then 2 miles southeast. How far is she
from home, and what direction would she need to walk to return home? How far has
she walked by the time she gets home?
Let’s begin by understanding the question in a little more depth.
When we use vectors to describe a traveling direction, we often
position things so north points in the upward direction, east
points to the right, and so on, as pictured here.
Consequently, travelling NW, SW, NE or SE, means we are
travelling through the quadrant bordered by the given directions
at a 45 degree angle.

NW

N

NE
E

W
SW

SE

S

With this in mind, we begin by converting each vector to components.
A walk 3 miles north would, in components, be 0,3 .
A walk of 2 miles southeast would be at an angle of 45° South of East, or measuring
from standard position the angle would be 315°.
Converting to components, we choose to use the standard position angle so that we do
not have to worry about whether the signs are negative or positive; they will work out
automatically.

 2
, 2

Adding these vectors gives the sum of the movements in component
form
0,3  1.414,1.414  1.414,1.586

To find how far she is from home and the direction she would need to walk to return
home, we could find the magnitude and angle of this vector.
Length = 1.414 2  1.586 2  2.125

498 Chapter 8
To find the angle, we can use the tangent
1.586
tan( ) 
1.414
 1.586 
  tan 1 
  48.273 north of east
 1.414 
Of course, this is the angle from her starting point to her ending point. To return home,
she would need to head the opposite direction, which we could either describe as
180°+48.273° = 228.273° measured in standard position, or as 48.273° south of west (or
41.727° west of south).
She has walked a total distance of 3 + 2 + 2.125 = 7.125 miles.
Keep in mind that total distance travelled is not the same as the length of the resulting
displacement vector or the “return” vector.
Try it Now
4. In a scavenger hunt, directions are given to find a buried treasure. From a starting
point at a flag pole you must walk 30 feet east, turn 30 degrees to the north and
travel 50 feet, and then turn due south and travel 75 feet. Sketch a picture of these
vectors, find their components, and calculate how far and in what direction you
must travel to go directly to the treasure from the flag pole without following the
map.
While using vectors is not much faster than using law of cosines with only two
movements, when combining three or more movements, forces, or other vector
quantities, using vectors quickly becomes much more efficient than trying to use
triangles.

Three forces are acting on an object as shown below, each measured in Newtons (N).
What force must be exerted to keep the object in equilibrium (where the sum of the
forces is zero)?

We start by resolving each vector into components.

Section 8.4 Vectors 499
The first vector with magnitude 6 Newtons at an angle of 30 degrees will have
components
6 cos(30), 6 sin(30)  6 

The second vector is only in the horizontal direction, so can be written as  7, 0 .
The third vector with magnitude 4 Newtons at an angle of 300 degrees will have
components

 3
4 cos(300), 4 sin(300)  4  , 4 
 2,  2 3

To keep the object in equilibrium, we need to find a force vector x, y so the sum of
the four vectors is the zero vector, 0,0 .

3 3, 3  7, 0  2,  2 3  x, y  0, 0

Add component-wise

3 3  7  2, 3  0  2 3  x, y  0, 0

Simplify

3 3  5, 3  2 3  x, y  0, 0

Solve

x, y  0, 0  3 3  5, 3  2 3
x, y  3 3  5,  3  2 3  0.196, 0.464
This vector gives in components the force that would need to be applied to keep the
object in equilibrium. If desired, we could find the magnitude of this force and
direction it would need to be applied in.
Magnitude = (0.196) 2  0.464 2  0.504 N
Angle:

 0.196
 0.464 
  tan 1 
  67.089 .
  0.196 
This is in the wrong quadrant, so we adjust by finding the next angle with the same
tangent value by adding a full period of tangent:
  67.089  180  112.911
To keep the object in equilibrium, a force of 0.504 Newtons would need to be applied at
an angle of 112.911°.

Section 8.5 Parametric Equations
Many shapes, even ones as simple as circles, cannot be represented as an equation where
y is a function of x. Consider, for example, the path a moon follows as it orbits around a
planet, which simultaneously rotates around a sun. In some cases, polar equations
provide a way to represent such a path. In others, we need a more versatile approach that
allows us to represent both the x and y coordinates in terms of a third variable, or
parameter.
Parametric Equations
A system of parametric equations is a pair of functions x(t) and y(t) in which the x and
y coordinates are the output, represented in terms of a third input parameter, t.
Example 1
Moving at a constant speed, an object moves at a steady rate along a straight path from
coordinates (-5, 3) to the coordinates (3, -1) in 4 seconds, where the coordinates are
measured in meters. Find parametric equations for the position of the object.
The x coordinate of the object starts at -5 meters, and goes to +3 meters, this means the
x direction has changed by 8 meters in 4 seconds, giving us a rate of 2 meters per
second. We can now write the x coordinate as a linear function with respect to time, t,
x(t )  5  2t . Similarly, the y value starts at 3 and goes to -1, giving a change in y
value of 4 meters, meaning the y values have decreased by
4 meters in 4 seconds, for a rate of -1 meter per second,
t
x
y
giving equation y(t )  3  t . Together, these are the
0

parametric equations for the position of the object:

x(t )  5  2t
2
-1
1
3

0
y (t )  3  t
4

-1
Using these equations, we can build a table of t, x, and y
values. Because of the context, we limited ourselves to non-negative t values for this
example, but in general you can use any values.
From this table, we could create three possible graphs: a graph of x vs. t, which would
show the horizontal position over time, a graph of y vs. t, which would show the vertical
position over time, or a graph of y vs. x, showing the position of the object in the plane.

Section 8.5 Parametric Equations 505

Notice that the parameter t does not explicitly show up in this third graph. Sometimes,
when the parameter t does represent a quantity like time, we might indicate the direction
of movement on the graph using an arrow, as shown above.
There is often no single parametric representation for a curve.
In Example 1 we assumed the object was moving at a steady
rate along a straight line. If we kept the assumption about the
path (straight line) but did not assume the speed was constant,
we might get a system like:
x(t )  5  2t 2

x(t)

y(t)

t

y (t )  3  t 2
This starts at (-5, 3) when t = 0 and ends up at
(3, -1) when t = 2. If we graph the x(t) and y(t)
function separately, we can see that those are
no longer linear, but if we graph x vs. y we will
see that we still get a straight-line path.

Example 2
Sketch a graph of
x(t )  t 2  1
y (t )  2  t
We can begin by creating a table of values. From this table, we
can plot the (x, y) points in the plane, sketch in a rough graph of
the curve, and indicate the direction of motion with respect to
time by using arrows.

Notice that here the parametric equations describe a shape for which y is not a function of
x. This is an example of why using parametric equations can be useful – since they can
represent such a graph as a set of functions. This particular graph also appears to be a
parabola where x is a function of y, which we will soon verify.
While creating a t-x-y table, plotting points and connecting the dots with a smooth curve
usually works to give us a rough idea of what the graph of a system of parametric
equations looks like, it's generally easier to use technology to create these tables and
(simultaneously) much nicer-looking graphs.
Example 3
Sketch a graph of

x(t )  2 cos(t )
.
y (t )  3 sin(t )

y

Using technology we can generate a graph of this
equation, producing an ellipse.
x
Similar to graphing polar equations, you must change the
MODE on your calculator (or select parametric equations
on your graphing technology) before graphing a system
of parametric equations. You will know you have
successfully entered parametric mode when the equation
input has changed to ask for a x(t)= and y(t)= pair of equations.

Converting from Parametric to Cartesian
In some cases, it is possible to eliminate the parameter t, allowing you to write a pair of
parametric equations as a Cartesian equation.
It is easiest to do this if one of the x(t) or y(t) functions can easily be solved for t,
allowing you to then substitute the remaining expression into the second part.

7

508 Chapter 8
Example 6
x(t )  t 2  1
Write
as a Cartesian equation, if possible.
y (t )  2  t
Here, the equation for y is linear, so is relatively easy to solve for t. Since the resulting
Cartesian equation will likely not be a function, and for convenience, we drop the
function notation.
Solve for t
y  2t
Substitute this for t in the x equation
y2t

x  ( y  2) 2  1
Notice that this is the equation of a parabola with x as a function of y, with vertex at
(1,2), opening to the right. Comparing this with the graph from Example 2, we see
(unsurprisingly) that it yields the same graph in the x-y plane as did the original
parametric equations.

2. Write

x(t )  t 3
y (t )  t 6

as a Cartesian equation, if possible.

Example 7
x(t )  t  2
Write

y (t )  log( t )
We could solve either the first or second equation for t. Solving the first,
x  t 2
x2 t
Square both sides

 x  2  t
Substitute into the y equation



y  log x  2



Since the parametric equation is only defined for t  0 , this Cartesian equation is
equivalent to the parametric equation on the corresponding domain. The parametric
equations show that when t > 0, x > 2 and y > 0, so the domain of the Cartesian equation
should be limited to x > 2.
To ensure that the Cartesian equation is as equivalent as possible to the original
parametric equation, we try to avoid using domain-restricted inverse functions, such as
the inverse trig functions, when possible. For equations involving trig functions, we
often try to find an identity to utilize to avoid the inverse functions.

Section 8.5 Parametric Equations 509
Example 8
x(t )  2 cos(t )
Write
as a Cartesian equation, if possible.
y (t )  3 sin(t )

This is a Cartesian equation for the ellipse we graphed earlier.
Parameterizing Curves
While converting from parametric form to Cartesian can be useful, it is often more useful
to parameterize a Cartesian equation – converting it into parametric form.
If the Cartesian equation gives one variable as a function of the other, then
parameterization is trivial – the independent variable in the function can simply be
defined as t.
Example 9
Parameterize the equation x  y 3  2 y .
In this equation, x is expressed as a function of y. By defining y  t we can then
substitute that into the Cartesian equation, yielding x  t 3  2t . Together, this produces
the parametric form:
x(t )  t 3  2t
y (t )  t

Try it Now
3. Write x 2  y 2  3 in parametric form, if possible.

510 Chapter 8
In addition to parameterizing Cartesian equations, we also can parameterize behaviors
and movements.
Example 10
A robot follows the path shown. Create a table of values for
the x(t) and y(t) functions, assuming the robot takes one
second to make each movement.
Since we know the direction of motion, we can introduce
consecutive values for t along the path of the robot. Using
these values with the x and y coordinates of the robot, we
can create the tables. For example, we designate the
starting point, at (1, 1), as the position at t = 0, the next
point at (3, 1) as the position at t = 1, and so on.

Notice how this also ties back to vectors. The journey of the robot as it moves through
the Cartesian plane could also be displayed as vectors and total distance traveled and
displacement could be calculated.
Example 11
A light is placed on the edge of a bicycle tire as shown and the bicycle starts rolling
down the street. Find a parametric equation for the position of the light after the wheel
has rotated through an angle of θ.

θ

r
Starting

Rotated by θ

Relative to the center of the wheel, the position of the light can be found as the
coordinates of a point on a circle, but since the x coordinate begins at 0 and moves in
the negative direction, while the y coordinate starts at the lowest value, the coordinates
of the point will be given by:
x  r sin( )
y  r cos( )

Section 8.5 Parametric Equations 511
The center of the wheel, meanwhile, is moving horizontally. It remains at a constant
height of r, but the horizontal position will move a distance equivalent to the arclength
of the circle drawn out by the angle, s  r . The position of the center of the circle is
then
x  r
yr
Combining the position of the center of the wheel with the position of the light on the
wheel relative to the center, we get the following parametric equationw, with θ as the
parameter:
x  r  r sin( )  r   sin( ) 
y  r  r cos( )  r 1  cos( ) 
The result graph is called a cycloid.

Example 12
A moon travels around a planet
as shown, orbiting once every 10
days. The planet travels around
a sun as shown, orbiting once
every 100 days. Find a
parametric equation for the
position of the moon, relative to
the center of the sun, after t days.
For this example, we’ll assume
the orbits are circular, though in
real life they’re actually
elliptical.
The coordinates of a point on a
circle can always be written in
the form
x  r cos( )
y  r sin( )

41. An object is thrown in the air with vertical velocity 20 ft/s and horizontal velocity 15
ft/s. The object’s height can be described by the equation y  t   16t 2  20t , while
the object moves horizontally with constant velocity 15 ft/s. Write parametric
equations for the object’s position, then eliminate time to write height as a function of
horizontal position.
42. A skateboarder riding on a level surface at a constant speed of 9 ft/s throws a ball in
the air, the height of which can be described by the equation y  t   16t 2  10t  5 .
Write parametric equations for the ball’s position, then eliminate time to write height
as a function of horizontal position.

43. A carnival ride has a large rotating arm with
diameter 40 feet centered 35 feet off the ground.
At each end of the large arm are two smaller
rotating arms with diameter 16 feet each. The
larger arm rotates once every 5 seconds, while the
smaller arms rotate once every 2 seconds. If you
board the ride when the point P is closest to the
ground, find parametric equations for your
position over time.
44. A hypocycloid is a shape generated by tracking a fixed
point on a small circle as it rolls around the inside of a
larger circle. If the smaller circle has radius 1 and the
large circle has radius 6, find parametric equations for
the position of the point P as the smaller wheel rolls in
the direction indicated.
