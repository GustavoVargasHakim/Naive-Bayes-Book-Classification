Algebra Review
This College Algebra text will cover a combination of classical algebra and analytic geometry, with an introduction to the transcendental exponential and logarithmic functions. If mathematics is the language of science, then algebra is the
grammar of that language. Like grammar, algebra provides a structure to mathematical notation, in addition to its uses in problem solving and its ability to
change the appearance of an expression without changing the value.

1.1

Algebraic Simplification

When algebraic techniques are presented as skills in isolation, they are much simpler to understand and practice. However the problem solving process in any
context involves deciding which skills to use when. Most College Algebra students will have practiced problems in the form:
(x + 7)(x − 2) =?
or
(2x + 1)2 =?
The problems in this section deal with a combination of these processes which
are often encountered as parts of more complex problems.

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

Examples
Simplify:

3(x − 1)(2x + 5) − (x + 4)2
In this example, the simplification involves two expressions: 3(x − 1)(2x + 5) and
(x + 4)2 . The (x + 4)2 is preceded by a negative (or subtraction) sign. This textbook will often treat −x and +(−x) as equivalent statements, since subtraction is
defined as the addition of a negative.
We will simplify each expression separately and then look to combine like terms.
3(x − 1)(2x + 5) − (x + 4)2 = 3(2x2 + 3x − 5) − (x2 + 8x + 16)
Notice that the results of both multiplications remain inside of parentheses. This
is because each one has something that must be distributed.
In the case of (2x2 + 3x − 5), there is a 3 which must be distributed, resulting in
6x2 + 9x − 15. In the case of (x2 + 8x + 16) there is a negative sign or −1 which
must be distributed, resulting in −x2 − 8x − 16. It is important in these situations
that the negative sign be distributed to all terms in the parentheses.
So:
3(x − 1)(2x + 5) − (x + 4)2 = 3(2x2 + 3x − 5) − (x2 + 8x + 16)
= 6x2 + 9x − 15 − x2 − 8x − 16
= 5x2 + x − 31
Simplify:

2(x + 3)2 − 4(3x − 1)(x + 2)
This example shows some of the same processes as the previous example. There
are again two expressions that must be simplified, each of which has a coefficient
that must be distributed. It is often helpful to wait until after multiplying the
binomials before distributing the coefficient. However, as is often true in math-

1.1. ALGEBRAIC SIMPLIFICATION

7

ematics, there are several different approaches that may be taken in simplifying
this problem.
If someone prefers to first distribute the coefficient before multiplying the binomials, then the coefficient must only be distributed to ONE of the binomials, but
not both. For example, in multiplying 3∗2∗5 = 30, we can first multiply 2∗5 = 10
and then 3 ∗ 10 = 30. Each factor is multiplied only once.
In the example above we can proceed as we did with the previous example:

2(x + 3)2 − 4(3x − 1)(x + 2) = 2(x2 + 6x + 9) − 4(3x2 + 5x − 2)
= 2x2 + 12x + 18 − 12x2 − 20x + 8
= −10x2 − 8x + 26

Or, we can choose to distribute the 4 first:

2(x + 3)2 − 4(3x − 1)(x + 2) = 2(x2 + 6x + 9) − (12x − 4)(x + 2)
= 2x2 + 12x + 18 − (12x2 + 20x − 8)
= 2x2 + 12x + 18 − 12x2 − 20x + 8
= −10x2 − 8x + 26

Or, we can distribute the 4 as a negative. If we do this, then the sign in front of
the parentheses will be positive:

2(x + 3)2 − 4(3x − 1)(x + 2) = 2(x2 + 6x + 9) + (−12x + 4)(x + 2)
= 2x2 + 12x + 18 + (−12x2 − 20x + 8)
= −10x2 − 8x + 26

Distributing the 2 in front of the squared binomial must also be handled carefully
if you choose to do this. If you distribute the 2 before squaring the (x + 3), then
the 2 will be squared as well. If you choose to distribute the 2, the (x + 3)2 must
be written out as (x + 3)(x + 3):

8

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW
2(x + 3)2 − 4(3x − 1)(x + 2) = 2(x + 3)(x + 3) − 4(3x − 1)(x + 2)
= (2x + 6)(x + 3) − 4(3x2 + 5x − 2)
= 2x2 + 12x + 18 − 12x2 − 20x + 8
= −10x2 − 8x + 26

Most examples in this text will distribute the coefficients as the last step before
combining like terms for a final answer.

Simplify:

3x[5 − (2x + 7)] + (3x − 2)2 − (x − 5)(x + 4)

This example has three expressions that should be simplified separately before
combining like terms. In the first expression 3x[5 − (2x + 7)], we should simplify
inside the brackets before distributing the 3x.
3x[5 − (2x + 7)] + (3x − 2)2 − (x − 5)(x + 4)
= 3x[5 − 2x − 7] + (3x − 2)2 − (x − 5)(x + 4)
= 3x[−2x − 2] + (3x − 2)(3x − 2) − (x2 − x − 20)
= −6x2 − 6x + (9x2 − 12x + 4) − x2 + x + 20
= −6x2 − 6x + 9x2 − 12x + 4 − x2 + x + 20
= 2x2 − 17x + 24

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

Factoring

This section will review three of the most common types of factoring - factoring
out a Greatest Common Factor, Trinomial Factoring and factoring a Difference of
Squares.

Greatest Common Factor
Factoring out a greatest common factor essentially undoes the distributive multiplication that often occurs in mathematical expressions. This factor may be monomial or polynomial, but in these examples, we will explore monomial common
factors.
In multiplying 3xy 2 (5x−2y) = 15x2 y 2 −6xy 3 the monomial term 3xy 2 is multiplied
or distributed to both terms inside the parentheses. The process of factorization
undoes this multiplication.

Example:

Factor 7x2 + 14x

This expression has two terms. The coefficients share a common factor of 7 and
the only variable involved in this expression is x. The highest power of the variable that is shared by both terms is x1 , so this is the power of x that can be factored
out of both terms. The greatest common factor is 7x.
7x2 + 14x = 7x(x + 2)
It isn’t necessary to find the greatest common factor right away. In more complicated problems, the factoring can be accomplished in pieces, similar in fashion to
reducing fractions.

1.2. FACTORING

11

Example:

Factor 42x2 y 6 + 98xy 3 − 210x3 y 2

This expression has three terms. It’s not immediately clear what the greatest
common factor of the coefficients is, but they’re all even numbers, so we could at
least divide them all by 2. The 98xy 3 term has an x1 , which means that this is the
hightest power of x that we could factor out of all the terms. The 210x3 y 2 has a
y 2 , which is the highest power of y that can be factored out of all the terms. So we
can at least proceed with these factors:
42x2 y 6 + 98xy 3 − 210x3 y 2 = 2xy 2 ∗ 21xy 4 + 2xy 2 ∗ 49y − 2xy 2 ∗ 105x2
= 2xy 2 (21xy 4 + 49y − 105x2 )
Now, we didn’t try very hard to find the greatest common factor in the beginning
of this problem, so it’s important that we continue to question whether or not
there are any remaining common factors. The 21 and 49 clearly share a common
factor of 7, so it would make sense to see if 105 is divisible by 7 as well. If we
divide 105 by 7, we see that 105 = 7*15. So, we can also factor out a common
factor of 7 from the remaining terms in the parentheses.
2xy 2 (21xy 4 + 49y − 105x2 ) = 2xy 2 (7 ∗ 3xy 4 + 7 ∗ 7y − 7 ∗ 15x2 )
= 7 ∗ 2xy 2 (3xy 4 + 7y − 15x2 )
= 14xy 2 (3xy 4 + 7y − 15x2 )

12

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

Trinomial Factoring (a = 1)
Trinomial factoring undoes the multiplication of two binomials, and it comes in
two flavors - simple and complex. The simplest form of trinomial factoring involves a trinomial expression in the form ax2 + bx + c in which the value of a is 1.
This makes the task of factorization simpler than if the value of a is not 1.

Example

Factor x2 + 7x + 10

In this example, the value of a is 1, which makes this type of trinomial factoring
a little less difficult that it would otherwise be. Whether or not the value of a is 1,
the fundamental issue that governs this type of factoring is the + or − sign of the
constant term. In this problem, the constant term is positive. That means that we
need to find factors of 10 that add up to 7. This is relatively straightforward:
x2 + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)
A companion problem to this one is x2 − 7x + 10. Notice that, in this case, the
sign of the constant term is still positive, which means that we still need factors
of 10 that add up to 7. This means we still need to use 2 and 5. However, in
this case, instead of the +10 being produced from a multiplication of (+2)(+5),
it is the result of multiplying (−2)(−5). This is what makes the 7 in the second
example negative:
x2 − 7x + 10 = (x − 2)(x − 5)
Example

Factor x2 + 3x − 10

In this case, the sign of the constant term is negative. That means that we need to
find factors of 10 that have a difference of 3. This is still 5 and 2.

1.2. FACTORING

13
x2 + 3x − 10 = (x − 2)(x + 5)

The multiplication of the (−2) and the (+5) produce the (−10) and the fact that
the 2 and 5 have opposite signs creates the difference that gives us (+3). A companion problem to this one is x2 − 3x − 10. In this case, the sign of the constant
term is still negative, which means that we still need factors of 10 that have a
difference of 3. This means we still need to use 2 and 5. However in this case,
instead of the (+3) as the coefficient of the middle term, we’ll need a (−3). To do
this we simply reverse the signs of the 2 and 5 from the previous problem:
x2 − 3x − 10 = (x + 2)(x − 5)
Now the (+2)(−5) gives us (−10), but the +2x − 5x gives us (−3x) instead of
(+3x).
Example
Factor x2 + 11x − 42

In this problem, the sign of the constant term is negative. That means that we
need factors of 42 that have a difference of 11. A systematic exploration of all the
factor pairs of 42 can help us to find the correct pair:

1

42

14

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

Here, we can see that the factors 3 and 14 have a difference of 11. This means that
we will use these factors in our answer: (x
3)(x
14). In determining how
to place the + and − signs in the parentheses, we can refer back to the original
problem: x2 + 11x − 42. If we want a difference of (+11x), then we’ll need to have
a (+14) and a (−3):
x2 + 11x − 42 = (x − 3)(x + 14)
Example
Factor x2 + 28x + 96

In this problem, the sign of the constant term is positive. That means that we
need factors of 96 that add up to 28. A systematic exploration of all the factor
pairs of 96 can help us to find the correct pair:

1

96

2

48

3

32

4

24

6

16

8

12

Here, we can see that the factors 4 and 24 add up to 28. This means that we will
use these factors in our answer: (x
4)(x
24). In determining how to place
the + and − signs in the parentheses, we can refer back to the original problem:
x2 + 28x + 96. If we want 4 and 24 to add up to (+28), then they should both be
positive:
x2 + 28x + 96 = (x + 4)(x + 24)

1.2. FACTORING

15

In building the charts of factor pairs in the previous two problems, nothing more
difficult than dividing the constant term by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... and so
on can help you to find the full list of factor pairs. If you don’t get a whole number when dividing - for instance 96 ÷ 5 = 19.2, then this number is not included
in the list of factor pairs.

Trinomial Factoring (a 6= 1)
If the value of a is not 1, this means that, if the trinomial is factorable, at least one
of its binomial factors also has a coefficient other than 1. For instance:
(2x + 7)(x − 3) = 2x2 + 1x − 21
If we were to try undo this multiplication through the process of trinomial factoring, we should look to the sign of the constant term. In this example, the sign
is negative. This still means that we will need to find factor pairs that produce
a difference of (+1x) as the middle term. However, in this scenario, it is not just
the factors of 21 that are involved in producing the (+1x), but the combination
of the factors of 21 and the factors of the leading coefficient 2. The middle term
(+1x) comes from the multiplication of the (2x)(−3) and the multiplication of
(+7)(+1x):
(2x + 7)(x − 3)

(2x + 7)(x − 3) = 2x2 − 6x + 7x − 21
= 2x2 + x − 21
In trying to factor a trinomial like 2x2 + x − 21, we need to take this into consideration. For example, if we were to factor 3x2 − 10x + 8, we should first still look
to the sign of the constant term, which, in this case, is positive. That means we
want factor pairs that will add up to 10. But we have to take into consideration
the interaction of the factors of the 3 with the factors of the 8. The 3 is a prime
number, which means that we don’t have a choice - it can only be split up into
3 ∗ 1, so we can start:
Factor 3x2 + 10x + 8

16

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW
(3x

?)(x

?)

Our options for filling in the question marks will come from the factors of 8, either
8 ∗ 1 or 4 ∗ 2. The process is by trial and error:
(3x

8)(x

1)

(3x

3x + 8x = 11x

(3x

4)(x

1)(x

8)

24x + 1x = 25x

2)

(3x

6x + 4x = 10x

2)(x

4)

12x + 2x = 14x

We can see that the choice above:
(3x

4)(x

2)

gives us the required 10x as the middle term. Since the original problem was
3x2 + 10x + 8 we’ll want to fill in the signs as both positive:
3x2 + 10x + 8 = (3x + 4)(x + 2)

A second method for handling this type of factoring depends on how the factors
of the leading coefficient and constant term interact with each other to produce
the middle term. In this process, given the problem 3x2 + 10 + 8, we can multiply
the first and last coefficient and then look at the factor pairs of the product:
3 ∗ 8 = 24

1.2. FACTORING

17

24

12

3

6

We can see that the factor pair of 24 that adds up to 10 is 6 ∗ 4. We proceed by
splitting the 10x into 6x + 4x and then factor by grouping. If you are uncomfortable with factoring by grouping, then this is probably not a good method to
try. However, if you are comfortable with factoring by grouping, the rest of the
process is relatively straightforward:
3x2 + 10x + 8 = 3x2 + 6x + 4x + 8
We then factor a common factor from the first two terms and the last two terms
separately, and then factor out the common binomial factor of (x + 2):
3x2 + 10x + 8 = 3x2 + 6x + 4x + 8
= 3x(x + 2) + 4(x + 2)
= (x + 2)(3x + 4)
Example

Factor 7x2 − 5x − 18

In this example, the sign of the constant term is negative, which means that we’ll
need factor pairs that produce a difference of 5. The leading coefficient is 7, which
is prime, so, again, the only way to split up the 7 is 7 ∗ 1.
(7x

?)(x

?)

The options for filling in the question marks come from the factors of 18, for

18

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

which there are three possibilities: 18 ∗ 1, 9 ∗ 2, or 6 ∗ 3. We’ll try each of these
factor pairs in place of the question marks:
(7x

18)(x

1)

(7x

1)(x

18)

18x − 7x = 11x

126x − 1x = 125x

(7x

(7x

9)(x

2)

14x − 9x = 5x

(7x

6)(x

2)(x

9)

63x − 2x = 61x

3)

(7x

21x − 6x = 15x

3)(x

6)

42x − 3x = 39x

The choice above:
(7x

9)(x

2)

gives us the required 5x as the middle term. Since we’re looking for a (−5x), we’ll
make the 14 negative and the 9 positive: −14x + 9x = −5x.
7x2 − 5x − 18 = (7x + 9)(x − 2)

1.2. FACTORING

19

If we want to try the other method for factoring 7x2 − 5x − 18, we would multiply
7 ∗ 18 = 126, and then work to find factor pairs of 126 that have a difference of 5:

1

126

2

63

3

42

6

21

7

18

9

14

Here, the last factor pair, 9 ∗ 14, has a difference of 5. So then we proceed to factor
by grouping:
7x2 − 5x − 18 = 7x2 + 9x − 14x − 18
= x(7x + 9) − 2(7x + 9)
= (7x + 9)(x − 2)
Notice that when the −2 was factored out from the last two terms −14x − 18, we
ended up with −2(7x + 9), because (−2) ∗ (+9) = −18. This is also important because in order to factor out the common binomial factor of (7x + 9), this binomial
must be exactly the same in both terms.

20

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

Difference of Squares
Factoring a difference of squares is actually a special form of trinomial factoring.
If we consider a trinomial of the form ax2 + bx + c, where c is a perfect square and
negative, we will find something interesting about the possible values of b that
make the trinomial factorable.

Example
Consider x2 + bx − 36
For this expression to be factorable, the middle coefficient b would need to be
equal to the difference of any of the factor pairs of 36. If we look at the possible
factor pairs, we see the following:

1

36

2

18

3

12

4

This means that the possible values for b that would make this expression factorable are:
36 − 1 = 35 → x2 + 35x − 36 = (x + 36)(x − 1)
18 − 2 = 16 → x2 + 16x − 36 = (x + 18)(x − 2)
12 − 3 = 9 → x2 + 9x − 36 = (x + 12)(x − 3)
9 − 4 = 5 → x2 + 5x − 36 = (x + 9)(x − 4)
6 − 6 = 0 → x2 + 0x − 36 = x2 − 36 = (x + 6)(x − 6)

1.2. FACTORING

21

As we see, factoring x2 − 36 means that the factors of the perfect square 36 = 6 ∗ 6
will cancel each other out leaving 0x in the middle. If there is a perfect square as
the leading coefficient, then this number should be square rooted as well:
16x2 − 25 = (4x + 5)(4x − 5)
In the example above, the +20x and −20x as the middle terms cancel each other
out leaving just 16x2 − 25.
These three types of factoring can also be combined with each other as we see in
the following examples.
Example
Factor 2x2 − 50
This is not a trinomial because it doesn’t have three terms. It is also not a difference of squares because 2 and 50 are not perfect squares. However, there is a
common factor of 2 which we can factor out:
2x2 − 50 = 2(x2 − 25)
The expression inside the parentheses is a difference of squares and should be
factored:
2x2 − 50 = 2(x2 − 25) = 2(x + 5)(x − 5)
Example
Factor 24 − 2x − x2
Here the sign of the x2 term is negative. For this problem we can factor out
a −1 and proceed as we did with the previous problems in which the leading
coefficient was positive or we can factor it as it is:
24 − 2x − x2 = −(x2 + 2x − 24) = −(x + 6)(x − 4)

22

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

If we want to factor it as it is, we should be aware that the constant term is positive
and the quadratic term is negative, which means that we will want the factors of
24 to have a difference of 2.
24 − 2x − x2 = (6 + x)(4 − x)
Example
Factor 6x2 + 12x + 6
First, we notice that this expression has a common factor of 6. If we factor out the
6, then we should be left with an easier problem:
6x2 + 12x + 6 = 6(x2 + 2x + 1) = 6(x + 1)(x + 1) = 6(x + 1)2

Quadratic Equations

Quadratic equations are equations of the second degree. The solution of quadratic
equations has a long history in mathematics going back several thousand years
to the geometric solutions produced by the Babylonian culture. The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta used ”rhetorical algebra” (algebra written out in words)
in the 7th century to produce solutions to quadratic equations and Arab mathematicians of 9th and 10th centuries followed simlar methods. Leonardo of Pisa,
also known as Fibonacci included information on the Arab approach to solving
quadratic equations in his book Liber Abaci, published in 1202.
The quadratic formula is generally used to solve quadratic equations in standard
form: ax2 + bx + c = 0. The solutions for this are:
√
−b ± b2 − 4ac
x=
2a
Now, the question is - why does this formula give solutions to the standard
quadratic equation? We can proceed as we normally do in solving linear equations - that is, by getting the x by itself. The only problem here is that instead of
just x, there are also terms involving x2 . This is where the process of completing
the square comes in handy.
We can begin with the quadratic equation in standard form:
ax2 + bx + c = 0
Just as it is easier to factor a quadratic trinomial if the leading coefficient is 1, this
process of completing the square is also easier if the leading coefficient is 1. So,
next we will divide through on both sides of this equation by a.

Now we need to complete the square. If you are already familiar with this process, you may wish to skip the following explanation.
If we look at what happens when we square a binomial like (x+3)2 , we will begin
to notice a pattern.
(x + 3)2 = (x + 3)(x + 3) = x2 + 6x + 9
(x + 4)2 = (x + 4)(x + 4) = x2 + 8x + 16
(x + 5)2 = (x + 5)(x + 5) = x2 + 10x + 25
(x + 6)2 = (x + 6)(x + 6) = x2 + 12x + 36
Our goal in the derivation of the Quadratic Formula is to rewrite the expression
)2 . The reason that we want to do
x2 + ab x as a perfect square in the form (x+
this is that writing an expression as a binomial squared eliminates the problem of
having both an x and an x2 , which was preventing us from getting the x by itself
in the standard quadratic equation.
If we can figure out what should take the place of the blanks in the statement:
x2 + ab x+

= (x+

)2

then we will be well on our way to deriving the quadratic formula.

1.3. QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

27

If we re-examine the sample perfect binomial squares from the previous page, we
note a useful pattern. This is that the blank in the parentheses (x+
)2 is filled
by a number that is one-half the value of the linear coefficient - or the coefficient
of the x1 term. Notice that in x2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)2 , 3 is half of 6, in x2 + 8x + 16 =
as a perfect
(x + 4)2 , the 4 is half of 8, and so on. If we want to write x2 + ab x+
2
square in the form (x+
) , the blank in the parentheses should be filled by:

b
Now, it’s not true that x2 + x+
a

1 b


2
b

2a

We’re missing the constant term on the left. However, if we return to our perfect
square examples, we can see that the constant term is always the square of the
term inside inside the parentheses. So, we can restate our problem now as:

b
x + x+

At the college algebra level, it is often useful to program the quadratic formula
onto a graphing calculator both for easy use and also to learn a little bit about
programming. The following program is a simple example of this for the TI84 series of graphing calculators. Graphing calculators also often have built-in
polynomial solver feature that can be used to solve quadratics.
Press the ”prgm” key in the top middle of the calculator keypad. This will bring
up a screen that shows EXEC
EDIT
NEW across the top. Arrow over across
the top to ”NEW,” and then select 1: Create New.
This will bring up a screen asking you to name the program. You should see
PROGRAM and then underneath it, ”Name=”. The alpha lock is on automatically, so any key you press will type the letter associated with it. Name your
program and press ENTER. You should see PROGRAM: Name, with whatever
name you’ve chosen for your program. Underneath this you will se a colon :.
This is where you will enter the commands for the program.
First we need to enter the values for A, B and C from the quadratic equation into
the calculator. To do this, press the ”prgm” key again. Across the top of the screen
you should see CTL
I/O
COLOR
EXEC.
Arrow over to I/O. This is the ”input/output” menu. Choose number 2:Prompt.
This will return you to the program screen where you will see :Prompt under the
name of the program. After :Prompt, type A, B, C. You’ll need to use the ”alpha”
key to access the letters and the comma is right above the 7 key.

30

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

PROGRAM: Name (whatever name you’ve chosen should show here)
:Prompt A, B, C
On the next line of the program, we will take the values of A, B and C and use
them to calculate the values of the roots of the equation. Type in the following:
PROGRAM: Name
:Promptp
A, B, C
:(−B + p(B 2 − 4AC))/(2A) → R
:(−B − (B 2 − 4AC))/(2A) → S

In typing these two lines it’s important that when you type −B, you use the negative key next to the decimal point, rather than the subtraction key. The calculator
is very picky about this. When you’re typing the B 2 − 4AC, you’ll need to use the
subtraction key on the far right of the keypad.
Also notice the double parentheses - one set for the numerator of the fraction
and one set for the square root. If you don’t type this in correctly it will produce
wrong answers. The arrow in the formula stores the values of the answer in the
variables R and S, and the arrow is produced by the ”sto→” key just above the
ON button in the lower left of the keyboard.
Now that we’ve given the calculator the values for A, B and C and then had
the calculator find the roots of the eqatiuon, we need to display the answers. If
you press the prgm key and arrow over to the I/O menu again, you can choose
3:Disp. This will Display the answers that we’ve stored as R and S.
PROGRAM: Name
:Prompt√A, B, C
:(−B + √B 2 − 4AC))/(2A) → R
:(−B − B 2 − 4AC))/(2A) → S
:Disp R,S
Now we can test the program with some simple equations. To run the program,
press the program key and choose the program you’ve created either by selecting
it and pressing enter, or by pressing the number for the program in the list. This
should bring you back to the calculation screen, where you can run the program
by pressing enter. The calculator should then ask you for the values of A, B and
C.

1.3. QUADRATIC EQUATIONS
Solve for x:

31

2x2 − x − 1 = 0

In this example the values for A, B and C are:
A=2
B = −1
C = −1
Again, it’s important that you use the negative sign key next to the decimal point
for the values of any negative coefficients and not the subtraction key. The calculator should return values of 1 and −0.5 as the solutions.
Solve for x:

x2 + x + 1 = 0

In this example the values for A, B and C are:
A=1
B=1
C=1
The calculator should return values of −0.5 ± 0.8660254038i as solutions.
If you get an error message saying ”NONREAL ANSWERS,” you’ll need to adjust the calculator setting to allow for complex valued answers. You can do this
by presing the ”mode” key in the top left of the keypad and arrowing down to the
line that reads ”REAL
a+bi
reˆ(θi).” You can then arrow over to ”a+bi” and
press enter. This will allow the calculator to compute complex valued answers.
Something very important to remember about the quadratic formula is that the
equation must be in standard form in order to identify the values of A, B and C
to use in the formula. For example in the equation:
3x2 − 7 = 2x
it is important to understand that the values of A, B and C come from the standard form of the equation and not the present form of the equation. There are
several pitfalls to watch out for in this equation. First of all, the 2x is on the opposite side of the equation from the other terms. That means that the value of B
IS NOT +2. Also, if we were to move the 2x to the other side to put the equation
in standard form, it is not the order of the terms, but degree of the variable that
determines whether a coefficient is identified as A, B or C.

32

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

In moving the 2x to the other side of the equation, I have seen students put the
term they’re adding to that side as the last term. There is nothing wrong about
this, but if you do that, you must be careful about identifying the values of A, B
and C.
3x2 − 7 = 2x
−2x = −2x
3x2 − 7 − 2x = 0
There is nothing wrong about the way the equation above is written depsite the
fact that it is not in ”standard form.” The important thing to remember is that ”A”
is not the coefficient of whichever term is listed first. It is the coefficient of the
quradratic, or x2 term. Likewise, ”B” is not the coefficient of the second term, but
rather the coefficient of the linear, or x1 term. And ”C” is not whichever number
comes last, but rather the value of the constant term. So in the equation above,
however it is written, the value of A is +3, B is −2 and C is −7.

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

Complex Numbers

Our number system can be subdivided in many different ways. The most basic
form of mathematics is counting and almost all human cultures have words to
represent numbers (the Pirahã of South America are a notable exception). Thus
the most basic set of numbers is the set of counting numbers represented by the
double barred N: N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . . } (we will set aside the debate as to
whether or not zero should be included in this set).
If we try to subtract a larger counting number from a smaller counting number
we find that there are no members in the set of counting numbers to represent
the answer in this situation. This extends the set of natural numbers to the set of
integers: Z = {. . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . }. The integers are represneted by the
double barred Z, for the German word for numbers - ”zahlen.” In the earliest appearances of negative numbers in the Chinese and Indian mathematical systems,
negative values were often used to represent debt. Because Greek mathematics
was based on Geometry, they did not use negative numbers.
Moving to multiplication and division, if we question the value of 8 ÷ 2 = 4 versus 8 ÷ 3 =?, we once again must expand our conception of numbers to allow
for an answer to the second question 8 ÷ 3 =?. Understanding ratios of whole
numbers or Rational numbers allows solutions to such problems. The set of Rational numbers isrepresented by the double barred Q, to represent a quotient:
a
: a, b ∈ Z .
Q=
b
The Greek understanding of numbers mostly stopped here. They felt that all
quantities could be represented as the ratio of whole numbers. The length of
the diagonal of a square whose sides are of length 1 produced considerable consternation among the Pythagoreans as a result of this. Using the Pythagorean
Theorem for the diagonal of a square whose sides
√ are of length 1 shows that the
2
2
2
diagonal would be c = 1 + 1 = 2, thus c = 2. This number cannot be represented as a ratio of whole numbers. This new class of numbers adds the set
of irrational numbers to the existing set of rational numbers to create the Real
numbers, represented with a double barred R: R.

1.4. COMPLEX NUMBERS

35

This hierarchy of numbers is often represented in the following diagram:

R
Q

Z
N
One of the best ways to conceptualize the Real number system is on the number
line - every point on the number line corresponds to a unique Real number and
every Real number corresponds to a unique position on the Real number line.

After the development of the printing press in the 15th century, Fibonacci’s Liber
Abaci was translated into Italian from Latin and read throughout Italy. As a result,
Italy became a thriving center of mathematics until the 17th century, when the
center of European mathematics moved north to France, Germany and England.
Throughout the 1500’s Italian mathematicians such as Girolamo Cardano, Raphael
Bombelli and Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia worked to extend the ideas in Fibonacci’s
book. They produced formulas to solve cubic (x3 ), and quartic (x4 ) degree equations. In solving some of these equations they found that their formulas sometimes produced negative values under a square root. None of the known number
systems could accomodate this possibility. In Cardano’s book on algebra Ars
Magna, he encounters a problem which involves the square root of a negative
number. He says, ”It is clear that this case is impossible. Nevertheless we will
work thus...” and he proceeds to compute a valid complex solution
to the prob√
lem. Mathematicians eventually defined the complex unit −1 = i and then

36

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

devised a system in which all complex numbers are a combination of a Real part
(a) and an ”imaginary” part (bi).
The complex numbers are a two dimensional number system represented by the
double√barred C: C = {a + bi : a, b ∈ R}, where i is the complex unit defined
as i = −1. Throughout the late 1700’s and early 1800’s mathematicians gradually moved towards a geometrical interpretation of the two-dimensional complex
numbers. What is today known as the ”Argand diagram” represents the real valued portion of a complex number along a horizontal axis and the multiple of the
complex unit along the vertical axis.

Adding, subtracting and multiplying with complex numbers
Calculating with complex numbers has many similarities to working with variables. The real part and imginary part are treated separately for addition and
subtraction, but can be multiplied and divided.
Examples
Compute the following:
(6 − 4i) + (−2 + 7i) = 4 + 3i

(−9 + 2i) − (−4 + 6i) = −9 + 2i + 4 − 6i = −5 − 4i

3(10 + i) = 30 + 3i

−7i(−5 + 8i) = 35i − 56i2
Now we encounter an interesting fact about
complex numbers and, in particular,
√
the complex unit i. By definition, i = −1. Therefore, if we square i we should
get −1. In the last example problem above, we can replace the i2 with −1 to finish
the problem.

38

= 81 + 36i + 4(−1)

= 77 + 36i

1.4. COMPLEX NUMBERS

39

Powers of i
The powers of i follow an interesting pattern based on the definition that i2 = −1.
We can see that i1 = i and that i2 = −1, as a result, i3 = i2 ∗ i1 = −1 ∗ i = −i.
In a similar fashion, i4 = i2 ∗ i2 = (−1)(−1) = 1.
This means that i5 = i4 ∗ i = 1 ∗ i = i.
If we put all of this information together we get the following:
i1 = i
i2 = −1
i3 = −i
i4 = 1
i5 = i1 = i
i6 = i2 = −1
i7 = i3 = −i
i8 = i4 = 1
In other words, every power of i is equivalent to either i, −1, −i, or 1. To determine which of these values a power of i is equivalent to, we need to find the
remainder of the exponent when it is divided by 4.
Example
Simplify i38
Since every i4 = 1, then i38 = i36 ∗ i2 = (i4 )9 ∗ i2 = 19 ∗ i2 = i2 = −1
Since 38 is 2 more than a multiple of 4, then i38 = i2 = −1.

Quadratic Equations with Complex Roots

In Section 1.3, we considered the solution of quadratic equations that had two
real-valued roots. This was due to the fact that in calculating the roots for each
equation, the portion of the quadratic formula that is square rooted (b2 −4ac, often
called the discriminant) was always a positive number.
For example, in using the quadratic formula to calculate the the roots of the equation x2 − 6x + 3 = 0, the discriminant is positive and we will end up with two
real-valued roots:
x2 − 6x + 3 = 0
a = 1, b = −6, c = 3

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

When we added and subtracted the square root of 24 to 6 in the quadratic formula, this created two answers, and they were real-valued because the square
root of 24 is real-valued.
Another way to see this is graphically. If we graph y = x2 − 6x + 3 and find the x
values that make y = 0 , these will appear along the x-axis, and will be the same
values that solve the equation x2 − 6x + 3 = 0.

If we consider a related, but slightly different equation to start with, these relationships between the roots, the discriminant and the graphical intersections will
be slightly different.

Because the discriminant was 0 in this problem, we only get one real-valued answer.
Graphically, the additional 6 that was added to the original equation to change it

Here the discriminant is negative, which leads to two complex-valued answers.
If the equation has real-valued coefficients, the complex roots will always come
in conjugate pairs. Complex conjugates share the same real-valued part and have
opposite signs in their complex-valued (or imaginary) parts: a ± bi
Graphically, the previous problem was one step away from not intersecting the
x-axis at all and the additional three units that we added on to get y = x2 −
6x + 12 moves the graph entirely away from the x-axis. Because the roots are
complex-valued, we don’t see any roots on the x-axis. The x-axis contains only
real numbers.

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions

Reducing Rational Expressions
A rational expression is simply an algebraic fraction, and our first consideration
will be to reduce these expressions to lowest terms in the same way that we re2
6
to by canceling
duce numerical fractions to lowest terms. When we reduce
15

the common factor of three, we are removing a redundant factor of 1 in the form

It’s important to remeber that only common factors can be canceled. This means

1.6. MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS

51

that the first priority in each problem will be to identify the factors of the numerator and denominator to see if they share any common factors.
Example
Reduce to lowest terms.
x2 + 4x − 12
x2 − 4
x2 + 4x − 12
(x + 6)(x − 2)
=
x2 − 4
(x + 2)(x − 2)

=


(x + 6)
(x−2)

(x + 2)
(x−2)

=

x+6
x+2

Notice that we can’t cancel the 6 and the 2 in the final answer because they aren’t
factors. The plus signs in the numerator and denominator prevent us from cancelling the 6 and the 2.
In the previous examples, we saw that cancelling out common factors in the numerator and denominator was actually a process of eliminating a redundant factor of 1. In the following example, we’ll see a slightly different form of cancelling.
Example
Reduce to lowest terms.
16 − x2
x2 + x − 20
16 − x2
(4 + x)(4 − x)
=
2
x + x − 20
(x + 5)(x − 4)
In this problem, there are no common factors, but we can do some cancelling. We
can see that (4 − x) and (x − 4) are not the same expression. In the first binomial,

52

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

the 4 is positive and the x is negative, whereas in the second binomial, the 4 is
4−x
negative and the x is positive. So, we know that
6= 1. However, if we factor
x−4
a (−1) out of the numerator, we will see an interesting phenomenon:
4−x
−1(−4 + x)
=
x−4
x−4
=

−1(x − 4)
x−4

= −1 ∗

x−4
x−4

= −1 ∗ 1 = −1
4−x
4−x
6= 1, we can say that
= −1. This will allow us to
x−4
x−4
cancel (4 − x) and (x − 4) and replace them with (−1).

Therefore, although

(4 + x)(4 − x)
=
x2 + x − 20
(x + 5)(x − 4)

=


(4 + x)
(4−x)

(x + 5)
(x−4)(−1)

In the final answer, the (−1) can be placed in the denominator or the numerator,
but not both. It can also be placed in front of the fraction.

Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions
In multiplying and dividing rational expressions, it is often easier to identify and
cancel out common factors before multiplying rather than afterwards. Multiplying rational expressions works the same way that multiplying numerical fractions does - multiply straight across the top and straight across the bottom. As a
result, any factor in either numerator of the problem will end up in the numerator of the answer. Likewise, any factor in either denominator of the problem will
end up in the denominator of the answer. Thus, any factor in either numerator
can be cancelled with any factor in either denominator.

Multiply. Express your answer in simplest form.

Dividing rational expressions works in much the same way that dividing numerical fractions does. We multiply by the reciprocal. There are several ways to
demonstrate that this is a valid definition for dividing. First, it is important to
understand that the fraction bar is the same as a “divided by” symbol:
8
= 8 ÷ 2 = 4.

Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions

Rational Equations

We can also use the skills we have covered in previous sections to solve equations
involving rational expressions. There are three main methods of solution that will
be explored in this section - multiplying on both sides to clear a denominator,
cross-multiplying, and making common denominators. Each of these techniques
is actually the same process, but approached from a slightly different perspective.

Clearing a denominator
Often, if the denominator is a single variable, it can be easy and striaghtforward
to multiply on both sides by the denominator to cancel it out.
Example
Solve for x.
x+

4
=7
x

If we multiply on both sides by x, it will clear the variable from the denominator:

x+

4
=7
x


4
x∗ x+
= (7) ∗ x
x
x∗x+x∗

4
= 7x
x

Multiply on both sides by x

Distribute the x

x2 + 4 = 7x
x2 − 7x + 4 = 0
x ≈ 0.628, 6.372

Standard form

68

CHAPTER 1. ALGEBRA REVIEW

If a problem is stated simply as the equality of two fractions, cross-multiplying
can be a useful method of solution.
Example
Solve for x.
x
7
=
2x + 3
x−4
7
x
=
2x + 3
x−4
x(x − 4) = 7(2x + 3)
x2 − 4x = 14x + 21
x2 − 18x − 21 = 0
x ≈ 19.100, −1.100
Cross-multiplying is really just a short-cut method of clearing out the denominators by multiplying on both sides by both denominators:
7
x
=
2x + 3
x−4
(x − 4)(2x + 3) ∗

7
x
=
∗ (x − 4)(2x + 3)
2x + 3
x−4




2x+ 3 
x −
4




x(x − 4) = 7(2x + 3)
Then the equation is ready to be solved as shown above - but by just crossmulitiplying, we skip directly to the solution portion of the problem.

1.9. RATIONAL EQUATIONS

Sometimes, it is helpful to create a common denominator in order to set up a
situation where cross-multiplying can be used.

Addendum - Word Problems
Following are a selection of word problems - some from ancient times, some from
the Renaissance and Enlightenment, and some from the 19th and 20th century.
1)
A teacher agreed to work 9 months for $562.50 and board. At the end of
the term, on account of two months absence caused by illness, he received only
$409.50 for his seven months work. If the teacher used all nine months of his
board during the term, what was his board per month? (American 1892)

2)
A servant is promised $100 plus a cloak as wages for a year. After seven
months, he leaves and receives $20 plus the cloak. How much is the cloak worth?

The sales tax on garments is 20
ments, paying in copper coins. Two garments and 10 copper coins are paid as
tax. What is the price of a garment, O learned one? (Ancient India)

4)
Two wine merchants enter Paris, one of them with 64 casks of wine, the
other with 20 casks (all of the same value). Since they do not have enough money
to pay the customs duties, the first pays 5 casks of wine and 40 francs, and the
second pays 2 casks of wine and receives 40 francs change. What is the price of
each cask of wine and what is the duty on each cask? (Chuquet, French 1484)

5)
One of two men had 12 fish and the other had 13 fish, and all of the fish
were of the same price. From the first man, a customs agent took away 1 fish and
12 denarii for payment. From the other man he took 2 fish and gave him back 7
denarii as change. Find the customs fee and the price of each fish.
(Fibonacci, Italian 1202)

6)
Two traders transporting sheepskins approach their country’s border. The
first trader has 100 sheepskins and the border guard takes 10 sheepskins plus $25
as a tariff. The second trader has 42 sheepskins and for a tariff, the border guard
takes 7 sheepskins but returns $14 change. What is the tariff per sheepskin and
what is the value of each sheepskin?

Two people have a certain amount of money. The first says to the second,
“If you give me 5 denarii, I will have 7 times what you have left.” The second
says to the first, “If you give me 7 denarii, I will have 5 times what you have left.”
How much money does each have? Round to the nearest 10th.
(Leonardo, Italian c. 1500)

8)

Two different scenarios from Ancient Greece:

Two friends were walking. One said to the other, “If I had 10 more coins, I would
have 3 times as much money as you.” The other said, “If I had 10 more coins, I
would have five times as much as you.” How many coins does each have?

I would have 3 times as much money as you.” The other said, “If you give me 10
of your coins, I would have five times as much as you.” How many coins does
each have?

9)
Andy and Betty together have $6 less than Christine. If Betty gives $5 to
Andy, then Andy will have half as much as Christine. If, instead, Andy gives $5
to Betty, then Andy will have one-third as much as Betty. How much does each
person have to begin with?

10)
Three friends (A, B and C) each have a certain amount of money. A says,
“I have as much as B plus one-third as much as C.” B says, “I have as much as C
plus one-third as much as A.” C says, “I have 10 more than one-third of B.” How
much does each person have? (Ancient Greece)

11)
On a test, 39 more pupils passed than failed. On the next test, 7 who passed
the first test failed and one-third of those who failed the first test passed the second. As a result, 31 more passed the second test than failed it. What was the
record of passing and failing on the first test?

Polynomial and Rational Functions
This chapter will explore the solution of equations and inequalities involving
both polynomial and rational functions, primarily through the examination of
their graphical representations. We will also explore the use of polynomial long
division and synthetic division in breaking down polynomials into their prime
factors and the relationship between factors and roots.

2.1

Representing Intervals

Many of the problems in this chapter will have solutions that must be expressed
as an interval. This means a range of x values that will satisfy the original problem. In this section, we will introduce the translation of graphical intervals into
algebraic notation.
For example, in the diagram below, we would represent the interval shown on
the graph as x < −3.

These intervals would be represented as x < −4 OR x ≥ 6.
Sometimes students try to represent the intervals above as 6 ≤ x < −4, however,
this expression would represent a single interval where x is both less than −4
and, at the same time, greater than or equal to +6. This is simply not possible, and
would result in the empty set, which is the reason that the OR portion is needed
in the correct answer.

On this graph, there is one interval beginning at −5 and ending at +5 and another beginning at 30 and continuing to infinity. Thus, these intervals would be
represented as −5 < x ≤ 5 OR x ≥ 30.
Students familiar with another form of interval notation may wish to represent
this interval as (−5, 5]∪[30, ∞). Both forms of notation accomplish the same goal.

CHAPTER 2. POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

Solution by Graphing

In previous courses the solution of linear equations is covered, generally by separating the variables and constants on opposite sides of the equation to isolate the
variable. In the previous chapter we examined the solution of quadratic equations, in which the variable is isolated using the technique of completing the
square. The major difference between these methods of solution is that, in the
solving of quadratic equations, we must contend with several different powers
of the variable which makes it considerably more difficult to isolate the variable.
There are formulas like the quadratic formula available to solve cubic (x3 ) and
quartic (x4 ) equations, however these formulas are somewhat cumbersome and
archaic. The primary method for solving eqautions of degree higher than 2 is
solution by graphing or by algorithm.
Solution by algorithm is a very interesting process as there are many different
algorithms available. Which algorithm is most appropriate often depends on the
types of equations being solved and the technology available to solve them. Two
major types of algorithms that rely on the graphincal representation of an equation are called “Double False Position” and “The Newton-Raphson Method.”
Many commonly available pieces of techonolgy use one of these methods. Since
we have graphing calculators available to us, we will focus on solution by graphing.
Whether using a TI (Texas Instruments) or Casio graphing calculator, or a software based graphing ustility such as Graph or Desmos, the solution of these
equations focuses on finding the x-intercepts of the graph since this is where
the y value is 0. The specific processes for solving equations using each of these
different tools will be covered in class.
Example
Solve for x.
x3 − 3x2 = 2x − 7
The first step is to move all terms to one side of the equation and set them equal
to zero.
x3 − 3x2 − 2x + 7 = 0

2.2. SOLUTION BY GRAPHING

Then we graph the function and look for which x values will make the y value
equal to 0.

In this graph, we can see three roots, or x-intercepts, where the graph crosses the
x-axis. These are the x-values that make the y-value equal to 0. We can use the
available technology to find these x-values.

So, we can see that the solutions to the eqaution x3 − 3x2 − 2x + 7 = 0 are
x ≈ −1.491, 1.657, 2.834.
We can check these answers by plugging them back into the original equation.

= −3.3146 − 6.669 + 2.982 + 7
= −0.0016
The result is not exactly 0 since our answers have been rounded off to the 1000th
place. If we wanted greater accuracy, then we should include greater accuracy in
the value of our answers.

Solution of Polynomial Inequalities by Graphing

In this section, we will combine the concepts of the previous two sections to solve
polynomial inequalities. In Section 2.2, we solved equations by graphing and
finding the x-values which made y = 0. In solving an inequality, we will be
concerned with finding the range of x values that make y either greater than or
less than 0, depending on the given problem.
Example
Solve the given inequality.
2x3 + 8x2 + 5x − 3 ≥ 0

y = 2x3 + 8x2 + 5x − 3

Then we identify the intervals of x-values that make the y value greater than or

The indicated roots of the function (A, B and C) are the x-values that make y
equal to zero. These points divide the graph between the regions where y is
greater than zero and the regions where y is less than zero. The solution to the
given inequlaity 2x3 + 8x2 + 5x − 3 ≥ 0 are A≤ x ≤B OR x ≥C.
When we find the values of A, B and C: A= −3, B≈ −1.366 and C≈ 0.366, we can
complete the solution to the problem.
2x3 + 8x2 + 5x − 3 ≥ 0
−3 ≤ x ≤ −1.366 OR x ≥ 0.366

Example
Solve the given inequality.
x4 − 2x3 − 5x2 + 8x + 3 ≤ 0
First, we graph the function:

In this problem, we’re looking for the intervals of x values that make y less than

So, the solution to the original inequality is:
x4 − 2x3 − 5x2 + 8x + 3 ≤ 0
−2.034 ≤ x ≤ −0.320 OR 1.806 ≤ x ≤ 2.549

In the next example we’ll be looking to identify both the intervals where y is
greater than zero, and the intervals where y is less than zero.

Example
Determine the interval(s) for which x3 + 5x2 + 5x + 1 ≥ 0
Determine the interval(s) for which x3 + 5x2 + 5x + 1 < 0
Once again, we’ll start by graphing the function to find the roots:

greater than zero and where they’re less than zero.
For y ≥ 0, we can see that this corresponds to: −3.732 ≤ x ≤ −1 OR x ≥ −0.268
For y < 0, we can see that this corresponds to: x < −3.732 OR −1 < x < −0.268

CHAPTER 2. POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

Solution of Rational Inequalities by Graphing

In the previous section, we saw how to solve polynomial inequalities by graphing. In this section, we will use similar methods to solve rational inequalities.
Rational inequalities involve ratios of polynomials or fractions. Because these
types of problems involve fractions, the graphs of the functions that we work
with will have what are known as asymptotes. This word comes from a Greek
root having to do with two lines that come very close to each other but never
meet.
The vertical asymptotes of a graph will appear at places where the original expression has a zero denominator. This means that the function is not defined at
those x values and so, rather than having a y value at that point, the graph has an
asymptote.
Example
Below is a graph of the function y =

x+2
x−1

5

−8 −6 −4 −2

2

4

6

8

−5

Rather than having a y value at the point where x = 1, the dotted line indicates
the asymptote where the function is not defined. In the previous section, we were
interested in finding the roots of the function because these are the places where
y = 0, and can be the dividing points between where the y values are greater than
zero (y > 0) and the where the y values are less than zero (y < 0).

2.4. SOLUTION OF RATIONAL INEQUALITIES BY GRAPHING

101

The importance of the asymptotes in analyzing rational functions is that, like the
roots, these represent x values that can be the dividing points between where
y > 0 and where y < 0.
Example
Solve the given inequality.
2
>0
x−3
First we examine the graph:

5

−8 −6 −4 −2

2

6

8

−5

Notice that the asymptote for this graph occurs at the value x = 3, because this is
the x value that creates a zero denominator. Also notice that the y values switch
from being negative to being positive across the asymptote.
There are no roots for this function because there are no x values that make y = 0.
For a fraction to be zero, the numerator must equal zero. In this example the
numerator is 2 and no value of x will make it equal zero. Therefore the only
possible dividing point on the graph is x = 3, and the solution to the inequality
is x > 3.

102

Example
Solve the given inequality.
x−2

In this inequality, there is again an asymptote at x = 3, but there is also a root at

=
= 0. So we have two
the value x = 2, because when x = 2. y =
2−3
−1
dividing points to consider, x = 2 and x = 3. We can see from the graph that
y > 0 for x < 2 or x > 3, so that is the solution to the given inequality.
Example
Solve the given inequality.
x2 − 2
>0
x−3
In this problem, we have the same asymptote as the previous two problems: x =
3. However, in this inequality, there are two roots, because there are two x values
that make the numerator equal zero.
√
x2 − 2 = 0 means that x2 = 2 and x = ± 2 ≈ ±1.414
We can see these roots on the graph.

In the graph above, we can see the asymptote at x = 3 and the two roots at

The x values that make y > 0 are −1.414 < x < 1.414 OR x > 3.

Solve the given inequality.

The roots for this function are the x values that make the numerator equal zero:
x − 2 = 0, therefore x = 2, and we can see this root on the graph.

CHAPTER 2. POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

The asymptotes for the function are the x values that make the denominator equal

or equal to zero are −6.193 ≤ x ≤ −2.414 OR −0.807 ≤ x ≤ 0.414.

CHAPTER 2. POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

Finding Factors from Roots

One method of solving equations involves finding the factors of the polynomial
expression in the equation and then setting each factor equal to zero.
x2 + 8x + 15 = 0
(x + 5)(x + 3) = 0
x+5=0

x+3=0

x = −5

x = −3

In this process, the reasoning is that if (x + 5) times (x + 3) equals zero, then one
of those expressions must be equal to zero. In setting them equal to zero, we find
the solutions of x = −5, −3. Plugging them back into the factored expression we
see the following:
(−5 + 5)(−5 + 3) = 0 ∗ −2 = 0
and
(−3 + 5)(−3 + 3) = 2 ∗ 0 = 0
This process works in reverse as well. In other words, if we know a root of the
function, we can find factors for the expression.
Example
Find a quadratic equation that has roots of −2 and +3.
x = −2
x+2=0

x=3
x−3=0

(x + 2)(x − 3) = 0
x2 − x + 6 = 0

Polynomial Long Division

Polynomial long division has many similarities to numerical long division, so it
is important that we understand how and why numerical long division works
the way it does before discussing polynomial long division. First the HOW?
Given the numerical problem 87, 462÷38, the first step is to determine the highest
place value in the answer.
2
38)87, 462
Often the first step in numerical long division is to say “Does 38 divide into 8?”
“No.” “Does 38 divide into 87?” “Yes.” This tells us that the first digit in the
answer will be over the 7 in 87,462, and consequently will be in the thousands
place. Once we know that the first digit in the answer will be in the thousands
place, the next question is “How many thousands?” We can determine that 2 ∗
38 = 76 but 3∗38 = 114 (too big), so we know that the first digit in the answer will
be 2. Then we subtract, include the 4 and examine what is left over to continue.
2
38)87, 462
−76
114
Here, we see that 114 ÷ 38 = 3, so we know that the next digit in the answer will
be 3.
23
38)87, 462
−76
114
−114
0006
After including the 6, we can see that 38 does not divide evenly into 6, so we put
a zero as the next digit in our answer and proceed:

112

2 30
38)87, 462
−76
114
−114
0006

00062

Now that we have included all the digits from our original number 87,462, the
last step is to divide 38 into 62. This goes one time with 24 left over.

38)87, 462
−76

−114
0006
−0
00062

00024
So, now we have the solution to the original problem 87, 462 ÷ 38 = 2, 301 R24 or
24
.
2, 301 38
The WHY? of the long division algorithm is somewhat hidden by the HOW? In
the first step, we are determining which place value will hold the first digit of our
answer. When we determine that 38 does divide into 87, this indicates that the
first digit in our answer will be the thousands place. Dividing 38 into 87 tells us
how many thousands there will be. Then we subtract:
87, 462
−76, 000
11, 462

2.6. POLYNOMIAL LONG DIVISION

113

Now we need to determine how many times 38 will divide into 11,462. We decided on 300 ∗ 38 = 11, 400, then we subtract to see how much is left over:
11, 462
−11, 400
00, 062
We can see that we won’t need any tens in our answer, and that 38 divides into 62
one time with 24 left over, thus the answer is 2 thousands, 3 hundreds, no tens, 1
and a remainder of 24. To check the answer, we multiply 38 ∗ 2301 and add 24:
2, 301
×38
18408
6903
87438
+24
87462
Polynomial long division works in much the same way that numerical long division does. Given a problem A ÷ B, the goal is to find a quotient Q and remainder
R so that A = B ∗ Q + R.
Let’s look at this with the example 2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1 ÷ x2 + 3x + 1 or:
2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1
x2 + 3x + 1
So, we are looking to answer the question:
A

=

B

∗

Q

+R

2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1 = (x2 + 3x + 1) ∗ (?+?+?)+?
If we want to mulitply x2 + 3x + 1 times something and end up with 2x4 + 7x3 +
4x2 − 2x − 1, then what we multiply by is going to have to start with 2x2 , because
x2 ∗ 2x2 = 2x4 .

114

CHAPTER 2. POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

Now we’re working with this:
A

=

B

∗

Q

+R

2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1 = (x2 + 3x + 1) ∗ (2x2 +?+?)+?
But the 2x2 doesn’t just get multiplied by the x2 , it will also get multiplied by the
3x and the 1. So now we have:
A

=

B

∗

Q

+R

2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1 = (x2 + 3x + 1) ∗ (2x2 +?+?)+?
= 2x4 + 6x3 + 2x2 +?????
The issue this raises is that the next multiplication (? ∗ x2 +? ∗ 3x+? ∗ 1) needs to
add only 1x3 to our answer, because we need 7x3 and we already have 6x3 from
the previous multiplication. That means we’re going to want to multiply next by
1x:

A

=

B

∗

Q

+R

2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1 = (x2 + 3x + 1) ∗ (2x2 + 1x+?)+?
= 2x4 + 6x3 + 2x2
=

1x3 + 3x2 + x

= 2x4 + 7x3 + 5x2 + 1x+???
In the next round of mutiplication, we’re going to want to bring the 5x2 down to
4x2 , so we’ll need to multiply by −1.

2.6. POLYNOMIAL LONG DIVISION

2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1 = (x2 + 3x + 1) ∗ (2x2 + 1x − 1) + 0

=
=

1x3 + 3x2 + x
−1x2 − 3x − 1

= 2x4 + 7x3 + 5x2 − 2x − 1
Now we also know that the remainder is zero, because x2 + 3x + 1 divides evenly
into 2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1 and so:
2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1 = (x2 + 3x + 1) ∗ (2x2 + 1x − 1)
This method makes the reasoning behind dividing polynomials somewhat more
apparent than the long division process, but it is more cumbersome. The way
that polynomial long division is usually approached is as follows:

x2 + 3x + 1



2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1

Then, just as we did in the other method, we question “What should we multiply
x2 by to get 2x4 ?” Answer: “2x2 ” This is the first term in our answer:

x2 + 3x + 1



2x2
2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1

Then we multiply 2x2 (x2 + 3x + 1) and change all the signs to see what we’ll be
left with:
2x2
x2 + 3x + 1
2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1
− 2x4 − 6x3 − 2x2


116

CHAPTER 2. POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

This indicates that we’ll have the 2x4 we’ll need in our answer, as well six of the
seven x3 ’s and two of the four x2 ’s. We’ll now need 1x3 next:
2x2
x2 + 3x + 1
2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1
− 2x4 − 6x3 − 2x2
x3 + 2x2 − 2x


This means we’ll need to multiply by 1x:
2x2 + x
x2 + 3x + 1
2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1
− 2x4 − 6x3 − 2x2
x3 + 2x2 − 2x
− x3 − 3x2 − x
− x2 − 3x − 1


Here, we still need to pick up a −1x2 , which means that our next multiplication
will be with −1:
2x2 + x − 1
x2 + 3x + 1
2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1
− 2x4 − 6x3 − 2x2
x3 + 2x2 − 2x
− x3 − 3x2 − x
− x2 − 3x − 1
x2 + 3x + 1
0


Because x2 + 3x + 1 divides evenly into 2x4 + 7x3 + 4x2 − 2x − 1 we have a zero
remainder. In the next example there will be a non-zero remainder:
Example
Divide:
3x4 − 8x3 + 19x2 − 15x + 10
x2 − x + 4

2.6. POLYNOMIAL LONG DIVISION

117

First, we set up the problem:

x2 − x + 4



3x4 − 8x3 + 19x2 − 15x + 10

Then, we question: “What do we need to multiply x2 by to get 3x4 ?” Answer:
“3x2 ”

x2 − x + 4



3x2
3x4 − 8x3 + 19x2 − 15x + 10

Then, we multiply, change signs (subtract) and combine like terms:
3x2
x2 − x + 4
3x4 − 8x3 + 19x2 − 15x + 10
− 3x4 + 3x3 − 12x2
− 5x3 + 7x2 − 15x


Now we’ll need to multiply by −5x, change signs and combine like terms:
3x2 − 5x

x2 − x + 4
3x4 − 8x3 + 19x2 − 15x + 10
− 3x4 + 3x3 − 12x2
− 5x3 + 7x2 − 15x
5x3 − 5x2 + 20x
2x2 + 5x + 10
We need 2x2 so we’ll need to multiply by 2, change signs and combine like terms:
3x2 − 5x + 2
x2 − x + 4
3x4 − 8x3 + 19x2 − 15x + 10
− 3x4 + 3x3 − 12x2
− 5x3 + 7x2 − 15x
5x3 − 5x2 + 20x
2x2 + 5x + 10
− 2x2 + 2x − 8
7x + 2


118

CHAPTER 2. POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

Because there is no positive power of x that we can multiply x2 by to get 7x, then
this is our remainder: 7x + 2.

CHAPTER 2. POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

Synthetic Division

The process for polynomial long division (like the process for numerical long
division) has been separated somewhat from its logical underpinnings for a more
efficient method to arrive at an answer. For particular types of polynomial long
division, we can even take this abstraction one step further. Synthetic Division is
a handy shortcut for polynomial long division problems in which we are dividing
by a linear polynomial. This means that the highest power of x we are dividing by
needs to be x1 . This limits the usefulness of Synthetic Division, but it will serve
us well for certain purposes. Let’s examine where the coefficients in our answer
come from when we divide by a linear polynomial:


x−5

2x3
2x4 − 6x3 − 23x2 + 16x − 5
− 2x4 + 10x3
4x3 − 23x2

Notice that the first coefficient in the answer is the same as the first coefficient in
the polynomial we’re dividing into. This is because we’re dividing by a polynomial in the form 1x1 − a. This also makes the power of the first term in the answer
one less than the power of the polynomial we are dividing into. Let’s see where
the subsequent coefficients in the answer come from:


x−5

2x3 + 4x2
2x4 − 6x3 − 23x2 + 16x − 5
− 2x4 + 10x3
4x3 − 23x2
− 4x3 + 20x2
− 3x2 + 16x

The next coefficient in the answer (4) comes from the combination of the −6 and
the +10. The +10 came from multiplying the 2 in the answer by the 5 in the
divisor x − 5. The next coefficient in the answer will be −3, which comes from
multiplying the 4 (in the answer) by the 5 (in the divisor) and combining it with
the −23 in the polynomial we’re dividing into:

2.7. SYNTHETIC DIVISION

121


x−5

2x3 + 4x2 − 3x
2x4 − 6x3 − 23x2 + 16x − 5
− 2x4 + 10x3
4x3 − 23x2
− 4x3 + 20x2
− 3x2 + 16x
3x2 − 15x

The last part of our answer will come from multiplying the −3 in the answer
times the 5 in the divisor (making −15) and combining this with the +16 in the
polynomial we’re dividing into:


x−5

2x3 + 4x2 − 3x + 1
2x4 − 6x3 − 23x2 + 16x − 5
− 2x4 + 10x3
4x3 − 23x2
− 4x3 + 20x2
− 3x2 + 16x
3x2 − 15x
1x − 5
−x+5
0

The process of Synthetic Division uses these relationships as a shortcut to finding
the answer. The set-up for a Synthetic Division problem is shown below:

The first coefficient in the answer is the same as the first coefficient in the polynomial we’re dividing into:
5

To get the next coefficient, we multiply the 2 by the 5 to get +10 and flll this in
under the −6:

16 −5

Then, −6 + 10 = +4, which is the next coefficient in the answer:
5

↓ +10

16 −5

Then, we continue this process, multiplying the 4 by the 5 to get 20 and combining this with the −23: −23 + 20 = −3:
5

Next, multiply the −3 by the 5 and combine the resulting −15 with the 16:

Let’s look at another example:
Example
Use Synthetic Division to divide:
3x3 + 5x2 − 9x + 9
x+3
Since Synthetic Division is set up to divide by x − a, if we’re dividing by x + 3
we’ll need to use a −3 in the Synthetic Division:

Then, 3 ∗ −3 = −9:

Next, −4 ∗ −3 = +12:

And this example also has a zero remainder:

The answer here is 3x2 − 4x + 3:
3x3 + 5x2 − 9x + 9
= 3x2 − 4x + 3
x+3
and
3x3 + 5x2 − 9x + 9 = (x + 3)(3x2 − 4x + 3)
Let’s look at an example that is a little bit different.
Example
Use Synthetic Division to divide:
6x4 + x3 + 9x2 + x − 2
2x + 1
Synthetic Division is set up to handle problems in which we are dividing by
1x − a. Clearly, this is not the case in this example, however we can work around
this. Another way of looking at setting up the synthetic division is that we use
the number that is the solution to x − a = 0. When we divided by x − 5, we used
+5. When we were dividing by x + 3, we used −3. So, if we’re going to divide by
2x + 1, we’ll use − 12 in the Synthetic Division:
− 12

Then, we proceed as usual:

1 −5 2
10 −4 0

Notice that, again, we have a zero remainder. Also, notice that each coefficient
in our answer has a common factor of 2, which was the coefficient of the x in
2x + 1, which we orginally were going to divide by. What we’ve done here is not
division by 2x + 1, but division by x + 21 .
So, in the end, our work tells us that:
6x4 + x3 + 9x2 + x − 2
= 6x3 − 2x2 + 10x − 4
x + 12
and


1

2
6x + x + 9x + x − 2 = x +
(6x3 − 2x2 + 10x − 4)

Notice that if we factor out the common factor of 2 from our answer, we can
multiply it back into the x + 21 and get an answer for our original problem:

2



6x + x + 9x + x − 2 =


1
2(3x3 − x2 + 5x − 2)
x+
2

= (2x + 1)(3x3 − x2 + 5x − 2)
This means that:
6x4 + x3 + 9x2 + x − 2
= 3x3 − x2 + 5x − 2
2x + 1

126

CHAPTER 2. POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

Another thing to understand about Synthetic Division is that if there is a missing
power of x, then you should include a zero as the coefficient of that power.
Example
Use Synthetic Division to divide:
x3 + 4x − 6
x−2
Since there is no x2 term in the polynomial we’re divding into, we’ll enter a zero
as the coefficient for that term:

CHAPTER 2. POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

Roots and Factorization of Polynomials

In this section we will use some of the skills we have seen in previous sections
in order to find all the roots of a polynomial function (both real and complex)
and also factor the polynomial as the product of prime factors with integer coefficients.
Example
Find all real and complex roots for the given equation. Express the given polynomial as the product of prime factors with integer coefficients.
2x3 − 3x2 + 2x − 8 = 0
First we’ll graph the polynomial to see if we can find any real roots from the
graph:

We can see that there is a root at x = 2. This means that the polynomial will
have a factor of (x − 2). We can use Synthetic Division to find any other factors.
Because x = 2 is a root, we should get a zero remainder:

So, now we know that 2x3 − 3x2 + 2x − 8 = (x − 2)(2x2 + x + 4). To finish the
problem, we can set each factor equal to zero and find the roots:
2x3 − 32 + 2x − 8 = 0
(x − 2)(2x2 + x + 4) = 0
2x2 + x + 4 = 0

Let’s look at an example that has more than one real root:

CHAPTER 2. POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

We can see roots at x = −5, 3, which means that (x+5) and (x−3) are both factors
of this polynomial. We’ll need to divide by both of these factors to break down
the polynomial. First, we divide by (x − 3):

Now we know that 3x4 + 5x3 − 45x2 + 19x − 30 = (x + 5)(x − 3)(3x2 − x + 2) and
so, to finish the problem:
3x4 + 5x3 − 45x2 + 19x − 30 = 0
(x + 5)(x − 3)(3x2 − x + 2) = 0

Next, let’s look at an example where there is a root that is not a whole number:

We can see in the graph that this polynomial has a root at x = − 43 . That means
that the polynomial must have a factor of 3x + 4. We can use Synthetic Division
to find the other factor for this polynomial. Because we know that x = − 34 is a
root, we should get a zero remainder:

answer:
(x + 43 )(3x2 − 3x + 21) = (3x + 4)(x2 − x + 7)
So, this means that:
3x3 + x2 + 17x + 28 = 0
(3x + 4)(x2 − x + 7) = 0
3x + 4 = 0

Exponents and Logarithms
In this chapter, we will examine concepts that are related to exponential, logarithmic and logistic relationships. In the first section, we will look at how to approach
these problems from a graphical perspective. In the subsequent sections, we will
examine the methods necessary to work with these problems algebraically.

3.1

Exponential and Logistic Applications

There are a variety of different types of mathematical relationships. The simplest
mathematical relationship is the additive relationship. This is a situation in which
the value of one quantity is always a certain amount more (or less) than another
quantity. A good example of an additive relationship is an age relationship. In
an age relationship, the age of the older person is always the same amount more
than the age of the younger person. If the older person is five years older, then
the age of the older person (y) will always be equal to the age of the younger
person (x) plus five: y = x + 5.
Another type of additive relationship is seen where two quantities add up to a
constant value. Let’s say there is a board whose length is 20 inches. If we cut
it into two pieces, with one piece being 6 inches, then the other piece will be 14
inches. If one piece is 9 inches, then the other will be 11 inches. If one piece is x
inches, then the other piece (y) will be 20 − x: y = 20 − x or x + y = 20.

135

136

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

The next type of mathematical relationshp is a multiplicative relationship. This
represents a situation in which one quantity is always a multiple of the other
quantity. This is commonly seen in proportional relationships. If a recipe for a
cake calls for 2 cups of flour, then, if we want to make 3 cakes, we’ll need 6 cups
of flour. The amount of flour (y) is always two times the number of cakes we
want to make (x): y = 2x.
If a recipe for a batch of cookies (with 20 cookies per batch) calls for 1.5 cups
of sugar, then three batches would require 4.5 cups of sugar. The amount of
sugar required (y) is always the number of batches (x) times 1.5: y = 1.5x. If we
wanted to represent this relationship based on the number of cookies instead of
the number of batches, we would need to adjust the formula. Given that there are
20 cookies per batch, we could adjust our formula so that we first calculate the
number of batches from the number of cookies and then multiply by 1.5. If the
3
x
or y = 40
x.
number of cookies is x and the amount of sugar is y, then y = 1.5 ∗ 20
The next type of mathematical relationship is the polynomial relationship. In this
type of relationship, one quantity is related to a power of another quantity. A
good example of this type of relationship involves gravity. As Galileo discovered in the 16th century, the distance that an object falls after it is dropped is not
proportional to the time that it has been falling. Rather, it is proportional to the
square of the time. The table below shows this type of relationship.

t

d

1

16

2

64

256

After one second, it looks like the distance will always be sixteen times the time
the object has been falling. However, after two seconds, we can see that this
relationship no longer is true. That’s because this relationship is a polynomial
relationship in which the distance an object has fallen (d) is proportional to the
square of the time it has been falling (t): d = 16t2 .

3.1. EXPONENTIAL AND LOGISTIC APPLICATIONS

137

Exponential Relationships
The next type of relationship is the focus of this chapter - the exponential relationship. In this situation, the rate of change of a quantity is proportional to the size
of that quantity. This relationship can be explored in more depth in an integral
calculus course, but we will discuss the basics here.
In a linear or proportional relationship, the slope, or rate of change, is constant.
For example, in the equation y = 3x + 1, the slope is always three, no matter what
the values of x and y are. In an exponential relationship, the rate of change (also
called ”y prime” or y 0 ) is proportional to the value of y. In this case, we say that
y 0 = k ∗ y.
This is what is known as a differential equation. This is an equation in which the
variable and its rate of change are related. Through the processes of differential
and integral calculus, we can solve the equation above y 0 = k ∗ y as:
y = Aekt
In the equation above, A is the value of y at time t = 0, k is a constant that
determines how fast the quantity y increases or decreases and t plays the role
of the independent variable (as x often does) and represents the time that has
passed. If k is positive, then the quantity y is growing because its rate of change
is positive. If k is negative, then the quantity y is decreasing because the rate of
change is negative.
The quantity represented by e in the above equation is a mathematical constant
(like π) that is often used to represent exponential relationships. The best way to
understand the value of e and what it represents is directly related to fundamental questions from differential and integral calculus.
Differential Calculus is concerned primarily with the question of slopes. We discussed earlier that a linear relationship has a constant slope. Polynomial and exponential relationships have slopes that depend on the value of x and/or y. This
is what makes them curves rather than lines. If we consider the slopes of some
different exponential relationships, we can see one aspect of where the value for
e comes from.

138

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

Consider the graphs of the following relationships:
y = 1.5x
y = 2x
y = 3x
y = 10x
Let’s look at the graphs for these functions:

139

through the point (0, 1) on the graph. This is because 1.50 = 1, 20 = 1, 30 = 1 and
100 = 1. Therefore the point where x is 0 and y is 1 is on all four of the graphs.
Although all four of the graphs pass through the point (0, 1), they each do this
in a different way. Let’s look at the slope of a line tangent to each curve at the
point (0, 1). This is the straight line that touches the curve at the point (0, 1), but
nowhere else:

We can see that the slopes of these tangent lines are all different. In the case of
y = 2x , the slope of the tangent line at (0, 1) is about 0.7, while for the graph of
y = 3x , the slope of the tangent line at (0, 1) is about 1.1.

140

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

As mathematicians examined these graphs during the 17th and 18th centuries,
they began to question what the value of the base ”b” should be in the equation
y = bx so that the slope of the tangent line at the point (0, 1) would be equal to
exactly 1. The answer was e ≈ 2.71828.
Another way to derive the value of e uses Integral Calculus. Integral Calculus is
often concerned with finding the area under a curve. This process can then be
generalized and used to make many other types of calculations that are similar
to finding area.

These values for the area under the curve are actually the same values as those
for the slope of the tangent line in the previous graphs. If you ask the question,
”Where should you draw the second vertical line so that the area under the curve
is equal to exactly 1?” then just like the slope question, the answer is e ≈ 2.71828.
This is how the value of e was determined and why it is used to represent these
exponential relationships.

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

Some phenomena in the natural world exhibit behavior similar to the growth
of this function. However, in the natural world, few, if any, things can grow
unconstrained. Most growth of any kind is limited by the resources that fuel
the growth. Populations often grow exponentially for a period of time, however,
populations are dependent on natural resources to continue growing. As a result,
the simple exponential function is only useful for modeling real-world behavior
if the x-values are limited.
It was this problem with the simple exponential function that led French mathematician Pierre Verhulst to slightly adjust the differential equation that gives rise
to the exponential function to make it more realistic.
The original differential equation said:
y0 = k ∗ y
This says that the rate of growth of y is always directly proportional to the value
of y. In other words the larger a population gets, the faster it will grow - forever.
Verhulst changed this to say:
y 0 = k ∗ y(1 −

y
)
N

This is the defining relationship for the Logistic function. Notice that when values
of y are small, this is essentially the same as the simple exponential. If y is small,
then the (1− Ny ) term will be very close to 1 and will produce behavior very much
like the simple exponential.
The N in the formula is a theoretical “maximum population.” As the value of y
approaches this maximum value, Ny will approach 1 and (1 − Ny ) will get smaller
and smaller. As it gets smaller, the factor of (1 − Ny ) will slow down the growth
of the function to model the pressure that is put on the resources that are driving
the growth.
The solution of the Logistic equation is quite complicated and results in a standard form of:
y=

N
1 + be−kt

The “lazy-s” shape is characteristic of the logistic function. In the early stages,
the relationship shows growth very similar to the simple exponential function,
but, as the function grows larger, the growth decreases and the function values
stabilize. The maximum y value of N is always the horizontal asymptote for the
logistic function.

Negative Exponential Relationships
The Logistic function is very useful for modeling phenomena from the natural
world. Although the simple exponential function is somewhat limited in modeling natural phenomena, the negative exponential is quite useful. Looking back to

The behavior shown in the graph is quite useful for modeling radioactive decay,
processes of heating and cooling, and assimilation of medication in the bloodstream. Let’s look at an example.

3.1. EXPONENTIAL AND LOGISTIC APPLICATIONS

145

Example
If a patient is injected with 150 micrograms of medication, the amount of medication still in the bloodstream after t hours is given by the function:
A(t) = 150e−0.12t
a)

Find the amount of medication in the bloodstream after 3 hours.
Round your answer to the nearest 100th.

b)

How long will it take for the amount of medication to reach 60 micrograms?
Round your answer to the nearest 10th of an hour.

In this section we will focus on solving these problems using the graphing calculator. In later sections, we will cover processes that can be used to solve these
problems algebraically. It is helpful to understand both methods of solution.
First, let’s graph the function given in the problem:

We can see that after 3 hours there are approximately 104.65 micrograms of medication in the patient’s bloodstream.
To answer part (b) graphically, we’ll graph the original function along with the
horizontal line y = 60. When we find the intersection of these two graphs, we’ll
know how long it takes for there to be 60 micrograms of medication in the patient’s bloodstream:

What is the deer population after 10 years?
Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

c)

How long does it take for the population to reach 5,000?

Parts (a) and (b) can both be answered from a table of values for the function.
Before we look at the table, let’s consider the question in Part (a). The problem is
asking what the initial population of deer was. The means that we’re looking to
find out what y is when t = 0.

3.2. LOGARITHMIC NOTATION

3.2

157

Logarithmic Notation

A Logarithm is an exponent. In the early 1600’s, the Scottish mathematician John
Napier devised a method of expressing numbers in terms of their powers of ten
in order simplify calculation. Since the advent of digital calculators, the methods
of calculation using logarithms have become obsolete, however the concept of
logarithms continues to be used in many area of mathematics.
The fundamental idea of logarithmic notation is that it is simply a restatement of
an exponential relationship. The definition of a logarithm says:
logb N = x → bx = N
The notation above would be read as ”log to the base b of N equals x means that
b to the x power equals N .” In this section we will focus mainly on becoming
familiar with this notation. In later sections, we will learn to use this process to
solve equations.
Example
Express the given statement using exponential notation:
log2 32 = 5
If log2 32 = 5, then 25 = 32.

Example
Express the given statement using exponential notation:
log7 4 ≈ 0.7124
If log7 4 ≈ 0.7124, then 70.7124 ≈ 4

If the logarithm notation appears without a base, it is usually assumed that the
base should be 10.

158

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

Example
Express the given statement using exponential notation:
log 100 = 2
If log 100 = 2, then 102 = 100

The notation ln N = x is typically used to indicate a logrithm to the base e. This
means that:
ln N = x → ex = N
Example
Express the given statement using exponential notation:
ln 15 ≈ 2.708
If ln 15 ≈ 2.708, then e2.708 ≈ 15

In some cases, we would want to change an exponential statement into a logarithmic statement.

Exmple
Express the given statement using logarithmic notation:
124 = 20, 736
If 124 = 20, 736 then log12 20, 736 = 4

Solving Exponential Equations

Because of the fact that logarithms are exponents, the rules for working with
logarithms are similar to those that govern exponential expressions. One very
helpful rule of equality for working with logarithms is related to the exponential
rule for raising a power to a power. We recall one of the rules of exponents as:
(bx )y = bx∗y
in other words
(52 )4 = (52 )(52 )(52 )(52 ) = 52∗4 = 58

In logarithmic notation, this rule works out as:
logb M p = p ∗ logb M

The reason for this comes from the rule for exponents. Lets’ say that logb M = x.

Then:
logb M = x
this means that
bx = M
and
(bx )p = (M )p
so
bp∗x = M p

162

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

Now, we come back to the question of logb M p =?. This expression (logb M p ) is
asking the question ”What power do we raise b to in order to get an answer of
M p ? The result on the previous page shows that:
bpx = M p
This means that we must raise b to the px power to get an answer of M p . Remember that x = logb M . This means that:
bpx = M p
so
logb M p = px = p ∗ logb M
This statement of equality is useful if we are trying to solve equations in which
the variable is an exponent.
Example
Solve for x.
4x = 53
We start by taking a logarithm on both of the equation. Just as we can add to both
sides of an equation, or multiply on both sides of an equation, or raise both sides
of an equation to a power, we can also take the logarithm of both sides. So long
as two quantities are equal, then their logarithms will also be equal.
4x = 53
log 4x = log 53
x log 4 = log 53

x=

log 53
≈ 2.864
log 4

3.3. SOLVING EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS

163

Since the log base 10 and log base e are both programmed into most calculators,
these are the most commonly used bases for logarithms.
Example
Solve for x.
52x+3 = 17
We start this problem in the same fashion, but this time we will use a logarithm
to the base e:
52x+3 = 17
ln 52x+3 = ln 17
(2x + 3) ln 5 = ln 17
There are several possibilities for finishing the problem from this point. We will
focus on two of them that are the most useful for solving more complex problems.
First, we will distribute the ln 5 into the parentheses and then get the x by itself.
(2x + 3) ln 5 = ln 17
x ∗ 2 ln 5 + 3 ln 5 = ln 17
−3 ln 5 = −3 ln 5
x ∗ 2 ln 5 = ln 17 − 3 ln 5

x=

ln 17 − 3 ln 5
≈ −0.620
2 ln 5

And we can check the answer by plugging it back in:
52∗(−0.0620)+3 ≈ 51.760 ≈ 16.9897 ≈ 17

164

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

We can also approximate the logarithms in the problem and solve for an approximate answer:
(2x + 3) ln 5 = ln 17
x ∗ 2 ln 5 + 3 ln 5 = ln 17
3.2189x + 4.8283 ≈ 2.8332
−4.8283 ≈ −4.8283
3.2189x ≈ −1.9951
x ≈ −0.620
If you use the method of approximating, it’s important to make a good approximation. At least 4-5 decimal places are necessary for an accurate answer.
Let’s look at an example that has variables on both sides of the equation:
Example
Solve for x.
43x = 92x−1
We’ll use log base 10 in this problem.
43x = 92x−1
log 43x = log 92x−1
3x ∗ log 4 = (2x − 1) log 9
x ∗ 3 log 4 = x ∗ 2 log 9 − log 9

3.3. SOLVING EXPONENTIAL EQUATIONS

165

If we collect like terms, we’ll end up with:
x ∗ 3 log 4 = x ∗ 2 log 9 − log 9
log 9 = x ∗ 2 log 9 − x ∗ 3 log 4

At this point, if we want to get the x by itself, we need to factor out the x on the
right-hand side:
log 9 = x ∗ 2 log 9 − x ∗ 3 log 4
log 9 = x(2 log 9 − 3 log 4)

Then divide on both sides by the coefficient in parentheses:
((

2 log 9 − 3 log 4
((9 − 3 log 4
(

log 9
=x
2 log 9 − 3 log 4
9.327 ≈ x
Again, we can check our answer by plugging it back into the equation:

43∗9.327 ≈ 427.981 ≈ 7.0184 ∗ 1016
92∗9.327−1 ≈ 917.654 ≈ 7.0177 ∗ 1016

166

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

We could also have solved this equation by approximating the logarithms in the
beginning.
43x = 92x−1
log 43x = log 92x−1
3x ∗ log 4 = (2x − 1) log 9
3x(0.60206) ≈ (2x − 1)0.95424
1.80618x ≈ 1.9085x − 0.95424
0.95424 ≈ 0.10232x
9.326 ≈ x
This answer is less accurate than the other approximation (9.326036 vs. 9.327424).
The accuracy of an answer depends upon the original approximations for the
logarithms.

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

Solving Logarithmic Equations

In the previous section, we took exponential equations and used the properties of
logarithms to restate them as logarithmic equations. In this section, we will take
logarithmic equations and use properties of logarithms to restate them as exponential equations. In the previous section, we used the property of logarithms
that said logb M p = p logb M . In this section, we will make use of two additional
properties of logarithms:
logb (M ∗ N ) = logb M + logb N

and

logb

M
N

= logb M − logb N

Just as our previous property of logarithms was simply a restatement of the rules
of expoenents, these two properties of logarithms depend on the rules of exponents as well. Since we’re interested in logb M and logb N , let’s restate these in
terms of exponents:
If logb M = x then bx = M and if logb N = y then by = N
The properties of logarithms we’re interested in justifying have to do with M ∗ N
, so let’s look at those expressions in terms of exponents:
and M
N
M ∗ N = bx ∗ by = bx+y
and
bx
M
= y = bx−y
N
b
If we’re interested in logb (M ∗ N ), then we’re asking the question ”What power
do we raise b to in order to get M ∗ N ?” We can see above that raising b to the
x + y power gives us M ∗ N . Since x = logb M and y = logb N then x + y =
logb M + logb N , so:
logb (M ∗ N ) = x + y = logb M + logb N
Likewise, if we’re interested in logb M
, we’re asking the question ”What power
N
M
do we raise b to in order to get N ?” Since raising b to the x − y power gives us M
N
and x − y = logb M − logb N , then:
logb

M
N

= x − y = logb M − logb N

3.4. SOLVING LOGARITHMIC EQUATIONS

169

Let’s look at an example to see how we’ll use this to solve equations:
Example
Solve for x.
log2 x + log2 (x − 4) = 2
The first thing we can do here is to combine the two logarithmic statements
into


one. Since logb (M ∗ N ) = logb M + logb N , then log2 x + log2 (x − 4) = log2 x(x − 4) .
log2 x + log2 (x − 4) = 2


log2 x(x − 4) = 2
Then we’ll restate the resulting logarithmic relationship as an exponential relationship:
22 = x(x − 4)
4 = x2 − 4x
0 = x2 − 4x − 4
4.828, −0.828 ≈ x
Most textbooks reject answers that result in taking the logarithm of a negative
number, such as would be the case for x ≈ −0.828. However, the logarithms of
negative numbers result in complex valued answers, rather than an undefined
quantity. For that reason, in this text, we will include all answers.

170

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

If a problem involves a difference of logarithms, we can use the other property of
logarithms introduced in this section.
Example
Solve for x.
log(5x − 1) − log(x − 2) = 2
Again, our first step is to restate the difference of logarithms using the property
= logb M − logb N :
logb M
N
log(5x − 1) − log(x − 2) = 2



5x − 1

We’re working with a logarithm in base 10 in this problem, so in our next step
we’ll say:



5x − 1
log
=2
x−2
5x − 1
= 102
x−2
Then multiply on both sides by x − 2:

And, solve for x
100x − 200 = 5x − 1

x=

In some equations, all of the terms are stated using logartihms. These equations
often come out in a form that says logb x = logb y. If this is the case, we can then
conclude that x = y.
It seems reasonable that if the exponent we raise b to in order to get x is the same
exponent that we raise b to in order to get y, then x and y are the same thing.
Assume:
logb x = logb y
Let’s say that logb x = a = logb y
then
ba = x and ba = y
if both x and y are equal to ba , then x = y
Example
Solve for x.
log5 (4 − x) = log5 (x + 8) + log5 (2x + 13)

172

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

First, let’s use the properties of logarithms to restate the equation so that there is
only one logarithm on each side.
log5 (4 − x) = log5 (x + 8) + log5 (2x + 13)


log5 (4 − x) = log5 (x + 8)(2x + 13)
Then, we’ll use the property of logarithms we just discussed:
If logb x = logb y
then
x=y


log5 (4 − x) = log5 (x + 8)(2x + 13)
4 − x = (x + 8)(2x + 13)

At the beginning of Chapter 3, we worked with application problems and solved
them using the graphing calculator. In this section, we will revisit some of these
application problems and use the solution methods discussed in the previous
sections to solve these problems algebraically.

Radioactive Decay
The decay of a radioactive element into its non-radioactive form occurs following
a time line dictated by the ”half-life” of the element. The half-life is the amount
of time that it takes for half of the existing radioactive material to decay to its
non-radioactive form.
Consider the equation:
A(t) = A0 e−kt

where A(t) is the amount of material left at time t, A0 is the amount present at
t = 0, and k is a constant that can be determined based on the half-life of the
material.
If we know that after one half-life, there will 50% of the radioactive material remaining, then we can say that:
0.5A0 = A0 e−kth

where th is the half-life. To solve this equation for k, we would first divide on
both sides by A0 :
A0 e−kth
0.5A0
=
A0
A0
0.5 = e−kth

176

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

Then take the natural logarithm of both sides and bring the exponent down in
front of the expression as a coefficient:
0.5 = e−kth
ln(0.5) = ln(e−kth )
ln(0.5) = −kth ∗ ln(e)
ln(0.5) = −kth ∗ 1

−

ln(0.5)
=k
th

The value of k can then be used in the equation A(t) = A0 e−kt to determine the
amount of material left after any time t.
Example
The isotope Gold-198 (198 Au) is a type of gold sometimes used in medical applications and has a half-life of 2.7 days. How much of a 65 gram sample of 198 Au
will be left after 6 days? How long would it take for there to be 10 grams left?
If we know the half-life, we can calculate the value of the constant k.

k=−

k=−

ln(0.5)
2.7

k ≈ 0.2567

3.5. APPLICATIONS OF THE NEGATIVE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION

177

Now that we know the value of k, we can directly calculate the amount of 198 Au
left after 6 days:
A(t) = A0 e−kt
= 65e−0.2567∗6
≈ 13.932
So, approximately 13.932 grams of 198 Au would be left after 6 days.
In order to calculate how long it takes for 10 grams of 198 Au to be left, we’ll need
to solve for t in the equation A(t) = A0 e−kt with A(t) = 10:
A(t) = A0 e−kt
10 = 65e−0.2567t
First, we’ll divide on both sides by 65:

65e
10 
=

65
65


10
= e−0.2567t

Then, take the natural logarithm on both sides:

We’ll calculate an approximate value for ln 10
and restate the right hand side of
65
the equation using the properties of logarithms:
−1.872 ≈ −0.2567t ∗ ln e
−1.872 ≈ −0.2567t ∗ 1
−1.872 ≈ −0.2567t
7.3 ≈ t
So, it would take about 7.3 days for the 65 grams of 198 Au to decay to 10 grams.

Newton’s Law of Cooling
Newton’s Law of Cooling states that the temperature of an object can be determined using the equation:
T = Ta + Ce−kt
where Ta is the ambient temperature of the surrounding environment. The values
of the constants C and k can often be calculated from given information.
Example
A bottle of soda at room temperature (72◦ F) is placed in a refrigerator where the
temperature is 44◦ F.
After half an hour, the soda has cooled to 61◦ F. What is the temperature of the
soda after another half hour?
First, since the soda is placed in the refrigerator where the ambient temperature is
44◦ F, then Ta = 44. We also know that at t = 0, T = 72, which is the temperature of
the soda can when it is first put in the refrigerator. This will allow us to calculate
the constant C.

3.5. APPLICATIONS OF THE NEGATIVE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION

179

T = Ta + Ce−kt
72 = 44 + Ce−k∗0
72 = 44 + Ce0 = 44 + C ∗ 1
72 = 44 + C
28 = C
Now we know that Ta = 44 and C = 28. We can use the other piece of information
from the problem to calculate the value of k. The problem states that after 30
minutes the soda has cooled off to 61◦ F. That means that when t = 30 (or t = 0.5
depending on which units you choose) the temperature T will be 61◦ F. We can
then set up the equation to reflect this and calculate the vlaue of k:
T = 44 + 28e−kt
61 = 44 + 28e−k∗30
First, we’ll subtract 44 on both sides and divide by 28:
61 = 44 + 28e−k∗30
17 = 28e−30k
17
= e−30k
28

180

CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS AND LOGARITHMS

Now, we’ll take the natural logarithm on both sides to bring the −30k down from
the exponent:

−0.499 ≈ −30k
0.01663 ≈ k
Now, we have the full formula for calculating temperature in this scenario:
T = 44 + 28e−0.01663t

To find out what happens after 60 minutes, we can simply plug in 60 for t:
T = 44 + 28e−0.01663t
T = 44 + 28e−0.01663∗60
T = 44 + 28e−0.9978
T ≈ 44 + 28 ∗ 0.3687
T ≈ 44 + 10.3236 ≈ 54.3◦ F
