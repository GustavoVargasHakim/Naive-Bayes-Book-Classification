Preface
This book consists of ten weeks of material given as a course on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for second year mathematics majors
at the University of Bristol. It is the first course devoted solely to differential equations that these students will take. An obvious question
is “why does there need to be another textbook on ODEs”? From one
point of view the answer is certainly that it is not needed. The classic
textbooks of Coddington and Levinson, Hale, and Hartman1 provide a
thorough exposition of the topic and are essential references for mathematicians, scientists and engineers who encounter and must understand ODEs in the course of their research. However, these books are
not ideal for use as a textbook for a student’s first exposure to ODEs
beyond the basic calculus course (more on that shortly). Their depth
and mathematical thoroughness often leave students that are relatively
new to the topic feeling overwhelmed and grasping for the essential
ideas within the topics that are covered. Of course, (probably) no one
would consider using these texts for a second year course in ODEs.
That’s not really an issue, and there is a large market for ODE texts for
second year mathematics students (and new texts continue to appear
each year). I spent some time examining some of these texts (many
which sell for well over a hundred dollars) and concluded that none of
them really would ‘’work” for the course that I wanted to deliver. So,
I decided to write my own notes, which have turned into this small
book. I have taught this course for three years now. There are typically about 160 students in the class, in their second year, and I have
been somewhat surprised, and pleased, by how the course has been received by the students. So now I will explain a bit about my rationale,
requirements and goals for the course.
In the UK students come to University to study mathematics with
a good background in calculus and linear algebra. Many have ‘’seen”
some basic ODEs already. In their first year students have a year long
course in calculus where they encounter the typical first order ODEs,
second order linear constant coefficient ODEs, and two dimensional
first order linear matrix ODEs. This material tends to form a substantial part of the traditional second year course in ODEs and since

I can consider the material as ‘’already seen, at least, once”, it allows
me to develop the course in a way that makes contact with more contemporary concepts in ODEs and to touch on a variety of research
issues. This is very good for our program since many students will do
substantial projects that approach research level and require varying
amounts of knowledge of ODEs.
This book consists of 10 chapters, and the course is 12 weeks long.
Each chapter is covered in a week, and in the remaining two weeks I
summarize the entire course, answer lots of questions, and prepare the
students for the exam. I do not cover the material in the appendices in
the lectures. Some of it is basic material that the students have already
seen that I include for completeness and other topics are ‘’tasters” for
more advanced material that students will encounter in later courses
or in their project work. Students are very curious about the notion
of ‘’chaos”, and I have included some material in an appendix on that
concept. The focus in that appendix is only to connect it with ideas that
have been developed in this course related to ODEs and to prepare
them for more advanced courses in dynamical systems and ergodic
theory that are available in their third and fourth years.
There is a significant transition from first to second year mathematics at Bristol. For example, the first year course in calculus teaches a
large number of techniques for performing analytical computations,
e.g. the usual set of tools for computing derivatives and integrals of
functions of one, and more variables. Armed with a large set of computational skills, the second year makes the transition to ‘’thinking
about mathematics” and ‘’creating mathematics”. The course in ODEs
is ideal for making this transition. It is a course in ordinary differential ‘’equations”, and equations are what mathematicians learn how to
solve. It follows then that students take the course with the expectation of learning how to solve ODEs. Therefore it is a bit disconcerting
when I tell them that it is likely that almost all of the ODEs that they
encounter throughout their career as a mathematician will not have analytical solutions. Moreover, even if they do have analytical solutions
the complexity of the analytical solutions, even for ‘’simple” ODEs, is
not likely to yield much insight into the nature of the behavior of the
solutions of ODEs. This last statement provides the entry into the nature of the course, which is based on the ‘’vision of Poincaré”–rather
than seeking to find specific solutions of ODEs, we seek to understand
how all possible solutions are related in their behavior in the geometrical setting of phase space. In other words, this course has been designed to be a beginning course in ODEs from the dynamical systems
point of view.
I am grateful to all of the students who have taken this course over
the past three years. Teaching the course was a very rewarding expe-

11

rience for me and I very much enjoyed discussing this material with
them in weekly office hours.
This book was typeset with the Tufte latex package. I am grateful to
Edward R. Tufte for realizing his influential design ideas in this Latex
book package.

1
Getting Started: The Language of ODEs

This is a course about ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
So we begin by defining what we mean by this term1 .
Definition 1 (Ordinary differential equation). An ordinary differential
equation (ODE) is an equation for a function of one variable that involves
(‘’ordinary”) derivatives of the function (and, possibly, known functions of
the same variable).
We give several examples below.

ODEs can be succinctly written by adopting a more compact notation for the derivatives. We rewrite the examples above with this
shorthand notation.

The material in these lectures can be
found in most textbooks on ODEs. It
consists mainly of terminology and definitions. Generally such “defintion and
terminology” introductions can be tedious and a bit boring. We probably
have not entirely avoided that trap, but
the material does introduce much of the
essential language and some concepts
that permeate the rest of the course. If
you skip it, you will need to come back
to it.

14

ordinary differential equations

Now that we have defined the notion of an ODE, we will need to
develop some additional concepts in order to more deeply describe the
structure of ODEs. The notions of ‘’structure” are important since we
will see that they play a key role in how we understand the nature of
the behavior of solutions of ODEs.
Definition 2 (Dependent variable). The value of the function, e.g for example 1, x (t).
Definition 3 (Independent variable). The argument of the function, e.g
for example 1, t.
We summarize a list of the dependent and independent variables in
the five examples of ODEs given above.

Table 1.1: Identifying the independent
and dependent variables for several examples.

The notion of ‘’order” is an important characteristic of ODEs.
Definition 4 (Order of an ODE). The number associated with the largest
derivative of the dependent variable in the ODE.
We give the order of each of the ODEs in the five examples above.

Distinguishing between the independent and dependent variables
enables us to define the notion of autonomous and nonautonomous
ODEs.
Definition 5 (Autonomous, Nonautonomous). An ODE is said to be autonomous if none of the coefficients (i.e. functions) multiplying the dependent variable, or any of its derivatives, depend explicitly on the independent
variable, and also if no terms not depending on the dependent variable or any
of it derivatives depend explicitly on the independent variable. Otherwise, it
is said to be nonautonomous.

Table 1.2: Identifying the order of the
ODE for several examples.

getting started: the language of odes

15

Or, more succinctly, an ODE is autonomous if the independent variable does not explicitly appear in the equation. Otherwise, it is nonautonomous.
We apply this definition to the five examples above, and summarize
the results in the table below.

All scalar ODEs, i.e. the value of the dependent variable is a scalar,
can be written as first order equations where the new dependent variable is a vector having the same dimension as the order of the ODE.
This is done by constructing a vector whose components consist of the
dependent variable and all of its derivatives below the highest order.
This vector is the new dependent variable. We illustrate this for the
five examples above.

where x (t0 ) ⌘ x0 is referred to as the initial condition.

getting started: the language of odes

This first order vector form of ODEs allows us to discuss many
properties of ODEs in a way that is independent of the order of the
ODE. It also lends itself to a natural geometrical description of the
solutions of ODEs that we will see shortly.
A key characteristic of ODEs is whether or not they are 2 linear or
3 nonlinear.

17

Definition 6 (Linear and Nonlinear ODEs). An ODE is said to be linear
if it is a linear function of the dependent variable. If it is not linear, it is said
to be nonlinear.
Note that the independent variable does not play a role in whether
or not the ODE is linear or nonlinear.

When written as a first order vector equation the (vector) space of
dependent variables is referred to as the phase space of the ODE. The
ODE then has the geometric interpretation as a vector field on phase
space. The structure of phase space, e.g. its dimension and geometry,
can have a significant influence on the nature of solutions of ODEs. We
will encounter ODEs defined on different types of phase space, and of
different dimensions. Some examples are given in the following lists.
1-dimension
1. R –the real line,
2. I ⇢ R –an interval on the real line,
3. S1 –the circle.
‘’Solving” One dimensional Autonomous ODEs. Formally (we will explain what that means shortly) an expression for the solution of a one
dimensional autonomous ODE can be obtained by integration. We
explain how this is done, and what it means. Let P denote one of
the one dimensional phase spaces described above. We consider the
autonomous vector field defined on P as follows:
ẋ =

dx
= f ( x ),
dt

x ( t0 ) = x0 ,

x 2 P.

(1.3)

This is an example of a one dimensional separable ODE which can be
written as follows:
Z x (t)
dx 0
x ( t0 )

f ( x0 )

=

Z t
t0

dt0 = t

t0 .

(1.4)

If we can compute the integral on the left hand side of (1.4), then it may
be possible to solve for x (t). However, we know that not all functions
1
can be integrated. This is what we mean by we can ‘’formally”
f (x)
solve for the solution for this example. We may not be able to represent
the solution in a form that is useful.
The higher dimensional phase spaces that we will consider will be
constructed as Cartesian products of these three basic one dimensional
phase spaces.
2-dimensions
1. R2 = R ⇥ R–the plane,
2. T2 = S ⇥ S–the two torus,
3. C = I ⇥ S– the (finite) cylinder,
4. C = R ⇥ S– the (infinite) cylinder.
In many applications of ODEs the independent variable has the interpretation of time, which is why the variable t is often used to denote the independent variable. Dynamics is the study of how systems
change in time. When written as a first order system ODEs are often
referred to as dynamical systems, and ODEs are said to generate vector
fields on phase space. For this reason the phrases ODE and vector field
tend to be used synonomously.
Several natural questions arise when analysing an ODE . ‘’Does the
ODE have a solution?” ‘’Are solutions unique?” (And what does
‘’unique” mean?) The standard way of treating this in an ODE course
is to “prove a big theorem” about existence and uniqueness. Rather,
than do that (you can find the proof in hundreds of books, as well as
in many sites on the internet), we will consider some examples that
illustrate the main issues concerning what these questions mean, and
afterwards we will describe sufficent conditions for an ODE to have a
unique solution (and then consider what ‘’uniqueness” means).
First, do ODEs have solutions? Not necessarily, as the following
example shows.
Example 1 (An example of an ODE that has no solutions.). Consider
the following ODE defined on R:

getting started: the language of odes

ẋ2 + x2 + t2 =

1,

x 2 R.

This ODE has no solutions since the left hand side is nonnegative and the
right hand side is strictly negative.
Then you can ask the question–”if the ODE has solutions, are they
unique?” Again, the answer is ‘’not necessarily”, as the following example shows.
Example 2 (An example illustrating the meaning of uniqueness).
x 2 Rn ,

ẋ = ax,

(1.5)

where a is an arbitrary constant. The solution is given by
x (t) = ce at .

(1.6)

So we see that there are an infinite number of solutions, depending upon the
choice of the constant c. So what could uniqueness of solutions mean? If we
evaluate the solution (1.6) at t = 0 we see that
x (0) = c.

(1.7)

Substituting this into the solution (1.6), the solution has the form:
x (t) = x (0)e at .

(1.8)

From the form of (1.8) we can see exactly what ‘’uniquess of solutions” means.
For a given initial condition, there is exactly one solution of the ODE satisfying that initial condition.
Example 3. An example of an ODE with non-unique solutions.
Consider the following ODE defined on R:
2

ẋ = 3x 3 ,

x (0) = 0, x 2 R.

(1.9)

It is easy to see that a solution satisfying x (0) = 0 is x = 0. However, one
can verify directly by substituting into the equation that the following is also
a solution satisfying x (0) = 0:
x (t) =

(

0,
(t

ta
a )3 , t > a

(1.10)

for any a > 0. Hence, in this example, there are an infinite number of
solutions satisfying the same initial condition. This example illustrates
precisely what we mean by uniqueness. Given an initial condition, only one
(‘’uniqueness”) solution satisfies the initial condition at the chosen initial
time.

19

20

ordinary differential equations

There is another question that comes up. If we have a unique solution does it exist for all time? Not necessarily, as the following example
shows.
Example 4. An example of an ODE with unique solutions that exists only
for a finite time.
Consider the following ODE on R:
ẋ = x2

x (0) = x0 , x 2 R.

(1.11)

We can easily integrate this equation (it is separable) to obtain the following
solution satisfying the initial condition:
x (t) =

x0
1 x0 t

(1.12)

The solution becomes infinite, or ‘’does not exist” or ‘’blows up” at xt0 . This
is what ‘’does not exist” means. So the solution only exists for a finite time,
and this ‘’time of existence” depends on the initial condition.
These three examples contain the essence of the ‘’existence issues”
for ODEs that will concern us. They are the ‘’standard examples” that
can be found in many textbooks4 .5
Now we will state the standard ‘’existence and uniqueness” theorem for ODEs. The statement is an example of the power and flexibility of expressing a general ODE as a first order vector equation. The
statement is valid for any (finite) dimension.
We consider the general vector field on R n
ẋ = f ( x, t), x (t0 ) = x0 ,

x 2 Rn .

(1.13)

It is important to be aware that for the general result we are going
to state it does not matter whether or not the ODE is autonomous or
nonautonomous.
We define the domain of the vector field. Let U ⇢ R n be an open set
and let I ⇢ R be an interval. Then we express that the n-dimensional
vector field is defined on this domain as follows:

f : U⇥I

! Rn ,

( x, t) !

f ( x, t)

(1.14)

We need a definition to describe the ‘’regularity” of the vector field.
Definition 7 (Cr function). We say that f ( x, t) is Cr on U ⇥ I ⇢ R n ⇥ R
if it is r times differentiable and each derivative is a continuous function (on
the same domain). If r = 0, f ( x, t) is just said to be continuous.

The ‘’Existence and Uniqueness Theorem” is, traditionally, a standard part
of ODE courses beyond the elementary
level. This theorem, whose proof can
be found in numerous texts (including
those mentioned in the Preface), will not
be given in this course. There are several reasons for this. One is that it requires considerable time to construct a
detailed and careful proof, and I do not
feel that this is the best use of time in a 12
week course. The other reason (not unrelated to the first) is that I do not feel that
the understanding of the detailed ‘’Existence and Uniqueness” proof is particularly important at this stage of the students education. The subject has grown
so much in the last forty years, especially
with the merging of the ‘’dynamical systems point of view” with the subject of
ODEs, that there is just not enough time
to devote to all the topics that students
‘’should know”. However, it is important to know what it means for an ODE
to have a solution, what uniqueness of
solutions means, and general conditions
for when an ODE has unique solutions.

getting started: the language of odes

Now we can state sufficient conditions for (1.13) to have a unique solution. We suppose that f ( x, t) is Cr , r
1. We choose any point
( x0 , t0 ) 2 U ⇥ I. Then there exists a unique solution of (1.13) satisfying
this initial condition. We denote this solution by x (t, t0 , x0 ), and reflect
in the notation that it satisfies the initial condition by x (t0 , t0 , x0 ) = x0 .
This unique solution exists for a time interval centered at the initial
time t0 , denoted by (t0 e, t0 + e), for some e > 0. Moreover, this
solution, x (t, t0 , x0 ), is a Cr function of t, t0 , x0 . Note that from Example 4 e may depend on x0 . This also explains how a solution ‘’fails to
exist”–it becomes unbounded (‘’blow up”) in a finite time.
Finally, we remark that existence and uniqueness of ODEs is the
mathematical manifestation of determinism. If the initial condition
is specified (with 100% accuracy), then the past and the future is
uniquely determined. The key phrase here is ‘’100% accuracy”. Numbers cannot be specified with 100% accuracy. There will always be
some imprecision in the specification of the initial condition. Chaotic
dynamical systems are deterministic dynamical systems having the
property that imprecisions in the initial conditions may be magnified
by the dynamical evolution, leading to seemingly random behavior
(even though the system is completely deterministic).

Does this vector field have unique solutions? 6
3. Consider the vector field:
ẋ =

Example 3. The point of this exercise is
to think about how issues of existence

6

x 2 R.

Determine sufficient conditions on the coefficients a(t) and b(t) for
which the solutions will exist for all time. Do the results depend on
the initial condition? 8

7

Here is the point of this exercise: ẋ =
x has solutions that exist for all time
(for any initial condition), ẋ = x2 has
solutions that ‘’blow up in finite time”.
What happens when you ‘’put these
two together”? In order to answer this
you will need to solve for the solution,
x (t, x0 ).

8

The ‘’best” existence and uniqueness
theorems are when you can analytically
solve for the ‘’exact” solution of an ODE
for arbitrary initial conditions. This is
the type of ODE where that can be done.
It is a first order, linear inhomogeneous
ODE that can be solved using an ‘’integrating factor”. However, you will need
to argue that the integrals obtained from
this procedure ‘’make sense”.

Special Structure and Solutions of ODEs

A consistent theme throughout all of ODEs is that ‘’special structure” of the equations can reveal insight into the
nature of the solutions. Here we look at a very basic and important
property of autonomous equations:
‘’Time shifts of solutions of autonomous ODEs are also solutions of the ODE
(but with a different initial condition)”.

Now we will show how to see this.
Throughout this course we will assume that existence and
uniqueness of solutions holds on a domain and time interval sufficient for our arguments and calculations.
We start by establishing the setting. We consider an autonomous
vector field defined on R n :
ẋ = f ( x ), x (0) = x0 ,
with solution denoted by:
x (t, 0, x0 ),

x 2 Rn ,

(2.1)

x (0, 0, x0 ) = x0 .

Here we are taking the initial time to be t0 = 0. We will see, shortly,
that for autonomous equations this can be done without loss of generality. Now we choose s 2 R (s 6= 0, which is to be regarded as a fixed
constant). We must show the following:
ẋ (t + s) = f ( x (t + s))

(2.2)

This is what we mean by the phrase time shifts of solutions are solutions. This relation follows immediately from the chain rule calculation:
d
d
d(t + s)
d
=
=
.
dt
d(t + s)
dt
d(t + s)

(2.3)

24

ordinary differential equations

Finally, we need to determine the initial condition for the time shifted
solution. For the original solution we have:
x (t, 0, x0 ),

x (0, 0, x0 ) = x0 ,

(2.4)

and for the time shifted solution we have:
x (t + s, 0, x0 ),

x (s, 0, x0 ).

(2.5)

It is for this reason that, without loss of generality, for autonomous
vector fields we can take the initial time to be t0 = 0. This allows us
to simplify the arguments in the notation for solutions of autonomous
vector fields, i.e., x (t, 0, x0 ) ⌘ x (t, x0 ) with x (0, 0, x0 ) = x (0, x0 ) = x0
Example 5 (An example illustrating the time-shift property of autonomous vector fields.). Consider the following one dimensional autonomous
vector field:
ẋ = lx, x (0) = x0 ,

x 2 R, l 2 R.

(2.6)

The solution is given by:
x (t, 0, x0 ) = x (t, x0 ) = elt x0 .

(2.7)

The time shifted solution is given by:
x (t + s, x0 ) = el(t+s) x0 .

(2.8)

We see that it is a solution of the ODE with the following calculations:
d
x (t + s, x0 ) = lel(t+s) x0 = lx (t + s, x0 ),
dt
with initial condition:
x (s, x0 ) = els x0 .

(2.9)

(2.10)

In summary, we see that the solutions of autonomous vector fields
satisfy the following three properties:
1. x (0, x0 ) = x0
2. x (t, x0 ) is Cr in x0
3. x (t + s, x0 ) = x (t, x (s, x0 ))
Property one just reflects the notation we have adopted. Property 2
is a statement of the properties arising from existence and uniqueness
of solutions. Property 3 uses two characteristics of solutions. One is
the ‘’time shift” property for autonomous vector fields that we have
proven. The other is ‘’uniquess of solutions” since the left hand side

special structure and solutions of odes

and the right hand side of Property 3 satisfy the same initial condition
at t = 0.
These three properties are the defining properties of a flow, i.e., a
. In other words, we view the solutions as defining a map of points
in phase space. The group property arises from property 3, i.e., the
time-shift property. In order to emphasise this ‘’map of phase space”
property we introduce a general notation for the flow as follows
x (t, x0 ) ⌘ ft (·),
where the ‘’·” in the argument of ft (·) reflects the fact that the flow is
a function on the phase space. With this notation the three properties
of a flow are written as follows:
1. f0 (·) is the identity map.
2. ft (·) is Cr for each t
3. ft+s (·) = ft

fs (·)

We often use the phrase ‘’the flow generated by the (autonomous) vector field”. Autonomous is in parentheses as it is understood that when
we are considering flows then we are considering the solutions of autonomous vector fields. This is because nonautonomous vector fields
do not necessarily satisfy the time-shift property, as we now show with
an example.
Example 6 (An example of a nonautonomous vector field not having
the time-shift property.). Consider the following one dimensional vector
field on R:
ẋ = ltx,

x (0) = x0 ,

x 2 R, l 2 R.

This vector field is separable and the solution is easily found to be:
l 2

x (t, 0, x0 ) = x0 e 2 t .
The time shifted ‘’solution” is given by:
2

l

x (t + s, 0, x0 ) = x0 e 2 (t+s) .
We show that this does not satisfy the vector field with the following calculation:
d
x (t + s, 0, x0 )
dt

=

l

2

x0 e 2 ( t + s ) l ( t + s ).

6= ltx (t + s, 0, x0 ).

25

26

ordinary differential equations

Perhaps a more simple example illustrating that nonautonomous
vector fields do not satisfy the time-shift property is the following.
Example 7. Consider the following one dimensional nonautonomous vector
field:
ẋ = et ,

x 2 R.

The solution is given by:
x (t) = et .
It is easy to verify that the time-shifted function:
x (t + s ) = et+s ,
does not satisfy the equation.
In the study of ODEs certain types of solutions have achieved a level
of prominence largely based on their significance in applications. They
are
• equilibrium solutions,
• periodic solutions,
• heteroclinic solutions,
• homoclinic solutions.
We define each of these.
Definition 8 (Equilibrium). A point in phase space x = x̄ = R n that is a
solution of the ODE , i.e.
f ( x̄ ) = 0,

f ( x̄, t) = 0,

is called an equilibrium point.
For example, x = 0 is an equilibrium point for the following autonomous and nonautonomous one dimensional vector fields, respectively,

ẋ

=

x,

ẋ

= tx,

x 2 R,

x 2 R.

A periodic solution is simply a solution that is periodic in time.
Its definition is the same for both autonomous and nonautonomous
vector fields.

special structure and solutions of odes

27

Definition 9 (Periodic solutions). A solution x (t, t0 , x0 ) is periodic if there
exists a T > 0 such that
x (t, t0 , x0 ) = x (t + T, t0 , x0 )
Homoclinic and heteroclinic solutions are important in a variety of
applications. Their definition is not so simple as the definitions of
equilibrium and periodic solutions since they can be defined and generalized to many different settings. We will only consider these special solutions for autonomous vector fields, and solutions homoclinic
or heteroclinic to equilibrium solutions.
Definition 10 (Homoclinic and Heteroclinic Solutions). Suppose x̄1 and
x̄2 are equilibrium points of an autonomous vector field, i.e.
f ( x̄1 ) = 0,

f ( x̄2 ) = 0.

A trajectory x (t, t0 , x0 ) is said to be heteroclinic to x̄1 and x̄2 if

lim x (t, t0 , x0 )

= x̄2 ,

lim x (t, t0 , x0 )

= x̄1

t!•

t! •

(2.11)

If x̄1 = x̄2 the trajectory is said to be homoclinic to x̄1 = x̄2 .
Example 8. 1
Here we give an example illustrating equilibrium points and heteroclinic
orbits. Consider the following one dimensional autonomous vector field on R:
ẋ = x

x 3 = x (1

x 2 ),

x 2 R.

(2.12)

This vector field has three equilibrium points at x = 0, ±1.
In Fig. 2.1 we show the graph of the vector field (2.12) in panel a) and the
phase line dynamics in panel b).
The solid black dots in panel b) correspond to the equilibrium points and
these, in turn, correspond to the zeros of the vector field shown in panel a).
Between its zeros, the vector field has a fixed sign (i.e. positive or negative),
corresponding to ẋ being either increasing or decreasing. This is indicated by
the direction of the arrows in panel b).
Our discussion about trajectories, as well as this example, brings
us to a point where it is natural to introduce the important notion
of an invariant set. While this is a general idea that applies to both
autonomous and nonautonomous systems, in this course we will only
discuss this notion in the context of autonomous systems. Accordingly,
let ft (·) denote the flow generated by an autonomous vector field.

1

There is a question that we will return
to throughout this course. What does
it mean to ‘’solve” an ODE? We would
argue that a more ‘’practical” question
might be, ‘’what does it mean to understand the nature of all possible solutions
of an ODE?”. But don’t you need to be
able to answer the first question before
you can answer the second? We would
argue that Fig. 2.1 gives a complete
‘’qualitative” understanding of (2.12) in
a manner that is much simpler than one
could directly obtain from its solutions.
In fact, it would be an instructive exercise to first solve (2.12) and from the solutions sketch Fig. 2.1. This may seem
a bit confusing, but it is even more instructive to think about, and understand,
what it means.

Definition 11 (Invariant Set). A set M ⇢ R n is said to be invariant if
x 2 M ) ft ( x ) 2 M

8t.

In other words, a set is invariant (with respect to a flow) if you start
in the set, and remain in the set, forever.
If you think about it, it should be clear that invariant sets are sets of
trajectories. Any single trajectory is an invariant set. The entire phase
space is an invariant set. The most interesting cases are those “in
between”. Also, it should be clear that the union of any two invariant
sets is also an invariant set (just apply the definition of invariant set to
the union of two, or more, invariant sets).
There are certain situations where we will be interested in sets that
are invariant only for positive time–positive invariant sets.
Definition 12 (Positive Invariant Set). A set M ⇢ R n is said to be positive invariant if
x 2 M ) ft ( x ) 2 M

8t > 0.

There is a similar notion of negative invariant sets, but the generalization of this from the definition of positive invariant sets should be
obvious, so we will not write out the details.
Concerning example 8, the three equilibrium points are invariant
sets, as well as the closed intervals [ 1, 0] and [0, 1]. Are there other
invariant sets?

Problem Set 2

special structure and solutions of odes

1. Consider an autonomous vector field on the plane having a hyperbolic fixed point with a homoclinic orbit connecting the hyperbolic
fixed point, as illustrated in Fig. 1. We assume that existence and
uniqueness of solutions holds. Can a trajectory starting at any point
on the homoclinic orbit reach the hyperbolic fixed point in a finite
time? (You must justify your answer.)2

2. Can an autonomous vector field on R that has no equilibrium points
have periodic orbits? We assume that existence and uniqueness of

that an equilibrium point is a trajectory.

The main points to take into account in
this problem is that the phase space is R
and using this with the implication that
trajectories of autonomous ODEs ‘’cannot cross”.

It is probably easiest to answer this
problem by constructing a specific example.

Behavior Near Trajectories and Invariant Sets: Stability
Consider the general nonautonomous vector field in n dimensions:
ẋ = f ( x, t),

x 2 Rn ,

(3.1)

and let x̄ (t, t0 , x0 ) be a solution of this vector field.
Many questions in ODEs concern understanding the behavior of neighboring solutions near a given, chosen solution. We will develop the general framework for considering such
questions by transforming (3.1) to a form that allows us to explicitly
consider these issues.
We consider the following (time dependent) transformation of variables:
x = y + x̄ (t, t0 , x0 ).

(3.2)

We wish to express (3.1) in terms of the y variables. It is important to
understand what this will mean in terms of (3.2). For y small it means
that x is near the solution of interest, x̄ (t, t0 , x0 ). In other words, expressing the vector field in terms of y will provide us with an explicit
form of the vector field for studying the behavior near x̄ (t, t0 , x0 ). Towards this end, we begin by transforming (3.1) using (3.2) as follows:
ẋ = ẏ + x̄˙ = f ( x, t) = f (y + x̄, t),

(3.3)

or,
ẏ

=

f (y + x̄, t)

x̄˙ ,

=

f (y + x̄, t)

f ( x̄, t) ⌘ g(y, t),

g(0, t) = 0.

(3.4)

Hence, we have shown that solutions of (3.1) near x̄ (t, t0 , x0 ) are equivalent to solutions of (3.4) near y = 0.
The first question we want to ask related to the behavior near x̄ (t, t0 , x0 )
is whether or not this solution is stable? However, first we need to

32

ordinary differential equations

mathematically define what is meant by this term ‘’stable”. Now we
should know that, without loss of generality, we can discuss this question in terms of the zero solution of (3.4).
We begin by defining the notion of ‘’Lyapunov stability” (or just
‘’stability”).
Definition 13 (Lyapunov Stability). y = 0 is said to be Lyapunov stable
at t0 if given e > 0 there exists a d = d(t0 , e) such that

|y(t0 )| < d ) |y(t)| < e,

8 t > t0

(3.5)

If a solution is not Lyapunov stable, then it is said to be unstable.
Definition 14 (Unstable). If y = 0 is not Lyapunov stable, then it is said to
be unstable.
Then we have the notion of asymptotic stability.
Definition 15 (Asymptotic stability). y = 0 is said to be asymptotically
stable at t0 if:
1. it is Lyapunov stable at t0 ,
2. there exists d = d(t0 ) > 0 such that:

|y(t0 )| < d ) lim |y(t)| = 0
t!•

(3.6)

We have several comments about these definitions.
• Roughly speaking, a Lyapunov stable solution means that if you
start close to that solution, you stay close–forever. Asymptotic stability not only means that you start close and stay close forever, but
that you actually get ‘’closer and closer” to the solution.
• Stability is an infinite time concept.
• If the ODE is autonomous, then the quantity d = d(t0 , e) can be
chosen to be independent of t0 .
• The definitions of stability do not tell us how to prove that a solution
is stable (or unstable). We will learn two techniques for analyzing
this question–linearization and Lyapunov’s (second) method.
• Why is Lyapunov stability included in the definition of asymptotic
stability? Because it is possible to construct examples where nearby
solutions do get closer and closer to the given solution as t ! •, but
in the process there are intermediate intervals of time where nearby
solutions make ‘’large excursions” away from the given solution.

behavior near trajectories and invariant sets: stability

‘’Stability” is a notion that applies to a ‘’neighborhood” of a trajectory1 . At this point we want to formalize various notions related to
distance and neighborhoods in phase space. For simplicity in expressing these ideas we will take as our phase space R n . Points in this phase
space are denoted x 2 R n , x ⌘ ( x1 , . . . , xn ). The norm, or length, of x,
denoted | x | is defined as:

|x| =

q

x12 + x22 + · · · + xn2 =

Â xi2 .

i =1

is defined as:

y1 )2 + · · · + ( x n

y i )2 .

y n )2 ,
(3.7)

Distance between points in R n should be somewhat familiar, but
now we introduce a new concept, the distance between a point and a
set. Consider a set M, M ⇢ R n , let p 2 R n . Then the distance from p
to M is defined as follows:
dist( p, M ) ⌘ infx2 M | p

x |.

(3.8)

We remark that it follows from the definition that if p 2 M, then
dist( p, M ) = 0.
We have previously defined the notion of an invariant set. Roughly
speaking, invariant sets are comprised of trajectories. We now have
the background to discuss the notion of . Recall, that the notion of
invariant set was only developed for autonomous vector fields. So we
consider an autonomous vector field:
ẋ = f ( x ),

x 2 Rn ,

(3.9)

and denote the flow generated by this vector field by ft (·). Let M be
a closed invariant set (in many applications we may also require M to
be bounded) and let U M denoted a neighborhood of M.
The definition of Lyapunov stability of an invariant set is as follows.
Definition 16 (Lyapunov Stability of M). M is said to be Lyapunov stable
if for any neighborhood U M, x 2 U ) ft ( x ) 2 U, 8t > 0.
SImilarly, we have the following definition of asymptotic stability of
an invariant set.
Definition 17 (Asymptotic Stability of M). M is said to be asymptotically
stable if

33

The notion that stability of a trajectory
is a property of solutions in a neighborhood of a trajectory often causes confusion. To avoid confusion it is important
to be clear about the notion of a ‘’neighborhood of a trajectory”, and then to realize that for solutions that are Lyapunov
(or asymptotically) stable all solutions in
the neighborhood have the same behavior as t ! •.

34

ordinary differential equations

1. it is Lyapunov stable,
2. there exists a neighborhood U
0 as t ! •.

M such that 8 x 2 U, dist(ft ( x ), M ) !

In the dynamical systems approach to ordinary differential equations some alternative terminology is typically used.
Definition 18 (Attracting Set). If M is asymptotically stable it is said to be
an attracting set.
The significance of attracting sets is that they are the ‘’observable” regions in phase space since they are regions to which trajectories evolve
in time. The set of points that evolve towards a specific attracting set
is referred to as the basin of attraction for that invariant set.
Definition 19 (Basin of Attraction). Let B ⇢ R n denote the set of all
points, x 2 B ⇢ R n such that
dist(ft ( x ), M ) ! 0 as t ! •
Then |calB is called the basin of attraction of M.
We now consider an example that allows us to explicitly explore
these ideas2 .
Example 9. Consider the following autonomous vector field on the plane:
ẋ
ẏ

=

x,
2

= y (1

y2 ) ⌘ f ( y ),

( x, y) 2 R2 .

(3.10)

First, it is useful to note that the x and y components of (3.10) are independent. Consequently, this may seem like a trivial example. However, we will
see that such examples provide a great deal of insight, especially since they
allow for simple computations of many of the mathematical ideas.
In Fig. 3.1 we illustrate the flow of the x and y components of (3.10)
separately.
The two dimensional vector field (3.10) has equilibrium points at:

( x, y) = (0, 0),

(0, 1),

(0, 1).

In this example it is easy to identify three invariant horizontal lines (examples of invariant sets). Since y = 0 implies that ẏ = 0, this implies that the
x axis is invariant. Since y = 1 implies that ẏ = 0, this implies that the line
y = 1 is invariant. Since y = 1 implies that ẏ = 0, which implies that the
line y = 1 is invariant. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.2.3 Below we provide
some additional invariant sets for (3.10). It is instructive to understand why
they are invariant, and whether or not there are other invariant sets.

2

Initially, this type of problem (two independent, one dimensional autonomous
vector fields) might seem trivial and like
a completely academic problem. However, we believe that there is quite a
lot of insight that can be gained from
such problems (that has been the case
for the author). Generally, it is useful to think about breaking a problem
up into smaller, understandable, pieces
and then putting the pieces back together. Problems like this provide a
controlled way of doing this. But also,
these problems allow for exact computation by hand of concepts that do not
lend themselves to such computations
in the types of ODEs arising in typical applications. This gives some level
of confidence that you understand the
concept. Also, such examples could
served as useful benchmarks for numerical computations, since checking numerical methods against equations where
you have an analytical solution to the
equation can be very helpful.

Make sure you understand why these
constraints on the coordinates imply the
existence of invariant lines.

There is a point to consider early on in
this course. What exactly does ‘’sketch
the phase portrait mean”? It means
sketching trajectories through different
initial conditions in the phase space in
such a way that a ‘’complete picture” of
all qualitatively distinct trajectories is obtained. The phrase qualitatively distinct is
the key here since you can only sketch
trajectories for a finite number of initial
conditions (unless you sketch an invariant set or manifold) and only a finite
length of the trajectory, unless the trajectory is a fixed point, periodic, homoclinic, or heteroclinic.

Behavior Near Trajectories: Linearization

Now we are going to discuss a method for analyzing stability that utilizes linearization about the object whose
stability is of interest. For now, the ‘’objects of interest” are specific solutions of a vector field.The structure of the solutions of linear,
constant coefficient systems is covered in many ODE textbooks. My
favorite is the book of Hirsch et al.1 . It covers all of the linear algebra
needed for analyzing linear ODEs that you probably did not cover in
your linear algebra course. The book by Arnold2 is also very good, but
the presentation is more compact, with fewer examples.
We begin by considering a general nonautonomous vector field:
ẋ = f ( x, t),

x 2 Rn ,

(4.1)

and we suppose that
x̄ (t, t0 , x0 ),

(4.2)

is the solution of (4.1) for which we wish to determine its stability
properties. As when we introduced the definitions of stability, we
proceed by localizing the vector field about the solution of interest.
We do this by introducing the change of coordinates
x = y + x̄
for (4.1) as follows:
ẋ = ẏ + x̄˙ = f (y + x̄, t),
or

ẏ

=

f (y + x̄, t)

x̄˙ ,

=

f (y + x̄, t)

f ( x̄, t),

ordinary differential equations

where we omit the arguments of x̄ (t, t0 , x0 ) for the sake of a less cumbersome notation. Next we Taylor expand f (y + x̄, t) in y about the
solution x̄, but we will only require the leading order terms explicitly3 :
f (y + x̄, t) = f ( x̄, t) + D f ( x̄, t)y + O(|y|2 ),

(4.4)

where D f denotes the derivative (i.e. Jacobian matrix) of the vector
valued function f and O(|y|2 ) denotes higher order terms in the Taylor
expansion that we will not need in explicit form. Substituting this into
(4.4) gives:
ẏ

f ( x̄, t),

=

f (y + x̄, t)

=

f ( x̄, t) + D f ( x̄, t)y + O(|y|2 )

=

2

D f ( x̄, t)y + O(|y| ).

f ( x̄, t),
(4.5)

Keep in mind that we are interested in the behaviour of solutions near
x̄ (t, t0 , x0 ), i.e., for y small. Therefore, in that situation it seems reasonable that neglecting the O(|y|2 ) in (4.5) would be an approximation
that would provide us with the particular information that we seek.
For example, would it provide sufficient information for us to determine stability? In particular,
ẏ = D f ( x̄, t)y,

(4.6)

is referred to as the linearization of the vector field ẋ = f ( x, t) about
the solution x̄ (t, t0 , x0 ).
Before we answer the question as to whether or not (4.1) provides
an adequate approximation to solutions of (4.5) for y ‘’small”, we will
first study linear vector fields on their own.
Linear vector fields can also be classified as nonautonomous or autonomous. Nonautonomous linear vector fields are obtained by linearizing a nonautonomous vector field about a solution (and retaining
only the linear terms). They have the general form:
y (0) = y0 ,

(4.7)

A(t) ⌘ D f ( x̄ (t, t0 , x0 ), t)

(4.8)

ẏ = A(t)y,
where

is a n ⇥ n matrix. They can also be obtained by linearizing an autonomous vector field about a time-dependent solution.
An autonomous linear vector field is obtained by linearizing an autonomous vector field about an equilibrium point. More precisely, let
ẋ = f ( x ) denote an autonomous vector field and let x = x0 denote an

3

For the necessary background that you
will need on Taylor expansions see Appendix A.

behavior near trajectories: linearization

equilibrium point, i.e. f ( x0 ) = 0. The linearized autonomous vector
field about this equilibrium point has the form:
ẏ = D f ( x0 )y,

y (0) = y0 ,

(4.9)

or
ẏ = Ay,

y (0) = y0 ,

(4.10)

where A ⌘ D f ( x0 ) is a n ⇥ n matrix of real numbers. This is significant
because (4.10) can be solved using techniques of linear algebra, but
(4.7), generally, cannot be solved in this manner. Hence, we will now
describe the general solution of (4.10).
The general solution of (4.10) is given by:
y(t) = e At y0 .

(4.11)

In order to verify that this is the solution, we merely need to substitute
into the right hand side and the left hand side of (4.10) and show that
equality holds. However, first we need to explain what e At is, i.e. the
exponential of the n ⇥ n matrix A (by examining (4.11) it should be
clear that if (4.11) is to make sense mathematically, then e At must be a
n ⇥ n matrix).
Just like the exponential of a scalar, the exponential of a matrix is
defined through the exponential series as follows:
e At

⌘ I + At +
•

=

1 2 2
1
A t + · · · + An tn + · · · ,
2!
n!

1

Â i! Ai ti ,

(4.12)

i =0

where I denotes the n ⇥ n identity matrix. But we still must answer
the question, “does this exponential series involving products of matrices make mathematical sense”? Certainly we can compute products
of matrices and multiply them by scalars. But we have to give meaning to an infinite sum of such mathematical objects. We do this by
defining the norm of a matrix and then considering the convergence
of the series in norm. When this is done the ‘’convergence problem”
is exactly the same as that of the exponential of a scalar. Therefore
the exponential series for a matrix converges absolutely for all t, and
therefore it can be differentiated with respect to t term-by-term, and
the resulted series of derivatives also converges absolutely.
Next we need to argue that (4.11) is a solution of (4.10). If we differentiate the series (4.12) term by term, we obtain that:
d At
e = Ae At = e At A,
dt

(4.13)

39

40

ordinary differential equations

where we have used the fact that the matrices A and e At commute (this
is easy to deduce from the fact that A commutes with any power of
A)4 . It then follows from this calculation that:
d At
e y0 = Ae At y0 = Ay.
dt

ẏ =

(4.14)

Therefore the general problem of solving (4.10) is equivalent to computing e At , and we now turn our attention to this task.
First, suppose that A is a diagonal matrix, say

Then it is easy to see by substituting A into the exponential series (4.12)
that:

(4.16)

Therefore our strategy will be to transform coordinates so that in the
new coordinates A becomes diagonal (or as ‘’close as possible” to diagonal, which we will explain shortly). Then e At will be easily computable in these coordinates. Once that is accomplished, then we use
the inverse of the transformation to transform the solution back to the
original coordinate system.
Now we make these ideas precise. We let
y = Tu,

u 2 Rn , y 2 Rn ,

(4.17)

where T is a n ⇥ n matrix whose precise properties will be developed
in the following.
This is a typical approach in ODEs. We propose a general
coordinate transformation of the ODE, and then we construct it in a way that gives the properties of the ODE that
we desire. Substituting (4.17) into (4.10) gives:
(4.18)

ẏ = T u̇ = Ay = ATu,

T will be constructed in a way that makes it invertible, so that we have:
u̇ = T

ATu,

u (0) = T

(4.25)

Now we arrive at our main result. If T is constructed so that
L=T

1

AT,

(4.26)

is diagonal, then it follows from (4.16) and (4.25) that e At can always be
computed. So the ODE problem of solving (4.10) becomes a problem
in linear algebra. But can a general n ⇥ n matrix A always be diagonalized? If you have had a course in linear algebra, you know that
the answer to this question is “no”. There is a theory of the (real) that
will apply here. However, that would take us into too great a diversion for this course. Instead, we will consider the three standard cases

41

42

for 2 ⇥ 2 matrices. That will suffice for introducing the the main ideas
without getting bogged down in linear algebra. Nevertheless, it cannot
be avoided entirely. You will need to be able to compute eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of 2 ⇥ 2 matrices, and understand their meaning.
The three cases of 2 ⇥ 2 matrices that we will consider are characterized by their eigenvalues:
• two real eigenvalues, diagonalizable A,
• two identical eigenvalues, nondiagonalizable A,
• a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues.
In the table below we summarize the form that these matrices can be
transformed in to (referred to as the of A) and the resulting exponential
of this canonical form.

The next two problems often give students difficulties. There are no hard calculations involved. Just a bit of thinking.
The solutions for each ODE can be obtained easily. Once these are obtained
you just need to think about what they
mean in terms of the concepts involved
in the questions that you are asked, e.g.
Lyapunov stability means that if you
‘’start close, you stay close–forever”.

Behavior Near Equilbria: Linearization
Now we will consider several examples for solving, and understanding, the nature of the solutions, of
x 2 R2 .

ẋ = Ax,

(5.1)

For all of the examples, the method for solving the system is the
same.

Once we have computed e At we have the solution of (5.1) through

The eigenvectors are complex, so we know it is not diagonalizable over the real
numbers. What this means is that we cannot find real eigenvectors so that it
can be transformed to a form where there are real numbers on the diagonal,
and zeros in the off diagonal entries. The best we can do is to transform it
to a form where the real parts of the eigenvalue are on the diagonal, and the
imaginary parts are on the off diagonal locations, but the off diagonal elements
differ by a minus sign.

The phase portrait of (5.42) is shown in 5.3.
It is easy to see that the origin is unstable for (5.42). In fig. 5.3 we see that
the origin has the structure of a saddle point, and we want to explore this idea
further.
In the u1 u2 coordinates the span of the eigenvector corresponding to the
p
eigenvalue 2 is given by u2 = 0, i.e. the u1 axis. The span of the eigenvector
p
corresponding to the eigenvalue
2 is given by u1 = 0, i.e. the u2 axis.
Moreover, we can see from the form of (5.42) that these coordinate axes are
invariant. The u1 axis is referred to as the unstable subspace, denoted by Eu ,
and the u2 axis is referred to as the stable subspace, denoted by Es . In other
words, the unstable subspace is the span of the eigenvector corresponding to
the eigenvalue with positive real part and the stable subspace is the span of

the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue having negative real part. The
stable and unstable subspaces are invariant subspaces with respect to the flow
generated by (5.42).
The stable and unstable subspaces correspond to the coordinate axes in the
coordinate system given by the eigenvectors. Next we want to understand
how they would appear in the original x1 x2 coordinates. This is accomplished by transforming them to the original coordinates using the transformation matrix (5.39).
We first transform the unstable subspace from the u1 u2 coordinates to
the x1 x2 coordinates. In the u1 u2 coordinates points on the unstable
subspace have coordinates (u1 , 0). Acting on these points with T gives:

This is the equation for the stable subspace in the x1 x2 coordinates, which
we illustrate in Fig. 5.5.
In Fig. 5.6 we illustrate both the stable and the unstable subspaces in the
original coordinates.
Now we want to discuss some general results from these three examples.
For all three examples, the real parts of the eigenvalues of A were
nonzero, and stability of the origin was determined by the sign of the
real parts of the eigenvalues, e.g., for example 10 the origin was unstable (the real parts of the eigenvalues of A were positive), for example
11 the origin was stable (the real parts of the eigenvalues of A were

negative), and for example 12 the origin was unstable (A had one positive eigenvalue and one negative eigenvalue). This is generally true
for all linear, autonomous vector fields. We state this more formally.
Consider a linear, autonomous vector field on R n :
ẏ = Ay,

y (0) = y0 ,

y 2 Rn .

(5.51)

Then if A has no eigenvalues having zero real parts, the stability of the
origin is determined by the real parts of the eigenvalues of A. If all
of the real parts of the eigenvalues are strictly less than zero, then the
origin is asymptotically stable. If at least one of the eigenvalues of A
has real part strictly larger than zero, then the origin is unstable.
There is a term applied to this terminology that permeates all of
dynamical systems theory.

56

ordinary differential equations

Definition 20 (Hyperbolic Equilibrium Point). The origin of (5.51) is
said to be if none of the real parts of the eigenvalues of A have zero real parts.

It follows that hyperbolic equilibria of linear, autonomous vector
fields on R n can be either sinks, sources, or saddles. The key point is
that the eigenvalues of A all have nonzero real parts.
If we restrict ourselves to two dimensions, it is possible to make a
(short) list of all of the distinct canonical forms for A. These are given
by the following six 2 ⇥ 2 matrices.
The first is a diagonal matrix with real, nonzero eigenvalues l, µ 6=
0, i.e. the origin is a hyperbolic fixed point:
l
0

0
µ

!

(5.52)

In this case the orgin can be a sink if both eigenvalues are negative, a
source if both eigenvalues are positive, and a saddle if the eigenvalues
have opposite sign.
The next situation corresponds to complex eigenvalues, with the
real part, a, and imaginary part, b, both being nonzero. In this case
the equilibrium point is hyperbolic, and a sink for a < 0, and a source
for a > 0. The sign of b does not influence stability:
a
b

b
a

!

.

(5.53)

Next we consider the case when the eigenvalues are real, identical,
and nonzero, but the matrix is nondiagonalizable, i.e. two eigenvectors
cannot be found. In this case the origin is hyperbolic for l 6= 0, and is
a sink for l < 0 and a source for l > 0:
l
0

1
l

!

(5.54)

Next we consider some cases corresponding to the origin being nonhyperbolic that would have been possible to include in the discussion
of earlier cases, but it is more instructive to explicitly point out these
cases separately.
We first consider the case where A is diagonalizable with one nonzero
real eigenvalue and one zero eigenvalue:
l
0

0
0

!

.

(5.55)

We consider the case where the two eigenvalues are purely imagi-

b. In this case the origin is referred to as a center.

!

(5.56)

For completeness, we consider the case where both eigenvalues are
zero and A is diagonal.
0
0

.

(5.57)

Finally, we want to expand on the discussion related to the geometrical aspects of Example 12. Recall that for that example the span
of the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue with negative real
part was an invariant subspace, referred to as the stable subspace. Trajectories with initial conditions in the stable subspace decayed to zero
at an exponential rate as t ! +•. The stable invariant subspace was
denoted by Es . Similarly, the span of the eigenvector corresponding
to the eigenvalue with positive real part was an invariant subspace,
referred to as the unstable subspace. Trajectories with initial conditions in the unstable subspace decayed to zero at an exponential rate
as t ! •. The unstable invariant subspace was denoted by Eu .
We can easily see that (5.52) has this behavior when l and µ have
opposite signs. If l and µ are both negative, then the span of the
eigenvectors corresponding to these two eigenvalues is R2 , and the
entire phase space is the stable subspace. Similarly, if l and µ are both
positive, then the span of the eigenvectors corresponding to these two
eigenvalues is R2 , and the entire phase space is the unstable subspace.
The case (5.53) is similar. For that case there is not a pair of real
eigenvectors corresponding to each of the complex eigenvalues. The
vectors that transform the original matrix to this canonical form are referred to as generalized eigenvectors. If a < 0 the span of the generalized
eigenvectors is R2 , and the entire phase space is the stable subspace.
Similarly, if a > 0 the span of the generalized eigenvectors is R2 , and
the entire phase space is the unstable subspace. The situation is similar
for (5.54). For l < 0 the entire phase space is the stable subspace, for
l > 0 the entire phase space is the unstable subspace.
The case (5.55) is different. The span of the eigenvector corresponding to l is the stable subspace for l < 0, and the unstable subspace for
l > 0 The space of the eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigenvalue is referred to as the center subspace.
For the case (5.56) there are not two real eigenvectors leading to the
resulting canonical form. Rather, there are two generalized eigenvectors associated with this pair of complex eigenvalues having zero real
part. The span of these two eigenvectors is a two dimensional center subspace corresponding to R2 . An equilibrium point with purely

57

58

ordinary differential equations

imaginary eigenvalues is referred to as a center.
Finally, the case (5.57) is included for completeness. It is the zero
vector field where R2 is the center subspace.
We can characterize stability of the origin in terms of the stable,
unstable, and center subspaces. The origin is asymptotically stable if
Eu = ∆ and Ec = ∆. The origin is unstable if Eu 6= ∆.

Stable and Unstable Manifolds of Equilibria

For hyperbolic equilibria of autonomous vector fields, the
linearization captures the local behavior near the equilibria for the nonlinear vector field. We describe the results
justifying this statement in the context of two dimensional autonomous
systems.1
We consider a Cr , r

of the following form:

ẋ

f ( x, y),

ẏ

=

g( x, y),

( x, y)R2 .

(6.1)

Let ft (·) denote the flow generated by (6.1). Suppose ( x0 , y0 ) is a hyperbolic equilibrium point of this vector field, i.e. the two eigenvalues
of the Jacobian matrix:
∂f
∂x ( x0 , y0 )
∂g
∂x ( x0 , y0 )

have nonzero real parts. There are three cases to consider:
• ( x0 , y0 ) is a source for the linearized vector field,
• ( x0 , y0 ) is a sink for the linearized vector field,
• ( x0 , y0 ) is a saddle for the linearized vector field.
We consider each case individually. 2

(x0 , y0 ) is a source.
In this case ( x0 , y0 ) is a source for (6.1). More precisely, there exists
a neighborhood U of ( x0 , y0 ) such that for any p 2 U , ft ( p) leaves U
as t increases.

hyperbolic source and sink can be found

(x0 , y0 ) is a sink.
In this case ( x0 , y0 ) is a sink for (6.1). More precisely, there exists a
neighborhood S of ( x0 , y0 ) such that for any p 2 S , ft ( p) approaches
( x0 , y0 ) at an exponential rate as t increases. In this case ( x0 , y0 ) is an
example of an attracting set and its basin of attraction is given by:

B⌘

[

ft (S) .

t 0

(x0 , y0 ) is a saddle.
For the case of hyperbolic saddle points, the saddle point structure is still retained near the equilibrium point for nonlinear systems.
We now explain precisely what this means. In order to do this we
will need to examine (6.1) more closely. In particular, we will need
to transform (6.1) to a coordinate system that ‘’localizes” the behavior
near the equilibrium point and specifically displays the structure of
the linear part. We have already done this several times in examining
the behavior near specific solutions, so we will not repeat those details.
Transforming locally near ( x0 , y0 ) in this manner, we can express
(6.1) in the following form:

ẋ

=

a
0

x

(6.2)

where the Jacobian at the origin,

reflects the hyperbolic nature of the equilibrium point. The linearization of (6.1) about the origin is given by:

(6.4)

It is easy to see for the linearized system that
Es = {(x, h ) | h = 0} ,

(6.5)

is the invariant stable subspace and
Eu = {(x, h ) | x = 0} ,
is the invariant unstable subspace.

(6.6)

stable and unstable manifolds of equilibria

We now state how this saddle point structure is inherited by the
nonlinear system by stating the results of the stable and unstable manifold theorem for hyperbolic equilibria for two dimensional nonautonomous
vector fields3 .
First, we consider two intervals of the coordinate axes containing
the origin as follows:

and

Ix ⌘ { e < x < e} ,

(6.7)

Ih ⌘ { e < h < e} ,

(6.8)

for some small e > 0. A neighborhood of the origin is constructed by
taking the cartesian product of these two intervals:
n
o
Be ⌘ (x, h ) 2 R2 | (x, h ) 2 Ix ⇥ Ih ,

(6.9)

and it is illustrated in Fig. 6.1. The stable and unstable manifold
theorem for hyperbolic equilibrium points of autonomous vector fields
states the following.
There exists a Cr curve, given by the graph of a function of the x
variables:
h = S ( x ),

x 2 Ix ,

(6.10)

This curve has three important properties.

It passes through the origin, i.e. S(0) = 0.
It is tangent to Es at the origin, i.e.,

dS
dx (0)

= 0.

It is locally invariant in the sense that any trajectory starting on the
curve approaches the origin at an exponential rate as t ! •, and it
leaves Be as t ! •.
Moreover, the curve satisfying these three properties is unique. For
these reasons, this curve is referred to as the local stable manifold of
the origin, and it is denoted by:
s
Wloc
((0, 0)) = {(x, h ) 2 Be | h = S(x )} .

(6.11)

Similarly, there exists another Cr curve, given by the graph of a
function of the h variables:
x = U ( h ),

h 2 Ih ,

This curve has three important properties.

It passes through the origin, i.e. U (0) = 0.

The stable and unstable manifold theorem for hyperbolic equilibria of autonomous vector fields is a fundamental result. The proof requires some preliminary work to develop the appropriate mathematical setting in order for the
proof to proceed. See, for example, .
Of course, before one proves a result one
must have a through understanding of
the result that one hopes to prove. For
this reason we focus on explicit examples here.

It is locally invariant in the sense that any trajectory starting on the

For these reasons, this curve is referred to as the local unstable manifold of the origin, and it is denoted by:

This vector field has an equilibrium point at the origin, ( x, y) = (0, 0). The
Jacobian of the vector field evaluated at the origin is given by:

.

(6.17)

From this calculation we can conclude that the origin is a hyperbolic saddle
point. Moreover, the x-axis is the unstable subspace for the linearized vector
field and the y axis is the stable subspace for the linearized vector field.
Next we consider the nonlinear vector field (6.16). By inspection, we see
that the y axis (i.e. x = 0) is the global stable manifold for the origin. We
next consider the unstable manifold. Dividing the second equation by the first
equation in (6.16) gives:
ẏ

It is also tangent to the unstable subspace at the origin. It is the global
unstable manifold5 .
We examine this statement further. It is easy to compute the flow generated by (6.16). The x-component can be solved and substituted into the y
component to yield a first order linear nonautonomous equation. Hence, the
flow generated by (6.16) is given by6 :

This linear first order equation can be
solved in the usual way with an integrating factor. See Appendix B for details of
this procedure.

You should verify that this curve is invariant. In terms of the vector field, invariance means that the vector field is
tangent to the curve. Why?
6

Again, the equation is solved in the
usual way by using an integrating factor,
see Appendix B for details.

(6.20)

The global unstable manifold of the origin is the set of initial conditions having
the property that the trajectories through these initial conditions approach the
origin at an exponential rate as t ! •. On examining the two components
of (6.20), we see that the x component approaches zero as t ! • for any
choice of x0 . However, the y component will only approach zero as t ! •
if y0 and x0 are chosen such that

(6.19) characterizes the unstable manifold as an invariant curve passing
through the origin and tangent to the unstable subspace at the origin. (6.21) characterizes the unstable manifold in terms
of the asymptotic behavior of trajectories
(as t ! •) whose initial conditions
satisfy a particular constraint, and that
constraint is that they are on the unstable manifold of the origin.

The x-axis is clearly the global stable manifold for this equilibrium point. The
segment on the y-axis between 1 and 1 is invariant, but it does not correspond to a hyperbolic direction. It is referred to as the center manifold of
the origin, and we will learn much more about invariant manifolds associated
with nonhyperbolic directions later.

Lyapunov’s Method and the LaSalle Invariance Principle
We will next learn a method for determining stability of equilibria
which may be applied when stability information obtained from the
linearization of the ODE is not sufficient for determining stability information for the nonlinear ODE. The book by LaSalle1 is an excellent
supplement to this lecture. This is Lyapunov’s method (or Lyapunov’s
second method, or the method of Lyapunov functions). 2 We begin by
describing the framework for the method in the setting that we will
use.
We consider a general Cr , r 1) autonomous ODE
x 2 Rn ,

ẋ = f ( x ),

(7.1)

having an equilibrium point at x = x̄, i.e.,
f ( x̄ ) = 0.

We can now state Lyapunov’s theorem on stability of the equilibrium point x = x̄.
Theorem 1. Consider the following Cr (r

ẋ = f ( x ),

x 2 Rn .

(7.5)

74

ordinary differential equations

Let x = x̄ be a fixed point of (7.5) and let V : U ! R be a C1 function
defined in some neighborhood U of x̄ such that:
1. V ( x̄ ) = 0 and V ( x ) > 0 if x 6= x̄.
2. V̇ ( x )  0 in U

{ x̄ }

Then x̄ is Lyapunov stable. Moreover, if
V̇ ( x ) < 0

in U

{ x̄ }

then x̄ is asymptotically stable.

The function V ( x ) is referred to as a Lyapunov function.
We now consider an example.
Example 17.
ẋ

= y,

ẏ

=

x

ex2 y,

( x, y) 2 R2 ,

(7.6)

where e is a parameter. It is clear that ( x, y) = (0, 0) is an equilibrium point
of (7.6) and we want to determine the nature of its stability.
We begin by linearizing (7.6) about this equilibrium point. The matrix
associated with this linearization is given by:
0
1

A=

1
0

!

,

(7.7)

and its eigenvalues are ±i. Hence, the origin is not hyperbolic and therefore
the information provided by the linearization of (7.6) about ( x, y) = (0, 0)
does not provide information about stability of ( x, y) = (0, 0) for the nonlinear system (7.6).
Therefore we will attempt to apply Lyapunov’s method to determine stability of the origin.
We take as a Lyapunov function:
1 2
( x + y2 ).
(7.8)
2
Note that V (0, 0) = 0 and V ( x, y) > 0 in any neighborhood of the origin.
Moreover, we have:
V ( x, y) =

Hence, it follows from Theorem 1 that the origin is Lyapunov stable3 .

(7.9)
3

The obvious question that comes up at
this point is, how do I find the Lyapunov
function? We discuss this issue in Appendix C.

lyapunov’s method and the lasalle invariance principle

Next we will introduce the LaSalle invariance principle4 . Rather
than focus on the particular question of stability of an equilibrium solution as in Lyapunov’s method, the LaSalle invariance principle gives
conditions that describe the behavior as t ! • of all solutions of an
autonomous ODE.
We begin with an autonomous ODE defined on R n :
x 2 Rn

ẋ = f ( x ),

(7.10)

where f ( x ) is Cr , (r 1). Let ft (·) denote the flow generated by (7.10)
and let M ⇢ R n denote a positive invariant set that is compact (i.e.
closed and bounded in this setting). Suppose we have a scalar valued
function
V : R n ! R,

(7.11)

such that
V̇ ( x )  0

in

(7.12)

M

(Note the ‘’less than or equal to” in this inequality.)
Let
E = x 2 M | V̇ ( x ) = 0 ,

(7.13)

and
M=

(

the union of all trajectories that start
in E and remain in E for all t 0

)

(7.14)

Now we can state LaSalle’s invariance principle.
Theorem 2. For all x 2 M, ft ( x ) ! M as t ! •.
We will now consider an example.
Example 18. Consider the following vector field on R2 :

ẋ

= y,

ẏ

=

x

x3

dy,

( x, y) 2 R2 ,

d > 0.

(7.15)

This vector field has three equilibrium points–a saddle point at ( x, y) = (0, 0)
and two sinks at ( x, y) = (±, 1, 0).
Consider the function
V ( x, y) =
and its level sets:

(7.17)

from which it follows that
V̇ ( x, y)  0

on

V ( x, y) = C.

Therefore, for C sufficiently large, the corresponding level set of V bounds a
compact positive invariant set, M, containing the three equilibrium points of
(7.15).
Next we determine the nature of the set
E = {( x, y) 2 M | V̇ ( x, y) = 0}.

(7.18)

Using (7.17) we see that:
E = {( x, y) 2 M | y = 0 \ M}.

(7.19)

The only points in E that remain in E for all time are:
M = {(±1, 0),

(0, 0)}.

(7.20)

Therefore it follows from Theorem 2 that given any initial condition in M,
the trajectory starting at that initial condition approaches one of the three
equilibrium points as t ! •.

Autonomous Vector Fields on the Plane; Bendixson’s Criterion and the
Index Theorem
Now we will consider some useful results that apply to vector fields
on the plane.
First we will consider a simple, and easy to apply, criterion that
rules out the existence of periodic orbits for autonomous vector fields
on the plane (e.g., it is not valid for vector fields on the two torus).
We consider a Cr , r
1 vector field on the plane of the following
form:

ẋ

=

f ( x, y),

ẏ

=

g( x, y),

( x, y) 2 R2

(7.21)

lyapunov’s method and the lasalle invariance principle

The following criterion due to Bendixson provides a simple, computable condition that rules out the existence of periodic orbits in certain regions of R2 .
Theorem 3 (Bendixson’s Criterion). If on a simply connected region D ⇢
R2 the expression
∂f
∂g
( x, y) + ( x, y).
∂x
∂y

(7.22)

is not identically zero and does not change sign then (7.21) has no periodic
orbits lying entirely in D.
Example 19. We consider the following nonlinear autonomous vector field
on the plane:

ẋ
ẏ

= y ⌘ f ( x, y),
=

x

x3

dy ⌘ g( x, y),

( x, y) 2 R2 ,

d > 0.

(7.23)

Computing (7.22) gives:
∂f
∂g
+
=
∂x
∂y

(7.24)

d.

Therefore this vector field has no periodic orbits for d 6= 0.
Example 20. We consider the following linear autonomous vector field on
the plane:

ẋ
ẏ

= ax + by ⌘ f ( x, y),
= cx + dy ⌘ g( x, y),

( x, y) 2 R2 ,

a, b, c, d 2 R (7.25)

Computing (7.22) gives:
∂f
∂g
+
= a + d.
∂x
∂y

(7.26)

Therefore for a + d 6= 0 this vector field has no periodic orbits.
Next we will consider the index theorem. If periodic orbits exist, it
provides conditions on the number of fixed points, and their stability,
that are contained in the region bounded by the periodic orbit.
Theorem 4. Inside any periodic orbit there must be at least one fixed point.
If there is only one, then it must be a sink, source, or center. If all the fixed
points inside the periodic orbit are hyperbolic, then there must be an odd
number, 2n + 1, of which n are saddles, and n + 1 are either sinks or sources.

Example 21. We consider the following nonlinear autonomous vector field
on the plane:

ẋ
ẏ

= y ⌘ f ( x, y),
=

x

x3

dy + x2 y ⌘ g( x, y),

( x, y) 2 R2 ,

(7.27)

where d > 0. The equilibrium points are given by:

( x, y) = (0, 0), (±1, 0).
The Jacobian of the vector field, denoted by A, is given by:
0

A=

1

1
d + x2

3x2 + 2xy

(7.28)

Using the general expression for the eigenvalues for a 2 ⇥ 2 matrix A:
q

(tr A)2 4 det A,

we obtain the following expression for the eigenvalues of the Jacobian:

l1,2 =

2

q

( d + x 2 )2 + 4(1

(7.29)

If we substitute the locations of the equilibria into this expression we obtain
the following values for the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the vector field
evaluated at the respective equilibria:

(0, 0) l1,2 =
(±1, 0) l1,2 =

From these expressions we conclude that (0, 0) is a saddle for all values of d
and (±1, 0) are
sinks for
centers for
sources for

d>1
d=1
0<d<1

(7.32)

Now we will use Bendixson’s criterion and the index theorem to determine
regions in the phase plane where periodic orbits may exist. For this example
(7.22) is given by:
d + x2 .
(7.33)

Hence the two vertical lines x =

regions (or else Bendixson’s criterion would be violated). There are two cases
to be considered for the location of these vertical lines with respect to the
equilibria: d > 1 and 0 < d < 1.
In Fig. 7.1 we show three possibilities (they do not exhaust all possible
cases) for the existence of periodic orbits that would satisfy Bendixson’s criterion in the case d > 1. However, (b) is not possible because it violates the

Bifurcation of Equilibria, I

We will now study the topic of bifurcation of equilibria of
autonomous vector fields, or ‘’what happens as an equilibrium
point loses hyperbolicity as a parameter is varied?” We will study
this question through a series of examples, and then consider what the
examples teach us about the ‘’general situation” (and what this might
be).
Example 22 (The Saddle-Node Bifurcation). Consider the following nonlinear, autonomous vector field on R2 :
ẋ

= µ

ẏ

=

x2 ,
y,

( x, y) 2 R2

(8.1)

where µ is a (real) parameter. The equilibrium points of (8.1) are given by:

p
p
( x, y) = ( µ, 0), (
µ, 0).

(8.2)

It is easy to see that there are no equilibrium points for µ < 0, one equilibrium
point for µ = 0, and two equilibrium points for µ > 0.
The Jacobian of the vector field evaluated at each equilibrium point is given
by:

p

( µ, 0) :

p
2 µ
0

0
1

!

,

(8.3)

from which it follows that the equilibria are hyperbolic and asymptotically
stable for µ > 0, and nonhyperbolic for µ = 0.

(

(8.4)

from which it follows that the equilibria are hyperbolic saddle points for µ > 0,
and nonhyperbolic for µ = 0. We emphasize again that there are no equilibrium points for µ < 0.

84

ordinary differential equations

As a result of the ‘’structure” of (8.1) we can easily represent the behavior
of the equilibria as a function of µ in a bifurcation diagram. That is, since the
x and y components of (8.1) are ‘’decoupled”, and the change in the number
and stability of equilibria us completely captured by the x coordinates, we can
plot the x component of the vector field as a function of µ, as we show in Fig.
8.1.
Figure 8.1: Bifurcation diagram for (8.1)
in the µ x plane. The curve of equilibria is given by µ = x2 . The dashed
line denotes the part of the curve corresponding to unstable equilibria, and the
solid line denotes the part of the curve
corresponding to stable equilibria.

This type of bifurcation is referred to as a saddle-node bifurcation (occa-

bifurcation of equilibria, i

85

sionally it may also be referred to as a fold bifurcation or tangent bifurcation,
but these terms are used less frequently).
The key characteristic of the saddle-node bifurcation is the following. As a
parameter (µ) is varied, the number of equilibria change from zero to two, and
the change occurs at a parameter value corresponding to the two equilibria
coalescing into one nonhyperbolic equilibrium.
µ is called the bifurcation parameter and µ = 0 is called the bifurcation
point.
Example 23 (The Transcritical Bifurcation). Consider the following nonlinear, autonomous vector field on R2 :

ẋ

( x, y) 2 R2 ,

(8.5)

where µ is a (real) parameter. The equilibrium points of (8.5) are given by:

(8.8)

from which it follows that (0, 0) is asymptotically stable for µ < 0, and a
hyperbolic saddle for µ > 0, and (µ, 0) is a hyperbolic saddle for µ < 0 and
asymptotically stable for µ > 0. These two lines of fixed points cross at µ = 0,
at which there is only one, nonhyperbolic fixed point.
In Fig. 8.3 we show the bifurcation diagram for (8.5) in the µ x plane.

This type of bifurcation is referred to as a transcritical bifurcation.
The key characteristic of the transcritical bifurcation is the following. As
a parameter (µ) is varied, the number of equilibria change from two to one,
and back to two, and the change in number of equilibria occurs at a parameter

from negative to positive the equilibrium point loses stability, but as
µ increases past zero the trajectories near the origin are bounded in
how far away from the origin they can move. In the subcritical pitchfork bifurcation the origin loses stability as µ increases from negative
to positive, but trajectories near the unstable equilibrium can become
unbounded.
It is natural to ask the question,
‘’what is common about these three examples of bifurcations of fixed points of one dimensional autonomous vector fields?” We note the following.
• A necessary (but not sufficient) for bifurcation of a fixed point is
nonhyperbolicity of the fixed point.
• The ‘’nature” of the bifurcation (e.g. numbers and stability of fixed
points that are created or destroyed) is determined by the form of
the nonlinearity.
But we could go further and ask what is in common about these
examples that could lead to a definition of the bifurcation of a fixed

90

ordinary differential equations

point for autonomous vector fields? From the common features we
give the following definition.
Definition 21 (Bifurcation of a fixed point of a one dimensional autonomous vector field). We consider a one dimensional autonomous vector
field depending on a parameter, µ. We assume that at a certain parameter
value it has a fixed point that is not hyperbolic. We say that a bifurcation
occurs at that ‘’nonhyperbolic parameter value” if for µ in a neighborhood of
that parameter value the number of fixed points and their stability changes1 .
Finally, we finish the discussion of bifurcations of a fixed point of
one dimensional autonomous vector fields with an example showing
that a nonhyperbolic fixed point may not bifurcate as a parameter is
varied, i.e. non-hyperbolicity is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for bifurcation.

1

Consider this definition in the context
of our examples (and pay particular attention to the transcritical bifurcation).

Example 26. We consider the one dimensional autonomous vector field:
ẋ = µ

x3 ,

(8.17)

x 2 R,

where µ is a parameter. This vector field has a nonhyperbolic fixed point at
x = 0 for µ = 0. The curve of fixed points in the µ x plane is given by
µ = x3 , and the Jacobian of the vector field is 3x2 , which is strictly negative
at all fixed points, except the nonhyperbolic fixed point at the origin.
In fig. 8.9 we plot the fixed points as a function of µ.
Figure 8.9:
(8.17).

We see that there is no change in the number or stability of the fixed points
for µ > 0 and µ < 0. Hence, no bifurcation.

Bifurcation of Equilibria, II
We have examined fixed points of one dimensional autonomous vector
fields where the matrix associated with the linearization of the vector
field about the fixed point has a zero eigenvalue.
It is natural to ask ‘’are there more complicated bifurcations, and what makes them complicated?”. If one thinks
about the examples considered so far, there are two possibilities that
could complicate the situation. One is that there could be more than
one eigenvalue of the linearization about the fixed point with zero
real part (which would necessarily require a consideration of higher
dimensional vector fields), and the other would be more complicated
nonlinearity (or a combination of these two). Understanding how dimensionality and nonlinearity contribute to the ‘’complexity” of a bifurcation (and what that might mean) is a very interesting topic, but
beyond the scope of this course. This is generally a topic explored in
graduate level courses on dynamical systems theory that emphasize
bifurcation theory. Here we are mainly just introducing the basic ideas
and issues with examples that one might encounter in applications.
Towards that end we will consider an example of a bifurcation that
is very important in applications–the Poincaré-Andronov-Hopf bifurcation (or just Hopf bifurcation as it is more commonly referred to).
This is a bifurcation of a fixed point of an autonomous vector field
where the fixed point is nonhyperbolic as a result of the Jacobian having a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues, ±i w, w 6= 0. Therefore
this type of bifurcation requires (at least two dimensions), and it is
not characterize by a change in the number of fixed points, but by the
creation of time dependent periodic solutions. We will analyze this
situation by considering a specific example. References solely devoted
to the Hopf bifurcation are the books of Marsden and McCracken1 and
Hassard, Kazarinoff, and Wan2 .
We consider the following nonlinear autonomous vector field on the
plane:

(9.4)

The origin is not hyperbolic at µ = 0, and there is a change in stability
as µ changes sign. We want to analyze the behaviour near the origin,
both in phase space and in parameter space, in more detail.
Towards this end we transform (9.1) to polar coordinates using the
standard relationship between cartesian and polar coordinates:
x = r cos q,

y = r sin q

(9.5)

Differentiating these two expressions with respect to t, and substituting into (9.1) gives:
ẋ = ṙ cos q

where (9.8) is obtained by multiplying (9.6) by cos q and (9.7) by sin q
and adding the two results, and (9.9) is obtained by multiplying (9.6)

bifurcation of equilibria, ii

by sin q and (9.7) by cos q and adding the two results. Dividing both
equations by r gives the two equations that we will analyze:

= µr + ar3 ,

(9.11)

Note that (9.10) has the form of the pitchfork bifurcation that we studied earlier. However, it is very important to realize that we are dealing
with the equations in polar coordinates and to understand what they
reveal to us about the dynamics in the original cartesian coordinates.
To begin with, we must keep in mind that r 0.
Note that (9.10) is independent of q, i.e. it is a one dimensional,
autonomous ODE which we rewrite below:
ṙ = µr + ar3 = r (µ + ar2 ).

(9.12)

The fixed points of this equation are:
r = 0,
(Keep in mind that r

(9.15)

Therefore r does not change in time at r = r + and q evolves linearly
in time. But q is an angular coordinate. This implies that r = r +
corresponds to a periodic orbit3 .
Using this information, we analyze the behavior of (9.12) by constructing the bifurcation diagram. There are two cases to consider:
a > 0 and a < 0.
In figure 9.1 we sketch the zeros of (9.12) as a function of µ for a > 0.
We see that a periodic orbit bifurcates from the nonhyperbolic fixed
point at µ = 0. The periodic orbit is unstable and exists for µ < 0. In
Fig. 9.2 we illustrate the dynamics in the x y phase plane.
In figure 9.3 we sketch the zeros of (9.12) as a function of µ for a < 0.
We see that a periodic orbit bifurcates from the nonhyperbolic fixed
point at µ = 0. The periodic orbit is stable in this case and exists for
µ > 0. In Fig. 9.4 we illustrate the dynamics in the x y phase plane.

3

At this point it is very useful to ‘’pause”
and think about the reasoning that led to
the conclusion that r = r + is a periodic
orbit.

In this example we have seen that a nonhyperbolic fixed point of a

orbits as a parameter is varied. This is an example of what is generally
called the Hopf bifurcation. It is the first example we have seen of
the bifurcation of an equilibrium solution resulting in time-dependent
solutions.
At this point it is useful to summarize the nature of the conditions
resulting in a Hopf bifurcation for a two dimensional, autonomous
vector field. To begin with, we need a fixed point where the Jacobian associated with the linearization about the fixed point has a pair
of pure imaginary eigenvalues. This is a necessary condition for the
Hopf bifurcation. Now just as for bifurcations of fixed points of one
dimensional autonomous vector fields (e.g., the saddle-node, transcritical, and pitchfork bifurcations that we have studied in the previous chapter) the nature of the bifurcation for parameter values in
a neighbourhood of the bifurcation parameter is determined by the
form of the nonlinearity of the vector field4 . We developed the idea
of the Hopf bifurcation in the context of (9.1), and in that example
the stability of the bifurcating periodic orbit was given by the sign
of the coefficient a (stable for a < 0, unstable for a > 0). In the example the âĂŸâĂŹstability coefficientâĂŹâĂŹ was evident from the
simple structure of the nonlinearity. In more complicated examples,

4

It would be very insightful to think
about this statement in the context of the
saddle-node, transcritical, and pitchfork
bifurcations that we studied in the previous chapter.

98

ordinary differential equations

i.e. more complicated nonlinear terms, the determination of the stability coefficient is more âĂŸâĂŹalgebraically intensiveâĂŹâĂŹ. Explicit
expressions for the stability coefficient are given in many dynamical
systems texts. For example, it is given in Guckenheimer and Holmes5
and Wiggins6 . The complete details of the calculation of the stability
coefficient are carried out in 7 . Problem 2 at the end of this chapter explores the nature of the Hopf bifurcation, e.g. the number and stability
of bifurcating periodic orbits, for different forms of nonlinearity.
Next, we return to the examples of bifurcations of fixed points in
one dimensional vector fields and give two examples of one dimensional vector fields where more than one of the bifurcations we discussed earlier can occur.

Center Manifold Theory

This chapter is about center manifolds, dimensional reduction, and stability of fixed points of autonomous vector fields.1 We begin with a motivational example.
Example 29. Consider the following linear, autonomous vector field on R c ⇥
Rs :
ẋ

=

Ax,

ẏ

=

By,

( x, y) 2 R c ⇥ R s ,

(10.1)

where A is a c ⇥ c matrix of real numbers having eigenvalues with zero real
part and B is a s ⇥ s matrix of real numbers having eigenvalues with negative
real part. Suppose we are interested in stability of the nonhyperbolic fixed
point ( x, y) = (0, 0). Then that question is determined by the nature of
stability of x = 0 in the lower dimensional vector field:
x 2 Rc .

ẋ = Ax,

(10.2)

This follows from the nature of the eigenvalues of B, and the properties that x
and y are decoupled in (10) and that it is linear. More precisely, the solution
of (10) is given by:
x (t, x0 )
y(t, y0 )

!

=

e At x0
e Bt y0

!

.

(10.3)

From the assumption of the real parts of the eigenvalues of B having negative
real parts, it follows that:
lim e Bt y0 = 0.

t!•

In fact, 0 is approached at an exponential rate in time. Therefore it follows
that stability, or asymptotic stability, or instability of x = 0 for (10.2) implies
stability, or asymptotic stability, or instability of ( x, y) = (0, 0) for (10).

Expositions of center manifold theory
are mostly found in advanced dynamical systems textbooks. It is likely true
that all such expositions have their roots
in the monographs of Henry and Carr
. The monograph of Henry is a bit obscure, but it is a seminal work in the
field. The monograph of Carr is a real
jewel. All of the theorems in this chapter are taken from Carr, where the proofs
can also be found.

ordinary differential equations

It is natural to ask if such a dimensional reduction procedure holds for
nonlinear systems. This might seem unlikely since, in general, nonlinear
systems are coupled and the superposition principle of linear systems does not
hold. However, we will see that this is not the case.
Invariant manifolds lead to a form of decoupling that results in a dimensional reduction procedure that gives, essentially, the same result as is obtained for this motivational linear example2 .This
is the topic of center manifold theory that we now develop.
We begin by describing the set-up. It is important to realize that
when applying these results to a vector field, it must be in the following form.
ẋ

=

Ax + f ( x, y),

ẏ

=

By + g( x, y),

( x, y) 2 R c ⇥ R s ,

(10.4)

where the matrices A and B are have the following properties:
A
B

c ⇥ c matrix of real numbers
having eigenvalues with zero real parts,
s ⇥ s matrix of real numbers
having eigenvalues with negative real parts,

and f and g are nonlinear functions. That is, they are of order two or
higher in x and y, which is expressed in the following properties:
f (0, 0) = 0,

D f (0, 0) = 0,

g(0, 0) = 0,

Dg(0, 0) = 0,

(10.5)

and they are Cr , r as large as required (we will explain what this means
when we explicitly use this property later on).
With this set-up ( x, y) = (0, 0) is a fixed point for (10.4) and we are
interested in its stability properties.
The linearization of (10.4) about the fixed point is given by:
ẋ

=

Ax,

ẏ

=

By,

( x, y) 2 R c ⇥ R s .

(10.6)

The fixed point is nonhyperbolic. It has a c dimensional invariant
center subspace and a s dimensional invariant stable subspace given
by:
Ec
E

s

= {( x, y) 2 R c ⇥ R s | y = 0} ,
c

s

= {( x, y) 2 R ⇥ R | x = 0} ,

(10.7)
(10.8)

2

In fact, this is one of the main uses of
invariant manifolds. They can play an
essential role in developing dimensional
reduction schemes. The ‘’manifold” part
is important because it is desirable for
the reduced dimensional system to have
properties where the usual techniques of
calculus can be applied.

respectively.
For the nonlinear system (10.4) there is a s dimensional, Cr passing
through the origin and tangent to Es at the origin. Moreover, trajectories in the local stable manifold inherit their behavior from trajectories
in Es under the linearized dynamics in the sense that they approach
the origin at an exponential rate in time.
Similarly, there is a c dimensional Cr local center manifold that
passes through the origin and is tangent to Ec are the origin. Hence,
the center manifold has the form:
W c (0) = {( x, y) 2 R c ⇥ R s | y = h( x ), h(0) = 0, Dh(0) = 0} , (10.9)
which is valid in a neighborhood of the origin, i.e. for | x | sufficiently
small3 .
We illustrate the geometry in Fig. 10.1.

The application of the center manifold theory for analyzing the behavior of trajectories near the origin is based on three theorems:
• existence of the center manifold and the vector field restricted to the
center manifold,
• stability of the origin restricted to the center manifold and its relation to the stability of the origin in the full dimensional phase space,
• obtaining an approximation to the center manifold.
Theorem 5 (Existence and Restricted Dynamics). There exists a Cr center
manifold of ( x, y) = (0, 0) for (10.4). The dynamics of (10.4) restricted to
the center manifold is given by:
u̇ = Au + f (u, h(u)),

u 2 Rc ,

(10.10)

At this point it would be insightful to
consider (10.9) and make sure you understand how it embodies the geometrical properties of the local center manifold of the

for |u| sufficiently small.

A natural question that arises from the statement of this theorem is
‘’why did we use the variable ‘u’ when it would seem that ‘x’ would be
the more natural variable to use in this situation”? Understanding the
answer to this question will provide some insight and understanding
to the nature of solutions near the origin and the geometry of the
invariant manifolds near the origin. The answer is that ‘’ x and y are
already used as variables for describing the coordinate axes in (10.4).
We do not want to confuse a point in the center manifold with a point
on the coordinate axis. A point on the center manifold is denoted
by ( x, h( x )). The coordinate u denotes a parametric representation of
points along the center manifold. Moreover, we will want to compare
trajectories of (10.10) with trajectories in (10.4). This will be confusing
if x is used to denote a point on the center manifold. However, when
computing the center manifold and when considering the (i.e. (10.10))
it is traditional to use the coordinate ‘x’, i.e. the coordinate describing
the points in the center subspace. This does not cause ambiguities since
we can name a coordinate anything we want. However, it would cause
ambiguities when comparing trajectores in (10.4) with trajectories in
(10.10), as we do in the next theorem4 .
Theorem 6. i) Suppose that the zero solution of (10.10) is stable (asymptotically stable) (unstable), then the zero solution of (10.4) is also stable (asymptotically stable) (unstable). ii) Suppose that the zero solution of (10.10) is
stable. Then if ( x (t), y(t)) is a solution of (10.4) with ( x (0), y(0)) sufficiently small, then there is a solution u(t) of (10.10) such that as t ! •
x (t)
y(t)

= u(t) + O(e

= h(u(t)) + O(e

),
gt

),

(10.11)

where g > 0 is a constant.
Part i) of this theorem says that stability properties of the origin in
the center manifold imply the same stability properties of the origin
in the full dimensional equations. Part ii) gives much more precise
results for the case that the origin is stable. It says that trajectories
starting at initial conditions sufficiently close to the origin asymptotically approach a trajectory in the center manifold.
Now we would like to compute the center manifold so that we can
use these theorems in specific examples. In general, it is not possible to
compute the center manifold. However, it is possible to approximate
it to ‘’sufficiently high accuracy” so that we can verify the stability
results of Theorem 6 can be confirmed. We will show how this can be
done. The idea is to derive an equation that the center manifold must
satisfy, and then develop an approximate solution to that equation.

4

If this long paragraph is confusing it
would be fruitful to spend some time
considering each point. There is some
useful insight to be gained.

center manifold theory

105

We develop this approach step-by-step.
The center manifold is realized as the graph of a function,
y = h ( x ),

x 2 Rc , y 2 Rs ,

(10.12)

i.e. any point ( xc , yc ), sufficiently close to the origin, that is in the
center manifold satisfies yc = h( xc ). In addition, the center manfold
passes through the origin (h(0) = 0) and is tangent to the center subspace at the origin (Dh(0) = 0).
Invariance of the center manifold implies that the graph of the function h( x ) must also be invariant with respect to the dynamics generated by (10.4). Differentiating (10.12) with respect to time shows that
( ẋ, ẏ) at any point on the center manifold satisfies:
(10.13)

ẏ = Dh( x ) ẋ.

This is just the analytical manifestation of the fact that
invariance of a surface with respect to a vector field implies that the vector field must be tangent to the surface.5
We will now use these properties to derive an equation that must
be satisfied by the local center manifold.
The starting point is to recall that any point on the local center
manifold obeys the dynamics generated by . Substituting y = h( x )
into gives:

ẋ
ẏ

=
=

Ax + f ( x, h( x )),

(10.14)

Bh( x ) + g( x, h( x )),

c

s

( x, y) 2 R ⇥ R .

(10.15)

Substituting and into the invariance condition ẏ = Dh( x ) ẋ gives:
Bh( x ) + g( x, h( x )) = Dh( x ) ( Ax + f ( x, h( x ))) ,

(10.16)

or

Dh( x ) ( Ax + f ( x, h( x )))

Bh( x )

g( x, h( x )) ⌘ N (h( x ) = 0. (10.17)

This is an equation for h( x ). By construction, the solution implies invariance of the graph of h( x ), and we seek a solution satisfying the
additional conditions h(0) = 0 and Dh(0) = 0. The basic result on approximation of the center manifold is given by the following theorem.
Theorem 7 (Approximation). Let f : R c ! R s be a C1 mapping with
f(0) = 0,

Df(0) = 0,

5

It would be very insightful to think
about this statement in the context of
the examples from earlier chapters that
involved determining invariant sets and
invariant manifolds.

106

ordinary differential equations

such that

N (f( x )) = O(| x |q ) as x ! 0,

for some q > 1. Then

|h( x )

f( x )| = O(| x |q )

as

x ! 0.

The theorem states that if we can find an approximate solution of
(10.17) to a specified degree of accuracy, then that approximate solution is actually an approximation to the local center manifold, to the
same degree of accuracy6 .
We now consider some examples showing how these results are
applied.

which is nonhyperbolic, and therefore the linearization does not suffice to

(10.21)

We assume a center manifold of the form:
y = h( x ) = ax2 + bx3 + O( x4 ),

(10.22)

which satisfies h(0) = 0 (‘’passes through the origin”) and Dh(0) = 0
(tangent to Ec at the origin). A center manifold of this type will require the

6

This answers the question of why we
said that the original vector field, (10.4),
was Cr , ‘’r as large as required”. r will
need to be as large as needed in order to
obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation to the local center manifold. ‘’Sufficiently accurate” is determined by our
ability to deduce stability properties of
the zero solution of the vector field restricted to the center manifold.

as necessary).
Substituting this expression into the equation for the center manifold (10.17)
(using (10.21)) gives:

(2ax + 3b2 + O( x3 ))( ax4 + bx5 + O( x6 )

x5 ) + ax2 + bx3 + O( x4 ) x2 = 0.

In order for this equation to be satisfied the coefficients on each power of x
must be zero. Through third order this gives:

(10.25)

ẋ = x4 + O( x5 ).

(10.26)

Therefore the vector field restricted to the center manifold is given by:

Hence, for x sufficiently small, ẋ is positive for x 6= 0, and therefore the origin
is unstable. We illustrate the flow near the origin in Fig. 10.2.

In this problem the vector field restricted to the center manifold is two

was Lyapunov’s method and the LaSalle

A
Jacobians, Inverses of Matrices, and Eigenvalues
In this appendix we collect together some results on Jacobians and
inverses and eigenvalues of 2 ⇥ 2 matrices that are used repeatedly in
the material.
First, we consider the Taylor expansion of a vector valued function
of two variables, denoted as follows:
H ( x, y) =

f ( x, y)
g( x, y)

!

,

( x, y) 2 R2 .

(A.1)

More precisely, we will need to Taylor expand such functions through
second order:

H ( x0 + h, y0 + k) = H ( x0 , y0 ) + DH ( x0 , y0 )

h
k

!

+ O(2).

(A.2)

The Taylor expansion of a scalar valued function of one variable should
be familiar to most students at this level. Possibly there is less familiarity with the Taylor expansion of a vector valued function of a vector
variable. However, to compute this we just Taylor expand each component of the function (which is a scalar valued function of a vector
variable) in each variable, holding the other variable fixed for the expansion in that particular variable, and then we gather the results for
each component into matrix form.
Carrying this procedure out for the f ( x, y) component of (A.1) gives:

f ( x0 + h, y0 + k )

=
=

∂f
( x0 , y0 + k)h + O(h2 ),

( x0 , y0 )k + O(k2 ) + ( xo , y0 )h
∂y
∂x
f ( x0 , y0 + k ) +

+ O(hk) + O(h2 ).

(A.3)

The same procedure can be applied to g( x, y). Recombining the terms
back into the vector expresson for (A.1) gives:

ordinary differential equations

H ( x0 + h, y0 + k)

Hence, the Jacobian of (A.1) at ( x0 , y0 ) is:

∂f
∂y ( x0 , y0 )

(A.5)

which is a 2 ⇥ 2 matrix of real numbers.
We will need to compute the inverse of such matrices, as well as its
eigenvalues.
We denote a general 2 ⇥ 2 matrix of real numbers:

Let I denote the 2 ⇥ 2 identity matrix. Then the eigenvalues of A are

Integration of Some Basic Linear ODEs
In this appendix we collect together a few common ideas related to
solving, explicitly, linear inhomogeneous differential equations. Our
discussion is organized around a series of examples.
Example 32. Consider the one dimensional, autonomous linear vector field:
ẋ = ax,

x, a 2 R.

(B.1)

We often solve problems in mathematics by transforming them into simpler
problems that we already know how to solve. Towards this end, we introduce
the following (time-dependent) transformation of variables:
x = ue at .

(B.2)

Differentiating this expression with respect to t, and using (B.1), gives the
following ODE for u:
u̇ = 0,

(B.3)

which is trivial to integrate, and gives:
u ( t ) = u (0),

(B.4)

and it is easy to see from (36) that:
u (0) = x (0).

(B.5)

Using (36), as well as (B.4) and (B.5), it follows that:
x (t)e

at

= u ( t ) = u (0) = x (0),

(B.6)

x (t) = x (0)e at .

(B.7)

or

114

ordinary differential equations

Example 33. Consider the following linear inhomogeneous nonautonomous
ODE (due to the presence of the term b(t)):
ẋ = ax + b(t),

(B.8)

a, x 2 R,

where b(t) is a scalar valued function of t, whose precise properties we will
consider a bit later. We will use exactly the same strategy and change of
coordinates as in the previous example:
x = ue at .

(B.9)

Differentiating this expression with respect to t, and using (B.8), gives:
at

u̇ = e

b ( t ).

(B.10)

(Compare with (B.3).) Integrating (B.10) gives:
u ( t ) = u (0) +

Z t
0

e

at0

b(t0 )dt0 .

(B.11)

Now using (B.9) (with the consequence u(0) = x (0)) with (B.11) gives:
x (t) = x (0)e at + e at

Z t
0

at0

e

b(t0 )dt0 .

(B.12)

Finally, we return to the necessary properties of b(t) in order for this
unique solution of (B.8) to ‘’make sense”. Upon inspection of (B.12) it is
clear that all that is required is for the integrals involving b(t) to be welldefined. Continuity is a sufficient condition.
Example 34. Consider the one dimensional, nonautonomous linear vector
field:
ẋ = a(t) x,

(B.13)

x 2 R,

where a(t) is a scalar valued function of t whose precise properties will be considered later. The similarity between (B.1) and (B.13) should be evident. We
introduce the following (time-dependent) transformation of variables (compare with (36)):
x = ue

Rt
0

a(t0 )dt0

Differentiating this expression with respect to t, and substituting (B.13) into
the result gives:

integration of some basic linear odes

which reduces to:
u̇ = 0.

x ( t ) = x (0) e

(B.18)

As in the previous example, all that is required for the solution to be welldefined is for the integrals involving a(t) to exist. Continuity is a sufficient
condition.

linear vector field:
ẋ = a(t) x + b(t),

(B.19)

x 2 R,

where a(t), b(t) are scalar valued functions whose required properties will be
considered at the end of this example. We make the same transformation as
(B.14):
x = ue
from which we obtain:

As in the previous examples, that all that is required is for the integrals involving a(t) and b(t) to be well-defined. Continuity is a sufficient condition.
The previous examples were all one dimensional. Now we will
consider two n dimensional examples.

where A is a n ⇥ n matrix of real numbers. We make the following transformation of variables (compare with ):
x = e At u.

(B.26)

u̇ = 0.

(B.27)

u ( t ) = u (0).

Integrating this expression gives:

Using (B.26) with (B.28) gives:

x ( t ) = u (0) = x (0),

from which it follows that:
x (t) = e At x (0).

Example 37. Consider the n dimensional inhomogeneous nonautonomous
linear vector field:
x 2 Rn ,

ẋ = Ax + g(t),

(B.31)

where g(t) is a vector valued function of t whose required properties will
be considered later on. We use the same transformation as in the previous
example:

Finding Lyapunov Functions
Lyapunov’s method and the LaSalle invariance principle are very poweful techniques, but the obvious question always arises, ‘’how do I find
the Lyapunov function? The unfortunate answer is that given an arbitrary ODE there is no general method to find a Lyapunov function
appropriate for a given ODE for the application of these methods.
In general, to determine a Lyapunov function appropriate for a
given ODE the ODE must have a structure that lends itself to the
construction of the Lyapunov function. Therefore the next question
is ‘’what is this structure?” If the ODE arises from physical modelling
there may be an ‘’energy function” that is ‘’almost conserved”. What
this means is that when certain terms of the ODE are neglected the
resulting ODE has a conserved quantity, i.e. a scalar valued function
whose time derivative along trajectories is zero, and this conserved
quantity may be a candidate to for a Lyapunov function. If that sounds
vague it is because the construction of Lyapunov functions often requires a bit of ‘’mathematical artistry”. We will consider this procedure with some examples. Energy methods are important techniques
for understanding stability issues in science and engineering; see, for
example see the book by Langhaar1 and the article by Maschke2 .
To begin, we consider Newton’s equations for the motion of a particle of mass m under a conservative force in one dimension:
m ẍ =

dF
( x ),
dx

xR.

(C.1)

Writing this as a first order system gives:

ẋ

In terms of dynamics, the function (C.3) has the interpretation as
the conserved kinetic energy associated with (C.1).
Now we will consider several examples. In all cases we will simplify
matters by taking m = 1.

It is easy to verify that dE
dt = 0 along trajectories of (C.6).
Now we differentiate E along trajectories of (C.5) and obtain:
dE
= dy2 .
(C.8)
dt
(C.6) has only one equilibrium point located at the origin. E is clearly positive
everywhere, except for the origin, where it is zero. Using E as a Lyapunov
function we can conclude that the origin is Lyapunov stable. If we use E
to apply the LaSalle invariance principle, we can conclude that the origin is
asymptotically stable. Of course, in this case we can linearize and conclude
that the origin is a hyperbolic sink for d > 0.

It is easy to verify that dE

The question now is how we will use E to apply Lyapunov’s method or the
LaSalle invariance principle? (C.9) has three equilibrium points, a hyperbolic
saddle at the origin for d
0 and hyperbolic sinks at ( x, y) = (±1, 0) for
d > 0 and centers for d = 0. So linearization gives us complete information
for d > 0. For d = 0 linearization is sufficient to allow is to conclude that
the origin is a saddle. The equilibria ( x, y) = (±1, 0) are Lyapunov stable
for d = 0, but an argument involving the function E would be necessary in
order to conclude this. Linearization allows us to conclude that the equilibria
( x, y) = (±1, 0) are asymptotically stable for d > 0.
The function E can be used to apply the LaSalle invariance principle to
conclude that for d > 0 all trajectories approach one of the three equilibria as
t ! •.

D
Center Manifolds Depending on Parameters
In this appendix we describe the situation of center manifolds that
depend on a parameter. The theoretical framework plays an important
role in bifurcation theory.
As when we developed the theory earlier, we begin by describing
the set-up. As before, it is important to realize that when applying
these results to a vector field, it must be in the following form.

ẋ

=

Ax + f ( x, y, µ),

ẏ

=

By + g( x, y, µ),

( x, y, µ) 2 R c ⇥ R s ⇥ R p ,

(D.1)

where µ 2 R p is a vector of parameters and the matrices A and B are
have the following properties:
A
B

c ⇥ c matrix of real numbers
having eigenvalues with zero real parts,
s ⇥ s matrix of real numbers
having eigenvalues with negative real parts,

and f and g are nonlinear functions. That is, they are of order two or
higher in x, y and µ, which is expressed in the following properties:

f (0, 0, 0) = 0,

D f (0, 0, 0) = 0,

g(0, 0, 0) = 0,

Dg(0, 0, 0) = 0,

(D.2)

and they are Cr , r as large as is required to compute an adequate
approximation the center manifold. With this set-up ( x, y, µ) = (0, 0, 0)
is a fixed point for (D.1) and we are interested in its stability properties.
The conceptual ‘’trick” that reveals the nature of the parameter dependence of center manifolds is to include the parameter µ as a new
dependent variable:1

1

At this point it may be useful to go back
to the first chapter and recall how nonlinearity of an ODE is defined in terms
of the dependent variable.

ẋ

=

µ̇

ẏ

=

(D.3)

The linearization of (D.3) about the fixed point is given by:
ẋ

=

Ax,

µ̇

= 0,

ẏ

=

By,

( x, y, µ) 2 R c ⇥ R s ⇥ R p .

(D.4)

Even after increasing the dimension of the phase space by p dimensions by including the parameters as new dependent variables, the
fixed point ( x, y, µ) = (0, 0, 0) remains a nonhyperbolic fixed point. It
has a c + p dimensional invariant center subspace and a s dimensional
invariant stable subspace given by:
Ec
E

s

= {( x, y, µ) 2 R c ⇥ R s ⇥ R p | y = 0} ,
c

s

p

= {( x, y, µ) 2 R ⇥ R ⇥ R | x = 0, µ = 0} ,

(D.5)
(D.6)

respectively.
It should be clear that center manifold theory, as we have already
developed, applies to (D.3). Including the parameters, µ as additional
dependent variables has the effect of increasing the dimension of the
‘’center variables”, but there is also an important consequence. Since
µ are now dependent variables they enter in to the determination of the
nonlinear terms in the equations. In particular, terms of the form
n
xi` µm
j yk ,

now are interpreted as nonlinear terms, when ` + m + n > 1, for nonnegative integers `, m, n. We will see this in the example below.
Now we consider the information that center manifold theory provides us near the origin of (D.3).
1. In a neighborhood of the origin there exists a Cr center manifold
that is represented as the graph of a function over the center variables, h( x, µ), it passes through the origin (h(0, 0) = 0) and is tangent to the center subspace at the origin (Dh(0, 0) = 0)
2. All solutions sufficiently close to the origin are attracted to a trajectory in the center manifold at an exponential rate.
3. The center manifold can be approximated by a power series expansion.

center manifolds depending on parameters

It is significant that the center manifold is defined in a neighborhood of the origin in both the x and µ coordinates since µ = 0 is a
bifurcation value. This means that all bifurcating solutions are contained
in the center manifold. This is why, for example, that without loss of
generality bifurcations from a single zero eigenvalue can be described
by a parametrized family of one dimensional vector fields2 .
Example 40. We now consider an example which was exercise 1b from Problem Set 8.

In particular, and understanding of the
nature of bifurcation of equilibria for autonomous vector fieldscan be reduced to
a lower dimensional problem, where the
dimension of the problem is equal to
the number of eigenvalues with zero real
part.

Dynamics of Hamilton’s Equations
In this appendix we give a brief introduction to some of the characteristics and results associated with Hamiltonian differential equations
(or, Hamilton’s equations or Hamiltonian vector fields). The Hamiltonian formulation of Newton’s equations reveals a great deal of structure about dynamics and it also gives rise to a large amount of deep
mathematics that is the focus of much contemporary research. .
Our purpose here is not to derive Hamilton’s equations from Newton’s equations. Discussions of that can be found in many textbooks
on mechanics (although it is often considered ‘’advanced mechanics”).
For example, a classical exposition of this topic can be found in the
classic book of Landau1 , and more modern expositions can be found in
Abraham and Marsden2 and Arnold3 . Rather, our approach is to start
with Hamilton’s equations and to understand some simple aspects and
consequences of the special structure associated with Hamilton’s equations. Towards this end, our starting point will be Hamilton’s equations. Keeping with the simple approach throughout these lectures,
our discussion of Hamilton’s equations will be for two dimensional
systems.
We begin with a scalar valued function defined on R2
H = H (q, p),

(q, p) 2 R2 .

(E.1)

This function is referred to as the Hamiltonian. From the Hamiltonian,
Hamilton’s equations take the following form:

q̇

=

ṗ

=

∂H
(q, p),
∂p
∂H
(q, p),
∂q

(q, p) 2 R2 .

(E.2)

The form of Hamilton’s equations implies that the Hamiltonian is constant on trajectories. This can be seen from the following calculation:

(E.3)

Furthermore, this calculation implies that the level sets of the Hamiltonian are invariant manifolds. We denote the level set of the Hamiltonian as:
n
o
HE = (q, p) 2 R2 | H (q, p) = E

(E.4)

In general, the level set is a curve (or possibly an equilibrium point).
Hence, in the two dimensional case, the trajectories of Hamilton’s
equations are given by the level sets of the Hamiltonian.
The Jacobian of the Hamiltonian vector field (E.2), denoted J, is
given by:

(E.5)

at an arbitrary point (q, p) 2 R2 . Note that the trace of J (q, p), denoted
trJ (q, p), is zero. This implies that the eigenvalues of J (q, p), denoted
by l1,2 , are given by:
l1,2 = ±

q

det J (q, p),

(E.6)

where detJ (q, p) denotes the determinant of J (q, p). Therefore, if (q0 , p0 )
is an equilibrium point of (E.1) and detJ (q0 , p0 ) 6= 0, then the equilibrium point is a center for detJ (q0 , p0 ) > 0 and a saddle for detJ (q0 , p0 ) <
0. 4
Next we describe some examples of two dimensional, linear autonomous Hamiltonian vector fields.

The origin is a fixed point, and the eigenvalues associated with the linearization are given by ±l. Hence, the origin is a saddle point.The value of the
Hamiltonian at the origin is zero. We also see from (E.7) that the Hamiltonian is zero on the lines p q = 0 and p + q = 0. These are the unstable and
stable manifolds of the origin, respectively. The phase portrait is illustrated in
Fig. E.1.

The flow generated by this vector field is given in Chapter 2, Problem Set 2,
problem 5.
We will now consider two examples of bifurcation of equilibria in
two dimensional Hamiltonian systems. Bifurcation associated with
one zero eigenvalue (as we studied in Chapter 8) is not possible since,
following (E.6), if there is one zero eigenvalue the other eigenvalue
must also be zero. We will consider examples of the Hamiltonian
saddle-node and Hamiltonian pitchfork bifurcations. Discussions of
the Hamiltonian versions of these bifurcations can also be found in
Golubitsky et al.5 .

from which it follows that there are no fixed points for l < 0, one fixed
point for l = 0, and two fixed points for l > 0. This is the scenario for a
saddle-node bifurcation.

from which it follows that there is one fixed point for l < 0, one fixed point
for l = 0, and three fixed points for l > 0. This is the scenario for a pitchfork
bifurcation.

p
zero eigenvalues for l = 0. The fixed points (q, p) = ( l, 0) are centers for
l > 0. The phase portraits are shown in Fig. E.4.
We remark that, with a bit of thought, it should be clear that in two
dimensions there is no analog of the Hopf bifurcation for Hamiltonian
vector fields similar to to the situation we analyzed earlier in the nonHamiltonian context. There is a situation that is referred to as the
Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation, but this notion requires at least four
dimensions, see Van Der Meer6 .
In Hamiltonian systems a natural bifurcation parameter is the value
of the level set of the Hamiltonian, or the ‘’energy”. From this point
of view perhaps a more natural candidate for a Hopf bifurcation in
a Hamiltonian system is described by the Lyapunov subcenter theorem, see Kelley7 . The setting for this theorem also requires at least
four dimensions, but the associated phenomena occur quite often in
applications.

A Brief Introduction to the Characteristics of Chaos
In this appendix we will describe some aspects of the phenomenon
of chaos as it arises in ODEs. Chaos is one of those notable topics
that crosses disciplinary boundaries in mathematics, science, and engineering and captures the intrigue and curiousity of the general public. Numerous popularizations and histories of the topic, from different points of view, have been written; see, for example the books by
Lorenz1 , Diacu and Holmes2 , Stewart3 , and Gleick4 .
Our goal here is to introduce some of the key characteristics of chaos
based on notions that we have already developed so as to frame possible future directions of studies that the student might wish to pursue.
Our discussion will be in the setting of a flow generated by an autonomous vector field.
The phrase ‘’chaotic behavior” calls to mind a form of randomness
and unpredictability. But keep in mind, we are working in the setting
of –our ODE satisfies the criteria for existence and uniqueness of solutions. Therefore specifying the initial condition exactly implies that
the future evolution is uniquely determined, i.e. there is no ‘’randomness or unpredictability”. The key here is the word ‘’exactly”. Chaotic
systems have an intrinsic property in their dynamics that can result in
slight perturbations of the initial conditions leading to behavior, over
time, that is unlike the behavior of the trajectory though the original
initial condition. Often it is said that a chaotic system exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Now this is a lot of words
for a mathematics course. Just like when we studied stability, we will
give a mathematical definition of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and then consider the meaning of the definition in the context
of specific examples.
As mentioned above, we consider an autonomous, Cr , r 1 vector
field on R n :
ẋ = f ( x ),

x 2 Rn ,

ordinary differential equations

and we denote the flow generated by the vector field by ft (·), and we
assume that it exists for all time. We let L ⇢ R n denote an invariant
set for the flow. Then we have the following definition.
Definition 22 (Sensitive dependence on initial conditions). The flow
ft (·) is said to have sensitive dependence on initial conditions on L if there
exists e > 0 such that, for any x 2 L and any neighborhood U of x there
exists y 2 U and t > 0 such that |ft ( x ) ft (y)| > e.
Now we consider an example and analyze whether or not sensitive
dependence on initial conditions is present in the example.
Example 45. Consider the autonomous linear vector field on R2 :
ẋ

= lx,

ẏ

=

µy.

( x, y) 2 R2

(F.2)

with l, µ > 0. This is just a standard ‘’saddle point”. The origin is a fixed
point of saddle type with its stable manifold given by the y axis (i.e. x = 0)
and its unstable manifold given by the x axis (i.e. y = 0). The flow generated
by this vector field is given by:
⇣
ft ( x0 , y0 ) = x0 elt , y0 e

µt

⌘

(F.3)

Following the definition, sensitive dependence on initial conditions is defined with respect to invariant sets. Therefore we must identify the invariant
sets for which we want to determine whether or not they possess the property
of sensitive dependence on initial condition.
The simplest invariant set is the fixed point at the origin. However, that
invariant set clearly does not exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
Then we have the one dimensional stable (y axis) and unstable manifolds (x
axis). We can consider the issue of sensitive dependence on initial conditions
on these invariant sets. The stable and unstable manifolds divide the plane
into four quadrants. Each of these is an invariant set (with a segment of the
stable and unstable manifold forming part of their boundary), and the entire
plane (i.e. the entire phase space) is also an invariant set.
We consider the unstable manifold, y = 0. The flow restricted to the
unstable manifold is given by
ft ( x0 , 0) = x0 elt , 0)

(F.4)

It should be clear the the unstable manifold is an invariant set that exhibits
sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Choose an arbitrary point on the
unstable manifold, x̄1 . Consider another point arbitrarily close to x̄1 , x̄2 . Now
consider any e > 0. We have

| phit ( x̄1 , 0)

| phit ( x̄2 , 0)| = | x̄1

x̄2 |elt

(F.5)

a brief introduction to the characteristics of chaos

Now since | x̄1

x̄2 | is a fixed constant, we can clearly find a t > 0 such that

| x̄1

x̄2 |elt > e.

(F.6)

Therefore the invariant unstable manifold exhibits sensitive dependence on
initial conditions. Of course, this is not surprising because of the elt term in
the expression for the flow since this term implies exponential growth in time
of the x component of the flow.
The stable manifold,x = 0, does not exhibit sensitive dependence on initial
conditions since the restriction to the stable manifold is given by:
ft (0, y0 ) = 0, y0 e

µt

,

(F.7)

which implies that neighboring points actually get closer together as t increases.
Moreover, the term elt implies that the four quadrants separated by the
stable and unstable manifolds of the origin also exhibit sensitive dependence
on initial conditions.
Of course, we would not consider a linear autonomous ODE on the plane
having a hyperbolic saddle point to be a chaotic dynamical system, even
though it exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Therefore there
must be something more to “chaos”, and we will explore this through more
examples.
Before we consider the next example we point out two features of this example that we will consider in the context of other examples.
1. The invariant sets that we considered (with the exception of the fixed point
at the origin) were unbounded. This was a feature of the linear nature of
the vector field.
2. The ‘’separation of trajectories” occurred at an exponential rate. There was
no requirement on the ‘’rate of separation” in the definition of sensitive
dependence on initial conditions.
3. Related to these two points is the fact that trajectories continue to separate
for all time, i.e. they never again ‘’get closer” to each other.
Example 46. Consider the autonomous vector field on the cylinder:

ṙ

= 0,

q̇

= r,

(r, q ) 2 R + ⇥ S1

(F.8)

The flow generated by this vector field is given by:
ft (r0 , q0 ) = (r0 , r0 t + q0 )

(F.9)

135

136

ordinary differential equations

Note that r is constant in time. This implies that any annulus is an invariant
set. In particular, choose any r1 < r2 . Then the annulus
n
o
A ⌘ (r, q ) 2 R + ⇥ S1 | r1  r  r2 , q 2 S1

(F.10)

is a bounded invariant set.
Now choose initial conditions in A, (r10 , q1 ), (r20 , q2 ), with r1  r10 < r20 
r2 . Then we have that:

|ft (r10 , q1 )

ft (r20 , q2 )|

= | r10 , r10 t + q1
=

r10

r20 , (r10

r20 , r20 t + q2 |,

r20 )t + (q1

q2 ) .

Hence we see that the distance between trajectories will grow linearly in time,
and therefore trajectories exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
However, the distance between trajectories will not grow unboundedly (as in
the previous example). This is because q is on the circle. Trajectories will move
apart (in q, but their r values will remain constant) and then come close, then
move apart, etc. Nevertheless, this is not an example of a chaotic dynamical
system.
Example 47. Consider the following autonomous vector field defined on the
two dimensional torus (i.e. each variable is an angular variable):
q̇1

= w1 ,

q̇2

= w2 ,

( q1 , q2 ) 2 S1 . ⇥ S1

(F.11)

This vector field is an example that is considered in many dynamical systems
1
courses where it is shown that if w
w2 is an irrational number, then the trajectory through any initial condition ‘’densely fills out the torus”. This means
that given any point on the torus any trajectory will get arbitrarily close to
that point at some time of its evolution, and this ‘’close approach” will happen infinitely often. This is the classic example of an ergodic system, and this
fact is proven in many textbooks, e.g. Arnold5 or Wiggins6 . This behavior
1
is very different from the previous examples. For the case w
w2 an irrational
number, the natural invariant set to consider is the entire phase space (which
is bounded).
Next we consider the issue of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
The flow generated by this vector field is given by:
ft (q1 , q2 ) = (w1 t + q1 , w2 t + q2 ) .

(F.12)

We choose two initial conditions, (q1 , q2 ), (q10 , q20 ). Then we have

|ft (q1 , q2 )

ft (q10 , q20 )|

= | ( w1 t + q 1 , w2 t + q 2 )
= |(q1

q10 , q2

q20 )|,

w1 t + q10 , w2 t + q20 |,

a brief introduction to the characteristics of chaos

and therefore trajectories always maintain the same distance from each other
during the course of their evolution.
Sometimes it is said that chaotic systems contain an infinite number
of unstable periodic orbits. We consider an example.
Example 48. Consider the following two dimensional autonomous vector
field on the cylinder:
p
,
r
r, (r, q ) 2 R + ⇥ S1 .

ṙ

= sin

q̇

=

Equilibrium points of the ṙ component of this vector field correspond to periodic orbits. These equilibrium points are given by
r=

1
,
n

n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .

(F.13)

Stability of the periodic orbits can be determined by computing the Jacobian of
the ṙ component of the equation and evaluating it on the periodic orbit. This
is given by:
p
p
cos ,
r
r2
and evaluating this on the periodic orbits gives;
p
( 1) n
n2
Therefore all of these periodic orbits are hyperbolic and stable for n even and
unstable for n odd. This is an example of a two dimensional autonomous
vector field that contains an infinite number of unstable hyperbolic periodic
orbits in a bounded region, yet it is not chaotic.
Now we consider what we have learned from these four examples.
In example 45 we identified invariant sets on which the trajectories
exhibited sensitive dependence on initial conditions (i.e. trajectories
separated at an exponential rate), but those invariant sets were unbounded, and the trajectories also became unbounded. This illustrates
why boundedness is part of the definition of invariant set in the context of chaotic systems.
In example 46 we identified an invariant set, A, on which all trajectories were bounded and they exhibited sensitive dependence on
initial conditions, although they only separated linearly in time. However, the r coordinates of all trajectories remained constant, indicating
that trajectories were constrained to lie on circles (‘’invariant circles”)
within A.

In example 47, for w
w2 an irrational number, every trajectory densely
fills out the entire phase space, the torus (which is bounded). However, the trajectories did not exhibit sensitive dependence on initial
conditions.
Finally, in example 48 we gave an example having an infinite number of unstable hyperbolic orbits in a bounded region of the phase
space. We did not explicitly examine the issue of sensitive dependence
on initial conditions for this example.
So what characteristics would we require of a chaotic invariant set?
A combination of examples 45 and 47 would capture many manifestations of ‘’chaotic invariant sets”:

1. the invariant set is bounded,
2. every trajectory comes arbitrarily close to every point in the invariant set during the course of its evolution in time, and
3. every trajectory has sensitive dependence on initial condition.
While simple to state, developing a unique mathematical framework that makes these three criteria mathematically rigorous, and provides a way to verify them in particular examples, is not so straightforward.
Property 1 is fairly straightforward, once we have identified a candidate invariant set (which can be very difficult in explicit ODEs). If the
phase space is equipped with a norm, then we have a way of verifying
whether or not the invariant set is bounded.
Property 2 is very difficult to verify, as well as to develop a universally accepted definition amongst mathematicians as to what it means
for ‘’every trajectory to come arbitrarily close to every point in phase
space during the course of its evolution”. Its definition is understood
within the context of recurrence properties of trajectories. Those can
be studied from either the topological point of view (see Akin7 ). or
from the point of view of ergodic theory (see Katok and Hasselblatt8
or Brin and Stuck9 ). The settings for both of these points of view
utilize different mathematical structures (topology in the former case,
measure theory in the latter case). A book that describes how both of
these points of view are used in the application of mixing is Sturman
et al.10 .
Verifying that Property 3 holds for all trajectories is also not straightforward. What ‘’all” means is different in the topological setting (‘’open
set”, Baire category) and the ergodic theoretic setting (sets of ‘’full
measure”). What ‘’sensitive dependence on initial conditions” means
is also different in each setting. The definition we gave above was
more in the spirit of the topological point of view (no specific ‘’rate of
separation” was given) and the ergodic theoretic framework focuses

a brief introduction to the characteristics of chaos

on Lyapunov exponents (‘’Lyapunov’s first method”) and exponential
rate of separation of trajectories.
Therefore we have not succeeded in giving a specific example of
an ODE whose trajectories behave in a chaotic fashion. We have been
able to describe some of the issues, but the details will be left for other
courses (which could be either courses in dynamical systems theory
or ergodic theory or, ideally, a bit of both). But we have illustrated just
how difficult it can be to formulate mathematically precise definitions
that can be verified in specific examples.
All of our examples above were two dimensional, autonomous vector fields. The type of dynamics that can be exhibited by such systems is very limited, according to the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem (see
Hirsch et al.11 or Wiggins12 ). There are a number of variations of this
theorem, so we will leave the exploration of this theorem to the interested student.
