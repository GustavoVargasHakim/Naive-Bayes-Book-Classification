Note to Students
This book may be different than other mathematics textbooks you have used since
one of the main goals of this book is to help you to develop the ability to construct
and write mathematical proofs. So this book is not just about mathematical content
but is also about the process of doing mathematics. Along the way, you will also
learn some important mathematical topics that will help you in your future study
of mathematics.
This book is designed not to be just casually read but rather to be engaged. It
may seem like a clicheÃÅ (because it is in almost every mathematics book now) but
there is truth in the statement that mathematics is not a spectator sport. To learn and
understand mathematics, you must engage in the process of doing mathematics. So
you must actively read and study the book, which means to have a pencil and paper
with you and be willing to follow along and fill in missing details. This type of
engagement is not easy and is often frustrating, but if you do so, you will learn a
great deal about mathematics and more importantly, about doing mathematics.
Recognizing that actively studying a mathematics book is often not easy, several features of the textbook have been designed to help you become more engaged
as you study the material. Some of the features are:
 Preview Activities. With the exception of Sections 1.1 and 3.6, each section
has exactly two preview activities. Some Preview Activities will review prior
mathematical work that is necessary for the new section. This prior work
may contain material from previous mathematical courses or it may contain
material covered earlier in this text. Other preview activities will introduce
new concepts and definitions that will be used when that section is discussed
in class. It is very important that you work on these preview activities before
starting the rest of the section. Please note that answers to these preview
activities are not included in the text. This book is designed to be used for
a course and it is left up to the discretion of each individual instructor as to
how to distribute the answers to the preview activities.
vi

Note to Students

 Progress Checks. Several Progress Checks are included in each section.
These are either short exercises or short activities designed to help you determine if you are understanding the material as you are studying the material
in the section. As such, it is important to work through these progress checks
to test your understanding, and if necessary, study the material again before
proceeding further. So it is important to attempt these progress checks before
checking the answers, which are are provided in Appendix B.
 Chapter Summaries. To assist you with studying the material in the text,
there is a summary at the end of each chapter. The summaries usually list
the important definitions introduced in the chapter and the important results
proven in the chapter. If appropriate, the summary also describes the important proof techniques discussed in the chapter.
 Answers for Selected Exercises. Answers or hints for several exercises are
included in an Appendix C. Those exercises with an answer or a hint in the
appendix are preceded by a star .? /. The main change in Version 2.0 of this
textbook from the previous versions is the addition of more exercises with
answers or hints in the appendix.
Although not part of the textbook, there are now 107 online videos with about
14 hours of content that span the first seven chapters of this book. These videos
are freely available online at Grand Valley‚Äôs Department of Mathematics YouTube
channel on this playlist:
http://gvsu.edu/s/0l1
These online videos were created and developed by Dr. Robert Talbert of Grand
Valley State University.
There is also a website for the textbook. For this website, go to
www.tedsundstrom.com
and click on the TEXTBOOKS button in the upper right corner.
You may find some things there that could be of help. For example, there
currently is a link to study guides for the sections of this textbook. Good luck
with your study of mathematics and please make use of the online videos and the
resources available in the textbook and at the website for the textbook. If there are
things that you think would be good additions to the book or the web site, please
feel free to send me a message at mathreasoning@gmail.com.

Preface
Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof is designed to be a text for the first
course in the college mathematics curriculum that introduces students to the processes of constructing and writing proofs and focuses on the formal development
of mathematics. The primary goals of the text are to help students:
 Develop logical thinking skills and to develop the ability to think more abstractly in a proof oriented setting.
 Develop the ability to construct and write mathematical proofs using standard methods of mathematical proof including direct proofs, proof by contradiction, mathematical induction, case analysis, and counterexamples.
 Develop the ability to read and understand written mathematical proofs.
 Develop talents for creative thinking and problem solving.
 Improve their quality of communication in mathematics. This includes improving writing techniques, reading comprehension, and oral communication in mathematics.
 Better understand the nature of mathematics and its language.
Another important goal of this text is to provide students with material that will be
needed for their further study of mathematics.
This type of course has now become a standard part of the mathematics major at
many colleges and universities. It is often referred to as a ‚Äútransition course‚Äù from
the calculus sequence to the upper-level courses in the major. The transition is from
the problem-solving orientation of calculus to the more abstract and theoretical
upper-level courses. This is needed today because many students complete their
study of calculus without seeing a formal proof or having constructed a proof of
their own. This is in contrast to many upper-level mathematics courses, where
viii

Preface

ix

the emphasis is on the formal development of abstract mathematical ideas, and
the expectations are that students will be able to read and understand proofs and be
able to construct and write coherent, understandable mathematical proofs. Students
should be able to use this text with a background of one semester of calculus.

Important Features of the Book
Following are some of the important features of this text that will help with the
transition from calculus to upper-level mathematics courses.
1. Emphasis on Writing in Mathematics
Issues dealing with writing mathematical exposition are addressed throughout the book. Guidelines for writing mathematical proofs are incorporated
into the book. These guidelines are introduced as needed and begin in Section 1.2. Appendix A contains a summary of all the guidelines for writing
mathematical proofs that are introduced throughout the text. In addition, every attempt has been made to ensure that every completed proof presented in
this text is written according to these guidelines. This provides students with
examples of well-written proofs.
One of the motivating factors for writing this book was to develop a textbook
for the course ‚ÄúCommunicating in Mathematics‚Äù at Grand Valley State University. This course is part of the university‚Äôs Supplemental Writing Skills
Program, and there was no text that dealt with writing issues in mathematics
that was suitable for this course. This is why some of the writing guidelines
in the text deal with the use of LATEXor a word processor that is capable of
producing the appropriate mathematical symbols and equations. However,
the writing guidelines can easily be implemented for courses where students
do not have access to this type of word processing.
2. Instruction in the Process of Constructing Proofs
One of the primary goals of this book is to develop students‚Äô abilities to
construct mathematical proofs. Another goal is to develop their abilities to
write the proof in a coherent manner that conveys an understanding of the
proof to the reader. These are two distinct skills.
Instruction on how to write proofs begins in Section 1.2 and is developed further in Chapter 3. In addition, Chapter 4 is devoted to developing students‚Äô
abilities to construct proofs using mathematical induction.

x

Preface
Students are introduced to a method to organize their thought processes when
attempting to construct a proof that uses a so-called know-show table. (See
Section 1.2 and Section 3.1.) Students use this table to work backward from
what it is they are trying to prove while at the same time working forward
from the assumptions of the problem. The know-show tables are used quite
extensively in Chapters 1 and 3. However, the explicit use of know-show tables is gradually reduced and these tables are rarely used in the later chapters.
One reason for this is that these tables may work well when there appears
to be only one way of proving a certain result. As the proofs become more
complicated or other methods of proof (such as proofs using cases) are used,
these know-show tables become less useful.
So the know-show tables are not to be considered an absolute necessity in
using the text. However, they are useful for students beginning to learn how
to construct and write proofs. They provide a convenient way for students to
organize their work. More importantly, they introduce students to a way of
thinking about a problem. Instead of immediately trying to write a complete
proof, the know-show table forces students to stop, think, and ask questions
such as
 Just exactly what is it that I am trying to prove?
 How can I prove this?
 What methods do I have that may allow me to prove this?
 What are the assumptions?
 How can I use these assumptions to prove the result?
Being able to ask these questions is a big step in constructing a proof. The
next task is to answer the questions and to use those answers to construct a
proof.
3. Emphasis on Active Learning
One of the underlying premises of this text is that the best way to learn and
understand mathematics is to be actively involved in the learning process.
However, it is unlikely that students will learn all the mathematics in a given
course on their own. Students actively involved in learning mathematics
need appropriate materials that will provide guidance and support in their
learning of mathematics. There are several ways this text promotes activite
learning.

Preface

xi
 With the exception of Sections 1.1 and 3.6, each section has exactly
two preview activities. These Preview Activities should be completed
by the students prior to the classroom discussion of the section. The
purpose of the Preview Activities is to prepare students to participate
in the classroom discussion of the section. Some Preview Activities
will review prior mathematical work that is necessary for the new section. This prior work may contain material from previous mathematical courses or it may contain material covered earlier in this text. Other
preview activities will introduce new concepts and definitions that will
be used when that section is discussed in class.
 Several Progress Checks are included in each section. These are either
short exercises or short activities designed to help the students determine if they are understanding the material as it is presented. Some
progress checks are also intended to prepare the student for the next
topic in the section. Answers to the Progress Checks are provided in
Appendix B.
 Explorations and activities are included at the end of the exercises of
each section. These activities can be done individually or in a collaborative learning setting, where students work in groups to brainstorm,
make conjectures, test each others‚Äô ideas, reach consensus, and, it is
hoped, develop sound mathematical arguments to support their work.
These activities can also be assigned as homework in addition to the
other exercises at the end of each section.

4. Other Important Features of the Book
 Several sections of the text include exercises called Evaluation of Proofs.
(The first such exercise appears in Section 3.1.) For these exercises,
there is a proposed proof of a proposition. However, the proposition
may be true or may be false. If a proposition is false, the proposed proof
is, of course, incorrect, and the student is asked to find the error in the
proof and then provide a counterexample showing that the proposition
is false. However, if the proposition is true, the proof may be incorrect
or not well written. In keeping with the emphasis on writing, students
are then asked to correct the proof and/or provide a well-written proof
according to the guidelines established in the book.
 To assist students with studying the material in the text, there is a summary at the end of each chapter. The summaries usually list the important definitions introduced in the chapter and the important results

xii

Preface
proven in the chapter. If appropriate, the summary also describes the
important proof techniques discussed in the chapter.
 Answers or hints for several exercises are included in an appendix. This
was done in response to suggestions from many students at Grand Valley and some students from other institutions who were using the book.
In addition, those exercises with an answer or a hint in the appendix are
preceded by a star .? /.

Content and Organization
Mathematical content is needed as a vehicle for learning how to construct and write
proofs. The mathematical content for this text is drawn primarily from elementary
number theory, including congruence arithmetic; elementary set theory; functions,
including injections, surjections, and the inverse of a function; relations and equivalence relations; further topics in number theory such as greatest common divisors
and prime factorizations; and cardinality of sets, including countable and uncountable sets. This material was chosen because it can be used to illustrate a broad
range of proof techniques and it is needed as a prerequisite for many upper-level
mathematics courses.
The chapters in the text can roughly be divided into the following classes:
 Constructing and Writing Proofs: Chapters 1, 3, and 4
 Logic: Chapter 2
 Mathematical Content: Chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
The first chapter sets the stage for the rest of the book. It introduces students to
the use of conditional statements in mathematics, begins instruction in the process
of constructing a direct proof of a conditional statement, and introduces many of
the writing guidelines that will be used throughout the rest of the book. This is not
meant to be a thorough introduction to methods of proof. Before this is done, it is
necessary to introduce the students to the parts of logic that are needed to aid in the
construction of proofs. This is done in Chapter 2.
Students need to learn some logic and gain experience in the traditional language and proof methods used in mathematics. Since this is a text that deals with
constructing and writing mathematical proofs, the logic that is presented in Chapter 2 is intended to aid in the construction of proofs. The goals are to provide

Preface

xiii

students with a thorough understanding of conditional statements, quantifiers, and
logical equivalencies. Emphasis is placed on writing correct and useful negations
of statements, especially those involving quantifiers. The logical equivalencies that
are presented provide the logical basis for some of the standard proof techniques,
such as proof by contrapositive, proof by contradiction, and proof using cases.
The standard methods for mathematical proofs are discussed in detail in Chapter 3. The mathematical content that is introduced to illustrate these proof methods
includes some elementary number theory, including congruence arithmetic. These
concepts are used consistently throughout the text as a way to demonstrate ideas in
direct proof, proof by contrapositive, proof by contradiction, proof using cases, and
proofs using mathematical induction. This gives students a strong introduction to
important mathematical ideas while providing the instructor a consistent reference
point and an example of how mathematical notation can greatly simplify a concept.
The three sections of Chapter 4 are devoted to proofs using mathematical induction. Again, the emphasis is not only on understanding mathematical induction
but also on developing the ability to construct and write proofs that use mathematical induction.
The last five chapters are considered ‚Äúmathematical content‚Äù chapters. Concepts of set theory are introduced in Chapter 5, and the methods of proof studied
in Chapter 3 are used to prove results about sets and operations on sets. The idea
of an ‚Äúelement-chasing proof‚Äù is also introduced in Section 5.2.
Chapter 6 provides a thorough study of functions. Functions are studied before relations in order to begin with the more specific notion with which students
have some familiarity and move toward the more general notion of a relation. The
concept of a function is reviewed but with attention paid to being precise with
terminology and is then extended to the general definition of a function. Various
proof techniques are employed in the study of injections, surjections, composition
of functions, inverses of functions, and functions acting on sets.
Chapter 7 introduces the concepts of relations and equivalence relations. Section 7.4 is included to provide a link between the concept of an equivalence relation
and the number theory that has been discussed throughout the text.
Chapter 8 continues the study of number theory. The highlights include problems dealing with greatest common divisors, prime numbers, the Fundamental
Theorem of Arithmetic, and linear Diophantine equations.
Finally, Chapter 9 deals with further topics in set theory, focusing on cardinality, finite sets, countable sets, and uncountable sets.

Preface

Designing a Course
Most instructors who use this text will design a course specifically suited to their
needs and the needs of their institution. However, a standard one-semester course
in constructing and writing proofs could cover the first six chapters of the text and
at least one of Chapter 7, Chapter 8, or Chapter 9. Please note that Sections 4.3,
5.5, 6.6, 7.4, and 8.3 can be considered optional sections. These are interesting
sections that contain important material, but the content of these sections is not
essential to study the material in the rest of the book.

Introduction to
Writing Proofs in Mathematics
1.1

Statements and Conditional Statements

Much of our work in mathematics deals with statements. In mathematics, a statement is a declarative sentence that is either true or false but not both. A statement
is sometimes called a proposition. The key is that there must be no ambiguity. To
be a statement, a sentence must be true or false, and it cannot be both. So a sentence such as ‚ÄúThe sky is beautiful‚Äù is not a statement since whether the sentence
is true or not is a matter of opinion. A question such as ‚ÄúIs it raining?‚Äù is not a
statement because it is a question and is not declaring or asserting that something
is true.
Some sentences that are mathematical in nature often are not statements because we may not know precisely what a variable represents. For example, the
equation 2x C 5 D 10 is not a statement since we do not know what x represents.
If we substitute a specific value for x (such as x D 3), then the resulting equation,
2  3 C 5 D 10 is a statement (which is a false statement). Following are some more
examples:

 There exists a real number x such that 2x C 5 D 10.
This is a statement because either such a real number exists or such a real
number does not exist. In this case, this is a true statement since such a real
number does exist, namely x D 2:5.

This is a statement since either the sentence 2x C 5 D 2 x C

when any real number is substituted for x (in which case, the statement is
true) or there is at least one real number that can be substituted for x and
produce a false statement (in which case, the statement is false). In this case,
the given statement is true.

 Solve the equation x 2 7x C 10 D 0.
This is not a statement since it is a directive. It does not assert that something
is true.
 .a C b/2 D a2 C b 2 is not a statement since it is not known what a and b
represent. However, the sentence, ‚ÄúThere exist real numbers a and b such
that .a C b/2 D a2 C b 2 ‚Äù is a statement. In fact, this is a true statement since
there are such integers. For example, if a D 1 and b D 0, then .a C b/2 D
a2 C b 2 .
 Compare the statement in the previous item to the statement, ‚ÄúFor all real
numbers a and b, .a C b/2 D a2 C b 2 .‚Äù This is a false statement since there
are values for a and b for which .a C b/2 ¬§ a2 C b 2 . For example, if a D 2
and b D 3, then .a C b/2 D 52 D 25 and a2 C b 2 D 22 C 32 D 13.

How Do We Decide If a Statement Is True or False?
In mathematics, we often establish that a statement is true by writing a mathematical proof. To establish that a statement is false, we often find a so-called counterexample. (These ideas will be explored later in this chapter.) So mathematicians
must be able to discover and construct proofs. In addition, once the discovery has
been made, the mathematician must be able to communicate this discovery to others who speak the language of mathematics. We will be dealing with these ideas
throughout the text.
For now, we want to focus on what happens before we start a proof. One thing
that mathematicians often do is to make a conjecture beforehand as to whether
the statement is true or false. This is often done through exploration. The role of
exploration in mathematics is often difficult because the goal is not to find a specific
answer but simply to investigate. Following are some techniques of exploration that
might be helpful.

Techniques of Exploration
 Guesswork and conjectures. Formulate and write down questions and conjectures. When we make a guess in mathematics, we usually call it a conjecture.
 Examples. Constructing appropriate examples is extremely important.
Exploration often requires looking at lots of examples. In this way, we can
gather information that provides evidence that a statement is true, or we
might find an example that shows the statement is false. This type of example is called a counterexample.
For example, if someone makes the conjecture that sin.2x/ D 2 sin.x/, for
all real numbers x, we can test this conjecture by substituting specific values

4

Chapter 1. Introduction to Writing Proofs in Mathematics
for x. One way to do this is to choose values of x for which sin.x/ is known.

Using x D , we see that

Since 1 ¬§ 2, these calculations show that this conjecture is false. However, if we do not find a counterexample for a conjecture, we usually cannot
claim the conjecture is true. The best we can say is that our examples indicate the conjecture is true. As an example, consider the conjecture that
If x and y are odd integers, then x C y is an even integer.
We can do lots of calculations, such as 3 C 7 D 10 and 5 C 11 D 16, and find
that every time we add two odd integers, the sum is an even integer. However,
it is not possible to test every pair of odd integers, and so we can only say
that the conjecture appears to be true. (We will prove that this statement is
true in the next section.)
 Use of prior knowledge. This also is very important. We cannot start from
square one every time we explore a statement. We must make use of our acquired mathematical knowledge. For the conjecture that sin .2x/ D 2 sin.x/,
for all real numbers x, we might recall that there are trigonometric identities
called ‚Äúdouble angle identities.‚Äù We may even remember the correct identity
for sin .2x/, but if we do not, we can always look it up. We should recall (or
find) that
for all real numbers x; sin.2x/ D 2 sin.x/cos.x/:
We could use this identity to argue that the conjecture ‚Äúfor all real numbers
x, sin.2x/ D 2 sin.x/‚Äù is false, but if we do, it is still a good idea to give a
specific counterexample as we did before.
 Cooperation and brainstorming. Working together is often more fruitful
than working alone. When we work with someone else, we can compare
notes and articulate our ideas. Thinking out loud is often a useful brainstorming method that helps generate new ideas.

Conditional Statements
One of the most frequently used types of statements in mathematics is the so-called
conditional statement. Given statements P and Q, a statement of the form ‚ÄúIf P
then Q‚Äù is called a conditional statement. It seems reasonable that the truth value
(true or false) of the conditional statement ‚ÄúIf P then Q‚Äù depends on the truth values of P and Q. The statement ‚ÄúIf P then Q‚Äù means that Q must be true whenever
P is true. The statement P is called the hypothesis of the conditional statement,
and the statement Q is called the conclusion of the conditional statement. Since
conditional statements are probably the most important type of statement in mathematics, we give a more formal definition.
Definition. A conditional statement is a statement that can be written in
the form ‚ÄúIf P then Q,‚Äù where P and Q are sentences. For this conditional
statement, P is called the hypothesis and Q is called the conclusion.
Intuitively, ‚ÄúIf P then Q‚Äù means that Q must be true whenever P is true.
Because conditional statements are used so often, a symbolic shorthand notation is
used to represent the conditional statement ‚ÄúIf P then Q.‚Äù We will use the notation
P ! Q to represent ‚ÄúIf P then Q.‚Äù When P and Q are statements, it seems
reasonable that the truth value (true or false) of the conditional statement P ! Q
depends on the truth values of P and Q. There are four cases to consider:
 P is true and Q is true.

 P is false and Q is true.

 P is true and Q is false.

 P is false and Q is false.

6

Chapter 1. Introduction to Writing Proofs in Mathematics

The conditional statement P ! Q means that Q is true whenever P is true.
It says nothing about the truth value of Q when P is false. Using this as a guide,
we define the conditional statement P ! Q to be false only when P is true and
Q is false, that is, only when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false. In
all other cases, P ! Q is true. This is summarized in Table 1.1, which is called
a truth table for the conditional statement P ! Q. (In Table 1.1, T stands for
‚Äútrue‚Äù and F stands for ‚Äúfalse.‚Äù)

Table 1.1: Truth Table for P ! Q
The important thing to remember is that the conditional statement P ! Q
has its own truth value. It is either true or false (and not both). Its truth value
depends on the truth values for P and Q, but some find it a bit puzzling that the
conditional statement is considered to be true when the hypothesis P is false. We
will provide a justification for this through the use of an example.
Example 1.3 Suppose that I say
‚ÄúIf it is not raining, then Daisy is riding her bike.‚Äù
We can represent this conditional statement as P ! Q where P is the statement,
‚ÄúIt is not raining‚Äù and Q is the statement, ‚ÄúDaisy is riding her bike.‚Äù
Although it is not a perfect analogy, think of the statement P ! Q as being
false to mean that I lied and think of the statement P ! Q as being true to mean
that I did not lie. We will now check the truth value of P ! Q based on the truth
values of P and Q.
1. Suppose that both P and Q are true. That is, it is not raining and Daisy is
riding her bike. In this case, it seems reasonable to say that I told the truth
and that P ! Q is true.
2. Suppose that P is true and Q is false or that it is not raining and Daisy is not
riding her bike. It would appear that by making the statement, ‚ÄúIf it is not

1.1. Statements and Conditional Statements

7

raining, then Daisy is riding her bike,‚Äù that I have not told the truth. So in
this case, the statement P ! Q is false.
3. Now suppose that P is false and Q is true or that it is raining and Daisy
is riding her bike. Did I make a false statement by stating that if it is not
raining, then Daisy is riding her bike? The key is that I did not make any
statement about what would happen if it was raining, and so I did not tell
a lie. So we consider the conditional statement, ‚ÄúIf it is not raining, then
Daisy is riding her bike,‚Äù to be true in the case where it is raining and Daisy
is riding her bike.
4. Finally, suppose that both P and Q are false. That is, it is raining and Daisy
is not riding her bike. As in the previous situation, since my statement was
P ! Q, I made no claim about what would happen if it was raining, and so
I did not tell a lie. So the statement P ! Q cannot be false in this case and
so we consider it to be true.
Progress Check 1.4 (Explorations with Conditional Statements)
1. Consider the following sentence:
If x is a positive real number, then x 2 C 8x is a positive real number.
Although the hypothesis and conclusion of this conditional sentence are not
statements, the conditional sentence itself can be considered to be a statement as long as we know what possible numbers may be used for the variable x. From the context of this sentence, it seems that we can substitute any
positive real number for x. We can also substitute 0 for x or a negative real
number for x provided that we are willing to work with a false hypothesis
in the conditional statement. (In Chapter 2, we will learn how to be more
careful and precise with these types of conditional statements.)
(a) Notice that if x D 3, then x 2 C 8x D 15, which is negative. Does
this mean that the given conditional statement is false?
(b) Notice that if x D 4, then x 2 C 8x D 48, which is positive. Does this
mean that the given conditional statement is true?
(c) Do you think this conditional statement is true or false? Record the
results for at least five different examples where the hypothesis of this
conditional statement is true.

8

Chapter 1. Introduction to Writing Proofs in Mathematics
2. ‚ÄúIf n is a positive integer, then .n2 nC 41/ is a prime number.‚Äù (Remember
that a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 whose only positive
factors are 1 and itself.)
To explore whether or not this statement is true, try using (and recording
your results) for n D 1, n D 2, n D 3, n D 4, n D 5, and n D 10. Then
record the results for at least four other values of n. Does this conditional
statement appear to be true?

Further Remarks about Conditional Statements
1. The conventions for the truth value of conditional statements may seem a
bit strange,especially the fact that the conditional statement is true when the
hypothesis of the conditional statement is false. The following example is
meant to show that this makes sense.
Suppose that Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet. The following four statements will use the four possible truth combinations for the hypothesis and
conclusion of a conditional statement.
 If Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet, then he has $20 in his wallet. This
is a true statement. Notice that both the hypothesis and the conclusion
are true.
 If Ed has exactly $52 in his wallet, then he has $100 in his wallet. This
statement is false. Notice that the hypothesis is true and the conclusion
is false.
 If Ed has $100 in his wallet, then he has at least $50 in his wallet. This
statement is true regardless of how much money he has in his wallet.
In this case, the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true.
 If Ed has $100 in his wallet, then he has at least $80 in his wallet. This
statement is true regardless of how much money he has in his wallet.
In this case, the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is false.
This is admittedly a contrived example but it does illustrate that the conventions for the truth value of a conditional statement make sense. The message
is that in order to be complete in mathematics, we need to have conventions
about when a conditional statement is true and when it is false.
2. The fact that there is only one case when a conditional statement is false often
provides a method to show that a given conditional statement is false. In

1.1. Statements and Conditional Statements

Progress Check 1.4, you were asked if you thought the following conditional
statement was true or false.

n C 41 is a prime number.

If n is a positive integer, then n2


Perhaps for all of the values you tried for n, n2 n C 41 turned out to be
a prime number. However, if we try n D 41, we get
n2
2

n

n C 41 D 412
2

n C 41 D 41 :

41 C 41

So in the case where n D 41, the hypothesisis true (41 is a positive integer)
and the conclusion is false 412 is not prime . Therefore, 41 is a counterexample for this conjecture and the conditional statement
‚ÄúIf n is a positive integer, then n2


n C 41 is a prime number‚Äù

is false. There are other counterexamples (such as n D 42, n D 45, and
n D 50), but only one counterexample is needed to prove that the statement
is false.
3. Although one example can be used to prove that a conditional statement is
false, in most cases, we cannot use examples to prove that a conditional
statement is true. For example, in Progress Check 1.4, we substituted values for x for the conditional statement ‚ÄúIf x is a positive real number, then
x 2 C 8x is a positive real number.‚Äù For every positive real number used
for x, we saw that x 2 C 8x was positive. However, this does not prove the
conditional statement to be true because it is impossible to substitute every
positive real number for x. So, although we may believe this statement is
true, to be able to conclude it is true, we need to write a mathematical proof.
Methods of proof will be discussed in Section 1.2 and Chapter 3.

Progress Check 1.5 (Working with a Conditional Statement)
Sometimes, we must be aware of conventions that are being used. In most calculus
texts, the convention is that any function has a domain and a range that are subsets
of the real numbers. In addition, when we say something like ‚Äúthe function f is
differentiable at a‚Äù, it is understood that a is a real number. With these conventions,
the following statement is a true statement, which is proven in many calculus texts.
If the function f is differentiable at a, then the function f is continuous at a.

Using only this true statement, is it possible to make a conclusion about the function in each of the following cases?

Closure Properties of Number Systems
The primary number system used in algebra and calculus is the real number system. We usually use the symbol R to stand for the set of all real numbers. The real
numbers consist of the rational numbers and the irrational numbers. The rational
numbers are those real numbers that can be written as a quotient of two integers
(with a nonzero denominator), and the irrational numbers are those real numbers
that cannot be written as a quotient of two integers. That is, a rational number can
be written in the form of a fraction, and an irrational number cannot
be written in
p
the form of a fraction. Some common irrational numbers are 2, , and e. We
usually use the symbol Q to represent the set of all rational numbers. (The letter
Q is used because rational numbers are quotients of integers.) There is no standard
symbol for the set of all irrational numbers.
Perhaps the most basic number system used in mathematics is the set of natural numbers. The natural numbers consist of the positive whole numbers such
as 1, 2, 3, 107, and 203. We will use the symbol N to stand for the set of natural
numbers. Another basic number system that we will be working with is the set of
integers. The integers consist of zero, the positive whole numbers, and the negan
tives of the positive whole numbers. If n is an integer, we can write n D . So
1
each integer is a rational number and hence also a real number.
We will use the letter Z to stand for the set of integers. (The letter Z is from the
German word, Zahlen, for numbers.) Three of the basic properties of the integers
are that the set Z is closed under addition, the set Z is closed under multiplication, and the set of integers is closed under subtraction. This means that
 If x and y are integers, then x C y is an integer;

1.1. Statements and Conditional Statements

11

 If x and y are integers, then x  y is an integer; and
 If x and y are integers, then x

y is an integer.

Notice that these so-called closure properties are defined in terms of conditional
statements. This means that if we can find one instance where the hypothesis is true
and the conclusion is false, then the conditional statement is false.
Example 1.6 (Closure)
1. In order for the set of natural numbers to be closed under subtraction, the
following conditional statement would have to be true: If x and y are natural
numbers, then x y is a natural number. However, since 5 and 8 are natural numbers, 5 8 D 3, which is not a natural number, this conditional
statement is false. Therefore, the set of natural numbers is not closed under
subtraction.
2. We can use the rules for multiplying fractions and the closure rules for the
integers to show that the rational numbers are closed under multiplication. If
c
a
and are rational numbers (so a, b, c, and d are integers and b and d are
b
d
not zero), then
a c
ac
 D
:
b d
bd
Since the integers are closed under multiplication, we know that ac and bd
ac
are integers and since b ¬§ 0 and d ¬§ 0, bd ¬§ 0. Hence,
is a rational
bd
number and this shows that the rational numbers are closed under multiplication.

show that certain statements were false and to make conjectures that certain
statements were true. We can also use exploration to formulate a conjecture

Constructing Direct Proofs

Preview Activity 1 (Definition of Even and Odd Integers)
Definitions play a very important role in mathematics. A direct proof of a proposition in mathematics is often a demonstration that the proposition follows logically
from certain definitions and previously proven propositions. A definition is an
agreement that a particular word or phrase will stand for some object, property, or
other concept that we expect to refer to often. In many elementary proofs, the answer to the question, ‚ÄúHow do we prove a certain proposition?‚Äù, is often answered
by means of a definition. For example, in Progress Check 1.2 on page 5, all of the
examples you tried should have indicated that the following conditional statement
is true:
If x and y are odd integers, then x  y is an odd integer.
In order to construct a mathematical proof of this conditional statement, we need
a precise definition of what it means to say that an integer is an even integer and
what it means to say that an integer is an odd integer.
Definition. An integer a is an even integer provided that there exists an
integer n such that a D 2n. An integer a is an odd integer provided there
exists an integer n such that a D 2n C 1.

16

Chapter 1. Introduction to Writing Proofs in Mathematics

Using this definition, we can conclude that the integer 16 is an even integer since
16 D 2  8 and 8 is an integer. By answering the following questions, you should
obtain a better understanding of these definitions. These questions are not here just
to have questions in the textbook. Constructing and answering such questions is
a way in which many mathematicians will try to gain a better understanding of a
definition.
1. Use the definitions given above to
(a) Explain why 28, 42, 24, and 0 are even integers.
(b) Explain why 51, 11, 1, and 1 are odd integers.
It is important to realize that mathematical definitions are not made randomly. In
most cases, they are motivated by a mathematical concept that occurs frequently.
2. Are the definitions of even integers and odd integers consistent with your
previous ideas about even and odd integers?
Preview Activity 2 (Thinking about a Proof)
Consider the following proposition:
Proposition. If x and y are odd integers, then x  y is an odd integer.
Think about how you might go about proving this proposition. A direct proof of
a conditional statement is a demonstration that the conclusion of the conditional
statement follows logically from the hypothesis of the conditional statement. Definitions and previously proven propositions are used to justify each step in the proof.
To help get started in proving this proposition, answer the following questions:
1. The proposition is a conditional statement. What is the hypothesis of this
conditional statement? What is the conclusion of this conditional statement?
2. If x D 2 and y D 3, then x  y D 6. Does this example prove that the
proposition is false? Explain.
3. If x D 5 and y D 3, then x  y D 15. Does this example prove that the
proposition is true? Explain.
In order to prove this proposition, we need to prove that whenever both x and y are
odd integers, x  y is an odd integer. Since we cannot explore all possible pairs of
integer values for x and y, we will use the definition of an odd integer to help us
construct a proof.

1.2. Constructing Direct Proofs

17

4. To start a proof of this proposition, we will assume that the hypothesis of the
conditional statement is true. So in this case, we assume that both x and y
are odd integers. We can then use the definition of an odd integer to conclude
that there exists an integer m such that x D 2m C 1. Now use the definition
of an odd integer to make a conclusion about the integer y.
Note: The definition of an odd integer says that a certain other integer exists.
This definition may be applied to both x and y. However, do not use the
same letter in both cases. To do so would imply that x D y and we have not
made that assumption. To be more specific, if x D 2m C 1 and y D 2m C 1,
then x D y.
5. We need to prove that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion is true.
So, in this case, we need to prove that x  y is an odd integer. At this point,
we usually ask ourselves a so-called backward question. In this case, we
ask, ‚ÄúUnder what conditions can we conclude that x  y is an odd integer?‚Äù
Use the definition of an odd integer to answer this question, and be careful
to use a different letter for the new integer than was used in Part (4).

Properties of Number Systems
At the end of Section 1.1, we introduced notations for the standard number systems
we use in mathematics. We also discussed some closure properties of the standard
number systems. For this text, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with these
closure properties and the basic rules of algebra that apply to all real numbers. That
is, it is assumed the reader is familiar with the properties of the real numbers shown
in Table 1.2.

Constructing a Proof of a Conditional Statement
In order to prove that a conditional statement P ! Q is true, we only need to
prove that Q is true whenever P is true. This is because the conditional statement
is true whenever the hypothesis is false. So in a direct proof of P ! Q, we assume
that P is true, and using this assumption, we proceed through a logical sequence
of steps to arrive at the conclusion that Q is true.
Unfortunately, it is often not easy to discover how to start this logical sequence
of steps or how to get to the conclusion that Q is true. We will describe a method
of exploration that often can help in discovering the steps of a proof. This method

will involve working forward from the hypothesis, P , and backward from the conclusion, Q. We will use a device called the ‚Äúknow-show table‚Äù to help organize
our thoughts and the steps of the proof. This will be illustrated with the proposition
from Preview Activity 2.
Proposition. If x and y are odd integers, then x  y is an odd integer.
The first step is to identify the hypothesis, P , and the conclusion,Q, of the conditional statement. In this case, we have the following:
P : x and y are odd integers.

Q: x  y is an odd integer.

We now treat P as what we know (we have assumed it to be true) and treat Q as
what we want to show (that is, the goal). So we organize this by using P as the first
step in the know portion of the table and Q as the last step in the show portion of
the table. We will put the know portion of the table at the top and the show portion
of the table at the bottom.

We have not yet filled in the reason for the last step because we do not yet know
how we will reach the goal. The idea now is to ask ourselves questions about what
we know and what we are trying to prove. We usually start with the conclusion
that we are trying to prove by asking a so-called backward question. The basic
form of the question is, ‚ÄúUnder what conditions can we conclude that Q is true?‚Äù
How we ask the question is crucial since we must be able to answer it. We should
first try to ask and answer the question in an abstract manner and then apply it to
the particular form of statement Q.
In this case, we are trying to prove that some integer is an odd integer. So our
backward question could be, ‚ÄúHow do we prove that an integer is odd?‚Äù At this
time, the only way we have of answering this question is to use the definition of an
odd integer. So our answer could be, ‚ÄúWe need to prove that there exists an integer
q such that the integer equals 2q C 1.‚Äù We apply this answer to statement Q and
insert it as the next to last line in the know-show table.

Definition of an odd integer
Reason

We now focus our effort on proving statement Q1 since we know that if we can
prove Q1, then we can conclude that Q is true. We ask a backward question
about Q1 such as, ‚ÄúHow can we prove that there exists an integer q such that
x  y D 2q C 1?‚Äù We may not have a ready answer for this question, and so we
look at the know portion of the table and try to connect the know portion to the
show portion. To do this, we work forward from step P , and this involves asking
a forward question. The basic form of this type of question is, ‚ÄúWhat can we
conclude from the fact that P is true?‚Äù In this case, we can use the definition of an
odd integer to conclude that there exist integers m and n such that x D 2m C 1 and
y D 2n C 1. We will call this Step P1 in the know-show table. It is important to
notice that we were careful not to use the letter q to denote these integers. If we had
used q again, we would be claiming that the same integer that gives x  y D 2q C 1
also gives x D 2q C 1. This is why we used m and n for the integers x and y since
there is no guarantee that x equals y. The basic rule of thumb is to use a different
symbol for each new object we introduce in a proof. So at this point, we have:

20

Chapter 1. Introduction to Writing Proofs in Mathematics
 Step P1. We know that there exist integers m and n such that x D 2m C 1
and y D 2n C 1.

 Step Q1. We need to prove that there exists an integer q such that
x  y D 2q C 1.

We must always be looking for a way to link the ‚Äúknow part‚Äù to the ‚Äúshow part‚Äù.
There are conclusions we can make from P1, but as we proceed, we must always
keep in mind the form of statement in Q1. The next forward question is, ‚ÄúWhat
can we conclude about x  y from what we know?‚Äù One way to answer this is
to use our prior knowledge of algebra. That is, we can first use substitution to
write x  y D .2m C 1/ .2n C 1/. Although this equation does not prove that
x  y is odd, we can use algebra to try to rewrite the right side of this equation
.2m C 1/ .2n C 1/ in the form of an odd integer so that we can arrive at step Q1.
We first expand the right side of the equation to obtain

x  y D .2m C 1/.2n C 1/

D 4mn C 2m C 2n C 1

Now compare the right side of the last equation to the right side of the equation in
step Q1. Sometimes the difficult part at this point is the realization that q stands
for some integer and that we only have to show that x  y equals two times some
integer plus one. Can we now make that conclusion? The answer is yes because
we can factor a 2 from the first three terms on the right side of the equation and
obtain

x  y D 4mn C 2m C 2n C 1

D 2.2mn C m C n/ C 1

We can now complete the table showing the outline of the proof as follows:

It is very important to realize that we have only constructed an outline of a
proof. Mathematical proofs are not written in table form. They are written in
narrative form using complete sentences and correct paragraph structure, and they
follow certain conventions used in writing mathematics. In addition, most proofs
are written only from the forward perspective. That is, although the use of the
backward process was essential in discovering the proof, when we write the proof
in narrative form, we use the forward process described in the preceding table. A
completed proof follows.
Theorem 1.8. If x and y are odd integers, then x  y is an odd integer.
Proof. We assume that x and y are odd integers and will prove that x  y is an odd
integer. Since x and y are odd, there exist integers m and n such that
x D 2m C 1 and y D 2n C 1:
Using algebra, we obtain
x  y D .2m C 1/ .2n C 1/
D 4mn C 2m C 2n C 1

D 2 .2mn C m C n/ C 1:

Since m and n are integers and the integers are closed under addition and multiplication, we conclude that .2mn C m C n/ is an integer. This means that x  y has

22

Chapter 1. Introduction to Writing Proofs in Mathematics

been written in the form .2q C 1/ for some integer q, and hence, x  y is an odd
integer. Consequently, it has been proven that if x and y are odd integers, then x  y
is an odd integer.

Writing Guidelines for Mathematics Proofs
At the risk of oversimplification, doing mathematics can be considered to have two
distinct stages. The first stage is to convince yourself that you have solved the
problem or proved a conjecture. This stage is a creative one and is quite often how
mathematics is actually done. The second equally important stage is to convince
other people that you have solved the problem or proved the conjecture. This
second stage often has little in common with the first stage in the sense that it does
not really communicate the process by which you solved the problem or proved
the conjecture. However, it is an important part of the process of communicating
mathematical results to a wider audience.
A mathematical proof is a convincing argument (within the accepted standards of the mathematical community) that a certain mathematical statement is
necessarily true. A proof generally uses deductive reasoning and logic but also
contains some amount of ordinary language (such as English). A mathematical
proof that you write should convince an appropriate audience that the result you
are proving is in fact true. So we do not consider a proof complete until there is
a well-written proof. So it is important to introduce some writing guidelines. The
preceding proof was written according to the following basic guidelines for writing
proofs. More writing guidelines will be given in Chapter 3.
1. Begin with a carefully worded statement of the theorem or result to be
proven. This should be a simple declarative statement of the theorem or
result. Do not simply rewrite the problem as stated in the textbook or given
on a handout. Problems often begin with phrases such as ‚ÄúShow that‚Äù or
‚ÄúProve that.‚Äù This should be reworded as a simple declarative statement of
the theorem. Then skip a line and write ‚ÄúProof‚Äù in italics or boldface font
(when using a word processor). Begin the proof on the same line. Make
sure that all paragraphs can be easily identified. Skipping a line between
paragraphs or indenting each paragraph can accomplish this.
As an example, an exercise in a text might read, ‚ÄúProve that if x is an odd
integer, then x 2 is an odd integer.‚Äù This could be started as follows:
Theorem. If x is an odd integer, then x 2 is an odd integer.

1.2. Constructing Direct Proofs

23

Proof : We assume that x is an odd integer : : :
2. Begin the proof with a statement of your assumptions. Follow the statement of your assumptions with a statement of what you will prove.
Theorem. If x is an odd integer, then x 2 is an odd integer.
Proof. We assume that x is an odd integer and will prove that x 2 is an odd
integer.
3. Use the pronoun ‚Äúwe.‚Äù If a pronoun is used in a proof, the usual convention
is to use ‚Äúwe‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI.‚Äù The idea is to stress that you and the reader
are doing the mathematics together. It will help encourage the reader to
continue working through the mathematics. Notice that we started the proof
of Theorem 1.8 with ‚ÄúWe assume that : : : .‚Äù
4. Use italics for variables when using a word processor. When using a
word processor to write mathematics, the word processor needs to be capable of producing the appropriate mathematical symbols and equations. The
mathematics that is written with a word processor should look like typeset
mathematics. This means that italics font is used for variables, boldface font
is used for vectors, and regular font is used for mathematical terms such as
the names of the trigonometric and logarithmic functions.
For example, we do not write sin (x) or sin (x). The proper way to typeset
this is sin.x/.
5. Display important equations and mathematical expressions. Equations
and manipulations are often an integral part of mathematical exposition. Do
not write equations, algebraic manipulations, or formulas in one column with
reasons given in another column. Important equations and manipulations
should be displayed. This means that they should be centered with blank
lines before and after the equation or manipulations, and if the left side of
the equations do not change, it should not be repeated. For example,
Using algebra, we obtain
x  y D .2m C 1/ .2n C 1/

D 4mn C 2m C 2n C 1

D 2 .2mn C m C n/ C 1:

Since m and n are integers, we conclude that : : : .
6. Tell the reader when the proof has been completed. Perhaps the best
way to do this is to simply write, ‚ÄúThis completes the proof.‚Äù Although it

24

Chapter 1. Introduction to Writing Proofs in Mathematics
may seem repetitive, a good alternative is to finish a proof with a sentence
that states precisely what has been proven. In any case, it is usually good
practice to use some ‚Äúend of proof symbol‚Äù such as .

Progress Check 1.9 (Proving Propositions)
Construct a know-show table for each of the following propositions and then write
a formal proof for one of the propositions.
1. If x is an even integer and y is an even integer, then x C y is an even integer.
2. If x is an even integer and y is an odd integer, then x C y is an odd integer.
3. If x is an odd integer and y is an odd integer, then x C y is an even integer.

Some Comments about Constructing Direct Proofs
1. When we constructed the know-show table prior to writing a proof for Theorem 1.8, we had only one answer for the backward question and one answer
for the forward question. Often, there can be more than one answer for these
questions. For example, consider the following statement:
If x is an odd integer, then x 2 is an odd integer.
The backward question for this could be, ‚ÄúHow do I prove that an integer is
an odd integer?‚Äù One way to answer this is to use the definition of an odd
integer, but another way is to use the result of Theorem 1.8. That is, we can
prove an integer is odd by proving that it is a product of two odd integers.
The difficulty then is deciding which answer to use. Sometimes we can
tell by carefully watching the interplay between the forward process and the
backward process. Other times, we may have to work with more than one
possible answer.
2. Sometimes we can use previously proven results to answer a forward question or a backward question. This was the case in the example given in
Comment (1), where Theorem 1.8 was used to answer a backward question.
3. Although we start with two separate processes (forward and backward), the
key to constructing a proof is to find a way to link these two processes. This
can be difficult. One way to proceed is to use the know portion of the table
to motivate answers to backward questions and to use the show portion of
the table to motivate answers to forward questions.

1.2. Constructing Direct Proofs

25

4. Answering a backward question can sometimes be tricky. If the goal is the
statement Q, we must construct the know-show table so that if we know that
Q1 is true, then we can conclude that Q is true. It is sometimes easy to
answer this in a way that if it is known that Q is true, then we can conclude
that Q1 is true. For example, suppose the goal is to prove
y 2 D 4;
where y is a real number. A backward question could be, ‚ÄúHow do we
prove the square of a real number equals four?‚Äù One possible answer is to
prove that the real number equals 2. Another way is to prove that the real
number equals 2. This is an appropriate backward question, and these are
appropriate answers.
However, if the goal is to prove
y D 2;
where y is a real number, we could ask, ‚ÄúHow do we prove a real number
equals 2?‚Äù It is not appropriate to answer this question with ‚Äúprove that the
square of the real number equals 4.‚Äù This is because if y 2 D 4, then it is not
necessarily true that y D 2.
5. Finally, it is very important to realize that not every proof can be constructed
by the use of a simple know-show table. Proofs will get more complicated
than the ones that are in this section. The main point of this section is not
the know-show table itself, but the way of thinking about a proof that is indicated by a know-show table. In most proofs, it is very important to specify
carefully what it is that is being assumed and what it is that we are trying
to prove. The process of asking the ‚Äúbackward questions‚Äù and the ‚Äúforward
questions‚Äù is the important part of the know-show table. It is very important to get into the ‚Äúhabit of mind‚Äù of working backward from what it is we
are trying to prove and working forward from what it is we are assuming.
Instead of immediately trying to write a complete proof, we need to stop,
think, and ask questions such as
 Just exactly what is it that I am trying to prove?
 How can I prove this?

 What methods do I have that may allow me to prove this?
 What are the assumptions?

 How can I use these assumptions to prove the result?

The Pythagorean Theorem for right triangles states that if a and b are the lengths
of the legs of a right triangle and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then a2 C b 2 D
c 2 . For example, if a D 5 and b D 12 are the lengths of the two sides of a right
triangle and if c is the length of the hypotenuse, then the c 2 D 52 C 122 and so
c 2 D 169. Since c is a length and must be positive, we conclude that c D 13.
Construct and provide a well-written proof for the following proposition.
Proposition. If m is a real number and m, m C 1, and m C 2 are the lengths of the
three sides of a right triangle, then m D 3.
Although this proposition uses different mathematical concepts than the one used
in this section, the process of constructing a proof for this proposition is the same
forward-backward method that was used to construct a proof for Theorem 1.8.
However, the backward question, ‚ÄúHow do we prove that m D 3?‚Äù is simple
but may be difficult to answer. The basic idea is to develop an equation from the
forward process and show that m D 3 is a solution of that equation.

Explorations and Activities
13. Pythagorean Triples. Three natural numbers a, b, and c with a < b < c
are said to form a Pythagorean triple provided that a2 C b 2 D c 2 . For
example, 3, 4, and 5 form a Pythagorean triple since 32 C 42 D 52 . The
study of Pythagorean triples began with the development of the Pythagorean
Theorem for right triangles, which states that if a and b are the lengths
of the legs of a right triangle and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then
a2 C b 2 D c 2 . For example, if the lengths of the legs of a right triangle are
4 and 7 p
units, then c 2 D 42 C 72 D 63, and the length of the hypotenuse
must be 63 units
p (since the length must be a positive real

number.

Statements and Logical Operators

Preview Activity 1 (Compound Statements)
Mathematicians often develop ways to construct new mathematical objects from
existing mathematical objects. It is possible to form new statements from existing
statements by connecting the statements with words such as ‚Äúand‚Äù and ‚Äúor‚Äù or by
negating the statement. A logical operator (or connective) on mathematical statements is a word or combination of words that combines one or more mathematical
statements to make a new mathematical statement. A compound statement is a
statement that contains one or more operators. Because some operators are used so
frequently in logic and mathematics, we give them names and use special symbols
to represent them.
 The conjunction of the statements P and Q is the statement ‚ÄúP and Q‚Äù
and its denoted by P ^ Q . The statement P ^ Q is true only when both P
and Q are true.
 The disjunction of the statements P and Q is the statement ‚ÄúP or Q‚Äù and
its denoted by P _ Q . The statement P _ Q is true only when at least one
of P or Q is true.
 The negation (of a statement) of the statement P is the statement ‚Äúnot P ‚Äù
and is denoted by :P . The negation of P is true only when P is false, and
:P is false only when P is true.
 The implicaton or conditional is the statement ‚ÄúIf P then Q‚Äù and is denoted by P ! Q . The statement P ! Q is often read as ‚ÄúP implies Q,
33

34

Chapter 2. Logical Reasoning
and we have seen in Section 1.1 that P ! Q is false only when P is true
and Q is false.

Some comments about the disjunction.
It is important to understand the use of the operator ‚Äúor.‚Äù In mathematics, we use
the ‚Äúinclusive or‚Äù unless stated otherwise. This means that P _ Q is true when
both P and Q are true and also when only one of them is true. That is, P _ Q is
true when at least one of P or Q is true, or P _ Q is false only when both P and
Q are false.
A different use of the word ‚Äúor‚Äù is the ‚Äúexclusive or.‚Äù For the exclusive or, the
resulting statement is false when both statements are true. That is, ‚ÄúP exclusive or
Q‚Äù is true only when exactly one of P or Q is true. In everyday life, we often use
the exclusive or. When someone says, ‚ÄúAt the intersection, turn left or go straight,‚Äù
this person is using the exclusive or.
Some comments about the negation. Although the statement, :P , can be read
as ‚ÄúIt is not the case that P ,‚Äù there are often betters ways to say or write this in
English. For example, we would usually say (or write):
 The negation of the statement, ‚Äú391 is prime‚Äù is ‚Äú391 is not prime.‚Äù
 The negation of the statement, ‚Äú12 < 9‚Äù is ‚Äú12  9.‚Äù
1. For the statements
P : 15 is odd

Q: 15 is prime

write each of the following statements as English sentences and determine
whether they are true or false.
(a) P ^ Q.

(b) P _ Q.

(c) P ^ :Q.

(d) :P _ :Q.

2. For the statements
P : 15 is odd

R: 15 < 17

write each of the following statements in symbolic form using the operators
^, _, and :.

2.1. Statements and Logical Operators

(c) 15 is even or 15 < 17.

(b) 15 is odd or 15  17.

(d) 15 is odd and 15  17.

Preview Activity 2 (Truth Values of Statements)
We will use the following two statements for all of this Preview Activity:
 P is the statement ‚ÄúIt is raining.‚Äù
 Q is the statement ‚ÄúDaisy is playing golf.‚Äù
In each of the following four parts, a truth value will be assigned to statements P
and Q. For example, in Question (1), we will assume that each statement is true. In
Question (2), we will assume that P is true and Q is false. In each part, determine
the truth value of each of the following statements:
(a) (P ^ Q)

It is raining and Daisy is playing golf.

(b) (P _ Q)

It is raining or Daisy is playing golf.

(c) (P ! Q)

If it is raining, then Daisy is playing golf.

(d) (:P )

It is not raining.

Which of the four statements [(a) through (d)] are true and which are false in each
of the following four situations?
1. When P is true (it is raining) and Q is true (Daisy is playing golf).
2. When P is true (it is raining) and Q is false (Daisy is not playing golf).
3. When P is false (it is not raining) and Q is true (Daisy is playing golf).
4. When P is false (it is not raining) and Q is false (Daisy is not playing golf).

In the preview activities for this section, we learned about compound statements and their truth values. This information can be summarized with truth tables
as is shown below.

Other Forms of Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are extremely important in mathematics because almost all
mathematical theorems are (or can be) stated in the form of a conditional statement
in the following form:
If ‚Äúcertain conditions are met,‚Äù then ‚Äúsomething happens.‚Äù
It is imperative that all students studying mathematics thoroughly understand the
meaning of a conditional statement and the truth table for a conditional statement.

2.1. Statements and Logical Operators

37

We also need to be aware that in the English language, there are other ways for
expressing the conditional statement P ! Q other than ‚ÄúIf P , then Q.‚Äù Following
are some common ways to express the conditional statement P ! Q in the English
language:
 If P , then Q.

 Q if P .

 P implies Q.

 Whenever P is true, Q is true.

 P only if Q.

 Q is true whenever P is true.

 Q is necessary for P . (This means that if P is true, then Q is necessarily
true.)
 P is sufficient for Q. (This means that if you want Q to be true, it is sufficient to show that P is true.)
In all of these cases, P is the hypothesis of the conditional statement and Q is
the conclusion of the conditional statement.
Progress Check 2.1 (The ‚ÄúOnly If‚Äù Statement)
Recall that a quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon. Let S represent the following
true conditional statement:
If a quadrilateral is a square, then it is a rectangle.
Write this conditional statement in English using
1. the word ‚Äúwhenever‚Äù

3. the phrase ‚Äúis necessary for‚Äù

2. the phrase ‚Äúonly if‚Äù

4. the phrase ‚Äúis sufficient for‚Äù

Constructing Truth Tables
Truth tables for compound statements can be constructed by using the truth tables
for the basic connectives. To illustrate this, we will construct a truth table for
.P ^ :Q/ ! R. The first step is to determine the number of rows needed.
 For a truth table with two different simple statements, four rows are needed
since there are four different combinations of truth values for the two statements. We should be consistent with how we set up the rows. The way we

38

Chapter 2. Logical Reasoning
will do it in this text is to label the rows for the first statement with (T, T, F,
F) and the rows for the second statement with (T, F, T, F). All truth tables in
the text have this scheme.
 For a truth table with three different simple statements, eight rows are needed
since there are eight different combinations of truth values for the three statements. Our standard scheme for this type of truth table is shown in Table 2.2.

The next step is to determine the columns to be used. One way to do this is to
work backward from the form of the given statement. For .P ^ :Q/ ! R, the
last step is to deal with the conditional operator .!/. To do this, we need to know
the truth values of .P ^ :Q/ and R. To determine the truth values for .P ^ :Q/,
we need to apply the rules for the conjunction operator .^/ and we need to know
the truth values for P and :Q.
Table 2.2 is a completed truth table for .P ^ :Q/ ! R with the step numbers
indicated at the bottom of each column. The step numbers correspond to the order
in which the columns were completed.

 When completing the column for P ^ :Q, remember that the only time the
conjunction is true is when both P and :Q are true.
 When completing the column for .P ^ :Q/ ! R, remember that the only
time the conditional statement is false is when the hypothesis .P ^ :Q/ is
true and the conclusion, R, is false.
The last column entered is the truth table for the statement .P ^ :Q/ ! R using
the set up in the first three columns.

Progress Check 2.2 (Constructing Truth Tables)
Construct a truth table for each of the following statements:
1. P ^ :Q

3. :P ^ :Q

2. : .P ^ Q/

4. :P _ :Q

Do any of these statements have the same truth table?

The Biconditional Statement
Some mathematical results are stated in the form ‚ÄúP if and only if Q‚Äù or ‚ÄúP is
necessary and sufficient for Q.‚Äù An example would be, ‚ÄúA triangle is equilateral
if and only if its three interior angles are congruent.‚Äù The symbolic form for the
biconditional statement ‚ÄúP if and only if Q‚Äù is P $ Q. In order to determine
a truth table for a biconditional statement, it is instructive to look carefully at the
form of the phrase ‚ÄúP if and only if Q.‚Äù The word ‚Äúand‚Äù suggests that this statement is a conjunction. Actually it is a conjunction of the statements ‚ÄúP if Q‚Äù and
‚ÄúP only if Q.‚Äù The symbolic form of this conjunction is ≈í.Q ! P / ^ .P ! Q/¬ç.
Progress Check 2.3 (The Truth Table for the Biconditional Statement)
Complete a truth table for ≈í.Q ! P / ^ .P ! Q/¬ç. Use the following columns:
P , Q, Q ! P , P ! Q, and ≈í.Q ! P / ^ .P ! Q/¬ç. The last column of this
table will be the truth table for P $ Q.

Other Forms of the Biconditional Statement
As with the conditional statement, there are some common ways to express the
biconditional statement, P $ Q, in the English language. For example,
 P if and only if Q.
 P implies Q and Q implies P .

 P is necessary and sufficient for
Q.

Tautologies and Contradictions
Definition. A tautology is a compound statement S that is true for all possible combinations of truth values of the component statements that are part
of S . A contradiction is a compound statement that is false for all possible
combinations of truth values of the component statements that are part of S .
That is, a tautology is necessarily true in all circumstances, and a contradiction
is necessarily false in all circumstances.

2. Use a truth table to show that .P ^ :P / is a contradiction.
3. Use a truth table to determine if P ! .P _Q/ is a tautology, a contradiction,
or neither.

Logically Equivalent Statements

Preview Activity 1 (Logically Equivalent Statements)
In Exercises (5) and (6) from Section 2.1, we observed situations where two different statements have the same truth tables. Basically, this means these statements
are equivalent, and we make the following definition:
Definition. Two expressions are logically equivalent provided that they have
the same truth value for all possible combinations of truth values for all variables appearing in the two expressions. In this case, we write X  Y and say
that X and Y are logically equivalent.
1. Complete truth tables for : .P ^ Q/ and :P _ :Q.
2. Are the expressions : .P ^ Q/ and :P _ :Q logically equivalent?
3. Suppose that the statement ‚ÄúI will play golf and I will mow the lawn‚Äù is false.
Then its negation is true. Write the negation of this statement in the form of
a disjunction. Does this make sense?
Sometimes we actually use logical reasoning in our everyday living! Perhaps
you can imagine a parent making the following two statements.

44

Statement 2

If you do not clean your room, then you cannot
watch TV.
You clean your room or you cannot watch TV.

4. Let P be ‚Äúyou do not clean your room,‚Äù and let Q be ‚Äúyou cannot watch TV.‚Äù
Use these to translate Statement 1 and Statement 2 into symbolic forms.
5. Construct a truth table for each of the expressions you determined in Part (4).
Are the expressions logically equivalent?

statement in symbolic form that is a conjunction and involves P and Q.
7. Write a truth table for the (conjunction) statement in Part (6) and compare it
to a truth table for : .P ! Q/. What do you observe?
Preview Activity 2 (Converse and Contrapositive)
We now define two important conditional statements that are associated with a
given conditional statement.
Definition. If P and Q are statements, then
 The converse of the conditional statement P ! Q is the conditional
statement Q ! P .
 The contrapositive of the conditional statement P ! Q is the conditional statement :Q ! :P .
1. For the following, the variable x represents a real number. Label each of the
following statements as true or false.
(a) If x D 3, then x 2 D 9.

(b) If x 2 D 9, then x D 3.

(c) If x 2 ¬§ 9, then x ¬§ 3.

(d) If x ¬§ 3, then x 2 ¬§ 9.

2. Which statement in the list of conditional statements in Part (1) is the converse of Statement (1a)? Which is the contrapositive of Statement (1a)?
3. Complete appropriate truth tables to show that
 P ! Q is logically equivalent to its contrapositive :Q ! :P .

2.2. Logically Equivalent Statements

45

 P ! Q is not logically equivalent to its converse Q ! P .
In Preview Activity 1, we introduced the concept of logically equivalent expressions and the notation X  Y to indicate that statements X and Y are logically equivalent. The following theorem gives two important logical equivalencies.
They are sometimes referred to as De Morgan‚Äôs Laws.
Theorem 2.5 (De Morgan‚Äôs Laws)
For statements P and Q,
 The statement : .P ^ Q/ is logically equivalent to :P _ :Q. This can be
written as : .P ^ Q/  :P _ :Q.
 The statement : .P _ Q/ is logically equivalent to :P ^ :Q. This can be
written as : .P _ Q/  :P ^ :Q.
The first equivalency in Theorem 2.5 was established in Preview Activity 1.

Table 2.3: Truth Table for One of De Morgan‚Äôs Laws
It is possible to develop and state several different logical equivalencies at this
time. However, we will restrict ourselves to what are considered to be some of the
most important ones. Since many mathematical statements are written in the form
of conditional statements, logical equivalencies related to conditional statements
are quite important.

Logical Equivalencies Related to Conditional Statements
The first two logical equivalencies in the following theorem were established in
Preview Activity 1, and the third logical equivalency was established in Preview
Activity 2.

46

Chapter 2. Logical Reasoning

Theorem 2.6. For statements P and Q,
1. The conditional statement P ! Q is logically equivalent to :P _ Q.
2. The statement : .P ! Q/ is logically equivalent to P ^ :Q.
3. The conditional statement P ! Q is logically equivalent to its contrapositive :Q ! :P .

The Negation of a Conditional Statement
The logical equivalency : .P ! Q/  P ^ :Q is interesting because it shows
us that the negation of a conditional statement is not another conditional statement. The negation of a conditional statement can be written in the form of a
conjunction. So what does it mean to say that the conditional statement
If you do not clean your room, then you cannot watch TV,
is false? To answer this, we can use the logical equivalency : .P ! Q/  P ^
:Q. The idea is that if P ! Q is false, then its negation must be true. So the
negation of this can be written as
You do not clean your room and you can watch TV.
For another example, consider the following conditional statement:
If 5 <

3, then . 5/2 < . 3/2 .

This conditional statement is false since its hypothesis is true and its conclusion
is false. Consequently, its negation must be true. Its negation is not a conditional
statement. The negation can be written in the form of a conjunction by using the
logical equivalency : .P ! Q/  P ^ :Q. So, the negation can be written as
follows:


5 < 3 and : . 5/2 < . 3/2 .
However, the second part of this conjunction can be written in a simpler manner by
noting that ‚Äúnot less than‚Äù means the same thing as ‚Äúgreater than or equal to.‚Äù So
we use this to write the negation of the original conditional statement as follows:

2.2. Logically Equivalent Statements
5<

47

3 and . 5/2 > . 3/2 .

This conjunction is true since each of the individual statements in the conjunction
is true.

Another Method of Establishing Logical Equivalencies
We have seen that it often possible to use a truth table to establish a logical equivalency. However, it is also possible to prove a logical equivalency using a sequence
of previously established logical equivalencies. For example,
 P ! Q is logically equivalent to :P _ Q. So
 : .P ! Q/ is logically equivalent to : .:P _ Q/.
 Hence, by one of De Morgan‚Äôs Laws (Theorem 2.5), : .P ! Q/ is logically
equivalent to : .:P / ^ :Q.
 This means that : .P ! Q/ is logically equivalent to P ^ :Q.
The last step used the fact that : .:P / is logically equivalent to P .
When proving theorems in mathematics, it is often important to be able to
decide if two expressions are logically equivalent. Sometimes when we are attempting to prove a theorem, we may be unsuccessful in developing a proof for the
original statement of the theorem. However, in some cases, it is possible to prove
an equivalent statement. Knowing that the statements are equivalent tells us that if
we prove one, then we have also proven the other. In fact, once we know the truth
value of a statement, then we know the truth value of any other logically equivalent
statement. This is illustrated in Progress Check 2.7.
Progress Check 2.7 (Working with a Logical Equivalency)
In Section 2.1, we constructed a truth table for .P ^ :Q/ ! R. See page 38.
1. Although it is possible to use truth tables to show that P ! .Q _ R/ is
logically equivalent to .P ^ :Q/ ! R, we instead use previously proven
logical equivalencies to prove this logical equivalency. In this case, it may
be easier to start working with .P ^ :Q/ ! R. Start with
.P ^ :Q/ ! R  : .P ^ :Q/ _ R;
which is justified by the logical equivalency established in Part (5) of Preview
Activity 1. Continue by using one of De Morgan‚Äôs Laws on : .P ^ :Q/.

48

Chapter 2. Logical Reasoning
2. Let a and b be integers. Suppose we are trying to prove the following:
 If 3 is a factor of a  b, then 3 is a factor of a or 3 is a factor of b.
Explain why we will have proven this statement if we prove the following:
 If 3 is a factor of a  b and 3 is not a factor of a, then 3 is a factor of b.

As we will see, it is often difficult to construct a direct proof for a conditional statement of the form P ! .Q _ R/. The logical equivalency in Progress
Check 2.7 gives us another way to attempt to prove a statement of the form
P ! .Q _ R/. The advantage of the equivalent form, .P ^ :Q/ ! R, is that
we have an additional assumption, :Q, in the hypothesis. This gives us more
information with which to work.
Theorem 2.8 states some of the most frequently used logical equivalencies used
when writing mathematical proofs.

Explorations and Activities
13. Working with a Logical Equivalency. Suppose we are trying to prove the
following for integers x and y:
If x  y is even, then x is even or y is even.
We notice that we can write this statement in the following symbolic form:
P ! .Q _ R/ ;
where P is ‚Äúx  y is even,‚Äù Q is ‚Äúx is even,‚Äù and R is ‚Äúy is even.‚Äù
(a) Write the symbolic form of the contrapositive of P ! .Q _ R/. Then
use one of De Morgan‚Äôs Laws (Theorem 2.5) to rewrite the hypothesis
of this conditional statement.
(b) Use the result from Part (13a) to explain why the given statement is
logically equivalent to the following statement:
If x is odd and y is odd, then x  y is odd.
The two statements in this activity are logically equivalent. We now have the
choice of proving either of these statements. If we prove one, we prove the
other, or if we show one is false, the other is also false. The second statement
is Theorem 1.8, which was proven in Section 1.2.

Open Sentences and Sets

Preview Activity 1 (Sets and Set Notation)
The theory of sets is fundamental to mathematics in the sense that many areas
of mathematics use set theory and its language and notation. This language and
notation must be understood if we are to communicate effectively in mathematics.
At this point, we will give a very brief introduction to some of the terminology
used in set theory.
A set is a well-defined collection of objects that can be thought of as a single
entity itself. For example, we can think of the set of integers that are greater than
4. Even though we cannot write down all the integers that are in this set, it is still
a perfectly well-defined set. This means that if we are given a specific integer, we
can tell whether or not it is in the set of all even integers.

2.3. Open Sentences and Sets

53

The most basic way of specifying the elements of a set is to list the elements
of that set. This works well when the set contains only a small number of objects.
The usual practice is to list these elements between braces. For example, if the set
C consists of the integer solutions of the equation x 2 D 9, we would write
C D f 3; 3g :
For larger sets, it is sometimes inconvenient to list all of the elements of the
set. In this case, we often list several of them and then write a series of three dots
(: : :) to indicate that the pattern continues. For example,
D D f1; 3; 5; 7; : : : 49g
is the set of all odd natural numbers from 1 to 49, inclusive.
For some sets, it is not possible to list all of the elements of a set; we then
list several of the elements in the set and again use a series of three dots (: : :) to
indicate that the pattern continues. For example, if F is the set of all even natural
numbers, we could write
F D f2; 4; 6; : : :g :
We can also use the three dots before listing specific elements to indicate the
pattern prior to those elements. For example, if E is the set of all even integers, we
could write
E D f: : : 6; 4; 2; 0; 2; 4; 6; : : :g :
Listing the elements of a set inside braces is called the roster method of specifying
the elements of the set. We will learn other ways of specifying the elements of a
set later in this section.
1. Use the roster method to specify the elements of each of the following sets:
(a) The set of real numbers that are solutions of the equation x 2
(b) The set of natural numbers that are less than or equal to 10.

5x D 0.

(c) The set of integers that are greater than 2.
2. Each of the following sets is defined using the roster method. For each set,
determine four elements of the set other than the ones listed using the roster
method.

Preview Activity 2 (Variables)
Not all mathematical sentences are statements. For example, an equation such as
x2

5D0

is not a statement. In this sentence, the symbol x is a variable. It represents a
number that may be chosen from some specified set of numbers. The sentence
(equation) becomes true or false when a specific number is substituted for x.

Definition. A variable is a symbol representing an unspecified object that can
be chosen from a given set U . The set U is called the universal set for the
variable. It is the set of specified objects from which objects may be chosen
to substitute for the variable. A constant is a specific member of the universal
set.
Some sets that we will use frequently are the usual number systems. Recall
that we use the symbol R to stand for the set of all real numbers, the symbol Q to
stand for the set of all rational numbers, the symbol Z to stand for the set of all
integers, and the symbol N to stand for the set of all natural numbers.
A variable is a symbol representing an unspecified object that can be chosen
from some specified set of objects. This specified set of objects is agreed to in
advance and is frequently called the universal set.

Some Set Notation
In Preview Activity 1, we indicated that a set is a well-defined collection of objects
that can be thought of as an entity itself.
 If A is a set and y is one of the objects in the set A, we write y 2 A and read
this as ‚Äúy is an element of A‚Äù or ‚Äúy is a member of A.‚Äù For example, if B is
the set of all integers greater than 4, then we could write 5 2 B and 10 2 B.
 If an object z is not an element in the set A, we write z ‚Ä¶ A and read this as
‚Äúz is not an element of A.‚Äù For example, if B is the set of all integers greater
than 4, then we could write 2 ‚Ä¶ B and 4 ‚Ä¶ B.
When working with a mathematical object, such as set, we need to define when
two of these objects are equal. We are also often interested in whether or not one
set is contained in another set.
Definition. Two sets, A and B, are equal when they have precisely the same
elements. In this case, we write A D B . When the sets A and B are not
equal, we write A ¬§ B.
The set A is a subset of a set B provided that each element of A is an element
of B. In this case, we write A  B and also say that A is contained in B.
When A is not a subset of B, we write A 6 B.
Using these definitions, we see that for any set A, A D A and since it is true that
for each x 2 U , if x 2 A, then x 2 A, we also see that A  A. That is, any set is
equal to itself and any set is a subset of itself. For some specific examples, we see
that:

even though the elements may be repeated or written in a different order.

Variables and Open Sentences
As we have seen in the Preview Activities, not all mathematical sentences are statements. This is often true if the sentence contains a variable. The following terminology is useful in working with sentences and statements.
Definition. An open sentence is a sentence P .x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn/ involving variables x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn with the property that when specific values from the universal set are assigned to x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn, then the resulting sentence is either
true or false. That is, the resulting sentence is a statement. An open sentence
is also called a predicate or a propositional function.
Notation: One reason an open sentence is sometimes called a propositional function is the fact that we use function notation P .x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn/ for an open sentence

2.3. Open Sentences and Sets

57

in n variables. When there is only one variable, such as x, we write P .x/, which is
read ‚ÄúP of x.‚Äù In this notation, x represents an arbitrary element of the universal
set, and P .x/ represents a sentence. When we substitute a specific element of the
universal set for x, the resulting sentence becomes a statement. This is illustrated
in the next example.
Example 2.10 (Open Sentences)
If the universal set is R, then the sentence ‚Äúx 2
involving the one variable x.

10 D 0‚Äù is an open sentence

 If we substitute x D 2, we obtain the false statement ‚Äú22
 If we substitute x D 5, we obtain the true statement ‚Äú52

say that P .2/ is false and P .5/ is true.

 Q.1; 1/ is false since ‚Äú1 C 2  1 D 7‚Äù is false; and
 Q.3; 2/ is true since ‚Äú3 C 2  2 D 7‚Äù is true.

(b) Find two different examples for which R.x; y; z/ is true.
Without using the term, Example 2.10 and Progress Check 2.11 (and Preview
Activity 2) dealt with a concept called the truth set of a predicate.

58

Chapter 2. Logical Reasoning

Definition. The truth set of an open sentence with one variable is the
collection of objects in the universal set that can be substituted for the variable
to make the predicate a true statement.

One part of elementary mathematics consists of learning how to solve equations.
In more formal terms, the process of solving an equation is a way to determine the
truth set for the equation, which is an open sentence. In this case, we often call the
truth set the solution set. Following are three examples of truth sets.
 If the universal set is R, then the truth set of the equation 3x
set f6g.

8 D 10 is the

 If the universal set is R, then the truth set of the equation ‚Äúx 2
is f 2; 5g.

p
 If the universal set is N, then the truth set of the open sentence ‚Äú n 2 N‚Äù is
f1; 4; 9; 16; : : :g.

Set Builder Notation
Sometimes it is not possible to list all the elements of a set. For example, if the
universal set is R, we cannot list all the elements of the truth set of ‚Äúx 2 < 4.‚Äù In
this case, it is sometimes convenient to use the so-called set builder notation in
which the set is defined by stating a rule that all elements of the set must satisfy. If
P .x/ is a predicate in the variable x, then the notation
fx 2 U j P .x/g
stands for the set of all elements x in the universal set U for which P .x/ is true.
If it is clear what set is being used for the universal set, this notation is sometimes
shortened to fx j P .x/g. This is usually read as ‚Äúthe set of all x such that P .x/.‚Äù
The vertical bar stands for the phrase ‚Äúsuch that.‚Äù Some writers will use a colon (:)
instead of the vertical bar.
For a non-mathematical example, P could be the property that a college student
is a mathematics major. Then fx j P .x/g denotes the set of all college students who
are mathematics majors. This could be written as
fx j x is a college student who is a mathematics majorg :

2.3. Open Sentences and Sets

Example 2.12 (Truth Sets)
Assume the universal set is R and P .x/ is ‚Äúx 2 < 4.‚Äù We can describe the truth set
of P .x/ as the set of all real numbers whose square is less than 4. We can also use
set builder notation to write the truth set of P .x/ as
Àö
x 2 R j x2 < 4 :

However, if we solve the inequality x 2 < 4, we obtain 2 < x < 2. So we could
also write the truth set as
fx 2 R j 2 < x < 2g :
We could read this as the set of all real numbers that are greater than 2 and less
than 2. We can also write
Àö
x 2 R j x 2 < 4 D fx 2 R j 2 < x < 2g :
Progress Check 2.13 (Working with Truth Sets)
Let P .x/ be the predicate ‚Äúx 2  9.‚Äù
1. If the universal set is R, describe the truth set of P .x/ using English and
write the truth set of P .x/ using set builder notation.
2. If the universal set is Z, then what is the truth set of P .x/? Describe this set
using English and then use the roster method to specify all the elements of
this truth set.
3. Are the truth sets in Parts (1) and (2) equal? Explain.
So far, our standard form for set builder notation has been fx 2 U j P .x/g. It
is sometimes possible to modify this form and put the predicate first. For example,
the set
A D f3n C 1 j n 2 Ng
describes the set of all natural numbers of the form 3nC1 for some natural number.
By substituting 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, for n, we can use the roster method to write
A D f3n C 1 j n 2 Ng D f4; 7; 10; 13; : : :g :
We can sometimes ‚Äúreverse this process‚Äù by starting with a set specified by the
roster method and then writing the same set using set builder notation.

60

Chapter 2. Logical Reasoning

Example 2.14 (Set Builder Notation)
Let B D f: : : 11; 7; 3; 1; 5; 9; 13; : : :g. The key to writing this set using set
builder notation is to recognize the pattern involved. We see that once we have an
integer in B, we can obtain another integer in B by adding 4. This suggests that
the predicate we will use will involve multiplying by 4.
Since it is usually easier to work with positive numbers, we notice that 1 2 B
and 5 2 B. Notice that
1 D40C1

and

5 D 4  1 C 1.

This suggests that we might try f4n C 1 j n 2 Zg. In fact, by trying other integers for n, we can see that

The Empty Set
When a set contains no elements, we say that the set is the empty set. For example,
the set of all rational numbers that are solutions of the equation x 2 D 2 is the
empty set since this equation has no solutions that are rational numbers.
In mathematics, the empty set is usually designated by the symbol ;. We usually read the symbol ; as ‚Äúthe empty set‚Äù or ‚Äúthe null set.‚Äù (The symbol ; is
actually the last letter in the Danish-Norwegian alphabet.)

2.3. Open Sentences and Sets

When the Truth Set Is the Universal Set
The truth set of a predicate can be the universal set. For example, if the universal
set is the set of real numbers R, then the truth set of the predicate ‚Äúx C 0 D x‚Äù is
R.
Notice that the sentence ‚Äúx C 0 D x‚Äù has not been quantified and a particular
element of the universal set has not been substituted for the variable x. Even though
the truth set for this sentence is the universal set, we will adopt the convention
that unless the quantifier is stated explicitly, we will consider the sentence to be a
predicate or open sentence. So, with this convention, if the universal set is R, then
 x C 0 D x is a predicate;
 For each real number x, .x C 0 D x/ is a statement.

7. Closure Explorations. In Section 1.1, we studied some of the closure properties of the standard number systems. (See page 10.) We can extend this
idea to other sets of numbers. So we say that:
 A set A of numbers is closed under addition provided that whenever
x and y are in the set A, x C y is in the set A.

Quantifiers and Negations

Preview Activity 1 (An Introduction to Quantifiers)
We have seen that one way to create a statement from an open sentence is to substitute a specific element from the universal set for each variable in the open sentence.
Another way is to make some claim about the truth set of the open sentence. This
is often done by using a quantifier. For example, if the universal set is R, then the
following sentence is a statement.
For each real number x, x 2 > 0.
The phrase ‚ÄúFor each real number x‚Äù is said to quantify the variable that follows it
in the sense that the sentence is claiming that something is true for all real numbers.
So this sentence is a statement (which happens to be false).
Definition. The phrase ‚Äúfor every‚Äù (or its equivalents) is called a universal
quantifier. The phrase ‚Äúthere exists‚Äù (or its equivalents) is called an existential quantifier. The symbol 8 is used to denote a universal quantifier, and the
symbol 9 is used to denote an existential quantifier.
Using this notation, the statement ‚ÄúFor eachreal number x, x 2 > 0‚Äù could be
written in symbolic form as: .8x 2 R/ x 2 > 0 . The following is an example of
a statement involving an existential quantifier.

64

Chapter 2. Logical Reasoning
There exists an integer x such that 3x

2 D 0.

This could be written in symbolic form as
.9x 2 Z/ .3x

2 D 0/ :

This statement is false because there are no integers that are solutions of the linear
equation 3x 2 D 0. Table 2.4 summarizes the facts about the two types of
quantifiers.

A statement
involving
A universal
quantifier:
.8x; P .x//
An existential
quantifier:
.9x; P .x//

Often has the form
‚ÄúFor every x, P .x/,‚Äù
where P .x/ is a
predicate.
‚ÄúThere exists an x such
that P .x/,‚Äù where P .x/
is a predicate.

The statement is true
provided that
Every value of x in
the universal set makes
P .x/ true.
There is at least one
value of x in the
universal set that makes
P .x/ true.

Table 2.4: Properties of Quantifiers
In effect, the table indicates that the universally quantified statement is true provided that the truth set of the predicate equals the universal set, and the existentially
quantified statement is true provided that the truth set of the predicate contains at
least one element.
Each of the following sentences is a statement or an open sentence. Assume that
the universal set for each variable in these sentences is the set of all real numbers.
If a sentence is an open sentence (predicate), determine its truth set. If a sentence
is a statement, determine whether it is true or false.

Forms of Quantified Statements in English
There are many ways to write statements involving quantifiers in English. In some
cases, the quantifiers are not apparent, and this often happens with conditional

66

Chapter 2. Logical Reasoning

statements. The following examples illustrate these points. Each example contains
a quantified statement written in symbolic form followed by several ways to write
the statement in English.

1. .8x 2 R/ x 2 > 0 .

 For each real number x, x 2 > 0.

 The square of every real number is greater than 0.
 The square of a real number is greater than 0.
 If x 2 R, then x 2 > 0.

In the second to the last example, the quantifier is not stated explicitly. Care
must be taken when reading this because it really does say the same thing as
the previous examples. The last example illustrates the fact that conditional
statements often contain a ‚Äúhidden‚Äù universal quantifier.
If the universal set is R, then the truth set of the open sentence x 2 > 0 is the
set of all nonzero real numbers. That is, the truth set is
fx 2 R j x ¬§ 0g :
So the preceding statements are false. For the conditional statement, the
example using x D 0 produces a true hypothesis and a false conclusion.
This is a counterexample that shows that the statement with a universal
quantifier is false.

2. .9x 2 R/ x 2 D 5 .

 There exists a real number x such that x 2 D 5.
 x 2 D 5 for some real number x.

 There is a real number whose square equals 5.
The second example is usually not used since it is not considered good writing practice to start a sentence with a mathematical symbol.
If
universal set is R, then the truth set of the predicate ‚Äúx 2 D 5‚Äù is
n the
p p o
5; 5 . So these are all true statements.

Negations of Quantified Statements
In Preview Activity 1, we wrote negations of some quantified statements. This
is a very important mathematical activity. As we will see in future sections, it
is sometimes just as important to be able to describe when some object does not
satisfy a certain property as it is to describe when the object satisfies the property.
Our next task is to learn how to write negations of quantified statements in a useful
English form.
We first look at the negation of a statement involving a universal quantifier. The
general form for such a statement can be written as .8x 2 U / .P .x//, where P .x/
is an open sentence and U is the universal set for the variable x. When we write
: .8x 2 U / ≈íP .x/¬ç ;
we are asserting that the statement .8x 2 U / ≈íP .x/¬ç is false. This is equivalent to
saying that the truth set of the open sentence P .x/ is not the universal set. That is,
there exists an element x in the universal set U such that P .x/ is false. This in turn
means that there exists an element x in U such that :P .x/ is true, which is equivalent to saying that .9x 2 U / ≈í:P .x/¬ç is true. This explains why the following
result is true:
: .8x 2 U / ≈íP .x/¬ç  .9x 2 U / ≈í:P .x/¬ç :
Similarly, when we write
: .9x 2 U / ≈íP .x/¬ç ;
we are asserting that the statement .9x 2 U / ≈íP .x/¬ç is false. This is equivalent to
saying that the truth set of the open sentence P .x/ is the empty set. That is, there
is no element x in the universal set U such that P .x/ is true. This in turn means
that for each element x in U , :P .x/ is true, and this is equivalent to saying that
.8x 2 U / ≈í:P .x/¬ç is true. This explains why the following result is true:
: .9x 2 U / ≈íP .x/¬ç  .8x 2 U / ≈í:P .x/¬ç :
We summarize these results in the following theorem.
Theorem 2.16. For any open sentence P .x/,
: .8x 2 U / ≈íP .x/¬ç  .9x 2 U / ≈í:P .x/¬ç , and
: .9x 2 U / ≈íP .x/¬ç  .8x 2 U / ≈í:P .x/¬ç :

68

Chapter 2. Logical Reasoning

Example 2.17 (Negations of Quantified Statements) 
Consider the following statement: .8x 2 R/ x 3  x 2 .

We can write this statement as an English sentence in several ways. Following
are two different ways to do so.
 For each real number x, x 3  x 2 .
 If x is a real number, then x 3 is greater than or equal to x 2 .
The second statement shows that in a conditional statement, there is often a hidden
universal quantifier. This statement is false since there are real numbers x for which
x 3 is not greater than or equal to x 2 . For example, we could use x D 1 or x D 21 .
This means that the negation must be true. We can form the negation as follows:


: .8x 2 R/ x 3  x 2  .9x 2 R/ : x 3  x 2 :

In most cases, we want to write this negation in a way that does not use the nega
tion symbol.
In this case, we can now write the open sentence : x 3  x 2 as

x 3 < x 2 . (That is, the negation of ‚Äúis greater than or equal to‚Äù is ‚Äúis less than.‚Äù)
So we obtain the following:


: .8x 2 R/ x 3  x 2  .9x 2 R/ x 3 < x 2 :


The statement .9x 2 R/ x 3 < x 2 could be written in English as follows:
 There exists a real number x such that x 3 < x 2 .

 There exists an x such that x is a real number and x 3 < x 2 .

Counterexamples and Negations of Conditional Statements
The real number x D 1 in the previous example was used to show that the statement .8x 2 R/ x 3  x 2 is false. This is called a counterexample to the statement. In general, a counterexample to a statement of the form .8x/ ≈íP .x/¬ç is an
object a in the universal set U for which P .a/ is false. It is an example that proves
that .8x/ ≈íP .x/¬ç is a false statement, and hence its negation, .9x/ ≈í:P .x/¬ç, is a
true statement.
In the preceding example, we also wrote the universally quantified statement as
a conditional statement. The number x D 1 is a counterexample for the statement
If x is a real number, then x 3 is greater than or equal to x 2 .
So the number 1 is an example that makes the hypothesis of the conditional statement true and the conclusion false. Remember that a conditional statement often
contains a ‚Äúhidden‚Äù universal quantifier. Also, recall that in Section 2.2 we saw
that the negation of the conditional statement ‚ÄúIf P then Q‚Äù is the statement ‚ÄúP
and not Q.‚Äù Symbolically, this can be written as follows:
: .P ! Q/  P ^ :Q:
So when we specifically include the universal quantifier, the symbolic form of the
negation of a conditional statement is
: .8x 2 U / ≈íP .x/ ! Q.x/¬ç  .9x 2 U / : ≈íP .x/ ! Q.x/¬ç
 .9x 2 U / ≈íP .x/ ^ :Q.x/¬ç :

That is,
: .8x 2 U / ≈íP .x/ ! Q.x/¬ç  .9x 2 U / ≈íP .x/ ^ :Q.x/¬ç :

2. For each real number x, if x is positive, then 2x 2 > x.

Quantifiers in Definitions
Definitions of terms in mathematics often involve quantifiers. These definitions are
often given in a form that does not use the symbols for quantifiers. Not only is it
important to know a definition, it is also important to be able to write a negation of
the definition. This will be illustrated with the definition of what it means to say
that a natural number is a perfect square.
Definition. A natural number n is a perfect square provided that there exists
a natural number k such that n D k 2 .
This definition can be written in symbolic form using appropriate quantifiers
as follows:

A natural number n is a perfect square provided .9k 2 N/ n D k 2 .

We frequently use the following steps to gain a better understanding of a definition.
1. Examples of natural numbers that are perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, and 81 since
1 D 12 , 4 D 22 , 9 D 32 , and 81 D 92 .
2. Examples of natural numbers that are not perfect squares are 2, 5, 10, and
50.
3. This definition gives two ‚Äúconditions.‚Äù One is that the natural number n is a
perfect square and the other is that there exists a natural number k such that
n D k 2 . The definition states that these mean the same thing. So when we
say that a natural number n is not a perfect square, we need to negate the
condition that there exists a natural number k such that n D k 2 . We can use
the symbolic form to do this.

2.4. Quantifiers and Negations

71



: .9k 2 N/ n D k 2  .8k 2 N/ n ¬§ k 2


Notice that
instead of writing : n D k 2 , we used the equivalent form of

n ¬§ k 2 . This will be easier to translate into an English sentence. So we
can write,
A natural number n is not a perfect square provided that for every natural number k, n ¬§ k 2 .
The preceding method illustrates a good method for trying to understand a new
definition. Most textbooks will simply define a concept and leave it to the reader
to do the preceding steps. Frequently, it is not sufficient just to read a definition
and expect to understand the new term. We must provide examples that satisfy the
definition, as well as examples that do not satisfy the definition, and we must be
able to write a coherent negation of the definition

Chapter 2. Logical Reasoning

Statements with More than One Quantifier
When a predicate contains more than one variable, each variable must be quantified
to create a statement. For example, assume the universal set is the set of integers,
Z, and let P .x; y/ be the predicate, ‚Äúx C y D 0.‚Äù We can create a statement from
this predicate in several ways.
1. .8x 2 Z/ .8y 2 Z/ .x C y D 0/.

We could read this as, ‚ÄúFor all integers x and y, x C y D 0.‚Äù This is a
false statement since it is possible to find two integers whose sum is not zero
.2 C 3 ¬§ 0/.

2. .8x 2 Z/ .9y 2 Z/ .x C y D 0/.

We could read this as, ‚ÄúFor every integer x, there exists an integer y such
that x C y D 0.‚Äù This is a true statement.

3. .9x 2 Z/ .8y 2 Z/ .x C y D 0/.

We could read this as, ‚ÄúThere exists an integer x such that for each integer
y, x C y D 0.‚Äù This is a false statement since there is no integer whose sum
with each integer is zero.

4. .9x 2 Z/ .9y 2 Z/ .x C y D 0/.

We could read this as, ‚ÄúThere exist integers x and y such that
x C y D 0.‚Äù This is a true statement. For example, 2 C . 2/ D 0.

When we negate a statement with more than one quantifier, we consider each quantifier in turn and apply the appropriate part of Theorem 2.16. As an example, we
will negate Statement (3) from the preceding list. The statement is
.9x 2 Z/ .8y 2 Z/ .x C y D 0/ :
We first treat this as a statement in the following form: .9x 2 Z/ .P .x// where
P .x/ is the predicate .8y 2 Z/ .x C y D 0/. Using Theorem 2.16, we have
: .9x 2 Z/ .P .x//  .8x 2 Z/ .:P .x// :
Using Theorem 2.16 again, we obtain the following:
:P .x/  : .8y 2 Z/ .x C y D 0/
 .9y 2 Z/ : .x C y D 0/
 .9y 2 Z/ .x C y ¬§ 0/ :

2.4. Quantifiers and Negations

73

Combining these two results, we obtain
: .9x 2 Z/ .8y 2 Z/ .x C y D 0/  .8x 2 Z/ .9y 2 Z/ .x C y ¬§ 0/ :
The results are summarized in the following table.

Explorations and Activities
13. Prime Numbers. The following definition of a prime number is very important in many areas of mathematics. We will use this definition at various
places in the text. It is introduced now as an example of how to work with a
definition in mathematics.

Definition. A natural number p is a prime number provided that it is greater
than 1 and the only natural numbers that are factors of p are 1 and p. A natural
number other than 1 that is not a prime number is a composite number. The
number 1 is neither prime nor composite.
Using the definition of a prime number, we see that 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime
numbers. Also, 4 is a composite number since 4 D 2  2; 10 is a composite
number since 10 D 2  5; and 60 is a composite number since 60 D 4  15.
(a) Give examples of four natural numbers other than 2, 3, 5, and 7 that are

For all d 2 N, if d is a factor of p, then d D 1 or d D p.
(c) Give examples of four natural numbers that are composite numbers and
explain why they are composite numbers.
(d) Write a useful description of what it means to say that a natural number
is a composite number (other than saying that it is not prime).

(g) Are your examples in Part (14d) consistent with your work in Part (14f)?
Explain.
15. Least Upper Bound for a Subset of R. In Exercise 14, we introduced the
definition of an upper bound for a subset of the real numbers. Assume that
we know this definition and that we know what it means to say that a number
is not an upper bound for a subset of the real numbers.
Let A be a subset of R. A real number Àõ is the least upper bound for A
provided that Àõ is an upper bound for A, and if Àá is an upper bound for A,
then Àõ  Àá.

Note: The symbol Àõ is the lowercase Greek letter alpha, and the symbol Àá
is the lowercase Greek letter beta.

If we define P .x/ to be ‚Äúx is an upper bound for A,‚Äù then we can write the
definition for least upper bound as follows:

Constructing and Writing Proofs
in Mathematics
3.1

Direct Proofs

Preview Activity 1 (Definition of Divides, Divisor, Multiple)
In Section 1.2, we studied the concepts of even integers and odd integers. The
definition of an even integer was a formalization of our concept of an even integer
as being one that is ‚Äúdivisible by 2,‚Äù or a ‚Äúmultiple of 2.‚Äù We could also say that if
‚Äú2 divides an integer,‚Äù then that integer is an even integer. We will now extend this
idea to integers other than 2. Following is a formal definition of what it means to
say that a nonzero integer m divides an integer n.
Definition. A nonzero integer m divides an integer n provided that there is
an integer q such that n D m  q. We also say that m is a divisor of n, m is
a factor of n, and n is a multiple of m. The integer 0 is not a divisor of any
integer. If a and b are integers and a ¬§ 0, we frequently use the notation a j b
as a shorthand for ‚Äúa divides b.‚Äù
A Note about Notation: Be careful with the notation a j b. This does not represent
a
the rational number . The notation a j b represents a relationship between the
b
integers a and b and is simply a shorthand for ‚Äúa divides b.‚Äù
A Note about Definitions: Technically, a definition in mathematics should almost
always be written using ‚Äúif and only if.‚Äù It is not clear why, but the convention in
82

3.1. Direct Proofs

83

mathematics is to replace the phrase ‚Äúif and only if‚Äù with ‚Äúif‚Äù or an equivalent. Perhaps this is a bit of laziness or the ‚Äúif and only if‚Äù phrase can be a bit cumbersome.
In this text, we will often use the phrase ‚Äúprovided that‚Äù instead.
The definition for ‚Äúdivides‚Äù can be written in symbolic form using appropriate
quantifiers as follows: A nonzero integer m divides an integer n provided that
.9q 2 Z/ .n D m  q/.
1. Use the definition of divides to explain why 4 divides 32 and to explain why
8 divides 96.
2. Give several examples of two integers where the first integer does not divide
the second integer.
3. According to the definition of ‚Äúdivides,‚Äù does the integer 10 divide the integer 0? That is, is 10 a divisor of 0? Explain.
4. Use the definition of ‚Äúdivides‚Äù to complete the following sentence in symbolic form: ‚ÄúThe nonzero integer m does not divide the integer n means that
. . . .‚Äù
5. Use the definition of ‚Äúdivides‚Äù to complete the following sentence without
using the symbols for quantifiers: ‚ÄúThe nonzero integer m does not divide
the integer n : : : :‚Äù
6. Give three different examples of three integers where the first integer divides
the second integer and the second integer divides the third integer.
As we have seen in Section 1.2, a definition is frequently used when constructing
and writing mathematical proofs. Consider the following conjecture:
Conjecture: Let a, b, and c be integers with a ¬§ 0 and b ¬§ 0. If a divides b and
b divides c, then a divides c.
7. Explain why the examples you generated in part (6) provide evidence that
this conjecture is true.
In Section 1.2, we also learned how to use a know-show table to help organize our
thoughts when trying to construct a proof of a statement. If necessary, review the
appropriate material in Section 1.2.
8. State precisely what we would assume if we were trying to write a proof of
the preceding conjecture.

84

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics
9. Use the definition of ‚Äúdivides‚Äù to make some conclusions based on your
assumptions in part (8).

10. State precisely what we would be trying to prove if we were trying to write
a proof of the conjecture.
11. Use the definition of divides to write an answer to the question, ‚ÄúHow can
we prove what we stated in part (10)?

times.
(e) What do the numbers you obtained in Part (3d) have in common?

Some Mathematical Terminology
In Section 1.2, we introduced the idea of a direct proof. Since then, we have used
some common terminology in mathematics without much explanation. Before we
proceed further, we will discuss some frequently used mathematical terms.
A proof in mathematics is a convincing argument that some mathematical
statement is true. A proof should contain enough mathematical detail to be convincing to the person(s) to whom the proof is addressed. In essence, a proof is
an argument that communicates a mathematical truth to another person (who has
the appropriate mathematical background). A proof must use correct, logical reasoning and be based on previously established results. These previous results can
be axioms, definitions, or previously proven theorems. These terms are discussed
below.
Surprising to some is the fact that in mathematics, there are always undefined
terms. This is because if we tried to define everything, we would end up going in circles. Simply put, we must start somewhere. For example, in Euclidean
geometry, the terms ‚Äúpoint,‚Äù ‚Äúline,‚Äù and ‚Äúcontains‚Äù are undefined terms. In this
text, we are using our number systems such as the natural numbers and integers
as undefined terms. We often assume that these undefined objects satisfy certain
properties. These assumed relationships are accepted as true without proof and
are called axioms (or postulates). An axiom is a mathematical statement that is
accepted without proof. Euclidean geometry starts with undefined terms and a set
of postulates and axioms. For example, the following statement is an axiom of
Euclidean geometry:

86

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics
Given any two distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains these two
points.

The closure properties of the number systems discussed in Section 1.1 and the
properties of the number systems in Table 1.2 on page 18 are being used as
axioms in this text.
A definition is simply an agreement as to the meaning of a particular term.
For example, in this text, we have defined the terms ‚Äúeven integer‚Äù and ‚Äúodd integer.‚Äù Definitions are not made at random, but rather, a definition is usually made
because a certain property is observed to occur frequently. As a result, it becomes
convenient to give this property its own special name. Definitions that have been
made can be used in developing mathematical proofs. In fact, most proofs require
the use of some definitions.
In dealing with mathematical statements, we frequently use the terms ‚Äúconjecture,‚Äù ‚Äútheorem,‚Äù ‚Äúproposition,‚Äù ‚Äúlemma,‚Äù and ‚Äúcorollary.‚Äù A conjecture is a
statement that we believe is plausible. That is, we think it is true, but we have not
yet developed a proof that it is true. A theorem is a mathematical statement for
which we have a proof. A term that is often considered to be synonymous with
‚Äútheorem‚Äù is proposition.
Often the proof of a theorem can be quite long. In this case, it is often easier
to communicate the proof in smaller ‚Äúpieces.‚Äù These supporting pieces are often
called lemmas. A lemma is a true mathematical statement that was proven mainly
to help in the proof of some theorem. Once a given theorem has been proven, it
is often the case that other propositions follow immediately from the fact that the
theorem is true. These are called corollaries of the theorem. The term corollary is
used to refer to a theorem that is easily proven once some other theorem has been
proven.

Constructing Mathematical Proofs
To create a proof of a theorem, we must use correct logical reasoning and mathematical statements that we already accept as true. These statements include axioms,
definitions, theorems, lemmas, and corollaries.
In Section 1.2, we introduced the use of a know-show table to help us organize
our work when we are attempting to prove a statement. We also introduced some
guidelines for writing mathematical proofs once we have created the proof. These
guidelines should be reviewed before proceeding.

3.1. Direct Proofs

87

Please remember that when we start the process of writing a proof, we are
essentially ‚Äúreporting the news.‚Äù That is, we have already discovered the proof,
and now we need to report it. This reporting often does not describe the process of
discovering the news (the investigative portion of the process).
Quite often, the first step is to develop a conjecture. This is often done after
working within certain objects for some time. This is what we did in Preview Activity 1 when we used examples to provide evidence that the following conjecture
is true:
Conjecture: Let a, b, and c be integers with a ¬§ 0 and b ¬§ 0. If a divides b and
b divides c, then a divides c.
Before we try to prove a conjecture, we should make sure we have explored
some examples. This simply means to construct some specific examples where the
integers a, b, and c satisfy the hypothesis of the conjecture in order to see if they
also satisfy the conclusion. We did this for this conjecture in Preview Activity 1.
We will now start a know-show table for this conjecture.

The backward question we ask is, ‚ÄúHow can we prove that a divides c?‚Äù One
answer is to use the definition and show that there exists an integer q such that
c D a  q. This could be step Q1 in the know-show table.
We now have to prove that a certain integer q exists, so we ask the question,
‚ÄúHow do we prove that this integer exists?‚Äù When we are at such a stage in the
backward process of a proof, we usually turn to what is known in order to prove
that the object exists or to find or construct the object we are trying to prove exists.
We often say that we try to ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù the object or at least prove it exists from
the known information. So at this point, we go to the forward part of the proof to
try to prove that there exists an integer q such that c D a  q.
The forward question we ask is, ‚ÄúWhat can we conclude from the facts that
a j b and b j c?‚Äù Again, using the definition, we know that there exist integers s

88

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics

and t such that b D a  s and c D b  t . This could be step P1 in the know-show
table.
The key now is to determine how to get from P1 to Q1. That is, can we use the
conclusions that the integers s and t exist in order to prove that the integer q (from
the backward process) exists. Using the equation b D a  s, we can substitute a  s
for b in the second equation, c D b  t . This gives
c D b t
D .a  s/  t
D a.s  t /:

The last step used the associative property of multiplication. (See Table 1.2 on
page 18.) This shows that c is equal to a times some integer. (This is because s  t
is an integer by the closure property for integers.) So although we did not use the
letter q, we have arrived at step Q1. The completed know-show table follows.

Definition of ‚Äúdivides‚Äù

Notice the similarities between what we did for this proof and many of the proofs
about even and odd integers we constructed in Section 1.2. When we try to prove
that a certain object exists, we often use what is called the construction method
for a proof. The appearance of an existential quantifier in the show (or backward)
portion of the proof is usually the indicator to go to what is known in order to prove
the object exists.
We can now report the news by writing a formal proof.
Theorem 3.1. Let a, b, and c be integers with a ¬§ 0 and b ¬§ 0. If a divides b
and b divides c, then a divides c.

3.1. Direct Proofs

89

Proof. We assume that a, b, and c are integers with a ¬§ 0 and b ¬§ 0. We further
assume that a divides b and that b divides c. We will prove that a divides c.
Since a divides b and b divides c, there exist integers s and t such that
b D a  s; and
c D b  t:

(1)
(2)

We can now substitute the expression for b from equation (1) into equation (2).
This gives
c D .a  s/  t:
Using the associate property for multiplication, we can rearrange the right side of
the last equation to obtain
c D a  .s  t /:
Because both s and t are integers, and since the integers are closed under multiplication, we know that s  t 2 Z. Therefore, the previous equation proves that a
divides c. Consequently, we have proven that whenever a, b, and c are integers
with a ¬§ 0 and b ¬§ 0 such that a divides b and b divides c, then a divides c. 

Writing Guidelines for Equation Numbers
We wrote the proof for Theorem 3.1 according to the guidelines introduced in
Section 1.2, but a new element that appeared in this proof was the use of equation
numbers. Following are some guidelines that can be used for equation numbers.
If it is necessary to refer to an equation later in a proof, that equation should
be centered and displayed. It should then be given a number. The number for the
equation should be written in parentheses on the same line as the equation at the
right-hand margin as in shown in the following example.
Since x is an odd integer, there exists an integer n such that
x D 2n C 1:
Later in the proof, there may be a line such as
Then, using the result in equation (1), we obtain . . . .

(1)

90

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics

Notice that we did not number every equation in Theorem 3.1. We should only
number those equations we will be referring to later in the proof, and we should
only number equations when it is necessary. For example, instead of numbering
an equation, it is often better to use a phrase such as, ‚Äúthe previous equation
proves that . . . ‚Äù or ‚Äúwe can rearrange the terms on the right side of the previous
equation.‚Äù Also, note that the word ‚Äúequation‚Äù is not capitalized when we are
referring to an equation by number. Although it may be appropriate to use a
capital ‚ÄúE,‚Äù the usual convention in mathematics is not to capitalize.
Progress Check 3.2 (A Property of Divisors)
1. Give at least four different examples of integers a, b, and c with a ¬§ 0 such
that a divides b and a divides c.
2. For each example in Part (1), calculate the sum b C c. Does the integer a
divide the sum b C c?
3. Construct a know-show table for the following proposition: For all integers
a, b, and c with a ¬§ 0, if a divides b and a divides c, then a divides .b C c/.

Using Counterexamples
In Section 1.2 and so far in this section, our focus has been on proving statements
that involve universal quantifiers. However, another important skill for mathematicians is to be able to recognize when a statement is false and then to be able to prove
that it is false. For example, suppose we want to know if the following proposition
is true or false.

For each integer n, if 5 divides n2 1 , then 5 divides .n 1/.

Suppose we start trying to prove this proposition. In the backward process, we
would say that in order to prove that 5 divides .n 1/, we can show that there
exists an integer k such that
Q1 W n

1 D 5k

or n D 5k C 1:

For the forward process, we could say that since 5 divides n2
there exists an integer m such that
P1 W n2

1 D 5m

or n2 D 5m C 1:


1 , we know that

3.1. Direct Proofs

91

The problem is that there is no straightforward way to use P1 to prove Q1 . At
this point, it would be a good idea to try some examples for n and try to find
situations in which the hypothesis of the proposition is true. (In fact, this should
have been done before we started trying to prove the proposition.) The following
table summarizes the results of some of these explorations with values for n.

We can stop exploring examples now since the last row in the table provides an
example where the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false. Recall from
Section 2.4 (see page 69) that a counterexample for a statement of the form
.8x 2 U / .P .x// is an element a in the universal set for which P .a/ is false. So
we have actually proved that the negation of the proposition is true.
When using a counterexample to prove a statement is false, we do not use the
term ‚Äúproof‚Äù since we reserve a proof for proving a proposition is true. We could
summarize our work as follows:

Conjecture. For each integer n, if 5 divides n2 1 , then 5 divides
.n 1/.
The integer n D 4 is a counterexample that proves this conjecture is false.
Notice that when n D 4, n2 1 D 15 and 5 divides 15. Hence, the
hypothesis of the conjecture is true in this case. In addition, n 1 D 3
and 5 does not divide 3 and so the conclusion of the conjecture is false in
this case. Since this is an example where the hypothesis is true and the
conclusion is false, the conjecture is false.
As a general rule of thumb, anytime we are trying to decide if a proposition is true
or false, it is a good idea to try some examples first. The examples that are chosen
should be ones in which the hypothesis of the proposition is true. If one of these
examples makes the conclusion false, then we have found a counterexample and
we know the proposition is false. If all of the examples produce a true conclusion,
then we have evidence that the proposition is true and can try to write a proof.
Progress Check 3.3 (Using a Counterexample)
Use a counterexample to prove the following statement is false.
For all integers a and b, if 5 divides a or 5 divides b, then 5 divides .5a C b/.

Congruence
What mathematicians call congruence is a concept used to describe cycles in the
world of the integers. For example, the day of the week is a cyclic phenomenon in
that the day of the week repeats every seven days. The time of the day is a cyclic
phenomenon because it repeats every 12 hours if we use a 12-hour clock or every
24 hours if we use a 24-hour clock. We explored these two cyclic phenomena in
Preview Activity 2.
Similar to what we saw in Preview Activity 2, if it is currently Monday, then it
will be Wednesday 2 days from now, 9 days from now, 16 days from now, 23 days
from now, and so on. In addition, it was Wednesday 5 days ago, 12 days ago, 19
days ago, and so on. Using negative numbers for time in the past, we generate the
following list of numbers:
:::;

19; 12; 5; 2; 9; 16; 23; : : : :

Notice that if we subtract any number in the list above from any other number
in that list, we will obtain a multiple of 7. For example,
16
. 5/
16

2 D 14 D 7  2

.9/ D

14 D 7  . 2/

. 12/ D 28 D 7  4:

Using the concept of congruence, we would say that all the numbers in this
list are congruent modulo 7, but we first have to define when two numbers are
congruent modulo some natural number n.
Definition. Let n 2 N. If a and b are integers, then we say that a is congruent
to b modulo n provided that n divides a b. A standard notation for this is
a  b .mod n/. This is read as ‚Äúa is congruent to b modulo n‚Äù or ‚Äúa is
congruent to b mod n.‚Äù
Notice that we can use the definition of divides to say that n divides .a
only if there exists an integer k such that a b D nk. So we can write
a  b .mod n/ means .9k 2 Z/ .a

b D nk/ ; or

a  b .mod n/ means .9k 2 Z/ .a D b C nk/ :

b/ if and

3.1. Direct Proofs

93

This means that in order to find integers that are congruent to b modulo n,
we only need to add multiples of n to b. For example, to find integers that are
congruent to 2 modulo 5, we add multiples of 5 to 2. This gives the following list:
:::

13; 8; 3; 2; 7; 12; 17; : : ::

We can also write this using set notation and say that
f a 2 Zj a  2 .mod 5/g D f: : :

13; 8; 3; 2; 7; 12; 17; : : :g :

Progress Check 3.4 (Congruence Modulo 8)
1. Determine at least eight different integers that are congruent to 5 modulo 8.
2. Use set builder notation and the roster method to specify the set of all integers
that are congruent to 5 modulo 8.
3. Choose two integers that are congruent to 5 modulo 8 and add them. Then
repeat this for at least five other pairs of integers that are congruent to 5
modulo 8.
4. Explain why all of the sums that were obtained in Part (3) are congruent to
2 modulo 8.
We will study the concept of congruence modulo n in much more detail later
in the text. For now, we will work with the definition of congruence modulo n in
the context of proofs. For example, all of the examples used in Progress Check 3.4
should provide evidence that the following proposition is true.
Proposition 3.5. For all integers a and b, if a  5 .mod 8/ and b  5 .mod 8/,
then .a C b/  2 .mod 8/.
Progress Check 3.6 (Proving Proposition 3.5)
We will use ‚Äúbackward questions‚Äù and ‚Äúforward questions‚Äù to help construct a
proof for Proposition 3.5. So, we might ask, ‚ÄúHow do we prove that .a C b/ 
2 .mod 8/?‚Äù One way to answer this is to use the definition of congruence and
state that .a C b/  2 .mod 8/ provided that 8 divides .a C b 2/.
1. Use the definition of divides to determine a way to prove that 8 divides .a C
b 2/.

94

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics

We now turn to what we know and ask, ‚ÄúWhat can we conclude from the assumptions that a  5 .mod 8/ and b  5 .mod 8/.‚Äù We can again use the
definition of congruence and conclude that 8 divides .a 5/ and 8 divides .b 5/.
2. Use the definition of divides to make conclusions based on the facts that 8
divides .a 5/ and 8 divides .b 5/.
3. Solve an equation from part (2) for a and for b.
4. Use the results from part (3) to prove that 8 divides .a C b

2/.

5. Write a proof for Proposition 3.5.

Additional Writing Guidelines
We will now be writing many proofs, and it is important to make sure we write
according to accepted guidelines so that our proofs may be understood by others. Some writing guidelines were introduced in Chapter 1. The first four writing
guidelines given below can be considered general guidelines, and the last three can
be considered as technical guidelines specific to writing in mathematics.
1. Know your audience. Every writer should have a clear idea of the intended
audience for a piece of writing. In that way, the writer can give the right
amount of information at the proper level of sophistication to communicate
effectively. This is especially true for mathematical writing. For example, if
a mathematician is writing a solution to a textbook problem for a solutions
manual for instructors, the writing would be brief with many details omitted.
However, if the writing was for a students‚Äô solution manual, more details
would be included.
2. Use complete sentences and proper paragraph structure. Good grammar
is an important part of any writing. Therefore, conform to the accepted rules
of grammar. Pay careful attention to the structure of sentences. Write proofs
using complete sentences but avoid run-on sentences. Also, do not forget
punctuation, and always use a spell checker when using a word processor.
3. Keep it simple. It is often difficult to understand a mathematical argument
no matter how well it is written. Do not let your writing help make it more
difficult for the reader. Use simple, declarative sentences and short paragraphs, each with a simple point.

3.1. Direct Proofs

95

4. Write a first draft of your proof and then revise it. Remember that a proof
is written so that readers are able to read and understand the reasoning in the
proof. Be clear and concise. Include details but do not ramble. Do not be
satisfied with the first draft of a proof. Read it over and refine it. Just like
any worthwhile activity, learning to write mathematics well takes practice
and hard work. This can be frustrating. Everyone can be sure that there will
be some proofs that are difficult to construct, but remember that proofs are a
very important part of mathematics. So work hard and have fun.
5. Do not use  for multiplication or ÀÜ for exponents. Leave this type of
notation for writing computer code. The use of this notation makes it difficult
for humans to read. In addition, avoid using = for division when using a
complex fraction.

For example, it is very difficult to read x 3 3x 2 C 1=2 =.2x=3 7/; the
fraction
1
x 3 3x 2 C
2
2x
7
3
is much easier to read.
6. Do not use a mathematical symbol at the beginning of a sentence. For
example, we should not write, ‚ÄúLet n be an integer. n is an odd integer
provided that . . . .‚Äù Many people find this hard to read and often have to reread it to understand it. It would be better to write, ‚ÄúAn integer n is an odd
integer provided that . . . .‚Äù
7. Use English and minimize the use of cumbersome notation. Do not use
the special symbols for quantifiers 8 (for all), 9 (there exists), √ñ (such that),
or ) (therefore) in formal mathematical writing. It is often easier to write,
and usually easier to read, if the English words are used instead of the symbols. For example, why make the reader interpret
.8x 2 R/ .9y 2 R/ .x C y D 0/
when it is possible to write
For each real number x, there exists a real number y such that x C y D 0,
or, more succinctly (if appropriate),
Every real number has an additive inverse.

This type of exercise will appear frequently in the book. In each case, there
is a proposed proof of a proposition. However, the proposition may be true

 If a proposition is false, the proposed proof is, of course, incorrect. In
this situation, you are to find the error in the proof and then provide a
counterexample showing that the proposition is false.
 If a proposition is true, the proposed proof may still be incorrect. In this
case, you are to determine why the proof is incorrect and then write a
correct proof using the writing guidelines that have been presented in
this book.
 If a proposition is true and the proof is correct, you are to decide if the
proof is well written or not. If it is well written, then you simply must
indicate that this is an excellent proof and needs no revision. On the
other hand, if the proof is not well written, then you must then revise
the proof by writing it according to the guidelines presented in this text.

Explain.

Review of Direct Proofs
In Sections 1.2 and 3.1, we studied direct proofs of mathematical statements. Most
of the statements we prove in mathematics are conditional statements that can be
written in the form P ! Q. A direct proof of a statement of the form P ! Q
is based on the definition that a conditional statement can only be false when the
hypothesis, P , is true and the conclusion, Q, is false. Thus, if the conclusion is
true whenever the hypothesis is true, then the conditional statement must be true.
So, in a direct proof,
 We start by assuming that P is true.
 From this assumption, we logically deduce that Q is true.
We have used the so-called forward and backward method to discover how to logically deduce Q from the assumption that P is true.

Proof Using the Contrapositive
As we saw in Preview Activity 1, it is sometimes difficult to construct a direct proof
of a conditional statement. This is one reason we studied logical equivalencies in
Section 2.2. Knowing that two expressions are logically equivalent tells us that if
we prove one, then we have also proven the other. In fact, once we know the truth
value of a statement, then we know the truth value of any other statement that is
logically equivalent to it.
One of the most useful logical equivalencies in this regard is that a conditional
statement P ! Q is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, :Q ! :P . This

3.2. More Methods of Proof

105

means that if we prove the contrapositive of the conditional statement, then we
have proven the conditional statement. The following are some important points to
remember.
 A conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.
 Use a direct proof to prove that :Q ! :P is true.
 Caution: One difficulty with this type of proof is in the formation of correct
negations. (We need to be very careful doing this.)
 We might consider using a proof by contrapositive when the statements P
and Q are stated as negations.

Writing Guidelines
One of the basic rules of writing mathematical proofs is to keep the reader informed. So when we prove a result using the contrapositive, we indicate this within
the first few lines of the proof. For example,
 We will prove this theorem by proving its contrapositive.
 We will prove the contrapositive of this statement.
In addition, make sure the reader knows the status of every assertion that you
make. That is, make sure you state whether an assertion is an assumption of the
theorem, a previously proven result, a well-known result, or something from the
reader‚Äôs mathematical background. Following is a completed proof of a statement
from Preview Activity 1.
Theorem 3.7. For each integer n, if n2 is an even integer, then n is an even integer.
Proof. We will prove this result by proving the contrapositive of the statement,
which is
For each integer n, if n is an odd integer, then n2 is an odd integer.
However, in Theorem 1.8 on page 21, we have already proven that if x and y are
odd integers, then x  y is an odd integer. So using x D y D n, we can conclude
that if n is an odd integer, then n  n, or n2 , is an odd integer. We have thus proved
the contrapositive of the theorem, and consequently, we have proved that if n2 is
an even integer, then n is an even integer.

Using Other Logical Equivalencies
As was noted in Section 2.2, there are several different logical equivalencies. Fortunately, there are only a small number that we often use when trying to write
proofs, and many of these are listed in Theorem 2.8 at the end of Section 2.2.
We will illustrate the use of one of these logical equivalencies with the following
proposition:
For all real numbers a and b, if a ¬§ 0 and b ¬§ 0, then ab ¬§ 0.
First, notice that the hypothesis and the conclusion of the conditional statement are
stated in the form of negations. This suggests that we consider the contrapositive.
Care must be taken when we negate the hypothesis since it is a conjunction. We
use one of De Morgan‚Äôs Laws as follows:
: .a ¬§ 0 ^ b ¬§ 0/  .a D 0/ _ .b D 0/ :
Progress Check 3.8 (Using Another Logical Equivalency)
1. In English, write the contrapositive of, ‚ÄúFor all real numbers a and b, if
a ¬§ 0 and b ¬§ 0, then ab ¬§ 0.‚Äù
The contrapositive is a conditional statement in the form X ! .Y _ Z/. The
difficulty is that there is not much we can do with the hypothesis .ab D 0/ since
we know nothing else about the real numbers a and b. However, if we knew that a
was not equal to zero, then we could multiply both sides of the equation ab D 0 by
1
. This suggests that we consider using the following logical equivalency based
a
on a result in Theorem 2.8 on page 48:
X ! .Y _ Z/  .X ^ :Y / ! Z:
2. In English, use this logical equivalency, to write a statement that is logically
equivalent to the contrapositive from Part (1).
The logical equivalency in Part (2) makes sense because if we are trying to
prove Y _ Z, we only need to prove that at least one of Y or Z is true. So the idea
is to prove that if Y is false, then Z must be true.
3. Use the ideas presented in the progress check to complete the proof of the
following proposition.

Proposition 3.9. For all real numbers a and b, if a ¬§ 0 and b ¬§ 0, then
ab ¬§ 0.
Proof. We will prove the contrapositive of this proposition, which is
For all real numbers a and b, if ab D 0, then a D 0 or b D 0.
This contrapositive, however, is logically equivalent to the following:
For all real numbers a and b, if ab D 0 and a ¬§ 0, then b D 0.
To prove this, we let a and b be real numbers and assume that ab D 0 and a ¬§ 0.

We can then multiply both sides of the equation ab D 0 by . This gives

Therefore, b D 0. This completes the proof of a statement that is logically
equivalent to the contrapositive, and hence, we have proven the proposition.

Proofs of Biconditional Statements
In Preview Activity 2, we used the following logical equivalency:
.P $ Q/  .P ! Q/ ^ .Q ! P / :
This logical equivalency suggests one method for proving a biconditional statement
written in the form ‚ÄúP if and only if Q.‚Äù This method is to construct separate
proofs of the two conditional statements P ! Q and Q ! P . For example, since
we have now proven each of the following:
 For each integer n, if n is an even integer, then n2 is an even integer. (Exercise (3c) on page 27 in Section 1.2)
 For each integer n, if n2 is an even integer, then n is an even integer. (Theorem 3.7)
we can state the following theorem.

108

Theorem 3.10. For each integer n, n is an even integer if and only if n2 is an even
integer.

Writing Guidelines
When proving a biconditional statement using the logical equivalency
.P $ Q/  .P ! Q/ ^ .Q ! P /, we actually need to prove two conditional
statements. The proof of each conditional statement can be considered as one of
two parts of the proof of the biconditional statement. Make sure that the start and
end of each of these parts is indicated clearly. This is illustrated in the proof of the
following proposition.
Proposition 3.11. Let x 2 R.
x 3 2x 2 C x D 2.

The real number x equals 2 if and only if

Proof. We will prove this biconditional statement by proving the following two
conditional statements:
 For each real number x, if x equals 2 , then x 3
 For each real number x, if x 3

2x 2 C x D 2.

2x 2 C x D 2, then x equals 2.

For the first part, we assume x D 2 and prove that x 3 2x 2 C x D 2. We can
do this by substituting x D 2 into the expression x 3 2x 2 C x. This gives

x 3 2x 2 C x D 23 2 22 C 2
D8

D 2:

8C2

This completes the first part of the proof.
For the second part, we assume that x 3 2x 2 C x D 2 and from this assumption,
we will prove that x D 2. We will do this by solving this equation for x. To do so,
we first rewrite the equation x 3 2x 2 C x D 2 by subtracting 2 from both sides:
x3

2x 2 C x

2 D 0:

We can now factor the left side of this equation by factoring an x 2 from the first
two terms and then factoring .x 2/ from the resulting two terms. This is shown

Now, in the real numbers, if a product of two factors is equal to zero, then one of
the factors must be zero. So this last equation implies that
x

2 D 0 or x 2 C 1 D 0:

The equation x 2 C 1 D 0 has no real number solution. So since x is a real
number, the only possibility is that x 2 D 0. From this we can conclude that x
must be equal to 2.
Since we have now proven both conditional statements, we have proven that
x D 2 if and only if x 3 2x 2 C x D 2.


Constructive Proofs
We all know how to solve an equation such as 3x C 8 D 23, where x is a real
number. To do so, we first add 8 to both sides of the equation and then divide
both sides of the resulting equation by 3. Doing so, we obtain the following result:
If x is a real number and 3x C 8 D 23, then x D 5.
Notice that the process of solving the equation actually does not prove that
x D 5 is a solution of the equation 3x C 8 D 23. This process really shows that if
there is a solution, then that solution must be x D 5. To show that this is a solution,
we use the process of substituting 5 for x in the left side of the equation as follows:
If x D 5, then
3x C 8 D 3 .5/ C 8 D 15 C 8 D 23:
This proves that x D 5 is a solution of the equation 3x C 8 D 23. Hence, we
have proven that x D 5 is the only real number solution of 3x C 8 D 23.
We can use this same process to show that any linear equation has a real number
solution. An equation of the form
ax C b D c;

110

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics

where a, b, and c are real numbers with a ¬§ 0, is called a linear equation in one

Proof. Assume that a, b, and c are real numbers with a ¬§ 0. We can solve the
linear equation ax C b D c by adding b to both sides of the equation and then

The proof given for Proposition 3.12 is called a constructive proof. This is a
technique that is often used to prove a so-called existence theorem. The objective
of an existence theorem is to prove that a certain mathematical object exists. That
is, the goal is usually to prove a statement of the form
There exists an x such that P .x/.
For a constructive proof of such a proposition, we actually name, describe, or explain how to construct some object in the universe that makes P .x/ true. This is
c b
what we did in Proposition 3.12 since in the proof, we actually proved that
a
is a solution of the equation ax C b D c. In fact, we proved that this is the only
solution of this equation.

3.2. More Methods of Proof

111

Nonconstructive Proofs
Another type of proof that is often used to prove an existence theorem is the socalled nonconstructive proof. For this type of proof, we make an argument that an
object in the universal set that makes P .x/ true must exist but we never construct
or name the object that makes P .x/ true. The advantage of a constructive proof
over a nonconstructive proof is that the constructive proof will yield a procedure or
algorithm for obtaining the desired object.
The proof of the Intermediate Value Theorem from calculus is an example of
a nonconstructive proof. The Intermediate Value Theorem can be stated as follows:
If f is a continuous function on the closed interval ≈ía; b¬ç and if q is any real
number strictly between f .a/ and f .b/, then there exists a number c in the
interval .a; b/ such that f .c/ D q.
The Intermediate Value Theorem can be used to prove that a solution to some
equations must exist. This is shown in the next example.
Example 3.13 (Using the Intermediate Value Theorem)
Let x represent a real number. We will use the Intermediate Value Theorem to
prove that the equation x 3 x C 1 D 0 has a real number solution.

To investigate solutions of the equation x 3 xC1 D 0, we will use the function
f .x/ D x 3

x C 1:

Notice that f . 2/ D 5 and that f .0/ D 1. Since f . 2/ < 0 and f .0/ > 0, the
Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that there is a real number c between 2 and
0 such that f .c/ D 0. This means that there exists a real number c between 2
and 0 such that
c3

c C 1 D 0;

and hence c is a real number solution of the equation x 3 x C 1 D 0. This proves
that the equation x 3 x C 1 D 0 has at least one real number solution.
Notice that this proof does not tell us how to find the exact value of c. It does,
however, suggest a method for approximating the value of c. This can be done by
finding smaller and smaller intervals ≈ía; b¬ç such that f .a/ and f .b/ have opposite
signs.

Proof by Contradiction

Preview Activity 1 (Proof by Contradiction)
On page 40 in Section 2.1, we defined a tautology to be a compound statement S that is true for all possible combinations of truth values of the component
statements that are part of S . We also defined contradiction to be a compound
statement that is false for all possible combinations of truth values of the component statements that are part of S .
That is, a tautology is necessarily true in all circumstances, and a contradiction
is necessarily false in all circumstances.
1. Use truth tables to explain why .P _ :P / is a tautology and .P ^ :P / is a
contradiction.
Another method of proof that is frequently used in mathematics is a proof by
contradiction. This method is based on the fact that a statement X can only be true
or false (and not both). The idea is to prove that the statement X is true by showing
that it cannot be false. This is done by assuming that X is false and proving that this
leads to a contradiction. (The contradiction often has the form .R ^ :R/, where R
is some statement.) When this happens, we can conclude that the assumption that
the statement X is false is incorrect and hence X cannot be false. Since it cannot
be false, then X must be true.

3.3. Proof by Contradiction

117

A logical basis for the contradiction method of proof is the tautology
≈í:X ! C ¬ç ! X;
where X is a statement and C is a contradiction. The following truth table establishes this tautology.
X

C

T
F

F
F

:X

T

:X ! C

.:X ! C / ! X

This tautology shows that if :X leads to a contradiction, then X must be true. The
previous truth table also shows that the statement :X ! C is logically equivalent to X . This means that if we have proved that :X leads to a contradiction,
then we have proved statement X . So if we want to prove a statement X using a
proof by contradiction, we assume that :X is true and show that this leads to a
contradiction.
When we try to prove the conditional statement, ‚ÄúIf P then Q‚Äù using a proof
by contradiction, we must assume that P ! Q is false and show that this leads to
a contradiction.
2. Use a truth table to show that : .P ! Q/ is logically equivalent to P ^:Q.
The preceding logical equivalency shows that when we assume that P ! Q is
false, we are assuming that P is true and Q is false. If we can prove that this leads
to a contradiction, then we have shown that : .P ! Q/ is false and hence that
P ! Q is true.
3. Give a counterexample to show that the following statement is false.

that will yield a true statement. This is usually done by using a conditional
statement. So instead of working with the statement in (3), we will work with
a related statement that is obtained by adding an assumption (or assumptions)
to the hypothesis.

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics
To begin a proof by contradiction for this statement, we need to assume the
negation of the statement. To do this, we need to negate the entire statement, including the quantifier. Recall that the negation of a statement with
a universal quantifier is a statement that contains an existential quantifier.
(See Theorem 2.16 on page 67). With this in mind, carefully write down
all assumptions made at the beginning of a proof by contradiction for this
statement.

For this proof by contradiction, we will only work with the know column of a

1. Try the following algebraic operations on the inequality in (2). First, multiply both sides of the inequality by xy, which is a positive real number since
x > 0 and y > 0. Then, subtract 2xy from both sides of this inequality and
finally, factor the left side of the resulting inequality.
2. Explain why the last inequality you obtained leads to a contradiction.
By obtaining a contradiction, we have proved that the proposition cannot be false,
and hence, must be true.

We can then conclude that the proposition cannot be false, and hence, must be
true. When we assume a proposition is false, we are, in effect, assuming that its
negation is true. This is one reason why it is so important to be able to write negations of propositions quickly and correctly. We will illustrate the process with the

Important Note
A proof by contradiction is often used to prove a conditional statement
P ! Q when a direct proof has not been found and it is relatively easy to form the
negation of the proposition. The advantage of a proof by contradiction is that we
have an additional assumption with which to work (since we assume not only P but
also :Q). The disadvantage is that there is no well-defined goal to work toward.
The goal is simply to obtain some contradiction. There usually is no way of telling
beforehand what that contradiction will be, so we have to stay alert for a possible
absurdity. Thus, when we set up a know-show table for a proof by contradiction,
we really only work with the know portion of the table.

and determine at least five different integers that are congruent to 3 modulo

2. For this proposition, why does it seem reasonable to try a proof by contradiction?
3. For this proposition, state clearly the assumptions that need to be made at the
beginning of a proof by contradiction, and then use a proof by contradiction
to prove this proposition.

Proving that Something Does Not Exist
In mathematics, we sometimes need to prove that something does not exist or that
something is not possible. Instead of trying to construct a direct proof, it is sometimes easier to use a proof by contradiction so that we can assume that the something exists. For example, suppose we want to prove the following proposition:
Proposition 3.17. For all integers x and y, if x and y are odd integers, then there
does not exist an integer z such that x 2 C y 2 D z 2 .
Notice that the conclusion involves trying to prove that an integer with a certain
property does not exist. If we use a proof by contradiction, we can assume that such
an integer z exists. This gives us more with which to work.
Progress Check 3.18 Complete the following proof of Proposition 3.17:
Proof. We will use a proof by contradiction. So we assume that there exist integers
x and y such that x and y are odd and there exists an integer z such that x 2 C y 2 D
z 2 . Since x and y are odd, there exist integers m and n such that x D 2m C 1 and
y D 2n C 1.
1. Use the assumptions that x and y are odd to prove that x 2 C y 2 is even and
hence, z 2 is even. (See Theorem 3.7 on page 105.)
We can now conclude that z is even. (See Theorem 3.7 on page 105.) So there
exists an integer k such that z D 2k. If we substitute for x, y, and z in the
equation x 2 C y 2 D z 2 , we obtain
.2m C 1/2 C .2n C 1/2 D .2k/2 :

Rational and Irrational Numbers
One of the most important ways to classify real numbers is as a rational number
or an irrational number. Following is the definition of rational (and irrational)
numbers given in Exercise (9) from Section 3.2.
Definition. A real number x is defined to be a rational number provided that
m
there exist integers m and n with n ¬§ 0 such that x D . A real number that
n
is not a rational number is called an irrational number.
This may seem like a strange distinction because most people are quite familiar
with the rational numbers (fractions) but the irrational numbers
p p seem
p a bit unusual.
However, there are many irrational numbers such as 2, 3, 3 2, , and the
number e. We are discussing these matters now because we will soon prove that
p
2 is irrational in Theorem 3.20.
We use the symbol Q to stand for the set of rational numbers. There is no
standard symbol for the set of irrational numbers. Perhaps one reason for this is
because of the closure properties of the rational numbers. We introduced closure
properties in Section 1.1, and the rational numbers Q are closed under addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division by nonzero rational numbers. This means
that if x; y 2 Q, then
 x C y, x

y, and xy are in Q; and

 If y ¬§ 0, then

x
is in Q.
y

The basic reasons for these facts are that if we add, subtract, multiply, or divide
two fractions, the result is a fraction. One reason we do not have a symbol for
the irrational numbers is that the irrational p
numbers are not closed under these
operations. For example, we will prove that 2 is irrational in Theorem 3.20. We
then see that
p
p p
2
2 2 D 2 and p D 1;
2

3.3. Proof by Contradiction

123

which shows that the product of irrational numbers can be rational and the quotient
of irrational numbers can be rational.
It is also important to realize that every integer is a rational number since any
3
integer can be written as a fraction. For example, we can write 3 D . In general,
1
n
if n 2 Z, then n D , and hence, n 2 Q.
1
Because the rational numbers are closed under the standard operations and the
definition of an irrational number simply says that the number is not rational, we
often use a proof by contradiction to prove that a number is irrational. This is
illustrated in the next proposition.
Proposition 3.19. For all real numbers x and y, if x is rational and x ¬§ 0 and y
is irrational, then x  y is irrational.
Proof. We will use a proof by contradiction. So we assume that there exist real
numbers x and y such that x is rational, x ¬§ 0, y is irrational, and x  y is rational.
Since x ¬§ 0, we can divide by x, and since the rational numbers are closed under
1
division by nonzero rational numbers, we know that
2 Q. We now know that
x
1
x  y and are rational numbers and since the rational numbers are closed under
x
multiplication, we conclude that
1
 .xy/ 2 Q:
x
1
However,  .xy/ D y and hence, y must be a rational number. Since a real numx
ber cannot be both rational and irrational, this is a contradiction to the assumption
that y is irrational. We have therefore proved that for all real numbers x and y, if
x is rational and x ¬§ 0 and y is irrational, then x  y is irrational.

The Square Root of 2 Is an Irrational Number
The proof that the square root of 2 is an irrational number is one of the classic
proofs in mathematics, and every mathematics student should know this proof.
This is why we will be doing some preliminary work with rational numbers and
integers before completing the proof. The theorem we will be proving can be stated
as follows:

quotient of integers with the denominator not equal to zero.
In order to complete this proof, we need to be able to work with some basic
facts that follow about rational numbers and even integers.

Item (2) was included to illustrate the fact that a rational number can be written
as a fraction in ‚Äúlowest terms‚Äù with a positive denominator. This means that any
m
rational number can be written as a quotient , where m and n are integers, n > 0,
n
and m and n have no common factor greater than 1.
3. If n is an integer and n2 is even, what can be conclude about n. Refer to
Theorem 3.7 on page 105.
In a proof by contradiction of a conditional statement P ! Q, we assume the
negation of this statement or P ^ :Q. So in a proof by contradiction of Theorem 3.20, we will assume that r is a real number, r 2 D 2, and r is not irrational
(that is, r is rational).
Theorem 3.20. If r is a real number such that r 2 D 2, then r is an irrational
number.
Proof. We will use a proof by contradiction. So we assume that the statement of
the theorem is false. That is, we assume that

3.3. Proof by Contradiction

125

r is a real number, r 2 D 2, and r is a rational number.
Since r is a rational number, there exist integers m and n with n > 0 such that
rD

m
n

and m and n have no common factor greater than 1. We will obtain a contradiction
by showing that m and n must both be even. Squaring both sides of the last equation
and using the fact that r 2 D 2, we obtain
m2
n2
2
m D 2n2 :
2D

(1)

Equation (1) implies that m2 is even, and hence, by Theorem 3.7, m must be an
even integer. This means that there exists an integer p such that m D 2p. We can
now substitute this into equation (1), which gives
.2p/2 D 2n2

4p 2 D 2n2 :

(2)

We can divide both sides of equation (2) by 2 to obtain n2 D 2p 2 . Consequently,
n2 is even and we can once again use Theorem 3.7 to conclude that m is an even
integer.
We have now established that both m and n are even. This means that 2 is a
common factor of m and n, which contradicts the assumption that m and n have no
common factor greater than 1. Consequently, the statement of the theorem cannot
be false, and we have proved that if r is a real number such that r 2 D 2, then r is
an irrational number.

Preview Activity 2 (Using Cases in a Proof)
The work in Preview Activity 1 was meant to introduce the idea of using cases
in a proof. The method of using cases is often used when the hypothesis of the
proposition is a disjunction. This is justified by the logical equivalency
≈í.P _ Q/ ! R¬ç  ≈í.P ! R/ ^ .Q ! R/¬ç :
See Theorem 2.8 on page 48 and Exercise (6) on page 50.
In some other situations when we are trying to prove a proposition or a theorem
about an element x in some set U , we often run into the problem that there does
not seem to be enough information about x to proceed. For example, consider the
following proposition:

Proposition 1. If n is an integer, then n2 C n is an even integer.

If we were trying to write a direct proof of this proposition, the only thing we could
assume is that n is an integer. This is not much help. In a situation such as this,
we will sometimes use cases to provide additional assumptions for the forward
process of the proof. Cases are usually based on some common properties that the
element x may or may not possess. The cases must be chosen so that they exhaust
all possibilities for the object x in the hypothesis of the original proposition. For
Proposition 1, we know that an integer must be even or it must be odd. We can thus
use the following two cases for the integer n:
 The integer n is an even integer;

 The integer n is an odd integer.

Proposition 3: If n is an odd integer, then n2 C n is an even integer.

Some Common Situations to Use Cases
When using cases in a proof, the main rule is that the cases must be chosen so
that they exhaust all possibilities for an object x in the hypothesis of the original
proposition. Following are some common uses of cases in proofs.
When the hypothesis is,
‚Äún is an integer.‚Äù

Case 1: n is an even integer.
Case 2: n is an odd integer.

When the hypothesis is,
‚Äúm and n are integers.‚Äù

Case 1: m and n are even.
Case 2: m is even and n is odd.
Case 3: m is odd and n is even.
Case 4: m and n are both odd.

When the hypothesis is,
‚Äúx is a real number.‚Äù

Case 1: x is rational.
Case 2: x is irrational.

When the hypothesis is,
‚Äúx is a real number.‚Äù

Case 1: x D 0.
Case 2: x ¬§ 0.

OR

Case 1: x > 0.
Case 2: x D 0.
Case 3: x < 0.

Writing Guidelines for a Proof Using Cases
When writing a proof that uses cases, we use all the other writing guidelines. In
addition, we make sure that it is clear where each case begins. This can be done by
using a new paragraph with a label such as ‚ÄúCase 1,‚Äù or it can be done by starting
a paragraph with a phrase such as, ‚ÄúIn the case where . . . .‚Äù

Complete the proof of the following proposition:
Proposition. For each integer n, n2

5n C 7 is an odd integer.

Proof. Let n be an integer. We will prove that n2 5n C 7 is an odd integer by
examining the case where n is even and the case where n is odd.
Case 1. The integer n is even. In this case, there exists an integer m such that
n D 2m. Therefore, . . . .
As another example of using cases, consider a situation where we know that a and
b are real numbers and ab D 0. If we want to make a conclusion about b, the
temptation might be to divide both sides of the equation by a. However, we can
only do this if a ¬§ 0. So, we consider two cases: one when a D 0 and the other
when a ¬§ 0.
Proposition 3.22. For all real numbers a and b, if ab D 0, then a D 0 or b D 0.

Proof. We let a and b be real numbers and assume that ab D 0. We will prove
that a D 0 or b D 0 by considering two cases: (1) a D 0, and (2) a ¬§ 0.
In the case where a D 0, the conclusion of the proposition is true and so there
is nothing to prove.
In the case where a ¬§ 0, we can multiply both sides of the equation ab D 0

if ab D 0, then a D 0 or b D 0.

Absolute Value
Most students by now have studied the concept of the absolute value of a real
number. We use the notation jxj to stand for the absolute value of the real number
x. One way to think of the absolute value of x is as the ‚Äúdistance‚Äù between x and
0 on the number line. For example,
j5j D 5 and

j 7j D 7:

Although this notion of absolute value is convenient for determining the absolute
value of a specific number, if we want to prove properties about absolute value, we
need a more careful and precise definition.
Definition. For x 2 R, we define jxj, called the absolute value of x, by
(
x; if x  0;
jxj D
x if x < 0.

Let‚Äôs first see if this definition is consistent with our intuitive notion of absolute
value by looking at two specific examples.
 Since 5 > 0, we see that j5j D 5, which should be no surprise.
 Since 7 < 0, we see that j 7j D

. 7/ D 7.

Notice that the definition of the absolute value of x is given in two parts, one for
when x  0 and the other for when x < 0. This means that when attempting to
prove something about absolute value, we often uses cases. This will be illustrated
in Theorem 3.23.

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics

Theorem 3.23. Let a be a positive real number. For each real number x,
1. jxj D a if and only if x D a or x D a.
2. j xj D jxj.
Proof. The proof of Part (2) is part of Exercise (10). We will prove Part (1).
We let a be a positive real number and let x 2 R. We will first prove that if
jxj D a, then x D a or x D a. So we assume that jxj D a. In the case where
x  0, we see that jxj D x, and since jxj D a, we can conclude that x D a.
In the case where x < 0, we see that jxj D x. Since jxj D a, we can
conclude that x D a and hence that x D a. These two cases prove that if
jxj D a, then x D a or x D a.
We will now prove that if x D a or x D a, then jxj D a. We start by
assuming that x D a or x D a. Since the hypothesis of this conditional statement
is a disjunction, we use two cases. When x D a, we see that
jxj D jaj D a

since a > 0:

When x D a, we conclude that
jxj D j aj D

. a/

since

a < 0;

and hence, jxj D a. This proves that if x D a or x D a, then jxj D a. Because
we have proven both conditional statements, we have proven that jxj D a if and
only if x D a or x D a.

Theorem 3.25. Let a be a positive real number. For all real numbers x and y,
1. jxj < a if and only if a < x < a.
2. jxyj D jxj jyj.
3. jx C yj  jxj C jyj. This is known as the Triangle Inequality.
Proof. We will prove Part (1). The proof of Part (2) is included in Exercise (10),
and the proof of Part (3) is Exercise (14). For Part (1), we will prove the biconditional proposition by proving the two associated conditional propositions.
So we let a be a positive real number and let x 2 R and first assume that
jxj < a. We will use two cases: either x  0 or x < 0.
 In the case where x  0, we know that jxj D x and so the inequality jxj < a
implies that x < a. However, we also know that a < 0 and that x > 0.
Therefore, we conclude that a < x and, hence, a < x < a.
 When x < 0, we see that jxj D x. Therefore, the inequality jxj < a
implies that x < a, which in turn implies that a < x. In this case, we also
know that x < a since x is negative and a is positive. Hence, a < x < a
So in both cases, we have proven that a < x < a and this proves that if
jxj < a, then a < x < a. We now assume that a < x < a.
 If x  0, then jxj D x and hence, jxj < a.
 If x < 0, then jxj D x and so x D jxj. Thus, a < jxj. By
multiplying both sides of the last inequality by 1, we conclude that jxj < a.
These two cases prove that if a < x < a, then jxj < a. Hence, we have
proven that jxj < a if and only if a < x < a.

(a) Proposition. For all nonzero integers a and b, if a C 2b ¬§ 3 and
9a C 2b ¬§ 1, then the equation ax 3 C 2bx D 3 does not have a

Proof. We will prove the contrapositive, which is
For all nonzero integers a and b, if the equation ax 3 C2bx D 3 has
a solution that is a natural number, then aC2b D 3 or 9aC2b D 1.
So we let a and b be nonzero integers and assume that the natural
number n is a solution of the equation ax 3 C 2bx D 3. So we have

n an2 C b D 3:

or

So we can conclude that n D 3 and an2 C b D 1. Since we now have
the value of n, we can substitute it in the equation an3 C 2bn D 3 and
obtain 27a C 6b D 3. Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 shows
that 9a C 2b D 1. So there is no need for us to go any further, and this
concludes the proof of the contrapositive of the proposition.

(b) Proposition. For all nonzero integers a and b, if a C 2b ¬§ 3 and
9a C 2b ¬§ 1, then the equation ax 3 C 2bx D 3 does not have a

Proof. We will use a proof by contradiction. Let us assume that there
exist nonzero integers a and b such that a C 2b D 3 and 9a C 2b D 1
and an3 C 2bn D 3, where n is a natural number. First, we will solve
one equation for 2b; doing this, we obtain

When we substitute n D 1 into the equation an3 C2bn D 3, we obtain
a C 2b D 3. This is a contradiction since we are told in the proposition
that a C 2b ¬§ 3. This proves that the negation of the proposition is
false and, hence, the proposition is true.

The Division Algorithm
Preview Activity 1 was an introduction to a mathematical result known as the Division Algorithm. One of the purposes of this preview activity was to illustrate that
we have already worked with this result, perhaps without knowing its name. For
example, when we divide 337 by 6, we often write
337
1
D 56 C :
6
6
When we multiply both sides of this equation by 6, we get
337 D 6  56 C 1:
When we are working within the system of integers, the second equation is preferred over the first since the second one uses only integers and the operations of
addition and multiplication, and the integers are closed under addition and multiplication. Following is a complete statement of the Division Algorithm.
The Division Algorithm
For all integers a and b with b > 0, there exist unique integers q and r such
that
a D bq C r and 0  r < b:

144

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics

Some Comments about the Division Algorithm
1. The Division Algorithm can be proven, but we have not yet studied the methods that are usually used to do so. In this text, we will treat the Division Algorithm as an axiom of the integers. The work in Preview Activity 1 provides
some rationale that this is a reasonable axiom.
2. The statement of the Division Algorithm contains the new phrase, ‚Äúthere
exist unique integers q and r such that : : : :‚Äù This means that there is only
one pair of integers q and r that satisfy both the conditions a D bq C r and
0  r < b. As we saw in Preview Activity 1, there are several different ways
to write the integer a in the form a D bq C r. However, there is only one
way to do this and satisfy the additional condition that 0  r < b.
3. In light of the previous comment, when we speak of the quotient and the
remainder when we ‚Äúdivide an integer a by the positive integer b,‚Äù we will
always mean the quotient .q/ and the remainder .r/ guaranteed by the Division Algorithm. So the remainder r is the least nonnegative integer such that
there exists an integer (quotient) q with a D bq C r.
4. If a < 0, then we must be careful when writing the result of the Division
Algorithm. For example, in parts (4) and (5) of Preview Activity 1, with
a D 17 and b D 5, we obtained 17 D 5  . 4/ C 3, and so the quotient is
4 and the remainder is 3. Notice that this is different than the result from a
17
calculator, which would be
D 3:4. But this means
5

17

D
3C
D 3
:
5
10
5
If we multiply both sides of this equation by 5, we obtain
17 D 5 . 3/ C . 2/ :
This is not the result guaranteed by the Division Algorithm since the value
of 2 does not satisfy the result of being greater than or equal to 0 and less
than 5.
5. One way to look at the Division Algorithm is that the integer a is either going
to be a multiple of b, or it will lie between two multiples of b. Suppose that a
is not a multiple of b and that it lies between the multiples b q and b .q C 1/,
where q is some integer. This is shown on the number line in Figure 3.2.

D b:

Thus, in the case where a is not a multiple of b, we get 0 < r < b.
6. We have been implicitly using the fact that an integer cannot be both even and
odd. There are several ways to understand this fact, but one way is through
the Division Algorithm. When we classify an integer as even or odd, we are
doing so on the basis of the remainder (according to the Division Algorithm)
when the integer is ‚Äúdivided‚Äù by 2. If a 2 Z, then by the Division Algorithm
there exist unique integers q and r such that
a D 2q C r and 0  r < 2:
This means that the remainder, r, can only be zero or one (and not both).
When r D 0, the integer is even, and when r D 1, the integer is odd.

Using Cases Determined by the Division Algorithm
The Division Algorithm can sometimes be used to construct cases that can be used
to prove a statement that is true for all integers. We have done this when we divided
the integers into the even integers and the odd integers since even integers have a
remainder of 0 when divided by 2 and odd integers have a remainder of 1 when
divided by 2.
Sometimes it is more useful to divide the integer a by an integer other than 2.
For example, if a is divided by 3, there are three possible remainders: 0, 1, and
2. If a is divided by 4, there are four possible remainders: 0, 1, 2, and 3. The
remainders form the basis for the cases.
If the hypothesis of a proposition is that ‚Äún is an integer,‚Äù then we can use the
Division Algorithm to claim that there are unique integers q and r such that
n D 3q C r and 0  r < 3:
We can then divide the proof into the following three cases: (1) r D 0; (2) r D 1;
and (3) r D 2. This is done in Proposition 3.27.
Proposition 3.27. If n is an integer, then 3 divides n3

n.

Proof. Let n be an integer. We will show that 3 divides n3 n by examining the
three cases for the remainder when n is divided by 3. By the Division Algorithm,
there exist unique integers q and r such that
n D 3q C r, and 0  r < 3:
This means that we can consider the following three cases: (1) r D 0; (2) r D 1;
and (3) r D 2.
In the case where r D 0, we have n D 3q. By substituting this into the
expression n3 n, we get

The last case is when r D 2. The details for this case are part of Exercise (1).
Once this case is completed, we will have proved that 3 divides n3 n in all three
cases. Hence, we may conclude that if n is an integer, then 3 divides n3 n. 

Properties of Congruence
Most of the work we have done so far has involved using definitions to help prove
results. We will continue to prove some results but we will now prove some theorems about congruence (Theorem 3.28 and Theorem 3.30) that we will then use to
help prove other results.
Let n 2 N. Recall that if a and b are integers, then we say that a is congruent
to b modulo n provided that n divides a b, and we write a  b .mod n/. (See
Section 3.1.) We are now going to prove some properties of congruence that are
direct consequences of the definition. One of these properties was suggested by the
work in Preview Activity 2 and is Part (1) of the next theorem.
Theorem 3.28 (Properties of Congruence Modulo n). Let n be a natural number
and let a; b; c; and d be integers. If a  b .mod n/ and c  d .mod n/, then
1. .a C c/  .b C d / .mod n/.
2. ac  bd .mod n/.
3. For each m 2 N, am  b m .mod n/.
Proof. We will prove Parts (2) and (3). The proof of Part (1) is Progress Check 3.29.
Let n be a natural number and let a; b; c; and d be integers. Assume that a 
b .mod n/ and that c  d .mod n/. This means that n divides a b and that

148

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics

n divides c d . Hence, there exist integers k and q such that a b D nk and
c d D nq. We can then write a D b C nk and c D d C nq and obtain
ac D .b C nk/ .d C nq/

D bd C bnq C d nk C n2 kq

D bd C n .bq C d k C nkq/ :
By subtracting bd from both sides of the last equation, we see that
ac

bd D n .bq C d k C nkq/ :

Since bq C d k C nkq is an integer, this proves that n j .ac bd /, and hence we
can conclude that ac  bd .mod n/. This completes the proof of Part (2).
Part (2) basically means that if we have two congruences, we can multiply the
corresponding sides of these congruences to obtain another congruence. We have
assumed that a  b .mod n/ and so we write this twice as follows:
a  b .mod n/ ;

and

a  b .mod n/ :

If we now use the result in Part (2) and multiply the corresponding sides of these
two congruences, we obtain a2  b 2 .mod n/. We can then use this congruence
and the congruence a  b .mod n/ and the result in Part (2) to conclude that
a2  a  b 2  b .mod n/ ;
or that a3  b 3 .mod n/. We can say that we can continue with this process to
prove Part (3), but this is not considered to be a formal proof of this result. To
construct a formal proof for this, we could use a proof by mathematical induction.
This will be studied in Chapter 4. See Exercise (13) in Section 4.1.

Progress Check 3.29 (Proving Part (1) of Theorem 3.28)
Prove part (1) of Theorem 3.28.
Exercise (11) in Section 3.1 gave three important properties of congruence modulo
n. Because of their importance, these properties are stated and proved in Theorem 3.30. Please remember that textbook proofs are usually written in final form
of ‚Äúreporting the news.‚Äù Before reading these proofs, it might be instructive to first
try to construct a know-show table for each proof.
Theorem 3.30 (Properties of Congruence Modulo n). Let n 2 N,
and let a, b, and c be integers.

1. For every integer a, a  a .mod n/.
This is called the reflexive property of congruence modulo n.
2. If a  b .mod n/, then b  a .mod n/.
This is called the symmetric property of congruence modulo n.
3. If a  b .mod n/ and b  c .mod n/, then a  c .mod n/.
This is called the transitive property of congruence modulo n.
Proof. We will prove the reflexive property and the transitive property. The proof
of the symmetric property is Exercise (3).
Let n 2 N, and let a 2 Z. We will show that a  a .mod n/. Notice that
a

a D 0 D n  0:

This proves that n divides .a a/ and hence, by the definition of congruence
modulo n, we have proven that a  a .mod n/.
To prove the transitive property, we let n 2 N, and let a, b, and c be integers.
We assume that a  b .mod n/ and that b  c .mod n/. We will use the
definition of congruence modulo n to prove that a  c .mod n/. Since a 
b .mod n/ and b  c .mod n/, we know that n j .a b/ and n j .b c/. Hence,
there exist integers k and q such that
a
b

b D nk
c D nq:

By adding the corresponding sides of these two equations, we obtain
.a

b/ C .b

c/ D nk C nq:

If we simplify the left side of the last equation and factor the right side, we get
a

c D n .k C q/ :

By the closure property of the integers, .k C q/ 2 Z, and so this equation proves
that n j .a c/ and hence that a  c .mod n/. This completes the proof of the
transitive property of congruence modulo n.

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics

Using Cases Based on Congruence Modulo n
Notice that the set of all integers that are congruent to 2 modulo 7 is
fn 2 Z j n  2 .mod 7/g D f: : : ; 19; 12; 5; 2; 9; 16; 23; : : :g :
If we divide any integer in this set by 7 and write the result according to the Division
Algorithm, we will get a remainder of 2. For example,
2 D70C2

5 D 7 . 1/ C 2

9 D71C2

12 D 7 . 2/ C 2

16 D 7  2 C 2
23 D 7  3 C 2:

19 D 7 . 3/ C 2

Is this a coincidence or is this always true? Let‚Äôs look at the general case. For this,
let n be a natural number and let a 2 Z. By the Division Algorithm, there exist
unique integers q and r such that
a D nq C r and 0  r < n:
By subtracting r from both sides of the equation a D nq C r, we obtain
a
But this implies that n j .a
the following result.

r D nq:

r/ and hence that a  r .mod n/. We have proven

Theorem 3.31. Let n 2 N and let a 2 Z. If a D nq C r and 0  r < n for some
integers q and r, then a  r .mod n/.
This theorem says that an integer is congruent (mod n) to its remainder when it
is divided by n. Since this remainder is unique and since the only possible remainders for division by n are 0; 1; 2; : : : ; n 1, we can state the following result.
Corollary 3.32. If n 2 N, then each integer is congruent, modulo n, to precisely
one of the integers 0; 1; 2; : : : ; n 1. That is, for each integer a, there exists a
unique integer r such that
a  r .mod n/

and 0  r < n:

Corollary 3.32 can be used to set up cases for an integer in a proof. If n 2 N
and a 2 Z, then we can consider n cases for a. The integer a could be congruent to

0; 1; 2; : : : ; or n 1 modulo n. For example, if we assume that 5 does not divide an
integer a, then we know a is not congruent to 0 modulo 5, and hence, that a must
be congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5. We can use these as 4 cases within a proof.
For example, suppose we wish to determine the values of a2 modulo 5 for integers
that are not congruent to 0 modulo 5. We begin by squaring some integers that are
not congruent to 0 modulo 5. We see that

and

36  1 .mod 5/ :

and

64  4 .mod 5/ :

and

81  1 .mod 5/ :

These explorations indicate that the following proposition is true and we will now
outline a method to prove it.
Proposition 3.33. For each integer a, if a 6 0 .mod 5/, then a2  1 .mod 5/ or
a2  4 .mod 5/.
Proof . We will prove this proposition using cases for a based on congruence modulo 5. In doing so, we will use the results in Theorem 3.28 and Theorem 3.30.
Because the hypothesis is a 6 0 .mod 5/, we can use four cases, which are: (1)
a  1 .mod 5/, (2) a  2 .mod 5/, (3) a  3 .mod 5/, and (4) a  4 .mod 5/.
Following are proofs for the first and fourth cases.
Case 1. .a  1 .mod 5//. In this case, we use Theorem 3.28 to conclude that
a2  12 .mod 5/

or

a2  1 .mod 5/ :

This proves that if a  1 .mod 5/, then a2  1 .mod 5/.
Case 4. .a  4 .mod 5//. In this case, we use Theorem 3.28 to conclude that
a2  42 .mod 5/

or a2  16 .mod 5/ :

We also know that 16  1 .mod 5/. So we have a2  16 .mod 5/ and 16 
1 .mod 5/, and we can now use the transitive property of congruence (Theorem 3.30) to conclude that a2  1 .mod 5/. This proves that if a  4 .mod 5/,
then a2  1 .mod 5/.

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics

Progress Check 3.34 (Using Properties of Congruence)
Complete a proof of Proposition 3.33 by completing proofs for the other two cases.
Note: It is possible to prove Proposition 3.33 using only the definition of congruence instead of using the properties that we have proved about congruence. However, such a proof would involve a good deal of algebra. One of the advantages of
using the properties is that it avoids the use of complicated algebra in which it is
easy to make mistakes.
In the proof of Proposition 3.33, we used four cases. Sometimes it may seem
a bit overwhelming when confronted with a proof that requires several cases. For
example, if we want to prove something about some integers modulo 6, we may
have to use six cases. However, there are sometimes additional assumptions (or
conclusions) that can help reduce the number of cases that must be considered.
This will be illustrated in the next progress check.
Progress Check 3.35 (Using Cases Modulo 6)
Suppose we want to determine the possible values for a2 modulo 6 for odd integers
that are not multiples of 3. Before beginning to use congruence arithmetic (as in
the proof of Proposition 3.33) in each of the possible six cases, we can show that
some of the cases are not possible under these assumptions. (In some sense, we use
a short proof by contradiction for these cases.) So assume that a is an odd integer.
Then:
 If a  0 .mod 6/, then there exists an integer k such that a D 6k. But then
a D 2.3k/ and hence, a is even. Since we assumed that a is odd, this case
is not possible.
 If a  2 .mod 6/, then there exists an integer k such that a D 6k C 2. But
then a D 2.3k C 1/ and hence, a is even. Since we assumed that a is odd,
this case is not possible.
1. Prove that if a is an odd integer, then a cannot be congruent to 4 modulo 6.
2. Prove that if a is an integer and 3 does not divide a, then a cannot be congruent to 3 modulo 6.
3. So if a is an odd integer that is not a multiple of 3, then a must be congruent
to 1 or 5 modulo 6. Use these two cases to prove the following proposition:
Proposition 3.36. For each integer a, if a is an odd integer that is not multiple of
3, then a2  1 .mod 6/.

Proposition. Let a 2 Z. If 2 divides a and 3 divides a, then 6 divides a.

Proof : Let a 2 Z and assume that 2 divides a and 3 divides a. We will prove
that 6 divides a. Since 3 divides a, there exists an integer n such that
a D 3n:
The integer n is either even or it is odd. We will show that it must be even by

by the last two digits, the result will be an integer whose last two digits are

Review of Proof Methods

This section is different from others in the text. It is meant primarily as a review
of the proof methods studied in Chapter 3. So the first part of the section will be
a description of some of the main proof techniques introduced in Chapter 3. The
most important part of this section is the set of exercises since these exercises will
provide an opportunity to use the proof techniques that we have studied so far.
We will now give descriptions of three of the most common methods used to
prove a conditional statement.

Direct Proof of a Conditional Statement .P ! Q/
 When is it indicated? This type of proof is often used when the hypothesis
and the conclusion are both stated in a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù manner. That is, no negations are evident in the hypothesis and conclusion. That is, no negations are
evident in the hypothesis and conclusion.
 Description of the process. Assume that P is true and use this to conclude
that Q is true. That is, we use the forward-backward method and work
forward from P and backward from Q.
 Why the process makes sense. We know that the conditional statement
P ! Q is automatically true when the hypothesis is false. Therefore, because our goal is to prove that P ! Q is true, there is nothing to do in the
case that P is false. Consequently, we may assume that P is true. Then, in
order for P ! Q to be true, the conclusion Q must also be true. (When P
is true, but Q is false, P ! Q is false.) Thus, we must use our assumption
that P is true to show that Q is also true.

3.6. Review of Proof Methods

159

Proof of a Conditional Statement .P ! Q/ Using the Contrapositive
 When is it indicated? This type of proof is often used when both the hypothesis and the conclusion are stated in the form of negations. This often
works well if the conclusion contains the operator ‚Äúor‚Äù; that is, if the conclusion is in the form of a disjunction. In this case, the negation will be a
conjunction.
 Description of the process. We prove the logically equivalent statement p
:Q ! :P . The forward-backward method is used to prove :Q ! :P .
That is, we work forward from :Q and backward from :P .
 Why the process makes sense. When we prove :Q ! :P , we are also
proving P ! Q because these two statements are logically equivalent.
When we prove the contrapositive of P ! Q, we are doing a direct proof
of :Q ! :P . So we assume :Q because, when doing a direct proof, we
assume the hypothesis, and :Q is the hypothesis of the contrapositive. We
must show :P because it is the conclusion of the contrapositive.

Proof of .P ! Q/ Using a Proof by Contradiction
 When is it indicated? This type of proof is often used when the conclusion
is stated in the form of a negation, but the hypothesis is not. This often works
well if the conclusion contains the operator ‚Äúor‚Äù; that is, if the conclusion is
in the form of a disjunction. In this case, the negation will be a conjunction.
 Description of the process. Assume P and :Q and work forward from
these two assumptions until a contradiction is obtained.
 Why the process makes sense. The statement P ! Q is either true or
false. In a proof by contradiction, we show that it is true by eliminating the
only other possibility (that it is false). We show that P ! Q cannot be false
by assuming it is false and reaching a contradiction. Since we assume that
P ! Q is false, and the only way for a conditional statement to be false is
for its hypothesis to be true and its conclusion to be false, we assume that P
is true and that Q is false (or, equivalently, that :Q is true). When we reach
a contradiction, we know that our original assumption that P ! Q is false
is incorrect. Hence, P ! Q cannot be false, and so it must be true.

Chapter 3. Constructing and Writing Proofs in Mathematics

Other Methods of Proof
The methods of proof that were just described are three of the most common types
of proof. However, we have seen other methods of proof and these are described
below.

Proofs that Use a Logical Equivalency
As was indicated in Section 3.2, we can sometimes use of a logical equivalency to
help prove a statement. For example, in order to prove a statement of the form
P ! .Q _ R/ ;

(1)

it is sometimes possible to use the logical equivalency
≈íP ! .Q _ R/¬ç  ≈í.P ^ :Q/ ! R¬ç :
We would then prove the statement
.P ^ :Q/ ! R:

(2)

Most often, this would use a direct proof for statement (2) but other methods could
also be used. Because of the logical equivalency, by proving statement (2), we have
also proven the statement (1).

Proofs that Use Cases
When we are trying to prove a proposition or a theorem, we often run into the
problem that there does not seem to be enough information to proceed. In this
situation, we will sometimes use cases to provide additional assumptions for the
forward process of the proof. When this is done, the original proposition is divided
into a number of separate cases that are proven independently of each other. The
cases must be chosen so that they exhaust all possibilities for the hypothesis of
the original proposition. This method of case analysis is justified by the logical
equivalency
.P _ Q/ ! R  .P ! R/ ^ .Q ! R/ ;
which was established in Preview Activity 1 in Section 3.4.

3.6. Review of Proof Methods

161

Constructive Proof
This is a technique that is often used to prove a so-called existence theorem. The
objective of an existence theorem is to prove that a certain mathematical object
exists. That is, the goal is usually to prove a statement of the form
There exists an x such that P .x/.
For a constructive proof of such a proposition, we actually name, describe, or explain how to construct some object in the universe that makes P .x/ true.
Nonconstructive Proof
This is another type of proof that is often used to prove an existence theorem is
the so-called nonconstructive proof. For this type of proof, we make an argument
that an object in the universal set that makes P .x/ true must exist but we never

made by Christian Goldbach in a letter to Leonhard Euler in 1742. The
conjecture made in this letter is now known as Goldbach‚Äôs Conjecture. The

Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two
(not necessarily distinct) prime numbers.

Explorations and Activities
14. A Special Case of Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem. We have already seen examples
of Pythagorean triples, which are natural numbers a, b, and c where a2 C
b 2 D c 2 . For example, 3, 4, and 5 form a Pythagorean triple as do 5,
12, and 13. One of the famous mathematicians of the 17th century was
Pierre de Fermat (1601 ‚Äì 1665). Fermat made an assertion that for each
natural number n with n  3, there are no integers a, b, and c for which
an C b n D c n . This assertion was discovered in a margin of one of Fermat‚Äôs
books after his death, but Fermat provided no proof. He did, however, state
that he had discovered truly remarkable proof but the margin did not contain
enough room for the proof.
This assertion became known as Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem but it more properly should have been called Fermat‚Äôs Last Conjecture. Despite the efforts
of mathematicians, this ‚Äútheorem‚Äù remained unproved until Andrew Wiles, a
British mathematician, first announced a proof in June of 1993. However, it
was soon recognized that this proof had a serious gap, but a widely accepted
version of the proof was published by Wiles in 1995. Wiles‚Äô proof uses
many concepts and techniques that were unknown at the time of Fermat. We

cannot discuss the proof here, but we will explore and prove the following
proposition, which is a (very) special case of Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem.
Proposition. There do not exist prime numbers a, b,and c such that
a3 C b 3 D c 3 .

Although Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem implies this proposition is true, we will use
a proof by contradiction to prove this proposition. For a proof by contradiction, we assume that
there exist prime numbers a, b,and c such that a3 C b 3 D c 3 .
Since 2 is the only even prime number, we will use the following cases: (1)
a D b D 2; (2) a and b are both odd; and (3) one of a and b is odd and the
other one is 2.
(a) Show that the case where a D b D 2 leads to a contradiction and
hence, this case is not possible.
(b) Show that the case where a and b are both odd leads to a contradiction
and hence, this case is not possible.
(c) We now know that one of a or b must be equal to 2. So we assume that
b D 2 and that a is an odd prime. Substitute b D 2 into the equation
b 3 D c 3 a3 and then factor the expression c 3 a3 . Use this to obtain
a contradiction.
(d) Write a complete proof of the proposition.

15. The purpose of this exploration is to investigate the possibilities for which
integers cannot be the sum of the cubes of two or three integers.
(a) If x is an integer, what are the possible values (between 0 and 8, inclusive) for x 3 modulo 9?
(b) If x and y are integers, what are the possible values for x 3 C y 3 (between 0 and 8, inclusive) modulo 9?
(c) If k is an integer and k  3 .mod 9/, can k be equal to the sum of the
cubes of two integers? Explain.
(d) If k is an integer and k  4 .mod 9/, can k be equal to the sum of the
cubes of two integers? Explain.
(e) State and prove a theorem of the following form: For each integer k,
if (conditions on k), then k cannot be written as the sum of the cubes
of two integers. Be as complete with the conditions on k as possible
based on the explorations in Part (b).

Note: Andrew Booker, a mathematician at the University of Bristol in the
United Kingdom, recently discovered that 33 can be written as the sum of
the cubes of three integers. Booker used a trio of 16-digit integers, two of
which were negative. Following is a link to an article about this discovery.

Mathematical Induction

The Principle of Mathematical Induction

Preview Activity 1 (Exploring Statements of the Form .8n 2 N/ .P.n//)
One of the most fundamental sets in mathematics is the set of natural numbers
N. In this section, we will learn a new proof technique, called mathematical induction, that is often used to prove statements of the form .8n 2 N/ .P .n//. In
Section 4.2, we will learn how to extend this method to statements of the form
.8n 2 T / .P .n//, where T is a certain type of subset of the integers Z.
For each natural number n, let P .n/ be the following open sentence:

4 divides 5n 1 :

1. Does this open sentence become a true statement when n D 1? That is, is 1
in the truth set of P .n/?
2. Does this open sentence become a true statement when n D 2? That is, is 2
in the truth set of P .n/?
3. Choose at least four more natural numbers and determine whether the open
sentence is true or false for each of your choices.

All of the examples that were used should provide evidence that the following
proposition is true:
For each natural number n, 4 divides .5n
169

1/.

170

Chapter 4. Mathematical Induction

We should keep in mind that no matter how many examples we try, we cannot
prove this proposition with a list of examples because we can never check if 4
divides .5n 1/ for every natural number n. Mathematical induction will provide
a method for proving this proposition.
For another example, for each natural number n, we now let Q.n/ be the following open sentence:
12 C 22 C    C n2 D

n.n C 1/.2n C 1/
:
6

(1)

The expression on the left side of the previous equation is the sum of the squares
of the first n natural numbers. So when n D 1, the left side of equation (1) is 12 .
When n D 2, the left side of equation (1) is 12 C 22 .
4. Does Q.n/ become a true statement when
 n D 1? (Is 1 in the truth set of Q.n/?)
 n D 2? (Is 2 in the truth set of Q.n/?)
 n D 3? (Is 3 in the truth set of Q.n/?)
5. Choose at least four more natural numbers and determine whether the open
sentence is true or false for each of your choices. A table with the columns
n.n C 1/.2n C 1/
may help you organize your
n, 12 C 22 C    C n2 , and
6
work.
All of the examples we have explored, should indicate the following proposition is
true:
For each natural number n, 12 C 22 C    C n2 D

n.n C 1/.2n C 1/
.

In this section, we will learn how to use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
Preview Activity 2 (A Property of the Natural Numbers)
Intuitively, the natural numbers begin with the number 1, and then there is 2, then 3,
then 4, and so on. Does this process of ‚Äústarting with 1‚Äù and ‚Äúadding 1 repeatedly‚Äù
result in all the natural numbers? We will use the concept of an inductive set to
explore this idea in this activity.

4.1. The Principle of Mathematical Induction

171

Definition. A set T that is a subset of Z is an inductive set provided that for
each integer k, if k 2 T , then k C 1 2 T .
1. Carefully explain what it means to say that a subset T of the integers Z is
not an inductive set. This description should use an existential quantifier.
2. Use the definition of an inductive set to determine which of the following
sets are inductive sets and which are not. Do not worry about formal proofs,
but if a set is not inductive, be sure to provide a specific counterexample that
proves it is not inductive.

(f) The set of integers, Z
(g) The set of odd natural numbers.

3. This part will explore one of the underlying mathematical ideas for a proof
by induction. Assume that T  N and assume that 1 2 T and that T is an
inductive set. Use the definition of an inductive set to answer each of the
following:
(a) Is 2 2 T ? Explain.
(b) Is 3 2 T ? Explain.
(c) Is 4 2 T ? Explain.

(d) Is 100 2 T ? Explain.

(e) Do you think that T D N? Explain.

Inductive Sets
The two open sentences in Preview Activity 1 appeared to be true for all values of
n in the set of natural numbers, N. That is, the examples in this preview activity
provided evidence that the following two statements are true.
 For each natural number n, 4 divides .5n

1/.

 For each natural number n, 12 C 22 C    C n2 D

n.n C 1/.2n C 1/
.
6

One way of proving statements of this form uses the concept of an inductive set
introduced in Preview Activity 2. The idea is to prove that if one natural number

172

Chapter 4. Mathematical Induction

makes the open sentence true, then the next one also makes the open sentence
true. This is how we handle the phrase ‚Äúand so on‚Äù when dealing with the natural
numbers. In Preview Activity 2, we saw that the number systems N and Z and
other sets are inductive. What we are trying to do is somehow distinguish N from
the other inductive sets. The way to do this was suggested in Part (3) of Preview
Activity 2. Although we will not prove it, the following statement should seem
true.
Statement 1: For each subset T of N, if 1 2 T and T is inductive, then T D N.
Notice that the integers, Z, and the set S D fn 2 Z j n  3g both contain 1 and
both are inductive, but they both contain numbers other than natural numbers. For
example, the following statement is false:
Statement 2: For each subset T of Z, if 1 2 T and T is inductive, then T D Z.
The set S D fn 2 Z j n  3g D f 3; 2; 1; 0; 1; 2; 3; : : : g is a counterexample
that shows that this statement is false.
Progress Check 4.1 (Inductive Sets)
Suppose that T is an inductive subset of the integers. Which of the following
statements are true, which are false, and for which ones is it not possible to tell?
1. 1 2 T and 5 2 T.
2. If 1 2 T , then 5 2 T.
3. If 5 ‚Ä¶ T, then 2 ‚Ä¶ T.
4. For each integer k, if k 2 T, then
k C7 2 T.
5. For each integer k, k ‚Ä¶ T or

k C1 2 T.
6. There exists an integer k such that
k 2 T and k C 1 ‚Ä¶ T.
7. For each integer k, if k C 1 2 T,
then k 2 T.
8. For each integer k, if k C 1 ‚Ä¶ T,
then k ‚Ä¶ T.

The Principle of Mathematical Induction
Although we proved that Statement (2) is false, in this text, we will not prove
that Statement (1) is true. One reason for this is that we really do not have a
formal definition of the natural numbers. However, we should be convinced that

4.1. The Principle of Mathematical Induction

173

Statement (1) is true. We resolve this by making Statement (1) an axiom for the
natural numbers so that this becomes one of the defining characteristics of the
natural numbers.
The Principle of Mathematical Induction
If T is a subset of N such that
1. 1 2 T, and
2. For every k 2 N, if k 2 T, then .k C 1/ 2 T,
then T D N.

Using the Principle of Mathematical Induction
The primary use of the Principle of Mathematical Induction is to prove statements
of the form
.8n 2 N/ .P .n// ;
where P .n/ is some open sentence. Recall that a universally quantified statement
like the preceding one is true if and only if the truth set T of the open sentence
P .n/ is the set N. So our goal is to prove that T D N, which is the conclusion of
the Principle of Mathematical Induction. To verify the hypothesis of the Principle
of Mathematical Induction, we must

1. Prove that 1 2 T. That is, prove that P .1/ is true.
2. Prove that if k 2 T, then .k C 1/ 2 T. That is, prove that if P .k/ is true,
then P .k C 1/ is true.
The first step is called the basis step or the initial step, and the second step is
called the inductive step. This means that a proof by mathematical induction will
have the following form:

174

Chapter 4. Mathematical Induction

Procedure for a Proof by Mathematical Induction
To prove: .8n 2 N/ .P .n//
Basis step:
Inductive step:

Prove P .1/.
Prove that for each k 2 N,
if P .k/ is true, then P .k C 1/ is true.

We can then conclude that P .n/ is true for all n 2 N.
Note that in the inductive step, we want to prove that the conditional statement ‚Äúfor
each k 2 N, if P .k/ then P .k C 1/‚Äù is true. So we will start the inductive step by
assuming that P .k/ is true. This assumption is called the inductive assumption
or the inductive hypothesis.
The key to constructing a proof by induction is to discover how P .k C 1/ is
related to P .k/ for an arbitrary natural number k. For example, in Preview Activity 1, one of the open sentences P .n/ was
12 C 22 C    C n2 D

n.n C 1/.2n C 1/
:
6

Sometimes it helps to look at some specific examples such as P .2/ and P .3/. The
idea is not just to do the computations, but to see how the statements are related.
This can sometimes be done by writing the details instead of immediately doing
computations.

In this case, the key is the left side of each equation. The left side of P .3/ is
obtained from the left side of P .2/ by adding one term, which is 32 . This suggests
that we might be able to obtain the equation for P .3/ by adding 32 to both sides of
the equation in P .2/. Now for the general case, if k 2 N, we look at P .k C 1/ and
compare it to P .k/.

4.1. The Principle of Mathematical Induction

175

The key is to look at the left side of the equation for P .k C 1/ and realize what this
notation means. It means that we are adding the squares of the first .k C 1/ natural
numbers. This means that we can write
12 C 22 C    C .k C 1/2 D 12 C 22 C    C k 2 C .k C 1/2 :
This shows us that the left side of the equation for P .k C 1/ can be obtained from
the left side of the equation for P .k/ by adding .k C 1/2 . This is the motivation
for proving the inductive step in the following proof.
Proposition 4.2. For each natural number n,
12 C 22 C    C n2 D

Proof. We will use a proof by mathematical induction. For each natural number

which proves that P .1/ is true.
For the inductive step, we prove that for each k 2 N, if P .k/ is true, then P .k C 1/
is true. So let k be a natural number and assume that P .k/ is true. That is, assume
that

Writing Guideline
The proof of Proposition 4.2 shows a standard way to write an induction proof.
When writing a proof by mathematical induction, we should follow the guideline
that we always keep the reader informed. This means that at the beginning of the
proof, we should state that a proof by induction will be used. We should then
clearly define the open sentence P .n/ that will be used in the proof.

Summation Notation
The result in Proposition 4.2 could be written using summation notation as follows:

For each natural number n,

n
P

j D1

j2 D

n.n C 1/.2n C 1/
.

4.1. The Principle of Mathematical Induction

In this case, we use j for the index for the summation, and the notation
us to add all the values of j 2 for j from 1 to n, inclusive. That is,
n

j 2 tells

Some Comments about Mathematical Induction
1. The basis step is an essential part of a proof by induction. See Exercise (19)
for an example that shows that the basis step is needed in a proof by induction.
2. Exercise (20) provides an example that shows the inductive step is also an
essential part of a proof by mathematical induction.

178

Chapter 4. Mathematical Induction

3. It is important to remember that the inductive step in an induction proof is
a proof of a conditional statement. Although we did not explicitly use the
forward-backward process in the inductive step for Proposition 4.2, it was
implicitly used in the discussion prior to Proposition 4.2. The key question
was, ‚ÄúHow does knowing the sum of the first k squares help us find the sum
of the first .k C 1/ squares?‚Äù
4. When proving the inductive step in a proof by induction, the key question is,
How does knowing P .k/ help us prove P .k C 1/?
In Proposition 4.2, we were able to see that the way to answer this question
was to add a certain expression to both sides of the equation given in P .k/.
Sometimes the relationship between P .k/ and P .k C 1/ is not as easy to see.
For example, in Preview Activity 1, we explored the following proposition:
For each natural number n, 4 divides .5n

1/.

n
This means that the open sentence, P .n/, is ‚Äú4 divides
 .5 1/.‚Äù So in the
inductive step, we assume k 2 N and that 4 divides 5k 1 . This means
that there exists an integer m such that

5k

(1)

1 D 4m:



In the backward process, the goal is to prove that 4 divides 5kC1 1 . This
can be accomplished if we can prove that there exists an integer s such that
5kC1

(2)

1 D 4s:

We now need to see if there is anything in equation (1) that can be used in
equation (2). The key is to find something in the equation 5k 1 D 4m that
is related to something similar in the equation 5kC1 1 D 4s. In this case,
we notice that
5kC1 D 5  5k :
So if we can solve 5k 1 D 4m for 5k , we could make a substitution for 5k .
This is done in the proof of the following proposition.
Proposition 4.4. For every natural number n, 4 divides .5n

1/.

4.1. The Principle of Mathematical Induction

179

Proof. (Proof by Mathematical Induction) For each natural number n, let P .n/ be
‚Äú4 divides .5n 1/.‚Äù We first prove that P .1/ is true. Notice that when n D 1,
.5n 1/ D 4. Since 4 divides 4, P .1/ is true.
For the inductive step, we prove that for all k 2 N, if P .k/ is true, then
P .k C 1/ is true. So let k be a natural number and assume that P .k/ is true. That
is, assume that


4 divides 5k 1 :
This means that there exists an integer m such that
5k

1 D 4m:

Thus,
5k D 4m C 1:



In order to prove that P .k C 1/ is true, we must show that 4 divides 5kC1
Since 5kC1 D 5  5k , we can write

5kC1

1 D 5  5k

(1)

1 .
(2)

We now substitute the expression for 5k from equation (1) into equation (2). This
gives
5kC1

D 5.4m C 1/

D .20m C 5/
D 20m C 4

1
1

D 4.5m C 1/

(3)



Since .5m C 1/ is an integer, equation (3) shows that 4 divides 5kC1 1 . Therefore, if P .k/ is true, then P .k C 1/ is true and the inductive step has been established. Thus, by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, for every natural number
n, 4 divides .5n 1/.

Proposition 4.4 was stated in terms of ‚Äúdivides.‚Äù We can use congruence to state
a proposition that is equivalent to Proposition 4.4. The idea is that the sentence,
4 divides .5n 1/ means that 5n  1 .mod 4/. So the following proposition is
equivalent to Proposition 4.4.
Proposition 4.5. For every natural number n, 5n  1 .mod 4/.

180

Chapter 4. Mathematical Induction

Since we have proved Proposition 4.4, we have in effect proved Proposition 4.5.
However, we could have proved Proposition 4.5 first by using the results in Theorem 3.28 on page 147. This will be done in the next progress check.
Progress Check 4.6 (Proof of Proposition 4.5) .
To prove Proposition 4.5, we let P .n/ be 5n  1 .mod 4/ and notice that P .1/ is
true since 5  1 .mod 4/. For the inductive step, let k be a natural number and
assume that P .k/ is true. That is, assume that 5k  1 .mod 4/.
1. What must be proved in order to prove that P .k C 1/ is true?
2. Since 5kC1 D 5  5k , multiply both sides of the congruence 5k  1 .mod 4/
by 5. The results in Theorem 3.28 on page 147 justify this step.
3. Now complete the proof that for each k 2 N, if P .k/ is true, then P .k C 1/
is true and complete the induction proof of Proposition 4.5.
It might be nice to compare the proofs of Propositions 4.4 and 4.5 and decide which
one is easier to understand.

where P .n/ is an open sentence. This means that we are proving that every statement in the following infinite list is true.
P .1/; P .2/; P .3/; : : :

(2)

The inductive step in a proof by induction is to prove that if one statement in this
infinite list of statements is true, then the next statement in the list must be true.
Now imagine that each statement in (2) is a domino in a chain of dominoes. When
we prove the inductive step, we are proving that if one domino is knocked over,
then it will knock over the next one in the chain. Even if the dominoes are set up
so that when one falls, the next one will fall, no dominoes will fall unless we start
by knocking one over. This is why we need the basis step in an induction proof.
The basis step guarantees that we knock over the first domino. The inductive step,
then, guarantees that all dominoes after the first one will also fall.
Now think about what would happen if instead of knocking over the first domino,
we knock over the sixth domino. If we also prove the inductive step, then we would
know that every domino after the sixth domino would also fall. This is the idea of
the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction. It is not necessary for the basis
step to be the proof that P .1/ is true. We can make the basis step be the proof that
P .M / is true, where M is some natural number. The Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction can be generalized somewhat by allowing M to be any integer.
We are still only concerned with those integers that are greater than or equal to M.
The Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction
Let M be an integer. If T is a subset of Z such that
1. M 2 T, and
2. For every k 2 Z with k  M, if k 2 T, then .k C 1/ 2 T,
then T contains all integers greater than or equal to M.
fn 2 Z j n  M g  T.

That is,

Using the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction
The primary use of the Principle of Mathematical Induction is to prove statements
of the form
.8n 2 Z; with n  M / .P .n//;
where M is an integer and P .n/ is some open sentence. (In most induction proofs,
we will use a value of M that is greater than or equal to zero.) So our goal is to

4.2. Other Forms of Mathematical Induction

191

prove that the truth set T of the predicate P .n/ contains all integers greater than or
equal to M. So to verify the hypothesis of the Extended Principle of Mathematical
Induction, we must
1. Prove that M 2 T. That is, prove that P .M / is true.
2. Prove that for every k 2 Z with k  M, if k 2 T, then .k C 1/ 2 T. That is,
prove that if P .k/ is true, then P .k C 1/ is true.
As before, the first step is called the basis step or the initial step, and the second step is called the inductive step. This means that a proof using the Extended
Principle of Mathematical Induction will have the following form:
Using the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction
Let M be an integer. To prove: .8n 2 Z with n  M / .P .n//
Basis step:
Inductive step:

Prove P .M /.
Prove that for every k 2 Z with k  M,
if P .k/ is true, then P .k C 1/ is true.

We can then conclude that P .n/ is true for all n 2 Z with n  M.
This is basically the same procedure as the one for using the Principle of Mathematical Induction. The only difference is that the basis step uses an integer M
other than 1. For this reason, when we write a proof that uses the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction, we often simply say we are going to use a proof by
mathematical induction. We will use the work from Preview Activity 1 to illustrate
such a proof.
Proposition 4.7. For each natural number n with n  4, n≈† > 2n .
Proof. We will use a proof by mathematical induction. For this proof, we let
P .n/ be ‚Äún≈† > 2n.‚Äù
We first prove that P .4/ is true. Using n D 4, we see that 4≈† D 24 and 24 D 16.
This means that 4≈† > 24 and, hence, P .4/ is true.
For the inductive step, we prove that for all k 2 N with k  4, if P .k/ is true,
then P .k C 1/ is true. So let k be a natural number greater than or equal to 4, and
assume that P .k/ is true. That is, assume that
k≈† > 2k :

(1)

192

Chapter 4. Mathematical Induction

The goal is to prove that P .k C 1/ is true or that .k C 1/≈† > 2kC1 . Multiplying
both sides of inequality (1) by k C 1 gives
.k C 1/  k≈† > .k C 1/  2k ; or
.k C 1/≈† > .k C 1/  2k :

(2)

Now, k  4. Thus, k C 1 > 2, and hence .k C 1/  2k > 2  2k . This means that
.k C 1/  2k > 2kC1 :

(3)

Inequalities (2) and (3) show that
.k C 1/≈† > 2kC1 ;
and this proves that if P .k/ is true, then P .k C 1/ is true. Thus, the inductive step
has been established, and so by the Extended Principle of Mathematical Induction,
n≈† > 2n for each natural number n with n  4.

The Second Principle of Mathematical Induction
Let P .n/ be
n is a prime number or n is a product of prime numbers.
(This is related to the work in Preview Activity 2.)
Suppose we would like to use induction to prove that P .n/ is true for all natural
numbers greater than 1. We have seen that the idea of the inductive step in a proof

4.2. Other Forms of Mathematical Induction

193

by induction is to prove that if one statement in an infinite list of statements is true,
then the next statement must also be true. The problem here is that when we factor
a composite number, we do not get to the previous case. For example, if assume
that P .39/ is true and we want to prove that P .40/ is true, we could factor 40 as
40 D 2  20. However, the assumption that P .39/ is true does not help us prove
that P .40/ is true.
This work is intended to show the need for another principle of induction. In
the inductive step of a proof by induction, we assume one statement is true and
prove the next one is true. The idea of this new principle is to assume that all of the
previous statements are true and use this assumption to prove the next statement is
true. This is stated formally in terms of subsets of natural numbers in the Second
Principle of Mathematical Induction. Rather than stating this principle in two versions, we will state the extended version of the Second Principle. In many cases,
we will use M D 1 or M D 0.
The Second Principle of Mathematical Induction
Let M be an integer. If T is a subset of Z such that
1. M 2 T, and
2. For every k 2 Z with k  M, if fM; M C 1; : : : ; kg  T, then
.k C 1/ 2 T,
then T contains all integers greater than or equal to M.
fn 2 Z j n  M g  T.

That is,

Using the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction
The primary use of mathematical induction is to prove statements of the form
.8n 2 Z; with n  M / .P .n// ;
where M is an integer and P .n/ is some predicate. So our goal is to prove that the
truth set T of the predicate P .n/ contains all integers greater than or equal to M .
To use the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, we must
1. Prove that M 2 T. That is, prove that P .M / is true.
2. Prove that for every k 2 N, if k  M and fM; M C 1; : : : ; kg  T, then
.k C 1/ 2 T. That is, prove that if P .M /; P .M C 1/; : : : ; P .k/ are true,
then P .k C 1/ is true.

194

Chapter 4. Mathematical Induction

As before, the first step is called the basis step or the initial step, and the
second step is called the inductive step. This means that a proof using the Second
Principle of Mathematical Induction will have the following form:
Using the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction
Let M be an integer. To prove: .8n 2 Z with n  M / .P .n//
Basis step:
Inductive step:

Prove P .M /.
Let k 2 Z with k  M . Prove that if
P .M /; P .M C 1/; : : : ; P .k/ are true, then
P .k C 1/ is true.

We can then conclude that P .n/ is true for all n 2 Z with n  M.
We will use this procedure to prove the proposition suggested in Preview Activity 2.
Theorem 4.9. Each natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or is
a product of prime numbers.
Proof. We will use the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction. We let P .n/
be
n is either a prime number or n is a product of prime numbers.
For the basis step, P .2/ is true since 2 is a prime number.
To prove the inductive step, we let k be a natural number with k  2. We assume
that P .2/; P .3/; : : : ; P .k/ are true. That is, we assume that each of the natural
numbers 2; 3; : : : ; k is a prime number or a product of prime numbers. The goal
is to prove that P .k C 1/ is true or that .k C 1/ is a prime number or a product of
prime numbers.
Case 1: If .k C 1/ is a prime number, then P .k C 1/ is true.
Case 2: If .k C 1/ is not a prime number, then .k C 1/ can be factored into a
product of natural numbers with each one being less than .k C 1/. That is, there
exist natural numbers a and b with
k C 1 D a  b;

and 1 < a  k and 1 < b  k:

4.2. Other Forms of Mathematical Induction

195

Using the inductive assumption, this means that P .a/ and P .b/ are both true.
Consequently, a and b are prime numbers or are products of prime numbers. Since
k C 1 D a  b, we conclude that .k C 1/ is a product of prime numbers. That is,
we conclude that P .k C 1/ is true. This proves the inductive step.
Hence, by the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, we conclude that
P .n/ is true for all n 2 N with n  2, and this means that each natural number
greater than 1 is either a prime number or is a product of prime numbers.

We will conclude this section with a progress check that is really more of an
activity. We do this rather than including the activity at the end of the exercises
since this activity illustrates a use of the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction in which it is convenient to have the basis step consist of the proof of more
than one statement.
Progress Check 4.10 (Using the Second Principle of Induction)
Consider the following question:
For which natural numbers n do there exist nonnegative integers x and y
such that n D 3x C 5y?
To help answer this question, we will let Z D fx 2 Z j x  0g, and let P .n/ be
There exist x; y 2 Z such that n D 3x C 5y.
Notice that P .1/ is false since if both x and y are zero, then 3x C 5y D 0 and
if either x > 0 or y > 0, then 3x C 5y  3. Also notice that P .6/ is true since
6 D 3  2 C 5  0 and P .8/ is true since 8 D 3  1 C 5  1.

true.
2. Explain why P .9/, P .10/, P .11/, and P .12/ are true.
We could continue trying to determine other values of n for which P .n/ is true.
However, let us see if we can use the work in part (2) to determine if P .13/ is true.
Notice that 13 D 3 C 10 and we know that P .10/ is true. We should be able to use
this to prove that P .13/ is true. This is formalized in the next part.

Multiplying both sides of this inequality by 2, we see that 2kC1 >

Induction and Recursion

Preview Activity 1 (Recursively Defined Sequences)
In a proof by mathematical induction, we ‚Äústart with a first step‚Äù and then prove
that we can always go from one step to the next step. We can use this same idea to
define a sequence as well. We can think of a sequence as an infinite list of numbers
that are indexed by the natural numbers (or some infinite subset of N [ f0g). We
often write a sequence in the following form:
a1 ; a2 ; : : : ; an ; : : : :
The number an is called the nth term of the sequence. One way to define a sequence is to give a specific formula for the nth term of the sequence such as
1
an D .
n
Another way to define a sequence is to give a specific definition of the first term
(or the first few terms) and then state, in general terms, how to determine anC1 in
terms of n and the first n terms a1 ; a2 ; : : : ; an. This process is known as definition
by recursion and is also called a recursive definition. The specific definition of
the first term is called the initial condition, and the general definition of anC1 in
terms of n and the first n terms a1 ; a2 ; : : : ; an is called the recurrence relation.
(When more than one term is defined explicitly, we say that these are the initial
conditions.) For example, we can define a sequence recursively as follows:
1
b1 D 16, and for each n 2 N, bnC1 D bn .

The Fibonacci Numbers
The Fibonacci numbers form a famous sequence in mathematics that was investigated by Leonardo of Pisa (1170 ‚Äì 1250), who is better known as Fibonacci.
Fibonacci introduced this sequence to the Western world as a solution of the following problem:
Suppose that a pair of adult rabbits (one male, one female) produces a pair
of rabbits (one male, one female) each month. Also, suppose that newborn
rabbits become adults in two months and produce another pair of rabbits.
Starting with one adult pair of rabbits, how many pairs of rabbits will be
produced each month for one year?
Since we start with one adult pair, there will be one pair produced the first
month, and since there is still only one adult pair, one pair will also be produced in
the second month (since the new pair produced in the first month is not yet mature).
In the third month, two pairs will be produced, one by the original pair and one by
the pair which was produced in the first month. In the fourth month, three pairs
will be produced, and in the fifth month, five pairs will be produced.
The basic rule is that in a given month after the first two months, the number of
adult pairs is the number of adult pairs one month ago plus the number of pairs born
two months ago. This is summarized in Table 4.1, where the number of pairs produced is equal to the number of adult pairs, and the number of adult pairs follows
the Fibonacci sequence of numbers that we developed in Preview Activity 2.

Table 4.1: Fibonacci Numbers
Historically, it is interesting to note that Indian mathematicians were studying
these types of numerical sequences well before Fibonacci. In particular, about fifty
years before Fibonacci introduced his sequence, Acharya Hemachandra (1089 ‚Äì
1173) considered the following problem, which is from the biography of Hemachandra in the MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive at http://www-groups.dcs.stand.ac.uk/ history/Biographies/Hemachandra.html.

Chapter 4. Mathematical Induction
Suppose we assume that lines are composed of syllables which are either
short or long. Suppose also that each long syllable takes twice as long to
articulate as a short syllable. A line of length n contains n units where each
short syllable is one unit and each long syllable is two units. Clearly a line
of length n units takes the same time to articulate regardless of how it is
composed. Hemchandra asks: How many different combinations of short
and long syllables are possible in a line of length n?

This is an important problem in the Sanskrit language since Sanskrit meters are
based on duration rather than on accent as in the English Language. The answer
to this question generates a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Suppose
that hn is the number of patterns of syllables of length n. We then see that h1 D 1
and h2 D 2. Now let n be a natural number and consider pattern of length n C 2.
This pattern either ends in a short syllable or a long syllable. If it ends in a short
syllable and this syllable is removed, then there is a pattern of length n C 1, and
there are hnC1 such patterns. Similarly, if it ends in a long syllable and this syllable
is removed, then there is a pattern of length n, and there are hn such patterns. From
this, we conclude that
hnC2 D hnC1 C hn :
This actually generates the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . . . For more information
about Hemachandra, see the article Math for Poets and Drummers by Rachel Wells
Hall in the February 2008 issue of Math Horizons.
We will continue to use the Fibonacci sequence in this book. This sequence
may not seem all that important or interesting. However, it turns out that this sequence occurs in nature frequently and has applications in computer science. There
is even a scholarly journal, The Fibonacci Quarterly, devoted to the Fibonacci
numbers.
The sequence of Fibonacci numbers is one of the most studied sequences in
mathematics, due mainly to the many beautiful patterns it contains. Perhaps one
observation you made in Preview Activity 2 is that every third Fibonacci number
is even. This can be written as a proposition as follows:
For each natural number n; f3n is an even natural number:
As with many propositions associated with definitions by recursion, we can prove
this using mathematical induction. The first step is to define the appropriate open
sentence. For this, we can let P .n/ be, ‚Äúf3n is an even natural number.‚Äù
Notice that P .1/ is true since f3 D 2. We now need to prove the inductive
step. To do this, we need to prove that for each k 2 N,

4.3. Induction and Recursion

205

if P .k/ is true, then P .k C 1/ is true.
That is, we need to prove that for each k 2 N, if f3k is even, then f3.kC1/ is even.
So let‚Äôs analyze this conditional statement using a know-show table.

The key question now is, ‚ÄúIs there any relation between f3.kC1/ and f3k ?‚Äù We
can use the recursion formula that defines the Fibonacci sequence to find such a
relation.
The recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence states that a Fibonacci number (except for the first two) is equal to the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers. If we write 3 .k C 1/ D 3k C 3, then we get f3.kC1/ D f3kC3 . For f3kC3 ,
the two previous Fibonacci numbers are f3kC2 and f3kC1 . This means that
f3kC3 D f3kC2 C f3kC1:
Using this and continuing to use the Fibonacci relation, we obtain the following:
f3.kC1/ D f3kC3

D f3kC2 C f3kC1

D .f3kC1 C f3k / C f3kC1 :
The preceding equation states that f3.kC1/ D 2f3kC1 C f3k . This equation
can be used to complete the proof of the induction step.
Progress Check 4.12 (Every Third Fibonacci Number Is Even)
Complete the proof of Proposition 4.13.
Proposition 4.13. For each natural number n, the Fibonacci number f3n is an
even natural number.
Hint: We have already defined the predicate P .n/ to be used in an induction proof
and have proved the basis step. Use the information in and after the preceding
know-show table to help prove that if f3k is even, then f3.kC1/ is even.

Geometric Sequences and Geometric Series
Let a; r 2 R. The following sequence was introduced in Preview Activity 1.
Initial condition:
Recurrence relation:

a1 D a.
For each n 2 N, anC1 D r  an .

This is a recursive definition for a geometric sequence with initial term a and
(common) ratio r. The basic idea is that the next term in the sequence is obtained
by multiplying the previous term by the ratio r. The work in Preview Activity 1
suggests that the following proposition is true.
Theorem 4.14. Let a; r 2 R. If a geometric sequence is defined by a1 D a and
for each n 2 N, anC1 D r  an , then for each n 2 N, an D a  r n 1 .
The proof of this proposition is Exercise (6).
Another sequence that was introduced in Preview Activity 1 is related to geometric series and is defined as follows:
Initial condition: S1 D a.
Recurrence relation: For each n 2 N, SnC1 D a C r  Sn .

For each n 2 N, the term Sn is a (finite) geometric series with initial term a and
(common) ratio r. The work in Preview Activity 1 suggests that the following
proposition is true.
Theorem 4.15. Let a; r 2 R. If the sequence S1 ; S2 ; : : : ; Sn; : : : is defined by
S1 D a and for each n 2 N, SnC1 D a C r  Sn , then for each n 2 N, Sn D
a C a  r C a  r 2 C    C a  r n 1 . That is, the geometric series Sn is the sum of
the first n terms of the corresponding geometric sequence.
The proof of Proposition 4.15 is Exercise (7). The recursive definition of a
geometric series and Proposition 4.15 give two different ways to look at geometric
series. Proposition 4.15 represents a geometric series as the sum of the first n
terms of the corresponding geometric sequence. Another way to determine the
sum a geometric series is given in Theorem 4.16, which gives a formula for the
sum of a geometric series that does not use a summation.
Theorem 4.16. Let a; r 2 R and r ¬§ 1. If the sequence S1 ; S2 ; : : : ; Sn; : : : is
defined by
a and for each n 2 N, SnC1 D a C r  Sn , then for each n 2 N,

Sets and Operations on Sets

Preview Activity 1 (Set Operations)
Before beginning this section, it would be a good idea to review sets and set notation, including the roster method and set builder notation, in Section 2.3.
In Section 2.1, we used logical operators (conjunction, disjunction, negation)
to form new statements from existing statements. In a similar manner, there are
several ways to create new sets from sets that have already been defined. In fact,
we will form these new sets using the logical operators of conjunction (and), disjunction (or), and negation (not). For example, if the universal set is the set of
natural numbers N and
A D f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g

and

B D f1; 3; 5; 7; 9g;

 The set consisting of all natural numbers that are in A and are in B is the set
f1; 3; 5g;
 The set consisting of all natural numbers that are in A or are in B is the set
f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 9g; and
 The set consisting of all natural numbers that are in A and are not in B is the
set f2; 4; 6g.
These sets are examples of some of the most common set operations, which are
given in the following definitions.

A B and read ‚ÄúA minus B‚Äù or ‚Äúthe complement of B with respect to A,‚Äù is
the set of all elements in A that are not in B. That is,
A

B D fx 2 U j x 2 A and x ‚Ä¶ Bg:

The complement of the set A, written Ac and read ‚Äúthe complement of A,‚Äù
is the set of all elements of U that are not in A. That is,
Ac D fx 2 U j x ‚Ä¶ Ag:
For the rest of this preview activity, the universal set is U D f0; 1; 2; 3; : : : ; 10g,
and we will use the following subsets of U :
A D f0; 1; 2; 3; 9g

and

B D f2; 3; 4; 5; 6g.

So in this case, A \ B D fx 2 U j x 2 A and x 2 Bg D f2; 3g. Use the roster
method to specify each of the following subsets of U .
1. A [ B

2. Ac

3. B c

We can now use these sets to form even more sets. For example,
A \ B c D f0; 1; 2; 3; 9g \ f0; 1; 7; 8; 9; 10g D f0; 1; 9g:
Use the roster method to specify each of the following subsets of U .

Preview Activity 2 (Venn Diagrams for Two Sets)
In Preview Activity 1, we worked with verbal and symbolic definitions of set operations. However, it is also helpful to have a visual representation of sets. Venn
diagrams are used to represent sets by circles (or some other closed geometric
shape) drawn inside a rectangle. The points inside the rectangle represent the universal set U , and the elements of a set are represented by the points inside the
circle that represents the set. For example, Figure 5.1 is a Venn diagram showing
two sets.

In Figure 5.1, the elements of A are represented by the points inside the left circle,
and the elements of B are represented by the points inside the right circle. The four
distinct regions in the diagram are numbered for reference purposes only. (The
numbers do not represent elements in a set.) The following table describes the four
regions in the diagram.

Set Equality, Subsets, and Proper Subsets
In Section 2.3, we introduced some basic definitions used in set theory, what it
means to say that two sets are equal and what it means to say that one set is a
subset of another set. See the definitions on page 55. We need one more definition.
Definition. Let A and B be two sets contained in some universal set U . The
set A is a proper subset of B provided that A  B and A ¬§ B. When A is a
proper subset of B, we write A  B.
One reason for the definition of proper subset is that each set is a subset of
itself. That is,
If A is a set, then A  A.
However, sometimes we need to indicate that a set X is a subset of Y but X ¬§ Y .
For example, if
X D f1; 2g and Y D f0; 1; 2; 3g;

5.1. Sets and Operations on Sets

219

then X  Y . We know that X  Y since each element of X is an element of Y ,
but X ¬§ Y since 0 2 Y and 0 ‚Ä¶ X . (Also, 3 2 Y and 3 ‚Ä¶ X .) Notice that the
notations A  B and A  B are used in a manner similar to inequality notation
for numbers (a < b and a  b).
It is often very important to be able to describe precisely what it means to say
that one set is not a subset of the other. In the preceding example, Y is not a subset
of X since there exists an element of Y (namely, 0) that is not in X .
In general, the subset relation is described with the use of a universal quantifier
since A  B means that for each element x of U , if x 2 A, then x 2 B. So when
we negate this, we use an existential quantifier as follows:
AB

means

.8x 2 U / ≈í.x 2 A/ ! .x 2 B/¬ç.

A 6 B

means

: .8x 2 U / ≈í.x 2 A/ ! .x 2 B/¬ç
.9x 2 U / : ≈í.x 2 A/ ! .x 2 B/¬ç
.9x 2 U / ≈í.x 2 A/ ^ .x ‚Ä¶ B/¬ç.

So we see that A 6 B means that there exists an x in U such that x 2 A and
x ‚Ä¶ B.
Notice that if A D ;, then the conditional statement, ‚ÄúFor each x 2 U , if x 2 ;,
then x 2 B‚Äù must be true since the hypothesis will always be false. Another way
to look at this is to consider the following statement:
; 6 B means that there exists an x 2 ; such that x ‚Ä¶ B.
However, this statement must be false since there does not exist an x in ;. Since
this is false, we must conclude that ;  B. Although the facts that ;  B and
B  B may not seem very important, we will use these facts later, and hence we
summarize them in Theorem 5.1.
Theorem 5.1. For any set B, ;  B and B  B.
In Section 2.3, we also defined two sets to be equal when they have precisely
the same elements. For example,
Àö
x 2 R j x 2 D 4 D f 2; 2g:

If the two sets A and B are equal, then it must be true that every element of A is
an element of B, that is, A  B, and it must be true that every element of B is

220

Chapter 5. Set Theory

an element of A, that is, B  A. Conversely, if A  B and B  A, then A and
B must have precisely the same elements. This gives us the following test for set
equality:
Theorem 5.2. Let A and B be subsets of some universal set U. Then A D B if
and only if A  B and B  A.

More about Venn Diagrams
In Preview Activity 2, we learned how to use Venn diagrams as a visual representation for sets, set operations, and set relationships. In that preview activity, we
restricted ourselves to using two sets. We can, of course, include more than two
sets in a Venn diagram. Figure 5.3 shows a general Venn diagram for three sets
(including a shaded region that corresponds to A \ C ).
In this diagram, there are eight distinct regions, and each region has a unique
reference number. For example, the set A is represented by the combination of regions 1, 2, 4, and 5, whereas the set C is represented by the combination of regions
4, 5, 6, and 7. This means that the set A \ C is represented by the combination of
regions 4 and 5. This is shown as the shaded region in Figure 5.3.
Finally, Venn diagrams can also be used to illustrate special relationships between sets. For example, if A  B, then the circle representing A should be
completely contained in the circle for B. So if A  B, and we know nothing about

The Power Set of a Set
The symbol 2 is used to describe a relationship between an element of the universal set and a subset of the universal set, and the symbol  is used to describe a
relationship between two subsets of the universal set. For example, the number 5
is an integer, and so it is appropriate to write 5 2 Z. It is not appropriate, however,
to write 5  Z since 5 is not a set. It is important to distinguish between 5 and
f5g. The difference is that 5 is an integer and f5g is a set consisting of one element. Consequently, it is appropriate to write f5g  Z, but it is not appropriate to
write f5g 2 Z. The distinction between these two symbols .5 and f5g/ is important
when we discuss what is called the power set of a given set.
Definition. If A is a subset of a universal set U , then the set whose members
are all the subsets of A is called the power set of A. We denote the power set
of A by P.A/ . Symbolically, we write
P.A/ D fX  U j X  Ag :
That is, X 2 P.A/ if and only if X  A.
When dealing with the power set of A, we must always remember that ;  A
and A  A. For example, if A D fa; bg, then the subsets of A are
;; fag; fbg; fa; bg:

(1)

We can write this as
P.A/ D f;; fag; fbg; fa; bgg:
Now let B D fa; b; cg. Notice that B D A [ fcg. We can determine the subsets
of B by starting with the subsets of A in (1). We can form the other subsets of B
by taking the union of each set in (1) with the set fcg. This gives us the following
subsets of B.
fcg; fa; cg; fb; cg; fa; b; cg:
(2)
So the subsets of B are those sets in (1) combined with those sets in (2). That is,
the subsets of B are
;; fag; fbg; fa; bg ; fcg; fa; cg; fb; cg; fa; b; cg;

(3)

5.1. Sets and Operations on Sets

223

which means that
P.B/ D f;; fag; fbg; fa; bg; fcg; fa; cg; fb; cg; fa; b; cgg:
Notice that we could write
fa; cg  B or that fa; cg 2 P.B/:
Also, notice that A has two elements and A has four subsets, and B has three elements and B has eight subsets. Now, let n be a nonnegative integer. The following
result can be proved using mathematical induction. (See Exercise 17).)
Theorem 5.5. Let n be a nonnegative integer and let T be a subset of some universal set. If the set T has n elements, then the power set of T has 2n subsets. That
is, P.T / has 2n elements.

The Cardinality of a Finite Set
In our discussion of the power set, we were concerned with the number of elements in a set. In fact, the number of elements in a finite set is a distinguishing
characteristic of the set, so we give it the following name.
Definition. The number of elements in a finite set A is called the cardinality
of A and is denoted by card .A/.
For example, card .;/ D 0;

card .fa; bg/ D 2;

card .P.fa; bg// D 4.

Theoretical Note: There is a mathematical way to distinguish between finite and
infinite sets, and there is a way to define the cardinality of an infinite set. We will
not concern ourselves with this at this time. More about the cardinality of finite
and infinite sets is discussed in Chapter 9.

Standard Number Systems
We can use set notation to specify and help describe our standard number systems.
The starting point is the set of natural numbers, for which we use the roster
method.
N D f1; 2; 3; 4; : : : g

224

Chapter 5. Set Theory

The integers consist of the natural numbers, the negatives of the natural numbers,
and zero. If we let N D f: : : ; 4; 3; 2; 1g, then we can use set union and
write
Z D N [ f0g [ N:

So we see that N  Z, and in fact, N  Z.

We need to use set builder notation for the set Q of all rational numbers,
which consists of quotients of integers.
n mÀá
o
Àá
QD
Àá m; n 2 Z and n ¬§ 0
n

Since any integer n can be written as n D , we see that Z  Q.
1
We do not yet have the tools to give a complete description of the real numbers.
We will simply say that the real numbers consist of the rational numbers and the
irrational numbers. In effect, the irrational numbers are the complement of the
set of rational numbers Q in R. So we can use the notation Qc D fx 2 R j x ‚Ä¶ Qg
and write
R D Q [ Qc
and
Q \ Qc D ;:
A number system that we have not yet discussed is the set of complex numbers.
The complex

17. Proof of Theorem 5.5. To help with the proof by induction of Theorem 5.5,
we first prove the following lemma. (The idea for the proof of this lemma
was illustrated with the discussion of power set after the definition on page 222.)
Lemma 5.6. Let A and B be subsets of some universal set. If A D B [ fxg,
where x ‚Ä¶ B, then any subset of A is either a subset of B or a set of the form
C [ fxg, where C is a subset of B.
Proof. Let A and B be subsets of some universal set, and assume that A D
B [ fxg where x ‚Ä¶ B. Let Y be a subset of A. We need to show that Y is a
subset of B or that Y D C [ fxg, where C is some subset of B. There are
two cases to consider: (1) x is not an element of Y, and (2) x is an element
of Y.
Case 1: Assume that x ‚Ä¶ Y. Let y 2 Y . Then y 2 A and y ¬§ x. Since
A D B [ fxg;

230

Chapter 5. Set Theory
this means that y must be in B. Therefore, Y  B.
Case 2: Assume that x 2 Y. In this case, let C D Y fxg. Then every
element of C is an element of B. Hence, we can conclude that C  B and
that Y D C [ fxg.
Cases (1) and (2) show that if Y  A, then Y  B or Y D C [ fxg, where
C  B.

To begin the induction proof of Theorem 5.5, for each nonnegative integer
n, we let P .n/ be, ‚ÄúIf a finite set has exactly n elements, then that set has
exactly 2n subsets.‚Äù
(a) Verify that P .0/ is true. (This is the basis step for the induction proof.)
(b) Verify that P .1/ and P .2/ are true.
(c) Now assume that k is a nonnegative integer and assume that P .k/is
true. That is, assume that if a set has k elements, then that set has 2k
subsets. (This is the inductive assumption for the induction proof.)
Let T be a subset of the universal set with card .T / D k C 1, and let
x 2 T . Then the set B D T fxg has k elements.
Now use the inductive assumption to determine how many subsets B
has. Then use Lemma 5.6 to prove that T has twice as many subsets
as B. This should help complete the inductive step for the induction
proof.

Complete the know-show table in Table 5.1 for the proposition that S is a

This table is in the form of a proof method called the choose-an-element
method. This method is frequently used when we encounter a universal
quantifier in a statement in the backward process. (In this case, this is Step
Q1.) The key is that we have to prove something about all elements in Z.
We can then add something to the forward process by choosing an arbitrary
element from the set S . (This is done in Step P1.) This does not mean that
we can choose a specific element of S . Rather, we must give the arbitrary
element a name and use only the properties it has by being a member of the
set S . In this case, the element is a multiple of 6.

2. Draw a general Venn diagram for two sets, A and B. First determine the
region that corresponds to the set A B and then, on the Venn diagram, shade

Explain.
In this section, we will learn how to prove certain relationships about sets. Two
of the most basic types of relationships between sets are the equality relation and
the subset relation. So if we are asked a question of the form, ‚ÄúHow are the sets A
and B related?‚Äù, we can answer the question if we can prove that the two sets are
equal or that one set is a subset of the other set. There are other ways to answer this,
but we will concentrate on these two for now. This is similar to asking a question
about how two real numbers are related. Two real numbers can be related by the
fact that they are equal or by the fact that one number is less than the other number.

The Choose-an-Element Method
The method of proof we will use in this section can be called the choose-anelement method. This method was introduced in Preview Activity 1. This method
is frequently used when we encounter a universal quantifier in a statement in the
backward process. This statement often has the form
For each element with a given property, something happens.
Since most statements with a universal quantifier can be expressed in the form of a
conditional statement, this statement could have the following equivalent form:
If an element has a given property, then something happens.
We will illustrate this with the proposition from Preview Activity 1. This proposition can be stated as follows:

5.2. Proving Set Relationships

233

Let S be the set of all integers that are multiples of 6, and let T be the set of
all even integers. Then S is a subset of T.
In Preview Activity 1, we worked on a know-show table for this proposition. The
key was that in the backward process, we encountered the following statement:
Each element of S is an element of T or, more precisely, if x 2 S, then
x 2 T.
In this case, the ‚Äúelement‚Äù is an integer, the ‚Äúgiven property‚Äù is that it is an element of S , and the ‚Äúsomething that happens‚Äù is that the element is also an element
of T . One way to approach this is to create a list of all elements with the given
property and verify that for each one, the ‚Äúsomething happens.‚Äù When the list is
short, this may be a reasonable approach. However, as in this case, when the list is
infinite (or even just plain long), this approach is not practical.
We overcome this difficulty by using the choose-an-element method, where
we choose an arbitrary element with the given property. So in this case, we choose
an integer x that is a multiple of 6. We cannot use a specific multiple of 6 (such as
12 or 24), but rather the only thing we can assume is that the integer satisfies the
property that it is a multiple of 6. This is the key part of this method.
Whenever we choose an arbitrary element with a given property,
we are not selecting a specific element. Rather, the only thing we
can assume about the element is the given property.
It is important to realize that once we have chosen the arbitrary element, we have
added information to the forward process. So in the know-show table for this
proposition, we added the statement, ‚ÄúLet x 2 S ‚Äù to the forward process. Following is a completed proof of this proposition following the outline of the know-show
table from Preview Activity 1.
Proposition 5.7. Let S be the set of all integers that are multiples of 6, and let T be
the set of all even integers. Then S is a subset of T.
Proof. Let S be the set of all integers that are multiples of 6, and let T be the set
of all even integers. We will show that S is a subset of T by showing that if an
integer x is an element of S , then it is also an element of T .
Let x 2 S . (Note: The use of the word ‚Äúlet‚Äù is often an indication that the we
are choosing an arbitrary element.) This means that x is a multiple of 6. Therefore,

234

Chapter 5. Set Theory

there exists an integer m such that
x D 6m:
Since 6 D 2  3, this equation can be written in the form
x D 2.3m/:
By closure properties of the integers, 3m is an integer. Hence, this last equation
proves that x must be even. Therefore, we have shown that if x is an element of S ,
then x is an element of T , and hence that S  T .

Having proved that S is a subset of T , we can now ask if S is actually equal to
T . The work we did in Preview Activity 1 can help us answer this question. In that
preview activity, we should have found several elements that are in T but not in S .
For example, the integer 2 is in T since 2 is even but 2 ‚Ä¶ S since 2 is not a multiple
of 6. Therefore, S ¬§ T and we can also conclude that S is a proper subset of T .
One reason we do this in a ‚Äútwo-step‚Äù process is that it is much easier to work
with the subset relation than the proper subset relation. The subset relation is defined by a conditional statement and most of our work in mathematics deals with
proving conditional statements. In addition, the proper subset relation is a conjunction of two statements (S  T and S ¬§ T ) and so it is natural to deal with the two
parts of the conjunction separately.

Proving Set Equality
One way to prove that two sets are equal is to use Theorem 5.2 and prove each of
the two sets is a subset of the other set. In particular, let A and B be subsets of some
universal set. Theorem 5.2 states that A D B if and only if A  B and B  A.
In Preview Activity 2, we created a Venn diagram that indicated that
A .A B/ D A \ B. Following is a proof of this result. Notice where the
choose-an-element method is used in each case.
Proposition 5.11. Let A and B be subsets of some universal set.
A .A B/ D A \ B.

Then

Proof. Let A and B be subsets of some universal set. We will prove that
A .A B/ D A \ B by proving that A .A B/  A \ B and that
A \ B  A .A B/.
First, let x 2 A

.A

B/. This means that
x 2 A and x ‚Ä¶ .A

B/:

We know that an element is in .A B/ if and only if it is in A and not in B. Since
x ‚Ä¶ .A B/, we conclude that x ‚Ä¶ A or x 2 B. However, we also know that
x 2 A and so we conclude that x 2 B. This proves that
x 2 A and x 2 B:
This means that x 2 A \ B, and hence we have proved that A

.A

B/  A \ B.

236

Chapter 5. Set Theory
Now choose y 2 A \ B. This means that
y 2 A and y 2 B:

We note that y 2 .A B/ if and only if y 2 A and y ‚Ä¶ B and hence, y ‚Ä¶ .A B/
if and only if y ‚Ä¶ A or y 2 B. Since we have proved that y 2 B, we conclude that
y ‚Ä¶ .A B/, and hence, we have established that y 2 A and y ‚Ä¶ .A B/. This
proves that if y 2 A \ B, then y 2 A .A B/ and hence, A \ B  A .A B/.
Since we have proved that A .A B/  A \ B and A \ B  A
we conclude that A .A B/ D A \ B.

Disjoint Sets
Earlier in this section, we discussed the concept of set equality and the relation
of one set being a subset of another set. There are other possible relationships
between two sets; one is that the sets are disjoint. Basically, two sets are disjoint if
and only if they have nothing in common. We express this formally in the following
definition.
Definition. Let A and B be subsets of the universal set U . The sets A and B
are said to be disjoint provided that A \ B D ;.
For example, the Venn diagram in Figure 5.5 shows two sets A and B with
A  B. The shaded region is the region that represents B c . From the Venn
diagram, it appears that A \ B c D ;. This means that A and B c are disjoint. The
preceding example suggests that the following proposition is true:
If A  B, then A \ B c D ;.
If we would like to prove this proposition, a reasonable ‚Äúbackward question‚Äù is,
‚ÄúHow do we prove that a set .namely A \ B c / is equal to the empty set?‚Äù

Figure 5.5: Venn Diagram with A  B
This question seems difficult to answer since how do we prove that a set is
empty? This is an instance where proving the contrapositive or using a proof by
contradiction could be reasonable approaches. To illustrate these methods, let us
assume the proposition we are trying to prove is of the following form:
If P , then T D ;.
If we choose to prove the contrapositive or use a proof by contradiction, we will
assume that T ¬§ ;. These methods can be outlined as follows:
 The contrapositive of ‚ÄúIf P , then T D ;‚Äù is, ‚ÄúIf T ¬§ ;, then :P .‚Äù So in
this case, we would assume T ¬§ ; and try to prove :P .
 Using a proof by contradiction, we would assume P and assume that T ¬§ ;.
From these two assumptions, we would attempt to derive a contradiction.
One advantage of these methods is that when we assume that T ¬§ ;, then we know
that there exists an element in the set T . We can then use that element in the rest of
the proof. We will prove one of the conditional statements for Proposition 5.14 by
proving its contrapositive. The proof of the other conditional statement associated
with Proposition 5.14 is Exercise (10).
Proposition 5.14. Let A and B be subsets of some universal set. Then A  B if
and only if A \ B c D ;.
Proof. Let A and B be subsets of some universal set. We will first prove that if
A  B, then A \ B c D ;, by proving its contrapositive. That is, we will prove

238

Chapter 5. Set Theory
If A \ B c ¬§ ;, then A 6 B.

So assume that A \ B c ¬§ ;. We will prove that A 6 B by proving that there must
exist an element x such that x 2 A and x ‚Ä¶ B.
that

Since A \ B c ¬§ ;, there exists an element x that is in A \ B c . This means
x 2 A and x 2 B c :

Now, the fact that x 2 B c means that x ‚Ä¶ B. Hence, we can conclude that
x 2 A and x ‚Ä¶ B:
This means that A 6 B, and hence, we have proved that if A \ B c ¬§ ;, then
A 6 B, and therefore, we have proved that if A  B, then A \ B c D ;.
The proof that if A \ B c D ;, then A  B is Exercise (10).

Progress Check 5.15 (Proving Two Sets Are Disjoint)
It has been noted that it is often possible to prove that two sets are disjoint by
using a proof by contradiction. In this case, we assume that the two sets are not
disjoint and hence, their intersection is not empty. Use this method to prove that
the following two sets are disjoint.

A Final Comment
We have used the choose-an-element method to prove Propositions 5.7, 5.11,
and 5.14. Proofs involving sets that use this method are sometimes referred to as
element-chasing proofs. This name is used since the basic method is to choose an
arbitrary element from one set and ‚Äúchase it‚Äù until you prove it must be in another
set.

6. To prove the following set equalities, it may be necessary to use some of

necessary to use the facts that:

 The product of two real numbers is positive if and only if the two real
numbers are either both positive or are both negative.
 The product of two real numbers is negative if and only if one of the
two numbers is positive and the other is negative.
For example, if x .x 2/ < 0, then we can conclude that either (1) x < 0
and x 2 > 0 or (2) x > 0 and x 2 < 0. However, in the first case, we
must have x < 0 and x > 2, and this is impossible. Therefore, we conclude
that x > 0 and x 2 < 0, which means that 0 < x < 2.

Proof. We assume that A, B, and C be subsets of some universal set
and that A 6 B and B 6 C . This means that there exists an element x
in A that is not in B and there exists an element x that is in B and not in
C . Therefore, x 2 A and x ‚Ä¶ C , and we have proved that A 6 C . 
(b) Let A, B, and C be subsets of some universal set. If A \ B D A \ C ,

Proof. We assume that A \ B D A \ C and will prove that B D C .
We will first prove that B  C .
So let x 2 B. If x 2 A, then x 2 A \ B, and hence, x 2 A \ C .
From this we can conclude that x 2 C . If x ‚Ä¶ A, then x ‚Ä¶ A \ B,
and hence, x ‚Ä¶ A \ C . However, since x ‚Ä¶ A, we may conclude that
x 2 C . Therefore, B  C .
The proof that C  B may be done in a similar manner. Hence, B D

Explorations and Activities
18. Using the Choose-an-Element Method in a Different Setting. We have
used the choose-an-element method to prove results about sets. This method,
however, is a general proof technique and can be used in settings other than
set theory. It is often used whenever we encounter a universal quantifier in a
statement in the backward process. Consider the following proposition.
Proposition 5.16. Let a, b, and t be integers with t ¬§ 0. If t divides a and t
divides b, then for all integers x and y, t divides (ax + by).
(a) Whenever we encounter a new proposition, it is a good idea to explore the proposition by looking at specific examples. For example, let
a D 20, b D 12, and t D 4. In this case, t j a and t j b. In each of the
following cases, determine the value of .ax C by/ and determine if t
divides .ax C by/.
i. x D 1; y D 1
ii. x D 1; y D 1
iii. x D 2; y D 2
(b) Repeat Part (18a) with a D 21, b D

iv. x D 2; y D 3
v. x D 2; y D 3
vi. x D 2; y D 5
6, and t D 3.

Notice that the conclusion of the conditional statement in this proposition
involves the universal quantifier. So in the backward process, we would
have
Q: For all integers x and y, t divides ax C by.
The ‚Äúelements‚Äù in this sentence are the integers x and y. In this case, these
integers have no ‚Äúgiven property‚Äù other than that they are integers. The
‚Äúsomething that happens‚Äù is that t divides .ax C by/. This means that in the
forward process, we can use the hypothesis of the proposition and choose
integers x and y. That is, in the forward process, we could have
P : a, b, and t are integers with t ¬§ 0, t divides a and t divides b.
P1: Let x 2 Z and let y 2 Z.
(c) Complete the following proof of Proposition 5.16.

244

Chapter 5. Set Theory
Proof. Let a, b, and t be integers with t ¬§ 0, and assume that t divides
a and t divides b. We will prove that for all integers x and y, t divides

such that : : : :

Properties of Set Operations

Preview Activity 1 (Exploring a Relationship between Two Sets)
Let A and B be subsets of some universal set U .
1. Draw two general Venn diagrams for the sets A and B. On one, shade the
region that represents .A [ B/c , and on the other, shade the region that represents Ac \ B c . Explain carefully how you determined these regions.

between the sets .A [ B/c and Ac \ B c ?
Some of the properties of set operations are closely related to some of the logical
operators we studied in Section 2.1. This is due to the fact that set intersection is
defined using a conjunction (and), and set union is defined using a disjunction (or).
For example, if A and B are subsets of some universal set U , then an element x is
in A [ B if and only if x 2 A or x 2 B.

Algebra of Sets ‚Äì Part 1
This section contains many results concerning the properties of the set operations.
We have already proved some of the results. Others will be proved in this section or
in the exercises. The primary purpose of this section is to have in one place many
of the properties of set operations that we may use in later proofs. These results
are part of what is known as the algebra of sets or as set theory.
Theorem 5.17. Let A, B, and C be subsets of some universal set U . Then
 A \ B  A and A  A [ B.
 If A  B, then A \ C  B \ C and A [ C  B [ C .
Proof. The first part of this theorem was included in Exercise (7) from Section 5.2.
The second part of the theorem was Exercise (12) from Section 5.2.

The next theorem provides many of the properties of set operations dealing
with intersection and union. Many of these results may be intuitively obvious, but
to be complete in the development of set theory, we should prove all of them. We
choose to prove only some of them and leave some as exercises.

Chapter 5. Set Theory

Theorem 5.18 (Algebra of Set Operations). Let A, B, and C be subsets of some
universal set U . Then all of the following equalities hold.

and the Universal Set

A\U DA

Distributive Laws

A \ .B [ C / D .A \ B/ [ .A \ C /
A [ .B \ C / D .A [ B/ \ .A [ C /

Before proving some of these properties, we note that in Section 5.2, we learned
that we can prove that two sets are equal by proving that each one is a subset of the
other one. However, we also know that if S and T are both subsets of a universal
set U , then
S D T if and only if for each x 2 U , x 2 S if and only if x 2 T .
We can use this to prove that two sets are equal by choosing an element from
one set and chasing the element to the other set through a sequence of ‚Äúif and only
if‚Äù statements. We now use this idea to prove one of the commutative laws.

Proof of One of the Commutative Laws in Theorem 5.18
Proof. We will prove that A \ B D B \ A. Let x 2 A \ B. Then
x 2 A \ B if and only if x 2 A and x 2 B:

(1)

However, we know that if P and Q are statements, then P ^ Q is logically equivalent to Q ^ P . Consequently, we can conclude that
x 2 A and x 2 B if and only if x 2 B and x 2 A:

(2)

Now we know that
x 2 B and x 2 A if and only if x 2 B \ A:

(3)

This means that we can use (1), (2), and (3) to conclude that
x 2 A \ B if and only if x 2 B \ A;
and, hence, we have proved that A \ B D B \ A.

Progress Check 5.19 (Exploring a Distributive Property)
We can use Venn diagrams to explore the more complicated properties in Theorem 5.18, such as the associative and distributive laws. To that end, let A, B, and
C be subsets of some universal set U .
1. Draw two general Venn diagrams for the sets A, B, and C . On one, shade
the region that represents A [ .B \ C /, and on the other, shade the region
that represents .A [ B/ \ .A [ C /. Explain carefully how you determined
these regions.
2. Based on the Venn diagrams in Part (1), what appears to be the relationship
between the sets A [ .B \ C / and .A [ B/ \ .A [ C /?

Proof of One of the Distributive Laws in Theorem 5.18
We will now prove the distributive law explored in Progress Check 5.19. Notice
that we will prove two subset relations, and that for each subset relation, we will
begin by choosing an arbitrary element from a set. Also notice how nicely a proof
dealing with the union of two sets can be broken into cases.
Proof. Let A, B, and C be subsets of some universal set U . We will prove that
A [ .B \ C / D .A [ B/ \ .A [ C / by proving that each set is a subset of the
other set.
We will first prove that A [ .B \ C /  .A [ B/ \ .A [ C /.
x 2 A [ .B \ C /. Then x 2 A or x 2 B \ C .

We let

So in one case, if x 2 A, then x 2 A [ B and x 2 A [ C . This means that
x 2 .A [ B/ \ .A [ C /.
On the other hand, if x 2 B \ C , then x 2 B and x 2 C . But x 2 B
implies that x 2 A [ B, and x 2 C implies that x 2 A [ C . Since x is in both
sets, we conclude that x 2 .A [ B/ \ .A [ C /. So in both cases, we see that
x 2 .A [ B/ \ .A [ C /, and this proves that A [ .B \ C /  .A [ B/ \ .A [ C /.
We next prove that .A [ B/ \ .A [ C /  A [ .B \ C /.
So let
y 2 .A [ B/ \ .A [ C /. Then, y 2 A [ B and y 2 A [ C . We must prove
that y 2 A [ .B \ C /. We will consider the two cases where y 2 A or y ‚Ä¶ A. In
the case where y 2 A, we see that y 2 A [ .B \ C /.
So we consider the case that y ‚Ä¶ A. It has been established that y 2 A [ B and
y 2 A [ C . Since y ‚Ä¶ A and y 2 A [ B, y must be an element of B. Similarly,

248

Chapter 5. Set Theory

since y ‚Ä¶ A and y 2 A [ C , y must be an element of C . Thus, y 2 B \ C and,
hence, y 2 A [ .B \ C /.
In both cases, we have proved that y 2 A [ .B \ C /. This proves that
.A [ B/\.A [ C /  A[.B \ C /. The two subset relations establish the equality
of the two sets. Thus, A [ .B \ C / D .A [ B/ \ .A [ C /.

Important Properties of Set Complements
The three main set operations are union, intersection, and complementation. Theorems 5.18 and 5.17 deal with properties of unions and intersections. The next
theorem states some basic properties of complements and the important relations
dealing with complements of unions and complements of intersections. Two relationships in the next theorem are known as De Morgan‚Äôs Laws for sets and are
closely related to De Morgan‚Äôs Laws for statements.
Theorem 5.20. Let A and B be subsets of some universal set U . Then the following are true:
Basic Properties
.Ac /c D A
A B D A \ Bc
Empty Set and Universal Set
De Morgan‚Äôs Laws
Subsets and Complements

A ; D A and A U D ;
;c D U and U c D ;
.A \ B/c D Ac [ B c
.A [ B/c D Ac \ B c

A  B if and only if B c  Ac

Proof. We will only prove one of De Morgan‚Äôs Laws, namely, the one that was
explored in Preview Activity 1. The proofs of the other parts are left as exercises.
Let A and B be subsets of some universal set U . We will prove that .A [ B/c D
Ac \ B c by proving that an element is in .A [ B/c if and only if it is in Ac \ B c .
So let x be in the universal set U . Then
x 2 .A [ B/c if and only if x ‚Ä¶ A [ B;

(1)

x ‚Ä¶ A [ B if and only if x ‚Ä¶ A and x ‚Ä¶ B:

(2)

and
Combining (1) and (2), we see that
x 2 .A [ B/c if and only if x ‚Ä¶ A and x ‚Ä¶ B:

(3)

5.3. Properties of Set Operations

249

In addition, we know that
x ‚Ä¶ A and x ‚Ä¶ B if and only if x 2 Ac and x 2 B c ;

(4)

and this is true if and only if x 2 Ac \ B c . So we can use (3) and (4) to conclude
that
x 2 .A [ B/c if and only if x 2 Ac \ B c ;
and, hence, that .A [ B/c D Ac \ B c .

Progress Check 5.21 (Using the Algebra of Sets)
1. Draw two general Venn diagrams for the sets A, B, and C . On one, shade the
region that represents .A [ B/ C , and on the other, shade the region that
represents .A C / [ .B C /. Explain carefully how you determined these
regions and why they indicate that .A [ B/ C D .A C / [ .B C /.
It is possible to prove the relationship suggested in Part (1) by proving that each
set is a subset of the other set. However, the results in Theorems 5.18 and 5.20 can
be used to prove other results about set operations. When we do this, we say that
we are using the algebra of sets to prove the result. For example, we can start by
using one of the basic properties in Theorem 5.20 to write
.A [ B/

C D .A [ B/ \ C c :

We can then use one of the commutative properties to write
.A [ B/

C D .A [ B/ \ C c

D C c \ .A [ B/ :

Chapter 5. Set Theory
Note: It is sometimes difficult to use the properties in the theorems when
the theorems use the same letters to represent the sets as those being used
in the current problem. For example, one of the distributive properties from
Theorems 5.18 can be written as follows: For all sets X , Y , and Z that are
subsets of a universal set U ,
X \ .Y [ Z/ D .X \ Y / [ .X \ Z/ :

Proving that Statements Are Equivalent
When we have a list of three statements P , Q, and R such that each statement in
the list is equivalent to the other two statements in the list, we say that the three
statements are equivalent. This means that each of the statements in the list implies
each of the other statements in the list.
The purpose of Preview Activity 2 was to provide one way to prove that three
(or more) statements are equivalent. The basic idea is to prove a sequence of conditional statements so that there is an unbroken chain of conditional statements
from each statement to every other statement. This method of proof will be used in
Theorem 5.22.
Theorem 5.22. Let A and B be subsets of some universal set U . The following
are equivalent:
1. A  B

2. A \ B c D ;

3. Ac [ B D U

Proof. To prove that these are equivalent conditions, we will prove that (1) implies
(2), that (2) implies (3), and that (3) implies (1).
Let A and B be subsets of some universal set U . We have proved that (1)
implies (2) in Proposition 5.14.
To prove that (2) implies (3), we will assume that A \ B c D ; and use the fact
that ;c D U . We then see that
c
A \ B c D ;c :

Then, using one of De Morgan‚Äôs Laws, we obtain
c
Ac [ B c D U

Ac [ B D U:

5.3. Properties of Set Operations

251

This completes the proof that (2) implies (3).
We now need to prove that (3) implies (1). We assume that Ac [ B D U and
will prove that A  B by proving that every element of A must be in B.

So let x 2 A. Then we know that x ‚Ä¶ Ac . However, x 2 U and since
Ac [ B D U , we can conclude that x 2 Ac [ B. Since x ‚Ä¶ Ac , we conclude that
x 2 B. This proves that A  B and hence that (3) implies (1).

Since we have now proved that (1) implies (2), that (2) implies (3), and that (3)
implies (1), we have proved that the three conditions are equivalent.

Cartesian Products

Preview Activity 1 (An Equation with Two Variables)
In Section 2.3, we introduced the concept of the truth set of an open sentence with
one variable. This was defined to be the set of all elements in the universal set that
can be substituted for the variable to make the open sentence a true statement.
In previous mathematics courses, we have also had experience with open sentences with two variables. For example, if we assume that x and y represent real
numbers, then the equation
2x C 3y D 12

5.4. Cartesian Products

255

is an open sentence with two variables. An element of the truth set of this open
sentence (also called a solution of the equation) is an ordered pair .a; b/ of real
numbers so that when a is substituted for x and b is substituted for y, the open
sentence becomes a true statement (a true equation in this case). For example, we
see that the ordered pair .6; 0/ is in the truth set for this open sentence since
2  6 C 3  0 D 12
is a true statement. On the other hand, the ordered pair .4; 1/ is not in the truth set
for this open sentence since
2  4 C 3  1 D 12
is a false statement.
Important Note: The order of the two numbers in the ordered pair is very important. We are using the convention that the first number is to be substituted for x
and the second number is to be substituted for y. With this convention, .3; 2/ is a
solution of the equation 2x C 3y D 12, but .2; 3/ is not a solution of this equation.
1. List six different elements of the truth set (often called the solution set) of
the open sentence with two variables 2x C 3y D 12.
2. From previous mathematics courses, we know that the graph of the equation
2x C 3y D 12 is a straight line. Sketch the graph of the equation 2x C
3y D 12 in the xy-coordinate plane. What does the graph of the equation
2x C 3y D 12 show?
3. Write a description of the solution set S of the equation 2x C 3y D 12 using
set builder notation.

Preview Activity 2 (The Cartesian Product of Two Sets)
In Preview Activity 1, we worked with ordered pairs without providing a formal
definition of an ordered pair. We instead relied on your previous work with ordered
pairs, primarily from graphing equations with two variables. Following is a formal
definition of an ordered pair.

256

Chapter 5. Set Theory

Definition. Let A and B be sets. An ordered pair (with first element from
A and second element from B) is a single pair of objects, denoted by .a; b/,
with a 2 A and b 2 B and an implied order. This means that for two ordered
pairs to be equal, they must contain exactly the same objects in the same order.
That is, if a; c 2 A and b; d 2 B, then
.a; b/ D .c; d / if and only if a D c and b D d:
The objects in the ordered pair are called the coordinates of the ordered pair.
In the ordered pair .a; b/, a is the first coordinate and b is the second coordinate.
We will now introduce a new set operation that gives a way of combining elements from two given sets to form ordered pairs. The basic idea is that we will
create a set of ordered pairs.
Definition. If A and B are sets, then the Cartesian product, A  B, of A and
B is the set of all ordered pairs .x; y/ where x 2 A and y 2 B. We use the
notation A  B for the Cartesian product of A and B, and using set builder
notation, we can write
A  B D f.x; y/ j x 2 A and y 2 Bg :
We frequently read A  B as ‚ÄúA cross B.‚Äù In the case where the two sets are
the same, we will write A2 for A  A. That is,
A2 D A  A D f.a; b/ j a 2 A and b 2 Ag :
Let A D f1; 2; 3g and B D fa; bg.
1. Is the ordered pair .3; a/ in the Cartesian product A  B? Explain.
2. Is the ordered pair .3; a/ in the Cartesian product A  A? Explain.
3. Is the ordered pair .3; 1/ in the Cartesian product A  A? Explain.
4. Use the roster method to specify all the elements of A  B. (Remember that
the elements of A  B will be ordered pairs.
5. Use the roster method to specify all of the elements of the set A  A D A2 .

5.4. Cartesian Products

257

6. For any sets C and D, explain carefully what it means to say that the ordered
pair .x; y/ is not in the Cartesian product C  D.

Cartesian Products
When working with Cartesian products, it is important to remember that the Cartesian product of two sets is itself a set. As a set, it consists of a collection of elements. In this case, the elements of a Cartesian product are ordered pairs. We
should think of an ordered pair as a single object that consists of two other objects
in a specified order. For example,
 If a ¬§ 1, then the ordered pair .1; a/ is not equal to the ordered pair .a; 1/.
That is, .1; a/ ¬§ .a; 1/.
 If A D f1; 2; 3g and B D fa; bg, then the ordered pair .3; a/ is an element
of the set A  B. That is, .3; a/ 2 A  B.
 If A D f1; 2; 3g and B D fa; bg, then the ordered pair .5; a/ is not an
element of the set A  B since 5 ‚Ä¶ A. That is, .5; a/ ‚Ä¶ A  B.
In Section 5.3, we studied certain properties of set union, set intersection, and
set complements, which we called the algebra of sets. We will now begin something similar for Cartesian products. We begin by examining some specific examples in Progress Check 5.23 and a little later in Progress Check 5.24.
Progress Check 5.23 (Relationships between Cartesian Products)
Let A D f1; 2; 3g, T D f1; 2g, B D fa; bg , and C D fa; cg. We can then form
new sets from all of the set operations we have studied. For example, B \C D fag,
and so

2. List all the relationships between the sets in Part (1) that you observe.

The Cartesian Plane
In Preview Activity 1, we sketched the graph of the equation 2x C 3y D 12 in the
xy-plane. This xy-plane, with which you are familiar, is a representation of the set
R  R or R2 . This plane is called the Cartesian plane.
The basic idea is that each ordered pair of real numbers corresponds to a point
in the plane, and each point in the plane corresponds to an ordered pair of real
numbers. This geometric representation of R2 is an extension of the geometric
representation of R as a straight line whose points correspond to real numbers.
Since the Cartesian product R2 corresponds to the Cartesian plane, the Cartesian product of two subsets of R corresponds to a subset of the Cartesian plane.
For example, if A is the interval ≈í1; 3¬ç, and B is the interval ≈í2; 5¬ç, then
Àö
A  B D .x; y/ 2 R2 j 1  x  3 and 2  y  5 :

A graph of the set A  B can then be drawn in the Cartesian plane as shown in
Figure 5.6.

This illustrates that the graph of a Cartesian product of two intervals of finite
length in R corresponds to the interior of a rectangle and possibly some or all of its

5.4. Cartesian Products

259

boundary. The solid line for the boundary in Figure 5.6 indicates that the boundary
is included. In this case, the Cartesian product contained all of the boundary of the
rectangle. When the graph does not contain a portion of the boundary, we usually
draw that portion of the boundary with a dotted line.
Note: A Caution about Notation. The standard notation for an open interval in R
is the same as the notation for an ordered pair, which is an element of R  R. We
need to use the context in which the notation is used to determine which interpretation is intended. For example,
p 

2; 7 to represent an

Chapter 5. Set Theory

Theorem 5.25. Let A, B, and C be sets. Then
1. A  .B \ C / D .A  B/ \ .A  C /
2. A  .B [ C / D .A  B/ [ .A  C /

.B  C /

7. If T  A, then T  B  A  B.
8. If Y  B, then A  Y  A  B.
We will not prove all these results; rather, we will prove Part (2) of Theorem 5.25 and leave some of the rest to the exercises. In constructing these proofs,
we need to keep in mind that Cartesian products are sets, and so we follow many of
the same principles to prove set relationships that were introduced in Sections 5.2
and 5.3.
The other thing to remember is that the elements of a Cartesian product are
ordered pairs. So when we start a proof of a result such as Part (2) of Theorem 5.25,
the primary goal is to prove that the two sets are equal. We will do this by proving
that each one is a subset of the other one. So if we want to prove that A.B [ C / 
.A  B/[ .A  C /, we can start by choosing an arbitrary element of A  .B [ C /.
The goal is then to show that this element must be in .A  B/[.A  C /. When we
start by choosing an arbitrary element of A  .B [ C /, we could give that element
a name. For example, we could start by letting
u be an element of A  .B [ C /:

(1)

We can then use the definition of ‚Äúordered pair‚Äù to conclude that
there exists x 2 A and there exists y 2 B [ C such that u D .x; y/ :

(2)

In order to prove that A  .B [ C /  .A  B/ [ .A  C /, we must now show that
the ordered pair u from (1) is in .A  B/ [ .A  C /. In order to do this, we can
use the definition of set union and prove that
u 2 .A  B/ or u 2 .A  C /:

(3)

5.4. Cartesian Products

261

Since u D .x; y/, we can prove (3) by proving that
.x 2 A and y 2 B/ or .x 2 A and y 2 C / :

(4)

If we look at the sentences in (2) and (4), it would seem that we are very close to
proving that A  .B [ C /  .A  B/ [ .A  C /. Following is a proof of Part (2)
of Theorem 5.25.
Theorem 5.25 (Part (2)). Let A, B, and C be sets. Then
A  .B [ C / D .A  B/ [ .A  C / :
Proof. Let A, B, and C be sets. We will prove that A  .B [ C / is equal to
.A  B/ [ .A  C / by proving that each set is a subset of the other set.
To prove that A  .B [ C /  .A  B/ [ .A  C /, we let u 2 A  .B [ C /.
Then there exists x 2 A and there exists y 2 B [ C such that u D .x; y/. Since
y 2 B [ C , we know that y 2 B or y 2 C .
In the case where y 2 B, we have u D .x; y/, where x 2 A and y 2 B. So
in this case, u 2 A  B, and hence u 2 .A  B/ [ .A  C /. Similarly, in the case
where y 2 C , we have u D .x; y/, where x 2 A and y 2 C . So in this case,
u 2 A  C and, hence, u 2 .A  B/ [ .A  C /.
In both cases, u 2 .A  B/ [ .A  C /. Hence, we may conclude that if u is an
element of A  .B [ C /, then u 2 .A  B/ [ .A  C /, and this proves that
A  .B [ C /  .A  B/ [ .A  C /:

(1)

We must now prove that .A  B/ [ .A  C /  A  .B [ C /. So we let
v 2 .A  B/ [ .A  C /. Then v 2 .A  B/ or v 2 .A  C /.
In the case where v 2 .A  B/, we know that there exists s 2 A and there
exists t 2 B such that v D .s; t /. But since t 2 B, we know that t 2 B [ C , and
hence v 2 A  .B [ C /. Similarly, in the case where v 2 .A  C /, we know that
there exists s 2 A and there exists t 2 C such that v D .s; t/. But because t 2 C ,
we can conclude that t 2 B [ C and, hence, v 2 A  .B [ C /.
In both cases, v 2 A  .B [ C /. Hence, we may conclude that if
v 2 .A  B/ [ .A  C /, then v 2 A  .B [ C /, and this proves that
.A  B/ [ .A  C /  A  .B [ C /:
The relationships in (1) and (2) prove that A.B [ C / D .A  B/[.A  C /.

Final Note. The definition of an ordered pair in Preview Activity 2 may have
seemed like a lengthy definition, but in some areas of mathematics, an even more
formal and precise definition of ‚Äúordered pair‚Äù is needed. This definition is explored in Exercise (10).

Explorations and Activities
10. (A Set Theoretic Definition of an Ordered Pair) In elementary mathematics, the notion of an ordered pair introduced at the beginning of this section
will suffice. However, if we are interested in a formal development of the
Cartesian product of two sets, we need a more precise definition of ordered
pair. Following is one way to do this in terms of sets. This definition is
credited to Kazimierz Kuratowski (1896 ‚Äì 1980). Kuratowski was a famous
Polish mathematician whose main work was in the areas of topology and set
theory. He was appointed the Director of the Polish Academy of Sciences
and served in that position for 19 years.
Let x be an element of the set A, and let y be an element of the set B. The
ordered pair .x; y/ is defined to be the set ffxg ; fx; ygg. That is,
.x; y/ D ffxg ; fx; ygg:
(a) Explain how this definition allows us to distinguish between the ordered pairs .3; 5/ and .5; 3/.
(b) Let A and B be sets and let a; c 2 A and b; d 2 B. Use this definition
of an ordered pair and the concept of set equality to prove that .a; b/ D
.c; d / if and only if a D c and b D d .
An ordered triple can be thought of as a single triple of objects, denoted
by .a; b; c/, with an implied order. This means that in order for two ordered
triples to be equal, they must contain exactly the same objects in the same
order. That is, .a; b; c/ D .p; q; r/ if and only if a D p, b D q and c D r.
(c) Let A, B, and C be sets, and let x 2 A; y 2 B; and z 2 C . Write a
set theoretic definition of the ordered triple .x; y; z/ similar to the set
theoretic definition of ‚Äúordered pair.‚Äù

Indexed Families of Sets

Preview Activity 1 (The Union and Intersection of a Family of Sets)
In Section 5.3, we discussed various properties of set operations. We will now
focus on the associative properties for set union and set intersection. Notice that
the definition of ‚Äúset union‚Äù tells us how to form the union of two sets. It is the
associative law that allows us to discuss the union of three sets. Using the associate
law, if A, B, and C are subsets of some universal set, then we can define A[B [C
to be .A [ B/ [ C or A [ .B [ C /. That is,
A [ B [ C D .A [ B/ [ C D A [ .B [ C /:
For this activity, the universal set is N and we will use the following four sets:
A D f1; 2; 3; 4; 5g

C D f3; 4; 5; 6; 7g

B D f2; 3; 4; 5; 6g

D D f4; 5; 6; 7; 8g.

1. Use the roster method to specify the sets A [ B [ C , B [ C [ D, A \ B \ C ,
and B \ C \ D.
2. Use the roster method to specify each of the following sets. In each case, be
sure to follow the order specified by the parentheses.
(a) .A [ B [ C / [ D

(e) .A \ B \ C / \ D

(c) A [ .B [ C / [ D

(g) A \ .B \ C / \ D

(b) A [ .B [ C [ D/
(d) .A [ B/ [ .C [ D/

(f) A \ .B \ C \ D/

(h) .A \ B/ \ .C \ D/

3. Based on the work in Part (2), does the placement of the parentheses matter
when determining the union (or intersection) of these four sets? Does this
make it possible to define A [ B [ C [ D and A \ B \ C \ D?
We have already seen that the elements of a set may themselves be sets. For
example, the power set of a set T , P.T /, is the set of all subsets of T . The phrase,
‚Äúa set of sets‚Äù sounds confusing, and so we often use the terms collection and
family when we wish to emphasize that the elements of a given set are themselves
sets. We would then say that the power set of T is the family (or collection) of sets
that are subsets of T .

5.5. Indexed Families of Sets

One of the purposes of the work we have done so far in this preview activity
was to show that it is possible to define the union and intersection of a family of
sets.
Definition. Let C be a family of sets. The union over C is defined as the set
of all elements that are in at least one of the sets in C. We write
[

X2C

X D fx 2 U j x 2 X for some X 2 Cg

The intersection over C is defined as the set of all elements that are in all of
the sets in C. That is,
\

X2C

X D fx 2 U j x 2 X for all X 2 Cg

For example, consider the four sets A, B, C , and D used earlier in this preview
activity and the sets
S D f5; 6; 7; 8; 9g

and T D f6; 7; 8; 9; 10g :

We can then consider the following families of sets: A D fA; B; C; Dg and

Preview Activity 2 (An Indexed Family of Sets)
We often use subscripts to identify sets. For example, in Preview Activity 1, instead
of using A, B, C , and D as the names of the sets, we could have used A1 , A2 , A3 ,
and A4 . When we do this, we are using the subscript as an identifying tag, or
index, for each set. We can also use this idea to specify an infinite family of sets.
For example, for each natural number n, we define
Cn D fn; n C 1; n C 2; n C 3; n C 4g:
So if we have a family of sets C D fC1 ; C2 ; C3 ; C4 g, we use the notation
mean the same thing as

The Union and Intersection over an Indexed Family of Sets
One of the purposes of the preview activities was to show that we often encounter
situations in which more than two sets are involved, and it is possible to define the
union and intersection of more than two sets. In Preview Activity 2, we also saw
that it is often convenient to ‚Äúindex‚Äù the sets in a family of sets. In particular, if n

5.5. Indexed Families of Sets

is a natural number and A D fA1 ; A2 ; : : : ; Ang is a family of n sets, then the union

of these n sets, denoted by A1 [ A2 [    [ An or

consists of infinitely many sets. So if B D fB1 ; B2 ; : : : ; Bn ; : : : g, then

In all of the examples we have studied so far, we have used N or a subset of N
to index or label the sets in a family of sets. We can use other sets to index or label
sets in a family of sets. For example, for each real number x, we can define Bx to
be the closed interval ≈íx; x C 2¬ç. That is,
Bx D fy 2 R j x  y  x C 2g :
So we make the following definition. In this definition, ∆í is the uppercase Greek
letter lambda and Àõ is the lowercase Greek letter alpha.
Definition. Let ∆í be a nonempty set and suppose that for each Àõ 2 ∆í, there is
a corresponding set AÀõ . The family of sets fAÀõ j Àõ 2 ∆íg is called an indexed
family of sets indexed by ∆í. Each Àõ 2 ∆í is called an index and ∆í is called
an indexing set.
Progress Check 5.27 (Indexed Families of Sets)
In each of the indexed families of sets that we seen so far, if the indices were
different, then the sets were different. That is, if ∆í is an indexing set for the family
of sets A D fAÀõ j Àõ 2 ∆íg, then if Àõ; Àá 2 ∆í and Àõ ¬§ Àá, then AÀõ ¬§ AÀá . (Note:
The letter Àá is the Greek lowercase beta.)

statement true for the indexed family of sets B D fBx j x 2 Rg?
For all x; y 2 R, if x ¬§ y, then Bx ¬§ By .
We now restate the definitions of the union and intersection of a family of sets
for an indexed family of sets.

5.5. Indexed Families of Sets

Definition. Let ∆í be a nonempty indexing set and let A D fAÀõ j Àõ 2 ∆íg
be an indexed family of sets. The union over A is defined as the set of all
elements that are in at least one of sets AÀõ , where Àõ 2 ∆í. We write
[

AÀõ D fx 2 U j there exists an Àõ 2 ∆í with x 2 AÀõ g:

The intersection over A is the set of all elements that are in all of the sets AÀõ
for each Àõ 2 ∆í. That is,
\

Àõ2∆í

AÀõ D fx 2 U j for all Àõ 2 ∆í; x 2 AÀõ g:

For each positive real number Àõ, let AÀõ be the interval . 1; Àõ¬ç. That is,
AÀõ D fx 2 R j

If we let RC be the set of positive real numbers, then we have a family of sets
indexed by RC . We will first determine the union of this family of sets. Notice
that for each Àõ 2 RC , Àõ 2 AÀõ , and if y is a real number with 1 < y  0, then
y 2 AÀõ . Also notice that if y 2 R and y < 1, then for each Àõ 2 RC , y ‚Ä¶ AÀõ .
With these observations, we conclude that

To determine the intersection of this family, notice that

Pairwise Disjoint Families of Sets
In Section 5.2, we defined two sets A and B to be disjoint provided that A\B D ;.
In a similar manner, if ∆í is a nonempty indexing set and A D fAÀõ j Àõ 2 ∆íg is
an indexed family of sets, we can say that this indexed family of sets is disjoint

to define a somewhat more interesting type of ‚Äúdisjointness‚Äù for an indexed family
of sets.
Definition. Let ∆í be a nonempty indexing set, and let A D fAÀõ j Àõ 2 ∆íg be
an indexed family of sets. We say that A is pairwise disjoint provided that
for all Àõ and Àá in ∆í, if AÀõ ¬§ AÀá , then AÀõ \ AÀá D ;.

Important Proof Method
The Choose-an-Element Method
The choose-an-element method is frequently used when we encounter a universal
quantifier in a statement in the backward process of a proof. This statement often
has the form

280

Chapter 5. Set Theory
For each element with a given property, something happens.

In the forward process of the proof, we then we choose an arbitrary element with
the given property.
Whenever we choose an arbitrary element with a given property,
we are not selecting a specific element. Rather, the only thing we
can assume about the element is the given property.

Introduction to Functions

Preview Activity 1 (Functions from Previous Courses)
One of the most important concepts in modern mathematics is that of a function.
In previous mathematics courses, we have often thought of a function as some sort
of input-output rule that assigns exactly one output to each input. So in this context, a function can be thought of as a procedure for associating with each element
of some set, called the domain of the function, exactly one element of another
set, called the codomain of the function. This procedure can be considered an
input-output-rule. The function takes the input, which is an element of the domain,
and produces an output, which is an element of the codomain. In calculus and precalculus, the inputs and outputs were almost always real numbers. So the notation
f .x/ D x 2 sin x means the following:
 f is the name of the function.
 f .x/ is a real number. It is the output of the function when the input is the
real number x. For example,

282

Chapter 6. Functions

For this function, it is understood that the domain of the function is the set R of
all real numbers. In this situation, we think of the domain as the set of all possible
inputs. That is, the domain is the set of all possible real numbers x for which a real
number output can be determined.
This is closely related to the equation y D x 2 sin x. With this equation, we
frequently think of x as the input and y as the output. In fact, we sometimes write
y D f .x/. The key to remember is that a function must have exactly one output
for each input. When we write an equation such as
yD

1 3
x
2

1;

we can use this equation to define y as a function of x. This is because when we
substitute a real number for x (the input), the equation produces exactly one real
number for y (the output). We can give this function a name, such as g, and write
y D g.x/ D

1 3
x
2

1:

However, as written, an equation such as
y2 D x C 3
cannot be used to define y as a function of x since there are real numbers that
can be substituted for x that will produce more than one possible value of y. For
example, if x D 1, then y 2 D 4, and y could be 2 or 2.
Which of the following equations can be used to define a function with x 2 R
as the input and y 2 R as the output?

Preview Activity 2 (Some Other Types of Functions)
The domain and codomain of the functions in Preview Activity 1 is the set R of all
real numbers, or some subset of R. In most of these cases, the way in which the
function associates elements of the domain with elements of the codomain is by a

6.1. Introduction to Functions

283

rule determined by some mathematical expression. For example, when we say that
f is the function such that
x
f .x/ D
;
x 1
then the algebraic rule that determines the output of the function f when the input
x
is x is
. In this case, we would say that the domain of f is the set of all real
x 1
numbers not equal to 1 since division by zero is not defined.
However, the concept of a function is much more general than this. The domain and codomain of a function can be any set, and the way in which a function
associates elements of the domain with elements of the codomain can have many
different forms. The input-output rule for a function can be a formula, a graph,
a table, a random process, or a verbal description. We will explore two different
examples in this preview activity.
1. Let b be the function that assigns to each person his or her birthday (month
and day). The domain of the function b is the set of all people and the
codomain of b is the set of all days in a leap year (i.e., January 1 through
December 31, including February 29).
(a) Explain why b really is a function. We will call this the birthday
function.
(b) In 1995, Andrew Wiles became famous for publishing a proof of Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem. (See A. D. Aczel, Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem: Unlocking the Secret of an Ancient Mathematical Problem, Dell Publishing, New York, 1996.) Andrew Wiles‚Äôs birthday is April 11, 1953.
Translate this fact into functional notation using the ‚Äúbirthday function‚Äù b. That is, fill in the spaces for the following question marks:
b. ‚Äπ / D ‚Äπ:
(c) Is the following statement true or false? Explain.
For each day D of the year, there exists a person x such that
b.x/ D D.

(d) Is the following statement true or false? Explain.
For any people x and y, if x and y are different people, then
b.x/ ¬§ b.y/.
2. Let s be the function that associates with each natural number the sum of
its distinct natural number divisors. This is called the sum of the divisors

and so

D 12:

(a) Calculate s.k/ for each natural number k from 1 through 15.
(b) Does there exist a natural number n such that s.n/ D 5? Justify your
conclusion.
(c) Is it possible to find two different natural numbers m and n such that
s.m/ D s.n/? Explain.
(d) Use your responses in (b) and (c) to determine whether the following
statements true or false.
i. For each m 2 N, there exists a natural number n such that s.n/ D
m.
ii. For all m; n 2 N, if m ¬§ n, then s.m/ ¬§ s.n/.

The Definition of a Function
The concept of a function is much more general than the idea of a function used
in calculus or precalculus. In particular, the domain and codomain do not have to
be subsets of R. In addition, the way in which a function associates elements of
the domain with elements of the codomain can have many different forms. This
input-output rule can be a formula, a graph, a table, a random process, a computer
algorithm, or a verbal description. Two such examples were introduced in Preview
Activity 2.
For the birthday function, the domain would be the set of all people and the
codomain would be the set of all days in a leap year. For the sum of the divisors
function, the domain is the set N of natural numbers, and the codomain could also
be N. In both of these cases, the input-output rule was a verbal description of how
to assign an element of the codomain to an element of the domain.
We formally define the concept of a function as follows:
Definition. A function from a set A to a set B is a rule that associates with
each element x of the set A exactly one element of the set B. A function from
A to B is also called a mapping from A to B.

6.1. Introduction to Functions

285

Function Notation. When we work with a function, we usually give it a name.
The name is often a single letter, such as f or g. If f is a function from the set A
to be the set B, we will write f W A ! B. This is simply shorthand notation for the
fact that f is a function from the set A to the set B. In this case, we also say that
f maps A to B.
Definition. Let f W A ! B. (This is read, ‚ÄúLet f be a function from A
to B.‚Äù) The set A is called the domain of the function f , and we write
A D dom.f /. The set B is called the codomain of the function f , and we
write B D codom.f /.
If a 2 A, then the element of B that is associated with a is denoted by f .a/
and is called the image of a under f. If f .a/ D b, with b 2 B, then a is
called a preimage of b under f.
Some Function Terminology with an Example. When we have a function
f W A ! B, we often write y D f .x/. In this case, we consider x to be an
unspecified object that can be chosen from the set A, and we would say that x is
the independent variable of the function f and y is the dependent variable of
the function f .
For a specific example, consider the function g W R ! R, where g.x/ is defined
by the formula
g.x/ D x 2 2:
Note that this is indeed a function since given any input x in the domain, R, there
is exactly one output g.x/ in the codomain, R. For example,
g. 2/ D . 2/2
2

2 D 2;

g.5/ D 5
2 D 23;
p 2
p
g. 2/ D
2
2 D 0;
 p 2
p
g.
2/ D
2
2 D 0:

So we say that the image of 2 under g is 2, the image of 5 under g is 23, and so
on.
pNoticepin this case that the number 0 in the codomain has two preimages,
2 and 2. This does not violate the mathematical definition of a function
since the definition only states that each input must produce one and only one output. That is, each element of the domain has exactly one image in the codomain.

286

Chapter 6. Functions

Nowhere does the definition stipulate that two different inputs must produce different outputs.
Finding the preimages of an element in the codomain can sometimes be difficult. In general, if y is in the codomain, to find its preimages, we need to ask, ‚ÄúFor
which values of x in the domain will we have y D g.x/?‚Äù For example, for the
function g, to find the preimages of 5, we need to find all x for which g.x/ D 5.
In this case, since g.x/ D x 2 2, we can do this by solving the equation
x2

2 D 5:

p
p
7
and
7. So for the function g, the preimThe solutions ofpthis equation
are
p
ages of 5 are
7 and 7. We often use
set
notation
for this and say that the set
n p p o
7; 7 .
of preimages of 5 for the function g is

Also notice that for this function, not every element in the codomain has a
preimage. For example, there is no input x such that g .x/ D 3. This is true
since for all real numbers x, x 2  0 and hence x 2 2  2. This means that for
all x in R, g .x/  2.
Finally, note that we introduced the function g with the sentence, ‚ÄúConsider the
function g W R ! R, where g.x/ is defined by the formula g.x/ D x 2 2.‚Äù This is
one correct way to do this, but we will frequently shorten this to, ‚ÄúLet g W R ! R
be defined by g.x/ D x 2 2‚Äù, or ‚ÄúLet g W R ! R, where g.x/ D x 2 2.‚Äù
Progress Check 6.1 (Images and Preimages)

The Codomain and Range of a Function
Besides the domain and codomain, there is another important set associated with
a function. The need for this was illustrated in the example of the function g on
page 285. For this function, it was noticed that there are elements in the codomain
that have no preimage or, equivalently, there are elements in the codomain that are
not the image of any element in the domain. The set we are talking about is the
subset of the codomain consisting of all images of the elements of the domain of
the function, and it is called the range of the function.
Definition. Let f W A ! B. The set ff .x/ j x 2 Ag is called the range of the
function f and is denoted by range .f /. The range of f is sometimes called
the image of the function f (or the image of A under f ).
The range of f W A ! B could equivalently be defined as follows:
range.f / D fy 2 B j y D f .x/ for some x 2 Ag:
Notice that this means that range.f /  codom.f / but does not necessarily mean
that range.f / D codom.f /. Whether we have this set equality or not depends on
the function f . More about this will be explored in Section 6.3.

For each m 2 N, there exists a natural number n such that
s.n/ D m.
Give an example of a natural number m that shows this statement is
false, and explain what this tells us about the range of the function s.

The Graph of a Real Function
We will finish this section with methods to visually communicate information
about two specific types of functions. The first is the familiar method of graphing functions that was a major part of some previous mathematics courses. For
example, consider the function g W R ! R defined by g.x/ D x 2 2x 1.

Figure 6.1: Graph of y D g.x/, where g.x/ D x 2

2x

1

Every point on this graph corresponds to an ordered pair .x; y/ of real numbers, where y D g.x/ D x 2 2x 1. Because we use the Cartesian plane when
drawing this type of graph, we can only use this type of graph when both the domain and the codomain of the function are subsets of the real numbers R. Such
a function is sometimes called a real function. The graph of a real function is a
visual way to communicate information about the function. For example, the range
of g is the set of all y-values that correspond to points on the graph. In this case,
the graph of g is a parabola and has a vertex at the point .1; 2/. (Note: The xcoordinate of the vertex can be found by using calculus and solving the equation
f 0 .x/ D 0.) Since the graph of the function g is a parabola, we know that pattern
shown on the left end and the right end of the graph continues and we can conclude

6.1. Introduction to Functions
that the range of g is the set of all y 2 R such that y 

range.g/ D fy 2 R j y  2g:
Progress Check 6.3 (Using the Graph of a Real Function)
The graph in Figure 6.2 shows the graph of (slightly more than) two complete
periods for a function f W R ! R, where f .x/ D A sin.Bx/ for some positive real
number constants A and B.

Figure 6.2: Graph of y D f .x/

1. We can use the graph to estimate the output for various inputs. This is done
by estimating the y-coordinate for the point on the graph with a specified
x-coordinate. On the graph, draw vertical lines at x D 1 and x D 2 and
estimate the values of f . 1/ and f .2/.
2. Similarly, we can estimate inputs of the function that produce a specified
output. This is done by estimating the x-coordinates of the points on the
graph that have a specified y-coordinate. Draw a horizontal line at y D 2
and estimate at least two values of x such that f .x/ D 2.
3. Use the graph Figure 6.2 to estimate the range of the function f .

Chapter 6. Functions

Arrow Diagrams
Sometimes the domain and codomain of a function are small, finite sets. When
this is the case, we can define a function simply by specifying the outputs for each
input in the domain. For example, if we let A D f1; 2; 3g and let B D fa; bg, we
can define a function F W A ! B by specifying that
F .1/ D a; F .2/ D a; and F .3/ D b:
This is a function since each element of the domain is mapped to exactly one element in B. A convenient way to illustrate or visualize this type of function is
with a so-called arrow diagram as shown in Figure 6.3. An arrow diagram can

be used when the domain and codomain of the function are finite (and small). We
represent the elements of each set with points and then use arrows to show how
the elements of the domain are associated with elements of the codomain. For example, the arrow from the point 2 in A to the point a in B represents the fact that
F .2/ D a. In this case, we can use the arrow diagram in Figure 6.3 to conclude
that range.F / D fa; bg.

5. Recall that a real function is a function whose domain and codomain are
subsets of the real numbers R. (See page 288.) Most of the functions used in
calculus are real functions. Quite often, a real function is given by a formula
or a graph with no specific reference to the domain or the codomain. In these
cases, the usual convention is to assume that the domain of the real function
f is the set of all real numbers x for which f .x/ is a real number, and that
the codomain is R. For example, if we define the (real) function f by
f .x/ D

we would be assuming that the domain is the set of all real numbers that are

of n.
A function that is related to this function is the so-called set of divisors
function. This can be defined as a function S that associates with each
natural number the set of its distinct natural number factors. For example,

More about Functions

In Section 6.1, we have seen many examples of functions. We have also seen
various ways to represent functions and to convey information about them. For
example, we have seen that the rule for determining outputs of a function can be
given by a formula, a graph, or a table of values. We have also seen that sometimes
it is more convenient to give a verbal description of the rule for a function. In cases
where the domain and codomain are small, finite sets, we used an arrow diagram to
convey information about how inputs and outputs are associated without explicitly
stating a rule. In this section, we will study some types of functions, some of which
we may not have encountered in previous mathematics courses.
Preview Activity 1 (The Number of Diagonals of a Polygon)
A polygon is a closed plane figure formed by the joining of three or more straight

lines. For example, a triangle is a polygon that has three sides; a quadrilateral is
a polygon that has four sides and includes squares, rectangles, and parallelograms;
a pentagon is a polygon that has five sides; and an octagon is a polygon that has
eight sides. A regular polygon is one that has equal-length sides and congruent
interior angles.
A diagonal of a polygon is a line segment that connects two nonadjacent vertices of the polygon. In this activity, we will assume that all polygons are convex
polygons so that, except for the vertices, each diagonal lies inside the polygon.
For example, a triangle (3-sided polygon) has no diagonals and a rectangle has two
diagonals.

would be the domain of the function, what could be the codomain of the
function, and what is the rule for computing the element of the codomain
(output) that is associated with a given element of the domain (input)?

Functions Involving Congruences
Theorem 3.31 and Corollary 3.32 (see page 150) state that an integer is congruent
(mod n) to its remainder when it is divided by n. (Recall that we always mean the
remainder guaranteed by the Division Algorithm, which is the least nonnegative
remainder.) Since this remainder is unique and since the only possible remainders
for division by n are 0; 1; 2; : : : ; n 1, we then know that each integer is congruent,
modulo n, to precisely one of the integers 0; 1; 2; : : : ; n 1. So for each natural
number n, we will define a new set Zn as follows:
Zn D f0; 1; 2; : : : ; n

1g:

For example, Z4 D f0; 1; 2; 3g and Z6 D f0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5g. We will now explore a
method to define a function from Z6 to Z6 .
For each x 2 Z6 , we can compute x 2 C 3 and then determine the value of r in
Z6 so that

x 2 C 3  r .mod 6/ :

Since r must be in Z6 , we must have 0  r < 6. The results are shown in the
following table.

The value of x in the first column can be thought of as the input for a function
with the value of r in the second column as the corresponding output. Each input
produces exactly one output. So we could write
f W Z6 ! Z6 by f .x/ D r where .x 2 C 3/  r.mod6/.
This description and the notation for the outputs of this function are quite cumbersome. So we will use a more concise notation. We will, instead, write

2. Determine g.0/, g.1/, g.2/, g.3/, and g.4/ and represent the function g with
an arrow diagram.

Equality of Functions
The idea of equality of functions has been in the background of our discussion of
functions, and it is now time to discuss it explicitly. The preliminary work for this
discussion was Preview Activity 1, in which D D N f1; 2g, and there were two
functions:
 d W D ! N[f0g, where d.n/ is the number of diagonals of a convex polygon
with n sides
 f W R ! R, where f .x/ D

x .x 3/
, for each real number x.
2

In Preview Activity 1, we saw that these two functions produced the same
outputs for certain values of the input (independent variable). For example, we can

298

Chapter 6. Functions

verify that
d.3/ D f .3/ D 0;
d.5/ D f .5/ D 5;

d.4/ D f .4/ D 2;
d.6/ D f .6/ D 9:

and

Although the functions produce the same outputs for some inputs, these are two
different functions. For example, the outputs of the function f are determined by a
formula, and the outputs of the function d are determined by a verbal description.
This is not enough, however, to say that these are two different functions. Based
on the evidence from Preview Activity 1, we might make the following conjecture:
For n  3, d.n/ D

n .n 3/
.
2

Although we have not proved this statement, it is a true statement. (See Exercise 6.)
However, we know the function d and the function f are not the same function.
For example,
 f .0/ D 0, but 0 is not in the domain of d ;
 f ./ D

 . 3/
, but  is not in the domain of d .
2

We thus see the importance of considering the domain and codomain of each of
the two functions in determining whether the two functions are equal or not. This
motivates the following definition.
Definition. Two functions f and g are equal provided that
 The domain of f equals the domain of g. That is,
dom.f / D dom.g/.
 The codomain of f equals the codomain of g. That is,
codom.f / D codom.g/.
 For each x in the domain of f (which equals the domain of g),
f .x/ D g.x/.
Progress Check 6.6 (Equality of Functions)

IZ5 W Z5 ! Z5 by IZ5 .x/ D x .mod 5/, for each x 2 Z5 .
Is the identity function on Z5 equal to either of the functions f or g from Progress
Check 6.5? Explain.

Mathematical Processes as Functions
Certain mathematical processes can be thought of as functions. In Preview Activity 2, we reviewed how to find the derivatives of certain functions, and we considered whether or not we could think of this differentiation process as a function.
If we use a differentiable function as the input and consider the derivative of that
function to be the output, then we have the makings of a function. Computer algebra systems such as Maple and Mathematica have this derivative function as one
of their predefined operators.
Following is some Maple code (using the Classic Worksheet version of Maple)
that can be used to find the derivative function of the function given by f .x/ D
x 2 .sin x/. The lines that start with the Maple prompt, ≈í> , are the lines typed by
the user. The centered lines following these show the resulting Maple output. The
first line defines the function f, and the second line uses the derivative function D
to produce the derivative of the function f.
≈í> f := x ! xb2 sin(x);

≈í> f1 := D(f);

f WD x ! x 2 sin .x/
f 1 WD x ! 2x sin .x/ C x 2 cos .x/

We must be careful when determining the domain for the derivative function since
there are functions that are not differentiable. To make things reasonably easy, we
will let F be the set of all real functions that are differentiable and call this the
domain of the derivative function D. We will use the set T of all real functions as
the codomain. So our function D is
D W F ! T by D.f / D f 0:

Carefully explain how the process of finding the average of a finite subset
of R can be thought of as a function. In doing this, be sure to specify the
domain of the function and the codomain of the function.

Sequences as Functions
A sequence can be considered to be an infinite list of objects that are indexed
(subscripted) by the natural numbers (or some infinite subset of N [ f0g). Using
this idea, we often write a sequence in the following form:
a1 ; a2 ; : : : ; an ; : : : :
In order to shorten our notation, we will often use the notation han i to represent this
sequence. Sometimes a formula can be used to represent the terms of a sequence,
and we might include this formula as the nth term in the list for a sequence such as
in the following example:
1 1
1
1; ; ; : : : ; ; : : : :
2 3
n
1
In this case, the nth term of the sequence is . If we know a formula for the nth
n
term, we often use this formula to represent the sequence. For example, we might
say
Define the sequence han i by an D

for each n 2 N.

This shows that this sequence is a function with domain N. If it is understood that
1
the domain is N, we could refer to this as the sequence
. Given an element
n
of the domain, we can consider an to be the output. In this case, we have used
subscript notation to indicate the output rather than the usual function notation.
We could just as easily write
a.n/ D

Functions of Two Variables
In Section 5.4, we learned how to form the Cartesian product of two sets. Recall
that a Cartesian product of two sets is a set of ordered pairs. For example, the set
Z  Z is the set of all ordered pairs, where each coordinate of an ordered pair is
an integer. Since a Cartesian product is a set, it could be used as the domain or
codomain of a function. For example, we could use Z  Z as the domain of a
function as follows:
Let f W Z  Z ! Z be defined by f .m; n/ D 2m C n.
 Technically, an element of Z  Z is an ordered pair, and so we should write
f ..m; n// for the output of the function f when the input is the ordered pair
.m; n/. However, the double parentheses seem unnecessary in this context

302

Chapter 6. Functions
and there should be no confusion if we write f .m; n/ for the output of the
function f when the input is .m; n/. So, for example, we simply write
f .3; 2/ D 2  3 C 2 D 8; and

f . 4; 5/ D 2  . 4/ C 5 D

3:

 Since the domain of this function is Z  Z and each element of Z  Z is an
ordered pair of integers, we frequently call this type of function a function
of two variables.

usually involves solving an equation with two variables. For example, to find the
preimages of 0 2 Z, we need to find all ordered pairs .m; n/ 2 Z  Z such that
f .m; n/ D 0. This means that we must find all ordered pairs .m; n/ 2 Z  Z such
that
2m C n D 0:
Three such ordered pairs are .0; 0/, .1; 2/, and . 1; 2/. In fact, whenever we
choose an integer value for m , we can find a corresponding integer n such that
2m C n D 0. This means that 0 has infinitely many preimages, and it may be
difficult to specify the set of all of the preimages of 0 using the roster method. One
way that can be used to specify this set is to use set builder notation and say that
the following set consists of all of the preimages of 0:
f.m; n/ 2 Z  Z j 2m C n D 0g D f.m; n/ 2 Z  Z j n D

2mg:

The second formulation for this set was obtained by solving the equation
2m C n D 0 for n.

Injections, Surjections, and Bijections

Functions are frequently used in mathematics to define and describe certain relationships between sets and other mathematical objects. In addition, functions can
be used to impose certain mathematical structures on sets. In this section, we will
study special types of functions that are used to describe these relationships that
are called injections and surjections. Before defining these types of functions, we
will revisit what the definition of a function tells us and explore certain functions
with finite domains.
Preview Activity 1 (Functions with Finite Domains)
Let A and B be sets. Given a function f W A ! B, we know the following:
 For every x 2 A, f .x/ 2 B. That is, every element of A is an input for
the function f . This could also be stated as follows: For each x 2 A, there
exists a y 2 B such that y D f .x/.
 For a given x 2 A, there is exactly one y 2 B such that y D f .x/.
The definition of a function does not require that different inputs produce different outputs. That is, it is possible to have x1 ; x2 2 A with x1 ¬§ x2 and
f .x1 / D f .x2 /. The arrow diagram for the function f in Figure 6.5 illustrates
such a function.
Also, the definition of a function does not require that the range of the function
must equal the codomain. The range is always a subset of the codomain, but these
two sets are not required to be equal. That is, if g W A ! B, then it is possible
to have a y 2 B such that g.x/ ¬§ y for all x 2 A. The arrow diagram for the
function g in Figure 6.5 illustrates such a function.

Preview Activity 2 (Statements Involving Functions)
Let A and B be nonempty sets and let f W A ! B. In Preview Activity 1, we
determined whether or not certain functions satisfied some specified properties.
These properties were written in the form of statements, and we will now examine
these statements in more detail.

6.3. Injections, Surjections, and Bijections

For all x; y 2 A, if x ¬§ y, then f .x/ ¬§ f .y/.
(a) Write the contrapositive of this conditional statement.
(b) Write the negation of this conditional statement.
2. Now consider the statement:

Write the negation of this statement.

following proofs of the following propositions about the function g.
Proposition 1. For all a; b 2 R, if g.a/ D g.b/, then a D b.
Proof . We let a; b 2 R, and we assume that g.a/ D g.b/ and will prove
that a D b. Since g.a/ D g.b/, we know that
5a C 3 D 5b C 3:
(Now prove that in this situation, a D b.)
Proposition 2. For all b 2 R, there exists an a 2 R such that g.a/ D b.
Proof . We let b 2 R. We will prove that there exists an a 2 R such that
g.a/ D b by constructing such an a in R. In order for this to happen, we
need g.a/ D 5a C 3 D b.
(Now solve the equation for a and then show that for this real number a,
g.a/ D b.)

Injections
In previous sections and in Preview Activity 1, we have seen examples of functions
for which there exist different inputs that produce the same output. Using more
formal notation, this means that there are functions f W A ! B for which there
exist x1 ; x2 2 A with x1 ¬§ x2 and f .x1 / D f .x2 /. The work in the preview
activities was intended to motivate the following definition.

310

Chapter 6. Functions

Definition. Let f W A ! B be a function from the set A to the set B. The
function f is called an injection provided that
for all x1 ; x2 2 A, if x1 ¬§ x2 , then f .x1 / ¬§ f .x2 /.
When f is an injection, we also say that f is a one-to-one function, or that
f is an injective function.
Notice that the condition that specifies that a function f is an injection is given
in the form of a conditional statement. As we shall see, in proofs, it is usually
easier to use the contrapositive of this conditional statement. Although we did not
define the term then, we have already written the contrapositive for the conditional
statement in the definition of an injection in Part (1) of Preview Activity 2. In
that preview activity, we also wrote the negation of the definition of an injection.
Following is a summary of this work giving the conditions for f being an injection
or not being an injection.

Let f W A ! B.
‚ÄúThe function f is an injection‚Äù means that
 For all x1 ; x2 2 A, if x1 ¬§ x2 , then f .x1 / ¬§ f .x2 /; or
 For all x1 ; x2 2 A, if f .x1 / D f .x2 /, then x1 D x2 .
‚ÄúThe function f is not an injection‚Äù means that
 There exist x1 ; x2 2 A such that x1 ¬§ x2 and f .x1 / D f .x2 /.
Progress Check 6.10 (Working with the Definition of an Injection)
Now that we have defined what it means for a function to be an injection, we can
see that in Part (3) of Preview Activity 2, we proved that the function g W R ! R
is an injection, where g.x/ D 5x C 3 for all x 2 R. Use the definition (or its
negation) to determine whether or not the following functions are injections.
1. k W A ! B, where A D fa; b; cg, B D f1; 2; 3; 4g, and k.a/ D 4, k.b/ D 1,
and k.c/ D 3.
2. f W A ! C , where A D fa; b; cg, C D f1; 2; 3g, and f .a/ D 2,f .b/ D 3,
and f .c/ D 2.

3x for all x 2 R

5. s W Z5 ! Z5 defined by s.x/ D x 3 .mod 5/ for all x 2 Z5 .

Surjections
In previous sections and in Preview Activity 1, we have seen that there exist functions f W A ! B for which range.f / D B. This means that every element of B is
an output of the function f for some input from the set A. Using quantifiers, this
means that for every y 2 B, there exists an x 2 A such that f .x/ D y . One of the
objectives of the preview activities was to motivate the following definition.

Definition. Let f W A ! B be a function from the set A to the set B. The
function f is called a surjection provided that the range of f equals the
codomain of f . This means that
for every y 2 B, there exists an x 2 A such that f .x/ D y.
When f is a surjection, we also say that f is an onto function or that f maps
A onto B. We also say that f is a surjective function.

One of the conditions that specifies that a function f is a surjection is given in
the form of a universally quantified statement, which is the primary statement used
in proving a function is (or is not) a surjection. Although we did not define the term
then, we have already written the negation for the statement defining a surjection
in Part (2) of Preview Activity 2. We now summarize the conditions for f being a
surjection or not being a surjection.

312

Chapter 6. Functions

Let f W A ! B.
‚ÄúThe function f is a surjection‚Äù means that
 range.f / D codom.f / D B; or
 For every y 2 B, there exists an x 2 A such that f .x/ D y.
‚ÄúThe function f is not a surjection‚Äù means that
 range.f / ¬§ codom.f /; or
 There exists a y 2 B such that for all x 2 A, f .x/ ¬§ y.
One other important type of function is when a function is both an injection and
surjection. This type of function is called a bijection.
Definition. A bijection is a function that is both an injection and a surjection.
If the function f is a bijection, we also say that f is one-to-one and onto
and that f is a bijective function.
Progress Check 6.11 (Working with the Definition of a Surjection)
Now that we have defined what it means for a function to be a surjection, we can
see that in Part (3) of Preview Activity 2, we proved that the function g W R ! R
is a surjection, where g.x/ D 5x C 3 for all x 2 R. Determine whether or not the
following functions are surjections.
1. k W A ! B, where A D fa; b; cg, B D f1; 2; 3; 4g, and k.a/ D 4, k.b/ D 1,
and k.c/ D 3.
2. f W R ! R defined by f .x/ D 3x C 2 for all x 2 R.
3. F W Z ! Z defined by F .m/ D 3m C 2 for all m 2 Z.
4. s W Z5 ! Z5 defined by s.x/ D x 3 .mod 5/ for all x 2 Z5 .

The Importance of the Domain and Codomain
The functions in the next two examples will illustrate why the domain and the
codomain of a function are just as important as the rule defining the outputs of a
function when we need to determine if the function is a surjection.

6.3. Injections, Surjections, and Bijections

313

Example 6.12 (A Function that Is Neither an Injection nor a Surjection)
Let f W R ! R be defined by f .x/ D x 2 C 1. Notice that
f .2/ D 5 and f . 2/ D 5:
This is enough to prove that the function f is not an injection since this shows that
there exist two different inputs that produce the same output.
Since f .x/ D x 2 C 1, we know that f .x/  1 for all x 2 R. This implies that
the function f is not a surjection. For example, 2 is in the codomain of f and
f .x/ ¬§ 2 for all x in the domain of f.
Example 6.13 (A Function that Is Not an Injection but Is a Surjection)
Let T D fy 2 R j y  1g, and define F W R ! T by F .x/ D x 2 C 1. As in
Example 6.12, the function F is not an injection since F .2/ D F . 2/ D 5.
Is the function F a surjection? That is, does F map R onto T ? As in Example 6.12, we do know that F .x/  1 for all x 2 R.
To see if it is a surjection, we must determine if it is true that for every y 2 T ,
there exists an x 2 R such that F .x/ D y. So we choose y 2 T. The goal is to
determine if there exists an x 2 R such that
F .x/ D y, or

2

x C 1 D y:

One way to proceed is to work backward and solve the last equation (if possible)
for x. Doing so, we get

Now, since y 2 T , we know that y  1 and hence that y 1  0. This means that

This proves that F is a surjection since we have shown that for all y 2 T, there
exists an x 2 R such that F .x/ D y. Notice that for each y 2 T, this was a
constructive proof of the existence of an x 2 R such that F .x/ D y.

314

Chapter 6. Functions

An Important Lesson. In Examples 6.12 and 6.13, the same mathematical
formula was used to determine the outputs for the functions. However, one
function was not a surjection and the other one was a surjection. This illustrates the important fact that whether a function is surjective not only depends
on the formula that defines the output of the function but also on the domain
and codomain of the function.
The next example will show that whether or not a function is an injection also
depends on the domain of the function.
Example 6.14 (A Function that Is an Injection but Is Not a Surjection)
Let Z D fx 2 Z j x  0g D N [ f0g. Define g W Z ! N by g.x/ D x 2 C 1.
(Notice that this is the same formula used in Examples 6.12 and 6.13.) Following
is a table of values for some inputs for the function g.

g.x/

x

g.x/
10

26

Notice that the codomain is N, and the table of values suggests that some natural
numbers are not outputs of this function. So it appears that the function g is not a
surjection.
To prove that g is not a surjection, pick an element of N that does not appear
to be in the range. We will use 3, and we will use a proof by contradiction to prove
that there is no x in the domain .Z / such that g.x/ D 3. So we assume that there
exists an x 2 Z with g.x/ D 3. Then
x2 C 1 D 3

x2 D 2

p
x D Àô 2:

p
But this is not possible since 2 ‚Ä¶ Z . Therefore, there is no x 2 Z with
g.x/ D 3. This means that for every x 2 Z , g.x/ ¬§ 3. Therefore, 3 is not in the
range of g, and hence g is not a surjection.
The table of values suggests that different inputs produce different outputs, and
hence that g is an injection. To prove that g is an injection, assume that s; t 2 Z

6.3. Injections, Surjections, and Bijections

315

(the domain) with g.s/ D g.t /. Then
s2 C 1 D t 2 C 1
s2 D t 2:

Since s; t 2 Z , we know that s  0 and t  0. So the preceding equation implies
that s D t . Hence, g is an injection.
An Important Lesson. The functions in the three preceding examples all
used the same formula to determine the outputs. The functions in Examples 6.12 and 6.13 are not injections but the function in Example 6.14 is an
injection. This illustrates the important fact that whether a function is injective not only depends on the formula that defines the output of the function
but also on the domain of the function.

Determine if each of these functions is an injection or a surjection. Justify

graph of y D e x . A reasonable graph can be obtained using 3  x  3
and 2  y  10. Please keep in mind that the graph is does not prove your
conclusions, but may help you arrive at the correct conclusions, which will still
need proof.

Working with a Function of Two Variables
It takes time and practice to become efficient at working with the formal definitions
of injection and surjection. As we have seen, all parts of a function are important
(the domain, the codomain, and the rule for determining outputs). This is especially
true for functions of two variables.
For example, we define f W R  R ! R  R by
f .a; b/ D .2a C b; a

b/ for all .a; b/ 2 R  R:

Notice that both the domain and the codomain of this function is the set R  R.
Thus, the inputs and the outputs of this function are ordered pairs of real numbers.
For example,
f .1; 1/ D .3; 0/ and f . 1; 2/ D .0; 3/:
To explore whether or not f is an injection, we assume that .a; b/ 2 R  R,
.c; d / 2 R  R, and f .a; b/ D f .c; d /. This means that
.2a C b; a

b/ D .2c C d; c

d /:

Since this equation is an equality of ordered pairs, we see that
2a C b D 2c C d, and
a

bDc

d:

By adding the corresponding sides of the two equations in this system, we obtain
3a D 3c and hence, a D c. Substituting a D c into either equation in the system
give us b D d . Since a D c and b D d , we conclude that
.a; b/ D .c; d /:
Hence, we have shown that if f .a; b/ D f .c; d /, then .a; b/ D .c; d /. Therefore,
f is an injection.
Now, to determine if f is a surjection, we let .r; s/ 2 R  R, where .r; s/ is
considered to be an arbitrary element of the codomain of the function f . Can we
find an ordered pair .a; b/ 2 R  R such that f .a; b/ D .r; s/? Working backward,
we see that in order to do this, we need
.2a C b; a

b/ D .r; s/:

That is, we need
2a C b D r

and a

b D s:

Solving this system for a and b yields
aD

r 2s
r Cs
and b D
:

Since r; s 2 R, we can conclude that a 2 R and b 2 R and hence that .a; b/ 2 R  R.

This proves that for all .r; s/ 2 R  R, there exists .a; b/ 2 R  R such that
f .a; b/ D .r; s/. Hence, the function f is a surjection. Since f is both an injection
and a surjection, it is a bijection.
Progress Check 6.16 (A Function of Two Variables)
Let g W R  R ! R be defined by g.x; y/ D 2x C y, for all .x; y/ 2 R  R.
Note: Be careful! One major difference between this function and the previous
example is that for the function g, the codomain is R, not R  R. It is a good idea
to begin by computing several outputs for several inputs (and remember that the
inputs are ordered pairs).
1. Notice that the ordered pair .1; 0/ 2 R  R. That is .1; 0/ is in the domain
of g. Also notice that g.1; 0/ D 2. Is it possible to find another ordered pair
.a; b/ 2 R  R such that g.a; b/ D 2?
2. Let z 2 R. Then .0; z/ 2 R  R and so .0; z/ 2 dom .g/. Now determine

Suggestions. Start by calculating several outputs for the function before
you attempt to write a proof. In exploring whether or not the function is an

based on whether the output is positive or less than or equal to zero.

The outputs of most real functions we have studied in previous mathematics courses

Composition of Functions
There are several ways to combine two existing functions to create a new function.
For example, in calculus, we learned how to form the product and quotient of two
functions and then how to use the product rule to determine the derivative of a
product of two functions and the quotient rule to determine the derivative of the
quotient of two functions.
The chain rule in calculus was used to determine the derivative of the composition of two functions, and in this section, we will focus only on the composition
of two functions. We will then consider some results about the compositions of
injections and surjections.
The basic idea of function composition is that when possible, the output of a
function f is used as the input of a function g. This can be referred to as ‚Äúf
followed by g‚Äù and is called the composition of f and g. In previous mathematics
courses, we used this idea to determine a formula for the composition of two real
functions.
For example, if
f .x/ D 3x 2 C 2 and

g.x/ D sin x;

then we can compute g.f .x// as follows:
g.f .x// D g 3x 2 C 2




D sin 3x 2 C 2 :

In this case, f .x/, the output of the function f , was used as the input for the
function g. We now give the formal definition of the composition of two functions.
Definition. Let A, B, and C be nonempty sets, and let f W A ! B and
g W B ! C be functions. The composition of f and g is the function
g ƒ± f W A ! C defined by
.g ƒ± f /.x/ D g .f .x//
for all x 2 A. We often refer to the function g ƒ± f as a composite function.
It is helpful to think of the composite function g ƒ± f as ‚Äúf followed by g.‚Äù
We then refer to f as the inner function and g as the outer function.

326

Chapter 6. Functions

Composition and Arrow Diagrams
The concept of the composition of two functions can be illustrated with arrow
diagrams when the domain and codomain of the functions are small, finite sets.
Although the term ‚Äúcomposition‚Äù was not used then, this was done in Preview
Activity 1, and another example is given here.
Let A D fa; b; c; d g, B D fp; q; rg, and C D fs; t; u; vg. The arrow diagram

g W B ! B defined by g.1/ D 3, g.2/ D 1, and g.3/ D 2.
Create arrow diagrams for the functions f , g, g ƒ± f , and g ƒ± g.

Decomposing Functions
We use the chain rule in calculus to find the derivative of a composite function.
The first step in the process is to recognize a given function as a composite function.
This can be done in many ways, but the work in Preview Activity 2 can be used
to decompose a function in a way that works well with the chain rule. The use of
the terms ‚Äúinner function‚Äù and ‚Äúouter function‚Äù can also be helpful. The idea is
that we use the last step in the process to represent the outer function, and the steps
prior to that to represent the inner function. So for the function,
f W R ! R by f .x/ D .3x C 2/3 ;
the last step in the verbal description table was to cube the result. This means that
we will use the function g (the cubing function) as the outer function and will use
the prior steps as the inner function. We will denote the inner function by h. So we
let h W R ! R by h.x/ D 3x C 2 and g W R ! R by g.x/ D x 3 . Then
.g ƒ± h/.x/ D g .h.x//

D g.3x C 2/

D .3x C 2/3

We see that g ƒ±h D f and, hence, we have ‚Äúdecomposed‚Äù the function f . It should
be noted that there are other ways to write the function f as a composition of two
functions, but the way just described is the one that works well with the chain rule.
In this case, the chain rule gives

Theorems about Composite Functions
If f W A ! B and g W B ! C , then we can form the composite function g ƒ± f W
A ! C . In Section 6.3, we learned about injections and surjections. We now
explore what type of function g ƒ± f will be if the functions f and g are injections
(or surjections).
Progress Check 6.19 (Compositions of Injections and Surjections)
Although other representations of functions can be used, it will be helpful to use
arrow diagrams to represent the functions in this progress check. We will use the
following sets:
A D fa; b; cg;

B D fp; q; rg;

C D fu; v; w; xg;

and D D fu; vg:

1. Draw an arrow diagram for a function f W A ! B that is an injection and an
arrow diagram for a function g W B ! C that is an injection. In this case, is
the composite function g ƒ± f W A ! C an injection? Explain.
2. Draw an arrow diagram for a function f W A ! B that is a surjection and an
arrow diagram for a function g W B ! D that is a surjection. In this case, is

3. Draw an arrow diagram for a function f W A ! B that is a bijection and an
arrow diagram for a function g W B ! A that is a bijection. In this case, is
the composite function g ƒ± f W A ! A bijection? Explain.
In Progress Check 6.19, we explored some properties of composite functions
related to injections, surjections, and bijections. The following theorem contains

6.4. Composition of Functions

329

results that these explorations were intended to illustrate. Some of the proofs will
be included in the exercises.
Theorem 6.20. Let A, B, and C be nonempty sets and assume that f W A ! B
and g W B ! C .
1. If f and g are both injections, then .g ƒ± f / W A ! C is an injection.
2. If f and g are both surjections, then .g ƒ± f / W A ! C is a surjection.
3. If f and g are both bijections, then .g ƒ± f / W A ! C is a bijection.
The proof of Part (1) is Exercise (6). Part (3) is a direct consequence of the first
two parts. We will discuss a process for constructing a proof of Part (2). Using
the forward-backward process, we first look at the conclusion of the conditional
statement in Part (2). The goal is to prove that g ƒ± f is a surjection. Since g ƒ± f W
A ! C , this is equivalent to proving that
For all c 2 C , there exists an a 2 A such that .g ƒ± f /.a/ D c.
Since this statement in the backward process uses a universal quantifier, we
will use the choose-an-element method and choose an arbitrary element c in the
set C . The goal now is to find an a 2 A such that .g ƒ± f /.a/ D c.
Now we can look at the hypotheses. In particular, we are assuming that both
f W A ! B and g W B ! C are surjections. Since we have chosen c 2 C , and
g W B ! C is a surjection, we know that
there exists a b 2 B such that g.b/ D c.
Now, b 2 B and f W A ! B is a surjection. Hence
there exists an a 2 A such that f .a/ D b.
If we now compute .g ƒ± f /.a/, we will see that
.g ƒ± f /.a/ D g .f .a// D g.b/ D c:
We can now write the proof as follows:

330

Chapter 6. Functions

Proof of Theorem 6.20, Part (2). Let A, B, and C be nonempty sets and assume
that f W A ! B and g W B ! C are both surjections. We will prove that g ƒ± f W
A ! C is a surjection.
Let c be an arbitrary element of C . We will prove there exists an a 2 A such
that .g ƒ± f /.a/ D c. Since g W B ! C is a surjection, we conclude that
there exists a b 2 B such that g.b/ D c.
Now, b 2 B and f W A ! B is a surjection. Hence
there exists an a 2 A such that f .a/ D b.
We now see that
.g ƒ± f /.a/ D g .f .a//
D g.b/
D c:

We have now shown that for every c 2 C , there exists an a 2 A such that
.g ƒ± f /.a/ D c, and this proves that g ƒ± f is a surjection.

Theorem 6.20 shows us that if f and g are both special types of functions, then
the composition of f followed by g is also that type of function. The next question
is, ‚ÄúIf the composition of f followed by g is an injection (or surjection), can we
make any conclusions about f or g?‚Äù A partial answer to this question is provided
in Theorem 6.21. This theorem will be investigated and proved in the Explorations

2. If g ƒ± f W A ! C is a surjection, then g W B ! C is a surjection.

Chapter 6. Functions

Inverse Functions

For this section, we will use the concept of Cartesian product of two sets A and B,
denoted by A  B, which is the set of all ordered pairs .x; y/ where x 2 A and
y 2 B. That is,
A  B D f.x; y/ j x 2 A and y 2 Bg :
See Preview Activity 2 in Section 5.4 for a more thorough discussion of this concept.
Preview Activity 1 (Functions and Sets of Ordered Pairs)
When we graph a real function, we plot ordered pairs in the Cartesian plane where
the first coordinate is the input of the function and the second coordinate is the
output of the function. For example, if g W R ! R, then every point on the graph of
g is an ordered pair .x; y/ of real numbers where y D g.x/. This shows how we
can generate ordered pairs from a function. It happens that we can do this with any
function. For example, let
A D f1; 2; 3g and B D fa; bg :
Define the function F W A ! B by
F .1/ D a;

F .2/ D b;

and F .3/ D b:

We can convert each of these to an ordered pair in A  B by using the input as
the first coordinate and the output as the second coordinate. For example, F .1/ D
a is converted to .1; a/, F .2/ D b is converted to .2; b/, and F .3/ D b is converted
to .3; b/. So we can think of this function as a set of ordered pairs, which is a subset
of A  B, and write
F D f.1; a/; .2; b/; .3; b/g:
Note: Since F is the name of the function, it is customary to use F as the name
for the set of ordered pairs.
1. Let A D f1; 2; 3g and let C D fa; b; c; d g. Define the function g W A ! C
by g.1/ D a, g.2/ D b, and g.3/ D d . Write the function g as a set of
ordered pairs in A  C .
For another example, if we have a real function, such as g W R ! R by g.x/ D
x 2 2, then we can think of g as the following infinite subset of R  R:
Àö
g D .x; y/ 2 R  R j y D x 2 2 :

6.5. Inverse Functions

335

Àö
We can also write this sometimes write this as g D .x; x 2

2/ j x 2 R .

2. Let f W Z ! Z be defined by f .m/ D 3m C 5, for all m 2 Z. Use set builder
notation to write the function f as a set of ordered pairs, and then use the
roster method to write the function f as a set of ordered pairs.

So any function f W A ! B can be thought of as a set of ordered pairs that is a
subset of A  B. This subset is
f D f.a; f .a// j a 2 Ag

or f D f.a; b/ 2 A  B j b D f .a/g:

On the other hand, if we started with A D f1; 2; 3g, B D fa; bg, and
G D f.1; a/; .2; a/; .3; b/g  A  B;
then we could think of G as a function from A to B with G.1/ D a, G.2/ D a,
and G.3/ D b: The idea is to use the first coordinate of each ordered pair as the
input, and the second coordinate as the output. However, not every subset of A  B
can be used to define a function from A to B. This is explored in the following
questions.
3. Let f D f.1; a/; .2; a/; .3; a/; .1; b/g. Could this set of ordered pairs be
used to define a function from A to B? Explain.
4. Let g D f.1; a/; .2; b/; .3; a/g. Could this set of ordered pairs be used to
define a function from A to B? Explain.
5. Let h D f.1; a/; .2; b/g. Could this set of ordered pairs be used to define a
function from A to B? Explain.

g.q/, g.r/, and g.s/?
4. Construct a table of values for each of the functions g ƒ± f W A ! A and
f ƒ± g W B ! B. What do you observe about these tables of values?

The Ordered Pair Representation of a Function
In Preview Activity 1, we observed that if we have a function f W A ! B, we can
generate a set of ordered pairs f that is a subset of A  B as follows:
f D f.a; f .a// j a 2 Ag

or f D f.a; b/ 2 A  B j b D f .a/g:

However, we also learned that some sets of ordered pairs cannot be used to define
a function. We now wish to explore under what conditions a set of ordered pairs
can be used to define a function. Starting with a function f W A ! B, since
dom.f / D A, we know that
For every a 2 A; there exists a b 2 B such that .a; b/ 2 f:

(1)

Specifically, we use b D f .a/. This says that every element of A can be used as
an input. In addition, to be a function, each input can produce only one output. In
terms of ordered pairs, this means that there will never be two ordered pairs .a; b/
and .a; c/ in the function f where a 2 A, b; c 2 B, and b ¬§ c. We can formulate
this as a conditional statement as follows:
For every a 2 A and every b; c 2 B;

if .a; b/ 2 f and .a; c/ 2 f; then b D c:

(2)

This also means that if we start with a subset f of A  B that satisfies conditions (1) and (2), then we can consider f to be a function from A to B by using
b D f .a/ whenever .a; b/ is in f . This proves the following theorem.
Theorem 6.22. Let A and B be nonempty sets and let f be a subset of A  B that
satisfies the following two properties:
 For every a 2 A, there exists b 2 B such that .a; b/ 2 f; and
 For every a 2 A and every b; c 2 B, if .a; b/ 2 f and .a; c/ 2 f , then
b D c.
If we use f .a/ D b whenever .a; b/ 2 f , then f is a function from A to B.

6.5. Inverse Functions

337

A Note about Theorem 6.22. The first condition in Theorem 6.22 means that
every element of A is an input, and the second condition ensures that every input
has exactly one output. Many texts will use Theorem 6.22 as the definition of a
function. Many mathematicians believe that this ordered pair representation of a
function is the most rigorous definition of a function. It allows us to use set theory
to work with and compare functions. For example, equality of functions becomes
a question of equality of sets. Therefore, many textbooks will use the ordered pair
representation of a function as the definition of a function.
Progress Check 6.23 (Sets of Ordered Pairs that Are Not Functions)
Let A D f1; 2; 3g and let B D fa; bg. Explain why each of the following subsets
of A  B cannot be used to define a function from A to B.
1. F D f.1; a/; .2; a/g.

2. G D f.1; a/; .2; b/; .3; c/; .2; c/g.

The Inverse of a Function
In previous mathematics courses, we learned that the exponential function (with
base e) and the natural logarithm functions are inverses of each other. This was
often expressed as follows:

For each x 2 R with x > 0 and for each y 2 R;
y D ln x if and only if x D e y :

Notice that this means that x is the input and y is the output for the natural logarithm function if and only if y is the input and x is the output for the exponential
function. In essence, the inverse function (in this case, the exponential function)
reverses the action of the original function (in this case, the natural logarithm function). In terms of ordered pairs (input-output pairs), this means that if .x; y/ is
an ordered pair for a function, then .y; x/ is an ordered pair for its inverse. This
idea of reversing the roles of the first and second coordinates is the basis for our
definition of the inverse of a function.

338

Chapter 6. Functions

Definition. Let f W A ! B be a function. The inverse of f, denoted by f
is the set of ordered pairs f.b; a/ 2 B  A j f .a/ D bg. That is,

D f.b; a/ 2 B  A j f .a/ D bg:

If we use the ordered pair representation for f, we could also write
f

D f.b; a/ 2 B  A j .a; b/ 2 f g:

Notice that this definition does not state that f 1 is a function. It is simply a
subset of B  A. After we study the material in Chapter 7, we will say that this
means that f 1 is a relation from B to A. This fact, however, is not important to
us now. We are mainly interested in the following question:
Under what conditions will the inverse of the function f W A ! B be a
function from B to A?

6.5. Inverse Functions

339

We will now consider a general argument suggested by the explorations in
Progress Check 6.24. By definition, if f W A ! B is a function, then f 1 is a
subset of B  A. However, f 1 may or may not be a function from B to A. For
example, suppose that s; t 2 A with s ¬§ t and f .s/ D f .t /. This is represented in
Figure 6.9.
A

f

B

s
t

y
z

Figure 6.9: The Inverse Is Not a Function
In this case, if we try to reverse the arrows, we will not get a function from B
to A. This is because .y; s/ 2 f 1 and .y; t/ 2 f 1 with s ¬§ t . Consequently,
f 1 is not a function. This suggests that when f is not an injection, then f 1 is
not a function.
Also, if f is not a surjection, then there exists a z 2 B such that f .a/ ¬§ z for
all a 2 A, as in the diagram in Figure 6.9. In other words, there is no ordered pair
in f with z as the second coordinate. This means that there would be no ordered
pair in f 1 with z as a first coordinate. Consequently, f 1 cannot be a function
from B to A.
This motivates the statement in Theorem 6.25. In the proof of this theorem,
we will frequently change back and forth from the input-output representation of
a function and the ordered pair representation of a function. The idea is that if
G W S ! T is a function, then for s 2 S and t 2 T,
G.s/ D t if and only if .s; t / 2 G:
When we use the ordered pair representation of a function, we will also use the
ordered pair representation of its inverse. In this case, we know that
.s; t/ 2 G if and only if .t; s/ 2 G

Theorem 6.25. Let A and B be nonempty sets and let f W A ! B. The inverse of
f is a function from B to A if and only if f is a bijection.
Proof. Let A and B be nonempty sets and let f W A ! B. We will first assume

340

Chapter 6. Functions

that f is a bijection and prove that f 1 is a function from B to A. To do this, we
will show that f 1 satisfies the two conditions of Theorem 6.22.
We first choose b 2 B. Since the function f is a surjection, there exists an
a 2 A such that f .a/ D b. This implies that .a; b/ 2 f and hence that .b; a/ 2
f 1 . Thus, each element of B is the first coordinate of an ordered pair in f 1 ,
and hence f 1 satisfies the first condition of Theorem 6.22.
To prove that f 1 satisfies the second condition of Theorem 6.22, we must
show that each element of B is the first coordinate of exactly one ordered pair in
f 1 . So let b 2 B, a1 ; a2 2 A and assume that
.b; a1 / 2 f

1

and .b; a2 / 2 f

1

:

This means that .a1 ; b/ 2 f and .a2 ; b/ 2 f . We can then conclude that
f .a1 / D b and f .a2 / D b:
But this means that f .a1 / D f .a2 /. Since f is a bijection, it is an injection, and
we can conclude that a1 D a2 . This proves that b is the first element of only
one ordered pair in f 1 . Consequently, we have proved that f 1 satisfies both
conditions of Theorem 6.22 and hence that f 1 is a function from B to A.
We now assume that f 1 is a function from B to A and prove that f is a
bijection. First, to prove that f is an injection, we assume that a1 ; a2 2 A and that
f .a1 / D f .a2 /. We wish to show that a1 D a2 . If we let b D f .a1 / D f .a2 /,
we can conclude that
.a1 ; b/ 2 f and .a2 ; b/ 2 f:
But this means that

.b; a1 / 2 f
Since we have assumed that f
Hence, f is an injection.

and .b; a2 / 2 f

:

is a function, we can conclude that a1 D a2 .

Now to prove that f is a surjection, we choose b 2 B and will show that there
exists an a 2 A such that f .a/ D b. Since f 1 is a function, b must be the first
coordinate of some ordered pair in f 1 . Consequently, there exists an a 2 A such
that
.b; a/ 2 f 1 :
Now this implies that .a; b/ 2 f and hence that f .a/ D b. This proves that f is a
surjection. Since we have also proved that f is an injection, we conclude that f is
a bijection.

Inverse Function Notation
In the situation where f W A ! B is a bijection and f 1 is a function from B to A,
we can write f 1 W B ! A. In this case, we frequently say that f is an invertible
function, and we usually do not use the ordered pair representation for either f or
f 1 . Instead of writing .a; b/ 2 f , we write f .a/ D b, and instead of writing
.b; a/ 2 f 1 , we write f 1 .b/ D a. Using the fact that .a; b/ 2 f if and only
if .b; a/ 2 f 1 , we can now write f .a/ D b if and only if f 1 .b/ D a. We
summarize this in Theorem 6.26.
Theorem 6.26. Let A and B be nonempty sets and let f W A ! B be a bijection.
Then f 1 W B ! A is a function, and for every a 2 A and b 2 B,
f .a/ D b if and only if f

.b/ D a:

Example 6.27 (Inverse Function Notation)
For an example of the use of the notation in Theorem 6.26, let RC D fx 2 R j x > 0g.
Define
f W R ! R by f .x/ D x 3 ; and g W R ! RC by g.x/ D e x .
Notice that RC is the codomain of g. We can then say that both f and g are
bijections. Consequently, the inverses of these functions are also functions. In fact,

.g ƒ± f / 1 is a function and, in fact, .g ƒ± f / 1 W C ! A. Notice that we can
also form the composition of g 1 followed by f 1 to get f 1 ƒ± g 1 W C ! A.

Proof. Let f W A ! B and g W B ! C be bijections. Then f 1 W B ! A and
g 1 W C ! B. Hence, f 1 ƒ± g 1 W C ! A. Also, by Theorem 6.20, g ƒ± f W A ! C
is a bijection, and hence .g ƒ± f / 1 W C ! A. We will now prove that for each
z 2 C , .g ƒ± f / 1 .z/ D .f 1 ƒ± g 1 /.z/.
Let z 2 C . Since the function g is a surjection, there exists a y 2 B such that
g.y/ D z:

Also, since f is a surjection, there exists an x 2 A such that

Explorations and Activities
13. Constructing an Inverse Function. If f W A ! B is a bijection, then
we know that its inverse is a function. If we are given a formula for the
function f , it may be desirable to determine a formula for the function f 1 .
This can sometimes be done, while at other times it is very difficult or even
impossible.
Let f W R ! R be defined by f .x/ D 2x 3 7. A graph of this function
would suggest that this function is a bijection.
(a) Prove that the function f is an injection and a surjection.
Let y 2 R. One way to prove that f is a surjection is to set y D f .x/
and solve for x. If this can be done, then we would know that there exists
an x 2 R such that f .x/ D y. For the function f , we are using x for the

to write a formula where y is the input and x is the output. This formula
represents the inverse function.

f 1 .y/, where f 1 W R ! R.

14. The Inverse Sine Function. We have seen that in order to obtain an inverse
function, it is sometimes necessary to restrict the domain (or the codomain)
of a function.
(a) Let f W R ! R be defined by f .x/ D sin x. Explain why the inverse
of the function f is not a function. (A graph may be helpful.)
Notice that if we use the ordered pair representation, then the sine function
can be represented as
f D f.x; y/ 2 R  R j y D sin xg:
If we denote the inverse of the sine function by sin
f

1

, then

D f.y; x/ 2 R  R j y D sin xg:

Part (14a) proves that f 1 is not a function. However, in previous mathematics courses, we frequently used the ‚Äúinverse sine function.‚Äù This is not
really the inverse of the sine function as defined in Part (14a)
but, rather,
it is

The inverse of the function in Part (14b) is itself a function and is called the
inverse sine function (or sometimes the arcsine function).
(c) What is the domain of the inverse sine function? What are the range
and codomain of the inverse sine function?
Let us now use F .x/ D Sin.x/ to represent the restricted sine function in
Part (14b). Therefore, F 1 .x/ D Sin 1 .x/ can be used to represent the
inverse sine function. Observe that

the set fg.x/ j x 2 ≈í1; 2¬çg. This is the set of all images of the real numbers

then use the resulting information to describe the set

Functions Acting on Sets
In our study of functions, we have focused on how a function ‚Äúmaps‚Äù individual elements of its domain to the codomain. We also studied the preimage of an
individual element in its codomain. For example, if f W R ! R is defined by
f .x/ D x 2 , for each x 2 R, then
 f .2/ D 4. We say that f maps 2 to 4 or that 4 is the image of 2 under the
function f .
 Since f .x/ D 4 implies that x D 2 or x D 2, we say that the preimages of
4 are 2 and 2 or that the set of preimages of 4 is f 2; 2g.
For a function f W S ! T , the next step is to consider subsets of S or T and
what corresponds to them in the other set. We did this in the Preview Activities. We
will give some definitions and then revisit the examples in the Preview Activities
in light of these definitions. We will first consider the situation where A is a subset
of S and consider the set of outputs whose inputs are from A. This will be a subset
of T .
Definition. Let f W S ! T. If A  S , then the image of A under f is the
set f .A/, where
f .A/ D ff .x/ j x 2 Ag:
If there is no confusion as to which function is being used, we call f .A/ the
image of A.
We now consider the situation in which C is a subset of T and consider the
subset of A consisting of all elements of T whose outputs are in C .
Definition. Let f W S ! T . If C  T , then the preimage of C under f is
the set f 1 .C /, where
f

.C / D fx 2 S j f .x/ 2 C g :

If there is no confusion as to which function is being used, we call f 1 .C /
the preimage of C . The preimage of the set C under f is also called the
inverse image of C under f.
Notice that the set f

The examples in Progress Check 6.32 and Example 6.33 were meant to illustrate general results about how functions act on sets. In particular, we investigated
how the action of a function on sets interacts with the set operations of intersection and union. We will now state the theorems that these examples were meant to

Preview Activity 1 (The United States of America)
Recall from Section 5.4 that the Cartesian product of two sets A and B, written
A  B, is the set of all ordered pairs .a; b/, where a 2 A and b 2 B. That is,
A  B D f.a; b/ j a 2 A and b 2 Bg.
Let A be the set of all states in the United States and let
R D f.x; y/ 2 A  A j x and y have a land border in commong:
For example, since California and Oregon have a land border, we can say that
.California, Oregon/ 2 R and .Oregon, California/ 2 R. Also, since California and Michigan do not share a land border, (California, Michigan) ‚Ä¶ R and
.Michigan, California/ ‚Ä¶ R.
1. Use the roster method to specify the elements in each of the following sets:
(a) B D fy 2 A j.Michigan, y/ 2 R g

(b) C D fx 2 A j.x; Michigan/ 2 R g

(c) D D fy 2 A j.Wisconsin, y/ 2 R g

2. Find two different examples of two ordered pairs, .x; y/ and .y; z/ such that

For all x; y; z 2 A, if .x; y/ 2 R and .y; z/ 2 R, then .x; z/ 2 R.

3. Is the following conditional statement true or false? Explain.
For all x; y 2 A, if .x; y/ 2 R, then .y; x/ 2 R.
Preview Activity 2 (The Solution Set of an Equation with Two Variables)
In Section 2.3, we introduced the concept of the truth set of an open sentence with
one variable. This was defined to be the set of all elements in the universal set that
can be substituted for the variable to make the open sentence a true proposition.
Assume that x and y represent real numbers. Then the equation
4x 2 C y 2 D 16
is an open sentence with two variables. An element of the truth set of this open
sentence (also called a solution of the equation) is an ordered pair .a; b/ of real
numbers so that when a is substituted for x and b is substituted for y, the predicate
becomes a true statement (a true equation in this case). We can use set builder
notation to describe the truth set S of this equation with two variables as follows:
Àö
S D .x; y/ 2 R  R j 4x 2 C y 2 D 16 :
When a set is a truth set of an open sentence that is an equation, we also call the
set the solution set of the equation.
1. List four different elements of the set S.
2. The graph of the equation 4x 2 C y 2 D 16 in the xy-coordinate plane is an
ellipse. Draw the graph and explain why this graph is a representation of the
truth set (solutions set) of the equation 4x 2 C y 2 D 16.
3. Describe each of the following sets as an interval of real numbers:
Àö
(a) A D x 2 R j there exists a y 2 R such that 4x 2 C y 2 D 16 .
Àö
(b) B D y 2 R j there exists an x 2 R such that 4x 2 C y 2 D 16 .

Introduction to Relations
In Section 6.1, we introduced the formal definition of a function from one set to
another set. The notion of a function can be thought of as one way of relating the
elements of one set with those of another set (or the same set). A function is a

364

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations

special type of relation in the sense that each element of the first set, the domain,
is ‚Äúrelated‚Äù to exactly one element of the second set, the codomain.
This idea of relating the elements of one set to those of another set using ordered pairs is not restricted to functions. For example, we may say that one integer,
a, is related to another integer, b, provided that a is congruent to b modulo 3. Notice that this relation of congruence modulo 3 provides a way of relating one integer
to another integer. However, in this case, an integer a is related to more than one
other integer. For example, since
5  5 .mod 3/;

5  2 .mod 3/;

and 5 

1 .mod 3/;

we can say that 5 is related to 3, 5 is related to 2, and 5 is related to 1. Notice that,
as with functions, each relation of the form a  b .mod 3/ involves two integers
a and b and hence involves an ordered pair .a; b/, which is an element of Z  Z.
Definition. Let A and B be sets. A relation R from the set A to the set B
is a subset of A  B. That is, R is a collection of ordered pairs where the first
coordinate of each ordered pair is an element of A, and the second coordinate
of each ordered pair is an element of B.
A relation from the set A to the set A is called a relation on the set A. So a
relation on the set A is a subset of A  A.
In Section 6.1, we defined the domain and range of a function. We make similar
definitions for a relation.
Definition. If R is a relation from the set A to the set B, then the subset of
A consisting of all the first coordinates of the ordered pairs in R is called the
domain of R. The subset of B consisting of all the second coordinates of the
ordered pairs in R is called the range of R.
We use the notation dom.R/ for the domain of R and range.R/ for the range
of R. So using set builder notation,
dom.R/ D fu 2 A j .u; y/ 2 R for at least one y 2 Bg

range.R/ D fv 2 B j .x; v/ 2 R for at least one x 2 Ag:

7.1. Relations

365

Example 7.1 (Domain and Range)
A relation was studied in each of
Àö the Preview Activities for this section. For Preview Activity 2, the set S D .x; y/ 2 R  R j 4x 2 C y 2 D 16 is a subset of
R  R and, hence, S is a relation on R. In Problem (3) of Preview Activity 2, we
actually determined the domain and range of this relation.
Àö
dom.S / D A D x 2 R j there exists a y 2 R such that 4x 2 C y 2 D 16
Àö
range.S / D B D y 2 R j there exists an x 2 R such that 4x 2 C y 2 D 16

So from the results in Preview Activity 2, we can say that the domain of the relation
S is the closed interval ≈í 2; 2¬ç and the range of S is the closed interval ≈í 4; 4¬ç.

R?

Some Standard Mathematical Relations
There are many different relations in mathematics. For example, two real numbers
can be considered to be related if one number is less than the other number. We

366

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations

call this the ‚Äúless than‚Äù relation on R. If x; y 2 R and x is less than y, we often
write x < y. As a set of ordered pairs, this relation is R< , where
R< D f.x; y/ 2 R  R j x < yg:
With many mathematical relations, we do not write the relation as a set of ordered
pairs even though, technically, it is a set of ordered pairs. Table 7.1 describes some
standard mathematical relations.

Table 7.1: Standard Mathematical Relations

Notation for Relations
The mathematical relations in Table 7.1 all used a relation symbol between the two
elements that form the ordered pair in A  B. For this reason, we often do the same
thing for a general relation from the set A to the set B. So if R is a relation from A
to B, and x 2 A and y 2 B, we use the notation
xRy
x 6R y

to mean
to mean

.x; y/ 2 R; and
.x; y/ ‚Ä¶ R.

In some cases, we will even use a generic relation symbol for defining a new relation or speaking about relations in a general context. Perhaps the most commonly

7.1. Relations

367

used symbol is ‚Äú‚Äù, read ‚Äútilde‚Äù or ‚Äúsquiggle‚Äù or ‚Äúis related to.‚Äù When we do this,
we will write
xy
x≈ìy

means the same thing as
means the same thing as

.x; y/ 2 R; and
.x; y/ ‚Ä¶ R.

Progress Check 7.3 (The Divides Relation)
Whenever we have spoken about one integer dividing another integer, we have
worked with the ‚Äúdivides‚Äù relation on Z. In particular, we can write
D D f.m; n/ 2 Z  Z j m divides ng:
In this case, we have a specific notation for ‚Äúdivides,‚Äù and we write
mjn

if and only if

.m; n/ 2 D.

1. What is the domain of the ‚Äúdivides‚Äù relation? What is the range of the ‚Äúdivides‚Äù relation?
2. Are the following statements true or false? Explain.
(a) For every nonzero integer a, a j a.

(b) For all nonzero integers a and b, if a j b, then b j a.

(c) For all nonzero integers a, b, and c, if a j b and b j c, then a j c.

Functions as Relations
If we have a function f W A ! B, we can generate a set of ordered pairs f that is
a subset of A  B as follows:
f D f.a; f .a// j a 2 Ag

or

f D f.a; b/ 2 A  B j b D f .a/g :

This means that f is a relation from A to B. Since, dom.f / D A, we know that
(1) For every a 2 A, there exists a b 2 B such that .a; b/ 2 f .
When .a; b/ 2 f , we write b D f .a/. In addition, to be a function, each input can
produce only one output. In terms of ordered pairs, this means that there will never
be two ordered pairs .a; b/ and .a; c/ in the function f , where a 2 A, b; c 2 B,
and b ¬§ c. We can formulate this as a conditional statement as follows:

368

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations

(2) For every a 2 A and every b; c 2 B, if .a; b/ 2 f and .a; c/ 2 f , then
b D c.
This means that a function f from A to B is a relation from A to B that satisfies
conditions (1) and (2). (See Theorem 6.22 in Section 6.5.) Not every relation,
however, will be a function. For example, consider the relation T in Progress
Check 7.2.
Àö
T D .x; y/ 2 R  R j x 2 C y 2 D 64

This relation fails condition (2) above since a counterexample comes from the facts
that .0; 8/ 2 T and .0; 8/ 2 T and 8 ¬§ 8.

Progress Check
7.4 (A Set of Ordered Pairs)
Àö
Let F D .x; y/ 2 R  R j y D x 2 . The set F can then be considered to be
relation on R since it is a subset of R  R.
1. List five different ordered pairs that are in the set F .
2. Use the roster method to specify the elements of each of the following the
sets:
(a) A D fx 2 R j .x; 4/ 2 F g

(b) B D fx 2 R j .x; 10/ 2 F g

(c) C D fy 2 R j .5; y/ 2 F g

(d) D D fy 2 R j . 3; y/ 2 F g

3. Since each real number x produces only one value of y for which y D x 2 ,
the set F can be used to define a function from the set R to R. Draw a graph
of this function.

Visual Representations of Relations
In Progress Check 7.4, we were able to draw a graph of a relation as a way to visualize the relation. In this case, the relation was a function from R to R. In addition,
in Progress Check 7.2, we were also able Àöto use a graph to represent a relation.
In this case, the graph of the relation T D .x; y/ 2 R  R j x 2 C y 2 D 64 is a
circle of radius 8 whose center is at the origin.
When R is a relation from a subset of the real numbers R to a subset of R,
we can often use a graph to provide a visual representation of the relation. This is
especially true if the relation is defined by an equation or even an inequality. For
example, if
Àö
R D .x; y/ 2 R  R j y  x 2 ;

then we can use the following graph as a way to visualize the points in the plane
that are also in this relation.
y

x

Figure 7.1: Graph of y  x 2

The points .x; y/ in the relation R are the points on the graph of y D x 2 or are in
the shaded region. This because for these points, y  x 2 . One of the shortcomings
of this type of graph is that the graph of the equation and the shaded region are
actually unbounded and so we can never show the entire graph of this relation.
However, it does allow us to see that the points in this relation are either on the
parabola defined by the equation y D x 2 or are ‚Äúinside‚Äù the parabola.
When the domain or range of a relation is infinite, we cannot provide a visualization of the entire relation. However, if A is a (small) finite set, a relation R
on A can be specified by simply listing all the ordered pairs in R. For example, if
A D f1; 2; 3; 4g, then
R D f.1; 1/; .4; 4/; .1; 3/; .3; 2/; .1; 2/; .2; 1/g
is a relation on A. A convenient way to represent such a relation is to draw a point
in the plane for each of the elements of A and then for each .x; y/ 2 R (or x R y),
we draw an arrow starting at the point x and pointing to the point y. If .x; x/ 2 R
(or x R x), we draw a loop at the point x. The resulting diagram is called a directed
graph or a digraph. The diagram in Figure 7.2 is a digraph for the relation R.
In a directed graph, the points are called the vertices. So each element of A
corresponds to a vertex. The arrows, including the loops, are called the directed
edges of the directed graph. We will make use of these directed graphs in the next
section when we study equivalence relations.

Explorations and Activities
11. The Inverse of a Relation. In Section 6.5, we introduced the inverse of a
function. If A and B are nonempty sets and if f W A ! B is a function,
then the inverse of f , denoted by f 1 , is defined as
f

1

D f.b; a/ 2 B  A j f .a/ D bg

D f.b; a/ 2 B  A j .a; b/ 2 f g:

Now that we know about relations, we see that f 1 is always a relation from
B to A. The concept of the inverse of a function is actually a special case of
the more general concept of the inverse of a relation, which we now define.

Definition. Let R be a relation from the set A to the set B. The inverse of R,
written R 1 and read ‚ÄúR inverse,‚Äù is the relation from B to A defined by

That is, R

For example, let D be the ‚Äúdivides‚Äù relation on Z. See Progress Check 7.3.
So
D D f.m; n/ 2 Z  Z j m divides ng:

374

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations
This means that we can write m j n if and only if .m; n/ 2 D. So, in this
case,
D 1 D f.n; m/ 2 Z  Z j .m; n/ 2 Dg
D f.n; m/ 2 Z  Z j m divides ng:

Now, if we would like to focus on the first coordinate instead of the second
coordinate in D 1 , we know that ‚Äúm divides n‚Äù means the same thing as ‚Äún
is a multiple of m.‚Äù Hence,
D

1

D f.n; m/ 2 Z  Z j n is a multiple of mg:

We can say that the inverse of the ‚Äúdivides‚Äù relation on Z is the ‚Äúis a multiple
of‚Äù relation on Z.
Theorem 7.6, which follows, contains some elementary facts about inverse
relations.

Equivalence Relations

Preview Activity 1 (Properties of Relations)
In previous mathematics courses, we have worked with the equality relation. For
example, let R be the relation on Z defined as follows: For all a; b 2 Z, a R b if and
only if a D b. We know this equality relation on Z has the following properties:
 For each a 2 Z, a D b and so a R a.
 For all a; b 2 Z, if a D b, then b D a. That is, if a R b, then b R a.
 For all a; b; c 2 Z, if a D b and b D c, then a D c. That is, if a R b and
b R c, then a R c.
In mathematics, when something satisfies certain properties, we often ask if other
things satisfy the same properties. Before investigating this, we will give names to
these properties.
Definition. Let A be a nonempty set and let R be a relation on A.
 The relation R is reflexive on A provided that for each x 2 A, x R x
or, equivalently, .x; x/ 2 R.
 The relation R is symmetric provided that for every x; y 2 A, if x R y,
then y R x or, equivalently, for every x; y 2 A, if .x; y/ 2 R, then
.y; x/ 2 R.
 The relation R is transitive provided that for every x; y; z 2 A, if
x R y and y R z, then x R z or, equivalently, for every x; y; z 2 A, if
.x; y/ 2 R and .y; z/ 2 R, then .x; z/ 2 R.
Before exploring examples, for each of these properties, it is a good idea to
understand what it means to say that a relation does not satisfy the property. So let
A be a nonempty set and let R be a relation on A.
1. Carefully explain what it means to say that the relation R is not reflexive on
the set A.
2. Carefully explain what it means to say that the relation R is not symmetric.
3. Carefully explain what it means to say that the relation R is not transitive.

To illustrate these properties, we let A D f1; 2; 3; 4g and define the relations R and
T on A as follows:
R D f.1; 1/; .2; 2/; .3; 3/; .4; 4/; .1; 3/; .3; 2/g
T D f.1; 1/; .1; 4/; .2; 4/; .4; 1/; .4; 2/g

the relation T symmetric? Is the relation T transitive? Explain.

2. Explain why congruence modulo n is a relation on Z.
3. Carefully review Theorem 3.30 and the proofs given on page 148 of Section 3.5. In terms of the properties of relations introduced in Preview Activity 1, what does this theorem say about the relation of congruence modulo n
on the integers?
4. Write a complete statement of Theorem 3.31 on page 150 and Corollary 3.32.
5. Write a proof of the symmetric property for congruence modulo n. That is,
prove the following:
Let a; b 2 Z and let n 2 N. If a  b .mod n/, then b  a .mod n/.

Directed Graphs and Properties of Relations
In Section 7.1, we used directed graphs, or digraphs, to represent relations on finite
sets. Three properties of relations were introduced in Preview Activity 1 and will
be repeated in the following descriptions of how these properties can be visualized
on a directed graph.
Let A be a nonempty set and let R be a relation on A.

7.2. Equivalence Relations

 The relation R is reflexive on A provided that for each x 2 A, x R x or,
equivalently, .x; x/ 2 R.
This means that if a reflexive relation is represented on a digraph, there
would have to be a loop at each vertex, as is shown in the following figure.

 The relation R is symmetric provided that for every x; y 2 A, if x R y, then
y R x or, equivalently, for every x; y 2 A, if .x; y/ 2 R, then .y; x/ 2 R.
This means that if a symmetric relation is represented on a digraph, then
anytime there is a directed edge from one vertex to a second vertex, there
would be a directed edge from the second vertex to the first vertex, as is
shown in the following figure.

 The relation R is transitive provided that for every x; y; z 2 A, if x R y and
y R z, then x R z or, equivalently, for every x; y; z 2 A, if .x; y/ 2 R and
.y; z/ 2 R, then .x; z/ 2 R. So if a transitive relation is represented by a
digraph, then anytime there is a directed edge from a vertex x to a vertex y
and a directed edge from y to a vertex z, there would be a directed edge from
x to z.
In addition, if a transitive relation is represented by a digraph, then anytime
there is a directed edge from a vertex x to a vertex y and a directed edge from
y to the vertex x, there would be loops at x and y. These two situations are
illustrated as follows:

Definition of an Equivalence Relation
In mathematics, as in real life, it is often convenient to think of two different things
as being essentially the same. For example, when you go to a store to buy a cold
soft drink, the cans of soft drinks in the cooler are often sorted by brand and type
of soft drink. The Coca Colas are grouped together, the Pepsi Colas are grouped
together, the Dr. Peppers are grouped together, and so on. When we choose a
particular can of one type of soft drink, we are assuming that all the cans are essentially the same. Even though the specific cans of one type of soft drink are
physically different, it makes no difference which can we choose. In doing this, we
are saying that the cans of one type of soft drink are equivalent, and we are using
the mathematical notion of an equivalence relation.
An equivalence relation on a set is a relation with a certain combination of
properties that allow us to sort the elements of the set into certain classes. In this
section, we will focus on the properties that define an equivalence relation, and in
the next section, we will see how these properties allow us to sort or partition the
elements of the set into certain classes.
Definition. Let A be a nonempty set. A relation  on the set A is an equivalence relation provided that  is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. For
a; b 2 A, if  is an equivalence relation on A and a  b, we say that a is
equivalent to b.
Most of the examples we have studied so far have involved a relation on a
small finite set. For these examples, it was convenient to use a directed graph to
represent the relation. It is now time to look at some other type of examples, which
may prove to be more interesting. In these examples, keep in mind that there is a
subtle difference between the reflexive property and the other two properties. The
reflexive property states that some ordered pairs actually belong to the relation R,
or some elements of A are related. The reflexive property has a universal quantifier
and, hence, we must prove that for all x 2 A, x R x. Symmetry and transitivity, on

7.2. Equivalence Relations

379

the other hand, are defined by conditional sentences. We often use a direct proof
for these properties, and so we start by assuming the hypothesis and then showing
that the conclusion must follow from the hypothesis.
Example 7.8 (A Relation that Is Not an Equivalence Relation)
Let M be the relation on Z defined as follows:
For a; b 2 Z, a M b if and only if a is a multiple of b.
So a M b if and only if there exists a k 2 Z such that a D bk.
 The relation M is reflexive on Z since for each x 2 Z, x D x  1 and, hence,
x M x.
 Notice that 4 M 2, but 2 6M 4. So there exist integers x and y such that
x M y but y 6M x. Hence, the relation M is not symmetric.
 Now assume that x M y and y M z. Then there exist integers p and q such
that
x D yp and y D zq:
Using the second equation to make a substitution in the first equation, we see
that x D z .pq/. Since pq 2 Z, we have shown that x is a multiple of z and
hence x M z. Therefore, M is a transitive relation.
The relation M is reflexive on Z and is transitive, but since M is not symmetric, it
is not an equivalence relation on Z.
Progress Check 7.9 (A Relation that Is an Equivalence Relation)

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations

Congruence Modulo n
One of the important equivalence relations we will study in detail is that of congruence modulo n. We reviewed this relation in Preview Activity 2.
Theorem 3.30 on page 148 tells us that congruence modulo n is an equivalence
relation on Z. Recall that by the Division Algorithm, if a 2 Z, then there exist
unique integers q and r such that
a D nq C r and 0  r < n:
Theorem 3.31 and Corollary 3.32 then tell us that a  r .mod n/. That is, a is
congruent modulo n to its remainder r when it is divided by n. When we use the
term ‚Äúremainder‚Äù in this context, we always mean the remainder r with 0  r < n
that is guaranteed by the Division Algorithm. We can use this idea to prove the
following theorem.
Theorem 7.10. Let n 2 N and let a; b 2 Z. Then a  b .mod n/ if and only if a
and b have the same remainder when divided by n.
Proof. Let n 2 N and let a; b 2 Z. We will first prove that if a and b have the
same remainder when divided by n, then a  b .mod n/. So assume that a and b
have the same remainder when divided by n, and let r be this common remainder.
Then, by Theorem 3.31,
a  r .mod n/ and b  r .mod n/:
Since congruence modulo n is an equivalence relation, it is a symmetric relation.
Hence, since b  r .mod n/, we can conclude that r  b .mod n/. Combining
this with the fact that a  r .mod n/, we now have
a  r .mod n/ and r  b .mod n/:
We can now use the transitive property to conclude that a  b .mod n/. This
proves that if a and b have the same remainder when divided by n, then
a  b .mod n/.
We will now prove that if a  b .mod n/, then a and b have the same remainder when divided by n. Assume that a  b .mod n/, and let r be the least
nonnegative remainder when b is divided by n. Then 0  r < n and, by Theorem 3.31,
b  r .mod n/:

7.2. Equivalence Relations

381

Now, using the facts that a  b .mod n/ and b  r .mod n/, we can use the
transitive property to conclude that
a  r .mod n/:
This means that there exists an integer q such that a

r D nq or that

a D nq C r:
Since we already know that 0  r < n, the last equation tells us that r is the
least nonnegative remainder when a is divided by n. Hence we have proven that if
a  b .mod n/, then a and b have the same remainder when divided by n.

Examples of Other Equivalence Relations
1. The relation  on Q from Progress Check 7.9 is an equivalence relation.
2. Let A be a nonempty set. The equality relation on A is an equivalence
relation. This relation is also called the identity relation on A and is denoted
by IA , where
IA D f.x; x/ j x 2 Ag:
3. Define the relation  on R as follows:

For a; b 2 R, a  b if and only if there exists an integer k such that
a b D 2k.

We will prove that the relation  is an equivalence relation on R. The relation  is reflexive on R since for each a 2 R, a a D 0 D 2  0  .

Now, let a; b 2 R and assume that a  b. We will prove that b  a. Since
a  b, there exists an integer k such that
a

b D 2k:

By multiplying both sides of this equation by 1, we obtain
. 1/.a
b

b/ D . 1/.2k /
a D 2. k/:

Since k 2 Z, the last equation proves that b  a. Hence, we have proven
that if a  b, then b  a and, therefore, the relation  is symmetric.

382

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations
To prove transitivity, let a; b; c 2 R and assume that a  b and b  c. We
will prove that a  c. Now, there exist integers k and n such that
a

b D 2k and b

c D 2n:

By adding the corresponding sides of these two equations, we see that
.a

b/ C .b

a

c/ D 2k C 2n
c D 2.k C n/:

By the closure properties of the integers, k C n 2 Z. So this proves that
a  c and, hence the relation  is transitive.

We have now proven that  is an equivalence relation on R. This equivalence
relation is important in trigonometry. If a  b, then there exists an integer
k such that a b D 2k and, hence, a D b C k.2/. Since the sine and
cosine functions are periodic with a period of 2, we see that
sin a D sin.b C k.2// D sin b; and

cos a D cos.b C k.2// D cos b:

Therefore, when a  b, each of the trigonometric functions have the same
value at a and b.
4. For an example from Euclidean geometry, we define a relation P on the set
L of all lines in the plane as follows:
For l1 ; l2 2 L, l1 P l2 if and only if l1 is parallel to l2 or l1 D l2 .

We added the second condition to the definition of P to ensure that P is reflexive on L. Theorems from Euclidean geometry tell us that if l1 is parallel
to l2 , then l2 is parallel to l1 , and if l1 is parallel to l2 and l2 is parallel to l3 ,
then l1 is parallel to l3 . (Drawing pictures will help visualize these properties.) This tells us that the relation P is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
and, hence, an equivalence relation on L.

Proof. Assume a  a. Then .a C 2a/  0 .mod 3/ since
.3a/  0 .mod 3/. Therefore,  is reflexive on Z. In addition, if
a  b, then .a C 2b/  0 .mod 3/, and if we multiply both sides of
this congruence by 2, we get
2 .a C 2b/  2  0 .mod 3/
.2a C 4b/  0 .mod 3/
.2a C b/  0 .mod 3/

.b C 2a/  0 .mod 3/ :
This means that b  a and hence,  is symmetric.
We now assume that .a C 2b/  0 .mod 3/ and .b C 2c/  0 .mod 3/.
By adding the corresponding sides of these two congruences, we obtain
.a C 2b/ C .b C 2c/  0 C 0 .mod 3/
.a C 3b C 2c/  0 .mod 3/
.a C 2c/  0 .mod 3/ :

Hence, the relation is transitive and we have proved that  is an
equivalence relation on Z.

a relation that are part of the definition of an equivalence relation. However,
there are other properties of relations that are of importance. We will study

Equivalence Classes

Preview Activity 1 (Sets Associated with a Relation)
As was indicated in Section 7.2, an equivalence relation on a set A is a relation
with a certain combination of properties (reflexive, symmetric, and transitive) that
allow us to sort the elements of the set into certain classes. This is done by means
of certain subsets of A that are associated with the elements of the set A. This will
be illustrated with the following example. Let A D fa; b; c; d; eg, and let R be the
relation on the set A defined as follows:
aRa

bRb

cRc

d Rd

aRb

bRa

bRe

eRb

aRe

eRa

cRd

d Rc

For each y 2 A, define the subset R≈íy¬ç of A as follows:
R≈íy¬ç D fx 2 A j x R yg :

eR e

388

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations

That is, R≈íy¬ç consists of those elements in A such that x R y. For example, using
y D a, we see that a R a, b R a,and e R a, and so R≈ía¬ç D fa; b; eg.
1. Determine R≈íb¬ç, R≈íc¬ç, R≈íd ¬ç, and R≈íe¬ç.
2. Draw a directed graph for the relation R and explain why R is an equivalence

4. Which of the sets R≈ía¬ç, R≈íb¬ç, R≈íc¬ç, R≈íd ¬ç, and R≈íe¬ç are disjoint?
As we will see in this section, the relationships between these sets is typical for an
equivalence relation. The following example will show how different this can be
for a relation that is not an equivalence relation.
Let A D fa; b; c; d; eg, and let S be the relation on the set A defined as follows:
bS b

cS c

dSd

aS b

aS d

bS c

cS d

dSc

5. Draw a digraph that represents the relation S on A. Explain why S is not an
equivalence relation on A.
For each y 2 A, define the subset S ≈íy¬ç of A as follows:
S ≈íy¬ç D fx 2 A j x S yg D fx 2 A j .x; y/ 2 S g :
For example, using y D b, we see that S ≈íb¬ç D fa; bg since .a; b/ 2 S and
.b; b/ 2 S . In addition, we see that S ≈ía¬ç D ; since there is no x 2 A such that
.x; a/ 2 S .
6. Determine S ≈íc¬ç, S ≈íd ¬ç, and S ≈íe¬ç.
7. Which of the sets S ≈ía¬ç, S ≈íb¬ç, S ≈íc¬ç, S ≈íd ¬ç, and S ≈íe¬ç are equal?

Preview Activity 2 (Congruence Modulo 3)
An important equivalence relation that we have studied is congruence modulo n
on the integers. We can also define subsets of the integers based on congruence
modulo n. We will illustrate this with congruence modulo 3. For example, we can
define C ≈í0¬ç to be the set of all integers a that are congruent to 0 modulo 3. That is,
C ≈í0¬ç D fa 2 Z j a  0 .mod 3/g:
Since an integer a is congruent to 0 modulo 3 if an only if 3 divides a, we can use
the roster method to specify this set as follows:
C ≈í0¬ç D f; : : : ; 9; 6; 3; 0; 3; 6; 9; : : :g :
1. Use the roster method to specify each of the following sets:
(a) The set C ≈í1¬ç of all integers a that are congruent to 1 modulo 3. That is,
C ≈í1¬ç D fa 2 Z j a  1 .mod 3/g:
(b) The set C ≈í2¬ç of all integers a that are congruent to 2 modulo 3. That is,
C ≈í2¬ç D fa 2 Z j a  2 .mod 3/g:
(c) The set C ≈í3¬ç of all integers a that are congruent to 3 modulo 3. That is,
C ≈í3¬ç D fa 2 Z j a  3 .mod 3/g:
2. Now consider the three sets, C ≈í0¬ç, C ≈í1¬ç, and C ≈í2¬ç.
(a) Determine the intersection of any two of these sets. That is, determine
C ≈í0¬ç \ C ≈í1¬ç, C ≈í0¬ç \ C ≈í2¬ç, and C ≈í1¬ç \ C ≈í2¬ç.
(b) Let n D 734. What is the remainder when n is divided by 3? Which of
the three sets, if any, contains n D 734?
(c) Repeat Part (2b) for n D 79 and for n D

79.

(d) Do you think that C ≈í0¬ç [ C ≈í1¬ç [ C ≈í2¬ç D Z? Explain.
(e) Is the set C ≈í3¬ç equal to one of the sets C ≈í0¬ç; C ≈í1¬ç, or C ≈í2¬ç?
(f) We can also define C ≈í4¬ç D fa 2 Z j a  4 .mod 3/g: Is this set equal
to any of the previous sets we have studied in this part? Explain.

390

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations

The Definition of an Equivalence Class
We have indicated that an equivalence relation on a set is a relation with a certain
combination of properties (reflexive, symmetric, and transitive) that allow us to
sort the elements of the set into certain classes. We saw this happen in the preview
activities. We can now illustrate specifically what this means. For example, in
Preview Activity 2, we used the equivalence relation of congruence modulo 3 on Z
to construct the following three sets:
C ≈í0¬ç D fa 2 Z j a  0 .mod 3/g;

C ≈í1¬ç D fa 2 Z j a  1 .mod 3/g; and
C ≈í2¬ç D fa 2 Z j a  2 .mod 3/g:

The main results that we want to use now are Theorem 3.31 and Corollary 3.32 on
page 150. This corollary tells us that for any a 2 Z, a is congruent to precisely one
of the integers 0, 1, or 2. Consequently, the integer a must be congruent to 0, 1, or
2, and it cannot be congruent to two of these numbers. Thus
1. For each a 2 Z, a 2 C ≈í0¬ç, a 2 C ≈í1¬ç, or a 2 C ≈í2¬ç; and
2. C ≈í0¬ç \ C ≈í1¬ç D ;, C ≈í0¬ç \ C ≈í2¬ç D ; , and C ≈í1¬ç \ C ≈í2¬ç D ;.
This means that the relation of congruence modulo 3 sorts the integers into
three distinct sets, or classes, and that each pair of these sets have no elements in
common. So if we use a rectangle to represent Z, we can divide that rectangle
into three smaller rectangles, corresponding to C ≈í0¬ç, C ≈í1¬ç, and C ≈í2¬ç, and we might
picture this situation as follows:
The Integers
C ≈í0¬ç consisting of
all integers with a
remainder of 0 when
divided by 3

C ≈í1¬ç consisting of
all integers with a
remainder of 1 when
divided by 3

C ≈í2¬ç consisting of
all integers with a
remainder of 2 when
divided by 3

Each integer is in exactly one of the three sets C ≈í0¬ç, C ≈í1¬ç, or C ≈í2¬ç, and two
integers are congruent modulo 3 if and only if they are in the same set. We will see
that, in a similar manner, if n is any natural number, then the relation of congruence
modulo n can be used to sort the integers into n classes. We will also see that in
general, if we have an equivalence relation R on a set A, we can sort the elements
of the set A into classes in a similar manner.

7.3. Equivalence Classes

391

Definition. Let  be an equivalence relation on a nonempty set A. For each
a 2 A, the equivalence class of a determined by  is the subset of A, denoted
by ≈ía¬ç, consisting of all the elements of A that are equivalent to a. That is,
≈ía¬ç D fx 2 A j x  ag:
We read ≈ía¬ç as ‚Äúthe equivalence class of a‚Äù or as ‚Äúbracket a.‚Äù
Notes
1. We use the notation ≈ía¬ç when only one equivalence relation is being used.
If there is more than one equivalence relation, then we need to distinguish
between the equivalence classes for each relation. We often use something
like ≈ía¬ç , or if R is the name of the relation, we can use R≈ía¬ç or ≈ía¬çR for the
equivalence class of a determined by R. In any case, always remember that
when we are working with any equivalence relation on a set A if a 2 A, then
the equivalence class ≈ía¬ç is a subset of A.
2. We know that each integer has an equivalence class for the equivalence relation of congruence modulo 3. But as we have seen, there are really only three
distinct equivalence classes. Using the notation from the definition, they are:
≈í0¬ç D fa 2 Z j a  0 .mod 3/g ; ≈í1¬ç D fa 2 Z j a  1 .mod 3/g ; and
≈í2¬ç D fa 2 Z j a  2 .mod 3/g :

Progress Check 7.12 (Equivalence Classes from Preview Activity 1)
Without using the terminology at that time, we actually determined the equivalence
classes of the equivalence relation R in Preview Activity 1. What are the distinct
equivalence classes for this equivalence relation?

Congruence Modulo n and Congruence Classes
In Preview Activity 2, we used the notation C ≈ík¬ç for the set of all integers that are
congruent to k modulo 3. We could have used a similar notation for equivalence
classes, and this would have been perfectly acceptable. However, the notation ≈ía¬ç
is probably the most common notation for the equivalence class of a. We will now
use this same notation when dealing with congruence modulo n when only one
congruence relation is under consideration.

392

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations

Definition. Let n 2 N. Congruence modulo n is an equivalence relation on
Z. So for a 2 Z,
≈ía¬ç D fx 2 Z j x  a .mod n/g:
In this case, ≈ía¬ç is called the congruence class of a modulo n.
We have seen that congruence modulo 3 divides the integers into three distinct
congruence classes. Each congruence class consists of those integers with the same
remainder when divided by 3. In a similar manner, if we use congruence modulo
2, we simply divide the integers into two classes. One class will consist of all the
integers that have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, and the other class will
consist of all the integers that have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. That is,
congruence modulo 2 simply divides the integers into the even and odd integers.
Progress Check 7.13 (Congruence Modulo 4)
Determine all of the distinct congruence classes for the equivalence relation of
congruence modulo 4 on the integers. Specify each congruence class using the
roster method.

Properties of Equivalence Classes
As we have seen, in Preview Activity 1, the relation R was an equivalence relation.
For that preview activity, we used R≈íy¬ç to denote the equivalence class of y 2 A,
and we observed that these equivalence classes were either equal or disjoint.
However, in Preview Activity 1, the relation S was not an equivalence relation,
and hence we do not use the term ‚Äúequivalence class‚Äù for this relation. We should
note, however, that the sets S ≈íy¬ç were not equal and were not disjoint. This exhibits
one of the main distinctions between equivalence relations and relations that are not
equivalence relations.
In Theorem 7.14, we will prove that if  is an equivalence relation on the set A,
then we can ‚Äúsort‚Äù the elements of A into distinct equivalence classes. The properties of equivalence classes that we will prove are as follows: (1) Every element
of A is in its own equivalence class; (2) two elements are equivalent if and only
if their equivalence classes are equal; and (3) two equivalence classes are either
identical or they are disjoint.
Theorem 7.14. Let A be a nonempty set and let  be an equivalence relation on
the set A. Then,
1. For each a 2 A, a 2 ≈ía¬ç.

7.3. Equivalence Classes

393

2. For each a; b 2 A, a  b if and only if ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç.
3. For each a; b 2 A, ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç or ≈ía¬ç \ ≈íb¬ç D ;.
Proof. Let A be a nonempty set and assume that  is an equivalence relation on
A. To prove the first part of the theorem, let a 2 A. Since  is an equivalence
relation on A, it is reflexive on A. Thus, a  a, and we can conclude that a 2 ≈ía¬ç.
The second part of this theorem is a biconditional statement. We will prove
it by proving two conditional statements. We will first prove that if a  b, then
≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç. So let a; b 2 A and assume that a  b. We will now prove that the two
sets ≈ía¬ç and ≈íb¬ç are equal. We will do this by proving that each is a subset of the
other.
First, assume that x 2 ≈ía¬ç. Then, by definition, x  a. Since we have assumed
that a  b, we can use the transitive property of  to conclude that x  b, and this
means that x 2 ≈íb¬ç. This proves that ≈ía¬ç  ≈íb¬ç.
We now assume that y 2 ≈íb¬ç. This means that y  b, and hence by the
symmetric property, that b  y. Again, we are assuming that a  b. So we have
a  b and b  y.
We use the transitive property to conclude that a  y and then, using the symmetric
property, we conclude that y  a. This proves that y 2 ≈ía¬ç and, hence, that
≈íb¬ç  ≈ía¬ç. This means that we can conclude that if a  b, then ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç.
We must now prove that if ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç, then a  b. Let a; b 2 A and assume
that ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç. Using the first part of the theorem, we know that a 2 ≈ía¬ç and since
the two sets are equal, this tells us that a 2 ≈íb¬ç. Hence by the definition of ≈íb¬ç, we
conclude that a  b. This completes the proof of the second part of the theorem.
For the third part of the theorem, let a; b 2 A. Since this part of the theorem is
a disjunction, we will consider two cases: Either
≈ía¬ç \ ≈íb¬ç D ; or

≈ía¬ç \ ≈íb¬ç ¬§ ;:

In the case where ≈ía¬ç \ ≈íb¬ç D ;, the first part of the disjunction is true, and
hence there is nothing to prove. So we assume that ≈ía¬ç \ ≈íb¬ç ¬§ ; and will show
that ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç. Since ≈ía¬ç \ ≈íb¬ç ¬§ ;, there is an element x in A such that
x 2 ≈ía¬ç \ ≈íb¬ç:
This means that x 2 ≈ía¬ç and x 2 ≈íb¬ç. Consequently, x  a and x  b, and so we
can use the second part of the theorem to conclude that ≈íx¬ç D ≈ía¬ç and ≈íx¬ç D ≈íb¬ç.
Hence, ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç, and we have proven that ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç or ≈ía¬ç \ ≈íb¬ç D ;.

Theorem 7.14 gives the primary properties of equivalence classes. Consequences of these properties will be explored in the exercises. The following table
restates the properties in Theorem 7.14 and gives a verbal description of each one.

Formal Statement from
Theorem 7.14
For each a 2 A, a 2 ≈ía¬ç.

Verbal Description
Every element of A is in its own

For each a; b 2 A, a  b if and

Two elements of A are equivalent if
and only if their equivalence classes
are equal.

For each a; b 2 A, ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç or
≈ía¬ç \ ≈íb¬ç D ;.

Any two equivalence classes are
either equal or they are disjoint.
This means that if two equivalence
classes are not disjoint then they
must be equal.

Progress Check 7.15 (Equivalence Classes)
Let f W R ! R be defined by f .x/ D x 2 4 for each x 2 R. Define a relation 
on R as follows:
For a; b 2 R, a  b if and only if f .a/ D f .b/.
In Exercise (6) of Section 7.2, we proved that  is an equivalence relation on
R. Consequently, each real number has an equivalence class. For this equivalence
relation,
1. Determine the equivalence classes of 5, 5, 10, 10, , and .
2. Determine the equivalence class of 0.
3. If a 2 R, use the roster method to specify the elements of the equivalence
class ≈ía¬ç.
The results of Theorem 7.14 are consistent with all the equivalence relations
studied in the preview activities and in the progress checks. Since this theorem
applies to all equivalence relations, it applies to the relation of congruence modulo
n on the integers. Because of the importance of this equivalence relation, these
results for congruence modulo n are given in the following corollary.

7.3. Equivalence Classes

Corollary 7.16. Let n 2 N. For each a 2 Z, let ≈ía¬ç represent the congruence class
of a modulo n.
1. For each a 2 Z, a 2 ≈ía¬ç.
2. For each a; b 2 Z, a  b .mod n/ if and only if ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç.
3. For each a; b 2 Z, ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç or ≈ía¬ç \ ≈íb¬ç D ;.
For the equivalence relation of congruence modulo n, Theorem 3.31 and Corollary 3.32 tell us that each integer is congruent to its remainder when divided by n,
and that each integer is congruent modulo n to precisely one of one of the integers
0; 1; 2; : : : ; n 1. This means that each integer is in precisely one of the congruence classes ≈í0¬ç, ≈í1¬ç, ≈í2¬ç; : : : ; ≈ín 1¬ç. Hence, Corollary 7.16 gives us the following
result.
Corollary 7.17. Let n 2 N. For each a 2 Z, let ≈ía¬ç represent the congruence class
of a modulo n.

Partitions and Equivalence Relations
A partition of a set A is a collection of subsets of A that ‚Äúbreaks up‚Äù the set A into
disjoint subsets. Technically, each pair of distinct subsets in the collection must
be disjoint. We then say that the collection of subsets is pairwise disjoint. We
introduce the following formal definition.
Definition. Let A be a nonempty set, and let C be a collection of subsets of
A. The collection of subsets C is a partition of A provided that
1. For each V 2 C, V ¬§ ;.
2. For each x 2 A, there exists a V 2 C such that x 2 V.
3. For every V; W 2 C, V D W or V \ W D ;.

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations

There is a close relation between partitions and equivalence classes since the
equivalence classes of an equivalence relation form a partition of the underlying
set, as will be proven in Theorem 7.18. The proof of this theorem relies on the
results in Theorem 7.14.
Theorem 7.18. Let  be an equivalence relation on the nonempty set A. Then the
collection C of all equivalence classes determined by  is a partition of the set A.
Proof. Let  be an equivalence relation on the nonempty set A, and let C be the
collection of all equivalence classes determined by . That is,
C D f≈ía¬ç j a 2 Ag:
We will use Theorem 7.14 to prove that C is a partition of A.
Part (1) of Theorem 7.14 states that for each a 2 A, a 2 ≈ía¬ç. In terms of the
equivalence classes, this means that each equivalence class is nonempty since each
element of A is in its own equivalence class. Consequently, C, the collection of
all equivalence classes determined by , satisfies the first two conditions of the
definition of a partition.
We must now show that the collection C of all equivalence classes determined
by  satisfies the third condition for being a partition. That is, we need to show
that any two equivalence classes are either equal or are disjoint. However, this is
exactly the result in Part (3) of Theorem 7.14.
Hence, we have proven that the collection C of all equivalence classes determined by  is a partition of the set A.

Note: Theorem 7.18 has shown us that if  is an equivalence relation on a nonempty
set A, then the collection of the equivalence classes determined by  form a partition of the set A.
This process can be reversed. This means that given a partition C of a nonempty
set A, we can define an equivalence relation on A whose equivalence classes are
precisely the subsets of A that form the partition. This will be explored in Exercise (12).

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations

The Integers Modulo n
Let n 2 N. Since the relation of congruence modulo n is an equivalence relation
on Z, we can discuss its equivalence classes. Recall that in this situation, we refer
to the equivalence classes as congruence classes.
Definition. Let n 2 N. The set of congruence classes for the relation of
congruence modulo n on Z is the set of integers modulo n, or the set of
integers mod n. We will denote this set of congruence classes by Zn .
Corollary 7.17 tells us that
Z D ≈í0¬ç [ ≈í1¬ç [ ≈í2¬ç [    [ ≈ín

1¬ç:

In addition, we know that each integer is congruent to precisely one of the integers
0; 1; 2; : : : ; n 1. This tells us that one way to represent Zn is
Zn D f≈í0¬ç; ≈í1¬ç; ≈í2¬ç; : : : ≈ín

1¬çg :

Consequently, even though each integer has a congruence class, the set Zn has only
n distinct congruence classes.
The set of integers Z is more than a set. We can add and multiply integers.
That is, there are the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication on the set
Z, and we know that Z is closed with respect to these two operations.
One of the basic problems dealt with in modern algebra is to determine if the
arithmetic operations on one set ‚Äútransfer‚Äù to a related set. In this case, the related
set is Zn . For example, in the integers modulo 5, Z5 , is it possible to add the
congruence classes ≈í4¬ç and ≈í2¬ç as follows?
≈í4¬ç Àö ≈í2¬ç D ≈í4 C 2¬ç
D ≈í6¬ç

D ≈í1¬ç:
We have used the symbol Àö to denote addition in Z5 so that we do not confuse
it with addition in Z. This looks simple enough, but there is a problem. The
congruence classes ≈í4¬ç and ≈í2¬ç are not numbers, they are infinite sets. We have to
make sure that we get the same answer no matter what element of ≈í4¬ç we use and
no matter what element of ≈í2¬ç we use. For example,
9  4 .mod 5/

7  2 .mod 5/

and so ≈í9¬ç D ≈í4¬ç: Also,
and so ≈í7¬ç D ≈í2¬ç:

7.4. Modular Arithmetic

403

Do we get the same result if we add ≈í9¬ç and ≈í7¬ç in the way we did when we added
≈í4¬ç and ≈í2¬ç? The following computation confirms that we do:
≈í9¬ç Àö ≈í7¬ç D ≈í9 C 7¬ç
D ≈í16¬ç
D ≈í1¬ç:

This is one of the ideas that was explored in Preview Activity 1. The main difference is that in this preview activity, we used the relation of congruence, and here
we are using congruence classes. All of the examples in Preview Activity 1 should
have illustrated the properties of congruence modulo 6 in the following table. The
left side shows the properties in terms of the congruence relation and the right side
shows the properties in terms of the congruence classes.
If a  3 .mod 6/ and b  4 .mod 6/, then
 .a C b/  .3 C 4/ .mod 6/;
 .a  b/  .3  4/ .mod 6/.

If ≈ía¬ç D ≈í3¬ç and ≈íb¬ç D ≈í4¬ç in
Z6 , then
 ≈ía C b¬ç D ≈í3 C 4¬ç;
 ≈ía  b¬ç D ≈í3  4¬ç.

These are illustrations of general properties that we have already proved in Theorem 3.28. We repeat the statement of the theorem here because it is so important
for defining the operations of addition and multiplication in Zn .
Theorem 3.28 Let n be a natural number and let a; b; c; and d be integers. Then
1. If a  b .mod n/ and c  d .mod n/, then .a C c/  .b C d / .mod n/.
2. If a  b .mod n/ and c  d .mod n/, then ac  bd .mod n/.
3. If a  b .mod n/ and m 2 N, then am  b m .mod n/.
Since x  y .mod n/ if and only if ≈íx¬ç D ≈íy¬ç, we can restate the result of this
Theorem 3.28 in terms of congruence classes in Zn .
Corollary 7.19. Let n be a natural number and let a; b; c and d be integers. Then,
in Zn ,

1. If ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç and ≈íc¬ç D ≈íd ¬ç, then ≈ía C c¬ç D ≈íb C d ¬ç.
2. If ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç and ≈íc¬ç D ≈íd ¬ç, then ≈ía  c¬ç D ≈íb  d ¬ç.
3. If ≈ía¬ç D ≈íb¬ç and m 2 N, then ≈ía¬çm D ≈íb¬çm .
Because of Corollary 7.19, we know that the following formal definition of addition and multiplication of congruence classes in Zn is independent of the choice
of the elements we choose from each class. We say that these definitions of addition and multiplication are well defined.
Definition. Let n 2 N. Addition and multiplication in Zn are defined as
follows: For ≈ía¬ç; ≈íc¬ç 2 Zn ,
≈ía¬ç Àö ≈íc¬ç D ≈ía C c¬ç and ≈ía¬ç Àá ≈íc¬ç D ≈íac¬ç:
The term modular arithmetic is used to refer to the operations of addition
and multiplication of congruence classes in the integers modulo n.
So if n 2 N, then we have an addition and multiplication defined on Zn , the
integers modulo n.
Always remember that for each of the equations in the definitions, the operations on the left, Àö and Àá, are the new operations that are being defined. The
operations on the right side of the equations .C and / are the known operations of
addition and multiplication in Z.
Since Zn is a finite set, it is possible to construct addition and multiplication
tables for Zn . In constructing these tables, we follow the convention that all sums
and products should be in the form ≈ír¬ç, where 0  r < n. For example, in Z3 , we
see that by the definition, ≈í1¬ç Àö ≈í2¬ç D ≈í3¬ç, but since 3  0 .mod 3/, we see that
≈í3¬ç D ≈í0¬ç and so we write
≈í1¬ç Àö ≈í2¬ç D ≈í3¬ç D ≈í0¬ç:

Similarly, by definition, ≈í2¬ç Àá ≈í2¬ç D ≈í4¬ç, and in Z3 , ≈í4¬ç D ≈í1¬ç. So we write
≈í2¬ç Àá ≈í2¬ç D ≈í4¬ç D ≈í1¬ç:

Divisibility Tests
Congruence arithmetic can be used to proof certain divisibility tests. For example,
you may have learned that a natural number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its
digits is divisible by 9. As an easy example, note that the sum of the digits of
5823 is equal to 5 C 8 C 2 C 3 D 18, and we know that 18 is divisible by 9.
It can also be verified that 5823 is divisible by 9. (The quotient is 647.) We can
actually generalize this property by dealing with remainders when a natural number
is divided by 9.
Let n 2 N and let s.n/ denote the sum of the digits of n. For example, if
n D 7319, then s.7319/ D 7 C 3 C 1 C 9 D 20. In Preview Activity 2, we saw
that

406

Chapter 7. Equivalence Relations
7319  2 .mod 9/ and 20  2 .mod 9/.

In fact, for every example in Preview Activity 2, we saw that n and s.n/ were
congruent modulo 9 since they both had the same remainder when divided by 9.
The concepts of congruence and congruence classes can help prove that this is
always true.
We will use the case of n D 7319 to illustrate the general process. We must
use our standard place value system. By this, we mean that we will write 7319 as
follows:




7319 D 7  103 C 3  102 C 1  101 C 9  100 :
(1)

The idea is to now use the definition of addition and multiplication in Z9 to convert
equation (1) to an equation in Z9 . We do this as follows:




≈í7319¬ç D ≈í 7  103 C 3  102 C 1  101 C 9  100 ¬ç

(2)

Since 103  1 .mod 9/, 102  1 .mod 9/ and 10  1 .mod 9/, we can conclude
that ≈í103 ¬ç D ≈í1¬ç, ≈í102 ¬ç D ≈í1¬ç and ≈í10¬ç D ≈í1¬ç. Hence, we can use these facts and
equation (2) to obtain

D ≈í7¬ç Àö ≈í3¬ç Àö ≈í1¬ç Àö ≈í9¬ç

D ≈í7 C 3 C 1 C 9¬ç:

(3)

Equation (3) tells us that 7319 has the same remainder when divided by 9 as the
sum of its digits. It is easy to check that the sum of the digits is 20 and hence has a
remainder of 2. This means that when 7319 is divided by 9, the remainder is 2.
To prove that any natural number has the same remainder when divided by 9
as the sum of its digits, it is helpful to introduce notation for the decimal representation of a natural number. The notation we will use is similar to the notation for
the number 7319 in equation (1).

Part (3) of Theorem 7.22 is called a divisibility test. If gives a necessary and
sufficient condition for a natural number to be divisible by 9. Other divisibility tests
will be explored in the exercises. Most of these divisibility tests can be proved in a
manner similar to the proof of the divisibility test for 9.

set under the usual operations of addition and multiplication and under the usual

Table 8.2: Properties of the Integers
We have already studied a good deal of number theory in this text in our discussion of proof methods. In particular, we have studied even and odd integers,
divisibility of integers, congruence, and the Division Algorithm. See the summary
for Chapter 3 on page 166 for a summary of results concerning even and odd integers as well as results concerning properties of divisors. We reviewed some of
these properties and the Division Algorithm in the Preview Activities.

The Greatest Common Divisor
One of the most important concepts in elementary number theory is that of the
greatest common divisor of two integers. The definition for the greatest common
divisor of two integers (not both zero) was given in Preview Activity 1.
1. If a; b 2 Z and a and b are not both 0, and if d 2 N, then d D gcd.a; b/
provided that it satisfies all of the following properties:

8.1. The Greatest Common Divisor

417

 d j a and d j b. That is, d is a common divisor of a and b.

 If k is a natural number such that k j a and k j b, then k  d. That is,
any other common divisor of a and b is less than or equal to d.

2. Consequently, a natural number d is not the greatest common divisor of a
and b provided that it does not satisfy at least one of these properties. That
is, d is not equal to gcd.a; b/ provided that
 d does not divide a or d does not divide b; or

 There exists a natural number k such that k j a and k j b and k > d.

This means that d is not the greatest common divisor of a and b provided
that it is not a common divisor of a and b or that there exists a common
divisor of a and b that is greater than d.
In the preview activities, we determined the greatest common divisors for several
pairs of integers. The process we used was to list all the divisors of both integers,
then list all the common divisors of both integers and, finally, from the list of all
common divisors, find the greatest (largest) common divisor. This method works
reasonably well for small integers but can get quite cumbersome if the integers are
large. Before we develop an efficient method for determining the greatest common
divisor of two integers, we need to establish some properties of greatest common
divisors.
One property was suggested in Preview Activity 1. If we look at the results
in Part (7) of that preview activity, we should observe that any common divisor of
a and b will divide gcd.a; b/. In fact, the primary goals of the remainder of this
section are
1. To find an efficient method for determining gcd.a; b/, where a and b are
integers.
2. To prove that the natural number gcd.a; b/ is the only natural number d that
satisfies the following properties:
 d divides a and d divides b; and

 if k is a natural number such that k j a and k j b, then k j d.

The second goal is only slightly different from the definition of the greatest common divisor. The only difference is in the second condition where k  d is replaced by k j d.

418

Chapter 8. Topics in Number Theory

We will first consider the case where a and b are integers with a ¬§ 0 and
b > 0. The proof of the result stated in the second goal contains a method
(called the Euclidean Algorithm) for determining the greatest common divisors
of the two integers a and b. The main idea of the method is to keep replacing the
pair of integers .a; b/ with another pair of integers .b; r/, where 0  r < b and
gcd.b; r/ D gcd.a; b/. This idea was explored in Preview Activity 2. Lemma 8.1
is a conjecture that could have been formulated in Preview Activity 2.
Lemma 8.1. Let c and d be integers, not both equal to zero. If q and r are integers
such that c D d  q C r, then gcd.c; d / D gcd.d; r/.
Proof. Let c and d be integers, not both equal to zero. Assume that q and r are
integers such that c D d  q C r. For ease of notation, we will let
m D gcd.c; d / and n D gcd.d; r/:
Now, m divides c and m divides d . Consequently, there exist integers x and y such
that c D mx and d D my. Hence,
r Dc

r D mx

d q

r D m.x

.my/q
yq/:

But this means that m divides r. Since m divides d and m divides r, m is less than
or equal to gcd.d; r/. Thus, m  n.
Using a similar argument, we see that n divides d and n divides r. Since
c D d  q C r, we can prove that n divides c. Hence, n divides c and n divides d .
Thus, n  gcd.c; d / or n  m. We now have m  n and n  m. Hence, m D n
and gcd.c; d / D gcd.d; r/.

Progress Check 8.2 (Illustrations of Lemma 8.1)
We completed several examples illustrating Lemma 8.1 in Preview Activity 2. For
another example, let c D 56 and d D 12. The greatest common divisor of 56 and
12 is 4.
1. According to the Division Algorithm, what is the remainder r when 56 is
divided by 12?
2. What is the greatest common divisor of 12 and the remainder r?

8.1. The Greatest Common Divisor

419

The key to finding the greatest common divisor (in more complicated cases) is
to use the Division Algorithm again, this time with 12 and r. We now find integers
q2 and r2 such that
12 D r  q2 C r2 :
3. What is the greatest common divisor of r and r2?

The Euclidean Algorithm
The example in Progress Check 8.2 illustrates the main idea of the Euclidean Algorithm for finding gcd.a; b/, which is explained in the proof of the following
theorem.
Theorem 8.3. Let a and b be integers with a ¬§ 0 and b > 0. Then gcd.a; b/ is
the only natural number d such that
(a) d divides a and d divides b, and
(b) if k is an integer that divides both a and b, then k divides d .
Proof. Let a and b be integers with a ¬§ 0 and b > 0, and let d D gcd.a; b/. By
the Division Algorithm, there exist integers q1 and r1 such that
a D b  q1 C r1 , and 0  r1 < b:

(1)

If r1 D 0, then equation (1) implies that b divides a. Hence, b D d D gcd.a; b/
and this number satisfies Conditions (a) and (b).
If r1 > 0, then by Lemma 8.1, gcd.a; b/ D gcd.b; r1 /. We use the Division
Algorithm again to obtain integers q2 and r2 such that
b D r1  q2 C r2 , and 0  r2 < r1 :

(2)

If r2 D 0, then equation (2) implies that r1 divides b. This means that r1 D
gcd.b; r1 /. But we have already seen that gcd.a; b/ D gcd.b; r1 /. Hence, r1 D
gcd.a; b/. In addition, if k is an integer that divides both a and b, then, using
equation (1), we see that r1 D a b  q1 and, hence k divides r1 . This shows that
r1 D gcd.a; b/ satisfies Conditions (a) and (b).
If r2 > 0, then by Lemma 8.1, gcd.b; r1 / D gcd.r1 ; r2 /. But we have already
seen that gcd.a; b/ D gcd.b; r1 /. Hence, gcd.a; b/ D gcd.r1 ; r2 /. We now continue to apply the Division Algorithm to produce a sequence of pairs of integers

From the inequalities in the third column of this table, we have a strictly decreasing
sequence of nonnegative integers .b > r1 > r2 > r3 > r4   /. Consequently, a
term in this sequence must eventually be equal to zero. Let p be the smallest

Remember that this table was constructed by repeated use of Lemma 8.1 and that
the greatest common divisor of each pair of integers produced equals gcd.a; b/.
Also, the last row in the table indicates that rp divides rp 1 . This means that
gcd.rp 1 ; rp / D rp and hence rp D gcd.a; b/.
This proves that rp D gcd.a; b/ satisfies Condition (a) of this theorem. Now
assume that k is an integer such that k divides a and k divides b. We proceed
through the table row by row. First, since r1 D a b  q, we see that
k must divide r1 .
The second row tells us that r2 D b
we conclude that

r1  q2 . Since k divides b and k divides r1 ,

k divides r2 .

8.1. The Greatest Common Divisor

Some Remarks about Theorem 8.3
Theorem 8.3 was proven with the assumptions that a; b 2 Z with a ¬§ 0 and b > 0.
A more general version of this theorem can be proven with a; b 2 Z and b ¬§ 0.
This can be proven using Theorem 8.3 and the results in the following lemma.
Lemma 8.5. Let a; b 2 Z with b ¬§ 0. Then
1. gcd.0; b/ D jbj.
2. If gcd.a; b/ D d , then gcd.a; b/ D d .
The proofs of these results are in Exercise (4). An application of this result is given
in the next example.

Writing gcd.a; b/ in Terms of a and b
We will use Example 8.6 to illustrate another use of the Euclidean Algorithm. It
is possible to use the steps of the Euclidean Algorithm in reverse order to write
gcd.a; b/ in terms of a and b. We will use these steps in reverse order to find
integers m and n such that gcd.234; 42/ D 234m C 42n. The idea is to start
with the row with the last nonzero remainder and work backward as shown in the
following table:
Explanation
First, use the equation in Step 3 to
write 6 in terms of 24 and 18.
Use the equation in Step 2 to write
18 D 42 24  1. Substitute this into
the preceding result and simplify.
We now have written 6 in terms of
42 and 24. Use the equation in

Substitute this into the preceding
result and simplify.

Hence, we can write
gcd.234; 42/ D 234  2 C 42  . 11/:
(Check this with a calculator.) In this case, we say that we have written
gcd.234; 42/ as a linear combination of 234 and 42. More generally, we have
the following definition.

8.1. The Greatest Common Divisor

Definition. Let a and b be integers. A linear combination of a and b is an
integer of the form ax C by, where x and y are integers.
Progress Check 8.7 (Writing the gcd as a Linear Combination)
Use the results from Progress Check 8.4 to

2. Write gcd.4208; 288/ as a linear combination of 4208 and 288.
The previous example and progress check illustrate the following important
result in number theory, which will be used in the next section to help prove some
other significant results.
Theorem 8.8. Let a and b be integers, not both 0. Then gcd.a; b/ can be written
as a linear combination of a and b. That is, there exist integers u and v such that
gcd.a; b/ D au C bv.
We will not give a formal proof of this theorem. Hopefully, the examples
and activities provide evidence for its validity. The idea is to use the steps of the
Euclidean Algorithm in reverse order to write gcd.a; b/ as a linear combination of
a and b. For example, assume the completed table for the Euclidean Algorithm is

We can use Step 3 to write r3 D gcd.a; b/ as a linear combination of r1 and r2 . We
can then solve the equation in Step 2 for r2 and use this to write r3 D gcd.a; b/ as
a linear combination of r1 and b. We can then use the equation in Step 1 to solve
for r1 and use this to write r3 D gcd.a; b/ as a linear combination of a and b.
In general, if we can write rp D gcd.a; b/ as a linear combination of a pair
in a given row, then we can use the equation in the preceding step to write rp D
gcd.a; b/ as a linear combination of the pair in this preceding row.
The notational details of this induction argument get quite involved. Many
mathematicians prefer to prove Theorem 8.8 using a property of the natural numbers called the Well-Ordering Principle. The Well-Ordering Principle for the

424

Chapter 8. Topics in Number Theory

natural numbers states that any nonempty set of natural numbers must contain a
least element. It can be proven that the Well-Ordering Principle is equivalent to the
Principle of Mathematical Induction.

1. Give examples of four natural numbers that are prime and four natural numbers that are composite.
Theorem 4.9 in Section 4.2 states that every natural number greater than 1 is

When a composite number is written as a product of prime numbers, we say
that we have obtained a prime factorization of that composite number. For example, since 60 D 22  3  5, we say that 22  3  5 is a prime factorization of 60.

Greatest Common Divisors and Linear Combinations
In Section 8.1, we introduced the concept of the greatest common divisor of two
integers. We showed how the Euclidean Algorithm can be used to find the greatest
common divisor of two integers, a and b, and also showed how to use the results
of the Euclidean Algorithm to write the greatest common divisor of a and b as a
linear combination of a and b.
In this section, we will use these results to help prove the so-called Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that any natural number greater than 1 that
is not prime can be written as product of primes in ‚Äúessentially‚Äù only one way. This
means that given two prime factorizations, the prime factors are exactly the same,
and the only difference may be in the order in which the prime factors are written.
We start with more results concerning greatest common divisors. We first prove
Proposition 5.16, which was part of Exercise (18) on page 243 in Section 5.2 and
Exercise (8) on page 425in Section 8.1.
Proposition 5.16 Let a, b, and t be integers with t ¬§ 0. If t divides a and t divides
b, then for all integers x and y, t divides (ax + by).

428

Chapter 8. Topics in Number Theory

Proof. Let a, b, and t be integers with t ¬§ 0, and assume that t divides a and t
divides b. We will prove that for all integers x and y, t divides .ax C by/.
So let x 2 Z and let y 2 Z. Since t divides a, there exists an integer m such
that a D mt and since t divides b, there exists an integer n such that b D nt .
Using substitution and algebra, we then see that
ax C by D .mt /x C .nt /y
D t .mx C ny/

Since .mx C ny/ is an integer, the last equation proves that t divides ax C by and
this proves that for all integers x and y, t divides .ax C by/.

We now let a; b 2 Z, not both 0, and let d D gcd.a; b/. Theorem 8.8 states
that d can be written as a linear combination of a and b. Now, since d j a and
d j b, we can use the result of Proposition 5.16 to conclude that for all x; y 2 Z,
d j .ax C by/. This means that d divides every linear combination of a and b.
In addition, this means that d must be the smallest positive number that is a linear
combination of a and b. We summarize these results in Theorem 8.9.
Theorem 8.9. Let a; b 2 Z, not both 0.
1. The greatest common divisor, d , is a linear combination of a and b. That is,
there exist integers m and n such that d D am C bn.
2. The greatest common divisor, d , divides every linear combination of a and
b. That is, for all x; y 2 Z , d j .ax C by/.
3. The greatest common divisor, d , is the smallest positive number that is a
linear combination of a and b.

Relatively Prime Integers
In Preview Activity 1, we constructed several examples of integers a, b, and c such
that a j .bc/ but a does not divide b and a does not divide c. For each example,
we observed that gcd.a; b/ ¬§ 1 and gcd.a; c/ ¬§ 1.
We also constructed several examples where a j .bc/ and gcd.a; b/ D 1. In all
of these cases, we noted that a divides c. Integers whose greatest common divisor
is equal to 1 are given a special name.
Definition. Two nonzero integers a and b are relatively prime provided that
gcd.a; b/ D 1.

Theorem 8.11. Let a and b be nonzero integers, and let p be a prime number.
1. If a and b are relatively prime, then there exist integers m and n such that
am C bn D 1. That is, 1 can be written as linear combination of a and b.
2. If p j a, then gcd.a; p/ D p.
3. If p does not divide a, then gcd.a; p/ D 1.
Part (1) of Theorem 8.11 is actually a corollary of Theorem 8.9. Parts (2)
and (3) could have been the conjectures you formulated in Progress Check 8.10.
The proofs are included in Exercise (1).
Given nonzero integers a and b, we have seen that it is possible to use the
Euclidean Algorithm to write their greatest common divisor as a linear combination
of a and b. We have also seen that this can sometimes be a tedious, time-consuming
process, which is why people have programmed computers to do this. Fortunately,
in many proofs of number theory results, we do not actually have to construct this
linear combination since simply knowing that it exists can be useful in proving
results. This will be illustrated in the proof of Theorem 8.12, which is based on
work in Preview Activity 1.
Theorem 8.12. Let a, b, be nonzero integers and let c be an integer. If a and b are
relatively prime and a j .bc/, then a j c.

430

Chapter 8. Topics in Number Theory

The explorations in Preview Activity 1 were related to this theorem. We will
first explore the forward-backward process for the proof. The goal is to prove that
a j c. A standard way to do this is to prove that there exists an integer q such that
c D aq:

(1)

Since we are given that a j .bc/, there exists an integer k such that
bc D ak:

(2)

It may seem tempting to divide both sides of equation (2) by b, but if we do so,
we run into problems with the fact that the integers are not closed under division.
Instead, we look at the other part of the hypothesis, which is that a and b are
relatively prime. This means that gcd.a; b/ D 1. How can we use this? This
means that a and b have no common factors except for 1. In light of equation (2),
it seems reasonable that any factor of a must also be a factor of c. But how do we
formalize this?
One conclusion that we can use is that since gcd.a; b/ D 1, by Theorem 8.11,
there exist integers m and n such that
am C bn D 1:

(3)

We may consider solving equation (3) for b and substituting this into equation (2). The problem, again, is that in order to solve equation (3) for b, we need
to divide by n.
Before doing anything else, we should look at the goal in equation (1). We
need to introduce c into equation (3). One way to do this is to multiply both sides
of equation (3) by c. (This keeps us in the system of integers since the integers are
closed under multiplication.) This gives
.am C bn/ c D 1  c
acm C bcn D c:

(4)

Notice that the left side of equation (4) contains a term, bcn, that contains bc. This
means that we can use equation (2) and substitute bc D ak in equation (4). After
doing this, we can factor the left side of the equation to prove that a j c.

p j .a1 a2    an /, then there exists a natural number k with 1  k  n

Part (1) of Corollary 8.14 is a corollary of Theorem 8.12. Part (2) is proved using mathematical induction. The basis step is the case where n D 1, and Part (1) is
the case where n D 2. The proofs of these two results are included in Exercises (2)
and (3).

Historical Note
Part (1) of Corollary 8.14 is known as Euclid‚Äôs Lemma. Most people associate
geometry with Euclid‚Äôs Elements, but these books also contain many basic results
in number theory. Many of the results that are contained in this section appeared
in Euclid‚Äôs Elements.

Prime Numbers and Prime Factorizations
We are now ready to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. The first part
of this theorem was proved in Theorem 4.9 in Section 4.2. This theorem states
that each natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or is a product of
prime numbers. Before we state the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we will
discuss some notational conventions that will help us with the proof. We start with
an example.
We will use n D 120. Since 5 j 120, we can write 120 D 5  24. In addition,
we can factor 24 as 24 D 2  2  2  3. So we can write
120 D 5  24

D 5 .2  2  2  3/ :

This is a prime factorization of 120, but it is not the way we usually write this
factorization. Most often, we will write the prime number factors in ascending
order. So we write
120 D 2  2  2  3  5 or 120 D 23  3  5:

432

Chapter 8. Topics in Number Theory

Now, let n 2 N. To write the prime factorization of n with the prime factors in
ascending order requires that if we write n D p1 p2    pr , where p1 ; p2 ;    pr are
prime numbers, we will have p1  p2      pr .
Theorem 8.15 (The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).
1. Each natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or is a product
of prime numbers.
2. Let n 2 N with n > 1. Assume that
n D p1 p2    pr and that n D q1 q2    qs ;
where p1 ; p2 ;    pr and q1 ; q2 ;    qs are primes with p1  p2      pr
and q1  q2      qs . Then r D s, and for each j from 1 to r, pj D qj .
Proof. The first part of this theorem was proved in Theorem 4.9. We will prove
the second part of the theorem by induction on n using the Second Principle of
Mathematical Induction. (See Section 4.2.) For each natural number n with n > 1,
let P .n/ be
If n D p1 p2    pr and n D q1 q2    qs , where p1 ; p2 ;    pr and q1 ; q2;    qs
are primes with p1  p2      pr and q1  q2      qs , then r D s,
and for each j from 1 to r, pj D qj .
For the basis step, we notice that since 2 is a prime number, its only factorization is 2 D 1  2. This means that the only equation of the form 2 D p1 p2    pr ,
where p1 ; p2 ;    pr are prime numbers, is the case where r D 1 and p1 D 2. This
proves that P .2/ is true.
For the inductive step, let k 2 N with k  2. We will assume that
P .2/; P .3/; : : : ; P .k/ are true. The goal now is to prove that P .k C 1/ is true.
To prove this, we assume that .k C 1/ has two prime factorizations and then prove
that these prime factorizations are the same. So we assume that
k C 1 D p1 p2    pr and that k C 1 D q1 q2    qs , where p1 ; p2 ;    pr and
q1 ; q2 ;    qs are primes with p1  p2      pr and q1  q2      qs .
We must now prove that r D s, and for each j from 1 to r, pj D qj . We can
break our proof into two cases: (1) p1  q1 ; and (2) q1  p1 . Since one of these
must be true, and since the proofs will be similar, we can assume, without loss of
generality, that p1  q1 .

8.2. Prime Numbers and Prime Factorizations

433

Since k C 1 D p1 p2    pr , we know that p1 j .k C 1/, and hence we may
conclude that p1 j .q1 q2    qs /. We now use Corollary 8.14 to conclude that there
exists a j with 1  j  s such that p1 j qj . Since p1 and qj are primes, we
conclude that
p1 D qj :
We have also assumed that q1  qj for all j and, hence, we know that q1  p1 .
However, we have also assumed that p1  q1 . Hence,
p1 D q1 :
We now use this and the fact that k C 1 D p1 p2    pr D q1 q2    qs to conclude
that
p2    pr D q2    qs :
The product in the previous equation is less that k C 1. Hence, we can apply our
induction hypothesis to these factorizations and conclude that r D s, and for each
j from 2 to r, pj D qj .
This completes the proof that if P .2/; P .3/; : : : ; P .k/ are true, then P .k C 1/
is true. Hence, by the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, we conclude
that P .n/ is true for all n 2 N with n  2. This completes the proof of the
theorem.


Note: : We often shorten the result of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic by
simply saying that each natural number greater than one that is not a prime has a
unique factorization as a product of primes. This simply means that if n 2 N,
n > 1, and n is not prime, then no matter how we choose to factor n into a product
of primes, we will always have the same prime factors. The only difference may
be in the order in which we write the prime factors.

Further Results and Conjectures about Prime Numbers
1. The Number of Prime Numbers
Prime numbers have fascinated mathematicians for centuries. For example,
we can easily start writing a list of prime numbers in ascending order. Following is a list of the prime numbers less than 100.
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71,
73, 79, 83, 89, 97

434

Chapter 8. Topics in Number Theory
This list contains the first 25 prime numbers. Does this list ever stop? The
question was answered in Euclid‚Äôs Elements, and the result is stated in Theorem 8.16. The proof of this theorem is considered to be one of the classical
proofs by contradiction.
Theorem 8.16. There are infinitely many prime numbers.
Proof. We will use a proof by contradiction. We assume that there are only
finitely many primes, and let
p1 ; p2 ; : : : ; pm
be the list of all the primes. Let
M D p1 p2    pm C 1:

(1)

Notice that M ¬§ 1. So M is either a prime number or, by the Fundamental
Theorem of Arithmetic, M is a product of prime numbers. In either case,
M has a factor that is a prime number. Since we have listed all the prime
numbers, this means that there exists a natural number j with 1  j  m
such that pj j M . Now, we can rewrite equation (1) as follows:
1DM

p1 p2    pm :

(2)

We have proved pj j M , and since pj is one of the prime factors of p1 p2    pm ,
we can also conclude that pj j .p1 p2    pm /. Since pj divides both of the
terms on the right side of equation (2), we can use this equation to conclude
that pj divides 1. This is a contradiction since a prime number is greater
than 1 and cannot divide 1. Hence, our assumption that there are only finitely
many primes is false, and so there must be infinitely many primes.

2. The Distribution of Prime Numbers
There are infinitely many primes, but when we write a list of the prime numbers, we can see some long sequences of consecutive natural numbers that
contain no prime numbers. For example, there are no prime numbers between 113 and 127. The following theorem shows that there exist arbitrarily
long sequences of consecutive natural numbers containing no prime numbers. A guided proof of this theorem is included in Exercise (15).
Theorem 8.17. For any natural number n, there exist at least n consecutive
natural numbers that are composite numbers.

8.2. Prime Numbers and Prime Factorizations

There are many unanswered questions about prime numbers, two of which will
now be discussed.
3. The Twin Prime Conjecture
By looking at the list of the first 25 prime numbers, we see several cases
where consecutive prime numbers differ by 2. Examples are: 3 and 5; 11
and 13; 17 and 19; 29 and 31. Such pairs of prime numbers are said to be
twin primes. How many twin primes exist? The answer is not known. The
Twin Prime Conjecture states that there are infinitely many twin primes.
As of June 25, 2010, this is still a conjecture as it has not been proved or
disproved.
For some interesting information on prime numbers, visit the Web site The
Prime Pages (http://primes.utm.edu/), where there is a link to The Largest
Known Primes Web site. According to information at this site as of June 25,
2010, the largest known twin primes are

65516468355  2333333 1 and 65516468355  2333333 C 1 :
Each of these prime numbers contains 100355 digits.

4. Goldbach‚Äôs Conjecture
Given an even natural number, is it possible to write it as a sum of two prime
numbers? For example,
4D 2C2

78 D 37 C 41

6D 3C3

90 D 43 C 47

8 D 5C3

138 D 67 C 71

One of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics is a conjecture
made by Christian Goldbach in a letter to Leonhard Euler in 1742. The
conjecture, now known as Goldbach‚Äôs Conjecture, is as follows:
Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two
(not necessarily distinct) prime numbers.
As of June 25, 2010, it is not known if this conjecture is true or false, although most mathematicians believe it to be true.

certain equations. In such instances, we give the equation a special name.

8.3. Linear Diophantine Equations

441

Definition. An equation whose solutions are required to be integers is called
a Diophantine equation.
Diophantine equations are named in honor of the Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria (circa 300 c.e.). Very little is known about Diophantus‚Äô life
except that he probably lived in Alexandria in the early part of the fourth century
c.e. and was probably the first to use letters for unknown quantities in arithmetic problems. His most famous work, Arithmetica, consists of approximately
130 problems and their solutions. Most of these problems involved solutions of
equations in various numbers of variables. It is interesting to note that Diophantus
did not restrict his solutions to the integers but recognized rational number solutions as well. Today, however, the solutions for a so-called Diophantine equation
must be integers.
Definition. If a and b are integers with a ¬§ 0, then the equation ax D b is a
linear Diophantine equation in one variable.
Theorem 8.18 in Preview Activity 1 provides us with results that allows us to
determine which linear diophantine equations in one variable have solutions and
which ones do not have a solution.
A linear Diophantine equation in two variables can be defined in a manner
similar to the definition for a linear Diophantine equation in one variable.
Definition. Let a, b, and c be integers with a ¬§ 0 and b ¬§ 0. The Diophantine equation ax C by D c is called a linear Diophantine equation in two
variables.
The equations that were investigated in Preview Activity 2 were linear Diophantine equations in two variables. The problem of determining all the solutions
of a linear Diophantine equation has been completely solved. Before stating the
general result, we will provide a few more examples.
Example 8.19 (A Linear Diophantine Equation in Two Variables)
The following example is similar to the examples studied in Preview Activity 2.
We can use substitution to verify that x D 2 and y D

It would be nice to determine the pattern that these solutions exhibit. If we consider
the solution x D 2 and y D 1 to be the ‚Äústarting point,‚Äù then we can see that
the other solutions are obtained by adding 3 to x and subtracting 4 from y in the
previous solution. So we can write these solutions to the equation as
and

x D 2 C 3k

yD 1

4k;

where k is an integer. We can use substitution and algebra to verify that these
expressions for x and y give solutions of this equation as follows:
4x C 3y D 4 .2 C 3k/ C 3 . 1
D .8 C 12k/ C . 3

4k/
12k/

D 5:

We should note that we have not yet proved that these solutions are all of the
solutions of the Diophantine equation 4x C 3y D 5. This will be done later.
If the general form for a linear Diophantine equation is ax C by D c, then for
this example, a D 4 and b D 3. Notice that for this equation, we started with one
solution and obtained other solutions by adding b D 3 to x and subtracting a D 4
from y in the previous solution. Also, notice that gcd.3; 4/ D 1.

Do the solutions for the linear Diophantine equations in Preview Activity 2 show
the same type of pattern as the solutions for the linear Diophantine equations in
Example 8.19 and Progress Check 8.20? Explain.
The solutions for the linear Diophantine equations in Preview Activity 2, Example 8.19, and Progress Check 8.20 provide examples for the second part of Theorem 8.22.
Theorem 8.22. Let a, b, and c be integers with a ¬§ 0 and b ¬§ 0, and let
d D gcd.a; b/.
1. If d does not divide c, then the linear Diophantine equation ax C by D c
has no solution.
2. If d divides c, then the linear Diophantine equation ax C by D c has infinitely many solutions. In addition, if .x0 ; y0 / is a particular solution of this

Proof. The proof of Part (1) is Exercise (1). For Part (2), we let a, b, and c be
integers with a ¬§ 0 and b ¬§ 0, and let d D gcd.a; b/. We also assume that d j c.
Since d D gcd.a; b/, Theorem 8.8 tells us that d is a linear combination of a and
b. So there exist integers s and t such that
d D as C bt:

(1)

Since d j c, there exists an integer m such that c D d m. We can now multiply
both sides of equation (1) by m and obtain
d m D .as C bt /m

c D a.sm/ C b.t m/:

This means that x D sm, y D t m is a solution of ax C by D c, and we have
proved that the Diophantine equation ax C by D c has at least one solution.

Explorations and Activities
11. Linear Congruences in One Variable. Let n be a natural number and let
a; b 2 Z with a ¬§ 0. A congruence of the form ax  b .mod n/ is called a
linear congruence in one variable. This is called a linear congruence since
the variable x occurs to the first power.
A solution of a linear congruence in one variable is defined similarly to
the solution of an equation. A solution is an integer that makes the resulting congruence true when the integer is substituted for the variable x. For
example,
 The integer x D 3 is a solution for the congruence 2x  1 .mod 5/
since 2  3  1 .mod 5/ is a true congruence.

 The integer x D 7 is not a solution for the congruence 3x  1 .mod 6/

that there exists a bijection from the set A onto the set B. In this case, we write
A  B.

with the set B and that the set A has the same cardinality as the set B.
Note: When A is not equivalent to B, we write A 6 B.

(c) For all sets A, B, and C , if A  B and B  C , then A  C .

Equivalent Sets
In Preview Activity 1, we introduced the concept of equivalent sets. The motivation for this definition was to have a formal method for determining whether or not
two sets ‚Äúhave the same number of elements.‚Äù This idea was described in terms of
a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) from one set onto the other set. This idea
may seem simple for finite sets, but as we will see, this idea has surprising consequences when we deal with infinite sets. (We will soon provide precise definitions
for finite and infinite sets.)
Technical Note: The three properties we proved in Theorem 9.1 in Preview Activity 2 are very similar to the concepts of reflexive, symmetric, and transitive relations. However, we do not consider equivalence of sets to be an equivalence

454

Chapter 9. Finite and Infinite Sets

relation on a set U since an equivalence relation requires an underlying (universal)
set U . In this case, our elements would be the sets A, B, and C , and these would
then have to be subsets of some universal set W (elements of the power set of W ).
For equivalence of sets, we are not requiring that the sets A, B, and C be subsets
of the same universal set. So we do not use the term relation in regards to the
equivalence of sets. However, if A and B are sets and A  B, then we often say
that A and B are equivalent sets.
Progress Check 9.2 (Examples of Equivalent Sets)
We will use the definition of equivalent sets from in Preview Activity 1 in all parts
of this progress check. It is no longer sufficient to say that two sets are equivalent
by simply saying that the two sets have the same number of elements.

1. Let A D f1; 2; 3; : : : ; 99; 100g and let B D f351; 352; 353; : : : ; 449; 450g.
Define f W A ! B by f .x/ D x C 350, for each x in A. Prove that f is a
bijection from the set A to the set B and hence, A  B.
2. Let E be the set of all even integers and let D be the set of all odd integers.
Prove that E  D by proving that F W E ! D, where F .x/ D x C 1, for
all x 2 E, is a bijection.
3. Let .0; 1/ be the open interval of real numbers between 0 and 1. Similarly, if
b 2 R with b > 0, let .0; b/ be the open interval of real numbers between 0
and b.
Prove that the function f W .0; 1/ ! .0; b/ by f .x/ D bx, for all x 2 .0; 1/,
is a bijection and hence .0; 1/  .0; b/.

In Part (3) of Progress Check 9.2, notice that if b > 1, then .0; 1/ is a proper
subset of .0; b/ and .0; 1/  .0; b/.
Also, in Part (3) of Preview Activity 1, we proved that the set D of all odd
natural numbers is equivalent to N, and we know that D is a proper subset of N.
These results may seem a bit strange, but they are logical consequences of
the definition of equivalent sets. Although we have not defined the terms yet, we
will see that one thing that will distinguish an infinite set from a finite set is that
an infinite set can be equivalent to one of its proper subsets, whereas a finite set
cannot be equivalent to one of its proper subsets.

9.1. Finite Sets

455

Finite Sets
In Section 5.1, we defined the cardinality of a finite set A, denoted by card .A/,
to be the number of elements in the set A. Now that we know about functions and
bijections, we can define this concept more formally and more rigorously. First,
for each k 2 N, we define Nk to be the set of all natural numbers between 1 and k,
inclusive. That is,
Nk D f1; 2; : : : ; kg:
We will use the concept of equivalent sets introduced in Preview Activity 1 to
define a finite set.
Definition. A set A is a finite set provided that A D ; or there exists a natural
number k such that A  Nk . A set is an infinite set provided that it is not a
finite set.
If A  Nk , we say that the set A has cardinality k (or cardinal number k),
and we write card .A/ D k.
In addition, we say that the empty set has cardinality 0 (or cardinal number
0), and we write card .;/ D 0.
Notice that by this definition, the empty set is a finite set. In addition, for each
k 2 N, the identity function on Nk is a bijection and hence, by definition, the set
Nk is a finite set with cardinality k.
Theorem 9.3. Any set equivalent to a finite nonempty set A is a finite set and has
the same cardinality as A.
Proof. Suppose that A is a finite nonempty set, B is a set, and A  B. Since A
is a finite set, there exists a k 2 N such that A  Nk . We also have assumed that
A  B and so by part (b) of Theorem 9.1 (in Preview Activity 2), we can conclude
that B  A. Since A  Nk , we can use part (c) of Theorem 9.1 to conclude that
B  Nk . Thus, B is finite and has the same cardinality as A.

It may seem that we have done a lot of work to prove an ‚Äúobvious‚Äù result in
Theorem 9.3. The same may be true of the remaining results in this section, which
give further results about finite sets. One of the goals is to make sure that the concept of cardinality for a finite set corresponds to our intuitive notion of the number
of elements in the set. Another important goal is to lay the groundwork for a more
rigorous and mathematical treatment of infinite sets than we have encountered before. Along the way, we will see the mathematical distinction between finite and
infinite sets.

456

Chapter 9. Finite and Infinite Sets

The following two lemmas will be used to prove the theorem that states that
every subset of a finite set is finite.
Lemma 9.4. If A is a finite set and x ‚Ä¶ A, then A [ fxg is a finite set and
card.A [ fxg/ D card.A/ C 1.
Proof. Let A be a finite set and assume card.A/ D k, where k D 0 or k 2 N.
Assume x ‚Ä¶ A.
If A D ;, then card.A/ D 0 and A [ fxg D fxg, which is equivalent to N1 .
Thus, A [ fxg is finite with cardinality 1, which equals card.A/ C 1.
If A ¬§ ;, then A  Nk , for some k 2 N. This means that card.A/ D k, and
there exists a bijection f W A ! Nk . We will now use this bijection to define a
function g W A [ fxg ! NkC1 and then prove that the function g is a bijection. We
define g W A [ fxg ! NkC1 as follows: For each t 2 A [ fxg,
g .t / D

(

f .t / if t 2 A
k C 1 if t D x:

To prove that g is an injection, we let x1 ; x2 2 A [ fxg and assume x1 ¬§ x2 .
 If x1 ; x2 2 A, then since f is a bijection, f .x1 / ¬§ f .x2 /, and this implies
that g.x1 / ¬§ g.x2 /.
 If x1 D x, then since x2 ¬§ x1 , we conclude that x2 ¬§ x and hence x2 2 A.
So g.x1 / D k C 1, and since f .x2 / 2 Nk and g.x2 / D f .x2 /, we can
conclude that g.x1 / ¬§ g.x2 /.
This proves that the function g is an injection. The proof that g is a surjection is
Exercise (1). Since g is a bijection, we conclude that A [ fxg  NkC1 , and
card.A [ fxg/ D k C 1:
Since card .A/ D k, we have proved that card.A [ fxg/ D card.A/ C 1:



Lemma 9.5. For each natural number m, if A  Nm , then A is a finite set and
card .A/  m.
Proof. We will use a proof using induction on m. For each m 2 N, let P .m/ be,
‚ÄúIf A  Nm , then A is finite and card.A/  m.‚Äù

9.1. Finite Sets

457

We first prove that P .1/ is true. If A  N1 , then A D ; or A D f1g, both
of which are finite and have cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of N1 .
This proves that P .1/ is true.
For the inductive step, let k 2 N and assume that P .k/ is true. That is, assume
that if B  Nk , then B is a finite set and card.B/  k. We need to prove that
P .k C 1/ is true.
So assume that A is a subset of NkC1 . Then A
Since P .k/ is true, A fk C 1g is a finite set and
card.A

fk C 1g is a subset of Nk .

fk C 1g/  k:

There are two cases to consider: Either k C 1 2 A or k C 1 62 A.
If k C 1 62 A, then A D A

fk C 1g. Hence, A is finite and

card.A/  k < k C 1:
If k C 1 2 A, then A D .A fk C 1g/ [ fk C 1g. Hence, by Lemma 9.4, A is
a finite set and
card.A/ D card.A fk C 1g/ C 1:
Since card.A

fk C 1g/  k, we can conclude that card.A/  k C 1.

This means that we have proved the inductive step. Hence, by mathematical
induction, for each m 2 N, if A  Nm , then A is finite and card.A/  m.

The preceding two lemmas were proved to aid in the proof of the following
theorem.
Theorem 9.6. If S is a finite set and A is a subset of S , then A is a finite set and
card.A/  card.S /.
Proof. Let S be a finite set and assume that A is a subset of S . If A D ;, then A
is a finite set and card.A/  card.S /. So we assume that A ¬§ ;.
Since S is finite, there exists a bijection f W S ! Nk for some k 2 N. In this
case, card.S / D k. We need to show that A is equivalent to a finite set. To do this,
we define g W A ! f .A/ by
g.x/ D f .x/ for each x 2 A.

458

Chapter 9. Finite and Infinite Sets

Since f is an injection, we conclude that g is an injection. Now let y 2 f .A/.
Then there exists an a 2 A such that f .a/ D y. But by the definition of g, this
means that g.a/ D y, and hence g is a surjection. This proves that g is a bijection.
Hence, we have proved that A  f .A/. Since f .A/ is a subset of Nk , we use
Lemma 9.5 to conclude that f .A/ is finite and card.f .A//  k. In addition, by
Theorem 9.3, A is a finite set and card.A/ D card.f .A//. This proves that A is a
finite set and card.A/  card.S /.

Lemma 9.4 implies that adding one element to a finite set increases its cardinality by 1. It is also true that removing one element from a finite nonempty set
reduces the cardinality by 1. The proof of Corollary 9.7 is Exercise (4).
Corollary 9.7. If A is a finite set and x 2 A, then A
card.A fxg/ D card.A/ 1.

fxg is a finite set and

The next corollary will be used in the next section to provide a mathematical
distinction between finite and infinite sets.
Corollary 9.8. A finite set is not equivalent to any of its proper subsets.
Proof. Let B be a finite set and assume that A is a proper subset of B. Since A is
a proper subset of B, there exists an element x in B A. This means that A is a
subset of B fxg. Hence, by Theorem 9.6,
card.A/  card.B

fxg/ :

Also, by Corollary 9.7
card.B

fxg/ D card.B/

Hence, we may conclude that card.A/  card.B/

1:
1 and that

card.A/ < card.B/:
Theorem 9.3 implies that B 6 A. This proves that a finite set is not equivalent to
any of its proper subsets.

The Pigeonhole Principle
The last property of finite sets that we will consider in this section is often called
the Pigeonhole Principle. The ‚Äúpigeonhole‚Äù version of this property says, ‚ÄúIf m
pigeons go into r pigeonholes and m > r, then at least one pigeonhole has more
than one pigeon.‚Äù
In this situation, we can think of the set of pigeons as being equivalent to a
set P with cardinality m and the set of pigeonholes as being equivalent to a set
H with cardinality r. We can then define a function f W P ! H that maps each
pigeon to its pigeonhole. The Pigeonhole Principle states that this function is not
an injection. (It is not one-to-one since there are at least two pigeons ‚Äúmapped‚Äù to
the same pigeonhole.)
Theorem 9.9 (The Pigeonhole Principle). Let A and B be finite sets. If card.A/ >
card.B/, then any function f W A ! B is not an injection.
Proof. Let A and B be finite sets. We will prove the contrapositive of the theorem,
which is, if there exists a function f W A ! B that is an injection, then card.A/ 
card.B/.
So assume that f W A ! B is an injection. As in Theorem 9.6, we define a
function g W A ! f .A/ by
g.x/ D f .x/ for each x 2 A.
As we saw in Theorem 9.6, the function g is a bijection. But then A  f .A/ and
f .A/  B. Hence,
card.A/ D card.f .A// and card.f .A//  card.B/.
Hence, card.A/  card.B/, and this proves the contrapositive. Hence, if card.A/ >
card.B/, then any function f W A ! B is not an injection.

The Pigeonhole Principle has many applications in the branch of mathematics
called ‚Äúcombinatorics.‚Äù Some of these will be explored in the exercises.

Hint: Since B is finite, there exists a natural number m such that Nm  B.
This means there exists a bijection k W Nm ! B. Now let h D k ƒ± g, where

Countable Sets

Preview Activity 1 (Introduction to Infinite Sets)
In Section 9.1, we defined a finite set to be the empty set or a set A such that
A  Nk for some natural number k. We also defined an infinite set to be a set that
is not finite, but the question now is, ‚ÄúHow do we know if a set is infinite?‚Äù One
way to determine if a set is an infinite set is to use Corollary 9.8, which states that
a finite set is not equivalent to any of its subsets. We can write this as a conditional
statement as follows:
If A is a finite set, then A is not equivalent to any of its proper subsets.
or more formally as
For each set A, if A is a finite set, then for each proper subset B of A, A 6 B.
1. Write the contrapositive of the preceding conditional statement. Then explain how this statement can be used to determine if a set is infinite.
2. Let D C be the set of all odd natural numbers. In Preview Activity 1 from
Section 9.1, we proved that N  D C .
(a) Use this to explain carefully why N is an infinite set.
(b) Is D C a finite set or an infinite set? Explain carefully how you know.
3. Let b be a positive real number. Let .0; 1/ and .0; b/ be the open intervals
from 0 to 1 and 0 to b, respectively. In Part (3) of Progress Check 9.2 (on
page 454), we proved that .0; 1/  .0; b/.
(a) Use a value for b where 0 < b < 1 to explain why .0; 1/ is an infinite
set.
(b) Use a value for b where b > 1 to explain why .0; b/ is an infinite set.

odd.

(c) Determine the value of n so that f .n/ D 1000.
In this section, we will describe several infinite sets and define the cardinal
number for so-called countable sets. Most of our examples will be subsets of some
of our standard numbers systems such as N, Z, and Q.

Infinite Sets
In Preview Activity 1, we saw how to use Corollary 9.8 to prove that a set is infinite.
This corollary implies that if A is a finite set, then A is not equivalent to any of its
proper subsets. By writing the contrapositive of this conditional statement, we can
restate Corollary 9.8 in the following form:
Corollary 9.8 If a set A is equivalent to one of its proper subsets, then A is infinite.
In Preview Activity 1, we used Corollary 9.8 to prove that
 The set of natural numbers, N, is an infinite set.
 The open interval .0; 1/ is an infinite set.
Although Corollary 9.8 provides one way to prove that a set is infinite, it is sometimes more convenient to use a proof by contradiction to prove that a set is infinite.
The idea is to use results from Section 9.1 about finite sets to help obtain a contradiction. This is illustrated in the next theorem.
Theorem 9.10. Let A and B be sets.
1. If A is infinite and A  B, then B is infinite.
2. If A is infinite and A  B, then B is infinite.
Proof. We will prove part (1). The proof of part (2) is exercise (3) on page 473.

9.2. Countable Sets

465

To prove part (1), we use a proof by contradiction and assume that A is an
infinite set, A  B, and B is not infinite. That is, B is a finite set. Since A  B
and B is finite, Theorem 9.3 on page 455 implies that A is a finite set. This is a
contradiction to the assumption that A is infinite. We have therefore proved that if
A is infinite and A  B, then B is infinite.

Progress Check 9.11 (Examples of Infinite Sets)
1. In Preview Activity 1, we used Corollary 9.8 to prove that N is an infinite
set. Now use this and Theorem 9.10 to explain why our standard number
systems .Z; Q; and R/ are infinite sets. Also, explain why the set of all
positive rational numbers, QC , and the set of all positive real numbers, RC ,
are infinite sets.
2. Let D C be the set of all odd natural numbers. In Part (2) of Preview Activity 1, we proved that D C  N. Use Theorem 9.10 to explain why D C is an
infinite set.
3. Prove that the set E C of all even natural numbers is an infinite set.

Countably Infinite Sets
In Section 9.1, we used the set Nk as the standard set with cardinality k in the sense
that a set is finite if and only if it is equivalent to Nk . In a similar manner, we will
use some infinite sets as standard sets for certain infinite cardinal numbers. The
first set we will use is N.
We will formally define what it means to say the elements of a set can be
‚Äúcounted‚Äù using the natural numbers. The elements of a finite set can be ‚Äúcounted‚Äù
by defining a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the set and Nk for
some natural number k. We will be able to ‚Äúcount‚Äù the elements of an infinite set
if we can define a one-to-one correspondence between the set and N.
Definition. The cardinality of N is denoted by @0 . The symbol @ is the first
letter of the Hebrew alphabet, aleph. The subscript 0 is often read as ‚Äúnaught‚Äù
(or sometimes as ‚Äúzero‚Äù or ‚Äúnull‚Äù). So we write
card.N/ D @0
and say that the cardinality of N is ‚Äúaleph naught.‚Äù

466

Chapter 9. Finite and Infinite Sets

Definition. A set A is countably infinite provided that A  N. In this case,
we write
card.A/ D @0 :
A set that is countably infinite is sometimes called a denumerable set. A set
is countable provided that it is finite or countably infinite. An infinite set that
is not countably infinite is called an uncountable set.
Progress Check 9.12 (Examples of Countably Infinite Sets)
1. In Preview Activity 1 from Section 9.1, we proved that N  D C , where D C
is the set of all odd natural numbers. Explain why card.D C / D @0 .
2. Use a result from Progress Check 9.11 to explain why card.E C / D @0 .
3. At this point, if we wish to prove a set S is countably infinite, we must find
a bijection between the set S and some set that is known to be countably
infinite.
Let S be the set of all natural numbers that are perfect squares. Define a
function
f WS ! N
that can be used to prove that S  N and, hence, that card.S / D @0 .
The fact that the set of integers is a countably infinite set is important enough to
be called a theorem. The function we will use to establish that N  Z was explored
in Preview Activity 2.
Theorem 9.13. The set Z of integers is countably infinite, and so card.Z/ D @0 .
Proof. To prove that N  Z, we will use the following function: f W N ! Z,
where

From our work in Preview Activity 2, it appears that if n is an even natural number,
then f .n/ > 0, and if n is an odd natural number, then f .n/  0. So it seems
reasonable to use cases to prove that f is a surjection and that f is an injection.
To prove that f is a surjection, we let y 2 Z.

9.2. Countable Sets

These two cases prove that if y 2 Z, then there exists an n 2 N such that
f .n/ D y. Hence, f is a surjection.
To prove that f is an injection, we let m; n 2 N and assume that f .m/ D f .n/.
First note that if one of m and n is odd and the other is even, then one of f .m/ and
f .n/ is positive and the other is less than or equal to 0. So if f .m/ D f .n/, then
both m and n must be even or both m and n must be odd.
 If both m and n are even, then
f .m/ D f .n/ implies that

m

and hence that m D n.
 If both m and n are odd, then
f .m/ D f .n/ implies that

From this, we conclude that 1 m = 1 n and hence that m D n. This
proves that if f .m/ D f .n/, then m D n and hence that f is an injection.
Since f is both a surjection and an injection, we see that f is a bijection and,
therefore, N  Z. Hence, Z is countably infinite and card.Z/ D @0 .

The result in Theorem 9.13 can seem a bit surprising. It exhibits one of the
distinctions between finite and infinite sets. If we add elements to a finite set, we
will increase its size in the sense that the new set will have a greater cardinality
than the old set. However, with infinite sets, we can add elements and the new
set may still have the same cardinality as the original set. For example, there is a
one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the sets N and Z. We say that
these sets have the same cardinality.
Following is a summary of some of the main examples dealing with the cardinality of sets that we have explored.

468

Chapter 9. Finite and Infinite Sets

 The sets Nk , where k 2 N, are examples of sets that are countable and finite.
 The sets N, Z, the set of all odd natural numbers, and the set of all even natural numbers are examples of sets that are countable and countably infinite.
 We have not yet proved that any set is uncountable.

The Set of Positive Rational Numbers
If we expect to find an uncountable set in our usual number systems, the rational
numbers might be the place to start looking. One of the main differences between
the set of rational numbers and the integers is that given any integer m, there is a
next integer, namely m C 1. This is not true for the set of rational numbers. We
know that Q is closed under division (by nonzero rational numbers) and we will
see that this property implies that given any two rational numbers, we can also find
a rational number between them. In fact, between any two rational numbers, we
can find infinitely many rational numbers. It is this property that may lead us to
believe that there are ‚Äúmore‚Äù rational numbers than there are integers.
The basic idea will be to ‚Äúgo half way‚Äù between two rational numbers. For
1

example, if we use a D and b D , we can use



aCb

as a rational number between a and b. We can then repeat this process to find a
5

rational number between
and .
12
2
So we will now let a and b be any two rational numbers with a < b and let
aCb

Since b > a, we see that b a > 0 and so the previous equations show that
c1 a > 0 and b c1 > 0. We can then conclude that a < c1 < b.

9.2. Countable Sets

c1 C b
and proving that c1 <

c2 < b. In fact, for each natural number, we can define
We can now repeat this process by using c2 D

and obtain the result that a < c1 < c2 <    < cn <    < b and this proves
that the set fck j k 2 Ng is a countably infinite set where each element is a rational
number between a and b. (A formal proof can be completed using mathematical
induction. See Exercise ().
This result is true no matter how close together a and b are. For example,
we can now conclude that there are infinitely many rational numbers between 0
1
. This might suggest that the set Q of rational numbers is uncountable.
and
10000
Surprisingly, this is not the case. We start with a proof that the set of positive
rational numbers is countable.
Theorem 9.14. The set of positive rational numbers is countably infinite.
Proof. We can write all the positive rational numbers in a two-dimensional array
as shown in Figure 9.2. The top row in Figure 9.2 represents the numerator of the
rational number, and the left column represents the denominator. We follow the
arrows in Figure 9.2 to define f W N ! QC . The idea is to start in the upper left
corner of the table and move to successive diagonals as follows:
 We startwith allfractions in which the sum of the numerator and denomina1

. So f .1/ D .

 We next use those fractions in which the sum of the numerator and denomi2

 We next use those fractions in which the sum of the numerator and denom1

3

2
2
1
way, we will ensure that the function f is a one-to-one function.
We now continue with successive diagonals omitting fractions that are not in lowest terms. This process guarantees that the function f will be an injection and a
surjection. Therefore, N  QC and card.QC / D @0 .

Figure 9.2: Counting the Positive Rational Numbers

Since QC is countable, it seems reasonable to expect that Q is countable. We will
explore this soon. On the other hand, at this point, it may also seem reasonable to
ask,
‚ÄúAre there any uncountable sets?‚Äù
The answer to this question is yes, but we will wait until the next section to prove
that certain sets are uncountable. We still have a few more issues to deal with
concerning countable sets.

Countably Infinite Sets
Theorem 9.15. If A is a countably infinite set, then A [ fxg is a countably infinite
set.
Proof. Let A be a countably infinite set. Then there exists a bijection f W N ! A.
Since x is either in A or not in A, we can consider two cases.

9.2. Countable Sets

471

If x 2 A, then A [ fxg D A and A [ fxg is countably infinite.
If x ‚Ä¶ A, define g W N ! A [ fxg by
(
x
g.n/ D
f .n

if n D 1
1/ if n > 1.

The proof that the function g is a bijection is Exercise (4). Since g is a bijection,
we have proved that A [ fxg  N and hence, A [ fxg is countably infinite.

Theorem 9.16. If A is a countably infinite set and B is a finite set, then A [ B is
a countably infinite set.
Proof. Exercise (5) on page 473.



Theorem 9.16 says that if we add a finite number of elements to a countably infinite set, the resulting set is still countably infinite. In other words, the cardinality
of the new set is the same as the cardinality of the original set. Finite sets behave
very differently in the sense that if we add elements to a finite set, we will change
the cardinality. What may even be more surprising is the result in Theorem 9.17
that states that the union of two countably infinite (disjoint) sets is countably infinite. The proof of this result is similar to the proof that the integers are countably
infinite (Theorem 9.13). In fact, if A D fa1 ; a2 ; a3 ; : : :g and B D fb1 ; b2 ; b3 ; : : :g,
then we can use the following diagram to help define a bijection from N to A [ B.

It is left as Exercise (6) on page 474 to prove that the function h is a bijection. 
Since we can write the set of rational numbers Q as the union of the set of nonnegative rational numbers and the set of rational numbers, we can use the results in
Theorem 9.14, Theorem 9.15, and Theorem 9.17 to prove the following theorem.
Theorem 9.18. The set Q of all rational numbers is countably infinite.
Proof. Exercise (7) on page 474.



In Section 9.1, we proved that any subset of a finite set is finite (Theorem 9.6).
A similar result should be expected for countable sets. We first prove that every
subset of N is countable. For an infinite subset B of N, the idea of the proof is to
define a function g W N ! B by removing the elements from B from smallest to the
next smallest to the next smallest, and so on. We do this by defining the function g
recursively as follows:
 Let g.1/ be the smallest natural number in B.
 Remove g.1/ from B and let g.2/ be the smallest natural number in
B fg.1/g.
 Remove g.2/ and let g.3/ be the smallest natural number in
B fg.1/; g.2/g.
 We continue this process. The formal recursive definition of g W N ! B is
included in the proof of Theorem 9.19.
Theorem 9.19. Every subset of the natural numbers is countable.
Proof. Let B be a subset of N. If B is finite, then B is countable. So we next
assume that B is infinite. We will next give a recursive definition of a function
g W N ! B and then prove that g is a bijection.
 Let g.1/ be the smallest natural number in B.
 For each n 2 N, the set B fg.1/; g.2/; : : : ; g.n/g is not empty since B is infinite.
Define g.n C 1/ to be the smallest natural number in
B fg.1/; g.2/; : : : ; g.n/g.
The proof that the function g is a bijection is Exercise (11) on page 474.

Preview Activity 1 (The Game of Dodge Ball)
(From The Heart of Mathematics: An Invitation to Effective Thinking by Edward
B. Burger and Michael Starbird, Key Publishing Company, c 2000 by Edward B.
Burger and Michael Starbird.)
Dodge Ball is a game for two players. It is played on a game board such as
the one shown in Figure 9.4. Player One has a 6 by 6 array to complete and Player
Two has a 1 by 6 row to complete. Each player has six turns as described next.
 Player One begins by filling in the first horizontal row of his or her table with
a sequence of six X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs, one in each square in the first row.
 Then Player Two places either an X or an O in the first box of his or her row.
At this point, Player One has completed the first row and Player Two has
filled in the first box of his or her row with one letter.
 The game continues with Player One completing a row with six letters (X‚Äôs
and O‚Äôs), one in each box of the next row followed by Player Two writing
one letter (an X or an O) in the next box of his or her row. The game is
completed when Player One has completed all six rows and Player Two has
completed all six boxes in his or her row.

Winning the Game
 Player One wins if any horizontal row in the 6 by 6 array is identical to the
row that Player Two created. (Player One matches Player Two.)
 Player Two wins if Player Two‚Äôs row of six letters is different than each of
the six rows produced by Player One. (Player Two ‚Äúdodges‚Äù Player One.)

Preview Activity 2 (Functions from a Set to Its Power Set)
Let A be a set. In Section 5.1, we defined the power set P.A/ of A to be the set of
all subsets of A. This means that
X 2 P.A/ if and only if X  A.
Theorem 5.5 in Section 5.1 states that if a set A has n elements, then A has 2n
subsets or that P.A/ has 2n elements. Using our current notation for cardinality,
this means that
if card.A/ D n, then card.P.A// D 2n .
(The proof of this theorem was Exercise (17) on page 229.)
We are now going to define and explore some functions from a set A to its
power set P.A/. This means that the input of the function will be an element of A
and the output of the function will be a subset of A.

We have seen examples of sets that are countably infinite, but we have not
yet seen an example of an infinite set that is uncountable. We will do so in this
section. The first example of an uncountable set will be the open interval of real
numbers .0; 1/. The proof that this interval is uncountable uses a method similar
to the winning strategy for Player Two in the game of Dodge Ball from Preview
Activity 1. Before considering the proof, we need to state an important results
about decimal expressions for real numbers.

Decimal Expressions for Real Numbers
In its decimal form, any real number a in the interval .0; 1/ can be written as
a D 0:a1 a2 a3 a4 : : : ; where each ai is an integer with 0  ai  9. For example,
5
D 0:416666 : : : :
12

480

Chapter 9. Finite and Infinite Sets

5
D 0:416 to indicate that the 6 is repeated. We can
12
5
also repeat a block of digits. For example,
D 0:19230769 to indicate that the
26
block 230769 repeats. That is,
We often abbreviate this as

5
D 0:19230769230769230769 : : : :
26
There is only one situation in which a real number can be represented as a decimal
in more than one way. A decimal that ends with an infinite string of 9‚Äôs is equal to
one that ends with an infinite string of 0‚Äôs. For example, 0:3199999 : : : represents
the same real number as 0:3200000 : : : : Geometric series can be used to prove that
a decimal that ends with an infinite string of 9‚Äôs is equal to one that ends with an
infinite string of 0‚Äôs, but we will not do so here.
Definition. A decimal representation of a real number a is in normalized
form provided that there is no natural number k such that for all natural numbers n with n > k, an D 9. That is, the decimal representation of a is in
normalized form if and only if it does not end with an infinite string of 9‚Äôs.

One reason the normalized form is important is the following theorem (which will
not be proved here).
Theorem 9.21. Two decimal numbers in normalized form are equal if and only if
they have identical digits in each decimal position.

Uncountable Subsets of R
In the proof that follows, we will use only the normalized form for the decimal
representation of a real number in the interval .0; 1/.
Theorem 9.22. The open interval .0; 1/ is an uncountable set.



1 1 1
Proof. Since the interval .0; 1/ contains the infinite subset
; ; ; : : : , we can
2 3 4
use Theorem 9.10, to conclude that .0; 1/ is an infinite set. So .0; 1/ is either countably infinite or uncountable. We will prove that .0; 1/ is uncountable by proving
that any function from N to .0; 1/ is not a surjection, and hence, there is no bijection
from N to .0; 1/.

9.3. Uncountable Sets

481

So suppose that f W N ! .0; 1/ is a function. We will show that f is not a
surjection by showing that there exists an element in .0; 1/ that cannot be in the
range of f . Writing the images of the elements of N in normalized form, we can
write
f .1/ D 0:a11 a12 a13 a14 a15 : : :
f .2/ D 0:a21 a22 a23 a24 a25 : : :

f .3/ D 0:a31 a32 a33 a34 a35 : : :

f .4/ D 0:a41 a42 a43 a44 a45 : : :

f .5/ D 0:a51 a52 a53 a54 a55 : : :
::
:

f .n/ D 0:an1 an2 an3 an4 an5 : : :
::
:
Notice the use of the double subscripts. The number aij is the j th digit to the right
of the decimal point in the normalized decimal representation of f .i /.
We will now construct a real number b D 0:b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 : : : in .0; 1/ and in
normalized form that is not in this list.
Note: The idea is to start in the upper left corner and move down the diagonal in
a manner similar to the winning strategy for Player Two in the game in Preview
Activity 1. At each step, we choose a digit that is not equal to the diagonal digit.
Start with a11 in f .1/. We want to choose b1 so that b1 ¬§ 0, b1 ¬§ a11 , and
b1 ¬§ 9. (To ensure that we end up with a decimal that is in normalized form, we
make sure that each digit is not equal to 9.) We then repeat this process with a22 ,
a33 , a44 , a55 , and so on. So we let b be the real number b D 0:b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 : : : ;
where for each k 2 N
(
3 if akk ¬§ 3
bk D
5 if akk D 3.
(The choice of 3 and 5 is arbitrary. Other choices of distinct digits will also work.)
Now for each n 2 N, b ¬§ f .n/ since b and f .n/ are in normalized form and
b and f .n/ differ in the nth decimal place. Therefore, f is not a surjection. This
proves that any function from N to .0; 1/ is not a surjection and hence, there is
no bijection from N to .0; 1/. Therefore, .0; 1/ is not countably infinite and hence
must be an uncountable set.

Chapter 9. Finite and Infinite Sets

Progress Check 9.23 (Dodge Ball and Cantor‚Äôs Diagonal Argument)
The proof of Theorem 9.22 is often referred to as Cantor‚Äôs diagonal argument.
It is named after the mathematician Georg Cantor, who first published the proof
in 1874. Explain the connection between the winning strategy for Player Two in
Dodge Ball (see Preview Activity 1) and the proof of Theorem 9.22 using Cantor‚Äôs
diagonal argument.
The open interval .0; 1/ is our first example of an uncountable set. The cardinal
number of .0; 1/ is defined to be c, which stands for the cardinal number of
the continuum. So the two infinite cardinal numbers we have seen are @0 for
countably infinite sets and c.
Definition. A set A is said to have cardinality c provided that A is equivalent
to .0; 1/. In this case, we write card.A/ D c and say that the cardinal number
of A is c.
The proof of Theorem 9.24 is included in Progress Check 9.25.
Theorem 9.24. Let a and b be real numbers with a < b. The open interval .a; b/
is uncountable and has cardinality c.
Progress Check 9.25 (Proof of Theorem 9.24)
1. In Part (3) of Progress Check 9.2, we proved that if b 2 R and b > 0, then
the open interval .0; 1/ is equivalent to the open interval .0; b/. Now let a
and b be real numbers with a < b. Find a function
f W .0; 1/ ! .a; b/
that is a bijection and conclude that .0; 1/  .a; b/.

Hint: Find a linear function that passes through the points .0; a/ and .1; b/.
Use this to define the function f . Make sure you prove that this function f
is a bijection.

2. Let a; b; c; d be real numbers with a < b and c < d .
.a; b/  .c; d /.

Cantor‚Äôs Theorem
We have now seen two different infinite cardinal numbers, @0 and c. It can seem
surprising that there is more than one infinite cardinal number. A reasonable question at this point is, ‚ÄúAre there any other infinite cardinal numbers?‚Äù The astonishing answer is that there are, and in fact, there are infinitely many different infinite
cardinal numbers. The basis for this fact is the following theorem, which states that
a set is not equivalent to its power set. The proof is due to Georg Cantor (1845‚Äì
1918), and the idea for this proof was explored in Preview Activity 2. The basic
idea of the proof is to prove that any function from a set A to its power set cannot
be a surjection.
Theorem 9.27 (Cantor‚Äôs Theorem). For every set A, A and P.A/ do not have
the same cardinality.
Proof. Let A be a set. If A D ;, then P.A/ D f;g, which has cardinality 1.
Therefore, ; and P.;/ do not have the same cardinality.
Now suppose that A ¬§ ;, and let f W A ! P.A/. We will show that f cannot
be a surjection, and hence there is no bijection from A to P.A/. This will prove
that A is not equivalent to P.A/. Define
S D fx 2 A j x ‚Ä¶ f .x/g :
Assume that there exists a t in A such that f .t / D S . Now, either t 2 S or t ‚Ä¶ S .
 If t 2 S , then t 2 fx 2 A j x ‚Ä¶ f .x/g. By the definition of S , this means
that t ‚Ä¶ f .t /. However, f .t / D S and so we conclude that t ‚Ä¶ S . But now
we have t 2 S and t ‚Ä¶ S . This is a contradiction.
 If t ‚Ä¶ S , then t ‚Ä¶ fx 2 A j x ‚Ä¶ f .x/g. By the definition of S , this means
that t 2 f .t /. However, f .t / D S and so we conclude that t 2 S . But now
we have t ‚Ä¶ S and t 2 S . This is a contradiction.
So in both cases we have arrived at a contradiction. This means that there does not
exist a t in A such that f .t / D S . Therefore, any function from A to P.A/ is not
a surjection and hence not a bijection. Hence, A and P.A/ do not have the same
cardinality.

Corollary 9.28. P.N/ is an infinite set that is not countably infinite.

484

Chapter 9. Finite and Infinite Sets

Proof. Since P.N/ contains the infinite subset ff1g ; f2g ; f3g : : : g, we can use Theorem 9.10, to conclude that P.N/ is an infinite set. By Cantor‚Äôs Theorem (Theorem 9.27), N and P.N/ do not have the same cardinality. Therefore, P.N/ is not
countable and hence is an uncountable set.


Some Final Comments about Uncountable Sets
1. We have now seen that any open interval of real numbers is uncountable and
has cardinality c. In addition, R is uncountable and has cardinality c. Now,
Corollary 9.28 tells us that P.N/ is uncountable. A question that can be
asked is,
‚ÄúDoes P.N/ have the same cardinality as R?‚Äù
The answer is yes, although we are not in a position to prove it yet. A
proof of this fact uses the following theorem, which is known as the CantorSchroÃàder-Bernstein Theorem.
Theorem 9.29 (Cantor-SchroÃàder-Bernstein). Let A and B be sets. If there exist
injections f W A ! B and g W B ! A, then A  B.
In the statement of this theorem, notice that it is not required that the function g
be the inverse of the function f . We will not prove the Cantor-SchroÃàder-Bernstein
Theorem here. The following items will show some uses of this important theorem.
2. The Cantor-SchroÃàder-Bernstein Theorem can also be used to prove that the
closed interval ≈í0; 1¬ç is equivalent to the open interval .0; 1/. See Exercise (6)
on page 486.
3. Another question that was posed earlier is,
‚ÄúAre there other infinite cardinal numbers other than @0 and c?‚Äù
Again, the answer is yes, and the basis for this is Cantor‚Äôs Theorem (Theorem 9.27). We can start with card.N/ D @0 . We then define the following
infinite cardinal numbers:
card.P.N// D Àõ1 .
card.P.P.N/// D Àõ2 .

card.P.P.P.N//// D Àõ3 .
::
:

9.3. Uncountable Sets

485

Cantor‚Äôs Theorem tells us that these are all different cardinal numbers, and
so we are just using the lowercase Greek letter Àõ (alpha) to help give names
to these cardinal numbers. In fact, although we will not define it here, there
is a way to ‚Äúorder‚Äù these cardinal numbers in such a way that
@ 0 < Àõ1 < Àõ2 < Àõ3 <    :
Keep in mind, however, that even though these are different cardinal numbers, Cantor‚Äôs Theorem does not tell us that these are the only cardinal numbers.
4. In Comment (1), we indicated that P.N/ and R have the same cardinality.
Combining this with the notation in Comment (3), this means that
Àõ1 D c:
However, this does not necessarily mean that c is the ‚Äúnext largest‚Äù cardinal
number after @0 . A reasonable question is, ‚ÄúIs there an infinite set with
cardinality between @0 and c?‚Äù Rewording this in terms of the real number
line, the question is, ‚ÄúOn the real number line, is there an infinite set of
points that is not equivalent to the entire line and also not equivalent to the
set of natural numbers?‚Äù This question was asked by Cantor, but he was
unable to find any such set. He conjectured that no such set exists. That
is, he conjectured that c is really the next cardinal number after @0 . This
conjecture has come to be known as the Continuum Hypothesis. Stated
somewhat more formally, the Continuum Hypothesis is
There is no set X such that @0 < card.X / < c.
The question of whether the Continuum Hypothesis is true or false is one of
the most famous problems in modern mathematics.
Through the combined work of Kurt GoÃàdel in the 1930s and Paul Cohen in
1963, it has been proved that the Continuum Hypothesis cannot be proved or
disproved from the standard axioms of set theory. This means that either the
Continuum Hypothesis or its negation can be added to the standard axioms
of set theory without creating a contradiction.

where A is an integer and the decimal part .0:a1 a2 a3 a4    / is in normalized

Guidelines for Writing
Mathematical Proofs
One of the most important forms of mathematical writing is writing mathematical
proofs. The writing of mathematical proofs is an acquired skill and takes a lot
of practice. Throughout the textbook, we have introduced various guidelines for
writing proofs. These guidelines are in Sections 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 4.1.
Following is a summary of all the writing guidelines introduced in the text.
This summary contains some standard conventions that are usually followed when
writing a mathematical proof.
1. Know your audience. Every writer should have a clear idea of the intended
audience for a piece of writing. In that way, the writer can give the right
amount of information at the proper level of sophistication to communicate
effectively. This is especially true for mathematical writing. For example, if
a mathematician is writing a solution to a textbook problem for a solutions
manual for instructors, the writing would be brief with many details omitted.
However, if the writing was for a students‚Äô solution manual, more details
would be included.
2. Begin with a carefully worded statement of the theorem or result to be
proven. The statement should be a simple declarative statement of the problem. Do not simply rewrite the problem as stated in the textbook or given on
a handout. Problems often begin with phrases such as ‚ÄúShow that‚Äù or ‚ÄúProve
that.‚Äù This should be reworded as a simple declarative statement of the theorem. Then skip a line and write ‚ÄúProof‚Äù in italics or boldface font (when
492

Appendix A. Writing Guidelines

493

using a word processor). Begin the proof on the same line. Make sure that
all paragraphs can be easily identified. Skipping a line between paragraphs
or indenting each paragraph can accomplish this.
As an example, an exercise in a text might read, ‚ÄúProve that if x is an odd
integer, then x 2 is an odd integer.‚Äù This could be started as follows:
Theorem. If x is an odd integer, then x 2 is an odd integer.
Proof : We assume that x is an odd integer . . . .
3. Begin the proof with a statement of your assumptions. Follow the statement of your assumptions with a statement of what you will prove.
Proof. We assume that x and y are odd integers and will prove that x  y is
an odd integer.
4. Use the pronoun ‚Äúwe.‚Äù If a pronoun is used in a proof, the usual convention
is to use ‚Äúwe‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI.‚Äù The idea is to stress that you and the reader
are doing the mathematics together. It will help encourage the reader to
continue working through the mathematics. Notice that we started the proof
of Theorem 1.8 with ‚ÄúWe assume that : : : :‚Äù
5. Use italics for variables when using a word processor. When using a
word processor to write mathematics, the word processor needs to be capable of producing the appropriate mathematical symbols and equations. The
mathematics that is written with a word processor should look like typeset
mathematics. This means that variables need to be italicized, boldface is
used for vectors, and regular font is used for mathematical terms such as the
names of the trigonometric functions and logarithmic functions.
For example, we do not write sin x or si n x. The proper way to typeset this
is sin x.
6. Do not use  for multiplication or ÀÜ for exponents. Leave this type of
notation for writing computer code. The use of this notation makes it difficult
for humans to read. In addition, avoid using = for division when using a
complex fraction.

For example, it is very difficult to read x 3 3x 2 C 1=2 = .2x=3 7/; the
fraction
1
x 3 3x 2 C
2
2x
7
3
is much easier to read.

494

Appendix A. Writing Guidelines

7. Use complete sentences and proper paragraph structure. Good grammar
is an important part of any writing. Therefore, conform to the accepted rules
of grammar. Pay careful attention to the structure of sentences. Write proofs
using complete sentences but avoid run-on sentences. Also, do not forget
punctuation, and always use a spell checker when using a word processor.
8. Keep the reader informed. Sometimes a theorem is proven by proving the
contrapositive or by using a proof by contradiction. If either proof method
is used, this should be indicated within the first few lines of the proof. This
also applies if the result is going to be proven using mathematical induction.
Examples:
 We will prove this result by proving the contrapositive of the statement.
 We will prove this statement using a proof by contradiction.
 We will assume to the contrary that : : : :

 We will use mathematical induction to prove this result.
In addition, make sure the reader knows the status of every assertion that
is made. That is, make sure it is clearly stated whether an assertion is an
assumption of the theorem, a previously proven result, a well-known result,
or something from the reader‚Äôs mathematical background.
9. Display important equations and mathematical expressions. Equations
and manipulations are often an integral part of the exposition. Do not write
equations, algebraic manipulations, or formulas in one column with reasons
given in another column (as is often done in geometry texts). Important equations and manipulations should be displayed. This means that they should
be centered with blank lines before and after the equation or manipulations,
and if one side of an equation does not change, it should not be repeated. For
example,
Using algebra, we obtain

x  y D .2m C 1/ .2n C 1/

D 4mn C 2m C 2n C 1

D 2 .2mn C m C n/ C 1:

Since m and n are integers, we conclude that : : : :

Appendix A. Writing Guidelines

495

10. Equation numbering guidelines. If it is necessary to refer to an equation
later in a proof, that equation should be centered and displayed, and it should
be given a number. The number for the equation should be written in parentheses on the same line as the equation at the right-hand margin.
Example:
Since x is an odd integer, there exists an integer n such that
x D 2n C 1:

(1)

Later in the proof, there may be a line such as
Then, using the result in equation (1), we obtain : : : :
Please note that we should only number those equations we will be
referring to later in the proof. Also, note that the word ‚Äúequation‚Äù is not
capitalized when we are referring to an equation by number. Although it
may be appropriate to use a capital ‚ÄúE,‚Äù the usual convention in
mathematics is not to capitalize.
11. Do not use a mathematical symbol at the beginning of a sentence.
For example, we should not write, ‚ÄúLet n be an integer. n is an odd integer
provided that : : : :‚Äù Many people find this hard to read and often have to reread it to understand it. It would be better to write, ‚ÄúAn integer n is an odd
integer provided that : : : :‚Äù
12. Use English and minimize the use of cumbersome notation. Do not use
the special symbols for quantifiers 8 (for all), 9 (there exists), √ñ (such that),
or ) (therefore) in formal mathematical writing. It is often easier to write,
and usually easier to read, if the English words are used instead of the symbols. For example, why make the reader interpret
.8x 2 R/ .9y 2 R/ .x C y D 0/
when it is possible to write
For each real number x, there exists a real number y such that x C y D 0,
or more succinctly (if appropriate)
Every real number has an additive inverse.

496

Appendix A. Writing Guidelines

13. Tell the reader when the proof has been completed. Perhaps the best way
to do this is to say outright that, ‚ÄúThis completes the proof.‚Äù Although it
may seem repetitive, a good alternative is to finish a proof with a sentence
that states precisely what has been proven. In any case, it is usually good
practice to use some ‚Äúend of proof symbol‚Äù such as .
14. Keep it simple. It is often difficult to understand a mathematical argument
no matter how well it is written. Do not let your writing help make it more
difficult for the reader. Use simple, declarative sentences and short paragraphs, each with a simple point.
15. Write a first draft of your proof and then revise it. Remember that a proof
is written so that readers are able to read and understand the reasoning in the
proof. Be clear and concise. Include details but do not ramble. Do not be
satisfied with the first draft of a proof. Read it over and refine it. Just like
any worthwhile activity, learning to write mathematics well takes practice
and hard work. This can be frustrating. Everyone can be sure that there will
be some proofs that are difficult to construct, but remember that proofs are a
very important part of mathematics. So work hard and have fun.

also use x D 2 and y D 9. There are many other possible choices for x

3. This proposition appears to be true. Anytime we use an example where x is

that this is true based on examples since we cannot list all of the examples
where x is an even integer.
4. This proposition appears to be true. Anytime we use an example where x
and y are both integers, the number x  y is an odd integer. However, we
cannot claim that this is true based on examples since we cannot list all of
the examples where both x and y are odd integers.

(a) This does not mean the conditional statement is false since when x D

(c) All examples should indicate that the conditional statement is true.

So in the case where n D 41, the hypothesis is true (41 is a positive integer) and the conclusion is false 412 is not prime . Therefore, 41 is a counterexample that shows the conditional statement is false. There are other
counterexamples (such as n D 42, n D 45, and n D 50), but only one
counterexample is needed to prove that the statement is false.

1. We assume that x and y are even integers and will prove that x C y is an
even integer. Since x and y are even, there exist integers m and n such that
x D 2m and y D 2n. We can then conclude that
x C y D 2m C 2n

D 2.m C n/

Since the integers are closed under addition, m C n is an integer and the last
equation shows that x C y is an even integer. This proves that if x is an even
integer and y is an even integer, then x C y is an even integer.
The other two parts would be written in a similar manner as Part (1). Only the
algebraic details are shown below for (2) and (3).
2. If x is an even integer and y is an odd integer, then there exist integers m and
n such that x D 2m and y D 2n C 1. Then
x C y D 2m C .2n C 1/
D 2.m C n/ C 1

Since the integers are closed under addition, m C n is an integer and the last
equation shows that x C y is an odd integer. This proves that if x is an even
integer and y is an odd integer, then x C y is an odd integer.
3. If x is an odd integer and y is an odd integer, then there exist integers m and
n such that x D 2m C 1 and y D 2n C 1. Then
x C y D .2m C 1/ C .2n C 1/
D 2.m C n C 1/

Since the integers are closed under addition, m C n C 1 is an integer and the
last equation shows that x C y is an even integer. This proves that if x is an
odd integer and y is an odd integer, then x C y is an even integer.

Proof. We assume that m is an odd integer and will prove that 3m2 C 4m C 6 .
Since m is an odd integer, there exists an integer
 k such that m D 2k C 1. Substituting this into the expression 3m2 C 4m C 6 and using algebra, we obtain

D 2 6k 2 C 10k C 6 C 1

By the closure properties of the integers, 6k 2 C 10k C 6 is an integer, and hence,
the last equation shows that 3m2 C 4m C 6 is an odd integer. This proves that if m
is an odd integer, then 3m2 C 4m C 6 is an odd integer.

Proof. We let m be a real number and assume that m, m C 1, and m C 2 are the
lengths of the three sides of a right triangle. We will use the Pythagorean Theorem
to prove that m D 3. Since the hypotenuse is the longest of the three sides, the
Pythagorean Theorem implies that m2 C .m C 1/2 D .m C 2/2 . We will now use
algebra to rewrite both sides of this equation as follows:

m2 C m2 C 2m C 1 D m2 C 4m C 4
2m2 C 2m C 1 D m2 C 4m C 4

The last equation is a quadratic equation. To solve for m, we rewrite the equation
in standard form and then factor the left side. This gives
m2
.m

2m

3D0

3/.m C 1/ D 0

The two solutions of this equation are m D 3 and m D 1. However, since m is
the length of a side of a right triangle, m must be positive and we conclude that
m D 3. This proves that if m, m C 1, and m C 2 are the lengths of the three sides
of a right triangle, then m D 3.

The following proposition provides answers for Problems (3) and (4).
Proposition 4.11. For all natural numbers n with n  8, there exist non-negative
integers x and y such that n D 3x C 5y.
Proof. (by mathematical induction) Let Z D fx 2 Z j x  0g, and for each natural number n, let P .n/ be, ‚Äúthere exist x; y 2 Z such that n D 3x C 5y.‚Äù
Basis Step: Using the table above, we see that P .8/, P .9/, and P .10/ are true.
Inductive Step: Let k 2 N with k  10. Assume that P .8/, P .9/, . . . , P .k/ are
true. Now, notice that
k C 1 D 3 C .k 2/ :
Since k  10, we can conclude that k 2  8 and hence P .k 2/ is true.
Therefore, there exist non-negative integers u and v such that k 2 D .3u C 5v/.
Using this equation, we see that
k C 1 D 3 C .3u C 5v/

D 3 .1 C u/ C 5v:

Hence, we can conclude that P .k C 1/ is true. This proves that if P .8/, P .9/,
. . . , P .k/are true, then P .k C 1/ is true. Hence, by the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, for all natural numbers n with n  8, there exist nonnegative
integers x and y such that n D 3x C 5y.

Since f3 D 2, we see that P .1/ is true and this proves the basis step.

That is, assume that f3k is an even natural number. This means that there exists an

We need to prove that P .k C 1/ is true or that f3.kC1/ is even. Notice that

Using the recursion formula again, we get f3kC2 D f3kC1 C f3k . Putting this all

This preceding equation shows that f3.kC1/ is even. Hence it has been proved that

By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, this proves that for each natural number n, the Fibonacci number f3n is an even natural number.

The functions f and s are surjections. The functions k and F are not surjections.

Progress Check 6.15
The function f is an injection but not a surjection. To see that it is an injection, let
a; b 2 R and assume that f .a/ D f .b/. This implies that e a D e b . Now use
the natural logarithm function to prove that a D b. Since e x > 0 for each real
number x, there is no x 2 R such that f .x/ D 1. So f is not a surjection.
The function g is an injection and is a surjection. The proof that g is an injection is
basically the same as the proof that f is an injection. To prove that g is a surjection,
let b 2 RC. To construct the real number a such that g.a/ D b, solve the equation
e a D b for a. The solution is a D ln b. It can then be verified that g.a/ D b.

Theorem 8.12. Let a, b, and c be integers. If a and b are relatively prime and
a j .bc/, then a j c.
Proof. Let a, b, and c be integers. Assume that a and b are relatively prime and
a j .bc/. We will prove that a divides c.
Since a divides bc, there exists an integer k such that
bc D ak:

(1)

In addition, we are assuming that a and b are relatively prime and hence gcd.a; b/ D
1. So by Theorem 8.9, there exist integers m and n such that
am C bn D 1:

(2)

We now multiply both sides of equation (2) by c. This gives
.am C bn/c D 1  c
acm C bcn D c

(3)

We can now use equation (1) to substitute bc D ak in equation (3) and obtain
acm C ak n D c:
If we now factor the left side of this last equation, we see that a.cm C k n/ D c.
Since .cm C k n/ is an integer, this proves that a divides c. Hence, we have proven
that if a and b are relatively prime and a j .bc/, then a j c.

where k is an integer. Notice that x D 2 and y D 1 is a solution of this equation. If

1. Since 21 does not divide 40, Theorem 8.22 tells us that the Diophantine

In fact, we can graph the straight line whose equation is 63x C 336y D 40 in
the Cartesian plane. From the fact that there is no pair of integers x; y such
that 63x C 336y D 40, we can conclude that there is no point on the graph
of this line in which both coordinates are integers.
2. To write formulas that will generate all the solutions, we first need to find
one solution for 144x C 225y D 27. This can sometimes be done by trial

to use the Euclidean Algorithm in reverse to write gcd.144; 225/ as a linear
combination of 144 and 225. See Section 8.1 to review how to do this. The
result from using the Euclidean Algorithm in reverse for this situation is

If we multiply both sides of this equation by 3, we obtain
144  33 C 225  . 21/ D 27:
This means that x0 D 33; y0 D 21 is a solution of the linear Diophantine

Player Two has a winning strategy. On the kth turn, whatever symbol Player One
puts in the kth position of the kth row, Player Two must put the other symbol in the
kth position of his or her row. This guarantees that the row of symbols produced
by Player Two will be different that any of the rows produced by Player One.
This is the same idea used in Cantor‚Äôs Diagonal Argument. Once we have a

the list by making sure that its kth decimal place is different than the kth decimal

For the second case, n  1 .mod 3/. We can then use Theorem 3.28
to conclude that n3  13 .mod 3/ or that n3  1 .mod 3/. So in this
case, n3  n .mod 3/.
The last case is when n  2 .mod 3/. We then get n3  23 .mod 3/

So, if a  1 .mod 3/, then by Theorem 3.28, a  a  1  1 .mod 3/,

If a  2 .mod 3/, then by Theorem 3.28, a  a  2  2 .mod 3/,

(3) a  2 .mod 3/ and b  1 .mod 3/;

For example, for the third case, we see that ab  2  1 .mod 3/. That is,

(a) Let P .n/ be, ‚Äú3n > 1 C 2n .‚Äù P .2/ is true since 32 D 9, 1 C 22 D 5,
and 9 > 5.
For the inductive step, we assume that P .k/ is true and so
3k > 1 C 2k :

(1)

To prove that P .k C 1/ is true, we must prove that 3kC1 > 1 C 2kC1 .
Multiplying both sides inequality (1) by 3 gives
3kC1 > 3 C 3  2k :

Now, since 3 > 1 and 3  2k > 2kC1 , we see that 3 C 3  2k > 1 C 2kC1
and hence, 3kC1 > 1 C 2kC1 . Thus, if P .k/ is true, then P .k C 1/ is
true. This proves the inductive step.

step, we assume that k  5 and that P .k/ is true or that k 2 < 2k . With these
assumptions, we need to prove that P .k C1/ is true or that .k C1/2 < 2kC1 .
We first note that
.k C 1/2 D k 2 C 2k C 1 < 2k C 2k C 1:

(1)

Since k  5, we see that 5k < k 2 and so 2k C 3k < k 2 . However, 3k > 1
and so 2k C 1 < 2k C 3k < k 2 . Combinining this with inequality (1),
we obtain.k C 1/2 < 2k C k 2 . Using the assumption that P .k/ is true

k 2 < 2k , we obtain
.k C 1/2 < 2k C 2k D 2  2k

.k C 1/2 < 2kC1

This proves that if P .k/ is true, then P .k C 1/ is true.

(a) The set A is a subset of B. To prove this, we let x 2 A. Then 2 <
x < 2. Since x < 2, we conclude that x 2 B and hence, we have
proved that A is a subset of B.
(b) The set B is not a subset of A. There are many examples of a real

not in B.

(c) B 6 A. For example, 3 2 B and 3 ‚Ä¶ A.
5.

(a) We will prove that A D B. Notice that if x 2 A, then there exists an
integer m such that x 2 D 3m. We can use this equation to see that
2x 4 D 6m and so 6 divides .2x 4/. Therefore, x 2 B and hence,
A  B.
Conversely, if y 2 B, then there exists an integer m such that 2y 4 D
6m. Hence, y 2 D 3m, which implies that y  2 .mod 3/ and
y 2 A. Therefore, B  A.

(c) A \ B D ;. To prove this, we will use a proof by contradiction and
assume that A \ B ¬§ ;. So there exists an x in A \ B. We can then
conclude that there exist integers m and n such that x 1 D 5m and
x y D 10n. So x D 5m C 1 and x D 10n C 7. We then see that

Now let y 2 A. Then, y ‚Ä¶ Ac and hence, y 2 .Ac /c . Therefore,
A  .Ac /c .

(c) Let x 2 U . Then x ‚Ä¶ ; and so x 2 ;c . Therefore, U  ;c . Also,
since every set we deal with is a subset of the universal set, ;c  U .

2. To prove that A \ .B [ C /  .A \ B/ [ .A \ C /, we let x 2 A \ .B [ C /.
Then x 2 A and x 2 B [ C . So we will use two cases: (1) x 2 B; (2)
x 2 C.
In Case (1), x 2 A \ B and, hence, x 2 .A \ B/ [ .A \ C /. In Case (2),
x 2 A\C and, hence, x 2 .A\B/[.A\C /. This proves that A\.B[C / 
.A \ B/ [ .A \ C /.

To prove that .A \ B/ [ .A \ C /  A \ .B [ C /, let y 2 .A \ B/ [
.A \ C /. Then, y 2 A \ B or y 2 A \ C . If y 2 A \ B, then y 2 A
and y 2 B. Therefore, y 2 A and y 2 B [ C . So, we may conclude that
y 2 A \ .B [ C /. In a similar manner, we can prove that if y 2 A \ C , then
y 2 A \ .B [ C /. This proves that .A \ B/ [ .A \ C /  A \ .B [ C /,

So, we have:
u D .x; y/ 2 A  B and u D .x; y/ 2 A  C .
Hence, u 2 .A  B/\.A  C / and this proves that A.B \ C /  .A  B/\

Now let v 2 .A  B/ \ .A  C /. Then, v 2 A  B and v 2 A  C . So,
there exists an s in A and a t in B such that v D .s; t /. But, since v is
also in A  C , we see that t must also be in C . Thus, t 2 B \ C and so,
v 2 A  .B \ C /. This proves that .A  B/ \ .A  C /  A  .B \ C /.

the case where x 2 A, we see that u 2 A  C , and in the case where x 2 B,
we see that u 2 B  C . Hence, u 2 .A  C / [ .B  C /. This proves that

We still need to prove that .A  C / [ .B  C /  A  .B [ C /.

7. The birthday function is not an injection since there are two different people

9.

(a) The function f is an injection and a surjection. To prove that f is an
injection, we assume that .a; b/ 2 R  R, .c; d / 2 R  R, and that
f .a; b/ D f .c; d /. This means that
.2a; a C b/ D .2c; c C d /:
Since this equation is an equality of ordered pairs, we see that
2a D 2c, and

a C b D c C d:

The first equation implies that a D c. Substituting this into the second
equation shows that b D d . Hence,

and we have shown that if f .a; b/ D f .c; d /, then .a; b/ D .c; d /.
Therefore, f is an injection.
Now, to determine if f is a surjection, we let .r; s/ 2 R  R. To find
an ordered pair .a; b/ 2 R  R such that f .a; b/ D .r; s/, we need
.2a; a C b/ D .r; s/:
That is, we need

both an injection and a surjection, it is a bijection.
(b) The proof that the function g is an injection is similar to the proof that

3. There are many possible equivalence relations on this set. Perhaps one of the
easier ways to determine one is to first decide what elements will be equivalent. For example, suppose we say that we want 1 and 2 to be equivalent

the symbol  for the equivalence relation, then we need 1  2 and 2  1.

(a) The relation  is an equivalence relation on Z. It is reflexive since
for each integer a, a C a D 2a and hence, 2 divides a C a. Now let
a; b 2 Z and assume that 2 divides a C b. Since a C b D b C a,
2 divides b C a and hence,  is symmetric. Finally, let a; b; c 2 Z
and assume that a  b and b  c. Since 2 divides a C b, a and b
must both be odd or both be even. In the case that a and b are both
odd, then b  c implies that c must be odd. Hence, a C c is even and
a  c. A similar proof shows that if a and b are both even, then a  c.
Therefore,  is transitive.

1. For both parts, use the fact that the only natural number divisors of a prime
number p are 1 and p.

2. Use cases: (1) p divides a; (2) p does not divide a. In the first case, the
conclusion is automatically true. For the second case, use the fact that
gcd.p; a/ D 1 and so we can use Theorem 8.12 to conclude that p divides
b. Another option is to write the number 1 as a linear combination of a and
p and then multiply both sides of the equation by b.

3. A hint for the inductive step: Write p j .a1 a2    am /amC1 . Then look at
two cases: (1) p j amC1 ; (2) p does not divide amC1 .

2. One way to do this is to prove that the following function is a bijection:
f W A  fxg ! A by f .a; x/ D a, for all .a; x/ 2 A  fxg.
3. One way to prove that N  E C is to find a bijection from N to E C . One
possibility is f W N ! E C by f .n/ D 2n for all n 2 N. (We must prove
that this is a bijection.)
4. Notice that A D .A fxg/ [ fxg. Use Theorem 9.6 to conclude that A fxg
is finite. Then use Lemma 9.4.
5.

(a) Since A \ B  A, if A is finite, then Theorem 9.6 implies that A \ B
is finite.
(b) The sets A and B are subsets of A [ B. So if A [ B is finite, then A

(a) Remember that two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their corresponding coordinates are equal. So if .a1 ; c1 / ; .a2 ; c2 / 2 A  C and
h .a1 ; c1 / D h .a2 ; c2 /, then .f .a1 / ; g .c1 // D .f .a2 / ; g .c2 //. We
can then conclude that f .a1 / D f .a2 / and g .c1 / D g .c2 /. Since f
and g are both injections, this means that a1 D a2 and c1 D c2 and
therefore, .a1 ; c1 / D .a2 ; c2 /. This proves that f is an injection.
Now let .b; d / 2 B  D. Since f and g are surjections, there exists
a 2 A and c 2 C such that f .a/ D b and g .c/ D d . Therefore,
h .a; c/ D .b; d /. This proves that f is a surjection.

8.

(a) If we define the function f by f .1/ D a, f .2/ D b, f .3/ D c,
f .4/ D a, and f .5/ D b, then we can use g.a/ D 1, g.b/ D 2, and
g.3/ D c. The function g is an injection.

Section 9.2
1. All except Part (d) are true.
2.

(a) Prove that the function f W N ! F C defined by f .n/ D 5n for all

if n  4:

and then prove that the function f is a bijection.
It is also possible to use Corollary 9.20 to conclude that N f4; 5; 6g is
countable, but it must also be proved that N f4; 5; 6g cannot be finite.
To do this, assume that N f4; 5; 6g is finite and then prove that N is
finite, which is a contradiction.
(f) Let A D fm 2 Z j m  2 .mod 3/g D f3k C 2 j k 2 Zg. Prove that
the function f W Z ! A is a bijection, where f .x/ D 3x C 2 for all

Therefore, h is an injection.
Since f is an injection, this implies that

Now let y 2 A [ B. There are only two cases to consider: y 2 A or y 2 B.
If y 2 A, then since f is a surjection, there exists an m 2 N such that

Now assume y 2 B and use the fact that g is a surjection to help prove that

We can then conclude that h is a surjection.
7. By Theorem 9.14, the set QC of positive rational numbers is countably infinite. So by Theorem 9.15, QC [ f0g is countably infinite. Now prove that
the set Q of all negative rational numbers is countably infinite and then use
Theorem 9.17 to prove that Q is countably infinite.
8. Since A B  A, the set A B is countable. Now assume A
and show that this leads to a contradiction.

(a) One such bijection is f W .0; 1/ ! R by f .x/ D ln x for all x 2

(b) One such bijection is g W .0; 1/ ! .a; 1/ by g.x/ D x C a for all
x 2 .0; 1/. The function g is a bijection and so .0; 1/  .a; 1/.
Then use Part (a).

2. Use a proof by contradiction. Let H be the set of irrational numbers and
assume that H is countable. Then R D Q [ H and Q and H are disjoint. Use
Theorem 9.17, to obtain a contradiction.
3. By Corollary 9.20, every subset of a countable set is countable. So if B is
