Introduction to Calculus

1.4 Velocity and Distance
The right way to begin a calculus book is with calculus. This chapter will jump
directly into the two problems that the subject was invented to solve. You will see
what the questions are, and you will see an important part of the answer. There are
plenty of good things left for the other chapters, so why not get started?
The book begins with an example that is familiar to everybody who drives a car.
It is calculus in action-the driver sees it happening. The example is the relation
between the speedometer and the odometer. One measures the speed (or velocity);
the other measures the distance traveled. We will write v for the velocity, and f for
how far the car has gone. The two instruments sit together on the dashboard:

Fig. 1.1 Velocity v and total distance f (at one instant of time).

Notice that the units of measurement are different for v and f.The distance f is
measured in kilometers or miles (it is easier to say miles). The velocity v is measured
in km/hr or miles per hour. A unit of time enters the velocity but not the distance.
Every formula to compute v from f will have f divided by time.
The central question of calculus is the relation between v and f.

1 Introduction to Calculus

Can you find v if you know f , and vice versa, and how? If we know the velocity over
the whole history of the car, we should be able to compute the total distance traveled.
In other words, if the speedometer record is complete but the odometer is missing,
its information could be recovered. One way to do it (without calculus) is to put in
a new odometer and drive the car all over again at the right speeds. That seems like
a hard way; calculus may be easier. But the point is that the information is there.
If we know everything about v, there must be a method to find f .
What happens in the opposite direction, when f is known? If you have a complete
record of distance, could you recover the complete velocity? In principle you could drive
the car, repeat the history, and read off the speed. Again there must be a better way.
The whole subject of calculus is built on the relation between u and f . The question
we are raising here is not some kind of joke, after which the book will get serious
and the mathematics will get started. On the contrary, I am serious now-and the
mathematics has already started. We need to know how to find the velocity from a
record of the distance. (That is called &@erentiation, and it is the central idea of
dflerential calculus.) We also want to compute the distance from a history of the
velocity. (That is integration, and it is the goal of integral calculus.)
Differentiation goes from f to v; integration goes from v to f . We look first
at examples in which these pairs can be computed and understood.
CONSTANT VELOCITY

Suppose the velocity is fixed at v = 60 (miles per hour). Then f increases at this
constant rate. After two hours the distance is f = 120 (miles). After four hours
f = 240 and after t hours f = 60t. We say that f increases linearly with time-its
graph is a straight line.

Fig. 1.2 Constant velocity v = 60 and linearly increasing distance f = 60t.

Notice that this example starts the car at full velocity. No time is spent picking up
speed. (The velocity is a "step function.") Notice also that the distance starts at zero;
the car is new. Those decisions make the graphs of v and f as neat as possible. One
is the horizontal line v = 60. The other is the sloping line f = 60t. This v, f , t relation
needs algebra but not calculus:

if v is constant and f starts at zero then f = vt.
The opposite is also true. When f increases linearly, v is constant. The division by
time gives the slope. The distance is fl = 120 miles when the time is t 1 = 2 hours.
Later f' = 240 at t , = 4. At both points, the ratio f / t is 60 miles/hour. Geometrically,
the velocity is the slope of the distance graph:
slope =

change in distance vt -- v.

t

1.1 Velocity and Distance

Fig. 1.3 Straight lines f = 20

+ 60t (slope 60) and f = - 30t (slope - 30).

The slope of the f-graph gives the v-graph. Figure 1.3 shows two more possibilities:
1. The distance starts at 20 instead of 0. The distance formula changes from 60t
to 20 + 60t. The number 20 cancels when we compute change in distance-so
the slope is still 60.
2. When v is negative, the graph off goes downward. The car goes backward and
the slope o f f = - 30t is v = - 30.
I don't think speedometers go below zero. But driving backwards, it's not that safe
to watch. If you go fast enough, Toyota says they measure "absolute valuesw-the
speedometer reads + 30 when the velocity is - 30. For the odometer, as far as I know
it just stops. It should go backward.?
VELOCITY vs. DISTANCE: SLOPE vs. AREA

How do you compute f' from v? The point of the question is to see f = ut on the
graphs. We want to start with the graph of v and discover the graph off. Amazingly,
the opposite of slope is area.
The distance f is the area under the v-graph. When v is constant, the region under
the graph is a rectangle. Its height is v, its width is t , and its area is v times t. This is
integration, to go from v to f by computing the area. We are glimpsing two of the
central facts of calculus.
1A The slope of the f-graph gives the velocity v. The area under the v-graph
gives the distance f.

That is certainly not obvious, and I hesitated a long time before I wrote it down in
this first section. The best way to understand it is to look first at more examples. The
whole point of calculus is to deal with velocities that are not constant, and from now
on v has several values.
EXAMPLE (Forward and back) There is a motion that you will understand right away.
The car goes forward with velocity V, and comes back at the same speed. To say it

more correctly, the velocity in the second part is - V. If the forward part lasts until
t = 3, and the backward part continues to t = 6, the car will come back where it started.
The total distance after both parts will be f = 0.
-

+This actually happened in Ferris Bueller's Day 08,
when the hero borrowed his father's sports
car and ran up the mileage. At home he raised the car and drove in reverse. I forget if it
worked.

Fig. 1.4

Velocities

+ V and - V give motion forward and back, ending at f (6)= 0.

+

The v-graph shows velocities + V and - V. The distance starts up with slope V
and reaches f = 3 V. Then the car starts backward. The distance goes down with slope
- V and returns to f = 0 at t = 6 .
Notice what that means. The total area "under" the v-graph is zero! A negative
velocity makes the distance graph go downward (negative slope). The car is moving
backward. Area below the axis in the v-graph is counted as negative.
FUNCTIONS

This forward-back example gives practice with a crucially important idea-the
cept of a "jiunction." We seize this golden opportunity to explain functions:
The number v(t) is the value of the function

t. at

con-

the time t.

The time t is the input to the function. The velocity v(t) at that time is the output.
Most people say "v oft" when they read v(t). The number "v of 2" is the velocity
when t = 2. The forward-back example has v(2) = + V and v(4) = - V. The function
contains the whole history, like a memory bank that has a record of v at each t.
It is simple to convert forward-back motion into a formula. Here is v(t):

The ,right side contains the instructions for finding v(t). The input t is converted into
the output V or - V. The velocity v(t) depends on t. In this case the function is
"di~continuo~s,~'
because the needle jumps at t = 3. The velocity is not dejined at that
instant. There is no v(3). (You might argue that v is zero at the jump, but that leads
to trouble.) The graph off' has a corner, and we can't give its slope.
The problem also involves a second function, namely the distance. The principle
behind f(t) is the same: f (t) is the distance at time t. It is the net distance forward,
and again the instructions change at t = 3. In the forward motion, f(t) equals Vt as
before. In the backward half, a calculation is built into the formula for f(t):

+

At the switching time the right side gives two instructions (one on each line). This
would be bad except that they agree: f (3) = 3 V . v h e distance function is "con?A function is only allowed one ~:alue,f'(r)
or ~ ( tat) each time

r

tinuous." There is no jump in f, even when there is a jump in v. After t = 3 the distance
decreases because of - Vt. At t = 6 the second instruction correctly gives f (6) = 0.
Notice something more. The functions were given by graphs before they were given
by formulas. The graphs tell you f and v at every time t-sometimes more clearly
than the formulas. The values f (t) and v(t) can also be given by tables or equations
or a set of instructions. (In some way all functions are instructions-the function
tells how to find f at time t.) Part of knowing f is knowing all its inputs and
outputs-its domain and range:
The domain of a function is the set of inputs. The range is the set of outputs.

The domain of f consists of all times 0 < t < 6. The range consists of all distances
0 <f(t) < 3V. (The range of v contains only the two velocities + V and - V.)
We mention now, and repeat later, that every "linear" function has a formula
f (t) = vt + C. Its graph is a line and v is the slope. The constant C moves the line up
and down. It adjusts the line to go through any desired starting point.
SUMMARY: MORE ABOUT FUNCTIONS

May I collect together the ideas brought out by this example? We had two functions
v and f. One was velocity, the other was distance. Each function had a domain,
and a range, and most important a graph. For the f-graph we studied the slope
(which agreed with v). For the v-graph we studied the area (which agreed with f).
Calculus produces functions in pairs, and the best thing a book can do early is to
show you more of them.

Note about the definition of a function. The idea behind the symbol f (t) is absolutely
crucial to mathematics. Words don't do it justice! By definition, a function is a "rule"
that assigns one member of the range to each member of the domain. Or, a function
is a set of pairs (t, f (t))with no t appearing twice. (These are "ordered pairs" because
we write t before f (t).) Both of those definitions are correct-but somehow they are
too passive.
In practice what matters is the active part. The number f (t) is produced from the
number t. We read a graph, plug into a formula, solve an equation, run a computer
program. The input t is "mapped" to the output f(t), which changes as t changes.
Calculus is about the rate of change. This rate is our other function v.

Fig. 1.5 Subtracting 2 from f affects the range. Subtracting 2 from t affects the domain.

1 Introduction to Calculus

It is quite hard at the beginning, and not automatic, to see the difference between
f (t) - 2 and f (t - 2). Those are both new functions, created out of the original f (t).
In f (t) - 2, we subtract 2 from all the distances. That moves the whole graph down.
In f ( t - 2), we subtract 2 from the time. That moves the graph over to the right.
Figure 1.5 shows both movements, starting from f (t) = 2t + 1. The formula to find
f (t - 2) is 2(t - 2) + 1, which is 2t - 3.
A graphing calculator also moves the graph, when you change the viewing window.
You can pick any rectangle A < t < B, C <f(t) < D. The screen shows that part of
the graph. But on the calculator, the function f ( t )remains the same. It is the axes that
get renumbered. In our figures the axes stay the same and the function is changed.
There are two more basic ways to change a function. (We are always creating new
functions-that is what mathematics is all about.) Instead of subtracting or adding,
we can multiply the distance by 2. Figure 1.6 shows 2f (t). And instead of shifting the
time, we can speed it up. The function becomes f(2t). Everything happens twice as
fast (and takes half as long). On the calculator those changes correspond to a
"zoom"-on
the f axis or the t axis. We soon come back to zooms.

1.1 EXERCISES
Each section of the book contains read-through questions. They
allow you to outline the section yourself-more actively than
reading a summary. This is probably the best way to remember
the important ideas.
Starting from f(0) = 0 at constant velocity v, the distance
function is f (t)= a . When f ( t ) = 55t the velocity is
v = b . When f(t) = 55t + 1000 the velocity is still c
and the starting value is f (0) = d . In each case v is the
e
of the graph off. When
f
is negative, the graph
of
s goes downward. In that case area in the t.-graph
counts as h .
Forward motion from f (0) = 0 to f (2) = 10 has v = i .
Then backward motion to f (4) = 0 has v = i . The distance function is f (t)= 5t for 0 < t < 2 and then f (t) = k

(not - 5t). The slopes are
I
and m . The distance
f(3) = n . The area under the v-graph up to time 1.5 is
o . The domain o f f is the time interval
P , and the
range is the distance interval q . The range of v(t) is only
1
.
-

The value off (t) = 3t + 1 at t = 2 is f (2) = s . The value
19 equals f ( t ). The difference f (4)-f (1) = u . That
is the change in distance, when 4 - 1 is the change in v .
The ratio of those changes equals w , which is the x
of the graph. The formula for f (t) + 2 is 3t + 3 whereas
f (t + 2) equals Y . Those functions have the same z
and f (t 2) is
as f : the graph of f (t) + 2 is shifted A
shifted B . The formula for f (5t) is C . The formula
for 5f ( t )is D . The slope has jumped from 3 to
E
.

1.2 Calculus Without Limits
The next page is going to reveal one of the key ideas behind calculus. The discussion
is just about numbers-functions and slopes can wait. The numbers are not even
special, they can be any numbers. The crucial point is to look at their differences:
Suppose the numbers are f = 0 2 6 7 4 9
Their differences are v =
2 4 1 - 3 5
The differences are printed in between, to show 2 - 0 = 2 and 6 - 2 = 4 and 7 - 6 = 1.

1.2

Calculus Without Limits

Notice how 4 - 7 gives a negative answer -3. The numbers in f can go up or down,
the differences in v can be positive or negative. The idea behind calculus comes when
you add up those differences:
2+4+1-3+5=9
The sum of differences is 9. This is the last number on the top line (in f). Is this an
accident, or is this always true? If we stop earlier, after 2 + 4 + 1, we get the 7 in f.
Test any prediction on a second example:
Suppose the numbers are f= 1 3 7 8 5 10
Their differences are v =
2 4 1 -3 5
The f's are increased by 1. The differences are exactly the same-no change. The
sum of differences is still 9. But the last f is now 10. That prediction is not right, we
don't always get the last f.
The first f is now 1. The answer 9 (the sum of differences) is 10 - 1, the last f
minus the first f. What happens when we change the f's in the middle?
Suppose the numbers are f= 1 5 12
7 10
Their differences are v =
4 7
-5 3
The differences add to 4 + 7 - 5 + 3 = 9. This is still 10 - 1. No matter what f's we
choose or how many, the sum of differences is controlled by the first f and last f.
If this is always true, there must be a clear reason why the middle f's cancel out.
The sum of differences is (5 - 1)+ (12 - 5)+ (7 - 12) + (10 - 7) = 10 - 1.
The 5's cancel, the 12's cancel, and the 7's cancel. It is only 10 - 1 that doesn't cancel.
This is the key to calculus!

EXAMPLE 1 The numbers grow linearly: f= 2 3 4 5 6 7
Their differences are constant: v = 1 1 1 1 1
The sum of differences is certainly 5. This agrees with 7 - 2 =fast -ffirst. The numbers
in v remind us of constant velocity. The numbers in f remind us of a straight line
f= vt + C. This example has v = 1 and the f's start at 2. The straight line would
come from f= t + 2.
EXAMPLE 2 The numbers are squares: f=
0
1 4 9 16
Their differences grow linearly: v = 1 3 5 7
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 agrees with 42 = 16. It is a beautiful fact that the first j odd numbers
always add up to j2. The v's are the odd numbers, the f's are perfect squares.
Note The letter j is sometimes useful to tell which number in f we are looking at.
For this example the zeroth number is fo = 0 and the jth number is fj =j2. This is a
part of algebra, to give a formula for the f's instead of a list of numbers. We can also
use j to tell which difference we are looking at. The first v is the first odd number
v,= 1. The jth difference is the jth odd number vj = 2j- 1.(Thus v4 is 8 - I = 7.) It
is better to start the differences with j = 1, since there is no zeroth odd number vo.
With this notation the jth difference is vj =fj -f -1.Sooner or later you will get
comfortable with subscripts like j and j - 1, but it can be later. The important point
is that the sum of the v's equals flast -first. We now connect the v's to slopes and the
f's to areas.

Linear increase in v = 1, 3, 5, 7. Squares in the distances f= 0, 1,4, 9, 16.

Figure 1.7 shows a natural way to graph Example 2, with the odd numbers in v and
the squares in f. Notice an important difference between the v-graph and the f-graph.
The graph of f is "piecewise linear." We plotted the numbers in f and connected
them by straight lines. The graph of v is "piecewise constant." We plotted the differences as constant over each piece. This reminds us of the distance-velocity graphs,
when the distance f(t) is a straight line and the velocity v(t) is a horizontal line.
Now make the connection to slopes:
distance up

The slope of the f-graph is distance
distance across

change in f

change in
change in t

Over each piece, the change in t (across) is 1. The change in f (upward) is the difference
that we are calling v. The ratio is the slope v/1l or just v. The slope makes a sudden
change at the breakpoints t = 1, 2, 3, .... At those special points the slope of the
f-graph is not defined-we connected the v's by vertical lines but this is very
debatable. The main idea is that between the breakpoints, the slope of f(t) is v(t).
Now make the connection to areas:
The total area under the v-graph is flast -ffirst

This area, underneath the staircase in Figure 1.7, is composed of rectangles. The base
of every rectangle is 1. The heights of the rectangles are the v's. So the areas also
equal the v's, and the total area is the sum of the v's. This area is flast -first.
Even more is true. We could start at any time and end at any later time
-not necessarily at the special times t = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Suppose we stop at t = 3.5.
Only half of the last rectangular area (under v = 7) will be counted. The total area is
1 + 3 + 5 + 2(7) = 12.5. This still agrees with flast -first = 12.5 - 0. At this new ending
time t = 3.5, we are only halfway up the last step in the f-graph. Halfway between
9 and 16 is 12.5.

This is nothing less than the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. But we have only
used algebra (no curved graphs and no calculations involving limits). For now the
Theorem is restricted to piecewise linear f(t) and piecewise constant v(t). In Chapter 5
that restriction will be overcome.
Notice that a proof of 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 42 is suggested by Figure 1.7a. The triangle
under the dotted line has the same area as the four rectangles under the staircase.
The area of the triangle is ½.base . height = -4 8, which is the perfect 9quare 42
When there are j rectangles instead of 4, we get .j. 2j =j2 for the area.

1.2 Calculus Wnhout Limits

The next examples show other patterns, where f and v increase exponentially or
oscillate around zero. I hope you like them but I don't think you have to learn them.
They are like the special functions 2' and sin t and cos t-except they go in steps.
You get a first look at the important functions of calculus, but you only need algebra.
Calculus is needed for a steadily changing velocity, when the graph off is curved.
The last example will be income tax-which really does go. in steps. Then Section 1.3 will introduce the slope of a curve. The crucial step for curves is working
with limits. That will take us from algebra to calculus.
EXPONENTIAL VELOCITY AND DISTANCE

Start with the numbers f = 1,2,4,8, 16. These are "powers of 2." They start with the
zeroth power, which is 2' = 1. The exponential starts at 1 and not 0. After j steps there
are j factors of 2, and & equals 2j. Please recognize the diflerence between 2j and j2
and 2j. The numbers 2j grow linearly, the numbers j2grow quadratically, the numbers
2' grow exponentially. At j = 10 these are 20 and 100 and 1024. The exponential 2'
quickly becomes much larger than the others.
The differences off = 1,2,4,8, 16 are exactly v = 1,2,4,8.. We get the same beautiful numbers. When the f's are powers of 2, so are the v's. The formula vj = 2"-' is
slightly different from & = 2j, because the first v is numbered v,. (Then v, = 2' = 1.
The zeroth power of every number is 1, except that 0' is meaningless.) The two graphs
in Figure 1.8 use the same numbers but they look different, because f is piecewise
linear and v is piecewise constant.

Where will calculus come in? It works with the smooth curve f (t) = 2'. This exponential growth is critically important for population and money in a bank and the
national debt. You can spot it by the following test: v(t) is proportional to f (t).
Remark The function 2' is trickier than t2. For f = t2 the slope is v = 2t. It is
proportional to t and not t2. For f = 2' the slope is v = c2', and we won't find the
constant c = .693 ... until Chapter 6. (The number c is the natural logarithm of 2.)
Problem 37 estimates c with a calculator-the important thing is that it's constant.
OSCILLATING VELOCITY AND DISTANCE

We have seen a forward-back motion, velocity V followed by - V. That is oscillation
of the simplest kind. The graph o f f goes linearly up and linearly down. Figure 1.9
shows another oscillation that returns to zero, but the path is more interesting.
The numbers in f are now 0, 1, 1,0, - 1, -l,O. Since f6 = 0 the motion brings us
back to the start. The whole oscillation can be repeated.

1 lnhoductlon to Calculus

The differences in v are 1,0, -1, -1,0, 1. They add up to zero, which agrees with
-Airst. It is the same oscillation as in f (and also repeatable), but shifted in time.
The f-graph resembles (roughly) a sine curve. The v-graph resembles (even more
roughly) a cosine curve. The waveforms in nature are smooth curves, while these are
"digitized"-the way a digital watch goes forward in jumps. You recognize that the
change from analog to digital brought the computer revolution. The same revolution
is coming in CD players. Digital signals (off or on, 0 or 1 ) seem to win every time.
The piecewise v and f start again at t = 6. The ordinary sine and cosine repeat at
t = 2n. A repeating motion is periodic-here the "period" is 6 or 2n. (With t in degrees
the period is 360-a full circle. The period becomes 2n when angles are measured in
radians. We virtually always use radians-which are degrees times 2n/360.) A watch
.
has a period of 12 hours. If the dial shows AM and PM, the period is

Jast

Fig. 1.9 Piecewise constant "cosine" and piecewise linear "sine." They both repeat.

A SHORT BURST O F SPEED

The next example is a car that is driven fast for a short time. The speed is V until
the distance reaches f = 1, when the car suddenly stops. The graph of f goes up
linearly with slope V , and then across with slope zero:
v(t) =

V upto t = T

0

after

t =T

f (0=

after

t=T

This is another example of "function notation." Notice the general time t and the
particular stopping time T. The distance is f (t). The domain off (the inputs) includes
all times t 3 0. The range of f (the outputs) includes all distances 0 f f < 1.
Figure 1.10 allows us to compare three cars-a Jeep and a Corvette and a Maserati.
They have different speeds but they all reach f = 1. So the areas under the v-graphs
are all 1. The rectangles have height V and base T = 1/ V.

Fig. 1.10 Bursts of speed with V, TM = Vc Tc = 'V, T,= 1. Step function has infinite slope.

Optional remark It is natural to think about faster and faster speeds, which means
steeper slopes. The f-graph reaches 1 in shorter times. The extreme case is a step
function, when the graph of f goes straight up. This is the unit step U(t),which is
zero up to t = 0 and jumps immediately to U = 1 for t > 0.

13

1.2 Calculus Without Limits
What is the slope of the step function? It is zero except at the jump. At that moment,

which is t = 0, the slope is infinite. We don't have an ordinary velocity v(t)-instead
we have an impulse that makes the car jump. The graph is a spike over the single
point t = 0, and it is often denoted by 6-so the slope of the step function is called
a "delta function." The area under the infinite spike is 1.
You are absolutely not responsible for the theory of delta functions! Calculus is
about curves, not jumps.
Our last example is a real-world application of slopes ands rates-to explain "how
taxes work." Note especially the difference between tax rates and tax brackets and
total tax. The rates are v, the brackets are on x, the total tax is f.
EXAMPLE 3

Income tax is piecewise linear. The slopes are the tax rates .15,.28,.31.

Suppose you are single with taxable income of x dollars (Form 1040, line 37-after
all deductions). These are the 1991 instructions from the Internal Revenue Service:
If x is not over $20,350, the tax is 15% of x.
If $20,350 < x < $49,300, the tax is $3052.50 + 28% of the amount over $20,350.
If x is over $49,300, the tax is $11,158.50 + 31% of the amount over $49,300.
The first bracket is 0 < x < $20,350. (The IRS never uses this symbol <, but I think
it is OK here. We know what it means.) The second bracket is $20,350 < x < $49,300.
The top bracket x > $49,300 pays tax at the top rate of 31%. But only the income in
that bracket is taxed at that rate.
Figure 1.11 shows the rates and the brackets and the tax due. Those are not average
rates, they are marginal rates. Total tax divided by total income would be the average
rate. The marginal rate of.28 or .31 gives the tax on each additionaldollar of incomeit is the slope at the point x. Tax is like area or distance-it adds up. Tax rate is like
slope or velocity-it depends where you are. This is often unclear in the news media.

The tax rate is v, the total tax is f. Tax brackets end at breakpoints.

Question What is the equation for the straight line in the top bracket?
Answer The bracket begins at x = $49,300 when the tax is f(x) = $11,158.50. The
slope of the line is the tax rate .31. When we know a point on the line and the slope,
we know the equation. This is important enough to be highlighted.

Section 2.3 presents this "point-slope equation" for any straight line. Here you see it
for one specific example. Where does the number $11,158.50 come from? It is the tax
at the end of the middle bracket, so it is the tax at the start of the top bracket.

1 Introduction to Calculus

Figure 1.1 1 also shows a distance-velocity example. The distance at t = 2 is
f (2) = 40 miles. After that time the velocity is 60 miles per hour. So the line with
slope 60 on the f-graph has the equation
f (t) = starting distance + extra distance = 40 + 60(t - 2).
The starting point is (2'40). The new speed 60 multiplies the extra time t - 2. The
point-slope equation makes sense. We now review this section, with comments.

Central idea Start with any numbers in f. Their differences go in v. Then the sum
of those differences is ha,,-ffirst.
Subscript notation The numbers are f,, fl, ... and the first difference is v, =fl -f,.
A typical number is fi and the jth difference is vj =fi -fi- . When those differences
are added, all f's in the middle (like f,) cancel out:

Examples

fi =j or j2 or 2'.

Then vj = 1 (constant) or 2j - 1 (odd numbers) or 2'-

'.

Functions Connect the f's to be piecewise linear. Then the slope v is piecewise
constant. The area under the v-graph from any t,,,,, to any ten, equals f (ten,)-f (t,,,,,).
Units Distance in miles and velocity in miles per hour. Tax in dollars and tax rate
in (dollars paid)/(dollars earned). Tax rate is a percentage like .28, with no units.

1.2 EXERCISES
Read-through questions

Problems 1-4 are about numbers f and differences v.

Start with the numbers f = 1,6,2,5. Their differences are
v = a .The sum of those differences is b .This is equal
to f,,,, minus c . The numbers 6 and 2 have no effect on
this answer, because in (6 - 1) + (2 - 6) + (5 - 2) the numbers
6 and 2 d . The slope of the line between f(0) = 1 and
f (1) = 6 is e . The equation of that line is f (t) = f .

1 From the numbers f = 0,2,7,10 find the differences u and
the sum of the three v's. Write down another f that leads
to the same v's. For f = 0,3,12,10 the sum of the u's is
still
.

With distances 1, 5, 25 at unit times, the velocities are
g . These are the
h
of the f-graph. The slope of the
tax graph is the tax i . If f(t) is the postage cost for t
ounces or t grams, the slope is the i per k . For
distances 0, 1,4,9 the velocities are I . The sum of the
first j odd numbers is fi = m . Then flo is n and the
velocity ulo is 0 .
The piecewise linear sine has slopes P . Those form a
piecewise q cosine. Both functions have r equal to
6, which means that f (t + 6) = s for every t. The velocities v = 1,2,4,8, ... have vj = t . In that case fo = 1 and
jj.= u . The sum of 1,2,4,8, 16 is v . The difference
2J - 2'- ' equals w . After a burst of speed V to time T,
the distance is x . If f(T) = 1 and V increases, the burst
lasts only to T = Y . When V approaches infinity, f (t)
approaches a
function. The velocities approach a
A
function, which is concentrated at t = 0 but has area
B
under its graph. The slope of a step function is c .

2 Starting from f = 1,3,2,4 draw the f-graph (linear pieces)
and the v-graph. What are the areas "under" the u-graph that
add to 4 - l? If the next number in f is 11, what is the area
under the next v?

3 From v = 1,2, 1'0, - 1 find the f's starting at fo = 3.

4 For f = 1, b, c, 7 find the differences vl ,u2, v, and add
them up. Do the same for f = a, b, c, 7. Do the same for
f = a, b, c, d.

Problems 5-11 are about linear functions and constant slopes.
5 Write down the slopes of these linear functions:
(a) f ( t ) = 1.lt (b) f ( t ) = 1 -2t (c) f ( t ) = 4 + 5(t -6).
Compute f (6) and f (7) for each function and confirm that
f (7) -f (6) equals the slope.

1.3 The Velocity at an Instant
We have arrived at the central problems that calculus was invented to solve. There
are two questions, in opposite directions, and I hope you could see them coming.
1. If the velocity is changing, how can you compute the distance traveled?
2. If the graph of f(t) is not a straight line, what is its slope?
Find the distance from the velocity, find the velocity from the distance. Our goal is
to do both-but not in one section. Calculus may be a good course, but it is not
magic. The first step is to let the velocity change in the steadiest possible way.
Question 1

Suppose the velocity at each time t is v(t) = 2t. Find f (t).

With zr= 2t, a physicist would say that the acceleration is constant (it equals 2). The
driver steps on the gas, the car accelerates, and the speedometer goes steadily up.
The distance goes up too-faster and faster. If we measure t in seconds and v in feet
per second, the distance f comes out in feet. After 10 seconds the speed is 20 feet
per second. After 44 seconds the speed is 88 feetlsecond (which is 60 miles/hour).
The acceleration is clear, but how far has the car gone?

1.3 The Velocity at an Instant

Question 2

The distance traveled by time t is f ( t )= t2. Find the velocity v(t).

The graph off ( t )= t 2 is on the right of Figure 1.12. It is a parabola. The curve starts
at zero, when the car is new. At t = 5 the distance is f = 25. By t = 10, f reaches 100.
Velocity is distance divided by time, but what happens when the speed is changing?
Dividing f = 100 by t = 10 gives v = 10-the average veEocity over the first ten
seconds. Dividing f = 121 by t = 11 gives the average speed over 11 seconds. But how
do we find the instantaneous velocity-the reading on the speedometer at the exact
instant when t = lo?

Fig. 1.12 The velocity v = 2t is linear. The distance f = t2 is quadratic.

I hope you see the problem. As the car goes faster, the graph of t 2 gets steeperbecause more distance is covered in each second. The average velocity between t = 10
and t = 11 is a good approximation-but only an approximation-to the speed at
the moment t = 10. Averages are easy to find:

average velocity is f (11)-f (10) 11- 10

121 - 100
= 21.
1

The car covered 21 feet in that 1 second. Its average speed was 21 feetlsecond. Since
it was gaining speed, the velocity at the beginning of that second was below 21.
Geometrically, what is the average? It is a slope, but not the slope of the curve.
The average velocity is the slope of a straight line. The line goes between two points
on the curve in Figure 1.12. When we compute an average, we pretend the velocity
is constant-so we go back to the easiest case. It only requires a division of distance
by time:
change in f
average velocity =
change in t
'

Calculus and the Law You enter a highway at 1 : 00. If you exit 150 miles away at
3 :00, your average speed is 75 miles per hour. I'm not sure if the police can give you
a ticket. You could say to the judge, "When was I doing 75?" The police would have

1 Introduction to Calculus

to admit that they have no idea-but
must have been doing 75 sometime.?

they would have a definite feeling that you

We return to the central problem-computing v(10) at the instant t = 10. The
average velocity over the next second is 21. We can also find the average over the
half-second between t = 10.0 and t = 10.5. Divide the change in distance by the change
in time:
f (10.5) -f (10.0) - (10.5)2- (10.0)2- 110.25 - 100 = 20.5.
10.5 - 10.0
.5
.5
That average of 20.5 is closer to the speed at t = 10. It is still not exact.
The way to find v(10) is to keep reducing the time interval. This is the basis for
Chapter 2, and the key to differential calculus. Find the slope between points that are
closer and closer on the curve. The "limit" is the slope at a single point.
Algebra gives the average velocity between t = 10 and any later time t = 10 + h.
The distance increases from lo2 to (10 + h)l. The change in time is h. So divide:

This formula fits our previous calculations. The interval from t = 10 to t = 11 had
h = 1, and the average was 20 h = 21. When the time step was h = i,the average
was 20 + 4= 20.5. Over a millionth of a second the average will be 20 plus
1/1,000,000-which is very near 20.

+

Conclusion: The velocity at t = 10 is v = 20. That is the slope of the curve. It agrees
with the v-graph on the left side of Figure 1.12, which also has v(10) = 20.
We now show that the two graphs match at all times. If f (t) = t 2 then v(t) = 2t.
You are seeing the key computation of calculus, and we can put it into words before
equations. Compute the distance at time t + h, subtract the distance at time t, and
divide by h. That gives the average velocity:

+

This fits the previous calculation, where t was 10. The average was 20 h. Now the
average is 2t + h. It depends on the time step h, because the velocity is changing. But
we can see what happens as h approaches zero. The average is closer and closer to
the speedometer reading of 2t, at the exact moment when the clock shows time t:

I 1E

As h approaches zero, the average velooity 2t + h approaches v(t) = 2t.

I

Note The computation (3) shows how calculus needs algebra. If we want the whole
v-graph, we have to let time be a "variable." It is represented by the letter t. Numbers
are enough at the specific time t = 10 and the specific step h = 1-but algebra gets
beyond that. The average between any t and any t + h is 2t + h. Please don't hesitate
to put back numbers for the letters-that checks the algebra.

+This is our first encounter with the much despised "Mean Value Theorem." If the judge can
prove the theorem, you are dead. A few u-graphs and f-graphs will confuse the situation
(possibly also a delta function).

1.3 The VelocHy at an Instant

There is also a step beyond algebra! Calculus requires the limit of the average. As
h shrinks to zero, the points on the graph come closer. "Average over an interval"
becomes "velocity at an instant.'' The general theory of limits is not particularly
simple, but here we don't need it. (It isn't particularly hard either.) In this example
the limiting value is easy to identify. The average 2t + h approaches 2t, as h -,0.
What remains to do in this section? We answered Question 2-to find velocity
from distance. We have not answered Question 1. If v(t) = 2t increases linearly with
time, what is the distance? This goes in the opposite direction (it is integration).
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that no new work is necessary. Zfthe
slope o f f (t) leads to v(t), then the area under that v-graph leads back to the f-graph.
The odometer readings f = t2 produced speedometer readings v = 2t. By the Fundamental Theorem, the area under 2t should be t2. But we have certainly not proved
any fundamental theorems, so it is better to be safe-by actually computing the area.
Fortunately, it is the area of a triangle. The base of the triangle is t and the height
is v = 2t. The area agrees with f (t):
area = i(base)(height)= f (t)(2t)= t2.

EXAMPLE 1 The graphs are shifted in time. The car doesn't start until t = 1. Therefore
v = 0 and f = O up to that time. After the car starts we have v = 2(t - 1) and
f = (t You see how the time delay of 1 enters the formulas. Figure 1.13 shows
how it affects the graphs.

+ b and f = $at2 + bt.

EXAMPLE 2 The acceleration changes from 2 to another constant a. The velocity
changes from v = 2t to v = at. The acceleration is the slope ofthe velocity curve! The
distance is also proportional to a, but notice the factor 3:

distance f = f at2.

If a equals 1, then v = t and f = f t2. That is one of the most famous pairs in calculus.
If a equals the gravitational constant g, then v = gt is the velocity of a falling body.
The speed doesn't depend on the mass (tested by Galileo at the Leaning Tower of
Pisa). Maybe he saw the distance f = &gt2more easily than the speed v = gt. Anyway,
this is the most famous pair in physics.

+ t2. The average velocity from t to t + h is

f (t + h) -f (t) 3(t + h) + (t + h)2 - 3t - t2
h
h

The change in distance has an extra 3h (coming from 3(t + h) minus 3t). The velocity
contains an additional 3 (coming from 3h divided by h). When 3t is added to the
distance, 3 is added to the velocity. If Galileo had thrown a weight instead of dropping
it, the starting velocity vo would have added vot to the distance.
FUNCTIONS ACROSS TIME

The idea of slope is not difficult-for one straight line. Divide the change in f by
the change in t. In Chapter 2, divide the change in y by the change in x. Experience
shows that the hard part is to see what happens to the slope as the line moves.
Figure 1.l4a shows the line between points A and B on the curve. This is a "secant
line." Its slope is an average velocity. What calculus does is to bring that point B
down the curve toward A.

.

Question I What happens to the "change in f "-the height of B above A?
Answer The change in f decreases to zero. So does the change in t.
Question 2 As B approaches A, does the slope of the line increase or decrease?
Answer I am not going to answer that question. It is too important. Draw another
secant line with B closer to A. Compare the slopes.

This question was created by Steve Monk at the University of Washington-where
57% of the class gave the right answer. Probably 97% would have found the right
slope from a formula. Figure 1.14b shows the opposite problem. We know the velocity, not the distance. But calculus answers questions about both functions.
Question 3 Which car is going faster at time t = 3/4?
Answer Car C has higher speed. Car D has greater acceleration.
Question 4 If the cars start together, is D catching up to C at the end? Between
t = $ and t = 1, do the cars get closer or further apart?
Answer This time more than half the class got it wrong. You won't but you can see
why they did. You have to look at the speed graph and imagine the distance graph.
.
When car C is going faster, the distance between them

1.3 The VelocHy at an Instant

To repeat: The cars start together, but they don't finish together. They reach the
same speed at t = 1, not the same distance. Car C went faster. You really should draw
their distance graphs, to see how they bend.
These problems help to emphasize one more point. Finding the speed (or slope) is
entirely different from finding the distance (or area):
1. To find the slope of the f-graph at a'particular time t, you don't have to know
the whole history.
2. To find the area under the v-graph up to a particular time t, you do have to
know the whole history.
A short record of distance is enough to recover v(t). Point B moves toward point A.
The problem of slope is local-the speed is completely decided by f (t) near point A.
In contrast, a short record of speed is not enough to recover the total distance. We
have to know what the mileage was earlier. Otherwise we can only know the increase
in mileage, not the total.

1.4 Circular Motion
This section introduces completely new distances and velocities-the sines and cosines
from trigonometry. As I write that last word, I ask myself how much trigonometry it
is essential to know. There will be the basic picture of a right triangle, with sides cos t
and sin t and 1. There will also be the crucial equation (cos t)2+ (sin t)2 = 1, which
is Pythagoras' law a' + b2 = c2. The squares of two sides add to the square of the
hypotenuse (and the 1 is really 12). Nothing else is needed immediately. If you don't
know trigonometry, don't stop-an important part can be learned now.
You will recognize the wavy graphs of the sine and cosine. W e intend to Jind the
slopes of those graphs. That can be done without using the formulas for sin(x + y)
and cos (x + y)-which later give the same slopes in a more algebraic way. Here it is
only basic things that are needed.? And anyway, how complicated can a triangle be?
Remark You might think trigonometry is only for surveyors and navigators (people
with triangles). Not at all! By far the biggest applications are to rotation and vibration
and oscillation. It is fantastic that sines and cosines are so perfect for "repeating
motionw-around a circle or up and down.
?Sines and cosines are so important that I added a review of trigonometry in Section 1.5. But
the concepts in this section can be more valuable than formulas.

Our underlying goal is to offer one more example in which the velocity can be
computed by common sense. Calculus is mainly an extension of common sense, but
here that extension is not needed. We will find the slope of the sine curve. The straight
line f = v t was easy and the parabola f = +at2 was harder. The new example also
involves realistic motion, seen every day. We start with circular motion, in which the
position is given and the velocity will be found.
A ball goes around a circle of radius one. The center is at x = 0, y = 0 (the origin).
The x and y coordinates satisfy x 2 y 2 = 12, to keep the ball on the circle. We specify
its position in Figure 1.16a by giving its angle with the horizontal. And we make the
ball travel with constant speed, by requiring that the angle is equal to the time t. The
ball goes counterclockwise. At time 1 it reaches the point where the angle equals 1.
The angle is measured in radians rather than degrees, so a full circle is completed at
t = 271 instead of t = 360.
The ball starts on the x axis, where the angle is zero. Now find it at time t:

+

The ball is at the point where x = cos t and y = sin t.

This is where trigonometry is useful. The cosine oscillates between 1 and - 1, as the
ball goes from far right to far left and back again. The sine also oscillates between 1
and - 1, starting from sin 0 = 0. At time 7112 the sine (the height) increases to one.
The cosine is zero and the ball reaches the top point x = 0, y = 1. At time 71 the cosine
is - 1 and the sine is back to zero-the coordinates are (- 1,O). At t = 271 the circle
is complete (the angle is also 271), and x = cos 27~= 1, y = sin 271 = 0.

I Introduction to Calculus

Important point: The distance around the circle (its circumference) is 2nr = 2n,
because the radius is 1. The ball travels a distance 2n in a time 2n. The speed equals
1. It remains to find the velocity, which involves not only speed but direction.
Degrees vs. radians A full circle is 360 degrees and 271 radians. Therefore

= 57.3 degrees
1 degree = 2711360 radians = .01745 radians
1 radian

= 36012~degrees

Radians were invented to avoid those numbers! The speed is exactly 1, reaching t
radians at time t. The speed would be .01745, if the ball only reached t degrees. The
ball would complete the circle at time T = 360. We cannot accept the division of the
circle into 360 pieces (by whom?), which produces these numbers.
To check degree mode vs. radian mode, verify that sin l o z .017 and sin 1 = 34.
VELOCITY OF THE BALL

At time t, which direction is the ball going? Calculus watches the motion between t
and t + h. For a ball on a string, we don't need calculus-just let go. The direction
of motion is tangent to the circle. With no force to keep it on the circle, the ball goes
oflon a tangent. If the ball is the moon, the force is gravity. If it is a hammer swinging
around on a chain, the force is from the center. When the thrower lets go, the hammer
takes off-and it is an art to pick the right moment. (I once saw a friend hit by a
hammer at MIT. He survived, but the thrower quit track.) Calculus will find that
same tangent direction, when the points at t and t h come close.
The "velocity triangle" is in Figure 1.16b. It is the same as the position triangle,
but rotated through 90". The hypotenuse is tangent to the circle, in the direction the
ball is moving. Its length equals 1 (the speed). The angle t still appears, but now it is
the angle with the vertical. The upward component of velocity is cos t, when the upward
component of position is sin t. That is our common sense calculation, based on a
figure rather than a formula. The rest of this section depends on it-and we check
v = cos t at special points.
At the starting time t = 0, the movement is all upward. The height is sin 0 = 0 and
the upward velocity is cos 0 = 1. At time ~ 1 2the
, ball reaches the top. The height is
sin 4 2 = 1 and the upward velocity is cos n/2 = 0. At that instant the ball is not
moving up or down.
The horizontal velocity contains a minus sign. At first the ball travels to the left.
The value of x is cos t, but the speed in the x direction is - sin t. Half of trigonometry
is in that figure (the good half), and you see how sin2 t + cos2 t = 1 is so basic.
That equation applies to position and velocity, at every time.

+

Application of plane geometry: The right triangles in Figure 1.16 are the same size
and shape. They look congruent and they are-the angle t above the ball equals the
angle t at the center. That is because the three angles at the ball add to 180".
OSCILLATION: UP AND DOWN MOTION

We now use circular motion to study straight-line motion. That line will be the y axis.
Instead of a ball going around a circle, a mass will move up and down. It oscillates
between y = 1 and y = - 1. The mass is the "shadow of the ball," as we explain in a
moment.

1.4 Circular Motion

There is a jumpy oscillation that we do not want, with v = 1 and v = - 1. That
"bang-bang" velocity is like a billiard ball, bouncing between two walls without
slowing down. If the distance between the walls is 2, then at t = 4 the ball is back to
the start. The distance graph is a zigzag (or sawtooth) from Section 1.2.
We prefer a smoother motion. Instead of velocities that jump between 1 and - 1,
a real oscillation slows down to zero and gradually builds up speed again. The mass
is on a spring, which pulls it back. The velocity drops to zero as the spring is fully
stretched. Then v is negative, as the mass goes the same distance in the opposite
direction. Simple harmonic motion is the most important back and forth motion,
while f = vt and f = f at2 are the most important one-way motions.

Fig. 1.1 7 Circular motion of the ball and harmonic motion of the mass (its shadow).

How do we describe this oscillation? The best way is to match it with the ball on
the circle. The height of the ball will be the height of the mass. The "shadow of the
ball" goes up and down, level with the ball. As the ball passes the top of the
circle, the mass stops at the top and starts down. As the ball goes around the bottom,
the mass stops and turns back up the y axis. Halfway up (or down), the speed is 1.
Figure 1.17a shows the mass at a typical time t. The height is y =f (t) = sin t, level
with the ball. This height oscillates between f = 1 and f = - 1. But the mass does not
move with constant speed. The speed of the mass is changing although the speed of
the ball is always 1 . The time for a full cycle is still 2n, but within that cycle the mass
speeds up and slows down. The problem is to find the changing velocity u. Since the
distance is f = sin t, the velocity will be the slope of the sine curve.
THE SLOPE OF THE SINE CURVE

At the top and bottom (t = n/2 and t = 3~12)the ball changes direction and v = 0.
The slope at the top and bottom of the sine curve is zero.? At time zero, when the ball
is going straight up, the slope of the sine curve is v = 1. At t = n, when the ball and
mass and f-graph are going down, the velocity is v = -1. The mass goes fastest at
the center. The mass goes slowest (in fact it stops) when the height reaches a maximum
or minimum. The velocity triangle yields v at every time t.
To find the upward velocity of the mass, look at the upward velocity of the ball.
Those velocities are the same! The mass and ball stay level, and we know v from
circular motion: The upward velocity is v = cos t.
?That looks easy but you will see later that it is extremely important. At a maximum or
minimum the slope is zero. The curve levels off.

1 Introduction to Calculus

Figure 1.18 shows the result we want. On the right, f = sin t gives the height. On
the left is the velocity v = cos t. That velocity is the slope of the f-curve. The height
and velocity (red lines) are oscillating together, but they are out of phase-just as
the position triangle and velocity triangle were at right angles. This is absolutely
fantastic, that in calculus the two most famous functions of trigonometry form a pair:
The slope of the sine curve is given by the cosine curve.
When the distance is f (t) = sin t, the velocity is v(t) = cos t .

Admission of guilt: The slope of sin t was not computed in the standard way.
Previously we compared (t + h)' with t2,and divided that distance by h. This average
velocity approached the slope 2t as h became small. For sin t we could have done the
same:
change in sin t - sin (t + h) - sin t
average velocity =
(1)
change in t
h
This is where we need the formula for sin (t + h), coming soon. Somehow the ratio in
(1) should approach cosmtas h -,0. (It d,oes.)The sine and cosine fit the same pattern
as t2 and 2 t o u r shortcut was to watch the shadow of motion around a circle.

Fig. 1.I 8 v = cos t when f = sin t (red); v = -sin t when f = cos t (black).

Question 1

What if the ball goes twice as fast, to reach angle 2t at time t?

Answer The speed is now 2. The time for a full circle is only n. The ball's position
is x = cos 2t and y = sin 2t. The velocity is still tangent to the circle-but the tangent
is at angle 2t where the ball is. Therefore cos 2t enters the upward velocity and
-sin 2t enters the horizontal velocity. The difference is that the velocity triangle is
twice as big. The upward velocity is not cos 2t but 2 cos 2t. The horizontal velocity
is - 2 sin 2t. Notice these 2's!
Question 2

What is the area under the cosine curve from t

=0

to t = n/2?

You can answer that, if you accept the Fundamental Theorem of Calculuscomputing areas is the opposite of computing slopes. The slope of sin t is cos t, so the
area under cos t is the increase in sin t. No reason to believe that yet, but we use it
anyway.
From sin 0 = 0 to sin n/2 = 1, the increase is 1. Please realize the power of calculus.
No other method could compute the area under a cosine curve so fast.

1.4 Circular Motion

THE SLOPE OF THE COSINE,CURVE

I cannot resist uncovering another distance and velocity (another f-v pair) with no
extra work. This time f is the cosine. The time clock starts at the top of the circle.
The old time t = n/2 is now t = 0.The dotted lines in Figure 1.18 show the new start.
But the shadow has exactly the same motion-the ball keeps going around the circle,
and the mass follows it up and down. The f-graph and v-graph are still correct, both
with a time shift of 4 2 .
The new f-graph is the cosine. The new v-graph is minus the sine. The slope of the
cosine curve follows the negative of the sine curve. That is another famous pair, twins
of the first:
When the distance is f (t) = cos t, the velocity is v(t) = - sin t.

You could see that coming, by watching the ball go left and right (instead of up and
down). Its distance across is f = cos t. Its velocity across is v = - sin t. That twjn pair
completes the calculus in Chapter 1 (trigonometry to come). We review the ideas:
v is the velocity
the slope of the distance curve
the limit of average velocity over a short time
the derivative of f.
f is the distance
the area under the velocity curve
the limit of total distance over many short times
the integral of v.
Differential calculus: Compute v from f .

Integral calculus: Compute f from v.

With constant velocity, f equals vt. With constant acceleration, v = at and f = t a t 2.
In harmonic motion, v = cos t and f = sin t . One part of our goal is to extend that
list-for which we need the tools of calculus. Another and more important part is
to put these ideas to use.
Before the chapter ends, may I add a note about the book and the course? The
book is more personal than usual, and I hope readers will approve. What I write is
very close to what I would say, if you were in this room. The sentences are spoken
before they are written.? Calculus is alive and moving forward-it needs to be taught
that way.
One new part of the subject has come with the computer. It works with a finite
step h, not an "infinitesimal" limit. What it can do, it does quickly-even if it cannot
find exact slopes or areas. The result is an overwhelming growth in the range of
problems that can be solved. We landed on the moon because f and v were so
accurate. (The moon's orbit has sines and cosines, the spacecraft starts with v = at
and f = )at2. Only the computer can account for the atmosphere and the sun's gravity
and the changing mass of the spacecraft.) Modern mathematics is a combination of
exact formulas and approximate computations. Neither part can be ignored, and I
hope you will see numerically what we derive algebraically. The exercises are to help
you master both parts.

t o n television you know immediately when the words are live. The same with writing.

I lntroductlon to Calculus

The course has made a quick start-not with an abstract discussion of sets or
functions or limits, but with the concrete questions that led to those ideas. You have
seen a distance function f and a limit v of average velocities. We will meet more
functions and more limits (and their definitions!) but it is crucial to study important
examples early. There is a lot to do, but the course has definitely begun.

1.5 A Review of Trigonometry
Trigonometry begins with a right triangle. The size of the triangle is not as important
as the angles. We focus on one particular angle-call it 8-and on the ratios between
the three sides x, y, r. The ratios don't change if the triangle is scaled to another
size. Three sides give six ratios, which are the basic functions of trigonometry:

sin 8

Of course those six ratios are not independent. The three on the right come directly
from the three on the left. And the tangent is the sine divided by the cosine:

Note that "tangent of an angle" and "tangent to a circle" and "tangent line to a
graph" are different uses of the same word. As the cosine of 8 goes to zero, the tangent
of 8 goes to infinity. The side x becomes zero, 8 approaches 90", and the triangle is
infinitely steep. The sine of 90" is y/r = 1.
Triangles have a serious limitation. They are excellent for angles up to 90°, and
they are OK up to 180", but after that they fail. We cannot put a 240" angle into a
triangle. Therefore we change now to a circle.

1 Introduction to Calculus

Fig. 1.20 Trigonometry on a circle. Compare 2 sin 8 with sin 28 and tan 8 (periods 2n, n, n).

Angles are measured from the positive x axis (counterclockwise). Thus 90" is
straight up, 180" is to the left, and 360" is in the same direction as 0". (Then 450" is
the same as 90°.) Each angle yields a point on the circle of radius r. The coordinates
x and y of that point can be negative (but never r). As the point goes around the
circle, the six ratios cos 8, sin 9, tan 8, ... trace out six graphs. The cosine waveform
is the same as the sine waveform-just shifted by 90".
One more change comes with the move to a circle. Degrees are out. Radians are
in. The distance around the whole circle is 2nr. The distance around to other points
is Or. We measure the angle by that multiple 8. For a half-circle the distance is m,
so the angle is n radians-which is 180". A quarter-circle is 4 2 radians or 90".
The distance around to angle 8 is r times 8.
When r = 1 this is the ultimate in simplicity: The distance is 8. A 45" angle is Q of
a circle and 27118 radians-and the length of the circular arc is 27~18.Similarly for 1":

360" = 2n radians

1" = 27~1360radians

1 radian = 3601271 degrees.

4

An angle going clockwise is negative. The angle - n / 3 is - 60" and takes us of the
wrong way around the circle. What is the effect on the six functions?
Certainly the radius r is not changed when we go to - 8. Also x is not changed
(see Figure 1.20a). But y reverses sign, because - 8 is below the axis when + 8 is
above. This change in y affects y/r and y / x but not xlr:
The cosine is even (no change). The sine and tangent are odd (change sign).
The same point is 2 of the right way around. Therefore 2 of 2n radians (or 300")
gives the same direction as - n / 3 radians or - 60". A diflerence of 2n makes no
di$erence to x, y, r. Thus sin 8 and cos 8 and the other four functions have period 27~.
We can go five times or a hundred times around the circle, adding 10n or 200n to
the angle, and the six functions repeat themselves.
EXAMPLE Evaluate the six trigonometric functions at 8 = 2n/3 (or 8 = - 4 4 3 ) .

This angle is shown in Figure 1.20a (where r = 1). The ratios are
cos 8 = x/r = - 1/2

sin 8 = y/r = &/2

tan 8 = y / x = -

sec e = - 2

csc e = 2/&

cot

&

e = -i/d

Those numbers illustrate basic facts about the sizes of four functions:
The tangent and cotangent can fall anywhere, as long as cot 8 = l/tan 8.

1.5 A Review of Ttlgonometry

3

The numbers reveal more. The tangent is the ratio of sine to cosine. The
secant -2 is l/cos 8. Their squares are 3 and 4 (differing by 1). That may not seem
remarkable, but it is. There are three relationships in the squares of those six numbers,
and they are the key identities of trigonometry:
Everything flows fvom the Pythagoras formula x2 + y2 = r2. Dividing by r2 gives
= 1. That is cos2 8 + sin2 8 = 1. Dividing by x2 gives the second identity,
( ~ / r ) (y/r)2
~
~.
by y2 gives the third. All three will be needed
which is 1 + ( y / ~=) (~r / ~ )Dividing
throughout the book-and the first one has to be unforgettable.

+

DISTANCES AND ADDITION FORMULAS

To compute the distance between points we stay with Pythagoras. The points are in
Figure 1.21a. They are known by their x and y coordinates, and d is the distance
between them. The third point completes a right triangle.
For the x distance along the bottom we don't need help. It is x, - xl (or Ix2 - x1 I
since distances can't be negative). The distance up the side is ly2 - y, 1. Pythagoras
immediately gives the distance d:

y = sin s

Fig. 1.21 Distance between points and equal distances in two circles.

By applying this distance formula in two identical circles, we discover the cosine
of s - t. (Subtracting angles is important.) In Figure 1.21b, the distance squared is

(2)
Figure 1 . 2 1 ~shows the same circle and triangle (but rotated). The same distance
squared is
d2 = (cos (s - t) - + (sin (s - t))2.
(3)
Now multiply out the squares in equations (2) and (3). Whenever ( c o ~ i n e+
) ~(sine)2
appears, replace it by 1. The distances are the same, so (2) = (3):
(2) = 1 + 1 - 2 cos s cos t - 2 sin s sin t

1 Introduction to Calculus

After canceling 1 + 1 and then - 2, we have the "additionformula" for cos (s - t):
The cosine of s - t equals cos s cos t + sin s sin t.

(4)

The cosine of s + t equals cos s cos t - sin s sin t.

(5)

The easiest is t = 0. Then cos t = 1 and sin t = 0. The equations reduce to cos s = cos s.
To go from (4) to (5) in all cases, replace t by - t. No change in cos t, but a "minus"
appears with the sine. In the special case s = t, we have cos(t + t ) =
(COSt)(cos t) - (sin t)(sin t). This is a much-used formula for cos 2t:

Double angle: cos 2t = cos2 t - sin2 t = 2 cos2 t - 1 = 1 - 2 sin2 t.

(6)

I am constantly using cos2 t + sin2t = 1, to switch between sines and cosines.
We also need addition formulas and double-angle formulas for the sine of s - t
and s + t and 2t. For that we connect sine to cosine, rather than (sine)2 to (co~ine)~.
The connection goes back to the ratio y/r in our original triangle. This is the sine of
the angle 0 and also the cosine of the complementary angle 7112 - 0:
sin 0 = cos (7112 - 0)

and

cos 0 = sin (7112 - 0).

(7)

The complementary angle is 7112 - 0 because the two angles add to 7112 (a right angle).
By making this connection in Problem 19, formulas (4-5-6) move from cosines to
sines:
sin (s - t) = sin s cos t - cos s sin t
(8)

+ t) = sin s cos t + cos s sin t
sin 2t = sin(t + t) = 2 sin t cos t

(10)

I want to stop with these ten formulas, even if more are possible. Trigonometry is
full of identities that connect its six functions-basically because all those functions
come from a single right triangle. The x, y, r ratios and the equation x2 + y2 = r2 can
be rewritten in many ways. But you have now seen the formulas that are needed by
ca1culus.t They give derivatives in Chapter 2 and integrals in Chapter 5. And it is
typical of our subject to add something of its own-a limit in which an angle
approaches zero. The essence of calculus is in that limit.

1.5 EXERCISES
Read-through questions
Starting with a a triangle, the six basic functions are the
b
of the sides. Two ratios (the cosine x/r and the c )
are below 1. Two ratios (the secant r/x and the d ) are
above 1. Two ratios (the e and the f ) can take any
value. The six functions are defined for all angles 8, by changing from a triangle to a g .
The angle 8 is measured in h . A full circle is 8 = i ,
when the distance around is 2nr. The distance to angle 8 is
I . All six functions have period k . Going clockwise
changes the sign of 8 and I and m . Since cos (- 9) =
cos 8, the cosine is n .
Coming from x2 + y2 = r2 are the three identities
sin28 + cos28 = 1 and 0 and P . (Divide by r2 and
q
and
r .) The distance from (2, 5) to (3, 4) is
d = s . The distance from (1, 0) to (cos (s - t), sin (s - t))
leads to the addition formula cos (s - t) = t . Changing
the sign of t gives cos (s + t) = u . Choosing s = t gives
cos 2t = v
or w . Therefore i ( l + cos 2t) = x ,
a formula needed in calculus.

1.6 A Thousand Points of Light

-1

The graphs on the back cover of the book show y = sin n. This is very different
from y = sin x. The graph of sin x is one continuous curve. By the time it reaches
x = 10,000, the curve has gone up and down 10,000/27r times. Those 1591 oscillations
would be so crowded that you couldn't see anything. The graph of sin n has picked
10,000 points from the curve-and for some reason those points seem to lie on more
than 40 separate sine curves.
The second graph shows the first 1000 points. They don't seem to lie on sine curves.
Most people see hexagons. But they are the same thousand points! It is hard to believe
that the graphs are the same, but I have learned what to do. Tilt the second graph
and look from the side at a narrow angle. Now the first graph appears. You see
"diamonds." The narrow angle compresses the x axis-back to the scale of the first
graph.

The effect of scale is something we don't think of. We understand it for maps.
Computers can zoom in or zoom out-those are changes of scale. What our eyes see

1.6 A Thousand Points of Light

depends on what is "close." We think we see sine curves in the 10,000 point graph,
and they raise several questions:
1. Which points are near (0, O)?
2. How many sine curves are there?
3. Where does the middle curve, going upward from (0, 0), come back to zero?
A point near (0,O) really means that sin n is close to zero. That is certainly not true
of sin 1 (1 is one radian!). In fact sin 1 is up the axis at .84, at the start of the seventh
sine curve. Similarly sin 2 is .91 and sin 3 is .14. (The numbers 3 and .14 make us
think of n. The sine of 3 equals the sine of n - 3. Then sin .l4 is near .14.) Similarly
sin 4, sin 5, ... , sin 21 are not especially close to zero.
The first point to come close is sin 22. This is because 2217 is near n. Then 22 is
close to 771, whose sine is zero:
sin 22 = sin (7n - 22) z sin (- .01) z - .01.
That is the first point to the right of (0,O) and slightly below. You can see it on
graph 1, and more clearly on graph 2. It begins a curve downward.
The next point to come close is sin 44. This is because 44 is just past 14n.
44 z 14n + .02

so

sin 44 z sin .02 z .02.

This point (44, sin 44) starts the middle sine curve. Next is (88, sin 88).
Now we know something. There are 44 curves. They begin near the heights sin 0,
sin 1, ... , sin 43. Of these 44 curves, 22 start upward and 22 start downward. I was
confused at first, because I could only find 42 curves. The reason is that sin 11 equals
- 0.99999 and sin 33 equals .9999. Those are so close to the bottom and top that you
can't see their curves. The sine of 11 is near - 1 because sin 22 is near zero. It is
almost impossible to follow a single curve past the top-coming back down it is not
the curve you think it is.
The points on the middle curve are at n = 0 and 44 and 88 and every number 44N.
Where does that curve come back to zero? In other words, when does 44N come
very close to a multiple of n? We know that 44 is 14n + .02. More exactly 44 is
14n + .0177. So we multiply .0177 until we reach n:

if N=n/.0177

then 44N=(14n+.0177)N3 14nN+n.

This gives N = 177.5. At that point 44N = 7810. This is half the period of the sine
curve. The sine of 7810 is very near zero.
If you follow the middle sine curve, you will see it come back to zero above 7810.
The actual points on that curve have n = 44 177 and n = 44 178, with sines just
above and below zero. Halfway between is n = 7810. The equation for the middle sine
curve is y = sin (nx/78lO). Its period is 15,620-beyond our graph.
Question The fourth point on that middle curve looks the same as the fourth point

coming down from sin 3. What is this "double point?"
Answer 4 times 44 is 176. On the curve going up, the point is (176, sin 176). On the
curve coming down it is (179, sin 179). The sines of 176 and 179 difler only by .00003.
The second graph spreads out this double point. Look above 176 and 179, at the
center of a hexagon. You can follow the sine curve all the way across graph 2.
Only a little question remains. Why does graph 2 have hexagons? I don't know.
The problem is with your eyes. To understand the hexagons, Doug Hardin plotted
points on straight lines as well as sine curves. Graph 3 shows y = fractional part of
n/2x. Then he made a second copy, turned it over, and placed it on top. That
produced graph 4-with hexagons. Graphs 3 and 4 are on the next page.

36

1 Introduction to Calculus

This is called a Moivt pattevn. If you can get a transparent copy of graph 3, and
turn it slowly over the original, you will see fantastic hexagons. They come from
interference between periodic patterns-in our case 4417 and 2514 and 1913 are near
271. This interference is an enemy of printers, when color screens don't line up. It can
cause vertical lines on a TV. Also in making cloth, operators get dizzy from seeing
Moire patterns move. There are good applications in engineering and optics-but
we have to get back to calculus.

1.7 Computing in Calculus
Software is available for calculus courses-a lot of it. The packages keep getting
better. Which program to use (if any) depends on cost and convenience and purpose.
How to use it is a much harder question. These pages identify some of the goals, and
also particular packages and calculators. Then we make a beginning (this is still
Chapter 1) on the connection of computing to calculus.
The discussion will be informal. It makes no sense to copy the manual. Our aim
is to support, with examples and information, the effort to use computing to help
learning.
For calculus, the gveatest advantage of the computev is to o$er graphics. You see
the function, not just the formula. As you watch, f ( x ) reaches a maximum or a
minimum or zero. A separate graph shows its derivative. Those statements are not
100% true, as everybody learns right away-as soon as a few functions are typed in.
But the power to see this subject is enormous, because it is adjustable. If we don't
like the picture we change to a new viewing window.
This is computer-based graphics. It combines numerical computation with
gvaphical computation. You get pictures as well as numbers-a powerful combination.
The computer offers the experience of actually working with a function. The domain
and range are not just abstract ideas. You choose them. May I give a few examples.
Certainly x3 equals 3" when x = 3. Do those graphs ever meet again'?
At this point we don't know the full meaning of 3", except when x is a nice number.
(Neither does the computer.) Checking at x = 2 and 4, the function x 3 is smaller
both times: 23 is below 3* and 43 = 64 is below 34 = 81. If x3 is always less than 3"
we ought to know-these are among the basic functions of mathematics.

EXAMPLE I

1.7 Computing in Calculus

The computer will answer numerically or graphically. At our command, it solves
x3 = 3X.At another command, it plots both functions-this shows more. The screen
proves a point of logic (or mathematics) that escaped us. If the graphs cross once,
they must cross again-because 3" is higher at 2 and 4. A crossing point near 2.5 is
seen by zooming in. I am less interested in the exact number than its position-it
comes before x = 3 rather than after.
A few conclusions from such a basic example:

1. A supercomputer is not necessary.
2. High-level programming is not necessary.
3. We can do mathematics without completely understanding it.
The third point doesn't sound so good. Write it differently: We can learn mathematics
while doing it. The hardest part of teaching calculus is to turn it from a spectator
sport into a workout. The computer makes that possible.
EXAMPLE 2 (mental computer) Compare x2 with 2X.The functions meet at x = 2.
Where do they meet again? Is it before or after 2?

That is mental computing because the answer happens to be a whole number (4).
Now we are on a different track. Does an accident like Z4 = 42 ever happen again?
Can the machine tell us about integers? Perhaps it can plot the solutions of xb = bx.
I asked Mathernatica for a formula, hoping to discover x as a function of b-but the
program just gave back the equation. For once the machine typed HELP icstead of
the user.
Well, mathematics is not helpless. I am proud of calculus. There is a new exercise
at the end of Section 6.4, to show that we never see whole numbers again.
EXAMPLE 3

Find the number b for which xb = bx has only one solution(at x = b).

When b is 3, the second solution is below 3. When b is 2, the second solution (4) is
above 2. If we move b from 2 to 3, there must be a special "double point"-where
the graphs barely touch but don't cross. For that particular b-and only for that
one value-the curve xb never goes above bx.
This special point b can be found with computer-based graphics. In many ways it
is the "center point of calculus." Since the curves touch but don't cross, they are
tangent. They have the same slope at the double point. Calculus was created to work
with slopes, and we already know the slope of x2. Soon comes xb. Eventually we
discover the slope of bx, and identify the most important number in calculus.
The point is that this number can be discovered first by experiment.
EXAMPLE 4

Graph y(x) = ex - xe. Locate its minimum.

+

The next example was proposed by Don Small. Solve x4 - 1 l x 3 5x - 2 = 0.The
first tool is algebra-try to factor the polynomial. That succeeds for quadratics, and
then gets extremely hard. Even if the computer can do algebra better than we can,
factoring is seldom the way to go. In reality we have two good choices:
1. (Mathematics)Use the derivative. Solve by Newton's method.
2. (Graphics)Plot the function and zoom in.

Both will be done by the computer. Both have potential problems! Newton's method
is fast, but that means it can fail fast. (It is usually terrific.) Plotting the graph is also
fast-but solutions can be outside the viewing window. This particular function is

1 lntroductlonto Calculus

zero only once, in the standard window from -10 to 10. The graph seems to be
leaving zero, but mathematics again predicts a second crossing point. So we zoom
out before we zoom in.
The use of the zoom is the best part of graphing. Not only do we choose the domain
and range, we change them. The viewing window is controlled by four numbers. They
can be the limits A < x < B and C d y d D. They can be the coordinates of two
opposite corners: (A, C) and (B, D). They can be the center position (a, b) and the
scale factors c and d. Clicking on opposite corners of the zoom box is the fastest way,
unless the center is unchanged and we only need to give scale factors. (Even faster:
Use the default factors.) Section 3.4 discusses the centering transform and zoom
transform-a change of picture on the screen and a change of variable within the
function.
EXAMPLE 5

+

Find all real solutions to x4 - 1lx3 5x - 2 = 0.

EXAMPLE 6 Zoom out and in on the graphs of y = cos 40x and y = x sin (llx).

Describe what you see.
What does y = (tan x - sin x)/x3 become at x = O? For small x the
machine eventually can't separate tan x from sin x. It may give y = 0. Can you get
close enough to see the limit of y?

U(AMpLE 7

For these examples, and for most computer exercises in this book, a menu-driven
system is entirely adequate. There is a list of commands to choose from. The user
provides a formula for y(x), and many functions are built in. A calculus supplement
can be very useful-MicroCalc or True BASIC or Exploring Calculus or MPP (in
the public domain). Specific to graphics are Surface Plotter and Master Grapher and
Gyrographics (animated). The best software for linear algebra is MATLAB.
Powerful packages are increasing in convenience and decreasing in cost. They are
capable of symbolic computation-which opens up a third avenue of computing in
calculus.
SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION

In symbolic computation, answers can be formulas as well as numbers and graphs.
The derivative of y = x2 is seen as "2x." The derivative of sin t is "cos t." The slope
of bx is known to the program. The computer does more than substitute numbers
into formulas-it operates directly on the formulas. We need to think where this fits
with learning calculus.
In a way, symbolic computing is close to what we ourselves do. Maybe too closethere is some danger that symbolic manipulation is all we do. With a higher-level
language and enough power, a computer can print the derivative of sin(x2). So why
learn the chain rule? Because mathematics goes deeper than "algebra with formulas."
We deal with ideas.
I want to say clearly: Mathematics is not formulas, or computations, or even proofs,
but ideas. The symbols and pictures are the language. The book and the professor
and the computer can join in teaching it. The computer should be non-threatening
(like this book and your professor)-you can work at your own pace. Your part is
to learn by doing.
EXAMPLE 8 A computer algebra system quickly finds 100 factorial. This is loo! =

(100)(99)(98)... (1). The number has 158 digits (not written out here). The last 24

1.7 Computing In Calculus

digits are zeros. For lo! = 3628800 there are seven digits and two zeros. Between 10
and 100, and beyond, are simple questions that need ideas:
1. How many digits (approximately) are in the number N!?
2. How many zeros (exactly) are at the end of N!?

For Question 1, the computer shows more than N digits when N = 100. It will never
show more than N2 digits, because none of the N terms can have more than N digits.
A much tighter bound would be 2N, but is it true? Does N! always have fewer than
2N digits?
For Question 2, the zeros in lo! can be explained. One comes from 10, the other
from 5 times 2. (10 is also 5 times 2.) Can you explain the 24 zeros in loo!? An idea
from the card game blackjack applies here too: Count the$ves.
Hard question: How many zeros at the end of 200!?
The outstanding package for full-scale symbolic computation is Mathematica. It
was used to draw graphs for this book, including y = sin n on the back cover. The
complete command was List Plot [Table [Sin [n], (n, 10000)]]. This system has rewards
and also drawbacks, including the price. Its original purpose, like MathCAD and
MACSYMA and REDUCE, was not to teach calculus-but it can. The computer
algebra system MAPLE is good.
A s I write in 1990, DERIVE is becoming well established for the PC. For the
Macintosh, Calculus TIL is a "sleeper" that deserves to be widely known. It builds
on MAPLE and is much more accessible for calculus. An important alternative is
Theorist. These are menu-driven (therefore easier at the start) and not expensive.
I strongly recommend that students share terminals and work together. Two at a
terminal and 3-5 in a working group seems to be optimal. Mathematics can be
learned by talking and writing-it is a human activity. Our goal is not to test but to
teach and learn.
Writing in Calculus May I emphasize the importance of writing? We totally miss it,
when the answer is just a number. A one-page report is harder on instructors as well
as students-but much more valuable. A word processor keeps it neat. You can't
write sentences without being forced to organize ideas-and part of yourself goes
into it.
I will propose a writing exercise with options. If you have computer-based graphing, follow through on Examples 1-4 above and report. Without a computer, pick a
paragraph from this book that should be clearer and make it clearer. Rewrite it with
examples. Identify the key idea at the start, explain it, and come back to express it
differently at the end. Ideas are like surfaces-they can be seen many ways.
Every reader will understand that in software there is no last word. New packages
keep coming (Analyzer and EPIC among them). The biggest challenges at this
moment are three-dimensional graphics and calculus workbooks. In 30, the problem
is the position of the eye-since the screen is only 20. In workbooks, the problem is
to get past symbol manipulation and reach ideas. Every teacher, including this one,
knows how hard that is and hopes to help.
GRAPHING CALCULATORS

The most valuable feature for calculus-computer-based graphing-is available on
hand calculators. With trace and zoom their graphs are quite readable. By creating
the graphs you subconsciously learn about functions. These are genuinely personal
computers, and the following pages aim to support and encourage their use.

1 Introduction to Calculus

Programs for a hand-held machine tend to be simple and short. We don't count
the zeros in 100 factorial (probably we could). A calculator finds crossing points and
maximum points to good accuracy. Most of all it allows you to explore calculus by
yourself. You set the viewing window and define the function. Then you see it.
There is a choice of calculators-which one to buy? For this book there was also
a choice-which one to describe? To provide you with listings for useful programs,
we had to choose. Fortunately the logic is so clear that you can translate the instructions into any language-for a computer as well as a calculator. The programs given
here are the "greatest common denominator" of computing in calculus.
The range of choices starts with the Casio fx 7000G-the first and simplest, with
very limited memory but a good screen. The Casio 7500,8000, and 8500 have increasing memory and extra features. The Sharp EL-5200 (or 9000 in Canada and Europe)
is comparable to the Casio 8000. These machines have algebraic entry-the normal
order as in y = x + 3. They are inexpensive and good. More expensive and much
more powerful are the Hewlett-Packard calculators-the HP-28s and HP-48SX.
They have large memories and extensive menus (and symbolic algebra). They use
reverse Polish notation-numbers first in the stack, then commands. They require
extra time and effort, and other books do justice to their amazing capabilities. It is
estimated that those calculators could get 95 on a typical calculus exam.
While this book was being written, Texas Instruments produced a new graphing
calculator: the TI-81. It is closer to the Casio and Sharp (emphasis on graphing, easy
to learn, no symbolic algebra, moderate price). With earlier machines as a starting
point, many improvements were added. There is some risk in a choice that is available
only At before this textbook is published, and we hope that the experts we asked are
right. Anyway, our programs are Jbr the TI-81. It is impressive.
These few pages are no substitute for the manual that comes with a calculator. A
valuable supplement is a guide directed especially at calculus-my absolute favorites
are Calculus Activitiesfor Graphic Calculators by Dennis Pence (PWS-Kent, 1990 for
the Casio and Sharp and HP-28S, 1991 for the TI-81). A series of Calculator Enhancements, using HP's, is being published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. What follows
is an introduction to one part of a calculus laboratory. Later in the book, we supply
TI-81 programs close to the mathematics and the exercises that they are prepared
for.
A few words to start: To select from a menu, press the item number and E N T E R .
Edit a command line using D E L(ete) and I N S(ert). Every line ends with
E N T E R . For calculus select radians on the M 0 D E screen. For powers use * . For
Multiplication has priority, so (-)3 + 2 x 2
special powers choose x2, x - l ,
produces 1. Use keys for S I N , I F , I S, .. . When you press letters, I multiplies S .
If a program says 3 + C , type 3 S T 0 C E N T E R . Storage locations are A to Z
or Greek 8.

&.

Functions A graphing calculator helps you (forces you?) to understand the concept
of a function. It also helps you to understand specific functions-especially when
changing the viewing window.
To evaluate y = x2 - 2x just once, use the home screen. To define y(x) for repeated
use, move to the function edit screen: Press M 0 D E, choose F u n c t i o n, and press
Y =. Then type in the formula. Important tip: for X on the TI-81, the key X I T is faster
than two steps A L p h a X. The Y = edit screen is the same place where the formula
is needed for graphing.

screen. Y 1 E N T E R on the Y-VARS screen. The screen shows 8, which is Y(4). The
formula remains when the calculator is off.
Graphing You specify the X range and Y range. (We should say X domain but we
don't.) The screen is a grid of 96 x 64 little rectangles called "pixels." The first column
of pixels represents X m i n and the last column is X m a x . Press R A N G E to reset.
With X r e s = 1 the function is evaluated 96 times as it is graphed. X s c L and Y s c L
give the spaces between ticks on the axes.
The Z 0 0 M menu is a fast way to set ranges. Z 0 0 M S t a n d a r d gives the default
-1O<x<10, -10<y<10. Z O O M T r i g gives - 2 n < x < h , - 3 < y < 3 .
The keystroke G R A P H shows the graphing screen with the current functions.
Example Set the ranges (-)2 < X < 3 and (-) 150 < Y 6 50. Press Y = and store
Y1 = X (in ~ A T H ) ~ - 2 8 X ~ + l 5 ~ E+N3T6E R . Press GRAPH. You won't see
much of the graph! Press R A N G E and reset (-)I 0 < X < 30, (-)4000 < Y < 2300.
Press G R A P H. See a cubic polynomial.
"Smart Graph" recalls the graph instantly without redrawing it, if no settings have
changed. The D R A W menu is for points, lines, and shaded regions. This is perfect for
our piecewise linear functions-just connect the breakpoints with lines. In Section 3.6
the lines show an iteration by its "cobweb."
Programming This book contains programs that you can type in once and save.
We chose Autoscaling, Newton's Method, Secant Method, Cobweb Iteration, and
Numerical Integration. You will create others-to do calculations or to add features
that are not available as single keystrokes. The calculator is like a computer, with a
fairly small set of instructions. One digerence: Memory is too precious to store comments with the code. You have to see the logic by rereading the program.
To enter the world of programming, press P R G M. Each P R G M submenu lists all
programs by name-a digit, a letter, or 6 (37 names). The program title has up to
eight characters. Select the E D I T submenu and press G for the edit screen. Type the
title G R A P H S and press E N T E R. Practice on this one:

To execute, press P R G M ( E X E C G E N T E R. The program draws the graphs. It

Piecewise functions and Input (to a running program). The definition of a piecewise
function includes the domain of each piece. Logical tests like " I F X 2 7 " determine
which domain the input value X falls into. An I F statement only affects the following
line-which is executed when T E S T = 1 (meaning true) and skipped when T E S T = 0
(meaning false). I F commands are in the P R G M ( C T L submenu; T E S T calls the
menu of inequalities.

TRACE and ZOOM The best feature is graphing. But a whole graph can be like a
whole book-too much at once. You want to focus on one part. A computer or
calculator will trace along the graph, stop at a point, and zoom in.
There is also Z 0 0 M 0 U T, to widen the ranges and see more. Our eyes work the
same way-they put together information on different scales. Looking around the
room uses an amazingly large part of the human brain. With a big enough computer
we can try to imitate the eyes-this is a key problem in artificial intelligence. With
a small computer and a zoom feature, we can use our eyes to understand functions.
Press T R A C E to locate a point on the graph. A blinking cursor appears. Move
left or right-the cursor stays on the graph. Its coordinates appear at the bottom of
the screen. When x changes by a pixel, the calculator evaluates y(x). To solve y(x) = 0,
read off x at the point when y is nearest to zero. To minimize or maximize y(x), read
off the smallest and largest y. In all these problems, zoom in for more accuracy.
To blow up a figure we can choose new ranges. The fast way is to use a Z 0 0 M
command. Forapresetrange,use Z O O M S t a n d a r d or Z O O M T r ig.Toshrink

Choose the center point and press E N T E R. The new graph appears. Change those
scaling factors with Z 0 0 M S e t F a c t o r s . Best of all, create your own viewing
window. Press Z 0 0 M B o x .
To draw the box, move the cursor to one corner. Press E N T E R and this point is
a small square. The same keys move a second (blinking) square to the opposite
corner-the box grows as you move. Press E N T E R, and the box is the new viewing
window. The graphs show the same function with a change of scale. Section 3.4 will
discuss the mathematics-here we concentrate on the graphics.

Scaling is crucial. For a new function it can be tedious. A formula for y(x) does
not easily reveal the range of y's, when A < x < B is given. The following program is
often more convenient than zooms. It samples the function L= 19 times across the
x-range (every 5 pixels). The inputs Xmin, Xmax, Y, are previously stored on other
screens. After sampling, the program sets the y-range from C = Ymin to D = Ymax
and draws the graph.
Notice the loop with counter K. The loop ends with the command I S > ( K ,L ,
which increases K by 1 and skips a line if the new K exceeds L. Otherwise the
command G o t o 1 restarts the loop. The screen shows the short form on the left.

Derivatives

2.1 The Derivative of a Function
This chapter begins with the definition of the derivative. Two examples were in
Chapter 1. When the distance is t 2 , the velocity is 2t. When f ( t ) = sin t we found
v(t)= cos t. The velocity is now called the derivative o f f (t). As we move to a more
formal definition and new examples, we use new symbols f' and dfldt for the
derivative.
2A At time t , the derivative f ' ( t )or df /dt or v ( t ) is

f ' ( t )= lim

f Ct -t At) -f (0

(1)

At

At+O

The ratio on the right is the average velocity over a short time At. The derivative, on
the left side, is its limit as the step At (delta t ) approaches zero.
G o slowly and look at each piece. The distance at time t + At is f (t At). The
distance at time t is f(t). Subtraction gives the change in distance, between those
times. We often write Af for this difference: Af =f (t At) -f (t). The average velocity
is the ratio AflAt-change in distance divided by change in time.
The limit of the average velocity is the derivative, if this limit exists:

+

+

df -dt

Af
lim -.
At

At-0

This is the neat notation that Leibniz invented: Af/At approaches df /dt. Behind the
innocent word "limit" is a process that this course will help you understand.
Note that Af is not A times f ! It is the change in f . Similarly At is not A times t.
It is the time step, positive or negative and eventually small. To have a one-letter
symbol we replace At by h.
The right sides of (1) and (2) contain average speeds. On the graph of f ( t ) , the
distance up is divided by the distance across. That gives the average slope Af /At.
The left sides of ( 1 ) and (2)are instantaneous speeds dfldt. They give the slope at
the instant t. This is the derivative dfldt (when At and Af shrink to zero). Look again

2.1 The Derivative of a Function

at the calculation for f(t) = t 2:
Af-- f(t+At)-f(t) - t2+2tAt+(At)'-t2
At
At
At

= 2t

+ At.

Important point: Those steps are taken before At goes to zero. If we set At = 0 too
soon, we learn nothing. The ratio Af/At becomes 010 (which is meaningless). The
numbers Af and At must approach zero together, not separately. Here their ratio is
2t At, the average speed.
To repeat: Success came by writing out (t + At)2 and subtracting t2 and dividing
by At. Then and only then can we approach At = 0. The limit is the derivative 2t.

+

There are several new things in formulas (1) and (2). Some are easy but important,
others are more profound. The idea of a function we will come back to, and the
definition of a limit. But the notations can be discussed right away. They are used
constantly and you also need to know how to read them aloud:
f (t) = "f of t" = the value of the function f at time t
At = "delta t"
f (t

= the

time step forward or backward from t

+ At) = "f of t plus delta t" = the value off at time t + At
Af = "delta f" = the change f (t + At) -f (t)

Af/At

= "delta

f over delta t"

= the

average velocity

ff(t) = "f prime of t" = the value of the derivative at time t
df /dt = "d f d t" = the same as f ' (the instantaneous velocity)
lim

At+O

= "limit

as delta t goes to zero" = the process that starts with
numbers Af /At and produces the number df /dt.

From those last words you see what lies behind the notation dfldt. The symbol At
indicates a nonzero (usually short) length of time. The symbol dt indicates an
infinitesimal (even shorter) length of time. Some mathematicians work separately
with df and dt, and df/dt is their ratio. For us dfldt is a single notation (don't
cancel d and don't cancel A). The derivative dfldt is the limit of AflAt. When that
notation dfldt is awkward, use f ' or v.
Remark The notation hides one thing we should mention. The time step can be
negative just as easily as positive. We can compute the average Af/At over a time
interval before the time t, instead of after. This ratio also approaches dfldt.
The notation also hides another thing: The derivative might not exist. The averages
AflAt might not approach a limit (it has to be the same limit going forward and
backward from time t). In that case ft(t) is not defined. At that instant there is no
clear reading on the speedometer. This will happen in Example 2.
EXAMPLE 1 (Constant velocity V = 2) The distance f is V times t. The distance at
time t + At is V times t At. The diference Af is V times At:

+

Af - VAt
df = V.
---- V so the limit is At
At
dt
The derivative of Vt is V. The derivative of 2t is 2. The averages AflAt are always
V = 2, in this exceptional case of a constant velocity.

2 Derivatives

EXAMPLE 2 Constant velocity 2 up to time t = 3, then stop.

For small times we still have f ( t )= 2t. But after the stopping time, the distance is
fixed at f ( t )= 6 . The graph is flat beyond time 3. Then f (t + At) =f ( t ) and Af = 0
and the derivative of a constant function is zero:
t > 3: f ' ( t )= lim

A~+O

f ( t + At) - f (0 = lim
At

at-o

0
At

- = 0.

In this example the derivative is not defined at the instant when t = 3. The velocity
falls suddenly from 2 to zero. The ratio A f / A t depends, at that special moment, on
whether At is positive or negative. The average velocity after time t = 3 is zero. The
average velocity before that time is 2. When the graph o f f has a corner, the graph
of v has a jump. It is a step function.
One new part of that example is the notation (dfldt or f' instead of v). Please look
also at the third figure. It shows how the function takes t (on the left) to f ( t ) .Especially
it shows At and A f . At the start, A f / A t is 2. After the stop at t = 3, all t's go to the
same f ( t ) = 6 . So Af = 0 and df /dt = 0.

THE DERIVATIVE OF 111

Here is a completely different slope, for the "demand function" f ( t )= lit. The demand
is l / t when the price is t . A high price t means a low demand l l t . Increasing the price
reduces the demand. The calculus question is: How quickly does l / t change when t
changes? The "marginal demand" is the slope of the demand curve.
The big thing is to find the derivative of l / t once and for all. It is - l / t 2 .

Line 1 is algebra, line 2 is calculus. The first step in line 1 subtracts f ( t ) from

f (t + At). The difference is l / ( t + At) minus l / t . The common denominator is t times

t + At-this makes the algebra possible. We can't set At = 0 in line 2, until we have
divided by At.
The average is A f / A t = - l / t ( t + At). Now set At = 0. The derivative is - l / t 2 .
Section 2.4 will discuss the first of many cases when substituting At = 0 is not possible,
and the idea of a limit has to be made clearer.

2.1 The Derhrathre of a Function

Fig. 2.2 Average slope is - &,true slope is - 4. Increase in t produces decrease in f.

Check the algebra at t = 2 and t + At = 3. The demand llt drops from 112 to 113.
The difference is Af = - 116, which agrees with - 1/(2)(3)in line 1. As the steps Af
and At get smaller, their ratio approaches - 1/(2)(2)= - 114.
This derivative is negative. The function llt is decreasing, and Af is below zero. The
graph is going downward in Figure 2.2, and its slope is negative:
An increasing f (t) has positive slope. A decreasing f (t) has negative slope.

The slope - l/t2 is very negative for small t. A price increase severely cuts demand.
The next figure makes a small but important point. There is nothing sacred about t.
Other letters can be used-especially x. A quantity can depend on position instead
of time. The height changes as we go west. The area of a square changes as the side
changes. Those are not affected by the passage of time, and there is no reason to use
t. You will often see y =f (x), with x across and y up-connected by a function f .
Similarly, f is not the only possibility. Not every function is named f! That letter
is useful because it stands for the word function-but we are perfectly entitled to
write y(x) or y(t) instead off (x) or f (t). The distance up is a function of the distance
across. This relationship "y of x" is all-important to mathematics.
The slope is also a function. Calculus is about two functions, y(x) and dyldx.
Question If we add 1 to y(x), what happens to the slope? Answer Nothing.
Question If we add 1 to the slope, what happens to the height? Answer

The symbols t and x represent independent variables-they take any value they
want to (in the domain). Once they are set, f (t) and y(x) are determined. Thus f and
y represent dependent variables-they depend on t and x. A change At produces a

change Af. A change Ax produces Ay. The independent variable goes inside the
parentheses in f ( t )and y(x). It is not the letter that matters, it is the idea:
independent variable t or x
dependent variable f or g or y or z or u
derivative dfldt or dfldx or dyldx or

--•

The derivative dyldx comes from [change in y] divided by [change in x ] . The time
step becomes a space step, forward or backward. The slope is the rate at which y
changes with x. The derivative of a function is its "rate of change."
I mention that physics books use x(t) for distance. Darn it.
To emphasize the definition of a derivative, here it is again with y and x:

Ay-Ax

y(x + Ax) - y(x) - distance up
Ax
distance across

dy =

dx

AY = yl(x).
lim Ax

AX+O

The notation yl(x)pins down the point x where the slope is computed. In dyldx that
extra precision is omitted. This book will try for a reasonable compromise between
logical perfection and ordinary simplicity. The notation dy/dx(x)is not good; yl(x)is
better; when x is understood it need not be written in parentheses.
You are allowed to say that the function is y = x2 and the derivative is y' = 2xeven if the strict notation requires y(x) = x2 and yl(x)= 2x. You can even say that
the function is x2 and its derivative is 2x and its second derivative is 2-provided
everybody knows what you mean.
Here is an example. It is a little early and optional but terrific. You get excellent
practice with letters and symbols, and out come new derivatives.
EXAMPLE 4

If u(x)has slope duldx, what is the slope off ( x )= ( ~ ( x ) ) ~ ?

From the derivative of x2 this will give the derivative of x4. In that case u = x2 and
f = x4. First point: The derivative of u2is not ( d ~ l d x We
) ~ . do not square the derivative
2x. To find the "square rule" we start as we have to-with Af =f ( x + Ax) -f (x):

+ AX))^ - ( u ( x ) =) ~[u(x+ A X )+ u(x)][ U ( X + A X )- ~ ( x ) ] .
This algebra puts Af in a convenient form. We factored a' - b2 into [a + b] times
Af

= (U(X

This is the square rule: The derivative of (u(x))' is 2u(x) times duldx. From the
derivatives of x2 and l / x and sin x (all known) the examples give new derivatives.
EXAMPLE 5 (u = x 2 ) The derivative of x4 is 2u duldx = 2(x2)(2x)= 4x3.
EXAMPLE 6 (u = l / x ) The derivative of 1/x2is 2u duldx = (2/x)(- 1 / x 2 )= - 2/x3.
EXAMPLE 7 (u = sin x, duldx = cos x ) The derivative of u2 = sin2x is 2 sin x cos x.

Mathematics is really about ideas. The notation is created to express those ideas.
Newton and Leibniz invented calculus independently, and Newton's friends spent a
lot of time proving that he was first. He was, but it was Leibniz who thought of

writing dyldx-which caught on. It is the perfect way to suggest the limit of AylAx.
Newton was one of the great scientists of all time, and calculus was one of the great
inventions of all time-but the notation must help. You now can write and speak
about the derivative. What is needed is a longer list of functions and derivatives.

2.2 Powers and Polynomials

-

This section has two main goals. One is to find the derivatives of f (x) = x3 and x4
and x5 (and more generally f (x) = xn). The power or exponent n is at first a positive
integer. Later we allow x" and x2s2 and every xn.
The other goal is different. While computing these derivatives, we look ahead to
their applications. In using calculus, we meet equations with derivatives in them"diflerentialequations." It is too early to solve those equations. But it is not too early
to see the purpose of what we are doing. Our examples come from economics and
biology.

With n = 2, the derivative of x2 is 2x. With n = - 1, the slope of x-' is - 1xp2.
Those are two pieces in a beautiful pattern, which it will be a pleasure to discover.
We begin with x3 and its derivative 3x2, before jumping to xn.
EXAMPLE 1 If f (x) = x3 then Af

= (x

+ h)3 - x3 = (x3 + 3x2h + 3xh2 + h3) - x3.

Step 2: Divide by h.

Step 1: Cancel x3.

approaches dx

That is straightforward, and you see the crucial step. The power (x + h)3 yields four
separate terms x3 3x2h 3xh2 h3. (Notice 1, 3, 3, 1.) After x3 is subtracted, we
can divide by h. At the limit (h = 0) we have 3x2.

+

+

For f(x) = xn the plan is the same. A step of size h leads to f(x + h) = (x + h)".
One reason for algebra is to calculate powers like (x + h)", and if you have forgotten
the binomial formula we can recapture its main point. Start with n = 4:

Multiplying the four x's gives x4. Multiplying the four h's gives h4. These are the easy
terms, but not the crucial ones. The subtraction (x + h)4 - x4 will remove x4, and the
limiting step h -,0 will wipe out h4 (even after division by h). The products that matter
are those with exactly one h. In Example 1 with (x + h)3, this key term was 3x2h.
Division by h left 3x2.
With only one h, there are n places it can come from. Equation (1) has four h's in
parentheses, and four ways to produce x3h. Therefore the key term is 4x3h. (Division
by h leaves 4x3.) In general there are n parentheses and n ways to produce xn- h, so
the binomial formula contains nxn- h:

'

Subtract xnfrom (2). Divide by h. The key term is nxn-'. The rest disappears as h + 0:

dx

The terms replaced by the dots involve h2 and h3 and higher powers. After dividing
by h, they still have at least one factor h. All those terms vanish as h approaches zero.
EXAMPLE 2 (x

+ h)4 = x4 + 4x3h + 6x2h2 + 4xh3 + h4.

This is n = 4 in detail.

Subtract x4, divide by h, let h + 0. The derivative is 4x3. The coefficients 1,4, 6, 4, 1
are in Pascal's triangle below. For (x + h)5 the next row is 1, 5, 10, 2.
Remark The missing terms in the binomial formula (replaced by the dots) contain
all the products xn-jhj. An x or an h comes from each parenthesis. The binomial
coefficient "n choose j" is the number of ways to choose j h's out of n parentheses. It
involves n factorial, which is n(n - 1) ... (1). Thus 5! = 5 4 3 2 1 = 120.

DERIVATIVES OF POLYNOMIALS

Now we have an infinite list of functions and their derivatives:
x x2 x3 x4 x5 ..-

The derivative of xn is n times the next lower power xn-l. That rule extends beyond
these integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to all powers:

That list is a good start, but plenty of functions are left. What comes next is really
simple. A tremendous number of new functions are "linear combinations" like
What are their derivatives? The answers are known for x3 and x2, and we want to
multiply by 6 or divide by 2 or add or subtract. Do the same to the derivatices:

2C

The derivative of c times f (x) is c times f '(x).

20

The derivative of f (x) + g(x) is f '(x) + gf(x).

The number c can be any constant. We can add (or subtract) any functions. The rules
allow any combination of f and g : The derivative of 9f (x) - 7g(x) is 9f '(x) - 7g1(x).

2.2

53

Powers and Polynomials

The reasoning is direct. When f (x) is multiplied by c, so is f (x + h). The difference
Af is also multiplied by c. All averages Af /h contain c, so their limit is cf '. The only
incomplete step is the last one (the limit). We still have to say what "limit" means.
Rule 2D is similar. Adding f + g means adding Af + Ag. Now divide by h. In the
limit as h + 0 we reach f ' + g'-because a limit of sums is a sum of limits. Any
example is easy and so is the proof-it is the definition of limit that needs care
(Section 2.6).
You can now find the derivative of every polynomial. A "polynomial" is a combination of 1, x, x2, ... , xn-for example 9 + 2x - x5. That particular polynomial has slope
2 - 5x4. Note that the derivative of 9 is zero! A constant just raises or lowers the
graph, without changing its slope. It alters the mileage before starting the car.
The disappearance of constants is one of the nice things in differential calculus.
The reappearance of those constants is one of the headaches in integral calculus.
When you find v from f , the starting mileage doesn't matter. The constant in f has
no effect on v. (Af is measured by a trip meter; At comes from a stopwatch.) To find
distance from velocity, you need to know the mileage at the start.
A LOOK AT DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS (FIND y FROM dyldx)

We know that y = x3 has the derivative dyldx = 3x2. Starting with the function, we
found its slope. Now reverse that process. Start with the slope andfind the function.
This is what science does all the time-and it seems only reasonable to say so.
Begin with dyldx = 3x2. The slope is given, the function y is not given.
Question Can you go backward to reach y = x3?
Answer Almost but not quite. You are only entitled to say that y = x3 + C. The
constant C is the starting value of y (when x = 0). Then the dzrerential equation
dyldx = 3x2 is solved.

Every time you find a derivative, you can go backward to solve a differential
equation. The function y = x2 + x has the slope dyldx = 2x + 1. In reverse, the slope
2x + 1 produces x2 + x-and all the other functions x2 + x + C, shifted up and down.
After going from distance f to velocity v, we return to f + C. But there is a lot more
to differential equations. Here are two crucial points:
1. We reach dyldx by way of AylAx, but we have no system to go backward. With
dyldx = (sin x)/x we are lost. What function has this derivative?
2. Many equations have the same solution y = x3. Economics has dyldx = 3ylx.
Geometry has dyldx = 3y213.These equations involve y as well as dyldx. Function and slope are mixed together! This is typical of differential equations.

To summarize: Chapters 2-4 compute and use derivatives. Chapter 5 goes in reverse.
Integral calculus discovers the function from its slope. Given dyldx we find y(x). Then
Chapter 6 solves the differential equation dyldt = y, function mixed with slope.
Calculus moves from derivatives to integrals to diferential equations.
This discussion of the purpose of calculus should mention a sp~cificexample.
Differential equations are applied to an epidemic (like AIDS). In most epi emics the
number of cases grows exponentially. The peak is quickly reached by e , and the
epidemic dies down. Amazingly, exponential growth is not happening witb AIDSthe best fit to the data through 1988 is a cubic polynomial (Los Alamos Sciehce, 1989):

4:

The number of cases fits a cubic within 2%: y = 174.6(t - 1981.2)3+ 340.

2 Derivatives

This is dramatically different from other epidemics. Instead of dyldt = y we have
dyldt = 3y/t. Before this book is printed, we may know what has been preventing d
(fortunately). Eventually the curve will turn away from a cubic-I hope that
mathematical models will lead to knowledge that saves lives.
Added in proofi In 1989 the curve for the U.S. dropped from t to t '.
MARGINAL COST AND ELASTICITY IN ECONOMICS

First point about economics: The marginal cost and marginal income are crucially
important. The average cost of making automobiles may be $10,000. But it is the
$8000 cost of the next car that decides whether Ford makes it. "The average describes
the past, the marginal predicts thefuture." For bank deposits or work hours or wheat,
which come in smaller units, the amounts are continuous variables. Then the word
"marginal" says one thing: Take the derivative.?
The average pay over all the hours we ever worked may be low. We wouldn't work
another hour for that! This average is rising, but the pay for each additional hour
rises faster-possibly it jumps. When $10/hour increases to $15/hour after a 40-hour
week, a 50-hour week pays $550. The average income is $ll/hour. The marginal
income is $15/hour-the overtime rate.
Concentrate next on cost. Let y(x) be the cost of producing x tons of steel. The
cost of x + Ax tons is y(x + Ax). The extra cost is the difference Ay. Divide by Ax,
the number of extra tons. The ratio Ay/Ax is the average cost per extra ton. When
Ax is an ounce instead of a ton, we are near the marginal cost dyldx.
Example: When the cost is x2, the average cost is x2/x = x. The marginal cost is
2x. Figure 2.4 has increasing slope-an example of "diminishing returns to scale."

Fig. 2.4 Marginal exceeds average. Constant elasticity E = +I. Perfectly elastic to perfectly
inelastic (rcurve).

This raises another point about economics. The units are arbitrary. In yen per
kilogram the numbers look different. The way to correct for arbitrary units is to work
with percentage change or relative change. An increase of Ax tons is a relative increase
of Axlx. A cost increase Ay is a relative increase of Ayly. Those are dimensionless, the
same in tons/tons or dollars/dollars or yen/yen.
A third example is the demand y at price x. Now dyldx is negative. But again the
units are arbitrary. The demand is in liters or gallons, the price is in dollars or pesos.
?These paragraphs show how calculus applies to economics. You do not have to be an
economist to understand them. Certainly the author is not, probably the instructor is not,
possibly the student is not. We can all use dyldx.

2.2 Powen and Polynomials

Relative changes are better. When the price goes up by lo%, the demand may drop
by 5%. If that ratio stays the same for small increases, the elasticity of demand is f.
Actually this number should be - f.The price rose, the demand dropped. In our
definition, the elasticity will be - 4.In conversation between economists the minus
sign is left out (I hope not forgotten).

DEFINITION The elasticity of the demand function y(x) is
E(x)

=

AY/Y lim - -.dyldx

AX-o Axlx

Y/X

Elasticity is "marginal" divided by "average." E(x) is also relative change in y divided
by relative change in x . Sometimes E(x) is the same at all prices-this important case
is discussed below.
EXAMPLE 1 Suppose the demand is y = c / x when the price is x. The derivative
dy/dx = - c/x2comes from calculus. The division y/x = c / x 2is only algebra. The ratio
is E = - 1 :
For the demand y = c / x , the elasticity is (- c / x 2 ) / ( c / x 2=) - 1 .

All demand curves are compared with this one. The demand is inelastic when 1El < 1 .
It is elastic when IEl > 1. The demand 20/& is inelastic ( E = - f), while x - i~s
elastic (E = - 3). The power y = cxn, whose derivative we know, is the function with
constant elasticity n:
if y = cxn then dyldx = cnxn- ' and E = cnxn- l/(cxn/x)= n.
It is because y = cxn sets the standard that we could come so early to economics.
In the special case when y = clx, consumers spend the same at all prices. Price x
times quantity y remains constant at xy = c .
EXAMPLE 2 The supply curve has E > 0-supply increases with price. Now the
baseline case is y = cx. The slope is c and the average is y / x = c. The elasticity is
E = c / c = 1.

Compare E = 1 with E = 0 and E = CQ. A constant supply is "perfectly inelastic."
The power n is zero and the slope is zero: y = c . No more is available when the
harvest is over. Whatever the price, the farmer cannot suddenly grow more wheat.
Lack of elasticity makes farm economics difficult.
The other extreme E = a~is "perfectly elastic." The supply is unlimited at a fixed
price x. Once this seemed true of water and timber. In reality the steep curve
x = constant is leveling off to a flat curve y = constant. Fixed price is changing to
fixed supply, E = CQ is becoming E = 0, and the supply of water follows a "gamma
curve" shaped like T.
EXAMPLE 3 Demand is an increasing function of income-more income, more

demand. The income elasticity is E(I) = ( d y / d I ) / ( y / I ) A
Doubling your income more than doubles the demand for caviar. A necessity has
E < 1 (inelastic). The demand for bread does not double. Please recognize how the
central ideas of calculus provide a language for the central ideas of economics.

Important note on supply = demand This is the basic equation of microeconomics.
Where the supply curve meets the demand curve, the economy finds the equilibrium
price. Supply = demand assumes perfect competition. With many suppliers, no one can
raise the price. If someone tries, the customers go elsewhere.

2

Derivatives

The opposite case is a monopoly-no competition. Instead of many small producers
of wheat, there is one producer of electricity. An airport is a monopolist (and maybe
the National Football League). If the price is raised, some demand remains.
Price fixing occurs when several producers act like a monopoly-which antitrust
laws try to prevent. The price is not set by supply = demand. The calculus problem
is different-to maximize profit. Section 3.2 locates the maximum where the marginal
profit (the slope!) is zero.
Question on income elasticity From an income of $10,000 you save $500. The
income elasticity of savings is E = 2. Out of the next dollar what fraction do you
save?
Answer
The savings is y = cx2 because E = 2. The number c must give 500 =
~(10,000)~,
so c is 5
Then the slope dyldx is 2cx = 10
lo4 = &. This is
the marginal savings, ten cents on the dollar. Average savings is 5%, marginal savings
is lo%, and E = 2.

2.3 The Slope and the Tangent Line

-

Chapter 1 started with straight line graphs. The velocity was constant (at least piecewise). The distance function was linear. Now we are facing polynomials like x3 - 2
or x4 - x2 + 3, with other functions to come soon. Their graphs are definitely curved.
Most functions are not close to linear-except if you focus all your attention near a
single point. That is what we will do.
Over a very short range a curve looks straight. Look through a microscope, or zoom
in with a computer, and there is no doubt. The graph of distance versus time becomes
nearly linear. Its slope is the velocity at that moment. We want to find the line that
the graph stays closest to-the "tangent linew-before it curves away.
The tangent line is easy to describe. We are at a particular point on the graph of
y =f (x). At that point x equals a and y equals f (a) and the slope equals f '(a).
The tangent line goes through that point x = a, y =f (a) with that slope m = fl(a).
Figure 2.5 shows the line more clearly than any equation, but we have to turn the
geometry into algebra. We need the equation of the line.

EXAMPLE 1 Suppose y = x4 - x2 + 3. At the point x = a = 1, the height is y =f (a) = 3.
The slope is dyldx = 4x3 - 2x. At x = 1 the slope is 4 - 2 = 2. That is fl(a):

The numbers x = 1, y = 3, dyldx = 2 determine the tangent line.
The equation of the tangent line is y - 3 = 2(x - l), and this section explains why.

Fig. 2.5

The tangent line has the same slope 2 as the curve (especially after zoom).

THE EQUATION OF A LINE

A straight line is determined by two conditions. We know the line if we know two
of its points. (We still have to write down the equation.) Also, if we know one point
and the slope, the line is set. That is the situation for the tangent line, which has a
known slope at a known point:
1. The equation of a line has the form y = mx + b
2. The number m is the slope of the line, because dyldx = m
3. The number b adjusts the line to go through the required point.
I will take those one at a time-first

y = mx + b, then m, then b.

1. The graph of y = mx + b is not curved. How do we know? For the specific example
y = 2x 1, take two points whose coordinates x, y satisfy the equation:

+

x=O, y = 1 and x = 4 , y = 9 both satisfy y = 2 x + 1.

2.3 The Slope and the Tangent Line

Those points (0, 1) and (4,9) lie on the graph. The point halfway between has x = 2
and y = 5. That point also satisfies y = 2x + 1. The halfway point is on the graph. If
we subdivide again, the midpoint between (0, 1) and (2, 5) is (1, 3). This also has
y = 2x + 1. The graph contains all halfway points and must be straight.

2. What is the correct slope m for the tangent line? In our example it is m =f '(a)= 2.
The curve and its tangent line have the same slope at the crucial point: dyldx = 2.
Allow me to say in another way why the line y = mx + b has slope m. At x = 0 its
height is y = b. At x = 1 its height is y = m + b. The graph has gone one unit across
(0 to 1) and m units up (b to m + b). The whole idea is
slope =

m
distance up -distance across 1

'

Each unit across means m units up, to 2m + b or 3m + b. A straight line keeps a
constant slope, whereas the slope of y = x4 - x2 + 3 equals 2 only at x = 1.

3. Finally we decide on b. The tangent line y = 2x + b must go through x = 1 , y = 3.
Therefore b = 1. With letters instead of numbers, y = mx + b leads to f (a)= ma + b.
So we know b:

I

2E The equation of the tangent line has b =f (a)- ma:

y=mx+f(a)-ma

or

y-f(a)=m(x-a).

(2)

That last form is the best. You see immediately what happens at x = a. The factor
x - a is zero. Therefore y =f (a)as required. This is the point-slope form of the equation, and we use it constantly:
y - 3 - distance up = sbpe 2.
y-3=2(x-1)
or
-x - 1 distance across
EXAMPLE 2 The curve y = x3 - 2 goes through y = 6 when x = 2. At that point
dyldx = 3x2 = 12. The point-slope equation of the tangent line uses 2 and 6 and 12:

y - 6 = 12(x-2),

which is also y = 12x- 18.

There is another important line. It is perpendicular to the tangent line and perpendicular to the curve. This is the normal line in Figure 2.6. Its new feature is its slope.
When the tangent line has slope m, the normal line has slope - llm. (Rule: Slopes of

The same problem is solved by spacecraft controllers and baseball pitchers. Releasing
a ball at the right time to hit a target 60 feet away is an amazing display of calculus.
Quarterbacks with a moving target should read Chapter 4 on related rates.
Here is a better example than a roller-coaster. Stopping at a red light wastes gas.
It is smarter to slow down early, and then accelerate. When a car is waiting in front
of you, the timing needs calculus:
How much must you slow down when a red light is 72 meters away?
In 4 seconds it will be green. The waiting car will accelerate at 3 meters/sec2. You
cannot pass the car.

EXAMPLE 4

Strategy Slow down immediately to the speed V at which you will just catch that

car. (If you wait and brake later, your speed will have to go below V.) At the catchup time T , the cars have the same speed and same distance. Two conditions, so the
distance functions in Figure 2.6d are tangent.
Solution At time T, the other car's speed is 3 ( T - 4). That shows the delay of 4
seconds. Speeds are equal when 3 ( T - 4 ) = V or T = V 4. Now require equal dis-

+

tances. Your distance is V times T . The other car's distance is 72 + $at2:
7 2 + 5 3 ( ~ - 4 ) ~ = V Tbecomes

72+f-f-v2=V(3V+4).

The solution is V = 12 meters/second. This is 43 km/hr or 27 miles per hour.
Without the other car, you only slow down to V = 7214 = 18 meters/second. As
the light turns green, you go through at 65 km/hr or 40 miles per hour. Try it.
THE SECANT LINE CONNECTING TWO POINTS O N A CURVE

Instead of the tangent line through one point, consider the secant line through two
points. For the tangent line the points came together. Now spread them apart. The
point-slope form of a linear equation is replaced by the two-point form.
The equation of the curve is still y =f (x). The first point remains at x = a, y =f (a).
The other point is at x = c, y =f (c). The secant line goes between them. and we want
its equation. This time we don't start with the slope-but rn is easy to find.

The Slope and the Tangent Line

2.3

EXAMPLE 5 The curve y = x3 - 2 goes through x = 2, y = 6. It also goes through
x = 3, y = 25. The slope between those points is

m=

change in y --- 25 - 6 - 19.
change in x 3 - 2

The point-slope form (at the first point) is y - 6 = 19(x - 2). This line automatically
goes through the second point (3,25). Check: 25 - 6 equals 19(3- 2). The secant
has the right slope 19 to reach the second point. It is the average slope AylAx.
A look ahead The second point is going to approach the first point. The secant
slope AylAx will approach the tangent slope dyldx. We discover the derivative (in
the limit). That is the main point now-but not forever.
Soon you will be fast at derivatives. The exact dyldx will be much easier than
AylAx. The situation is turned around as soon as you know that x9 has slope
9x8. Near x = 1, the distance up is about 9 times the distance across. To find
Ay = l.0019 - 19,just multiply Ax = .001 by 9. The quick approximation is .009, the
calculator gives Ay = .009036. It is easier to follow the tangent line than the curve.

Come back to the secant line, and change numbers to letters. What line connects
x = a, y =f (a) to x = c, y =f (c)? A mathematician puts formulas ahead of numbers,
and reasoning ahead of formulas, and ideas ahead of reasoning:
distance up - f (c) -f (a)
distance across
c-a
(2) The height is y =f (a) at x = a
(3) The height is y =f (c) at x = c (automatic with correct slope).

At x = a the right side is zero. So y =f (a) on the left side. At x = c the right side has
two factors c - a. They cancel to leave y =f (c). With equation (2) for the tangent line
and equation (3) for the secant line, we are ready for the moment of truth.
THE SECANT LlNE APPROACHES THE TANGENT LlNE

What comes now is pretty basic. It matches what we did with velocities:
average velocity =

The limit is df /dt. We now do exactly the same thing with slopes. The secant tine

There stands the fundamental idea of differential calculus! You have to imagine more

c - a as Ax. Do you recognize f (c) -f (a) as f (x + Ax) -f (x)? It is Af, the change
in height. All lines go through x = a, y =f (a). Their limit is the tangent line.

Intuitively, the limit is pretty clear. The two points come together, and the tangent
line touches the curve at one point. (It could touch again at faraway points.) Mathematically this limit can be tricky-it takes us from algebra to calculus. Algebra stays
away from 010, but calculus gets as close as it can.
The new limit for df /dx looks different, but it is the same as before:

EXAMPLE 6 Find the secant lines and tangent line for y =f (x) = sin x at x = 0.

As c approaches zero, the secant line becomes the tangent line. The limit of (sin c)/c

This section does two things. One is to compute the derivatives of sin x and cos x.
The other is to explain why these functions are so important. They describe oscillation,
which will be expressed in words and equations. You will see a "di~erentialequation."
It involves the derivative of an unknown function y(x).
The differential equation will say that the second derivative-the derivative of the
derivative-is equal and opposite to y. In symbols this is y" = - y. Distance in one
direction leads to acceleration in the other direction. That makes y and y' and y" all
oscillate. The solutions to y" = - y are sin x and cos x and all their combinations.
We begin with the slope. The derivative of y = sin x is y' = cos x. There is no reason
for that to be a mystery, but I still find it beautiful. Chapter 1 followed a ball around
a circle; the shadow went up and down. Its height was sin t and its velocity was cos t .

We now find that derivative by the standard method of limits, when y(x) = sin x:

The sine is harder to work with than x2 or x3. Where we had (x + h)2 or (x + h)3, we
now have sin(x h). This calls for one of the basic "addition formulas" from trigonometry, reviewed in Section 1.5:

+

sin (x + h) = sin x cos h + cos x sin h

(2)

+ h) = cos x cos h - sin x sin h.

The ratio splits into two simpler pieces on the right. Algebra and trigonometry got
us this far, and now comes the calculus problem. What happens as h + O? It is no
longer easy to divide by h. (I will not even mention the unspeakable crime of writing
(sin h)/h = sin.) There are two critically important limits-the first is zero and the
second is one:
sin h
cos h - 1

and
lim -- 1.

The careful reader will object that limits have not been defined! You may further
object to computing these limits separately, before combining them into equation (4).
Nevertheless-following the principle of ideas now, rigor later-I would like to proceed. It is entirely true that the limit of (4) comes from the two limits in (5):
dy-- (sin

+

x)(first limit) (cos x)(second limit) = 0 + cos x.

(6)

The secant slope Ay/Ax has approached the tangent slope dyldx.

We cannot pass over the crucial step-the two limits in (5). They contain the real
ideas. Both ratios become 010 i f we just substitute h = 0. Remember that the cosine of
a zero angle is 1, and the sine of a zero angle is 0. Figure 2.8a shows a small angle h
(as near to zero as we could reasonably draw). The edge of length sin h is close to
zero, and the edge of length cos h is near 1. Figure 2.8b shows how the ratio of sin h
to h (both headed for zero) gives the slope of the sine curve at the start.
When two functions approach zero, their ratio might do anything. We might have

No clue comes from 010. What matters is whether the top or bottom goes to zero
more quickly. Roughly speaking, we want to show that (cos h - l)/h is like h2/h and
(sin h)/h is like hlh.
Time out The graph of sin x is in Figure 2.9 (in black). The graph of sin(x + Ax)
sits just beside it (in red). The height difference is Af when the shift distance is Ax.

sin ( x h) with h = 10" = 11/18 radians. Af/Ax is close to cos x.

Now divide by that small number Ax (or h). The second figure shows Af /Ax. It is
close to cos x. (Look how it starts-it is not quite cos x.) Mathematics will prove
that the limit is cos x exactly, when Ax -,0. Curiously, the reasoning concentrates
on only one point (x = 0). The slope at that point is cos 0 = 1.
We now prove this: sin Ax divided by Ax goes to 1. The sine curve starts with
slope 1. By the addition formula for sin (x + h), this answer at one point will lead to
the slope cos x at all points.

+

Question Why does the graph of f (x Ax) shift left from f (x) when Ax > O?
Answer When x = 0, the shifted graph is already showing f (Ax). In Figure 2.9a, the
red graph is shifted left from the black graph. The red graph shows sin h when the
black graph shows sin 0.
THE LIMIT OF (sin h ) / h IS 4

There are several ways to find this limit. The direct approach is to let a computer
draw a graph. Figure 2.10a is very convincing. Thefunction (sin h)/h approaches 1 at
the key point h = 0. So does (tan h)/h. In practice, the only danger is that you might
get a message like "undefined function" and no graph. (The machine may refuse to
divide by zero at h = 0. Probably you can get around that.) Because of the importance
of this limit, I want to give a mathematical proof that it equals 1.

Fig. 2.40 (sin h)/h squeezed between cos x and 1; (tan h)/h decreases to 1.

Figure 2.10b indicates, but still only graphically, that sin h stays below h. (The first
graph shows that too; (sin h)/h is below 1.) We also see that tan h stays above h.
Remember that the tangent is the ratio of sine to cosine. Dividing by the cosine is
enough to push the tangent above h. The crucial inequalities (to be proved when h
is small and positive) are
sinh<h

and

tanh>h.

(7)

2.4

The Derlvcrthre of the Sine and Cosine

Since tan h = (sin h)/(cos h), those are the same as
sin h
<1
h

and

sin h
-> cos h.
h

What happens as h goes to zero? The ratio (sin h)/h is squeezed between cos h and 1.
But cos h is approaching I! The squeeze as h + 0 leaves only one possibility for
(sin h)/h, which is caught in between: The ratio (sin h)/h approaches 1.
Figure 2.10 shows that "squeeze play." lf two functions approach the same limit, so
does any function caught in between. This is proved at the end of Section 2.6.
For negative values of h, which are absolutely allowed, the result is the same. To
the left of zero, h reverses sign and sin h reverses sign. The ratio (sin h)/h is unchanged.
(The sine is an odd function: sin (- h) = - sin h.) The ratio is an even function, symmetric around zero and approaching 1 from both sides.
The proof depends on sin h < h < tan h, which is displayed by the graph but not
explained. We go back to right triangles.

Fig. 2.1 1 Line shorter than arc: 2 sin h < 2h. Areas give h < tan h.

Figure 2.11a shows why sin h < h. The straight line PQ has length 2 sin h. The
circular arc must be longer, because the shortest distance between two points is a
straight line.? The arc PQ has length 2h. (Important: When the radius is 1, the arc
length equals the angle. The full circumference is 2n and the full angle is also 2n.)
The straight distance 2 sin h is less than the circular distance 2h, so sin h < h.
Figure 2.1 1b shows why h < tan h. This time we look at areas. The triangular area
is f (base)(height)= i(l)(tan h). Inside that triangle is the shaded sector of the circle.
Its area is h/2n times the area of the whole circle (because the angle is that fraction
of the whole angle). The circle has area nr2 = n, so multiplication by h/2n gives f h
for the area of the sector. Comparing with the triangle around it, f tan h > f h.
The inequalities sin h < h < tan h are now proved. The squeeze in equation (8)
produces (sin h)/h -, 1. Q.E.D. Problem 13 shows how to prove sin h < h from areas.

Note All angles x and h are being measured in radians. In degrees, cos x is not the
derivative of sin x. A degree is much less than a radian, and dyldx is reduced by the
factor 2~1360.
THE LIMIT OF (COS h - 1 ) / h IS 0

This second limit is different. We will show that 1 - cos h shrinks to zero more quickly
than h. Cosines are connected to sines by (sin h)2 + (cos h)2 = 1. We start from the

known fact sin h < h and work it into a form involving cosines:
(1 - cos h)(l + cos h) = 1 - (cos h)2 = (sin h)2 < h2.

Note that everything is positive. Divide through by h and also by 1 + cos h:

Our ratio is caught in the middle. The right side goes to zero because h + 0. This is
another "squeezew-there is no escape. Our ratio goes to zero.
For cos h - 1 or for negative h, the signs change but minus zero is still zero. This
confirms equation (6). The slope of sin x is cos x.
Remark Equation (10) also shows that 1 - cos h is approximately i h 2 . The 2 comes
from 1 + cos h. This is a basic purpose of calculus-to find simple approximations
like $h2. A "tangent parabola" 1 - $h2 is close to the top of the cosine curve.
THE DERIVATIVE OF THE COSINE

This will be easy. The quick way to differentiate cos x is to shift the sine curve by
xl2.That yields the cosine curve (solid line in Figure 2.12b).The derivative also shifts
by 4 2 (dotted line). The derivative of cos x is - sin x.
Notice how the dotted line (the slope) goes below zero when the solid line turns
downward. The slope equals zero when the solid line is level. Increasing functions
have positive slopes. Decreasing functions have negative slopes. That is important, and
we return to it.
There is more information in dyldx than "function rising" or "function falling."
The slope tells how quickly the function goes up or down. It gives the rate of change.
The slope of y = cos x can be computed in the normal way, as the limit of AylAx:

reaching 0 and 1 as before. This confirms the graphical proof that the slope of cos x
is - sin x.

THE SECOND DERIVATIVES OF THE SINE AND COSINE

We now introduce the derivative of the derivative. That is the second derivative of the
original function. It tells how fast the slope is changing, not how fast y itself is

2.4 The Derivative of the Sine and Cosine

changing. The second derivative is the "rate of change of the velocity." A straight line
has constant slope (constant velocity), so its second derivative is zero:

f (t) = 5t has df /dt = 5 and d2f /dt2 = 0.
The parabola y = x2 has slope 2x (linear) which has slope 2 (constant). Similarly
f ( t ) = r a t 2 has df/dt=at

and d2f/dt2=a.

There stands the notation d2f/dt2 (or d2y/dx2)for the second derivative. A short
form is f " or y". (This is pronounced f double prime or y double prime). Example:
The second derivative of y = x3 is y" = 6x.
In the distance-velocity problem, f " is acceleration. It tells how fast v is changing,
while v tells how fast f is changing. Where df/dt was distanceltime, the second
derivative is di~tance/(time)~.
The acceleration due to gravity is about 32 ft/sec2 or
9.8 m/sec2, which means that v increases by 32 ftlsec in one second. It does not mean
that the distance increases by 32 feet!
The graph of y = sin t increases at the start. Its derivative cos t is positive. However
the second derivative is -sin t. The curve is bending down while going up. The arch
is "concave down" because y" = - sin t is negative.
At t = n the curve reaches zero and goes negative. The second derivative becomes
positive. Now the curve bends upward. The lower arch is "concave up."
y" > 0 means that y' increases so y bends upward (concave up)
y" < 0 means that y' decreases so y bends down (concave down).
Chapter 3 studies these things properly-here we get an advance look for sin t.
The remarkable fact about the sine and cosine is that y" = - y. That is unusual
and special: acceleration = -distance. The greater the distance, the greater the force
pulling back:
y = sin t

has dy/dt =

+ cos t

y = cos t has dy/dt = - sin t

and d2y/dt2= - sin t

= - y.

and d y/dt2 = - cos t = - y.

Question Does d2y/dt2< 0 mean that the distance y(t) is decreasing?
Answer No. Absolutely not! It means that dy/dt is decreasing, not necessarily y.
At the start of the sine curve, y is still increasing but y" < 0.
Sines and cosines give simple harmonic motion-up and down, forward and back,
out and in, tension and compression. Stretch a spring, and the restoring force pulls
it back. Push a swing up, and gravity brings it down. These motions are controlled
by a diyerential equation:

+

All solutions are combinations of the sine and cosine: y = A sin t B cos t.
This is not a course on differential equations. But you have to see the purpose of
calculus. It models events by equations. It models oscillation by equation (12). Your
heart fills and empties. Balls bounce. Current alternates. The economy goes up and
down:
high prices -+ high production -,low prices -, -..
We can't live without oscillations (or differential equations).

33 Explain the second derivative in your own words.

What are the derivatives of x + sin x and x sin x and l/sin x and xlsin x and sinnx?
Those are made up from the familiar pieces x and sin x, but we need new rules.
Fortunately they are rules that apply to every function, so they can be established
once and for all. If we know the separate derivatives of two functions u and v, then
the derivatives of u + v and uu and llv and u/u and un are immediately available.
This is a straightforward section, with those five rules to learn. It is also an important section, containing most of the working tools of differential calculus. But I am
afraid that five rules and thirteen examples (which we need-the eyes glaze over with
formulas alone) make a long list. At least the easiest rule comes first. When we add
functions, we add their derivatives.
Sum Rule
d
du dv
The derivative of the sum u(x) + v(x) is -(u + v) = - + -.
dx
dx dx
EXAMPLE 1 The derivative of x + sin x is 1 + cos x. That is tremendously simple,
but it is fundamental. The interpretation for distances may be more confusing (and
more interesting) than the rule itself:

Suppose a train moves with velocity 1. The distance at time t is t. On the train
a professor paces back and forth (in simple harmonic motion). His distance from
his seat is sin t. Then the total distance from his starting point is t + sin t, and
his velocity (train speed plus walking speed) is 1 + cos t.
If you add distances, you add velocities. Actually that example is ridiculous, because
the professor's maximum speed equals the train speed (= 1). He is running like mad,
not pacing. Occasionally he is standing still with respect to the ground.
The sum rule is a special case of a bigger rule called "linearity." It applies when
we add or subtract functions and multiply them by constants-as in 3x - 4 sin x. By
linearity the derivative is 3 - 4 cos x. The rule works for all functions u(x) and v(x).
A linear combination is y(x) = au(x) + bv(x), where a and b are any real numbers.
Then AylAx is

The limit on the left is dyldx. The limit on the right is a duJdx + b dvldx. We are
allowed to take limits separately and add. The result is what we hope for:

The derivative of au(x) + bv(x) is - (au + bu) = a - + b -.

The prorluct rule comes next. It can't be so simple-products are not linear. The
sum rule is what you would have done anyway, but products give something new.
The krivative of u times v is not duldx times dvldx. Example: The derivative of x5
is 5x4. Don't multiply the derivatives of x3 and x2. (3x2 times 2x is not 5x4.)
For a product of two functions, the derivative has two terms.

This confirms the "square rule" 2u duldx, when u is the same as v. Similarly the slope
of cos2x is -2 cos x sin x (minus sign from the slope of the cosine).
Question Those answers for sin2x and cos2x have opposite signs, so the derivative
of sin2x + cos2x is zero (sum rule). How do you see that more quickly?

2.5 The Product and Quotient and Power Rules

After those examples we prove the product rule. Figure 2.13 explains it best. The
area of the big rectangle is uv. The important changes in area are the two strips u Av
and v Au. The corner area Au Av is much smaller. When we divide by Ax, the strips
give u Av/Ax and v AulAx. The corner gives Au AvlAx, which approaches zero.
Notice how the sum rule is in one dimension and the product rule is in two
dimensions. The rule for uvw would be in three dimensions.
The extra area comes from the whole top strip plus the side strip. By algebra,
This increase is u(x + h)Av + v(x)Au-top plus side. Now divide by h (or Ax) and let
h + 0. The left side of equation (4) becomes the derivative of u(x)v(x). The right side
becomes u(x) times dvldx-we can multiply the two limits-plus v(x) times duldx.
That proves the product rule-definitely useful.
We could go immediately to the quotient rule for u(x)/v(x). But start with u = 1.

It is worth checking the units-in the reciprocal rule and others. A test of dimensions is automatic in science and engineering, and a good idea in mathematics. The
test ignores constants and plus or minus signs, but it prevents bad errors. If v is in
dollars and x is in hours, dv/dx is in dollars per hour. Then dimensions agree:

From this test, the derivative of l/v cannot be l/(dv/dx). A similar test shows that

Those formulas are often seen in calculus. If you have a good memory they are worth

them (maybe once a year). It is really the rules that are basic, not the formulas.

Again to memorize: (tan x)' = sec2x. At x = 0, this slope is 1. The graphs of sin x
and x and tan x all start with this slope (then they separate). At x = n/2 the sine
curve is flat (cos x = 0) and the tangent curve is vertical (sec2x = co).
The slope generally blows up faster than the function. We divide by cos x, once
for the tangent and twice for its slope. The slope of l/x is -l/x2. The slope is more
sensitive than the function, because of the square in the denominator.

That one I hesitate to touch at x = 0. Formally it becomes 010. In reality it is more
like 03/02,and the true derivative is zero. Figure 2.10 showed graphically that (sin x)/x
is flat at the center point. The function is even (symmetric across the y axis) so its
derivative can only be zero.
This section is full of rules, and I hope you will allow one more. It goes beyond xn
to (u(x)r. A power of x changes to a power of u(x)-as in (sin x ) ~or (tan x)' or
(x2 + I)*. The derivative contains nun-' (copying nxn- '), but there is an extra factor
duldx. Watch that factor in 6(sin x)' cos x and 7(tan x ) sec2
~ x and 8(x2+ l)'(2x):
Power Rule
du

;
The derivative of [u(x)In is n[~(x)]~-' ;
For n = 1 this reduces to du/dx = duldx. For n = 2 we get the square rule 2u duldx.
Next comes u3. The best approach is to use mathematical induction, which goes from
each n to the next power n + 1 by the product rule:

That is exactly equation (12) for the power n + 1. We get all positive powers this way,
going up from n = 1-then the negative powers come from the reciprocal rule.
Figure 2.15 shows the power rule for n = 1,2,3. The cube makes the point
best. The three thin slabs are u by u by Au. The change in volume is essentially
3u2Au. From multiplying out ( ~ + A u ) ~the
, exact change in volume is
3u2Au + ~ u ( A u+) ~(A~)~-whichalso accounts for three narrow boxes and a midget
cube in the corner. This is the binomial formula in a picture.

You have seen enough limits to be ready for a definition. It is true that we have
survived this far without one, and we could continue. But this seems a reasonable
time to define limits more carefully. The goal is to achieve rigor without rigor mortis.
First you should know that limits of Ay/Ax are by no means the only limits in
mathematics. Here are five completely different examples. They involve n + a,not
Ax + 0:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

a, = (n - 3)/(n + 3) (for large n, ignore the 3's and find a, + 1)
a, = )a,-, + 4 (start with any a, and always a, + 8)
an = probability of living to year n (unfortunately an + 0)
a, = fraction of zeros among the first n digits of n (an+ h?)
a, = .4, a2 = .49, a, = .493, .... No matter what the remaining decimals are, the
a's converge to a limit. Possibly a, + .493000 ..., but not likely.

The problem is to say what the limit symbol + really means.
A good starting point is to ask about convergence to zero. When does a sequence
of positive numbers approach zero? What does it mean to write an+ O? The numbers
a,, a,, a,, ..., must become "small," but that is too vague. We will propose four
definitions of convergence to zero, and I hope the right one will be clear.

1. All the numbers a, are below 10- lo. That may be enough for practical purposes,
but it certainly doesn't make the a, approach zero.
2. The sequence is getting closer to zero-each a,, is smaller than the preceding
a,. This test is met by 1.1, 1.01, 1.001, ... which converges to 1 instead of 0.
3. For any small number you think of, at least one of the an's is smaller. That pushes
something toward zero, but not necessarily the whole sequence. The condition would
be satisfied by 1, ), 1, f, 1, i,
...,which does not approach zero.
4. For any small number you think of, the an's eventually go below that number and
stay below. This is the correct definition.

I want to repeat that. To test for convergence to zero, start with a small numbersay 10-lo. The an's must go below that number. They may come back up and go
below again-the first million terms make absolutely no difference. Neither do the
next billion, but eventually all terms must go below lo-''. After waiting longer
(possibly a lot longer), all terms drop below
The tail end of the sequence
decides everything.
Question 1 Doesthesequence lo-,,
10-~,10-~,
... approacho?
Answer Yes. These up and down numbers eventually stay below any E .

a,<~ifn>3

Fig. 2.17

non-convergence

Convergence means: Only a finite number of a's are outside any strip around L.

2.6 Limits

Question 2 Does lo-',
lo-*, lo-',, 10-lo, ... approach zero?
but does not stay below.
Answer No. This sequence goes below
There is a recognized symbol for "an arbitrarily small positive number." By
worldwide agreement, it is the Greek letter E (epsilon). Convergence to zero means
that the sequence eventually goes below E and stays there. The smaller the E,the tougher
the test and the longer we wait. Think of E as the tolerance, and keep reducing it.
To emphasize that E comes from outside, Socrates can choose it. Whatever E he
proposes, the a's must eventually be smaller. After some a,, all the a's are below the
tolerance E. Here is the exact statement:
for any E there is an N such that a, < E if n > N.
Once you see that idea, the rest is easy. Figure 2.17 has N = 3 and then N = 6.

f ,$, 8, ... starts upward but goes to zero. Notice that
1,4,9, ..., 100, ... are squares, and 2,4, 8, ..., 1024, ... are powers of 2. Eventually 2"
grows faster than n2, as in alo = 100/1024. The ratio goes below any E.
EXAMPLE I The sequence

EXAMPLE 2 1, 0, f ,0, f ,0, ... approaches zero. These a's do not decrease steadily
(the mathematical word for steadily is monotonica ally") but still their limit is zero.
The choice E = 1 / 1 0 produces the right response: Beyond azoolall terms are below
1/1000. So N = 2001 for that E.

The sequence 1, f ,f ,4,f ,f ,... is much slower-but it also converges to zero.
Next we allow the numbers a, to be negative as well as positive. They can converge
upward toward zero, or they can come in from both sides. The test still requires the
a, to go inside any strip near zero (and stay there). But now the strip starts at - E.
The distancefrom zero is the absolute value la,l. Therefore a, -,0 means lanl+ 0.
The previous test can be applied to lanl:
for any E there is an N such that la,l < E if n > N.
EXAMPLE 3 1, - f ,f , -

4,...convergesto zero because 1,f ,f ,$, ...convergesto zero.

It is a short step to limits other than zero. The limit is L if the numbers a, - L
converge to Zero. Our final test applies to the absolute value la, - LI:
for any E there is an N such that (a, - L( < E if n > N.
This is the definition of convergence! Only a finite number of a's are outside any strip
around L (Figure 2.18). We write a, -,L or lim -a, = L or limn,, a, = L.

Fig. 2.18 a, -,0 in Example 3; a, -* 1 in Example 4;a, -, rn in Example 5 (but a,,, - a,

-,0).

EXAMPLE 4 The numbers 3, 2, g, ... converge to L = 1. After subtracting 1 the
differences 3, f , k, ... converge to zero. Those difference are la, - LI.

The distance between terms is getting smaller. But those numbers a,, a,, a3,a,, ... go
past any proposed limit L. The second term is 15. The fourth term adds on 3 +
so a, goes past 2. The eighth term has four new fractions 4 + &+f $, totaling
more than $ + $ + $ + & = 3. Therefore a, exceeds 23. Eight more terms will add more
than 8 times &, so a,, is beyond 3. The lines in Figure 2 . 1 8 ~are infinitely long, not
stopping at any L.
In the language of Chapter 10, the harmonic series 1 + 3 + 3 + does not converge.
The sum is infinite, because the "partial sums" a, go beyond every limit L (a,,,, is
past L = 9). We will come back to infinite series, but this example makes a subtle
point: The steps between the a, can go to zero while still a, -, a.

+

4,

Thus the condition a,+, - a, -,0 is not suficient for convergence. However this
condition is necessary. If we do have convergence, then a,,, - a, -,0. That is a good
exercise in the logic of convergence, emphasizing the difference between "sufficient"
and "necessary." We discuss this logic below, after proving that [statement A] implies
[statement B]:

If [a, converges to L] then [a,+ ,- a, converges to zero].

(1)

Proof Because the a, converge, there is a number N beyond which (a, - L( < s and
also la, + - LI < E. Since a, +, - a, is the sum of a, +, - L and L - a,, its absolute
value cannot exceed E + E = 2s. Therefore a,+ - a, approaches zero.
Objection by Socrates: We only got below 2s and he asked for s. Our reply: If he
particularly wants la, + - a, 1 < 1/10, we start with s = 1/20. Then 2s = 1/10. But this
juggling is not necessary. To stay below 2s is just as convincing as to stay below s.

THE LOGIC OF "IF" AND "ONLY IF"

The following page is inserted to help with the language of mathematics. In ordinary
language we might say "I will come if you call." Or we might say "I will come only
if you call." That is different! A mathematician might even say "I will come if and
only if you call." Our goal is to think through the logic, because it is important and
not so fami1iar.t
Statement A above implies statement B. Statement A is a, -,L; statement B is
a,+, - a, -,0. Mathematics has at least five ways of writing down A => B, and I
though you might like to see them together. It seems excessive to have so many
expressions for the same idea, but authors get desperate for a little variety. Here are
the five ways that come to mind:
A implies B
if A then B
A is a suflcient condition for B

B is true if A is true
?Logical thinking is much more important than E and 6.

EXAMPLES If [positive numbers are decreasing] then [they converge to a limit].
If [sequences a, and b, converge] then [the sequence a, b, converges].
If [f (x) is the integral of v(x)] then [v(x) is the derivative of f (x)].

+

Those are all true, but not proved. A is the hypothesis, B is the conclusion.
Now we go in the other direction. (It is called the "converse," not the inverse.) We
exchange A and B. Of course stating the converse does not make it true! B might
imply A, or it might not. In the first two examples the converse was false-the a,
can converge without decreasing, and a, + b, can converge when the separate
sequences do not. The converse of the third statement is true-and there are five
more ways to state it:
A* B
A is implied by B

i f B then A
A is a necessary condition for B
B is true only i f A is true
Those words "necessary" and "sufficient" are not always easy to master. The same
is true of the deceptively short phrase "if and only if." The two statements A* B and
A e B are completely different and they both require proof. That means two separate
proofs. But they can be stated together for convenience (when both are true):
A-B
A implies B and B implies A
A is equivalent to B
A is a necessary and suficient condition for B

RULES FOR LIMITS

Calculus needs a definition of limits, to define dyldx. That derivative contains two
limits: Ax + 0 and AylAx + dyldx. Calculus also needs rules for limits, to prove the
sum rule and product rule for derivatives. We started on the definition, and now we
start on the rules.
Given two convergent sequences, a, + L and b, + M, other sequences also converge:
Addition: a,

+ b, + L + M

Multiplication: a,b, -,LM

Subtraction: a, - b, -,L - M
Division: a,/b,

+ LIM

(provided M # 0)

We check the multiplication rule, which uses a convenient identity:
a,b, - LM = (a, - L)(b, - M) + M(a, - L) + L(b, - M).

(2)
Suppose Jan- LJ< E beyond some point N, and 1 b, - MI < E beyond some other point
N'. Then beyond the larger.of N and N', the right side of (2) is small. It is less than
E E + ME+ LE. This proves that (2) gives a,b, + LM.
An important special case is can-,cL. (The sequence of b's is c, c, c, c, ....) Thus a
constant can be brought "outside" the limit, to give lim can= c lim a,.

THE LIMIT OF f ( x ) AS x -,a

The final step is to replace sequences by functions. Instead of a,, a2, ... there is a
continuum of values f(x). The limit is taken as x approaches a specified point a
(instead of n -, co). Example: As x approaches a = 0, the function f (x) = 4 - x2
approaches L = 4. As x approaches a = 2, the function 5x approaches L = 10. Those
statements are fairly obvious, but we have to say what they mean. Somehow it must
be this:
i f x is close to a then f (x) is close to L.
If x - a is small, then f (x) - L should be small. As before, the word small does not
say everything. We really mean "arbitrarily small," or "below any E." The difference
f(x) - L must become as small as anyone wants, when x gets near a. In that case
lim,,, f (x) = L. Or we write f (x) -,L as x -,a.
The statement is awkward because it involves two limits. The limit x + a is forcing
f (x) + L. (Previously n + co forced a, + L.) But it is wrong to expect the same E in
both limits. We do not and cannot require that Jx- a1 < E produces ) f (x) - LI < E.
It may be necessary to push x extremely close to a (closer than E).We must guarantee
that if x is close enough to a, then If (x) - LI < E.
We have come to the "epsilon-delta definition" of limits. First, Socrates chooses E.
He has to be shown that f (x) is within E of L, for every x near a. Then somebody
else (maybe Plato) replies with a number 6. That gives the meaning of "near a."
Plato's goal is to get f(x) within E of L, by keeping x within 6 of a:

if 0 < lx - a1 < S

then

(f(x) - LI < E .

(3)

The input tolerance is 6 (delta), the output tolerance is E. When Plato can find a 6
for every E, Socrates concedes that the limit is L.
EXAMPLE Prove that lim 5x = 10. In this case a = 2 and L = 10.
x+2

Socrates asks for 15x - 101 < E. Plato responds by requiring Ix - 21 < 6. What 6 should
he choose? In this case 15x - 101 is exactly 5 times Jx- 21. So Plato picks 6 below ~ / 5
(a smaller 6 is always OK). Whenever J x- 21 < 45, multiplication by 5 shows that
15x - 101< E.
Remark 1 In Figure 2.19, Socrates chooses the height of the box. It extends above
and below L, by the small number E. Second, Plato chooses the width. He must make
the box narrow enough for the graph to go out the sides. Then If (x) - Ll< E.

1

limit L is not f ( o )

f ( x ) = step function
I
I

Fig. 2.19 S chooses height 2.5, then P chooses width 26. Graph must go out the sides.

When f(x) has a jump, the box can't hold it. A step function has no limit as x
approaches the jump, because the graph goes through the top or bottom-no matter
how thin the box.
Remark 2 The second figure has f (x) + L, because in taking limits we ignore the
Jinalpoint x = a. The value f (a) can be anything, with no effect on L. The first figure
has more: f (a) equals L. Then a special name applies- f is continuous.The left figure
shows a continuous function, the other figures do not.
We soon come back to continuous functions.
Remark 3 In the example with f = 5x and 6 = 45, the number 5 was the slope. That
choice barely kept the graph in the box-it goes out the corners. A little narrower,
say 6 = ~110,and the graph goes safely out the sides. A reasonable choice is
to divide E by 21ff(a)l. (We double the slope for safety.) I want to say why this 6
works-even if the E-6 test is seldom used in practice.
The ratio off (x) - L to x - a is distance up over distance across. This is Af/Ax,
close to the slope f'(a). When the distance across is 6, the distance up or down is
near 61ff(a)l. That equals ~ / for
2 our "reasonable choice" of 6-so we are safely
below E. This choice solves most exercises. But Example 7 shows that a limit might
exist even when the slope is infinite.
EXAMPLE 7

lim ,/x

x+1+

- 1= 0

(a one-sided limit).

Notice the plus sign in the symbol x + 1+ . The number x approaches a = 1 only from
above. An ordinary limit x + 1 requires us to accept x on both sides of 1 (the exact
value x = 1 is not considered). Since negative numbers are not allowed by the square
root, we have a one-sided limit. It is L = 0.
Suppose E is 1/10. Then the response could be 6 = 1/100. A number below 1/100
has a square root below 1/10. In this case the box must be made extremely
narrow, 6 much smaller than E, because the square root starts with infinite slope.
Those examples show the point of the 6-6 definition. (Given E, look for 6. This
came from Cauchy in France, not Socrates in Greece.) We also see its bad feature:
The test is not convenient. Mathematicians do not go around proposing 8's and
replying with 8's. We may live a strange life, but not that strange.
It is easier to establish once and for all that 5x approaches its obvious limit 5a.
The same is true for other familiar functions: xn+ an and sin x + sin a and
(1 - x)- -t (1 - a)- '-except at a = 1. The correct limit L comes by substituting
x = a into the function. This is exactly the property of a "continuousfunction." Before
the section on continuous functions, we prove the Squeeze Theorem using E and 6.

'

Proof g(x) is squeezed between f (x) and h(x). After subtracting L, g(x) - L is between
f (x) - L and h(x) - L. Therefore

Ig(x) - LI < E if If(x) - L( < E

and Ih(x)- LJ< E .

For any E, the last two inequalities hold in some region 0 < Jx- a1 < 6. So the first
one also holds. This proves that g(x) + L. Values at x = a are not involved-until
we get to continuous functions.

2.7 Continuous Functions - 1
This will be a brief section. It was originally included with limits, but the combination
was too long. We are still concerned with the limit off (x) as x -,a, but a new number
is involved. That number is f (a), the value off at x = a. For a "limit," x approached
a but never reached it-so f(a) was ignored. For a "continuous function," this final
number f (a) must be right.
May I summarize the usual (good) situation as x approaches a?
1. The number f (a) exists (f is defined at a)
2. The limit of f (x) exists (it was called L)
3. The limit L equals f (a) (f (a) is the right value)

In such a case, f (x) is continuous at x = a. These requirements are often written in a
single line: f (x) +f (a) as x -,a. By way of contrast, start with four functions that are
not continuous at x = 0.

Fig. 2.20 Four types of discontinuity (others are possible) at x = 0.

In Figure 2.20, the first function would be continuous if it had f (0) = 0. But it has
f (0) = 1. After changing f (0) to the right value, the problem is gone. The discontinuity
is removable. Examples 2, 3, 4 are more important and more serious. There is no
"correct" value for f (0):
2. f (x) = step function (jump from 0 to 1 at x = 0)
3. f (x) = 1/x2 (infinite limit as x + 0)
4. f (x) = sin (1/x) (infinite oscillation as x + 0).
The graphs show how the limit fails to exist. The step function has a jump discontinuity. It has one-sided limits, from the left and right. It does not have an ordinary (twosided) limit. The limit from the left (x + 0-) is 0. The limit from the right (x + 0')
is 1. Another step function is x/lxl, which jumps from - 1 to 1.
In the graph of l/x2, the only reasonable limit is L= + co. I cannot go on record
as saying that this limit exists. Officially, it doesn't-but we often write it anyway:
l/x2 + m as x + 0. This means that l/x2 goes (and stays) above every L as x + 0.
In the same unofficial way we write one-sided limits for f (x) = l/x:
From the left, lim
x+o-

1

- = - co.

From the right, lim

x+o+ X

+ oo.

(1)

Remark l/x has a "pole" at x = 0. So has l/x2 (a double pole). The function
l/(x2 - X) has poles at x = 0 and x = 1. In each case the denominator goes to zero
and the function goes to + oo or - oo. Similarly llsin x has a pole at every multiple
of n (where sin x is zero). Except for l/x2 these poles are "simplew-the functions are
completely smooth at x = 0 when we multiply them by x:

(x)(!-)

=1 and (x)

1

and ( )

(A)

are continuous at x = 0.

l/x2 has a double pole, since it needs multiplication by x2 (not just x). A ratio of
polynomials P(x)/Q(x) has poles where Q = 0, provided any common factors like
(X
1)/(x + 1) are removed first.
Jumps and poles are the most basic discontinuities, but others can occur. The
fourth graph shows that sin(l/x) has no limit as x + 0. This function does not blow
up; the sine never exceeds 1. At x = 4 and $ and & it equals sin 3 and sin 4 and
sin 1000. Those numbers are positive and negative and (?). As x gets small and l/x
gets large, the sine oscillates faster and faster. Its graph won't stay in a small box of
height E , no matter how narrow the box.

CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS
DEFINITION f is "continuous at x = a" if f (a) is defined and f (x) 4f (a) as x -, a.
Iff is continuous at every point where it is defined, it is a continuousfunction.

2.7

Continuous FuncHons

Objection The definition makes f(x)= 1/x a continuous function! It is not defined
at x = 0, so its continuity can't fail. The logic requires us to accept this, but we don't
have to like it. Certainly there is no f(0) that would make 1lx continuous at x = 0.
It is amazing but true that the definition of "continuous function" is still debated
(Mathematics Teacher, May 1989). You see the reason-we speak about a discontinuity of l/x, and at the same time call it a continuous function. The definition misses
the difference between 1/x and (sin x)/x. The function f(x) = (sin x)/x can be made

continuousat all x. Just set f(0) = 1.
We call a function "continuable'iif its definition can be extended to all x in a way
that makes it continuous. Thus (sin x)/x and \/; are continuable. The functions l/x
and tan x are not continuable. This suggestion may not end the debate, but I hope
it is helpful.
EXAMPLE

sin x and cos x and all polynomials P(x) are continuous functions.

EXAMPLE
2 The absolute value Ixl is continuous. Its slope jumps (not continuable).
EXAMPLE
3 Any rational function P(x)/Q(x) is continuous except where Q = 0.
EXAMPLE
4 The function that jumps between 1 at fractions and 0 at non-fractions
is discontinuous everywhere. There is a fraction between every pair of non-fractions
and vice versa. (Somehow there are many more non-fractions.)
EXAMPLE
5 The function 02 is zero for every x, except that 00 is not defined. So
define it as zero and this function is continuous. But see the next paragraph where
00 has to be 1.

We could fill the book with proofs of continuity, but usually the situation is clear.
"A function is continuous if you can draw its graph without lifting up your pen."
At a jump, or an infinite limit, or an infinite oscillation, there is no way across the
discontinuity except to start again on the other side. The function x" is continuous
for n > 0. It is not continuable for n < 0. The function x0 equals 1 for every x, except
that 00 is not defined. This time continuity requires 00 = 1.
The interesting examples are the close ones-we have seen two of them:
EXAMPLE
6

sin x
and
x

1 -cos x
x

are both continuable at x = 0.

Those were crucial for the slope of sin x. The first approaches 1 and the second
approaches 0. Strictly speaking we must give these functions the correct values
(1 and 0) at the limiting point x = O-which of course we do.
It is important to know what happens when the denominators change to x2.
EXAMPLE

Since (sin x)/x approaches 1, dividing by another x gives a function like 1lx. There
is a simple pole. It is an example of 0/0, in which the zero from x 2 is reached more
quickly than the zero from sin x. The "race to zero" produces almost all interesting
problems about limits.

This answer will be found again (more easily) by "1'HBpital's rule." Here I emphasize
not the answer but the problem. A central question of differential calculus is to know
how fast the limit is approached. The speed of approach is exactly the information in
the derivative.
These three examples are all continuous at x = 0. The race is controlled by the
slope-because f (x) -f (0) is nearly f '(0) times x:
derivative of sin x is 1
derivative of sin2x is 0

DIFFERENTIABLE FUNCTIONS

The absolute value 1x1 is continuous at x = 0 but has no derivative. The same is true
for x113. Asking for a derivative is more than asking for continuity. The reason is
fundamental, and carries us back to the key definitions:
Continuous at x: f (x + Ax) -f(x) -+ 0 as Ax
Derivative at x:

-+

0

f (x + A.u) -f ( x )
-+f"(x) as Ax -+ 0.
Ax

In the first case, Af goes to zero (maybe slowly). In the second case, Af goes to zero
as fast as Ax (because AflAx has a limit). That requirement is stronger:

21 At a point where f(x) has a derivative, the function must be continuous.
But f (x) can be continuous with no derivative.
Proof The limit of Af

= (Ax)(Af/Ax)

is (O)(df/dx) = 0. So f (x + Ax) -f (x) -+ 0.

The continuous function x113has no derivative at x = 0, because +xw2I3blows up.
The absolute value 1x1 has no derivative because its slope jumps. The remarkable
is continuous at all points and has a derivative at
function 4cos 3x + cos 9x +
no points. You can draw its graph without lifting your pen (but not easily-it turns
at every point). To most people, it belongs with space-filling curves and unmeasurable
areas-in a box of curiosities. Fractals used to go into the same box! They are
beautiful shapes, with boundaries that have no tangents. The theory of fractals is
very alive, for good mathematical reasons, and we touch on it in Section 3.7.
I hope you have a clear idea of these basic definitions of calculus:
1 Limit ( n

-+

,xor s -+a) 2 Continuity (at x = a) 3 Derivative (at x = a).

Those go back to E and 6, but it is seldom necessary to follow them so far. In the
same way that economics describes many transactions, or history describes many
events, a function comes from many values f (x). A few points may be special, like
market crashes or wars or discontinuities. At other points dfldx is the best guide to
the function.

2.7

Continuous Functions

This chapter ends with two essential facts about a continuousfunction on a closed
interval. The interval is a 6 x < b, written simply as [a, b1.t At the endpoints a and
b we require f (x) to approach f (a) and f (b).
Extreme Value Property A continuous function on the finite interval [a, b] has a
maximum value M and a minimum value m. There are points x,, and x, in [a, b]
where it reaches those values:
f(xmax)=M 3 f(x) 3 f(xmin)=m for all x in [a, b].
Intermediate Value Property If the number F is between f(a) and f(b), there is a
point c between a and b where f (c) = F. Thus if F is between the minimum m and
the maximum M, there is a point c between xminand x,, where f (c) = F.
Examples show why we require closed intervals and continuous functions. For
0 < x < 1 the function f (x) = x never reaches its minimum (zero). If we close the
interval by defining f (0) = 3 (discontinuous)the minimum is still not reached. Because
of the jump, the intermediate value F = 2 is also not reached. The idea of continuity
was inescapable, after Cauchy defined the idea of a limit.

Applications of the Derivative

Chapter 2 concentrated on computing derivatives. This chapter concentrates on using
them. Our computations produced dyldx for functions built from xn and sin x and
cos x. Knowing the slope, and if necessary also the second derivative, we can answer
the questions about y =f(x) that this subject was created for:
1. How does y change when x changes?
2. What is the maximum value of y? Or the minimum?
3. How can you tell a maximum from a minimum, using derivatives?
The information in dyldx is entirely local. It tells what is happening close to the point
and nowhere else. In Chapter 2, Ax and Ay went to zero. Now we want to get them
back. The local information explains the larger picture, because Ay is approximately
dyldx times Ax.
The problem is to connect the finite to the infinitesimal-the average slope to the
instantaneous slope. Those slopes are close, and occasionally they are equal. Points
of equality are assured by the Mean Value Theorem-which is the local-global
connection at the center of differential calculus. But we cannot predict where dyldx
equals AylAx. Therefore we now find other ways to recover a function from its
derivatives-or to estimate distance from velocity and acceleration.
It may seem surprising that we learn about y from dyldx. All our work has been
going the other way! We struggled with y to squeeze out dyldx. Now we use dyldx
to study y. That's life. Perhaps it really is life, to understand one generation from
later generations.

3.1 Linear Approximation
The book started with a straight line f = v t . The distance is linear when the velocity
is constant. As soon as v begins to change, f = v t falls apart. Which velocity do we
choose, when v ( t ) is not constant? The solution is to take very short time intervals,

in which v is nearly constant:

f

df = vdt

is exactly true.

For a brief moment the functionf(t) is linear-and stays near its tangent line.
In Section 2.3 we found the tangent line to y =f(x). At x = a, the slope of the curve
and the slope of the line are f'(a). For points on the line, start at y =f(a). Add the
slope times the "increment" x - a:

Y =f(a) +f '(a)(x- a).

(1)

We write a capital Y for the line and a small y for the curve. The whole point of
tangents is that they are close (provided we don't move too far from a):

That is the all- urpose linear approximation. Figure 3.1 shows the square root
lo,
function y = A n d its tangent line at x = a = 100. At the point y = @=
the slope is 1/2& = 1/20. The table beside the figure compares y(x) with Y(x).

Fig. 3.1

Y ( x )is the linear approximation to

f i near x = a = 100.

The accuracy gets worse as x departs from 100. The tangent line leaves the curve.
The arrow points to a good approximation at 102, and at 101 it would be even better.
In this example Y is larger than y-the straight line is above the curve. The slope of
the line stays constant, and the slope of the curve is decreasing. Such a curve will
soon be called "concave downward," and its tangent lines are above it.
Look again at x = 102, where the approximation is good. In Chapter 2, when we
were approaching dyldx, we started with Ay/Ax:
slope z

JiE-m
102- 100

'

Now that is turned around! The slope is 1/20. What we don't know is J102:

+ (slope)(102 - 100).

(4)

You work with what you have. Earlier we didn't know dyldx, so we used (3). Now
we are experts at dyldx, and we use (4). After computing y' = 1/20 once and for

&

all, the tangent line stays near
for every number near 100. When that nearby
number is 100 + Ax, notice the error as the approximation is squared:

The desired answer is 100 + Ax, and we are off by the last term involving AX)^. The
whole point of linear approximation is to ignore every term after Ax.
There is nothing magic about x = 100, except that it has a nice square root. Other
points and other functions allow y x Y I would like to express this same idea in
different symbols. Instead of starting from a and going to x, we start from x and go a
distance Ax to x Ax. The letters are different but the mathematics is identical.

e, the all-important number in Chapter 6. The binomial formula shows why the

It is too big to overlook. The exact error is
f"(c), where the Mean Value
Theorem in Section 3.8 places c between x and x + Ax. You already see the point:
y - Y is of order AX)^. Linear approximation, quadratic error.
DIFFERENTIALS

There is one more notation for this linear approximation. It has to be presented,
because it is often used. The notation is suggestive and confusing at the same time-

3 Applications of the Derivative

it keeps the same symbols dx and dy that appear in the derivative. Earlier we took
great pains to emphasize that dyldx is not an ordinary fraction.7 Until this paragraph,
dx and dy have had no independent meaning. Now they become separate variables,
like x and y but with their own names. These quantities dx and dy are called
dzrerentials.
The symbols dx and dy measure changes along the tangent line. They do for the
approximation Y(x) exactly what Ax and Ay did for y(x). Thus dx and Ax both
measure distance across.
Figure 3.2 has Ax = dx. But the change in y does not equal the change in Y. One
is Ay (exact for the function). The other is dy (exact for the tangent line). The
differential dy is equal to AY, the change along the tangent line. Where Ay is the true
change, dy is its linear approximation (dy/dx)dx.
You often see dy written as f'(x)dx.

Ay = change in y (along curve)
Y

dy = change in Y (along tangent)

-Axx=a

Fig. 3.2 The linear approximation to Ay is

dy =f '(x)dx.

x+dx=x+Ax

EmMPLE 3 y = x2 has dyldx = 2x so dy = 2x dx. The table has basepoint x = 2.
The prediction dy differs from the true Ay by exactly (Ax)2= .0l and .04 and .09.

The differential dy =f'(x)dx is consistent with the derivative dyldx =f'(x). We
finally have dy = (dy/dx)dx, but this is not as obvious as it seems! It looks like
cancellation-it is really a definition. Entirely new symbols could be used, but dx
and dy have two advantages: They suggest small steps and they satisfy dy =f'(x)dx.
Here are three examples and three rules:
d(sin x) = cos x dx

d(cf) = c df

Science and engineering and virtually all applications of mathematics depend on
linear approximation. The true function is "linearized,"using its slope v:
Increasing the time by At increases the distance by x vAt
Increasing the force by Af increases the deflection by x vAf
Increasing the production by Ap increases its value by z vAp.
+Fraction or not, it is absolutely forbidden to cancel the d's.

3.1 Linear Approximation

The goal of dynamics or statics or economics is to predict this multiplier v-the
derivative that equals the slope of the tangent line. The multiplier gives a local
prediction of the change in the function. The exact law is nonlinear-but Ohm's law
and Hooke's law and Newton's law are linear approximations.
ABSOLUTE CHANGE, RELATIVE CHANGE, PERCENTAGE CHANGE

The change Ay or Af can be measured in three ways. So can Ax:

Percentage change
Relative change is often more realistic than absolute change. If we know the distance
to the moon within three miles, that is more impressive than knowing our own height
within one inch. Absolutely, one inch is closer than three miles. Relatively, three miles
is much closer:
3 miles

or .001%< 1.4%.

EXAMPLE 4 The radius of the Earth is within 80 miles of r = 4000 miles.

(a) Find the variation dV in the volume V = jnr3, using linear approximation.
(b) Compute the relative variations dr/r and dV/V and AV/K
Solution The job of calculus is to produce the derivative. After dV/dr = 4nr2, its
work is done. The variation in volume is dV = 4n(4000)'(80) cubic miles. A 2%
relative variation in r gives a 6% relative variation in V:

Without calculus we need the exact volume at r = 4000 + 80 (also at r = 3920):

One comment on dV = 4nr2dr. This is (area of sphere) times (change in radius). It is
the volume of a thin shell around the sphere. The shell is added when the radius
grows by dr. The exact AV/V is 3917312/640000%, but calculus just calls it 6%.

Our goal is to learn about f(x) from dfldx. We begin with two quick questions.
If dfldx is positive, what does that say about f ? If the slope is negative, how is that
reflected in the function? Then the third question is the critical one:
How do you identify a maximum or minimum?

Normal answer: The slope is zero.

This may be the most important application of calculus, to reach df1d.x = 0.
Take the easy questions first. Suppose dfldx is positive for every x between a and b.
All tangent lines slope upward. The function f(x) is increasing a s x goes from n to b.

3B If dfldx > 0 then f(x) is increasing. If dfldx < 0 then f(x) is decreasing.
To define increasing and decreasing, look at any two points x < X . "Increasing"
requires f(x) <f ( X ) . "Decreasing" requires j(x) >f ( X ) . A positive slope does not mean
a positive function. The function itself can be positive or negative.
EXAMPLE 1 f(x) = x2 - 2x has slope 2x - 2. This slope is positive when x > 1 and
negative when x < 1. The function increases after x = 1 and decreases before x = 1.

3.2

Maximum and Minimum Problems

-

+. Slope is + - + - + so f is up-down-up-down-up.

We say that without computing f ( x ) at any point! The parabola in Figure 3.3 goes
down to its minimum at x = 1 and up again.
EXAMPLE 2 x2 - 2x + 5 has the same slope. Its graph is shifted up by 5, a number
that disappears in dfldx. All functions with slope 2x - 2 are parabolas x 2 - 2x + C,
shifted up or down according to C. Some parabolas cross the x axis (those crossings
are solutions to f ( x ) = 0). Other parabolas stay above the axis. The solutions to
x2 - 2x + 5 = 0 are complex numbers and we don't see them. The special parabola
x2 - 2x + 1 = ( x - 1)2 grazes the axis at x = 1. It has a "double zero," where f ( x ) =
dfldx = 0.
EXAMPLE 3 Suppose dfldx = (x- l ) ( x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4). This slope is positive
beyond x = 4 and up to x = 1 (dfldx = 24 at x = 0). And dfldx is positive again
between 2 and 3. At x = 1, 2, 3,4, this slope is zero and f ( x ) changes direction.
Here f ( x ) is a fifth-degree polynomial, because f ' ( x ) is fourth-degree. The graph of
f goes up-down-up-down-up. It might cross the x axis five times. It must cross
at least once (like this one). When complex numbers are allowed, every fifth-degree
polynomial has five roots.

You may feel that "positive slope implies increasing function" is obvious-perhaps
it is. But there is still something delicate. Starting from dfldx > 0 at every single point,
we have to deduce f ( X ) >f ( x ) at pairs of points. That is a "local to global" question,
to be handled by the Mean Value Theorem. It could also wait for the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus: The diflerence f ( X ) -f ( x ) equals the area under the graph of
dfldx. That area is positive, so f ( X ) exceeds f(x).
MAXIMA AND MINIMA

Which x makes f ( x ) as large as possible? Where is the smallest f(x)? Without calculus
we are reduced to computing values of f ( x ) and comparing. With calculus, the information is in dfldx.
Suppose the maximum or minimum is at a particular point x. It is possible that
the graph has a corner-and no derivative. But ifdfldx exists, it must be zero. The
tangent line is level. The parabolas in Figure 3.3 change from decreasing to increasing.
The slope changes from negative to positive. At this crucial point the slope is zero.

3 Applications of the Derivative

3C Local Maximum or Minimum Suppose the maximum or minimum
occurs at a point x inside an interval where f(x) and df[dx are defined. Then
f '(x) = 0.
The word "local" allows the possibility that in other intervals, f(x) goes higher or
lower. We only look near x, and we use the definition of dfldx.
Start with f(x + Ax) -f(x). If f(x) is the maximum, this difference is negative or
zero. The step Ax can be forward or backward:
if Ax > 0:
if Ax < 0:

f(x

+ AX)-f(x) ---negative < 0
Ax

positive

df 6 0.
and in the limit dx

f(x+Ax)-f(x) -df 3 0.
- negative 2 0 and in the limit Ax
negative
dx

Both arguments apply. Both conclusions dfldx
dfldx = 0.

< 0 and dfldx 2 0 are correct. Thus

Maybe Richard Feynman said it best. He showed his friends a plastic curve that
was made in a special way - "no matter how you turn it, the tangent at the lowest
point is horizontal." They checked it out. It was true.
Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! is a good book (but rough on mathematicians).
EXAMPLE 3 (continued) Look back at Figure 3.3b. The points that stand out

are not the "ups" or "downs" but the "turns." Those are stationary points, where
dfldx = 0. We see two maxima and two minima. None of them are absolute maxima
or minima, because f(x) starts at - co and ends at + co.
EXAMPLE 4 f(x) = 4x3 - 3x4 has slope 12x2 - 12x3. That derivative is zero when
x2 equals x3, at the two points x = 0 and x = 1. To decide between minimum and

maximum (local or absolute), the first step is to evaluate f(x) at these stationary points.
We find f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1.
Now look at large x. The function goes down to - co in both directions. (You can
mentally substitute x = 1000 and x = - 1000). For large x, - 3x4 dominates 4x3.
Conclusion f = 1 is an absolute maximum. f = 0 is not a maximum or minimum
(local or absolute). We have to recognize this exceptional possibility, that a curve (or
a car) can pause for an instant (f' = 0) and continue in the same direction. The reason
is the "double zero" in 12x2 - 12x3, from its double factor x2.

EXAMPLE 5 Define f(x) = x x-I for x > 0. Its derivative 1 - 1/x2 is zero at x = 1.
At that point f(1) = 2 is the minimum value. Every combination like f + 3 or 4 +
is larger than fmin = 2. Figure 3.4 shows that the maximum of x + x- is + oo.?

'

Important The maximum always occurs at a stationarypoint (where dfldx = 0) or a
rough point (no derivative) or an endpoint of the domain. These are the three types
of critical points. All maxima and minima occur at critical points! At every other
point df/dx > 0 or df/dx < 0. Here is the procedure:
1. Solve df/dx = 0 to find the stationary points f(x).
2. Compute f(x) at every critical point-stationary point, rough point, endpoint.
3. Take the maximum and minimum of those critical values of f(x).
EXAMPLE 6 (Absolute value f(x) = 1x1) The minimum is zero at a rough point. The
maximum is at an endpoint. There are no stationary points.
The derivative of y = 1x1 is never zero. Figure 3.4 shows the maximum and minimum on the interval [- 3,2]. This is typical of piecewise linear functions.

Question Could the minimum be zero when the function never reaches f(x) = O?
Answer Yes, f(x) = 1/(1+ x ) approaches
~
but never reaches zero as x + oo.

+

Remark 1 x + f oo and f(x) -, oo are avoided when f is continuous on a closed
interval a < x < b. Then f(x) reaches its maximum and its minimum (Extreme Value
Theorem). But x -,oo and f(x) + oo are too important to rule out. You test x + ca
by considering large x. You recognizef(x) + oo by going above every finite value.
Remark 2 Note the difference between critical points (specified by x) and critical
values (specified by f(x)). The example x + x- had the minimum point x = 1 and the
minimum value f(1) = 2.
MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM IN APPLICATIONS

To find a maximum or minimum, solve f'(x) = 0. The slope is zero at the top and
bottom of the graph. The idea is clear-and then check rough points and endpoints.
But to be honest, that is not where the problem starts.
In a real 'application, the first step (often the hardest) is to choose the unknown
and find the function. It is we ourselves who decide on x and f(x). The equation
dfldx = 0 comes in the middle of the problem, not at the beginning. I will start on
a new example, with a question instead of a function.
EXAMPLE 7 Where should you get onto an expressway for minimum driving time,
if the expressway speed is 60 mph and ordinary driving speed is 30 mph?

I know this problem well-it comes up every morning. The Mass Pike goes to MIT
and I have to join it somewhere. There is an entrance near Route 128 and another
entrance further in. I used to take the second one, now I take the first. Mathematics
should decide which is faster-some mornings I think they are maxima.
Most models are simplified, to focus on the key idea. We will allow the expressway
to be entered at any point x (Figure 3.5). Instead of two entrances (a discrete problem)
?A good word is approach when f (x) + a.Infinity is not reached. But I still say "the maximum
is XI."

f ' ( x )= -- (a2+ x 2 )- lI2(2x)- 30 2

To solve f '(x) = 0 , multiply by 60 and square both sides:

(a2+ x 2 ) - 'I2(2x)= 1

gives 2x = (a2+ x2)'I2 and

4x2 = a2 + x2.

(2)

Thus 3x2 = a2. This yields two candidates, x = a/& and x = - a/&. But a
negative x would mean useless driving on the expressway. In fact f' is not zero at
x = - a/&. That false root entered when we squared 2x.

I notice something surprising. The stationary point x = a/& does not depend on
b. The total time includes the constant b/60, which disappeared in dfldx. Somehow
b must enter the answer, and this is a warning to go carefully. The minimum might
occur at a rough point or an endpoint. Those are the other critical points off, and
our drawing may not be realistic. Certainly we expect x 6 b, or we are entering the

Maximum and Minimum Problems

The comparison f * <f ** should be automatic. Entering at x = 0 was a candidate
and calculus didn't choose it. The derivative is not zero at x = 0. It is not smart to
go perpendicular to the expressway.
The second comparison has x = b. We drive directly to MIT at speed 30. This
option has to be taken seriously. In fact it is optimal when b is small or a is large.
This choice x = b can arise mathematically in two ways. If all entrances are between
0 and b, then b is an endpoint. If we can enter beyond MIT, then b is a rough point.
The graph in Figure 3 . 5 ~has a corner at x = b, where the derivative jumps. The
reason is that distance on the expressway is the absolute value Ib - XI-never negative.
Either way x = b is a critical point. The optimal x is the smaller of a/& and b.

The heart of this subject is in "word problems." All the calculus is in a few lines,
computing f ' and solving f '(x) = 0. The formulation took longer. Step 1 usually does:
1. Express the quantity to be minimized or maximized as a function f(x).
The variable x has to be selected.
2. Compute f '(x), solve f '(x) = 0, check critical points for fmin and fmax.

A picture of the problem (and the graph of f(x)) makes all the difference.
EXAMPLE 7 (continued) Choose x as an angle instead of a distance. Figure 3.6

shows the triangle with angle x and side a. The driving distance to the expressway is
a sec x. The distance on the expressway is b - a tan x. Dividing by the speeds 30 and
60, the driving time has a nice form:

3 Applications of the Derivative

EXAMPLE 8 In mechanics, nature chooses minimum energy. A spring is pulled down
by a mass, the energy is f(x), and dfldx = 0 gives equilibrium. It is a philosophical
question why so many laws of physics involve minimum energy or minimum timewhich makes the mathematics easy.
The energy has two terms-for the spring and the mass. The spring energy is
+kx2-positive in stretching (x > 0 is downward) and also positive in compression
(x < 0). The potential energy of the mass is taken as - mx-decreasing as the mass
goes down. The balance is at the minimum of f(x) = 4 kx2 - mx.
I apologize for giving you such a small problem, but it makes a crucial point.
When f(x) is quadratic, the equilibrium equation dfldx = 0 is linear.

Graphically, x = m/k is at the bottom of the parabola. Physically, kx = m is a balance
of forces-the spring force against the weight. Hooke's law for the spring force is
elastic constant k times displacement x.
EXAMPLE 9 Derivative of cost = marginal cost (our first management example).

The paper to print x copies of this book might cost C = 1000 + 3x dollars. The
derivative is dCldx = 3. This is the marginal cost of paper for each additional book.
If x increases by one book, the cost C increases by $3. The marginal cost is like the
velocity and the total cost is like the distance.
Marginal cost is in dollars per book. Total cost is in dollars. On the plus side, the
income is I(x) and the marginal income is dlldx. To apply calculus, we overlook the
restriction to whole numbers.
Suppose the number of books increases by dx.? The cost goes up by (dCldx) dx.
The income goes up by (dlldx) dx. If we skip all other costs, then profit P(x) =
income I(x) - cost C(x). In most cases P increases to a maximum and falls back.
At the high point on the profit curve, the marginal profit is zero:

Profit is maximized when marginal income I' equals marginal cost C ' .

This basic rule of economics comes directly from calculus, and we give an example:
C(x) = cost of x advertisements = 900 + 400x - x2
setup cost 900, print cost 400x, volume savings x2
I(x) = income due to x advertisements = 600x - 6x2
sales 600 per advertisement, subtract 6x2 for diminishing returns
optimal decision dCldx = dI/dx or 400 - 2x = 600 - 12x or x = 20

cost

=

9600 - 8500 = 1 100.

The next section shows how to verify that this profit is a maximum not a minimum.
The first exercises ask you to solve dfldx = 0. Later exercises also look for f(x).

+Maybe dx is a differential calculus book. I apologize for that.

3.3 Second Derivatives: Bending and Acceleration
When f '(x) is positive, f(x) is increasing. When dyldx is negative, y(x) is decreasing.
That is clear, but what about the second derivative? From looking at the curve,
can you decide the sign off "(x) or d2y/dx2?The answer is yes and the key is in the
bending.
A straight line doesn't bend. The slope of y = mx + b is m (a constant). The second
derivative is zero. We have to go to curves, to see a changing slope. Changes in the
herivative show up in fv(x):
f = x2 has f' = 2x and f " = 2 (this parabola bends up)

y = sin x has dyldx = cos x and d 'y/dx2 = - sin x (the sine bends down)

3 Applications of the Derivative

The slope 2x gets larger even when the parabola is falling. The sign off or f ' is not
revealed by f ". The second derivative tells about change in slope.
A function with f "(x) > 0 is concave up. It bends upward as the slope increases. It
is also called convex. A function with decreasing slope-this means f "(x) < 0-is
concave down. Note how cos x and 1 + cos x and even 1 + $x + cos x change from
concave down to concave up at x = 7~12.At that point f " = - cos x changes from
negative to positive. The extra 1 + $x tilts the graph but the bending is the same.

tangent below

Fig. 3.7

Increasing slope = concave up (f" > 0). Concave down is f" < 0. Inflection point f" = 0.

Here is another way to see the sign off ". Watch the tangent lines. When the curve
is concave up, the tangent stays below it. A linear approximation is too low. This
section computes a quadratic approximation-which includes the term with f " > 0.
When the curve bends down (f" < O), the opposite happens-the tangent lines are
above the curve. The linear approximation is too high, and f " lowers it.
AcceleraIn physical motion, f "(t) is the acceleration-in units of di~tance/(time)~.
tion is rate of change of velocity. The oscillation sin 2t has v = 2 cos 2t (maximum
speed 2) and a = - 4 sin 2t (maximum acceleration 4).
An increasing population means f ' > 0. An increasing growth rate means f " > 0.
Those are different. The rate can slow down while the growth continues.
MAXIMUM VS. MINIMUM

Remember that f '(x) = 0 locates a stationary point. That may be a minimum or a
maximum. The second derivative decides! Instead of computing f(x) at many points,
we compute f "(x) at one point-the stationary point. It is a minimum iff "(x) > 0.

3D When f '(x) = 0 and f "(x) > 0, there is a local minimum at x.
When f '(x) = 0 and f "(x) < 0,there is a local maximrcm at x.
To the left of a minimum, the curve is falling. After the minimum, the curve rises. The
slope has changed from negative to positive. The graph bends upward and f "(x)> 0.
At a maximum the slope drops from positive to negative. In the exceptional case,
when f '(x) = 0 and also f "(x) = 0, anything can happen. An example is x3, which
pauses at x = 0 and continues up (its slope is 3x2 2 0). However x4 pauses and goes
down (with a very flat graph).
We emphasize that the information from fr(x) and f "(x) is only "local ." To be
certain of an absolute minimum or maximum, we need information over the whole
domain.

3.3 Second Derhmthres: Bending and Acceleration

EXAMPLE I f(x) = x3 - x2 has f '(x) = 3x2 - 2x and f "(x) = 6x - 2.

To find the maximum and/or minimum, solve 3x2 - 2x = 0. The stationary points
are x = 0 and x = f . At those points we need the second derivative. It is f "(0) = - 2
(local maximum) and f "(4)= + 2 (local minimum).
Between the maximum and minimum is the inflection point. That is where
f "(x) = 0. The curve changes from concave down to concave up. This example has
f "(x) = 6x - 2, so the inflection point is at x = 4.
INFLECTION POINTS

In mathematics it is a special event when a function passes through zero. When the
function isf, its graph crosses the axis. When the function is f', the tangent line is
horizontal. When f " goes through zero, we have an injection point.
The direction of bending changes at an inflection point. Your eye picks that out in
a graph. For an instant the graph is straight (straight lines have f " = 0). It is easy to
see crossing points and stationary points and inflection points. Very few people can
recognize where f "'= 0 or f '" = 0. I am not sure if those points have names.
There is a genuine maximum or minimum when f '(x) changes sign. Similarly, there
is a genuine inflection point when f "(x) changes sign. The graph is concave down on
one side of an inflection point and concave up on the other side.? The tangents are
above the curve on one side and below it on the other side. At an inflection point,
the tangent line crosses the curve (Figure 3.7b).
Notice that a parabola y = ax2 + bx + c has no inflection points: y" is constant. A
cubic curve has one inflection point, becausef " is linear. A fourth-degree curve might
or might not have inflection points-the quadratic fM(x)might or might not cross
the axis.

Between zeros of f(x) come zeros off '(x) (stationary points). Between zeros off '(x)
come zeros off "(x) (inflection points). In this examplef(x) has a double zero at the
origin, so a single zero off' is caught there. It is a local maximum, since f "(0) < 0.
Inflection points are important-not just for mathematics. We know the world
population will keep rising. We don't know if the rate of growth will slow down.
Remember: The rate of growth stops growing at the inflection point. Here is the 1990
report of the UN Population Fund.
The next ten years will decide whether the world population trebles or merely
doubles before it finally stops growing. This may decide the future of the earth as
a habitation for humans. The population, now 5.3 billion, is increasing by a quarter
of a million every day. Between 90 and 100 million people will be added every year
?That rules out f (x) = x4, which has f" = 12x2 > 0 on both sides of zero. Its tangent line is
the x axis. The line stays below the graph-so no inflection point.

3 Applications of the Derivative

during the 1990s; a billion people-a whole China-over the decade. The fastest
growth will come in the poorest countries.
A few years ago it seemed as if the rate of population growth was slowing?
everywhere except in Africa and parts of South Asia. The world's population
seemed set to stabilize around 10.2 billion towards the end of the next century.
Today, the situation looks less promising. The world has overshot the marker
points of the 1984 "most likely" medium projection. It is now on course for an
eventual total that will be closer to 11 billion than to 10 billion.
If fertility reductions continue to be slower than projected, the mark could be
missed again. In that case the world could be headed towards a total of up to 14
billion people.
Starting with a census, the UN follows each age group in each country. They
estimate the death rate and fertility rate-the medium estimates are published. This
report is saying that we are not on track with the estimate.
Section 6.5 will come back to population, with an equation that predicts 10 billion.
It assumes we are now at the inflection point. But China's second census just started
on July 1 , 1990. When it's finished we will know if the inflection point is still ahead.
You now understand the meaning off "(x).Its sign gives the direction of bendingthe change in the slope. The rest of this section computes how much the curve bendsusing the size off" and not just its sign. We find quadratic approximations based on
fl'(x). In some courses they are optional-the main points are highlighted.
CENTERED DIFFERENCES AND SECOND DIFFERENCES

Calculus begins with average velocities, computed on either side of x:

We never mentioned it, but a better approximation to J"(x)comes from averaging
those two averages. This produces a centered difference, which is based on x + A x
and x - A x . It divides by 2 A x :

We claim this is better. The test is to try it on powers of x.
For f ( x ) = x these ratios all give f' = 1 (exactly). For f ( x ) = x 2 , only the centered
difference correctly gives f' = 2x. The one-sided ratio gave 2.x + Ax (in Chapter 1 it
was 2t + h). It is only "first-order accurate." But centering leaves no error. We are
averaging 2x + Ax with 2x - A x . Thus the centered difference is "second-order
accurate."
I ask now: What ratio converges to the second derivative? One answer is to take
differences of the first derivative. Certainly Af'lAx approaches f ". But we want a
ratio involving f itself. A natural idea is to take diflerences of diferences, which
brings us to "second differences":

3.3 Second Derivatives: Bending and Acceleration

On the top, the difference of the difference is A(Af)= A2 f. It corresponds to d 2f.
On the bottom, (Ax)2 corresponds to dx 2 . This explains the way we place the 2's in
d 2f/dx 2. To say it differently: dx is squared, dfis not squared-as in distance/(time) 2.
Note that (Ax)2 becomes much smaller than Ax. If we divide Af by (Ax) 2, the ratio
blows up. It is the extra cancellation in the second difference A2fthat allows the limit
to exist. That limit is f"(x).
Application The great majority of differential equations can't be solved exactly.
A typical case is f"(x) = - sinf(x) (the pendulum equation). To compute a solution,
I would replace f"(x) by the second difference in equation (3). Approximations at
points spaced by Ax are a very large part of scientific computing.
To test the accuracy of these differences, here is an experiment on f(x)=
sin x + cos x. The table shows the errors at x = 0 from formulas (1), (2), (3):

The one-sided errors are cut in half when Ax is cut in half. The other columns
decrease like (Ax) 2 . Each reduction divides those errors by 4. The errorsfrom onesided differences are O(Ax) and the errorsfrom centered differences are O(Ax) 2.
The "big 0" notation When the errors are of order Ax, we write E = O(Ax). This
means that E < CAx for some constant C. We don't compute C-in fact we don't
want to deal with it. The statement "one-sided errors are Oh of delta x" captures
what is important. The main point of the other columns is E = O(Ax) 2 .
LINEAR APPROXIMATION VS. QUADRATIC APPROXIMATION
The second derivative gives a tremendous improvement over linear approximation
f(a) +f'(a)(x - a). A tangent line starts out close to the curve, but the line has no
way to bend. After a while it overshoots or undershoots the true function (see
Figure 3.8). That is especially clear for the model f(x) = x 2, when the tangent is the
x axis and the parabola curves upward.
You can almost guess the term with bending. It should involve f", and also (Ax) 2.
It might be exactly f"(x) times (Ax) 2 but it is not. The model function x 2 hasf" = 2.
There must be a factor 1 to cancel that 2:

At the basepoint this is f(a) =f(a). The derivatives also agree at x = a. Furthermore
the second derivatives agree. On both sides of (4), the second derivative at x = a is
f"(a).
The quadratic approximation bends with the function. It is not the absolutely
final word, because there is a cubic term -f"'(a)(x - a)3 and a fourth-degree term
4
N f""(a)(x - a) and so on. The whole infinite sum is a "Taylor series." Equation (4)
carries that series through the quadratic term-which for practical purposes gives a
terrific approximation. You will see that in numerical experiments.

109

3 Applications of the Derivative

Two things to mention. First, equation (4)shows whyf" > 0 brings the curve above
the tangent line. The linear part gives the line, while the quadratic part is positive
and bends upward. Second, equation (4) comes from (2) and (3). Where one-sided
differences give f(x A x ) x f(x) +f '(x)Ax,centered differences give the quadratic:

+

from (2): f(x

+ Ax)

a f(x - A x ) + 2 f f ( x )Ax

from (3): f ( x + A x ) a 2f(x)-f(x-A~)+f"(x)(Ax)~.

3 Applicutions of the Derivative

3.4 Graphs 1
Reading a graph is like appreciating a painting. Everything is there, but you have to
know what to look for. One way to learn is by sketching graphs yourself, and in the
past that was almost the only way. Now it is obsolete to spend weeks drawing
curves-a computer or graphing calculator does it faster and better. That doesn't
remove the need to appreciate a graph (or a painting), since a curve displays a
tremendous amount of information.
This section combines two approaches. One is to study actual machine-produced
graphs (especially electrocardiograms). The other is to understand the mathematics
of graphs-slope, concavity, asymptotes, shifts, and scaling. We introduce the
centering transform and zoom transform. These two approaches are like the rest of
calculus, where special derivatives and integrals are done by hand and day-to-day
applications are by computer. Both are essential-the machine can do experiments
that we could never do. But without the mathematics our instructions miss the point.
To create good graphs you have to know a few of them personally.

READING AN ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG or EKG)

The graphs of an ECG show the electrical potential during a heartbeat. There are
twelve graphs-six from leads attached to the chest, and six from leads to the arms
and left leg. (It doesn't hurt, but everybody is nervous. You have to lie still, because
contraction of other muscles will mask the reading from the heart.) The graphs record
electrical impulses, as the cells depolarize and the heart contracts.
What can I explain in two pages? The graph shows the fundamental pattern of the
ECG. Note the P wave, the Q R S complex, and the T wave. Those patterns, seen
differently in the twelve graphs, tell whether the heart is normal or out of rhythmor suffering an infarction (a heart attack).

First of all the graphs show the heart rate. The dark vertical lines are by convention

f second apart. The light lines are & second apart. If the heart beats every f second

(one dark line) the rate is 5 beats per second or 300 per minute. That is extreme
tachycardia-not compatible with life. The normal rate is between three dark lines
per beat (2 second, or 100 beats per minute) and five dark lines (one second between
beats, 60 per minute). A baby has a faster rate, over 100 per minute. In this figure
. A rate below 60 is bradycardia, not in itself dangerous. For a resting
the rate is
athlete that is normal.
Doctors memorize the six rates 300, 150, 100, 75, 60, 50. Those correspond to 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6 dark lines between heartbeats. The distance is easiest to measure between
spikes (the peaks of the R wave). Many doctors put a printed scale next to the chart.
One textbook emphasizes that "Where the next wave falls determines the rate. No
mathematical computation is necessary." But you see where those numbers come
from.

3.4 Graphs

The next thing to look for is heart rhythm. The regular rhythm is set by the
pacemaker, which produces the P wave. A constant distance between waves is goodand then each beat is examined. When there is a block in the pathway, it shows as
a delay in the graph. Sometimes the pacemaker fires irregularly. Figure 3.10 shows
sinus arrythmia (fairly normal). The time between peaks is changing. In disease or
emergency, there are potential pacemakers in all parts of the heart.
I should have pointed out the main parts. We have four chambers, an atriumventricle pair on the left and right. The SA node should be the pacemaker. The
stimulus spreads from the atria to the ventricles- from the small chambers that
"prime the pump" to the powerful chambers that drive blood through the body. The
P wave comes with contraction of the atria. There is a pause of & second at the AV
node. Then the big QRS wave starts contraction of the ventricles, and the T wave is
when the ventricles relax. The cells switch back to negative charge and the heart cycle
is complete.

Fig. 3.9 Happy person with a heart and a normal electrocardiogram.

The ECG shows when the pacemaker goes wrong. Other pacemakers take overthe AV node will pace at 60/minute. An early firing in the ventricle can give a wide
spike in the QRS complex, followed by a long pause. The impulses travel by a slow
path. Also the pacemaker can suddenly speed up (paroxysmal tachycardia is
150-250/minute). But the most critical danger is fibrillation.
Figure 3.10b shows a dying heart. The ECG indicates irregular contractions-no
normal PQRST sequence at all. What kind of heart would generate such a rhythm?
The muscles are quivering or "fibrillating" independently. The pumping action is
nearly gone, which means emergency care. The patient needs immediate CPRsomeone to do the pumping that the heart can't do. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation
is a combination of chest pressure and air pressure (hand and mouth) to restart the
rhythm. CPR can be done on the street. A hospital applies a defibrillator, which
shocks the heart back to life. It depolarizes all the heart cells, so the timing can be
reset. Then the charge spreads normally from SA node to atria to AV node to
ventricles.
This discussion has not used all twelve graphs to locate the problem. That needs
uectors. Look ahead at Section 11.1for the heart vector, and especially at Section 11.2
for its twelve projections. Those readings distinguish between atrium and ventricle,
left and right, forward and back. This information is of vital importance in the event
of a heart attack. A "heart attack" is a myocardial infarction (MI).
An MI occurs when part of an artery to the heart is blocked (a coronary occlusion).

3 Applications of the Derivative

Infarction

Rg. 3.10 Doubtful rhythm. Serious fibrillation. Signals of a heart attack.

An area is without blood supply-therefore without oxygen or glucose. Often the
attack is in the thick left ventricle, which needs the most blood. The cells are first
ischemic, then injured, and finally infarcted (dead). The classical ECG signals involve
those three 1's:
Ischemia: Reduced blood supply, upside-down T wave in the chest leads.
Injury: An elevated segment between S and T means a recent attack.
Infarction: The Q wave, normally a tiny dip or absent, is as wide as a small
square (& second). It may occupy a third of the entire QRS complex.
The Q wave gives the diagnosis. You can find all three I's in Figure 3.10~.
It is absolutely amazing how much a good graph can do.
THE MECHANICS OF GRAPHS

From the meaning of graphs we descend to the mechanics. A formula is now given
forf(x). The problem is to create the graph. It would be too old-fashioned to evaluate
Ax) by hand and draw a curve through a dozen points. A computer has a much
better idea of a parabola than an artist (who tends to make it asymptotic to a straight
line). There are some things a computer knows, and other things an artist knows,
and still others that you and I know-because we understand derivatives.
Our job is to apply calculus. We extract information from f ' and f " as well asf.
Small movements in the graph may go unnoticed, but the important properties come
through. Here are the main tests:
(above or below axis: f = 0 at crossing point)
1. The sign off (x)
(increasing or decreasing:f ' = 0 at stationary point)
2. The sign of f(x)
3. The sign of f"(x) (concave up or down: f" = 0 at injection point)
4. The behavior of f(x) as x + oo and x -, - oo
5. The points at which f(x) + oo or f(x) -, - oo
6. Even or odd?
Periodic?
Jumps in f o r f '?
Endpoints?

f(O)?

The sign of f(x) depends on 1 - x2. Thus f(x) > 0 in the inner interval where x2 < 1.
The graph bends upwards (f"(x) > 0) in that same interval. There are no inflection
points, since f " is never zero. The stationary point where f' vanishes is x = 0. We
have a local minimum at x = 0.
The guidelines (or asymptotes) meet the graph at infinity. For large x the important
terms are x2 and - x2. Their ratio is x2/-x2 = - 1-which is the limit as x -, or,
and x -, - oo. The horizontal asymptote is the line y = - 1.
The other infinities, where f blows up, occur when 1 - x2 is zero. That happens at
x = 1 and x = - 1. The vertical asymptotes are the lines x = 1 and x = -1. The graph

in Figure 3.1 l a approaches those lines.

ifflx) - (mx + b) + 0 as x -+ oo or - a , the line y = mx b is a sloping asymptote.

+

+

+

Finally comes the vital fact that this function is even:f(x) =f(- x) because squaring
x obliterates the sign. The graph is symmetric across the y axis.
To summarize the eflect of dividing by 1 - x2: No effect near x = 0. Blowup at 1
and - 1 from zero in the denominator. The function approaches -1 as 1x1 -+ oo.

f(x) =

f '(x)= ( x - I)2

f "(x)= ( X - 113

This example divides by x - 1. Therefore x = 1 is a vertical asymptote, where f(x)
becomes infinite. Vertical asymptotes come mostly from zero denominators.
Look beyond x = 1. Both f(x) and f"(x) are positive for x > 1. The slope is zero at
x = 2. That must be a local minimum.
What happens as x -+ oo? Dividing x2 by x - 1, the leading term is x. The function
becomes large. It grows linearly-we expect a sloping asymptote. To find it, do the
division properly:

The last term goes to zero. The function approaches y = x + 1 as the asymptote.
This function is not odd or even. Its graph is in Figure 3.11b. With zoom out you
see the asymptotes. Zoom in for f = 0 or f' = 0 or f" = 0.

Fig. 3.11 The graphs of x2/(1 - x2) and x2/(x - 1) and sin x + 3 sin 3x.

EXAMPLE 3 f(x) = sin x + sin 3x has the slope f '(x) = cos x + cos 3x.

Above all these functions are periodic. If x increases by 2n, nothing changes. The
graphs from 2n to 47c are repetitions of the graphs from 0 to 271. Thus f(x + 2 4 =f(x)
and the period is 2n. Any interval of length 27c will show a complete picture, and
Figure 3.1 1c picks the interval from - n to n.
The second outstanding property is that f is odd. The sine functions satisfy
f(- x) = -f(x). The graph is symmetric through the origin. By reflecting the right half
through the origin, you get the left half. In contrast, the cosines in f f ( x ) are even.
To find the zeros of f(x) and f'(x) and f "(x),rewrite those functions as

f(x) = 2 sin x - $ sin3x f'(x) = - 2 cos x + 4 cos3x f"(x) = - 10 sin x + 12 sin3x.

3 Applications of the Derivative
We changed sin 3x to 3 sin x - 4 sin3x. For the derivatives use sin2x = 1 - cos2x.
Now find the zeros-the crossing points, stationary points, and inflection points:

(maximum), 213 (local

I would like to mention a beautiful continuation of this same pattern:

:

f(x) = sin x + 3 sin 3x + sin 5x + ..-

f'(x)

= cos

x + cos 3x + cos 5x + -..

If we stop after ten terms, f(x) is extremely close to a step function. If we don't stop,
the exact step function contains infinitely many sines. It jumps from - 4 4 to + 4 4 as
x goes past zero. More precisely it is a "square wave," because the graph jumps back
down at n and repeats. The slope cos x + cos 3x + ..- also has period 2n. Infinitely
many cosines add up to a delta function! (The slope at the jump is an infinite spike.)
These sums of sines and cosines are Fourier series.
GRAPHS BY COMPUTERS AND CALCULATORS

We have come to a topic of prime importance. If you have graphing software for a
computer, or if you have a graphing calculator, you can bring calculus to life. A graph
presents y(x) in a new way-different from the formula. Information that is buried
in the formula is clear on the graph. But don't throw away y(x) and dyldx. The
derivative is far from obsolete.
These pages discuss how calculus and graphs go together. We work on a crucial
problem of applied mathematics-to find where y(x) reaches its minimum. There is
no need to tell you a hundred applications. Begin with the formula. How do you find
the point x* where y(x) is smallest?
First, draw the graph. That shows the main features. We should see (roughly) where
x* lies. There may be several minima, or possibly none. But what we see depends on
a decision that is ours to make-the range of x and y in the viewing window.
If nothing is known about y(x), the range is hard to choose. We can accept a default
range, and zoom in or out. We can use the autoscaling program in Section 1.7.
Somehow x* can be observed on the screen. Then the problem is to compute it.
I would like to work with a specific example. We solved it by calculus-to find
the best point x* to enter an expressway. The speeds in Section 3.2 were 30 and 60.
The length of the fast road will be b = 6. The range of reasonable valuesfor the entering
point is 0 < x < 6. The distance to the road in Figure 3.12 is a = 3. We drive a distance

Fig. 3.12 Enter at x. The graph of driving time y(x). Zoom boxes locate x*.

The solution is to change scale. Zoom in on x*. The tangent line stays flat, since
dyldx is still zero. But the bending from C is increased. Figure 3.12 shows the zoom
box blown up into a new graph of y(x).

A calculator has one or more ways to find x*. With a TRACE mode, you direct a
cursor along the graph. From the display of y values, read y,, and x* to the
nearest pixel. A zoom gives better accuracy, because it stretches the axes-each
pixel represents a smaller Ax and Ay. The TI-81 stretches by 4 as default. Even
better, let the whole process be graphical-draw the actual ZOOM BOX on the
screen. Pick two opposite corners, press ENTER, and the box becomes the new
viewing window (Figure 3.12).
The first zoom narrows the search for x*. It lies between x = 1 and x = 3. We build
a new ZOOM BOX and zoom in again. Now 1.5 < x* < 2. Reasonable accuracy
comes quickly. High accuracy does not come quickly. It takes time to create the box
and execute the zoom.
Question 1 What happens as we zoom in, if all boxes are square (equal scaling)?
Answer The picture gets flatter and flatter. We are zooming in to the tangent line.
Changing x to X/4 and y to Y/4, the parabola y = x2 flattens to Y = X2/4. To see
any bending, we must use a long thin zoom box.

I want to change to a totally different approach. Suppose we have a formula for
dyldx. That derivative was produced by an infinite zoom! The limit of Ay/Ax came by
brainpower alone:
dy =

Call this f(x).

This function is zero at x*. The computing problem is completely changed: Solve
Ax) = 0. It is easier to find a root of f(x) than a minimum of y(x). The graph of f(x)
crosses the x axis. The graph of y(x) goes flat-this is harder to pinpoint.
Take the model function y = x2 for 1x1 c .0 1. The slope f = 2x changes from -.02
to .02. The value of x2 moves only by .0001-its minimum point is hard to see.
To repeat: Minimization is easier with dyldx. The screen shows an order of magnitude improvement, when we trace or zoom on f(x) = 0. In calculus, we have been
taking the derivative for granted. It is natural to get blask about dyldx = 0. We forget
how intelligent it is, to work with the slope instead of the function.

+

Question 2 How do you get another order of magnitude improvement?
Answer Use the next derivative! With a formula for dfldx, which is dZy/dx2,the
convergence is even faster. In two steps the error goes from .O1 to .0001 to .00000001.
Another infinite zoom went into the formula for dfldx, and Newton's method takes
account of it. Sections 3.6 and 3.7 study f(x) = 0.

THE CENTERING TRANSFORM AND ZOOM TRANSFORM

For a photograph we do two things-point the right way and stand at the right
distance. Then take the picture. Those steps are the same for a graph. First we pick
the new center point. The graph is shifted, to move that point from (a, b) to (0,O).
Then we decide how far the graph should reach. It fits in a rectangle, just like the
photograph. Rescaling to x/c and y/d puts the desired section of the curve into the
rectangle.
A good photographer does more (like an artist). The subjects are placed and the
camera is focused. For good graphs those are necessary too. But an everyday calculator or computer or camera is built to operate without an artist-just aim and shoot.
I want to explain how to aim at y =f(x).
We are doing exactly what a calculator does, with one big difference. It doesn't
change coordinates. We do. When x = 1, y = - 2 moves to the center of the viewing
window, the calculator still shows that point as (1, -2). When the centering transform
acts on y 2 = m(x - I), those numbers disappear. This will be confusing unless x
and y also change. The new coordinates are X = x - 1 and Y = y + 2. Then the new
equation is Y = mX.
The main point (for humans) is to make the algebra simpler. The computer has no
preference for Y = mX over y - yo = m(x - x,). It accepts 2x2 - 4x as easily as x2.
But we do prefer Y = mX and y = x2, partly because their graphs go through (0,O).
Ever since zero was invented, mathematicians have liked that number best.

+

EXAMPLE 4 The parabola y = 2x2- 4x has its minimum when dyldx = 4x - 4 = 0.
Thus x = 1 and y = - 2. Move this bottom point to the center: y = 2x2 - 44 is

The new parabola Y = 2X2 has its bottom at (0,O). It is the same curve, shifted across
and up. The only simpler parabola is y = x2. This final step is the job of the zoom.
Next comes scaling. We may want more detail (zoom in to see the tangent line).
We may want a big picture (zoom out to check asymptotes). We might stretch one
axis more than the other, if the picture looks like a pancake or a skyscraper.

~ . number 2 disappears if c = d = 2. With
coordinates, the equation is y/c = ~ ( x / c )The
the right centering and the right zoom, every parabola that opens upward is y = x2.
Question 3 What happens to the derivatives (slope and bending) after a zoom?
Answer The slope (first derivative) is multiplied by d/c. Apply the chain rule to y =

dF(x/c). A square zoom has d/c = 1-lines keep their slope. The second derivative is
multiplied by d/c2, which changes the bending. A zoom out divides by small numbers
c = d, so the big picture is more, curved.
Combining the centering and zoom transforms, as we do in practice, gives y in
terms of x:
y =f(x) becomes Y=f(X+a)-b

[ (: ) - bl.

andthen y = d f - + a

Fig. 3.14 Change of coordinates by centering and zoom. Calculators still show (x, y).

Question 4 Find x and y ranges after two transforms. Start between - 1 and 1.
Answer The window after centering is - 1 < x - a < 1 and - 1 < y - b < 1. The
window after zoom is - 1 < c(x - a) < 1 and - 1 < d(y - b) < 1. The point (1, 1) was
originally in the corner. The point (c-'

+ a, d + b) is now in the corner.

The numbers a, b, c, d are chosen to produce a simpler function (like y = x2). Or
else-this is important in applied mathematics-they are chosen to make x and y
"dimensionless." An example is y = f cos 8t. The frequency 8 has dimension l/time.
The amplitude f is a distance. With d = 2 cm and c = 8 sec, the units are removed
and y = cos t.
May I mention one transform that does change the slope? It is a rotation. The
whole plane is turned. A photographer might use it-but normally people are supposed to be upright. You use rotation when you turn a map or straighten a picture.
In the next section, an unrecognizable hyperbola is turned into Y = 1/X.

Here is a list of the most important curves in mathematics, so you can tell what is
coming. It is not easy to rank the top four:
1. straight lines
2. sines and cosines (oscillation)
3. exponentials (growth and decay)
4. parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas (using 1, x, y, x2, xy, y2).
The curves that I wrote last, the Greeks would have written first. It is so natural to
go from linear equations to quadratic equations. Straight lines use 1,x, y. Second
degree curves include x2, xy, y2. If we go on to x3 and y3, the mathematics gets
complicated. We now study equations of second degree, and the curves they produce.
It is quite important to see both the equations and the curves. This section connects
two great parts of mathematics-analysis of the equation and geometry of the curve.
Together they produce "analytic geometry." You already know about functions and
graphs. Even more basic: Numbers correspond to points. We speak about "the point
(5,2)." Euclid might not have understood.
Where Euclid drew a 45" line through the origin, Descartes wrote down y = x.
Analytic geometry has become central to mathematics-we now look at one part of it.

Fig. 3.15 The cutting plane gets steeper: circle to ellipse to parabola to hyperbola.

3 Appllcatlonr of the Derhrathre
CONIC SECTIONS

The parabola and ellipse and hyperbola have absolutely remarkable properties. The
Greeks discovered that all these curves come from slicing a cone by a plane. The
curves are "conic sections." A level cut gives a circle, and a moderate angle produces
an ellipse. A steep cut gives the two pieces of a hyperbola (Figure 3.15d). At the
borderline, when the slicing angle matches the cone angle, the plane carves out a
parabola. It has one branch like an ellipse, but it opens to infinity like a hyperbola.
Throughout mathematics, parabolas are on the border between ellipses and
hyperbolas.
To repeat: We can slice through cones or we can look for equations. For a cone
of light, we see an ellipse on the wall. (The wall cuts into the light cone.) For an
equation AX^ + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0, we will work to make it simpler. The
graph will be centered and rescaled (and rotated if necessary), aiming for an equation
like y = x2. Eccentricity and polar coordinates are left for Chapter 9.
THE PARABOLA y = m2+ bx

+c

You knew this function long before calculus. The graph crosses the x axis when
y = 0. The quadratic formula solves y = 3x2 - 4x + 1 = 0, and so does factoring into
(x - 1)(3x - 1). The crossing points x = 1 and x = f come from algebra.
The other important point is found by calculus. It is the minimum point, where
dyldx = 6x - 4 = 0. The x coordinate is 8 = f , halfway between the crossing points.
This is the vertex V in Figure 3.16a-at the bottom of the

parabola.
A parabola has no asymptotes. The slope 6x - 4 doesn't approach a constant.

To center the vertex Shift left by 3 and up by f . So introduce the new variables
and Y = y + f . hen x = f and y = - 3 correspond to X = Y=O-which
is the new vertex:
y = 3x2- 4x + 1 becomes Y = 3X 2.

x=x-$

+

Check the algebra. Y = 3X2 is the same as y f = 3(x - 3)2. That simplifies to the
original equation y = 3x2- 4x + 1. The second graph shows the centered parabola
Y = 3X2, with the vertex moved to the origin.

To zoom in on the vertex Rescale X and Y by the zoom factor a:

Y = 3 x 2 becomes y/a = 3 ( ~ / a ) ~ .
The final equation has x and y in boldface. With a = 3 we find y = x2-the graph is
magnified by 3. In two steps we have reached the model parabola opening upward.

I directrix at y = - 4
Fig. 3.16 Parabola with minimum at V. Rays reflect to focus. Centered in (b), rescaled in (c).

3.5 Parabolas, Ellipses, and Hyperbolas

A parabola has another important point-the focus. Its distance from the vertex
is called p. The special parabola y = x2 has p = 114, and other parabolas Y = a x 2
have p = 1/4a. You magnify by a factor a to get y = x2. The beautiful property of a
parabola is that every ray coming straight down is reflected to the focus.
Problem 2.3.25 located the focus F-here we mention two applications. A solar
collector and a TV dish are parabolic. They concentrate sun rays and TV signals
onto a point-a heat cell or a receiver collects them at the focus. The 1982 UMAP
Journal explains how radar and sonar use the same idea. Car headlights turn the
idea around, and send the light outward.
Here is a classical fact about parabolas. From each point on the curve, the distance
to the focus equals the distance to the "directrix." The directrix is the line y = - p
below the vertex (so the vertex is halfway between focus and directrix). With p = 4,
the distance down from any (x, y) is y + 4. Match that with the distance to the focus
at (0,a)- this is the square root below. Out comes the special parabola y = x2:
y +4 =

-

(square both sides)

-

y = x2.

(2)

The exercises give practice with all the steps we have taken-center the parabola to
Y = a x 2 , rescale it to y = x2, locate the vertex and focus and directrix.
Summary for other parabolas y = ax2 + bx + c has its vertex where dy/dx is zero.
Thus 2ax + b = 0 and x = - b/2a. Shifting across to that point is "completing the
square":

(

ax2 + bx + e equals a x + :l)i

+ C.

Here C = c - (b2/4a)is the height of the vertex. The centering transform X = x + (b/2a),
Y = y - C produces Y = a x 2 . It moves the vertex to (0, 0), where it belongs.
For the ellipse and hyperbola, our plan of attack is the same:

1. Center the curve to remove any linear terms Dx and Ey.
2. Locate each focus and discover the reflection property.
3. Rotate to remove Bxy if the equation contains it.
x2 y2
ELLIPSES - + - = 1 (CIRCLES HAVE a= b )
a 2 b2

This equation makes the ellipse symmetric about (0, 0)-the center. Changing x to
-x or y to -y leaves the same equation. No extra centering or rotation is needed.
The equation also shows that x2/a2 and y2/b2 cannot exceed one. (They add to
one and can't be negative.) Therefore x2 < a2,and x stays between - a and a. Similarly
y stays between b and - b. The ellipse is inside a rectangle.
By solving for y we get a function (or two functions!) of x:

The graphs are the top half (+) and bottom half (-) of the ellipse. To draw the ellipse,
plot them together. They meet when y = 0, at x = a on the far right of Figure 3.17
and at x = - a on the far left. The maximum y = b and minimum y = - b are at the
top and bottom of the ellipse, where we bump into the enclosing rectangle.
A circle is a special case of an ellipse, when a = b. The circle equation x2 + y2 = r2
is the ellipse equation with a = b = r. This circle is centered at (0,O); other circles are

3 Applications of the Derivative

centered at x = h, y = k. The circle is determined by its radius r and its center (h, k):
Equation of circle: (x - h)'

+ (y - k)2 = r2.

(4)
In words, the distance from (x, y) on the circle to (h, k) at the center is r. The
equation has linear terms - 2hx and - 2ky-they disappear when the center is (0,O).
EXAMPLE 1

Find the circle that has a diameter from (1,7) to (5, 7).

Solution The center is halfway at (3,7). So r = 2 and (x - 3)2+ (y - 7)2= 22.
EXAMPLE2

Find the center and radius of the circle x2 - 6x + y2 - 14y = - 54.

Solution Complete x2 - 6x to the square (x - 3)2 by adding 9. Complete y2 - 14y
to (y - 7)2 by adding 49. Adding 9 and 49 to both sides of the equation leaves
(x - 3)2 (y - 7)2= 4-the same circle as in Example 1.

+

Quicker Solution Match the given equation with (4). Then h = 3, k = 7, and r = 2:

x2 - 6x + y2 - 14y = - 54 must agree with x2 - 2hx + h2 + y2 - 2ky + k2 = r2.
The change to X = x - h and Y= y - k moves the center of the circle from (h, k)
to (0,O). This is equally true for an ellipse:

x2 y 2 1.

When we rescale by x = Xja and y = Ylb, we get the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1.

The unit circle has area n. The ellipse has area nab (proved later in the book). The
distance around the circle is 2n. The distance around an ellipse does not rescale-it
has no simple formula.

Fig. 3.17

Uncentered circle. Centered ellipse ~ ~ + y12 / 2 23= 1 ~. The distance from center to
far right is also a = 3. All rays from F 2 reflect to F , .

Now we leave circles and concentrate on ellipses. They have two foci (pronounced
fo-sigh). For a parabola, the second focus is at infinity. For a circle, both foci are at
the center. The foci of an ellipse are on its longer axis (its major axis), one focus on
each side of the center:
~ , i s a t x = e = J a ~ - b ~ and

F2isatx=-c.

The right triangle in Figure 3.17 has sides a, b, c. From the top of the ellipse, the
distance to each focus is a. From the endpoint at x = a, the distances to the foci are
a + c and a - c. Adding (a + c) + (a - c) gives 2a. As you go around the ellipse, the
distance to F , plus the distance to F2 is constant (always 2a).

3.5 Parabolas, Ellipses, and Hyperbolas

is another equation for the ellipse:

2a.

(5)

To draw an ellipse, tie a string of length 2a to the foci. Keep the string taut and your
moving pencil will create the ellipse. This description uses a and c-the other form
uses a and b (remember b2 + c 2 = a2 ). Problem 24 asks you to simplify equation (5)
until you reach x 2/a2 + y 2/b 2 = 1.
The "whispering gallery" of the United States Senate is an ellipse. If you stand at
one focus and speak quietly, you can be heard at the other focus (and nowhere else).
Your voice is reflected off the walls to the other focus-following the path of the
string. For a parabola the rays come in to the focus from infinity-where the second
focus is.
A hospital uses this reflection property to split up kidney stones. The patient sits
inside an ellipse with the kidney stone at one focus. At the other focus a lithotripter
sends out hundreds of small shocks. You get a spinal anesthetic (I mean the patient)
and the stones break into tiny pieces.
The most important focus is the Sun. The ellipse is the orbit of the Earth. See
Section 12.4 for a terrible printing mistake by the Royal Mint, on England's last
pound note. They put the Sun at the center.
Question 1 Why do the whispers (and shock waves) arrive together at the second
focus?
Answer Whichever way they go, the distance is 2a. Exception: straight path is 2c.
Question 2 Locate the ellipse with equation 4x 2 + 9y 2 = 36.

Notice the minus sign for a hyperbola. That makes all the difference. Unlike an ellipse,

x and y can both be large. The curve goes out to infinity. It is still symmetric, since
x can change to - x and y to - y.

The asymptotes are the lines yla = x/b and yla = - x/b. Their slopes are a/b and - a/b.

For a hyperbola, the foci are inside the two branches. Their distance from the

,is larger than a and b. The vertex
center is still called c. But now c = ,/=
is a distance c - a from one focus and c + a from the other. The diflerence (not the
sum) is (c + a) - (c - a) = 2a.
All points on the hyperbola have this property: The diflerence between distances to
the foci is constantly 2a. A ray coming in to one focus is reflected toward the other.
The reflection is on the outside of the hyperbola, and the inside of the ellipse.
Here is an application to navigation. Radio signals leave two fixed transmitters at
the same time. A ship receives the signals a millisecond apart. Where is the ship?
Answer: It is on a hyperbola with foci at the transmitters. Radio signals travel
186 miles in a millisecond, so 186 = 2a. This determines the curve. In Long Range
Navigation (LORAN) a third transmitter gives another hyperbola. Then the ship
is located exactly.
Question 4 How do hyperbolas differ from parabolas, far from the center?
Answer Hyperbolas have asymptotes. Parabolas don't.
The hyperbola has a natural rescaling. The appearance of x/b is a signal to change
to X . Similarly yla becomes Y. Then Y = 1 at the vertex, and we have a standard
hyperbola:
y2/a2- x2/b2= 1 becomes

Y 2 - X 2 = 1.

A 90" turn gives X 2 - y 2 = l-the hyperbola opens to the sides. A 45" turn produces
2X Y = 1. We show below how to recognize x2 + x y + y2 = 1 as an ellipse and
x2 3xy + y2 = 1 as a hyperbola. (They are not circles because of the xy term.) When
the xy coefficient increases past 2, x2 + y2 no longer indicates an ellipse.

THE GENERAL EQUATION Ax2+ Bxy + Cy2 Dx + Ey

+F=0

This equation is of second degree, containing any and all of 1, x, y, x2, xy, y2.
A plane is cutting through a cone. Is the curve a parabola or ellipse or hyperbola?
Start with the most important case Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 = 1.

I

+

+

The equation Ax2 Bxy cyZ= 1 produces a hyperbola if B~ > 4AC and
an ellipse if B2 < 4AC. A parabola has B2 = 4AC.

I

I

To recognize the curve, we remove Bxy by rotating the plane. This also changes A
and C-but the combination B~ - 4AC is not changed (proof omitted). An example
is 2xy = 1, with B~ = 4. It rotates to y2 - x2 = 1, with - 4AC = 4. That positive
number 4 signals a hyperbola-since A = - 1 and C = 1 have opposite signs.
Another example is x2 + y2 = 1. It is a circle (a special ellipse). However we rotate,
the equation stays the same. The combination B~ - 4AC = 0 - 4 1 1 is negative, as
predicted for ellipses.
To rotate by an angle a, change x and y to new variables x' and y':

x = X' cos a - y' sin a
y = x' sin a + y' cos a

x cos a + y sin a
y' = - y sin a + x cos a.
=

and

(7)

+

Substituting for x and y changes AX^ Bxy + c y 2 = 1 to A ' x ' ~+ B'xly' + Cryf2= 1.
The formulas for A', B', C' are painful so I go to the key point:
B' is zero

if the rotation angle a has tan

2a = B/(A - C).

With B' = 0, the curve is easily recognized from A ' x ' ~+ C'yr2= 1. It is a hyperbola
if A' and C' have opposite signs. Then B ' ~ 4A1C' is positive. The original B~ - 4AC
was also positive, because this special combination stays constant during rotation.
After the xy term is gone, we deal with x and y-by centering. To find the center,
complete squares as in Questions 3 and 6. For total perfection, rescale to one of the
model equations y = x2 or x2 + y2 = 1 or y2 - x2 = 1.
The remaining question is about F = 0. What is the graph of AX? + Bxy + c y 2 = O?
The ellipse-hyperbola-parabola have disappeared. But if the Greeks were right, the
cone is still cut by a plane. The degenerate case F = 0 occurs when the plane cuts
right through the sharp point of the cone.
A level cut hits only that one point (0,O). The equation shrinks to x2 + y 2 = 0, a
circle with radius zero. A steep cut gives two lines. The hyperbola becomes y2 -?. x2 = 0,
leaving only its asymptotes y = x. A cut at the exact angle of the cone gives only
one line, as in x2 = 0. A single point, two lines, and one line are very extreme cases of
an ellipse, hyperbola, and parabola.

+

All these "conic sections" come from planes and cones. The beauty of the geometry,
which Archimedes saw, is matched by the importance of the equations. Galileo discovered that projectiles go along parabolas (Chapter 12). Kepler discovered that the
Earth travels on an ellipse (also Chapter 12). Finally Einstein discovered that light
travels on hyperbolas. That is in four dimensions, and not in Chapter 12.

3.6 Iterations X n + 1 = F ( x n )
Iteration means repeating the same function. Suppose the function is F(x) = cos x.
Choose any starting value, say x, = 1. Take its cosine: x, = cos x, = .54. Then take
the cosine of x, . That produces x2 = cos .54 = .86. The iteration is x, + = cos x,. I
am in radian mode on a calculator, pressing "cos" each time. The early numbers are
not important, what is important is the output after 12 or 30 or 100 steps:

,

..., x29 = .7391, ~ 3 =, .7391.
The goal is to explain why the x's approach x* = .739085 ..... Every starting value

EXAMPLE 1 x12 = .75, x13 = .73, x14 = .74,

x, leads to this same number x*. What is special about .7391?
Note on iterations Do x1 = cos x, and x2 = cos x, mean that x, = cos2x,? Absolutely not! Iteration creates a new and different function cos (cos x). It uses the cos
button, not the squaring button. The third step creates F(F(F(x))).As soon as you
can, iterate with x,+, = 4 cos x,. What limit do the x's approach? Is it 3(.7931)?

Let me slow down to understand these questions. The central idea is expressed by
the equation x,+, = F(x,). Substituting xo into F gives x,. This output x, is the input
that leads to x,. In its turn, x2 is the input and out comes x, = F(x2).This is iteration,
and it produces the sequence x,, x,, x2, ....
The x's may approach a limit x*, depending on the function F. Sometimes x* also
depends on the starting value x,. Sometimes there is no limit. Look at a second
example, which does not need a calculator.

,

EXAMPLE 2 x,+ = F(x,) = i x , + 4. Starting from x, = 0 the sequence is
2 . 6 + 4 = 7 9 x 4 = 12 . 7 + 4 = 7 L2, ....
x,=4*0+4=4, x2=i*4+4=6, x3=L

Those numbers 0, 4, 6, 7, 73, . . . seem to be approaching x* = 8. A computer would
convince us. So will mathematics, when we see what is special about 8:
When the x's approach x*, the limit of x, +, = ix, + 4
is X*= I,x * 4. This limiting equation yields x* = 8.

+

8 is the "steady state" where input equals output: 8 = F(8). It is thefixedpoint.
If we start at x, = 8, the sequence is 8, 8, 8, ... . When we start at x, = 12, the
sequence goes back toward 8:

Equation for limit: If the iterations x, +

,= F(x,) converge to x*, then x* = F(x*).

To repeat: 8 is special because it equals 4 8 + 4. The number .7391.. . is special because
it equals cos .7391.. .. The graphs of y = x and y = F(x) intersect at x*. To explain why
the x's converge (or why they don't) is the job of calculus.
EXAMPLE 3 x n + ,= xi has two fixed points: 0 = 0' and 1 = 12. Here F(x) = x2.

a, A,

&,. . . goes quickly to x* = 0. The only
Starting from x, = 3 the sequence
approaches to x* = 1 are from x, = 1 (of course) and from x, = - 1. Starting from
x, = 2 we get 4, 16, 256, . . . and the sequence diverges to + m.
Each limit x* has a "basin of attraction." The basin contains all starting points x,
that lead to x*. For Examples 1 and 2, every x, led to .7391 and 8. The basins were

the whole line (that is still to be proved). Example 3 had three basins-the interval
-1 < x, < 1, the two points xo = 1, and all the rest. The outer basin Ixo(> 1 led
to co. I challenge you to find the limits and the basins of attraction (by calculator)
for F(x) = x - tan x.
In Example 3, x* = 0 is attracting. Points near x* move toward x*. The fixed point
x* = 1 is repelling. Points near 1 move away. We now find the rule that decides
whether x* is attracting or repelling. The key is the slope dF/dx at x*.

+

+

3J Start from any x, near a fixed point x* = F(x*):

x* is attracting if IdF/dxf is below 1 at x*
x* is repelling if

IdFldxl is above 1 at x*.

First I will give a calculus proof. Then comes a picture of convergence, by "cobwebs."
Both methods throw light on this crucial test for attraction: IdF/dxl< 1.
First proof: Subtract x* = F(x*) from x,,, = F(x,). The difference x,,, - x* is
the same as F(x,) - F(x*). This is AF. The basic idea of calculus is that AF is close
to F'Ax:
x,+ - x* = F(x,) - F(x*) z F1(x*)(xn- x*).
(1)

,

The "error" x, - x* is multiplied by the slope dF/dx. The next error x,+ - x* is
smaller or larger, based on I F'I < 1 or I F'I > 1 at x*. Every step multiplies approximately by F1(x*).Its size controls the speed of convergence.
In Example 1, F(x) is cos x and F1(x) is -sin x. There is attraction to .7391
because lsin x* I < 1. In Example 2, F is f x + 4 and F' is i. There is attraction to 8.
In Example 3, F is x2 and F' is 2x. There is superattraction to x* = 0 (where F' = 0).
There is repulsion from x* = 1 (where F' = 2).
I admit one major difficulty. The approximation in equation (1) only holds near
x*. If x, is far away, does the sequence still approach x*? When there are several
attracting points, which x* do we reach? This section starts with good iterations,
which solve the equation x* = F(x*) or f(x) = 0. At the end we discover Newton's
method. The next section produces crazy but wonderful iterations, not converging
and not blowing up. They lead to "fractals" and "Cantor sets" and "chaos."
The mathematics of iterations is not finished. It may never be finished, but we are
converging on the answers. Please choose a function and join in.
THE GRAPH OF AN ITERATION: COBWEBS

,

The iteration x,, = F(x,) involves two graphs at the same time. One is the graph
of y = F(x). The other is the graph of y = x (the 45" line). The iteration jumps back
and forth between these graphs. It is a very convenient way to see the whole process.
Example 1 was x,,, = cos x,. Figure 3.19 shows the graph of cos x and the "cobweb." Starting at (x,, x,) on the 45" line, the rule is based on x, = F(x,):
From (x,, x,) go up or down to (x,, x,) on the curve.
From (x,, x,) go across to (x,, x,) on the 45" line.
These steps are repeated forever. From x, go up to the curve at F(x,). That height
is x, . Now cross to the 45" line at (x,, x,). The iterations are aiming for (x*, x*) =
(.7391, .7391). This is the crossing point of the two graphs y = F(x) and y = x.

3 Applicafions of the Derivative

Fig. 3-49 Cobwebs go from (xo,xo)to (xo,xl) to ( x l ,xl)-line

to curve to line.

Example 2 was xn+,= f xn + 4. Both graphs are straight lines. The cobweb is onesided, from (0,O) to (0,4) to (4,4) to (4,6) to (6,6). Notice how y changes (vertical
line) and then x changes (horizontal line). The slope of F(x) is 4,so the distance to 8
is multiplied by f at every step.
Example 3 was xn+,= xz. The graph of y = x2 crosses the 45" line at two fixed
points: O2 = 0 and l 2 = 1. Figure 3.20a starts the iteration close to 1, but it quickly
goes away. This fixed point is repelling because F'(1) = 2. Distance from x* = 1 is
doubled (at the start). One path moves down to x* = 0-which is superattractive
because F' = 0. The path from x, > 1 diverges to infinity.
EXAMPLE 4

F(x) has two attracting points x* (a repelling x* is always between).

Figure 3.20b shows two crossings with slope zero. The iterations and cobwebs converge quickly. In between, the graph of F(x) must cross the 45" line from below. That
requires a slope greater than one. Cobwebs diverge from this unstable point, which
separates the basins of attraction. The fixed point x = n: is in a basin by itself!
Note 1 To draw cobwebs on a calculator, graph y = F(x) on top of y = x. On a
Casio, one way is to plot (x,, x,) and give the command L I N E : P L 0 T X ,Y
followed by E X E. Now move the cursor vertically to y = F(x) and press E X E. Then
move horizontally to y = x and press E X E. Continue. Each step draws a line.

3.6 Iterations xn+ = F(xn)

For the TI-81 (and also the Casio) a short program produces a cobweb. Store F(x)
in the Y = function slot Y 1 . Set the range (square window or autoscaling). Run the
program and answer the prompt with x,:

Note 2 The x's approach x* from one side when 0 < dF/dx < 1.
Note 3 A basin of attraction can include faraway x,'s (basins can come in infinitely
many pieces). This makes the problem interesting. If no fixed points are attracting,
see Section 3.7 for "cycles" and "chaos."
THE ITERATION xn+,= X, - c~(x,,)

At this point we offer the reader a choice. One possibility is to jump ahead to the
next section on "Newton's Method." That method is an iteration to solve f (x) = 0.
The function F(x) combines x, and f (x,) and f '(x,) into an optimal formula for x,+ .
We will see how quickly Newton's method works (when it works). It is the outstanding
algorithm to solve equations, and it is totally built on tangent approximations.
The other possibility is to understand (through calculus) a whole family of iterations. This family depends on a number c, which is at our disposal. The best choice
of c produces Newton's method. I emphasize that iteration is by no means a new
and peculiar idea. It is a fundamental technique in scientiJic computing.
We start by recognizing that there are many ways to reach f (x*) = 0. (I write x*
for the solution.) A good algorithm may switch to Newton as it gets close. The
iterations use f (x,) to decide on the next point x,,, :

,

Notice how F(x) is constructedfrom f (x)-they are different! We move f to the right
side and multiply by a "preconditioner" c. The choice of c (or c,, if it changes from
step to step) is absolutely critical. The starting guess xo is also important-but its
accuracy is not always under our control.
Suppose the x, converge to x*. Then the limit of equation (2) is
x* = x* - cf (x*).

(3)
That gives f (x*) = 0. If the x,'s have a limit, it solves the right equation. It is a fixed
point of F (we can assume cn+ c # 0 and f (x,) +f (x*)). There are two key questions,
and both of them are answered by the slope Ft(x*):
1. How quickly does x, approach x* (or do the x, diverge)?
2. What is a good choice of c (or c,)?

,

D W P L E 5 f (x) = ax - b is zero at x* = bla. The iteration xn+ = xn- c(ax, - b)
intends to find bla without actually dividing. (Early computers could not divide; they
used iteration.) Subtracting x* from both sides leaves an equation for the error:

x,+~-x*=x,-x*-

c(ax, - b).

Replace b by ax*. The right side is (1 - ca)(x, - x*). This "error equation" is
(error), +

,= (1 - ca)(error),.

(4)

3 Applications of the Derivative

if

At every step the error is multiplied by ( 1 - ca), which is F'. The error goes to zero
IF' I is less than 1. The absolute value ( 1 - cal decides everything:
x, converges to x* if and only if - 1 < 1 - ca < 1.

(5)

The perfect choice (if we knew it) is c = l/a, which turns the multiplier 1 - ca into
zero. Then one iteration gives the exact answer: x , = xo - (l/a)(axo- b) = bla. That
is the horizontal line in Figure 3.21a, converging in one step. But look at the other
lines.
This example did not need calculus. Linear equations never do. The key idea is
that close to x* the nonlinear equation f ( x )= 0 is nearly linear. We apply the tangent
approximation. You are seeing how calculus is used, in a problem that doesn't start
by asking for a derivative.
THE BEST CHOICE OF c

The immediate goal is to study the errors x, - x*. They go quickly to zero, if
the multiplier is small. To understand x,,, = x, - cf (x,), subtract the equation
x* = x* - cf (x*):
x,+ - x* = x, - x* - c(f (x,) -f (x*)).
(6)

,

Now calculus enters. When you see a &Terence off's think of dfldx. Replace
.f(x,) -f ( x * )by A(x, - x*), where A stands for the slope df /dx at x*:
x,+ - x* z ( 1 - cA)(x,- x*).

(7)

This is the error equation. The new error at step n + 1 is approximately the old error
multiplied by m = 1 - cA. This corresponds to m = 1 - ca in the linear example. We
keep returning to the basic test Iml= I Ff(x*)l< 1:

There is only one difficulty: W e don't know x*. Therefore we don't know the perfect
c. It depends on the slope A =f ' ( x * )at the unknown solution. However we can come
close, by using the slope at x,:
Choose c, = l /f '(x,). Then x,+

= x, -f

( x J f '(x,) = F(x,).

This is Newton's method. The multiplier m = 1 - cA is as near to zero as we can make
it. By building dfldx into F(x),Newton speeded up the convergence of the iteration.

The line y = 2x crosses the cosine curve somewhere near x = f. The intersection
point where 2x* = cos x* has no simple formula. We start from xo = f and iterate
x,+ = X, - c(2xn- cos x,) with three diflerent choices of c.

The column with c = 1 is diverging (repelled from x*). The second column shows
convergence (attracted to x*). The third column (Newton's method) approaches x*
so quickly that .4501836 and seven more digits are exact for x3.
How does this convergence match the prediction? Note that f '(x) = 2 + sin x so
A = 2.435. Look to see whether the actual errors x, - x*, going down each column,
are multiplied by the predicted m below that column:

The first column shows a multiplier below - 1. The errors grow at every step. Because
m is negative the errors change sign-the cobweb goes outward.
The second column shows convergence with m = .018. It takes one genuine Newton
step, then c is fixed. After n steps the error is closely proportional to mn= (.018)"that is "linear convergence'' with a good multiplier.
The third column shows the "quadratic convergence" of Newton's method.
Multiplying the error by m is more attractive than ever, because m + 0. In fact m
itself is proportional to the error, so at each step the error is squared. Problem 3.8.31
will show that (error),. < error):. This squaring carries us from
to
to
lo-' to "machine E" in three steps. The number of correct digits is doubled at every
step as Newton converges.

,

Note 1 The choice c = 1 produces x,+, = x, -f (x,). This is "successive substitution." The equation f (x) = 0 is rewritten as x = x -f (x), and each x, is substituted
back to produce x,, . Iteration with c = 1 does not always fail!

,

Note 2 Newton's method is successive substitution for f /f ', not f . Then m x 0.
Note 3 Edwards and Penney happened to choose the same example 2x = cos x. But
they cleverly wrote it as x, + = 4cos x,, which has IF' I = 14 sin XI< 1. This iteration
fits into our family with c = i , and it succeeds. We asked earlier if its limit is $(.7391).
No, it is x* = .45O....

,

3 Applications of the Derivative
Note 4 The choice c = l /f ' ( x o )is "modified Newton." After one step of Newton's
method, c is fixed. The steps are quicker, because they don't require a new ff(x,).
But we need more steps. Millions of dollars are spent on Newton's method, so speed
is important. In all its forms, f ( x )= 0 is the central problem of computing.

3.7 Newton's Method (and Chaos)
The equation to be solved is f (x) = 0. Its solution x* is the point where the graph
crosses the x axis. Figure 3.22 shows x* and a starting guess x,. Our goal is to come
as close as possible to x*, based on the information f (x,) and f '(xo).
Section 3.6 reached Newton's formula for x, (the next guess). We now do that directly.
What do we see at x,? The graph has height f (xo) and slope ft(x0). We know
where we are, and which direction the curve is going. We don't know if the curve
bends (we don't have f "). The best plan is to follow the tangent line, which uses all
the information we have.
Newton replaces f (x) by its linear approximation (= tangent approximation):
We want the left side to be zero. The best we can do is to make the right side zero!
The tangent line crosses the axis at x,, while the curve crosses at x*. The new guess
x, comes from f (x,) +f '(xo)(xl - x,) = 0.Dividing by f '(xo) and solving for x, ,this
is step 1 of Newton's method:

At this new point, compute f (x, ) and f'(x, )-the height and slope at x, . They
give a new tangent line, which crosses at x2. At every step we want f (x, + ) = 0 and
we settle for f (x,) +f '(x,)(x,+ - x,) = 0.After dividing by f '(x,), the formula for
x, + is Newton's method.

Linear approximation involves three numbers. They are Ax (across) and Af (up)
and the slope f'(x). If we know two of those numbers, we can estimate the third. It
is remarkable to realize that calculus has now used all three calculations--they are

the key to this subject:
(Section 2.1)
(Section 3.1)
(Newton's method)

1. Estimate the slope f'(x) from Af/Ax
2. Estimate the change Af from f'(x) Ax
3. Estimate the change Ax from Af/f'(x)

The desired Af is -f(x,). Formula (3) is exactly Ax = -f(x,)/f'(x,).
EXAMPLE 1 (Square roots) f(x)= x 2 - b is zero at x* = b and also at b.
Newton's method is a quick way to find square roots-probably built into your
calculator. The slope is f'(x,) = 2x,, and formula (3) for the new guess becomes
Xn + 1 = Xn --

This simplifies to x, +1 = ½(x, + b/x,). Guess the square root, divide into b, and average
the two numbers. The ancient Babylonians had this same idea, without knowing
functions or slopes. They iterated xn. = F(x,):
F(x) =

x+ -

x

and

F'(x) =

The Babylonians did exactly the right thing. The slope F' is zero at the solution, when
x 2 = b. That makes Newton's method converge at high speed. The convergence test
is IF'(x*)I < 1. Newton achieves F'(x*)= 0-which is superconvergence.

never cross the axis.

That
is the other x*. Often it is difficult to predict which x* Newton's method will choose.
Around every solution is a "basin of attraction," but other parts of the basin may be
far away. Numerical experiments are needed, with many starts x,. Finding basins of
attraction was one of the problems that led to fractals.

EXAMPLE 2 Solve - - a = 0 to find x* = - without dividing by a.

Here f (x) = (llx) - a. Newton uses f '(x) = - 1/x2. Surprisingly, we don't divide:

Do these iterations converge? I will take a = 2 and aim for x* = f.Subtracting 4from
both sides of (7) changes the iteration into the error equation:
X ~ + ~ = ~ X . - becomes
~ X ~

~~+,-i=-2(x.-i)~.

(8)

At each step the error is squared. This is terrific if (and only if) you are close to
x* = ). Otherwise squaring a large error and multiplying by - 2 is not good:

The algebra in Problem 18 confirrhs those experiments. There is fast convergence if
0 < xo < 1. There is divergence if x, is negative or xo > 1. The tangent line goes to a
negative x, . After that Figure 3.22 shows a long trip backwards.
In the previous section we drew F(x). The iteration xn+,= F(xn)converged to the
45" line, where x* = F(x*). In this section we are drawing f (x). Now x* is the point
on the axis where f (x*) = 0.
To repeat: It is f(x*) = 0 that we aim for. But it is the slope Ff(x*)that decides
whether we get there. Example 2 has F(x) = 2x - 2x2. The fixed points are x* = f
(our solution) and x* = 0 (not attractive). The slopes F' (x*) are zero (typical Newton)
and 2 (typical repeller). The key to Newton's method is Ff= 0 at the solution:
The slope of F(x) = x - - is
f '(x)

"(x). Then Ff(x)= 0 when f (x) = 0.

3 Applications of the Derfvative

The examples x2 = b and l/x = a show fast convergence or failure. In Chapter 13,
and in reality, Newton's method solves much harder equations. Here I am going to
choose a third example that came from pure curiosity about what might happen. The
results are absolutely amazing. The equation is x2 = - 1.
EXAMPLE 3

What happens to Newton's method ifyou ask it to solvef (x) = x2 + 1 = O?

The only solutions are the imaginary numbers x* = i and x* = - i. There is no real
square root of -1. Newton's method might as well give up. But it has no way to
know that! The tangent line still crosses the axis at a new point x,,, , even if the
curve y = x2 + 1 never crosses. Equation (5) still gives the iteration for b = - 1:

The x's cannot approach i or - i (nothing is imaginary). So what do they do?
The starting guess xo = 1 is interesting. It is followed by x, = 0. Then x2 divides
by zero and blows up. I expected other sequences to go to infinity. But the experiments
showed something different (and mystifying). When x, is large, x,,, is less than half
as large. After x, = 10 comes x,, = i(10 - &)= 4.95. After much indecision and a
long wait, a number near zero eventually appears. Then the next guess divides by
that small number and goes far out again. This reminded me of "chaos."
It is tempting to retreat to ordinary examples, where Newton's method is a big
success. By trying exercises from the book or equations of your own, you will see
that the fast convergence to $ is very typical. The function can be much more
complicated than x2 - 4 (in practice it certainly is). The iteration for 2x = cos x was
in the previous section, and the error was squared at every step. If Newton's method
starts close to x*, its convergence is overwhelming. That has to be the main point of
this section: Follow the tangent line.
Instead of those good functions, may I stay with this strange example x2 1 = O?
It is not so predictable, and maybe not so important, but somehow it is more interesting. There is no real solution x*, and Newton's method x,,, = +(x, - llx,) bounces
around. We will now discover x,.

,

A FORMULA FOR x,

The key is an exercise from trigonometry books. Most of those problems just give
practice with sines and cosines, but this one exactly fits +(x, - llx,):

In the left equation, the common denominator is 2 sin 8 cos 8 (which is sin 28). The
numerator is cos2 0 - sin2 8 (which is cos 28). Replace cosinelsine by cotangent,
and the identity says this:
If xo = cot 8 then x,

= cot

28.

Then x2 = cot 48.

Then x,

= cot

2" 8.

This is the formula. Our points are on the cotangent curve. Figure 3.23 starts from
xo = 2 = cot 8, and every iteration doubles the angle.
Example A The sequence xo = 1, x, = 0, x2 = m matches the cotangents of ;n/4,;n/2,
and n. This sequence blows up because x, has a division by xl = 0.

Example B The sequence I/&, -1
I /& matches the cotangents of n/3,2n/3,
and 4~13.This sequence cycles forever because xo = x2 = x, = ....
Example C Start with a large xo (a small 8). Then x, is about half as large (at 20).
Eventually one of the angles 4 8,8 8, ... hits on a large cotangent, and the x's go far
out again. This is typical. Examples A and B were special, when 8/n was or 3.
What we have here is chaos. The x's can't converge. They are strongly repelled by
all points. They are also extremely sensitive to the value of 8. After ten steps 0 is
multiplied by 2'' = 1024. The starting angles 60" and 61" look close, but now they
are different by 1024". If that were a multiple of 18W, the cotangents would still be
close. In fact the xlo's are 0.6 and 14.
This chaos in mathematics is also seen in nature. The most familiar example is the
weather, which is much more delicate than you might think. The headline "Forecasting Pushed Too Far" appeared in Science (1989). The article said that the snowballing of small errors destroys the forecast after six days. We can't follow the weather
equations for a month-the flight of a plane can change everything. This is a revolutionary idea, that a simple rule can lead to answers that are too sensitive to compute.
We are accustomed to complicated formulas (or no formulas). We are not
accustomed to innocent-looking formulas like cot 2" 8, which are absolutely hopeless
after 100 steps.
CHAOS FROM A PARABOLA

,

Now I get to tell you about new mathematics. First I will change the iteration x,+ =
4(xn- llx,) into one that is even simpler. By switching from x to z = l/(l x2), each
new z turns out to involve only the old z and z2:

This is the most famous quadratic iteration in the world. There are books about it,
and Problem 28 shows where it comes from. Our formula for x, leads to z,:

3 Applicaiions of the DerhrcrHve

The sine is just as unpredictable as the cotangent, when 2"8gets large. The new thing
is to locate this quadratic as the last member (when a = 4) of the family

Example 2 happened to be the middle member a = 2, converging to ). I would like
to give a brief and very optional report on this iteration, for different a's.
.The general principle is to start with a number zo between 0 and 1, and compute
z, ,z2, z3, .... It is fascinating to watch the behavior change as a increases. You can
see it on your own computer. Here we describe some things to look for. All numbers
stay between 0 and 1 and they may approach a limit. That happens when a is small:
for 0 < a < 1 the z, approach z* = 0
for 1 < a < 3 the z, approach z* = (a - l)/a
Those limit points are the solutions of z = F(z). They are the fixed points where
z* = az* - a(z*)'. But remember the test for approaching a limit: The slope at z*
cannot be larger than one. Here F = az - az2 has F' = a - 2az. It is easy to check
IF'I < 1 at the limits predicted above. The hard problem-sometimes impossibleis to predict what happens above a = 3. Our case is a = 4.
The z's cannot approach a limit when IFt(z*)l> 1. Something has to happen, and
there are at least three possibilities:
The z,'s can cycle or Jill the whole interval (0,l) or approach a Cantor set.
I start with a random number zo, take 100 steps, and write down steps 101 to 105:

The first column is converging to a "2-cycle." It alternates between x = 342 and
y = .452. Those satisfy y = F(x) and x = F(y) = F(F(x)). If we look at a double step
when a = 3.4, x and y are fixed points of the double iteration z , + ~= F(F(z,)). When
a increases past 3.45, this cycle becomes unstable.
At that point the period doublesfrom 2 to 4. With a = 3.5 you see a "4-cycle" in
the table-it repeats after four steps. The sequence bounces from 375 to .383 to 327
to SO1 and back to 375. This cycle must be attractive or we would not see it. But it
also becomes unstable as a increases. Next comes an 8-cycle, which is stable in a little
window (you could compute it) around a = 3.55. The cycles are stable for shorter and
shorter intervals of a's. Those stability windows are reduced by the Feigenbaum shrinking factor 4.6692.. .. Cycles of length 16 and 32 and 64 can be seen in physical
experiments, but they are all unstable before a = 3.57. What happens then?
The new and unexpected behavior is between 3.57 and 4. Down each line of
Figure 3.24, the computer has plotted the values of zlool to z2000-omitting the first
thousand points to let a stable period (or chaos) become established. No points
appeared in the big white wedge. I don't know why. In the window for period 3, you

see only three 2's. Period 3 is followed by 6, 12,24, .... There is period doubling at the
end of every window (including all the windows that are too small to see). You can
reproduce this figure by iterating zn+ = azn- azz from any zo and plotting the results.

,

CANTOR SETS AND FRACIALS

I can't tell what happens at a = 3.8. There may be a stable cycle of some long period.
The z's may come close to every point between 0 and 1. A third possibility is to
approach a very thin limit set, which looks like the famous Cantor set:
To construct the Cantor set, divide [O,l] into three pieces and remove the open
interval (4,3). Then remove (&, 5) and (&#) from what remains. At each step
take out the middle thirds. The points that are left form the Cantor set.
All the endpoints 3, f, 6, 4, ... are in the set. So is $ (Problem 42). Nevertheless the
lengths of the removed intervals add to 1 and the Cantor set has "measure zero."
What is especially striking is its self-similarity: Between 0 and you see the same
Cantor set three times smaller. From 0 to 6 the Cantor set is there again, scaled down
by 9. Every section, when blown up, copies the larger picture. .

Fractals That self-similarity is typical of a fractal. There is an infinite sequence of
scales. A mathematical snowflake starts with a triangle and adds a bump in the
middle of each side. At every step the bumps lengthen the sides by 413. The final
boundary is self-similar, like an infinitely long coastline.
The word "fractal" comes from fractional dimension. The snowflake boundary has
dimension larger than 1 and smaller than 2. The Cantor set has dimension larger
than 0 and smaller than 1. Covering an ordinary line segment with circles of radius
r would take clr circles. For fractals it takes c/rD circles-and D is the dimension.

Our iteration zn+ = 42, - 42: has a = 4, at the end of Figure 3.24. The sequence
z,, z,, ... goes everywhere and nowhere. Its behavior is chaotic, and statistical tests
find no pattern. For all practical purposes the numbers are random.
Think what this means in an experiment (or the stock market). If simple rules
produce chaos, there is absolutely no way to predict the results. No measurement can
ever be sufficiently accurate. The newspapers report that Pluto's orbit is chaoticeven though it obeys the law of gravity. The motion is totally unpredictable over
long times. I don't know what that does for astronomy (or astrology).
The most readable book on this subject is Gleick's best-seller Chaos: Making a
New Science. The most dazzling books are The Beauty of Fractals and The Science
of Fractal Images, in which Peitgen and Richter and Saupe show photographs that
have been in art museums around the world. The most original books are Mandelbrot's Fractals and Fractal Geometry. Our cover has a fractal from Figure 13.11.
We return to friendlier problems in which calculus is not helpless.
NEWTON'S METHOD VS. SECANT METHOD: CALCULATOR PROGRAMS

The hard part of Newton's method is to find df ldx. We need it for the slope of the
tangent line. But calculus can approximate by AflAx-using
the values of f(x)
already computed at x, and x, - .
The secant method follows the secant line instead of the tangent line:

The secant line connects the two latest points on the graph of f(x). Its equation is
y -f (x,) = (Af /Ax)(x - x,). Set y = 0 to find equation (13) for the new x = xn+ ,
where the line crosses the axis.
Prediction: Three secant steps are about as good as two Newton steps. Both should

the secant

3.8 The Mean Value Theorem and IgH6pital'sRule
Now comes one of the cornerstones of calculus: the Mean Value Theorem. It connects
the local pictu.e (slope at a point) to the global picture (average slope across an
interval). In other words it relates df / d x to Af / A x . Calculus depends on this connec-

tion, which we saw first for velocities. If the average velocity is 75, is there a moment
when the instantaneous velocity is 75?
Without more information, the answer to that question is no. The velocity could
be 100 and then 50-averaging 75 but never equal to 75. If we allow a jump in
velocity, it can jump right over its average. At that moment the velocity does not
exist. (The distance function in Figure 3.26a has no derivative at x = 1.) We will take
away this cheap escape by requiring a derivative at all points inside the interval.
In Figure 3.26b the distance increases by 150 when t increases by 2. There is a
derivative df/dt at all interior points (but an infinite slope at t = 0). The average
velocity is
Af _ f(2) -f(0)

75.
At
2-0

The conclusion of the theorem is that df/dt = 75 at some point inside the interval.
There is at least one point where f'(c) = 75.

This is not a constructive theorem. The value of c is not known. We don't find c,
we just claim (with proof) that such a point exists.
3M Mean Value Theorem Suppose f(x) is continuous in the closed interval
a < x < b and has a derivative everywhere in the open interval a < x < b. Then
at
;f(b) -f(a)
f::
-

'(c) at some point a<c<b.(1)

The left side is the average slope Af/Ax. It equals df/dx at c. The notation for a
closed interval [with endpoints] is [a, b]. For an open interval (without endpoints)
we write (a, b). Thus f' is defined in (a, b), and f remains continuous at a and b. A
derivative is allowed at those endpoints too-but the theorem doesn't require it.
The proof is based on a special case-when f(a) = 0 and f(b) = 0. Suppose the
function starts at zero and returns to zero. The average slope or velocity is zero. We

have to prove that f'(c)= 0 at a point in between. This special case (keeping the
assumptions on f(x)) is called Rolle's theorem.

Geometrically, if f goes away from zero and comes back, then f' = 0 at the turn.
3N Rolle's theorem Suppose f(a) =f(b)= 0 (zero at the ends). Then f'(c) =0
at some point with a < c < b.
Proof At a point inside the interval where f(x) reaches its maximum or minimum,
df/dx must be zero. That is an acceptable point c. Figure 3.27a shows the difference
between f= 0 (assumed at a and b) and f' = 0 (proved at c).

3 Applications of the Derivative

Small problem: The maximum could be reached at the ends a and b, iff (x) < 0 in
between. At those endpoints dfldx might not be zero. But in that case the minimum
is reached at an interior point c, which is equally acceptable. The key to our proof
is that a continuous function on [a, b] reaches its maximum and minimum. This is the
Extreme Value Theorem.?
It is ironic that Rolle himself did not believe the logic behind calculus. He may not
have believed his own theorem! Probably he didn't know what it meant-the language of "evanescent quantities" (Newton) and "infinitesimals" (Leibniz)was exciting
but frustrating. Limits were close but never reached. Curves had infinitely many flat
sides. Rolle didn't accept that reasoning, and what was really serious, he didn't accept
the conclusions. The Acadkmie des Sciences had to stop his battles (he fought against
ordinary mathematicians, not Newton and Leibniz). So he went back to number
theory, but his special case when f (a) =f (b) = 0 leads directly to the big one.

Rolle's theorem is when f(a) =f(b) = 0 in the Mean Value Theorem.

Proof of the Mean Value Theorem We are looking for a point where dfldx equals
AflAx. The idea is to tilt the graph back to Rolle's special case (when Af was zero).
In Figure 3.27b, the distance F(x) between the curve and the dotted secant line comes
from subtraction:

At a and b, this distance is F(a) = F(b) = 0. Rolle's theorem applies to F(x). There is
an interior point where Ff(c)= 0. At that point take the derivative of equation (2):
0 =f '(c) - (Af /Ax). The desired point c is found, proving the theorem.

EXAMPLE 1 The function f (x) =
goes from zero at x = 0 to ten at x = 100. Its
average slope is Af/Ax = 10/100. The derivative ff(x)= 1 / 2 6 exists in the open
interval (0, loo), even though it blows up at the end x = 0. By the Mean Value
Theorem there must be a point where 10/100 =f '(c) = 1/2& That point is c = 25.
The truth is that nobody cares about the exact value of c. Its existence is what
matters. Notice how it affects the linear approximation f (x) zf (a) f ' (a)(x - a),
which was basic to this chapter. Close becomes exact ( z becomes = ) when f ' is
computed at c instead of a:

+

?If f ( x ) doesn't reach its maximum M, then 1/(M-f ( x ) ) would be continuous but also
approach infinity. Essential fact: A continuousfunction on [a, b] cannot approach infinity.

3.8 The Mean Value Theorem and l'H6pital's Rule

EXAMPLE 2 The function f(x)= sin x starts from f(0)= 0. The linear prediction
(tangent line) uses the slope cos 0 = 1. The exact prediction uses the slope cos c at an
unknown point between 0 and x:
(approximate)sin x

e

x

(exact) sin x = (cos c)x.

(4)

The approximation is useful, because everything is computed at x = a = 0. The exact
formula is interesting, because cos c < 1 proves again that sin x < x. The slope is
below 1, so the sine graph stays below the 450 line.
EXAMPLE 3

If f'(c) = 0 at allpoints in an interval then f(x) is constant.

Proof When f' is everywhere zero, the theorem gives Af= 0. Every pair of points
has f(b) =f(a). The graph is a horizontal line. That deceptively simple case is a key
to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Most applications of Af=f'(c)Ax do not end up with a number. They end up with
another theorem (like this one). The goal is to connect derivatives (local) to differences
(global). But the next application-l'HOpital'sRule-manages to produce a number
out of 0/0.

at x = 0.

Since 0/0 is meaningless, we cannot work separately with f(x) and g(x). This is a
"race toward zero," in which two functions become small while their ratio might do
anything. The problem is to find the limit of f(x)/g(x).
One such limit is already studied. It is the derivative! Af/Ax automatically builds
in a race toward zero, whose limit is df/dx:
f(x) -f(a) 0
x - a-- 0

but

lim f(-f(a)f'(a).
x--a x-a

(5)

The idea of I'H6pital is to use f'/g' to handle f/g. The derivative is the special case
g(x) = x - a, with g' = 1. The Rule is followed by examples and proofs.

This is not the quotient rule! The derivatives of f(x) and g(x) are taken separately.
Geometrically, I'H6pital is saying that when functions go to zero their slopes control
their size. An easy case is f= 6(x - a) and g = 2(x - a). The ratio f/g is exactly 6/2,

the ratio of their slopes. Figure 3.28 shows these straight lines dropping to zero,
controlled by 6 and 2.
The next figure shows the same limit 612, when the curves are tangent to the lines.
That picture is the key to 1'Hdpital's rule.
Generally the limit off /g can be a finite number L or + oo or - oo.(Also the limit
point x = a can represent a finite number or + oo or - oo. We keep it finite.) The
one absolute requirement is that f (x) and g(x) must separately approach zero-we
insist on 010. Otherwise there is no reason why equation (6) should be true. With
f (x) = x and g(x) = x - 1, don't use l'H6pital:

Ordinary ratios approach lim f (x) divided by lim g(x). lYH6pitalenters only for 010.

The reason behind l'H6pital's Rule is that the following fractions are the same:

That is just algebra; the limit hasn't happened yet. The factors x - a cancel, and the
numbers f (a) and g(a) are zero by assumption. Now take the limit on the right side
of (7) as x approaches a.
What normally happens is that one part approaches f ' at x = a. The other part
approaches g'(a). We hope gl(a) is not zero. In this case we can divide one limit by

3.8 The Mean Value Theorem and l'H8pltal's Rule

the other limit. That gives the "normal" answer
lim f(x)
(x) = limit of (7)- f'(a)

g'(a)

This is also l'H6pital's answer. When f'(x) -+f'(a) and separately g'(x) - g'(a), his
overall limit is f'(a)/g'(a). He published this rule in the first textbook ever written on
differential calculus. (That was in 1696-the limit was actually discovered by his
teacher Bernoulli.) Three hundred years later we apply his name to other cases
permitted in (6), when f'/g' might approach a limit even if the separate parts do not.
To prove this more general form of l'H6pital's Rule, we need a more general Mean
Value Theorem. I regard the discussion below as optional in a calculus course
(but required in a calculus book). The important idea already came in equation (8).
Remark The basic "indeterminate" is oo - oo. If f(x) and g(x) approach infinity,
anything is possible for f(x) - g(x). We could have x2 - x or x - x2 or (x + 2) - x.
Their limits are oo and - 00 and 2.
At the next level are 0/0 and co/co and 0 oo. To find the limit in these cases, try
l'H6pital's Rule. See Problem 24 when f(x)/g(x) approaches oo/oo. When f(x) - 0
and g(x) -+ co, apply the 0/0 rule to f(x)/(1/g(x)).
The next level has 00 and 1" and oo. Those come from limits of f(x)9(x). If f(x)
approaches 0, 1, or cc while g(x) approaches 0, oo, or 0, we need more information.
A really curious example is x l/In , which shows all three possibilities 00 and 1" and
00o. This function is actually a constant! It equals e.
To go back down a level, take logarithms. Then g(x) In f(x) returns to 0/0 and
0 - cc and l'H6pital's Rule. But logarithms and e have to wait for Chapter 6.
THE GENERALIZED MEAN VALUE THEOREM
The MVT can be extended to two functions. The extension is due to Cauchy, who
cleared up the whole idea of limits. You will recognize the special case g = x as the
ordinary Mean Value Theorem.
3Q

Generalized MVT

If f(x) and g(x) are continuous on [a, b] and

differentiable on (a,b), there isa point a <c<bwhere

[f(b) -f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b) - g(a)Jf'(c).

(9)

The proof comes by constructing a new function that has F(a)=F(b):
F(x) = [f(b) -f(a)]g(x) - [g(b) - g(a)]f(x).
The ordinary Mean Value Theorem leads to F'(c)=0-which is equation (9).
Application 1 (Proof of l'H6pital's Rule) The rule deals with f(a)/g(a) = 0/0. Inserting those zeros into equation (9)leaves f(b)g'(c) = g(b)f'(c). Therefore
f(b)
g(b)

f'(c)
g'(c) -

(10)

As b approaches a, so does c. The point c is squeezed between a and b. The limit of
equation (10) as b -+a and c -+a is l'H6pital's Rule.

3 Applications of the Derlvathre

Application 2 (Error in linear approximation) Section 3.2 stated that the distance
between a curve and its tangent line grows like ( x - a)'. Now we can prove this, and
find out more. Linear approximation is
f ( x )=f (a)+f'(a)(x - a) + error e(x).

( 1 1)

The pattern suggests an error involving f " ( x )and ( x - a)'. The key example f = x2
shows the need for a factor (to cancel f" = 2). The e m in linear approximation is
e(x)=if"(c)(x-a)'

with

a<c<x.

(12)

Key idea Compare the error e(x) to ( x - a)2. Both are zero at x

The Generalized Mean Value Theorem finds a point C between a and x where
e(x)/g(x)= el(C)/g'(C).This is equation (10) with different letters. After checking
el(a)= gl(a)= 0, apply the same theorem to et(x) and gt(x). It produces a point c
between a and C-certainly between a and x-where

3.8 EXERCISES
Read-through questions
The Mean Value Theorem equates the average slope AflAx
over an a [a, b] to the slope df ldx at an unknown b .
The statement is c . It requires f ( x ) to be d on the
e
interval [a, b], with a f on the open interval (a, b).
Rolle's theorem is the special case when f (a)=f (b)= 0, and
the point c satisfies g . The proof chooses c as the point
where f reaches its h .
Consequences of the Mean Value Theorem include:
If f l ( x ) = 0 everywhere in an interval then f ( x ) = i .
The prediction f ( x ) =f ( a ) + I ( x - a ) is exact for
some c between a and x. The quadratic prediction
f ( x )=f (a)+f '(a)@- a) + k ( x - a)2 is exact for another
c. The error in f (a)+f '(a)(x- a) is less than $ M ( x where M is the maximum of I .

A chief consequence is I'Hdpital's Rule, which applies when
.f(x) and g(x) -+ m as x + a. In that case the limit of
f (x)/g(x)equals the limit of n , provided this limit exists.
Normally this limit is f '(a)/gl(a).If this is also 0/0, go on to

Derivatives by the Chain Rule

4.1 The Chain Rule 1

-

You remember that the derivative of f(x)g(x) is not (df/dx)(dg/dx). The derivative
of sin x times x2 is not cos x times 2x. The product rule gave two terms, not one
term. But there is another way of combining the sine function f and the squaring
function g into a single function. The derivative of that new function does involve
the cosine times 2x (but with a certain twist). We will first explain the new function,
and then find the "chain rule" for its derivative.
May I say here that the chain rule is important. It is easy to learn, and you will
use it often. I see it as the third basic way to find derivatives of new functions from
derivatives of old functions. (So far the old functions are xn, sin x, and cos x. Still
ahead are ex and log x.) When f and g are added and multiplied, derivatives come
from the sum rule and product rule. This section combines f and g in a third way.
The new function is sin(x2)-the sine of x2. It is created out of the two original
functions: if x = 3 then x2 = 9 and sin(x2)= sin 9. There is a "chain" of functions,
combining sin x and x2 into the composite function sin(x2). You start with x, then
find g(x), then Jindf (g(x)):
The squaring function gives y = x2. This is g(x).
The sine function produces z = sin y = sin(x2).This is f(g(x)).
The "inside function" g(x) gives y. This is the input to the "outside function" f(y). That
is called composition. It starts with x and ends with z. The composite function is
sometimes written fog (the circle shows the difference from an ordinary product fg).
More often you will see f(g(x)):
Other examples are cos 2x and ( 2 ~ )with
~ , g = 2x. On a calculator you input x, then
push the "g" button, then push the "f" button:
From x compute y = g(x)

From y compute z =f(y).

There is not a button for every function! But the squaring function and sine function
are on most calculators, and they are used in that order. Figure 4.la shows how
squaring will stretch and squeeze the sine function.

4.1 The Chaln Rule

That graph of sin x2 is a crazy FM signal (the Frequency is Modulated). The wave
goes up and down like sin x, but not at the same places. Changing to sin g(x) moves
the peaks left and right. Compare with a product g(x) sin x, which is an AM signal
(the Amplitude is Modulated).
Remark f(g(x)) is usually different from g(f(x)). The order off and g is usually
important. For f(x) = sin x and g(x) = x2, the chain in the opposite order g(f(x)) gives
something different:
First apply the sine function: y = sin x
Then apply the squaring function: z = (sin x ) ~ .
That result is often written sin2x, to save on parentheses. It is never written sin x2,
which is totally different. Compare them in Figure 4.1.

Fig. 4.1 f(g(x)) is different from g(f(x)). Apply g then f,or f then g.

EXAMPLE I The composite functionfig can be deceptive. If g(x) = x3 and fly) = y4,
how does f(g(x)) differ from the ordinary product f(x)g(x)? The ordinary product is
x7. The chain starts with y = x3, and then z = y4 = x12. The composition of 2t3 and
y4 gives f(g(x)) = x12.
EXAMPLE 2 In Newton's method, F(x) is composed with itself. This is iteration.
Every output xn is fed back as input, to find xn+ = F(xn).The example F(x) = f x + 4
has F(F(x)) = f($x 4) + 4. That produces z = &x+ 6.
The derivative of F(x) is t . The derivative of z = F(F(x)) is which is f times f .
We multiply derivatives. This is a special case of the chain rule.

An extremely special case is f (x) = x and g(x) = x. The ordinary product is x2. The
chain f(g(x)) produces only x! The output from the "identity function" is g(x) = x.t
When the second identity function operates on x it produces x again. The derivative
is 1 times 1. I can give more composite functions in a table:

equals input: f(g(x)) = x. These "inverse functions" are in Section 4.3. The other
examples create new functions z(x) and we want their derivatives.
THE DERIVATIVE OF f(g(x))

What is the derivative of z = sin x2? It is the limit of AzlAx. Therefore we look at a
nearby point x + Ax. That change in x produces a change in y = x2-which moves
to y + Ay = (x + AX)^. From this change in y, there is a change in z =f(y). It is a
"domino effect," in which each changed input yields a changed output: Ax produces
Ay produces Az. We have to connect the final Az to the original Ax.
The key is to write AzlAx as AzlAy times AylAx. Then let Ax approach zero.
In the limit, dzldx is given by the "chain rule":
dz dz dy
Az - AzAy
---becomes the chain rule - = - -.

Ax; AyAx

dx

dydx

(2)

As Ax goes to zero, the ratio AylAx approaches dyldx. Therefore Ay must be going
to zero, and AzlAy approaches dzldy. The limit of a product is the product of the
separate limits (end of quick proof). We multiply derivatiues:

I The slope at x is dfldy (at y) times dg/dx (at x).
Caution The chain rule does not say that the derivative of sin x2 is (cos x)(2x).
True, cos y is the derivative of sin y. The point is that cos y must be evaluated at y
(not at x). We do not want dfldx at x, we want dfldy at y = x2:
The derivative of sin x2 is (cos x2) times (2x).

(4)

EXAMPLE 3 If z = (sin x ) ~
then dzldx = (2 sin x)(cos x). Here y = sin x is inside.

In this order, z = y2 leads to dzldy = 2y. It does not lead to 2x. The inside function
sin x produces dyldx = cos x. The answer is 2y cos x. We have not yet found the
function whose derivative is 2x cos x.

4.1 The Chain Rule

The outside function is z = sin y. The inside function is y = 3x. Then dzldy = cos ythis is cos 3x, not cos x. Remember the other factor dy/dx = 3.
I can explain that factor 3, especially if x is switched to t. The distance is z = sin 3t.
That oscillates like sin t except three times as fast. The speeded-up function sin 3t
completes a wave at time 2n/3 (instead of 2.n). Naturally the velocity contains the
extra factor 3 from the chain rule.
EXAMPLE 5 Let z =f(y)

= yn. Find

the derivative of f(g(x)) = [g(x)ln.

In this case dzldy is nyn-'. The chain rule multiplies by dyldx:

This is the power rule! It was already discovered in Section 2.5. Square roots (when
n = 112) are frequent and important. Suppose -y= x2 - 1:

Question A Buick uses 1/20 of a gallon of gas per mile. You drive at 60 miles per
hour. How many gallons per hour?
Answer (Gallons/hour) = (gallons/mile)(mileslhour). The chain rule is (dy/d t) =
(dy/dx)(dx/dt). The answer is (1/20)(60) = 3 gallons/hour.
Proof of the chain rule The discussion above was correctly based on

Az

It was here, over the chain rule, that the "battle of notation" was won by Leibniz.
His notation practically tells you what to do: Take the limit of each term. (I have to
mention that when Ax is approaching zero, it is theoretically possible that Ay might
hit zero. If that happens, Az/Ay becomes 010. We have to assign it the correct meaning,
which is dzldy.) As Ax + 0,

Then AzlAx approaches f '(y) times gf(x),which is the chain rule (dz/dy)(dy/dx).In the

Important All kinds of letters are used for the chain rule. We named the output z.
Very often it is called y, and the inside function is called u:
dy = cos u -.

The derivative of y = sin u(x) is dx
dx
Examples with duldx are extremely common. I have to ask you to accept whatever
letters may come. What never changes is the key idea-derivative of outside function
times derivative of inside function.

4 Derivatives by the Chain Rule

EXAMPLE 6 The chain rule is barely needed for sin(x - 1). Strictly speaking the
inside function is u = x - 1. Then duldx is just 1 (not - 1). If y = sin(x - 1) then
dyldx = cos(x - 1). The graph is shifted and the slope shifts too.
Notice especially: The cosine is computed at x - 1 and not at the unshifted x.
RECOGNIZING f( y) AND g(x)

A big part of the chain rule is recognizing the chain. The table started with (x3 + 1)'.
You look at it for a second. Then you see it as us. The inside function is u = x3 + 1.
With practice this decomposition (the opposite of composition) gets easy:
cos (2x + 1) is cos u

x sin x is ... (product rule!)
is
In calculations, the careful way is to write down all the functions:

&

z = cos u u = 2x + 1 dzldx = (- sin u)(2) = - 2 sin (2x + 1).
The quick way is to keep in your mind "the derivative of what's inside." The slope
of cos(2x + 1) is - sin(2x + I), times 2 from the chain rule. The derivative of 2x + 1
is remembered-without z or u or f or g.
EXAMPLE 7 sin J& is a chain of z = sin y, y =

&,u = 1 - x (threefunctions).

With that triple chain you will have the hang of the chain rule:
The derivative of sin

f i is (cos J

K )

(2&)

(-

This is (dz/dy)(dy/du)(du/dx).Evaluate them at the right places y, u, x.
Finally there is the question of second derivatives. The chain rule gives dzldx as a
product, so d 2 z / d ~needs

the product rule:
dz dy
dz - -dx

----+d2z - dz d2y
dx2

dydx2

d (dz)
- dy
dx dy dx'

That last term needs the chain rule again. It becomes d2z/dy2times ( d ~ / d x ) ~ .
EXAMPLE 8 The derivative of sin x2 is 2x cos x2. Then the product rule gives
d2z/dx2= 2 cos x2 - 4x2 sin x2. In this case ytt= 2 and (yt)2= 4x2.

4.2 Implicit Differentiation and Related Rates
We start with the equations xy = 2 and y5 + xy = 3. As x changes, these y's will
change-to keep (x, y) on the curve. We want to know dy/dx at a typical point. For
xy = 2 that is no trouble, but the slope of y5 + xy = 3 requires a new idea.
In the first case, solve for y = 2/x and take its derivative: dy/dx = - 2/x2. The curve
is a hyperbola. At x = 2 the slope is - 214 = - 112.
The problem with y5 + xy = 3 is that it can't be solved for y. Galois proved that
there is no solution formula for fifth-degree equations.? The function y(x) cannot
be given explicitly. All we have is the implicit definition of y, as a solution to
y5 + xy = 3. The point x = 2, y = 1 satisfies the equation and lies on the curve, but
how to find dyldx?
This section answers that question. It is a situation that often occurs. Equations
like sin y + sin x = 1 or y sin y = x (maybe even sin y = x) are difficult or impossible
to solve directly for y. Nevertheless we can find dyldx at any point.
The way out is implicit differentiation. Work with the equation as it stands. Find
the x derivative of every term in y5 + xy = 3. That includes the constant term 3, whose
derivative is zero.
EXAMPLE I The power rule for y5 and the product rule for xy yield

Now substitute the typical point x = 2 and y = 1, and solve for dyldx:
5 dy

This is implicit differentiation (ID), and you see the idea: Include dyldx from the
chain rule, even if y is not known explicitly as a function of x.

4B (Implicit differentiation) An equation F(x, y) = 0 can be differentiated
directly by the chain rule, without solving for y in terms of x.
The example xy = 2, done implicitly, gives x dy/dx + y = 0. The slope dy/dx is - y/x.
That agrees with the explicit slope - 2/x 2.

ID is explained better by examples than theory (maybe everything is). The essential
theory can be boiled down to one idea: "Go ahead and differentiate."

RELATED RATES

There is a group of problems that has never found a perfect place in calculus. They
seem to fit here-as applications of the chain rule. The problem is to compute
df/dt, but the odd thing is that we are given another derivative dg/dt. To find df/dt,

we need a relation between f and g.
The chain rule is df/dt = (df/dg)(dg/dt). Here the variable is t because that is typical

in applications. From the rate of change of g we find the rate of change off. This is
the problem of related rates, and examples will make the point.
EXAMPLE 5 The radius of a circle is growing by dr/dt = 7. How fast is the circumference growing? Remember that C = 27rr (this relates C to r).
Solution

That is pretty basic, but its implications are amazing. Suppose you want to put a
rope around the earth that any 7-footer can walk under. If the distance is 24,000
miles, what is the additional length of the rope? Answer: Only 147r feet.
More realistically, if two lanes on a circular track are separated by 5 feet, how
much head start should the outside runner get? Only 10i feet. If your speed around
a turn is 55 and the car in the next lane goes 56, who wins? See Problem 14.
Examples 6-8 are from the 1988 Advanced Placement Exams (copyright 1989 by

the College Entrance Examination Board). Their questions are carefully prepared.

In all problems Ifivst wrote down a relationfrom the figure. Then I took its derivative.
Then I substituted known information. (The substitution is after taking the derivative
of tan 8 = y/100. If we substitute y = 50 too soon, the derivative of 50/100 is useless.)

D U P L E 9 A is a lighthouse and BC is the shoreline (same figure as the balloon).
The light at A turns once a second (d8ldt = 211 radianslsecond). How quickly does
the receiving point B move up the shoreline?
Solution The figure shows y = 100 tan 8. The speed dyldt is 100 sec28d8/dt. This is
200n sec28, so B speeds up as sec 8 increases.

Paradox When 8 approaches a right angle, sec 8 approaches infinity. So does
dy/dt. B moves faster than light! This contradicts Einstein's theory of relativity. The
paradox is resolved (I hope) in Problem 18.
If you walk around a light at A, your shadow at B seems to go faster than light.
Same problem. This speed is impossible-something has been forgotten.
Smaller paradox (not destroying the theory of relativity). The figure shows y = z sin 8.
Apparently dyldt = (dzldt) sin 8. This is totally wrong. Not only is it wrong, the exact
opposite is true: dzldt = (dyldt) sin 9. If you can explain that (Problem IS), then ID
and related rates hold no terrors.

There is a remarkable special case of the chain rule. It occurs when f(y) and g(x) are
"inverse functions." That idea is expressed by a very short and powerful equation:
f(g(x)) = x. Here is what that means.
Inverse functions: Start with any input, say x = 5. Compute y = g(x), say y = 3. Then
compute f(y), and the answer must be 5. What one function does, the inverse function

= 5.

The inverse function f takes the output y back to the

EXAMPLE 1 g(x) = x - 2 and f(y) = y + 2 are inverse functions. Starting with x = 5,
the function g subtracts 2. That produces y = 3. Then the function f adds 2. That
brings back x = 5. To say it directly: The inverse of y = x - 2 is x = y + 2.
EXAMPLE 2 y = g(x) = $(x - 32) and x =f(y) = :y + 32 are inverse functions (for
temperature). Here x is degrees Fahrenheit and y is degrees Celsius. From x = 32
(freezing in Fahrenheit) you find y = 0 (freezing in Celsius). The inverse function takes
y = 0 back to x = 32. Figure 4.4 shows how x = 50°F matches y = 10°C.

Notice that $(x - 32) subtracts 32 first. The inverse gy + 32 adds 32 last. In the
same way g multiplies last by $ while f multiplies first by 3.

' and pronounced "g inverse." It is not l/g(x).

If the demand y is a function of the price x, then the price is a function of the demand.
Those are inverse functions. Their derivatives obey a fundamental rule: dyldx times
dxldy equals 1. In Example 2, dyldx is 519 and dxldy is 915.
There is another important point. When f and g are applied in the opposite order,
they still come back to the start. First f adds 2, then g subtracts 2. The chain g(f(y)) =
(y + 2) - 2 brings back y. Iffis the inverse of g then g is the inverse off. The relation
is completely symmetric, and so is the definition:
Inverse function:

If y = g(x) then x = g - '(y). I f x = g - '(y) then y = g(x).

The loop in the figure goes from x to y to x. The composition g - '(g(x)) is the "identity
function." Instead of a new point z it returns to the original x. This will make the
chain rule particularly easy-leading to (dy/dx)(dx/dy) = 1.
EXAMPLE 3 y = g(x) =

f i and x =f(y) = y2 are inverse functions.

Starting from x = 9 we find y = 3. The inverse gives 32 = 9. The square of
f(g(x)) = x. In the opposite direction, the square root of y 2 is g(f(y)) = y.

f i is

Caution That example does not allow x to be negative. The domain of g-the set
of numbers with square roots-is restricted to x 2 0. This matches the range of g - '.
The outputs y2 are nonnegative. With domain of g = range of g-', the equation x =
(&)2 is possible and true. The nonnegative x goes into g and comes out of g-'.
In this example y is also nonnegative. You might think we could square anything,
but y must come back as the square root of y2. So y 2 0.
To summarize: The domain of a function matches the range of its inverse. The inputs
to g-' are the outputs from g. The inputs to g are the outputs from g-'.

4 DerhroHves by the Chaln Rule

Zf g(x) = y then solving that equation for x gives x = g - l(y):
if y = 3x - 6 then x = +(y + 6) (this is g-'(y))
ify=x3+1 thenx=13

(thisisg-'(y))

In practice that is how g-' is computed: Solve g(x) = y. This is the reason inverses
are important. Every time we solve an equation we are computing a value of g Not all equations have one solution. Not all functions have inverses. For each y,
the equation g(x) = y is only allowed to produce one x. That solution is x = g- '(y).
If there is a second solution, then g-l will not be a function-because a function
cannot produce two x's from the same y.

'.

EXAMPLE 4 There is more than one solution to sin x = f. Many angles have the
same sine. On the interval 0 < x < n, the inverse of y = sin x is not a function.
Figure 4.5 shows how two x's give the same y.
Prevent x from passing n/2 and the sine has an inverse. Write x = sin- 'y.

The function g has no inverse if two points x1 and x2 give Ax,) = g(x2). Its inverse
would have to bring the same y back to x1 and x2. No function can do that; g-'(y)
cannot equal both xl and x2. There must be only one x for each y.
To be invertible over an interval, g must be steadily increasing or steadily decreasing.

THE DERWNE OF g-'

It is time for calculus. Forgive me for this very humble example.
EXAMPLE 5 (ordinary multiplication) The inverse of y = g(x) = 3x is x =f(y) = iy.

This shows with special clarity the rule for derivatives: The slopes dyldx = 3 and
dxldy = 5 multiply to give 1. This rule holds for all inverse functions, even if their
slopes are not constant. It is a crucial application of the chain rule to the derivative
of f(g(x)) = x.

This is the chain rule with a special feature. Since f(g(x)) = x, the derivative of both
sides is 1. If we know g' we now know f'. That rule will be tested on a familiar
example. In the next section it leads to totally new derivatives.

4.3 Inverse Functlons and Their Derhrathres

EXAMPLE 6 The inverse of y = x3 is x = y1I3. We can find dxldy two ways:

The equation (dx/dy)(dy/dx)= 1 is not ordinary algebra, but it is true. Those derivatives are limits of fractions. The fractions are (Ax/Ay)(Ay/Ax)= 1 and we let Ax + 0.

Fig. 4.6 Graphs of inverse functions: x = i y is the mirror image of y = 3x.

fi

Before going to new functions, I want to draw graphs. Figure 4.6 shows y =
and y = 3x. What is s ecial is that the same graphs also show the inverse functions.
The inverse of y = $is
x.= y2. The pair x = 4, y = 2 is the same for both. That is
the whole point of inverse functions-if 2 = g(4) then 4 = g - '(2). Notice that the
graphs go steadily up.
The only problem is, the graph of x = g-'(y) is on its side. To change the slope
from 3 to f , you would have to turn the figure. After that turn there is another
problem-the axes don't point to the right and up. You also have to look in a mirror!
(The typesetter refused to print the letters backward. He thinks it's crazy but it's not .)
To keep the book in position, and the typesetter in position, we need a better idea.
The graph of x = i y comes from turning the picture across the 45" line. The y axis
becomes horizontal and x goes upward. The point (2,6) on the line y = 3x goes into
the point (6,2) on the line x = fy. The eyes see a reflection across the 45" line
(Figure 4.6~).The mathematics sees the same pairs x and y. The special properties of
g and g-' allow us to know two functions-and draw two graphs-at the same
time.? The graph of x = g-'(y) is the mirror image of the graph of y = g(x).
EXPONENTIALS AND LOGARITHMS

I would like to add two more examples of inverse functions, because they are so
important. Both examples involve the exponential and the logarithm. One is made up
of linear pieces that imitate 2"; it appeared in Chapter 1. The other is the true function
2", which is not yet defined-and it' is not going to be defined here. The functions bx
and logby are so overwhelmingly important that they deserve and will get a whole
chapter of the book (at least). But you have to see the graphs.
The slopes in the linear model are powers of 2. So are the heights y at the start of
each piece. The slopes 1,2,4, ... equal the heights 1, 2,4, ... at those special points.
The inverse is a discrete model for the logarithm (to base 2). The logarithm of 1 is
0,because 2' = 1. The logarithm of 2 is 1, because 2' = 2. The logarithm of 2j is the
exponent j. Thus the model gives the correct x = log2y at the breakpoints y =
1,2,4, 8, .... The slopes are I,:, $, 4, ... because dxldy = l/(dy/dx).
TI have seen graphs with y=g(x) and also y=g-'(x).
x =g-'(y). If y = sin x then x = sin-'y.

For me that is wrong: it has to be

4 Derlwthres by the Chain Rule

The model is good, but the real thing is better. The figure on the right shows the
true exponential y = 2". At x = 0, 1,2, ... the heights y are the same as before. But
The height at x = .10 is the
now the height at x = is the number 2'12, which is
tenth root 2'/1° = 1.07.... The slope at x = 0 is no longer 1-it is closer to Ay/Ax =
.07/. 10. The exact slope is a number c (near .7) that we are not yet prepared to reveal.
The special property of y = 2" is that the slope at all points is cy. The slope is
proportional to the function. The exponential solves dyldx = cy.
Now look at the inverse function-the logarithm. Its graph is the mirror image:

fi.

If y = ZX then x = log,y. If 2'/1°

1.07 then log, 1.O7

1/10.

What the exponential does, the logarithm undoes-and vice versa. The logarithm of
2" is the exponent x. Since the exponential starts with slope c, the logarithm must
start with slope l/c. Check that numerically. The logarithm of 1.07 is near 1/10. The
slope is near .10/.07. The beautiful property is that dxldy = llcy.

Fig. 4.7 Piecewise linear models and smooth curves: y = 2" and x = log, y. Base b = 2.

I have to mention that calculus avoids logarithms to base 2. The reason lies in that
mysterious number c. It is the "natural logarithm" of 2, which is .693147.. .-and
who wants that? Also 11.693147... enters the slope of log, y. Then (dx/dy)(dy/dx)= 1.
The right choice is to use "natural logarithms" throughout. In place of 2, they are
based on the special number e:
y = ex is the inverse of x = In y.

(2)
The derivatives of those functions are sensational-they are saved for Chapter 6 .
Together with xn and sin x and cos x, they are the backbone of calculus.
Note It is almost possible to go directly to Chapter 6 . The inverse functions x =
sin- 'y and x = tan-'y can be done quickly. The reason for including integrals first
(Chapter 5) is that they solve differential equations with no guesswork:
dy-- y

Integrals have applications of all kinds, spread through the rest of the book. But do
not lose sight of 2" and ex. They solve dyldx = cy-the key to applied calculus.
THE INVERSE OF A CHAIN h(g(x))

The functions g(x) = x - 2 and h(y) = 3y were easy to invert. For g-' we added 2,
and for h-' we divided by 3. Now the question is: If we create the composite function
z = h(g(x)),or z = 3(x - 2), what is its inverse?

4.3 Inverse Functions and Their Derivatives

Virtually all known functions are created in this way, from chains of simpler
functions. The problem is to invert a chain using the inverse of each piece. The answer
is one of the fundamental rules of mathematics:
40 The inverse of z = h(g(x))is a chain of inverses in the opposite order:

(3)

x =g-l(h-f(z)).

'

h- is applied first because h was applied last: g - '(h- (h(g(x))))= x .

That last equation looks like a mess, but it holds the key. In the middle you see
h- ' and h. That part of the chain does nothing! The inverse functions cancel, to leave
g-'(g(x)). But that is x . The whole chain collapses, when g-' and h-' are in the
correct order-which is opposite to the order of h(g(x)).
EXAMPLE 7 z = h(g(x))= 3 ( x - 2) and x = g - ' ( h - ' ( z ) ) = i z + 2.

'

First h- ' divides by 3. Then g - ' adds 2. The inverse of h 0 g is g - o h-'. I t can be
found directly by solving z = 3(x - 2). A chain of inverses is like writing in prose-we
do it without knowing it.
EXAMPLE 8 Invert z

=Jx -2

by writing z2 = x - 2 and then x

= z2

+ 2.

The inverse adds 2 and takes the square-but not in that order. That would give
( z + 2)2, which is wrong. The correct order is z2 + 2.
The domains and ranges are explained by Figure 4.8. We start with x 2 2.
Subtracting 2 gives y 2 0. Taking the square root gives z 3 0. Taking the square
brings back y 3 0. Adding 2 brings back x 3 2-which is in the original domain of g.

Fig. 4.8 The chain g - '(hK1(h(g(x))))
= x is one-to-one at every step.

EXAMPLE 9 Inverse matrices (AB)-'

= B-'A-'

(this linear algebra is optional).

Suppose a vector x is multiplied by a square matrix B: y = g(x) = Bx. The inverse
function multiplies by the inverse matrix: x = g - ' ( y )= B - ' y . It is like multiplication
by B = 3 and B - ' = 113, except that x and y are vectors.
Now suppose a second function multiplies by another matrix A: z = h(g(x))= ABx.
The problem is to recover x from z. The first step is to invert A, because that came
last: Bx = A - ' z . Then the second step multiplies by B-' and brings back x =
B - ' A - ' z . The product B - 'A - ' inverts the product AB. The rule for matrix inverses
is like the rule for function inverses-in fact it is a special case.
I had better not wander too far from calculus. The next section introduces the
inverses of the sine and cosine and tangent, and finds their derivatives. Remember
that the ultimate source is the chain rule.

4.4 Inverses of Trigonometric Functions
Mathematics is built on basic functions like the sine, and on basic ideas like the
inverse. Therefore it is totally natural to invert the sine function. The graph of x =
sin-'y is a mirror image of y = sin x. This is a case where we pay close attention to
the domains, since the sine goes up and down infinitely often. We only want one piece
of that curve, in Figure 4.9.
For the bold line the domain is restricted. The angle x lies between - 7r/2and + n/2.
On that interval the sine is increasing, so each y comesfvom exactly one angle x. If
the whole sine curve is allowed, infinitely many angles would have sin x = 0. The sine

4 Derivatives by the Chain Rule

function could not have an inverse. By restricting to an interval where sin x is increasing, we make the function invertible.
The inverse function brings y back to x. It is x = sin-'y (the inverse sine):
x = sin- 'y when y = sin x and 1x1 < 7112.

(1)

The inverse starts with a number y between - 1 and 1. It produces an angle x =
sin - ly--the angle whose sine is y. The angle x is between - s/2 and 7112, with the
required sine. Historically x was called the "arc sine" of y, and arcsin is used in
computing. The mathematical notation is sin-'. This has nothing to do with l/sin x.
The figure shows the 30" angle x = 7116. Its sine is y = 4.The inverse sine of is 7116.
Again: The symbol sin-'(1) stands for the angle whose sine is 1 (this angle is x =
n/2). We are seeing g- '(g(x)) = x:

EXAMPLE 1 (important) If sin x = y find a formula for cos x.

Solution We are given the sine, we want the cosine. The key to this problem must
be cos2x = 1 - sin2x. When the sine is y, the cosine is the square root of 1 - y2:

(2)

This formula is crucial for computing derivatives. We use it immediately.
THE DERIVATIVE OF THE INVERSE SINE

The calculus problem is to find the slope of the inverse function f(y) = sin-'y.
The chain rule gives (slope of inverse function) = l/(slope of original function).
Certainly the slope of sin x is cos x. To switch from x to y, use equation (2):
dy = cos x so that dx = -1 - --1-y = sin x gives dx

Inverse functions will soon produce two more pairs, from the derivatives of tan-'y
and sec- 'y. The table at the end lists all the essential facts.

At y = 1 the graph of y = sin x is horizontal. The slope is zero. So its mirror image
is vertical. The slope 110 is an extreme case of the chain rule.
Question What is dldx (sin-'x)?

Answer 1/,/1 - x2. I just changed letters.

THE INVERSE COSINE AND ITS DERIVATIVE

Whatever is done for the sine can be done for the cosine. But the domain and range
have to be watched. The graph cannot be allowed to go up and down. Each y from
- 1 to 1 should be the cosine of only one angle x. That puts x between 0 and n. Then
the cosine is steadily decreasing and y = cos x has an inverse:
cos - '(cos x) = x and cos(cos- 'y) = y.

(4)

173

4.4 Inverses of Trigonometric Functions
The cosine of the angle x = 0 is the number y = 1. The inverse cosine of y = 1 is the
angle x = 0. Those both express the same fact, that cos 0 = 1.
For the slope of cos- 'y, we could copy the calculation that succeeded for sin -y.
The chain rule could be applied as in (3). But there is a faster way, because of a
special relation between cos- 'y and sin- 'y. Those angles always add to a right angle:
cos- ly + sin- 'y = ~n/2.

Figure 4.9c shows the angles and Figure 4. 10c shows the graphs. The sum is nT/2 (the
dotted line), and its derivative is zero. So the derivatives of cos- ly and sin-'y must
add to zero. Those derivatives have opposite sign. There is a minus for the inverse
cosine, and its graph goes downward:

Question How can two functions x = sin-ly and x =- cos- y have the same
derivative?
Answer sin -y must be the same as - cos- ly + C. Equation (5) gives C = 7E/2.
THE INVERSE TANGENT AND ITS DERIVATIVE
The tangent is sin x/cos x. The inverse tangent is not sin-'y/cos- 'y. The inverse

function produces the angle whose tangent is y. Figure 4.11 shows that angle, which
is between - 7t/2 and 7r/2. The tangent can be any number, but the inverse tangent
is in the open interval - 7r/2 < x < rn/2. (The interval is "open" because its endpoints

are not included.) The tangents of nr/2 and - 7r/2 are not defined.

EXAMPLE 3 The tangent of x = z/4 is y = 1. We check slopes. On the inverse tangent
curve, dx/dy = 1/(1+ y2)= 1. On the tangent curve, dy/dx = sec2x. At z/4 the secant
squared equals 2. The slopes dx/dy = f and dy/dx = 2 multiply to give 1.

Zmportant Soon will come the following question. What function has the derivative
1/(1+ x2)? One reason for reading this section is to learn the answer. The function
is in equation (8)-if we change letters. It is f(x) = tan- 'x that has sfope 1/(1+ x2).

Note about the inverse secant When y is negative there is a choice for x = sec-ly.
We selected the angle in the second quadrant (between 4 2 and z). Its cosine is
negative, so its secant is negative. This choice makes sec-'y = cos-'(lly), which
matches sec x = l/cos x. It also makes sec- 'y an increasing function, where cos- 'y
is a decreasing function. So we needed the absolute value lyl in the derivative.

4.4 Inverses of Trigonometric Functions

Some mathematical tables make a different choice. The angle x could be in the
third quadrant (between - n and - n/2). Then the slope omits the absolute value.
Summary For the six inverse functions it is only necessary to learn three derivatives.
The other three just have minus signs, as we saw for sin-'y and cos-'y. Each inverse
function and its "cofunction" add to n/2, so their derivatives add to zero. Here are
the six functions for quick reference, with the three new derivatives.

slope dxldy

If y = cos x or y = sin x then lyJ< 1. For y = sec x and y = csc x the opposite is true;
we must have lyl> 1. The graph of sec-ly misses all the points - 1 < y < 1.
Also, that graph misses x = n/2-where the cosine is zero. The secant of n/2 would
be 110 (impossible). Similarly csc- ly misses x = 0, because y = csc 0 cannot be l/sin 0.
The asterisks in the table are to remove those points x = n/2 and x = 0.
The column of derivatives is what we need and use in calculus.

Integrals

5.1 The Idea of the Integral
This chapter is about the idea of integration, and also about the technique of integration. We explain how it is done in principle, and then how it is done in practice.
Integration is a problem of adding up infinitely many things, each of which is infinitesimally small. Doing the addition is not recommended. The whole point of calculus
is to offer a better way.
The problem of integration is to find a limit of sums. The key is to work backward
from a limit of differences (which is the derivative). We can integrate v(x) ifit turns
up as the derivative of another function f(x). The integral of v = cos x is f = sin x. The
integral of v = x is f = $x2. Basically, f(x) is an "antiderivative". The list of j ' s will
grow much longer (Section 5.4 is crucial). A selection is inside the cover of this book.
If we don't find a suitablef(x), numerical integration can still give an excellent answer.
I could go directly to the formulas for integrals, which allow you to compute areas
under the most amazing curves. (Area is the clearest example of adding up infinitely
many infinitely thin rectangles, so it always comes first. It is certainly not the only
problem that integral calculus can solve.) But I am really unwilling just to write down
formulas, and skip over all the ideas. Newton and Leibniz had an absolutely brilliant
intuition, and there is no reason why we can't share it.
They started with something simple. We will do the same.
SUMS A N D DIFFERENCES

Integrals and derivatives can be mostly explained by working (very briefly) with sums
and differences. Instead of functions, we have n ordinary numbers. The key idea is
nothing more than a basic fact of algebra. In the limit as n + co,it becomes the basic
fact of calculus. The step of "going to the limit" is the essential difference between
algebra and calculus! It has to be taken, in order to add up infinitely many
infinitesimals-but we start out this side of it.
To see what happens before the limiting step, we need two sets of n numbers. The
first set will be v,, v,, ..., v,, where suggests velocity. The second set of numbers
will be f, ,f,, ... ,f,, where f recalls the idea of distance. You might think d would
be a better symbol for distance, but that is needed for the dx and dy of calculus.

5 Integrals

A first example has n = 4:
f1,f2,f3,f4= 1, 3, 6, 10.
01, 212, v3, v 4 = L 2 , 3 , 4
The relation between the v's and f's is seen in that example. When you are given
1, 3, 6, 10, how do you produce 1, 2, 3, 4? By taking drerences. The difference
between 10 and 6 is 4. Subtracting 6 - 3 is 3. The differencef2 -fl = 3 - 1 is v2 = 2.
Each v is the difference between two f 's:
vj is the dierencefi

.

This is the discrete form of the derivative. I admit to a small difficulty at j = 1, from
the fact that there is no fo. The first v should be fl -fo, and the natural idea is to
agree that fo is zero. This need for a starting point will come back to haunt us (or
help us) in calculus.
Now look again at those same numbers-but start with v. From v = 1,2,3,4 how
do you produce f = 1,3,6, lo? By taking sums. The first two v's add to 3, which is f2.
The first three v's add to f3 = 6. The sum of all four v's is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Taking
sums is the opposite of taking di$erences.
That idea from algebra is the key to calculus. The sum& involves all the numbers
v, v2 + + vj. The difference vj involves only the two numbers f i - f i - . The fact
that one reverses the other is the "Fundamental Theorem." Calculus will change sums
to integrals and differences to derivatives-but why not let the key idea come through
now?

+

Eventually fn and -fo are left. When fo is zero, the sum is the finalf,.

Question How do you add the odd numbers 1 + 3 + 5 + -..+ 99 (the v's)?
Answer They are the differences between 0, 1,4,9, ... . Thesef's are squares. By the
Fundamental Theorem, the sum of 50 odd numbers is (50)2.
The tricky part is to discover the right f's! Their differences must produce the v's.
In calculus, the tricky part is to find the right f(x). Its derivative must produce v(x).
It is remarkable how often f can be found-more often for integrals than for sums.
Our next step is to understand how the integral is a limit of sums.

The first answer is

fi is still v l
The second answer comes from geometry. The total income is the total area of the
rectangles. We are emphasizing the correspondence between athiition and area. That
point may seem obvious, but it becomes important when a second investor (smarter

Here is the problem. The incomes as stated are false. The company did not make
a million dollars the first year. After three months, when x was 114, the rate of income
was only
= 112. The bar graph showed
= 1 for the whole year, but that was
an overstatement. The income in three months was not more than 112 times 114, the
. rate multiplied by the time.
All other quarters and years were also overstated. Figure 5.2a is closer to reality,
with 4 years divided into 16 quarters. It gives a new estimate for total income.
+ ,/16/4,
Again there are two ways to find the total. We add
remembering to multiply them all by 114 (because each rate applies to 114 year).
This is also the area of the 16 rectangles. The area approach is better because the 114
is automatic. Each rectangle has base 114, so that factor enters each area. The total
area is now 5.56 million dollars, closer to the truth.
You see what is coming. The next step divides time into weeks. After one week the
rate
is only J1/52. That is the height of the first rectangle-its base is Ax =
1/52. There is a rectangle for every week. Then a hard-working investor divides time
into days, and the base of each rectangle is Ax = 11365. At that point there are
4 x 365 = 1460 rectangles, or 1461 because of leap year, with a total area below 5)

not required! But if you allow calculus to repeat that answer, and build up the integral
f(x) = +x2 as the limiting area of many rectangles, you will have the beginning of
something important.
The four rectangles have area 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. That is greater than 8, because
the triangle is inside. 10 is a first approximation to the triangular area 8, and to
improve it we need more rectangles.
The next rectangles will be thinner, of width Ax = 112 instead of the original
Ax = 1. There will be eight rectangles instead of four. They extend above the line,
so the answer is still too high. The new heights are 112, 1, 312, 2, 512, 3, 712, 4. The
total area in Figure 5.4b is the sum of the base Ax = 112 times those heights:
area = $($ + 1 + $ + 2

+ + 4) = 9 (which is closer to 8).

Question What is the area of 16 rectangles? Their heights are $, 3, ... , 4.
Answer With base A x = $ the area is $($+++
+4)=8$.
The effort of doing the addition is increasing. A formula for the sums is needed, and
will be established soon. (The next answer would be 84.) But more important than
the formula is the idea. We are carrying out a Iimiting process, one step at a time. The
area of the rectangles is approaching the area of the triangle, as Ax decreases. The
same limiting process will apply to other areas, in which the region is much more
complicated. Therefore we pause to comment on what is important.
Area Under a Curve
What requirements are imposed on those thinner and thinner rectangles? It is not
essential that they all have the same width. And it is not required that they cover the
triangle completely. The rectangles could lie below the curve. The limiting answer
will still be 8, even if the widths Ax are unequal and the rectangles fit inside the
triangle or across it. We only impose two rules:
1. The largest width Ax,,, must approach zero.
2. The top of each rectangle must touch or cross the curve.
The area under the graph is defined to be the limit of these rectangular areas, if that
limit exists. For the straight line, the limit does exist and equals 8. That limit is
independent of the particular widths and heights-as we absolutely insist it should
be.
Section 5.5 allows any continuous v(x). The question will be the same-Does the
limit exist? The answer will be the same- Yes. That limit will be the integral of v(x),
and it will be the area under the curve. It will be f(x).

EXAMPLE 2 The triangular area from 0 to x is f(base)(height) = f(x)(x). That is
f(x) = f x2. Its derivative is v(x) = x. But notice that fx2 + 1 has the same derivative.
So does f = f x2 C, for any constant C. There is a "constant of integration" in f(x),
which is wiped out in its derivative v(x).

come closer:
f 0) = 7.
rectangular area = f(3f + 3 +

+ +

Sixteen rectangles would have area 7f. We repeat that the rectangles need not have
the same widths Ax, but it makes these calculations easier.
What is the area out to an arbitrary point (like x = 3 or x = l)? We could insert
rectangles, but the Fundamental Theorem offers a faster way. Any antiderivative of
4 - x will give the area. We lookfor afunction whose derivative is 4 - x. The derivative
of 4x is 4, the derivative of fx2 is x, so work backward:
to achieve dfldx = 4 - x choose f(x) = 4x - f x2.
Calculus skips past the rectangles and computes f(3) = 7f. The area between x = 1
and x = 3 is the dference 77:- 3f = 4. In Figure 5.5, this is the area of the trapezoid.
The f-curve flattens out when the v-curve touches zero. No new area is being added.

INDEFINITE INTEGRALS AND DEFINITE INTEGRALS

We have to distinguish two different kinds of integrals. They both use the antiderivative f(x). The definite one involves the limits 0 and 4, the indefinite one doesn't:
The indefinite integral is a function f(x) = 4x - i x 2 .
The definite integral from x = 0 to x = 4 is the number f(4) -f(0).
The definite integral is definitely 8. But the indefinite integral is not necessarily
4x - $x2. We can change f(x) by a constant without changing its derivative (since the

derivative of a constant is zero). The following functions are also antiderivatives:
The first two are particular examples. The last is the general case. The constant C
can be anything (including zero), to give all functions with the required derivative.
The theory of calculus will show that there are no others. The indefinite integral is
the most general antiderivative (with no limits):
indefinite integral f(x) = J v(x) dx = 4x - $ x 2 + C.

(5)

By contrast, the definite integral is a number. It contains no arbitrary constant C.
More that that, it contains no variable x. The definite integral is determined by the
function v(x) and the limits of integration (also known as the endpoints). It is the area
under the graph between those endpoints.
To see the relation of indefinite to definite, answer this question: What is the definite
integral between x = 1 and x = 3? The indefinite integral gives f(3) = 74 + C and
f(1) = 3f + C. To find the area between the limits, subtract f at one limit from f at the
other limit:

The constant cancels itself! The definite integral is the diflerence between the values
of the indefinite integral. C disappears in the subtraction.
The differencef(3) -f(l) is like fn -f,. The sum of v j from 1 to n has become "the
integral of v(x) from 1 to 3." Section 5.3 computes other areas from sums, and 5.4
computes many more from antiderivatives. Then we come back to the definite integral
and the Fundamental Theorem:

5.3 Summation versus Integration

-

This section does integration the hard way. We find explicit formulas for f, =
u, + + u, . From areas of rectangles, the limits produce the area f(x) under a curve.
According to the Fundamental Theorem, dfldx should return us to v(x)-and we
verify in each case that it does.
May I recall that there is sometimes an easier way? If we can find an f(x) whose
derivative is u(x), then the integral of u is$ Sums and limits are not required, when f
is spotted directly. The next section, which explains how to look for f(x), will displace
this one. (If we can't find an antiderivative we fall back on summation.) Given a
successful f, adding any constant produces another f-since the derivative of the
constant is zero. The right constant achievesf(0) = 0, with no extra effort.

Integrals

This section constructs f(x) from sums. The next section searches for antiderivatives.
THE SIGMA NOTATION

In a section about sums, there has to be a decent way to express them. Consider
l 2 + 2' + 32 + 42. The individual terms are vj = j2. Their sum can be written in summation notation, using the capital Greek letter C (pronounced sigma):
1'

x
4

+ 2' + 32 + 42 is written

j2.

j=1

Spoken aloud, that becomes "the sum of j 2 from j = 1 to 4." It equals 30. The limits
on j (written below and above C) indicate where to start and stop:

The k at the end of ( 1 ) makes an additional point. There is nothing special about the
letter j. That is a "dummy variable," no better and no worse than k (or i). Dummy
variables are only on one side (the side with C),and they have no effect on the sum.
The upper limit n is on both sides. Here are six sums:

1
1 1
'f 7
=I +
+ + ... = 2 [infinite series]
2
2 4
-

-

k=O

The numbers 1 and n or 1 and 4 (or 0 and K ) are the lower limit and upper limit.
The dummy variable i or j or k is the index of summation. I hope it seems reasonable
that the infinite series 1 + 3 + $ + adds to 2. We will come back to it in Chapter 10.t
A sum like Z:=, 6 looks meaningless, but it is actually 6 + 6 + ... + 6 = 6n.
It follows the rules. In fact C:=, j 2 is not meaningless either. Every term is j 2 and
by the same rules. that sum is 4j2. However the i was probably intended to be j.
Then the sum is 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.
Question What happens to these sums when the upper limits are changed to n?
Answer The sum depends on the stopping point n. A formula is required (when
possible). Integrals stop at .u, sums stop at n, and we now look for special cases when
.f(.u) or *f,can be found.
A SPECIAL SUMMATION FORMULA

How do you add the first 100 whole numbers? The problem is to compute

tZeno the Greek believed it was impossible to get anywhere, since he would only go halfway
and then half again and half again. Infinite series would have changed his whole life.

5.3 Summation versus Integration

If you were Gauss, you would see the answer at once. (He solved this problem at a
ridiculous age, which gave his friends the idea of getting him into another class.) His
solution was to combine 1 + 100, and 2 + 99, and 3 + 98, always adding to 101. There
are fifty of those combinations. Thus the sum is (50)(101)= 5050.
The sum from 1 to n uses the same idea. The first and last terms add to n + 1. The
next terms n - 1 and 2 also add to n + 1. If n is even (as 100 was) then there are i n
parts. Therefore the sum is i n times n + 1:

The important term is i n 2 , but the exact sum is i n 2 + i n .
What happens if n is an odd number (like n = 99)? Formula (2) remains true. The
combinations 1 + 99 and 2 + 98 still add to n + 1 = 100. There are 399) = 493 such
pairs, because the middle term (which is 50) has nothing to combine with. Thus
1 + 2 + + 99 equals 493 times 100, or 4950.
Remark That sum had to be 4950, because it is 5050 minus 100. The sum up to 99
equals the sum up to 100 with the last term removed. Our key formula fn -fn- = v,
has turned up again!
EXAMPLE Find the sum 101

+ 102 + ... + 200 of the second hundred numbers.

First solution This is the sum from 1 to 200 minus the sum from 1 to 100:

The middle sum is $(200)(201) and the last is i(100)(101). Their difference is 15050.
Note! I left out '7 = "in the limits. It is there, but not written.
Second solution The answer 15050 is exactly the sum of the first hundred numbers

(which was 5050) plus an additional 10000. Believing that a number like 10000 can
never turn up by accident, we look for a reason. It is found through changing the
limits of summation:
200

(k + 100).

j is the same sum as
j = 101

k=l

This is important, to be able to shift limits around. Often the lower limit is moved
to zero or one, for convenience. Both sums have 100 terms (that doesn't change). The
dummy variable j is replaced by another dummy variable k. They are related by
j = k + 100 or equivalently by k =j - 100.
The variable must change everywhere-in the lower limit and the upper limit as
well as inside the sum. If j starts at 101, then k =j - 100 starts at 1. If j ends at 200,
k ends at 100. If j appears in the sum, it is replaced by k + 100 (and if j2 appeared it
would become (k +
From equation (4) you see why the answer is 15050. The sum 1 + 2 + ... + 100 is
5050 as before. 100 is added to each of those 100 terms. That gives 10000.

Why change n to n - 3? Because the upper limit is i = n. So j + 3 = n and j = n - 3.
A final step is possible, and you will often see it. The new variable j can be changed
back to i. Dummy variables have no meaning of their own, but at first the result
looks surprising:

With practice you might do that in one step, skipping the temporary letter j. Every
i on the left becomes i - 1 on the right. Then i = 0, ..., 5 changes to i = 1, ..., 6 . (At
first two steps are safer.) This may seem a minor point, but soon we will be changing
the limits on integrals instead of sums. Integration is parallel to summation, and it
is better to see a "change of variable" here first.

+

Note about 1 2 + .-.+ n. The good thing is that Gauss found the sum f n(n + 1).
The bad thing is that his method looked too much like a trick. I would like to show
how this fits the fundamental rule connecting sums and differences:
Gauss says thatf, is f n(n + 1). Reducing n by 1, his formula for&-, is f (n - 1)n. The
dference f, - f,-, should be the last term n in the sum:
This is the one term v, = n that is included inf, but not inf,-I .
There is a deeper point here. For any sum f,, there are two things to check. The
f's must begin correctly and they must change correctly. The underlying idea is
mathematical induction: Assume the statement is true below n. Prove it for n.
Goat

To prove that 1 + 2 + --.+ n = f n(n + 1). This is the guess f,.

Proof by induction: Check fl (it equals 1). Check f, -f, - (it equals n).
For n = 1 the answer fn(n + 1) = f 1 2 is correct. For n = 2 this formula f 2 3
agrees with 1 + 2. But that separate test is not necessary! Iffl is right, and i f the
changef, -f,-, is right for every n, thenf, must be right. Equation (6) was the key
test, to show that the change in f's agrees with v.
That is the logic behind mathematical induction, but I am not happy with most
of the exercises that use it. There is absolutely no excitement. The answer is given by
some higher power (like Gauss), and it is proved correct by some lower power (like
us). It is much better when we lower powers find the answer for ourse1ves.t Therefore
I will try to do that for the second problem, which is the sum of squares.
THE SUM OF j2AND THE INTEGRAL OF x2

An important calculation comes next. It is the area in Figure 5.6. One region is made
up of rectangles, so its area is a sum of n pieces. The other region lies under the
parabola v = x2. It cannot be divided into rectangles, and calculus is needed.
The first problem is to find f, = 1' + 22 + 32 + + n2. This is a sum of squares,
with fl = 1 and f2 = 5 and f, = 14. The goal is to find the pattern in that sequence.
By trying to guessf, we are copying what will soon be done for integrals.
Calculus looks for an f(x) whose derivative is v(x). There f is an antiderivative (or

an integral). Algebra looks for f,'s whose differences produce v,. Here f, could be
called an antidiflerence (better to call it a sum).
The best start is a good guess. Copying directly from integrals, we might try
fn = fn3. To test if it is right, check whether f, -f n - I
produces on = n2:
We see n2, but also - n + f. The guess f n 3 needs correction terms. To cancel f in the
difference, I subtract f n from the sum. To put back n in the difference, I add
1 + 2 + .-.+ n = qn(n 1) to the sum. The new guess (which should be right) is

+

To check this answer, verify first that f l = 1. Also f2 = 5 and f3 = 14. To be certain,
verify that fn -f,-, = n2. For calculus the important term is in3:

In practice f n 3 is an excellent estimate. The sum of the first 100 squares is approximately f(100)3, or a third of a million. If we need the exact answer, equation (7) is
available: the sum is 338,350. Many applications (example: the number of steps to
solve 100 linear equations) can settle for in3.
What is fascinating is the contrast with calculus. Calculus has no correction terms!
They get washed away in the limit of thin rectangles. When the sum is replaced by
the integral (the area), we get an absolutely clean answer:
The integral of v = x2 from x = 0 to x = n is exactly in3.

The area under the parabola, out to the point x = 100, is precisely a third of a million.
We have to explain why, with many rectangles.
The idea is to approach an infinite number of infinitely thin rectangles. A hundred
rectangles gave an area of 338,350. Now take a thousand rectangles. Their heights
are (&)2, (&)2, ... because the curve is v = x2. The base of every rectangle is
Ax = &, and we add heights times base:

Factor out (&)3. What you have left is l 2 + 22 + + 10002, which fits the sum of
squares formula. The exact area of the thousand rectangles is 333,833.5. I could try
to guess ten thousand rectangles but I won't.
Main point: The area is approaching 333,333.333. ... But the calculations are getting
worse. It is time for algebra-which means that we keep "Ax" and avoid numbers.

The interval of length 100 is divided into n pieces of length Ax. (Thus n = 100/Ax.)

This equation shows what is happening. The leading term is a third of a million,
as predicted. The other terms are approaching zero! They contain Ax, and as the
rectangles get thinner they disappear. They only account for the small corners of
rectangles that lie above the curve. The vanishing of those corners will eventually be
proved for any continuous functions-the area from the correction terms goes to
zero-but here in equation (9) you see it explicitly.
The area under the curve came from the central idea of integration: 100/Ax rectanThe rectangular area is Z vj Ax.
gles of width Ax approach the limiting area = f
The exact area is j V(X)dx. In the limit Z becomes j and vj becomes v(x) and AX
becomes dx.
That completes the calculation for a parabola. It used the formula for a sum of
squares, which was special. But the underlying idea is much more general. The limit
of the sums agrees with the antiderivative: The antiderivative of v(x) = x2 isf(x) = i x 3 .
According to the Fundamental Theorem, the area under v(x) is f(x):
That Fundamental Theorem is not yet proved! I mean it is not proved by us. Whether
Leibniz or Newton managed to prove it, I am not quite sure. But it can be done.
Starting from sums of differences, the difficulty is that we have too many limits at
once. The sums of cjAx are approaching the integral. The differences Af/Ax approach
the derivative. A real proof has to separate those steps, and Section 5.7 will do it.
Proved or not, you are seeing the main point. What was true for the numbersf,
and cj is true in the limit for u(x) and.f(x). Now v(s) can vary continuously, but it is
still the slope of f'(s).The reverse of slope is area.

Finally we review the area under r; = x. The sum of 1 + 2 + + n is i n 2 + i n . This
gives the area of n = 4/Ax rectangles, going out to x = 4. The heights are jAx, the
bases are Ax, and we add areas:

193

5.3 Summation versus Integration

With A x = 1 the area is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. With eight rectangles and Ax = f, the
area was 8 + 2Ax = 9. Sixteen rectangles of width i brought the correction 2Ax down
to f . The exact area is 8. The error is proportional to A x .
Important note There you see a question in applied mathematics. If there is an error,
what size is it? How does it behave as Ax + O? The A x term disappears in the limit,
and AX)^ disappears faster. But to get an error of
we need eight million
rectangles:
2A x = 2 4/8,000,000 = 10- 6.

That is horrifying! The numbers 10,9, 83, 8 i , ... seem to approach the area 8 in a
satisfactory way, but the convergence is much too slow. It takes twice as much work
to get one more binary digit in the answer-which is absolutely unacceptable. Somehow the A x term must be removed. If the correction is AX)^ instead of A x , then a
thousand rectangles will reach an accuracy of
The problem is that the rectangles are unbalanced. Their right sides touch the graph
of v, but their left sides are much too high. The best is to cross the graph in the middle
of the interval-this is the midpoint rule. Then the rectangle sits halfway across the
line v = x, and the error is zero. Section 5.8 comes back to this rule-and to Simpson's
rule that fits parabolas and removes the S AX)^ term and is built into many calculators.
Finally we try the quick way. The area under v = x is f = f x 2 , because dfldx is v.
The area out to x = 4 is 3(4)2= 8. Done.

Calculus doesn't care if the upper limit n is an integer, and it doesn't care if the power
p is an integer. We only need p + 1 > 0 to be sure nP+ is genuinely the leading term.
The antiderivative of v = xP is f = xP+' / ( p 1 ) .
We are close to interesting experiments. The correction terms disappear and the
sum approaches the integral. Here are actual numbers for p = 1, when the sum and
integral are easy: Sn= 1 + --.+ n and In= x dx = i n 2 . The difference is Dn= f n. The
thing to watch is the relative error En= Dn/In:

it should show how quick (or slow) that convergence will be.

integrating x2 from 0 to 100, which compares to the sum Sloe of 100 squares:

on p. I hope you can push the experiments far enough to discover C(p). This is not
an exercise with an answer in the back of the book-it is mathematics.

This section integrates the easy way, by looking for antiderivatives. We leave aside
sums of rectangular areas, and their limits as Ax -+ 0.Instead we search for an f (x)
with the required derivative u(x). In practice, this approach is more or less independent of the approach through sums-but it gives the same answer. And also, the

5 Integrals

search for an antiderivative may not succeed. We may not find f. In that case we go
back to rectangles, or on to something better in Section 5.8.
A computer is ready to integrate v, but not by discovering f . It integrates between
specified limits, to obtain a number (the definite integral). Here we hope to find a
function (the indefinite integral). That requires a symbolic integration code like
MACSYMA or Mathematica or MAPLE, or a reasonably nice v(x), or both. An
expression for f (x) can have tremendous advantages over a list of numbers.
Thus our goal is to find antiderivatives and use them. The techniques will be further
developed in Chapter 7-this section is short but good. First we write down what
we know. On each line, f (x) is an antiderivative of v(x) because df /dx = v(x).

You recognize that each integration formula came directly from a differentiation
formula. The integral of the cosine is the sine, because the derivative of the sine is
the cosine. For emphasis we list three derivatives above three integrals:

There are two ways to make this list longer. One is to find the derivative of a new
f (x). Then f goes in one column and v = df/dx goes in the other co1umn.T The other
possibility is to use rules for derivatives to find rules for integrals. That is the way to
extend the list, enormously and easily.
RULES FOR INTEGRALS

Among the rules for derivatives, three were of supreme importance. They were linearity, the product rule, and the chain rule. Everything flowed from those three. In the

calculus also dominate integral calculus:
linearity of derivatives -,linearity of integrals
product rule for derivatives -+ integration by parts
chain rule for derivatives -+ integrals by substitution
The easiest is linearity, which comes first. Integration by parts will be left for
Section 7.1. This section starts on substitutions, reversing the chain rule to make an
integral simpler.
LINEARITY OF INTEGRALS

What is the integral of v(x) w(x)? Add the two separate integrals. The graph of

Adding areas gives the sum rule. Suppose f and g are antiderivatives of v and w:

This is a case of overkill. The first two rules are special cases of the third, so logically
the last rule is enough. However it is so important to deal quickly with constantsjust "factor them outv-that the rule cv-cf is stated separately. The proofs come
from the linearity of derivatives: (af + bg)' equals af' + bg' which equals av + bw.
The rules can be restated with integral signs:

Note about the constant in f ( x )+ C. All antiderivatives allow the addition of a constant. For a combination like av(x)+ bw(x), the antiderivative is af ( x )+ bg(x)+ C.
The constants for each part combine into a single constant. To give all possible antiderivatives of a function, just remember to write "+ C" after one of them. The real
problem is to find that one antiderivative.

INTEGRALS BY SUBSTITUTION

We now present the most valuable technique in this section-substitution.
idea, you have to remember the chain rule:

To see the

f (g(x)) has derivative f '(g(x))(dg/dx)
sin x2 has derivative (cos x2)(2x)
(x3 + 1)'

has derivative 5(x3+ ll4(3x2)

If the function on the right is given, the function on the left is its antiderivative! There
are two points to emphasize right away:
1. Constants are no problem-they

can always be jixed. Divide by 2 or 15:

Notice the 2 from x2, the 5 from the fifth power, and the 3 from x3.
2. Choosing the insid?function g (or u) commits us to its derivative:
the integral of 2x cos x2 is sin x2 + C (g = x2, dgldx = 2x)
the integral of cos x2 is (failure)

(no dgldx)

the integral of x2 cos x2 is (failure)

(wrong dgldx)

To substitute g for x2, we need its derivative. The trick is to spot an inside function
whose derivative is present. We can fix constants like 2 or 15, but otherwise dgldx
has to be there. Very often the insidefunction g is written u. We use that letter to state
the substitution rule, when f is the integral of v :

EXAMPLE 4
EXAMPLE 5
EXAMPLE 6

1sin x cos x dx = &(sinx)' + C
1sin2x cos x dx = $(sin x ) +~ C
j cos x sin x dx = - f (cos x ) +~ C

u = sin x (compare Example 6)
u = sin x
u = cos x (compare Example 4)

The next example has u = x2 - 1 and duldx = 2x. The key step is choosing u:

A ship of x (to x + 2) or a multiple of x (rescaling to 2x) is particularly easy:
EXAMPLES 9-40

5 (x + 2)) dx = $(x + 2)4 + C

j cos 2x dx = f sin 2x + C

You will soon be able to do those in your sleep. Officially the derivative of (x + 2)4
uses the chain rule. But the inside function u = x + 2 has duldx = 1. The "1" is there
automatically, and the graph shifts over-as in Figure 5.8b.
For Example 10 the inside function is u = 2x. Its derivative is duldx = 2. This

required factor 2 is missing in J cos 2x dx, but we put it there by multiplying and
dividing by 2. Check the derivative of ½ sin 2x: the 2 from the chain rule cancels the
½. The rule for any nonzero constant is similar:

Sv(x + c) dx =f(x

+ c)

v(cx) dx= f (cx).

and

Squeezing the graph by c divides the area by c. Now 3x + 7 rescales and shifts:

f cos(3x+7) dx= ' sin(3x+7)+ C

(3x+7)3 + C

(3x+7)2 dx=

Remark on writing down the steps When the substitution is complicated, it is a good
idea to get du/dx where you need it. Here 3x2 + 1 needs 6x:

Check the derivative at the end. The exponent 5 cancels 5 in the denominator, 6x from

the chain rule cancels 6, and 7x is what we started with.

(4)

This really shows how substitution works. We switch from x to u, and we also switch

from dx to du. The most common mistake is to confuse dx with du. The factor du/dx
from the chain rule is absolutely needed, to reach du. The change of variables (dummy
variables anyway!) leaves an easy integral, and then u turns back into 3x 2 + 1. Here
are the four steps to substitute u for x:
1. Choose u(x) and compute du/dx
2. Locate v(u) times du/dx times dx, or v(u) times du

3. Integrate J v(u) du to find f(u) + C
4. Substitute u(x) back into this antiderivative f.
EXAMPLE 12

J(cos Vx) dxl 2/:

(integrate) (put back x)

The choice of u must be right, to change everything from x to u. With ingenuity,
some remarkable integrals are possible. But most will remain impossible forever. The
functions cos x 2 and 1/ 4 - sin 2 x have no "elementary" antiderivative. Those integrals are well defined and they come up in applications--the latter gives the distance

around an ellipse. That can be computed to tremendous accuracy, but not to perfect
accuracy.
The exercises concentrate on substitutions, which need and deserve practice. We
give a nonexample-1 (x2 + dx does not equal i ( x 2 + l)3-to emphasize the need
for duldx. Since 2x is missing, u = x2 1 does not work. But we can fix up n:

5.5 The Deflnlte Integral

The Definite lntearal
The integral of v(x) is an antiderivative f(x) plus a constant C. This section takes
two steps. First, we choose C. Second, we construct f (x). The object is to define the
integral-in the most frequent case when a suitable f (x) is not directly known.
The indefinite integral contains " + C." The constant is not settled because f (x) + C
has the same slope for every C. When we care only about the derivative, C makes
no difference. When the goal is a number-a definite integral-C can be assigned a
definite value at the starting point.
For mileage traveled, we subtract the reading at the start. This section does the
same for area. Distance is f(t) and area is f(x)-while the definite integral is
f (b) -f (a). Don't pay attention to t or x, pay attention to the great formula of integral
calculus:

lab Iab
~ ( tdt
) =

V(X)d~ =f (b) -f (a).

Viewpoint 1: When f is known, the equation gives the area from a to b.
Viewpoint 2: When f is not known, the equation defines f from the area.
For a typical v(x), we can't find f (x) by guessing or substitution. But still v(x) has an
"area" under its graph-and this yields the desired integral f (x).
Most of this section is theoretical, leading to the definition of the integral. You
may think we should have defined integrals before computing them-which is logically true. But the idea of area (and the use of rectangles) was already pretty clear in
our first examples. Now we go much further. Every continuous function v(x) has an
integral (also some discontinuous functions). Then the Fundamental Theorem completes the circle: The integral leads back to dfldx = u(x). The area up to x is the
antiderivative that we couldn't otherwise discover.
THE CONSTANT OF INTEGRATION

Our goal is to turn f (x) + C into a definite integral- the area between a and b. The
first requirement is to have area = zero at the start:

f (a) + C = starting area = 0 so C = -f (a).

(2)

For the area up to x (moving endpoint, indefinite integral), use t as the dummy variable:
the area from a to x is 1; v(t) dt =f (x) -f (a) (indefinite integral)
the a m a f r o a to b is
EXAMPLE I

v(x) dx =f (b) -f (a) (definite integral)

The area under the graph of 5(x + 1)4 from a to b has f (x) = (x + 1)':

The calculation has two separate steps-first find f (x), then substitute b and a. After
the first step, check that df /dx is v. The upper limit in the second step gives plus f (b),
the lower limit gives minus f(a). Notice the brackets (or the vertical bar):
f(x)]: =f(b)- f(a)

x31: = 8 - 1

Changing the example to f (x) = (x +

[cos

XI:'=cos 2t - 1.

- 1 gives an equally good antiderivative-

and now f (0)= 0. But f (b)-f (a)stays the same, because the - 1 disappears:

+

[ ( x + 1)' - 11: = ((b+ 1)' - 1) - ((a+ 1)' - 1)= (b + 1)' - (a 1)'.
EXAMPLE 2 When v = 2x sin x2 we recognize f = - cos x2. m e area from 0 to 3 is

The upper limit copies the minus sign. The lower limit gives - (- cos 0), which is
+ cos 0. That example shows the right form for solving exercises on dejkite integrals.
Example 2 jumped directly to f ( x )= - cos x2. But most problems involving the
chain rule go more slowly-by substitution. Set u = x2, with duldx = 2x:

IO3

2x sin x2 dx =

lo3

du
sin u - dx =
dx

sin u du.

We need new limits when u replaces x2. Those limits on u are a' and b2. (In this case
a' = O2 and b2 = 32 = 9.) Z f x goes from a to b, then u goesfrom ~ ( ato) u(b).

In this case u = x2 + 5. Therefore duldx = 2x (or du = 2x dx for differentials). We have
to account for the missing 2. The integral is Qu4. The limits on u = x2 + 5 are
u(0)= O2 + 5 and u(1)= 1' + 5. That is why the u-integral goes from 5 to 6. The
alternative is to find f ( x )= Q(x2+ 5)4 in one jump (and check it).
EXAMPLE 4

1: sin x2 dx = ?? (no elementaryfunction gives this integral).

If we try cos x2, the chain rule produces an extra 2x-no adjustment will work. Does
sin x2 still have an antiderivative? Yes! Every continuous v(x) has an f (x).Whether
f ( x ) has an algebraic formula or not, we can write it as J v(x)dx. To define that
integral, we now take the limit of rectangular areas.
INTEGRALS AS LIMITS OF "RIEMANN SUMS"

We have come to the definition of the integral. The chapter started with the integrals
of x and x2, from formulas for 1 + ..- + n and l 2 + ..- + n2. We will not go back to
those formulas. But for other functions, too irregular to find exact sums, the rectangular areas also approach a limit.
That limit is the integral. This definition is a major step in the theory of calculus.
It can be studied in detail, or understood in principle. The truth is that the definition
is not so painful-you virtually know it already.
Problem Integrate the continuousfunction v(x)over the interval [a, b].
Split [a, b] into n subintervals [a, x,], [x,, x 2 ] , ..., [xn- b].

Step 1

The "meshpoints" x,, x2, ... divide up the interval from a to b. The endpoints are
xo = a and x, = b. The length of subinterval k is Ax, = xk - xk- l . In that smaller
interval, the minimum of v(x) is mk.The maximum is M,.

203

5.5 The Definite Integral
Now construct rectangles. The "lower rectangle" over interval k has height mk. The
"upper rectangle" reaches to Mk. Since v is continuous, there are points Xmin and Xmax
where v = mk and v = Mk (extreme value theorem). The graph of v(x) is in between.
Important: The area under v(x) contains the area "s" of the lower rectangles:

fb v(x) dx > m

s.

(5)

The area under v(x) is contained in the area "S" of the upper rectangles:

fbv(x) dx

MAx + M2 Ax 2 +

+ MAxn= S.

(6)

The lower sum s and the upper sum S were computed earlier in special cases-when
v was x or x 2 and the spacings Ax were equal. Figure 5.9a shows why s < area < S.

Area of lower rectangles = s. Upper sum S includes top pieces. Riemann sum S* is in between.

Notice an important fact. When a new dividing point x' is added, the lower sum
increases. The minimum in one piece can be greater (see second figure) than the
original mk. Similarly the upper sum decreases. The maximum in one piece can be
below the overall maximum. As new points are added, s goes up and S comes down.
So the sums come closer together:
s < s'

<

IS'< S.

(7)

I have left space in between for the curved area-the integral of v(x).
Now add more and more meshpoints in such a way that Axmax -+ 0. The lower
sums increase and the upper sums decrease. They never pass each other. If v(x) is
continuous, those sums close in on a single number A. That number is the definite
integral-the area under the graph.
DEFINITION

The area A is the common limit of the lower and upper sums:
s - A and S -+ A as Axmax -+ 0.

(8)

This limit A exists for all continuous v(x), and also for some discontinuous functions.
When it exists, A is the "Riemann integral" of v(x) from a to b.
REMARKS ON THE INTEGRAL
As for derivatives, so for integrals: The definition involves a limit. Calculus is built
on limits, and we always add "if the limit exists." That is the delicate point. I hope
the next five remarks (increasingly technical) will help to distinguish functions that
are Riemann integrable from functions that are not.
Remark 1 The sums s and S may fail to approach the same limit. A standard
example has V(x) = 1 at all fractions x = p/q, and V(x) = 0 at all other points. Every

X

204

5 Integrals
interval contains rational points (fractions) and irrational points (nonrepeating decimals). Therefore mk = 0 and Mk = 1. The lower sum is always s = 0. The upper sum
is always S = b - a (the sum of 1's times Ax's). The gap in equation (7) stays open. This

function V(x) is not Riemann integrable. The area under its graph is not defined (at
least by Riemann-see Remark 5).
Remark 2 The step function U(x) is discontinuous but still integrable. On every
interval the minimum mk equals the maximum Mk-except on the interval containing
the jump. That jump interval has mk = 0 and Mk = 1. But when we multiply by Axk,
and require Axmax -+ 0, the difference between s and S goes to zero. The area under

a step function is clear-the rectangles fit exactly.
Remark 3 With patience another key step could be proved: If s -+ A and S -+ A for
one sequence of meshpoints, then this limit A is approached by every choice of meshpoints with Axmax
,
0. The integral is the lower bound of all upper sums S, and it is

the upper bound of all possible s-provided those bounds are equal. The gap must
close, to define the integral.
The same limit A is approached by "in-between rectangles." The height v(x*) can
be computed at any point x* in subinterval k. See Figures 5.9c and 5.10. Then the
total rectangular area is a "Riemann sum" between s and S:
S= v(x )Ax 1 + v(x*)Ax

2

+

...

+ v(x*)Ax.

(9)

We cannot tell whether the true area is above or below S*. Very often A is closer to
S* than to s or S. The midpoint rule takes x * in the middle of its interval (Figure 5.10),
and Section 5.8 will establish its extra accuracy. The extreme sums s and S are used
in the definition while S* is used in computation.

any x k

Various positions for x*' in the base. The rectangles have height v(x*).

Every continuous function is Riemann integrable. The proof is optional (in

my class), but it belongs here for reference. It starts with continuity at x*: "For any
e there is a 6 .... " When the rectangles sit between x* - 6 and x* + 6, the bounds Mk
and mk differ by less than 2e. Multiplying by the base Axk, the areas differ by less
than 2e(AXk). Combining all rectangles, the upper and lower sums differ by less than
2e(Ax 1 + Ax 2 + ... + Ax,)= 2e(b - a).
As e -+ 0 we conclude that S comes arbitrarily close to s. They squeeze in on a
single number A. The Riemann sums approach the Riemann integral, ifv is continuous.
Two problems are hidden by that reasoning. One is at the end, where S and s come
together. We have to know that the line of real numbers has no "holes," so there is
a number A to which these sequences converge. That is true.
Any increasingsequence, if it is bounded above, approaches a limit.

The decreasing sequence S, bounded below, converges to the same limit. So A exists.
The other problem is about continuity. We assumed without saying so that the

5.5 The Definite Integral

width 26 is the same around every point x*. We did not allow for the possibility that
6 might approach zero where v(x) is rapidly changing-in which case an infinite
number of rectangles could be needed. Our reasoning requires that
v(x) is unifomly continuous: 6 depends on E but not on the position of x*.
For each E there is a 6 that works at all points in the interval. A continuousfunction
on a closed interval is uniformly continuous. This fact (proof omitted) makes the
reasoning correct, and v(x) is integrable.
On an infinite interval, even v = x2 is not uniformly continuous. It changes across
~ - 6)2= 4x*6. As x* gets larger, 6 must get smallera subinterval by (x* + ~ 5-) (x*
to keep 4x*6 below E. No single 6 succeeds at all x*. But on a finite interval [O, b],
the choice 6 = ~ / 4 bworks everywhere-so v = x2 is uniformly continuous.
Remark 5 If those four remarks were fairly optional, this one is totally at your
discretion. Modern mathematics needs to integrate the zero-one function V(x) in the
first remark. Somehow V has more 0's than 1's. The fractions (where V(x) = 1) can
be put in a list, but the irrational numbers (where V(x) = 0) are "uncountable." The
integral ought to be zero, but Riemann's upper sums all involve M , = 1.
Lebesgue discovered a major improvement. He allowed infinitely many subintervals
(smaller and smaller). Then all fractions can be covered with intervals of total width
E. (Amazing, when the fractions are packed so densely.) The idea is to cover 1/q, 2/q,
...,q/q by narrow intervals of total width ~ 1 2Combining
~.
all q = 1,2, 3, ...,the total
width to cover all fractions is no more than E(&+ $ + $ + --.)= E. Since V(x) = 0
everywhere else, the upper sum S is only E. And since E was arbitrary, the "Lebesgue
integral" is zero as desired.

That completes a fair amount of theory, possibly more than you want or needbut it is satisfying to get things straight. The definition of the integral is still being
studied by experts (and so is the derivative, again to allow more functions). By
contrast, the properties of the integral are used by everybody. Therefore the next

Properties of the Integral and Average Value

m

The previous section reached the definition of 1: v(x) dx. But the subject cannot stop
there. The integral was defined in order to be used. Its properties are important, and
its applications are even more important. The definition was chosen so that the
integral has properties that make the applications possible.
One direct application is to the average value of v(x). The average of n numbers is
clear, and the integral extends that idea-it produces the average of a whole continuum of numbers v(x). This develops from the last rule in the following list (Property
7). We now collect together seven basic properties of defirrite integrals.
The addition rule for [v(x) + w(x)] dx will not be repeated-even though this
property of linearity is the most fundamental. We start instead with a different kind
of addition. There is only one function v(x), but now there are two intervals.
The integralfrom a to b is added to its neighborfrom b to c. Their sum is the integral
from a to c. That is the first (not surprising) property in the list.

207

5.6 Properties of the Integral and Average Value
Property 1 Areas over neighboring intervals add to the area over the combined
interval:
v(x) dx + I' v(x) dx = J v(x) dx.
(1)

J

This sum of areas is graphically obvious (Figure 5.1 la). It also comes from the formal
definition of the integral. Rectangular areas obey (1)-with a meshpoint at x = b to
make sure. When Axmax approaches zero, their limits also obey (1). All the normal
rules for rectangularareas are obeyed in the limit by integrals.
Property 1 is worth pursuing. It indicates how to define the integral when a = b.
The integral "from b to b" is the area over a point, which we expect to be zero. It is.

fb v(x) dx = 0.

Property 2

That comes from Property 1 when c = b. Equation (1) has two identical integrals, so
the one from b to b must be zero. Next we see what happens if c = a-which makes
the second integral go from b to a.
What happens when an integralgoes backward? The "lower limit" is now the larger
number b. The "upper limit" a is smaller. Going backward reverses the sign:

fa v(x)

Property 3

dx = -

f~ v(x) dx =f(a)-f(b).

Proof When c = a the right side of (1) is zero. Then the integrals on the left side
must cancel, which is Property 3. In goingfrom b to a the steps Ax are negative. That
justifies a minus sign on the rectangular areas, and a minus sign on the integral
(Figure 5.1 1b). Conclusion: Property 1 holds for any ordering of a, b, c.
EXAMPLES

t2 dt = - -

dt = -1

_=0

Property 4 For odd functions Ja, v(x) dx = O0."Odd" means that v(- x) = - v(x).
For even functions •-a v(x) dx = 2 fo v(x) dx. "Even" means that v(- x) = + v(x).

The functions x, x3 , x 5, ... are odd. If x changes sign, these powers change sign. The
functions sin x and tan x are also odd, together with their inverses. This is an important family of functions, and the integralof an odd function from - a to a equals zero.

Areas cancel:

j•a

6x d= x]',

a6 -(- a)6 = 0.

If v(x) is odd then f(x) is even! All powers 1, x 2, x4 ,... are even functions. Curious

fact: Odd function times even function is odd, but odd number times even number is
even.
For even functions, areas add: J"a cos x dx = sin a - sin(- a) = 2 sin a.

The next properties involve inequalities. If v(x) is positive, the area under its graph
is positive (not surprising). Now we have a proof: The lower sums s are positive and
they increase toward the area integral. So the integral is positive:
Property 5 If v(x) > 0 for a < x < b then J v(x) dx > 0.
A positive velocity means a positive distance. A positive v lies above a positive area.
A more general statement is true. Suppose v(x) stays between a lower function 1(x)
and an upper function u(x). Then the rectangles for v stay between the rectangles for 1
and u. In the limit, the area under v (Figure 5.12) is between the areas under I and u:

1 leads to tan- x < x.

All those examples are for x > 0. You may remember that Section 2.4 used geometry
to prove sin h < h < tan h. Examples 1-2 seem to give new and shorter proofs. But I
think the reasoning is doubtful. The inequalities were needed to compute the derivatives (therefore the integrals) in the first place.

Vave

Fig. 5.12 Properties 5-7: v above zero, v between 1and u, average value (+ balances -).

Property 7 (Mean Value Theorem for Integrals) If v(x) is continuous, there is a
point c between a and b where v(c) equals the average value of v(x):

(cv(c)b-a I a v(x) dx = "average value of v(x)."

(3)

This is the same as the ordinary Mean Value Theorem (for the derivative of f(x)):
f'(c) -

f(b) -f(a)

b-a (a)-

average slope of f."

(4)

With f' = v, (3) and (4) are the same equation. But honesty makes me admit to a flaw
in the logic. We need the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to guarantee that
f(x) = f v(t) dt really gives f'= v.
A direct proof of (3)places one rectangle across the interval trom a to b. Now raise
the top of that rectangle, starting at Vmin (the bottom of the curve) and moving up to
vmax (the top of the curve). At some height the area will be just right-equal to the
area under the curve. Then the rectangular area, which is (b - a) times v(c), equals
the curved area Jf v(x) dx. This is equation (3).

That direct proof uses the intermediate value theorem: A continuous function v(x)
takes on every height between v,, and v,,,. At some point (at two points in
Figure 5.12~)the function v(x) equals its own average value.
Figure 5.13 shows equal areas above and below the average height v(c) = vaVe.

Where does this function x2 equal its average value f? That happens when c2 = f , so
c can be either of the points I/& and - 1/J? in Figure 5.13b. Those are the Gauss
points, which are terrific for numerical integration as Section 5.8 will show.

The point c is n/4 or 344, where sin2 c = $. The graph of sin2x oscillates around its
average value f . See the figure or the formula:
sin2 x = f - f cos 2x.

(5)

The steady term is f , the oscillation is - 4 cos 2x. The integral is f (x) = i x - sin 2x,
which is the same as f x - i sin x cos x. This integral of sin2 x will be seen again. Please
verify that df /dx = sin2x.
THE AVERAGE VALUE AND EXPECTED VALUE

The "average value" from a to b is the integral divided by the length b - a. This
was computed for x and x2 and sin2 x, but not explained. It is a major application
of the integral, and it is guided by the ordinary average of n numbers:

In ordinary language: "The average value of the numbers between 0 and 1 is 4." Since
a whole continuum of numbers lies between 0 and 1, that statement is meaningless
until we have integration.
The average value of the squares of those numbers is (x2),,, = x2dx/(b - a) = 4.
Ifyou pick a number randomly between 0 and 1, its expected value is 5 and its expected
square is 3.
To me that sentence is a puzzle. First, we don't expect the number to be exactly
&so we need to define "expected value." Second, if the expected value is 9, why is
the expected square equal to 3 instead of i?The ideas come from probability theory,
and calculus is leading us to continuous probability. We introduce it briefly here, and
come back to it in Chapter 8.
PREDlClABLE AVERAGES FROM RANDOM EVENTS

Suppose you throw a pair of dice. The outcome is not predictable. Otherwise why
throw them? But the average over more and more throws is totally predictable. We
don't know what will happen, but we know its probability.
For dice, we are adding two numbers between 1 and 6. The outcome is between 2
and 12. The probability of 2 is the chance of two ones: (1/6)(1/6)= 1/36. Beside each
outcome we can write its probability:

To repeat, one roll is unpredictable. Only the probabilities are known, and they add
to 1. (Those fractions add to 36/36; all possibilities are covered.) The total from a
million rolls is even more unpredictable-it can be anywhere between 2,000,000 and
12,000,000. Nevertheless the average of those million outcomes is almost completely
predictable. This expected value is found by adding the products in that line above:
Expected value: multiply (outcome)times (probability of outcome) and add:

If you throw the dice 1000 times, and the average is not between 6.9 and 7.1, you get
an A. Use the random number generator on a computer and round off to integers.
Now comes continuous probability. Suppose all numbers between 2 and 12 are
equally probable. This means all numbers-not just integers. What is the probability
of hitting the particular number x = n? It is zero! By any reasonable measure, n has

5.6 Properties of the Integral and Average Value

no chance to occur. In the continuous case, every x has probability zero. But an
interval of x's has a nonzero probability:
the probability of an outcome between 2 and 3 is 1/10
the probability of an outcome between x and x + Ax is Ax110
To find the average, add up each outcome times the probability of that outcome.
First divide 2 to 12 into intervals of length Ax = 1 and probability p = 1/10. If we
round off x, the average is 63:

Here all outcomes are integers (as with dice). It is more accurate to use 20 intervals
of length 112 and probability 1/20. The average is 6$, and you see what is coming.
These are rectangular areas (Riemann sums). As Ax -+ 0 they approach an integral.
The probability of an outcome between x and x + dx is p(x) dx, and this problem has
p(x) = 1/10. The average outcome in the continuous case is not a sum but an integral:
expected value E(x) =

dx x2
xp(x) dx = S212 x 10= 20]2

l2

= 7.

That is a big jump. From the point of view of integration, it is a limit of sums. From
the point of view of probability, the chance of each outcome is zero but the probability
density at x is p(x) = 1/10. The integral of p(x) is 1, because some outcome must
happen. The integral of xp(x) is x,,, = 7, the expected value. Each choice of x is
random, but the average is predictable.
This completes a first step in probability theory. The second step comes after more
calculus. Decaying probabilities use e-" and e-"'-then
the chance of a large x is
very small. Here we end with the expected values of xn and I/& and l/x, for a
random choice between 0 and 1 (so p(x) = 1):

A CONFUSION ABOUT "EXPECTED" CLASS SIZE

A college can advertise an average class size of 29, while most students are in large
classes most of the time. I will show quickly how that happens.
Suppose there are 95 classes of 20 students and 5 classes of 200 students. The total
enrollment in 100 classes is 1900 + 1000 = 2900. A random professor has expected
class size 29. But a random student sees it differently. The probability is 1900/2900
of being in a small class and 1000/2900 of being in a large class. Adding class size
times probability gives the expected class size for the student:
(20) (E)
+ (200) (IWO)
2900
2900

students in the class.

Similarly, the average waiting time at a restaurant seems like 40 minutes (to the
customer). To the hostess, who averages over the whole day, it is 10 minutes. If you
came at a random time it would be 10, but if you are a random customer it is 40.
Traffic problems could be eliminated by raising the average number of people per
car to 2.5, or even 2. But that is virtually impossible. Part of the problem is the

difference between (a) the percentage of cars with one person and (b) the percentage
of people alone in a car. Percentage (b) is smaller. In practice, most people would be
in crowded cars. See Problems 37-38.

5.7 The Fundamental Theorem and Its Applications
When the endpoints are fixed at a and b, we have a definite integral. When the upper
limit is a variable point x, we have an indefinite integral. More generally: When the
endpoints depend in any way on x, the integral is a function of x. Therefore we can
find its derivative. This requires the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
The essence of the Theorem is: Derivative of integral of v equals v. We also compute
the derivative when the integral goes from a(x) to b(x)-both limits variable.
Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem reverses the order: Integral ofderivative o f f
equals f C . That will follow quickly from Part 1, with help from the Mean Value
Theorem. It is Part 2 that we use most, since integrals are harder than derivatives.
After the proofs we go to new applications, beyond the standard problem of area
under a curve. Integrals can add up rings and triangles and shells-not just rectangles.
The answer can be a volume or a probability-not just an area.

+

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM, PART 1

Start with a continuous function v . Integrate it from a fixed point a to a variable
point x. For each x, this integral f(x) is a number. We do not require or expect a
formula for f (x)-it is the area out to the point x. It is a function of x! The Fundamental Theorem says that this area function has a derivative (another limiting process).
The derivative df ldx equals the original v(x).

5 Integrals

The dummy variable is written as t, so we can concentrate on the limits. The val
of the integral depends on the limits a and x, not on t.
To find df ldx, start with Af =f (x + Ax) -f (x) = diflerence of areas:

v(t) dt.
(1)
Officially, this is Property 1. The area out to x + Ax minus the area out to x equals
~f=

the small part from x to x + Ax. Now divide by Ax:
1 x+Ax
Af--v(t) dt = average value = v(c).
Ax Ax

I

This is Property 7, the Mean Value Theorem for integrals. The average value on this
short interval equals v(c). This point c is somewhere between x and x + Ax (exact
position not known), and we let Ax approach zero. That squeezes c toward x, so v(c)
approaches u(x)-remember that v is continuous. The limit of equation (2) is the
Fundamental Theorem:
Af + d f

and v(c) + u(x)

SO

- = v(x).

If Ax is negative the reasoning still holds. Why assume that v(x) is continuous?
Because if v is a step function, then f (x) has a corner where dfldx is not v(x).
We could skip the Mean Value Theorem and simply bound v above and below:

Fig. 5.14 Fundamental Theorem, Part 1: (thin area Af)/(base length Ax) -+ height u(x).

Graphical meaning The f-graph gives the area under the v-graph. The thin strip in
Figure 5.14, has area Af. That area is approximately v(x) times Ax. Dividing by its
base, AflAx is close to the height v(x). When Ax -* 0 and the strip becomes infinitely
thin, the expression "close to" converges to "equals." Then df ldx is the height at v(x).
DERIVATIVES WITH VARIABLE ENDPOINTS

When the upper limit is x, the derivative is v(x). Suppose the lower limit is x. The
integral goes from x to 6,instead of a to x. When x moves, the lower limit moves.

5.7 The Fundamental Theorem and Its Applications

The change in area is on the left side of Figure 5.15. As x goesforward, area is removed.
So there is a minus sign in the derivative of area:
The derivative of g(x) =

dg = - v(x).
v(t) dt is dx

The quickest proof is to reverse b and x, which reverses the sign (Property 3):
g(x) = -

1'

v(t) dt so by part I dg = - v(x).
dx

Fig. 5.15 Area from x to b has dgldx = - u(x). Area v(b)db is added, area v(a)da is lost

The general case is messier but not much harder (it is quite useful). Suppose both
limits are changing. The upper limit b(x) is not necessarily x, but it depends on x.
The lower limit a(x) can also depend on x (Figure 5.15b). The area A between those
limits changes as x changes, and we want dAldx:
v(t) dt then

dA

-=

v(b(x)) - - v(a(x)) -.

The figure shows two thin strips, one added to the area and one subtracted.
First check the two cases we know. When a = 0 and b = x, we have daldx = 0 and
dbldx = 1. The derivative according to (6) is v(x) times 1-the Fundamental Theorem.
The other case has a = x and b = constant. Then the lower limit in (6) produces - v(x).
When the integral goes from a = 2x to b = x3, its derivative is new:
EXAMPLE 1

A

=

5;:

cos t dt = sin x3 - sin 2x

dAjdx = (cos x3)(3x2)- (cos 2x)(2).
That fits with (6), because dbldx is 3x2 and daldx is 2 (with minus sign). It also looks
like the chain rule-which it is! To prove (6) we use the letters v and f:
A=

~ ( t dt
) =j(h(x)) -f (a(x))

(by Part 2 below)
(by the chain rule)

Since f ' = v, equation (6) is proved. In the next example the area turns out to be
constant, although it seems to depend on x. Note that v(t) = l/t so v(3x) = 1/3x.

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM, PART 2

We have used a hundred times the Theorem that is now to be proved. It is the key
to integration. "The integral of dfldx is f (x) + C." The application starts with v(x).
We search for an f (x) with this derivative. If dfldx = v(x), the Theorem says that

We can't rely on knowing formulas for v and f-only the definitions of and dldx.
The proof rests on one extremely special case: dfldx is the zero function. We easily
find f (x) = constant. The problem is to prove that there are no other possibilities: f '
must be constant. When the slope is zero, the graph must be flat. Everybody knows
this is true, but intuition is not the same as proof.
Assume that df ldx = 0 in an interval. Iff (x) is not constant, there are points where
f (a) # f (b). By the Mean Value Theorem, there is a point c where

f '(c) = (b) -f
b-a

(this is not zero because f (a) # f (b)).

But f '(c) # 0 directly contradicts df ldx = 0. Therefore f (x) must be constant.
Note the crucial role of the Mean Value Theorem. A local hypothesis (dfldx = 0
at each point) yields a global conclusion (f = constant in the whole interval). The
derivative narrows the field of view, the integral widens it. The Mean Value Theorem
connects instantaneous to average, local to global, points to intervals. This special
case (the zero function) applies when A(x) and f(x) have the same derivative:
IfdAldx

= dfldx

on an interval, then A(x) =f(x) + C.

(7)

Reason: The derivative of A(x) -f (x) is zero. So A(x) -f (x) must be constant.
Now comes the big theorem. It assumes that v(x) is continuous, and integrates
using f (x):
5D (Fu~tdamentalTheorem, Part 2) If u(x) =

dx

u(x) dx =f (b) -f (a).

The antiderivative is f (x). But Part 1gave another antiderivative for the same
v(x). It was the integral-constructed from rectangles and now called A(x):

Proof

v(t)dt

dA
alsohas ---=v(x).
dx

Since A' = v and f ' = v, the special case in equation (7) states that A(x) =f (x) + C.
That is the essential point: The integral from rectangles equals f (x) + C.
At the lower limit the area integral is A = 0. So f (a) + C = 0. At the upper limit
j'(b) + C = A(b). Subtract to find A(b), the definite integral:

Calculus is beautiful-its

Fundamental Theorem is also its most useful theorem.

217

5.7 The Fundamental Theorem and Its Applications
Another proof of Part 2 starts with f' = v and looks at subintervals:
f(xi) - f(a) = v(x*)(xi - a)

(by the Mean Value Theorem)

f(x 2) -f(x 1)= V(X2)(X2 - Xi)

(by the Mean Value Theorem)

f(b) - f(x -,) = v(x,*)(b - x, _)

(by the Mean Value Theorem).

The left sides add to f(b) -f(a). The sum on the right, as Ax -- 0, is

J

v(x) dx.

APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION
Up to now the integral has been the area under a curve. There are many other
applications, quite different from areas. Whenever additionbecomes "continuous," we
have integralsinstead of sums. Chapter 8 has space to develop more applications, but
four examples can be given immediately--which will make the point.
We stay with geometric problems, rather than launching into physics or engineering
or biology or economics. All those will come. The goal here is to take a first step
away from rectangles.
EXAMPLE 3 (for circles) The area A and circumference C are related by dA/dr = C.
The question is why. The area is 7r2. Its derivative 27nr is the circumference. By the
Fundamental Theorem, the integral of C is A. What is missing is the geometrical
reason. Certainly rr2 is the integral of 2nrr, but what is the real explanation for A =

J C(r) dr?

My point is that the pieces are not rectangles. We could squeeze rectangles under
a circular curve, but their heights would have nothing to do with C. Our intuition
has to take a completely different direction, and add up the thin rings in Figure 5.16.

shell volume = 4ntr 2Ar
Fig. 5.16 Area of circle = integral over rings. Volume of sphere = integral over shells.

Suppose the ring thickness is Ar. Then the ring area is close to C times Ar. This is
precisely the kind of approximation we need, because its error is of higher order (Ar)2.
The integral adds ring areasjust as it added rectangular areas:
A=

C dr =

2nr dr =

Ir 2 .

That is our first step toward freedom, away from rectangles to rings.

218

5 Integrals

The ring area AA can be checked exactly-it is the difference of circles:
AA = ir(r + Ar) 2 - trr2 = 2rr Ar + 7r(Ar)2 .
This is CAr plus a correction. Dividing both sides by Ar - 0 leaves dA/dr = C.

Finally there is a geometrical reason. The ring unwinds into a thin strip. Its width
is Ar and its length is close to C. The inside and outside circles have different perimeters, so this is not a true rectangle-but the area is near CAr.
EXAMPLE 4

For a sphere, surface area and volume satisfy A = dV/dr.

What worked for circles will work for spheres. The thin rings become thin shells. A
shell goes from radius r to radius r + Ar, so its thickness is Ar. We want the volume
of the shell, but we don't need it exactly. The surface area is 47rr 2 , so the volume is
about 47rr 2 Ar. That is close enough!
Again we are correct except for (Ar)2 . Infinitesimally speaking dV= A dr:
V=

A dr =

4rr2 dr = rr3 .

This is the volume of a sphere. The derivative of V is A, and the shells explain why.
Main point: Integration is not restrictedto rectangles.

EXAMPLE 5 The distance around a square is 4s. Why does the area have dAlds = 2s?
The side is s and the area is s2. Its derivative 2s goes only half way aroundthe square.

I tried to understand that by drawing a figure. Normally this works, but in the figure
dAlds looks like 4s. Something is wrong. The bell is ringing so I leave this as an
exercise.
EXAMPLE6

Find the area under v(x)= cos-

x from x= 0 to x= 1.

That is a conventional problem, but we have no antiderivative for cos- x. We could
look harder, and find one. However there is another solution-unconventional but
correct. The region can be filled with horizontal rectangles (not vertical rectangles).

Figure 5.17b shows a typical strip of length x = cos v (the curve has v = cos'-x). As
the thickness Av approaches zero, the total area becomes x dv. We are integrating

J

upward, so the limits are on v not on x:
area

cos v dv = sin v]-'

5.8 Numerical Integration
This section concentrates on definite integrals. The inputs are y ( x ) and two endpoints
a and b. The output is the integral I. Our goal is to find that number
1; y(x) d x = I, accurately and in a short time. Normally this goal is achievable-as
soon as we have a good method for computing integrals.
Our two approaches so far have weaknesses. The search for an antiderivative
succeeds in important cases, and Chapter 7 extends that range-but generally f ( x )
is not available. The other approach (by rectangles) is in the right direction but too
crude. The height is set by y(x) at the right and left end of each small interval. The
right and left rectangle rules add the areas ( A x times y):

R,=(Ax)(y,+y,+

-.. + y , ) and L n = ( A x ) ( y o + y l + . - -+y,-,).

The value of y(x) at the end of interval j is yj. The extreme left value yo = y(a) enters
L, . With n equal intervals of length A x = ( b - a)/n, the extreme right value is y, =
y(b). It enters R,. Otherwise the sums are the same-simple to compute, easy to
visualize, but very inaccurate.
This section goes from slow methods (rectangles) to better methods (trapezoidal
and midpoint) to good methods (Simpson and Gauss). Each improvement cuts down
the error. You could discover the formulas without the book, by integrating x and

221

5.8 Numerical Integration

x 2 and x 4 . The rule R, would come out on one side of the answer, and L, would be
on the other side. You would figure out what to do next, to come closer to the exact
integral. The book can emphasize one key point:
The quality of a formula depends on how many integrals
1dx, f x dx, f x 2 dx, ..., it computes exactly. If f x Pdx
is the first to be wrong, the order of accuracy is p.

f

By testing the integrals of 1, x, x 2, ..., we decide how accurate the formulas are.
Figure 5.18 shows the rectangle rules R, and L,. They are already wrong when
y = x. These methods are first-order: p = 1. The errors involve the first power of
Ax-where we would much prefer a higher power. A larger p in (Ax) P means a
smaller error.

Fig. 5.18 Errors E and e in R. and L, are the areas of triangles.

When the graph of y(x) is a straight line, the integral I is known. The error triangles
E and e have base Ax. Their heights are the differences yj+ 1 - yj. The areas are
'(base)(height), and the only difference is a minus sign. (L is too low, so the error
L - I is negative.) The total error in R. is the sum of the E's:
R, - I = ½Ax(y - Yo) + -.- + ½Ax(y - yn-_1)=

Ax(y. - yo).

(1)

All y's between Yo and y, cancel. Similarly for the sum of the e's:
L- - I

- ½Ax(Yn - Yo)

=

-

Ax[y(b - y(a)].

(2)

The greater the slope of y(x), the greater the error-since rectangles have zero slope.
Formulas (1) and (2) are nice-but those errors are large. To integrate y = x from
a = 0 to b = 1, the error is ½Ax(1 - 0). It takes 500,000 rectangles to reduce this error
to 1/1,000,000. This accuracy is reasonable, but that many rectangles is unacceptable.
The beauty of the error formulas is that they are "asymptotically correct" for all
functions. When the graph is curved, the errors don't fit exactly into triangles. But
the ratio of predicted error to actual error approaches 1. As Ax -+ 0, the graph is
almost straight in each interval-this is linear approximation.
The error prediction ½Ax[y(b)- y(a)] is so simple that we test it on y(x) = x:

The error decreases along each row. So does Ax = .1, .01, .001, .0001. Multiplying n
by 10 divides Ax by 10. The error is also divided by 10 (almost). The error is nearly
proportional to Ax-typical of first-order methods.
The predicted error is ½Ax, since here y(1) = 1 and y(O) = 0. The computed errors
in the table come closer and closer to ½Ax = .5, .05, .005, .0005. The prediction is the
"leading term" in the actual error.

222

Integrals

The table also shows a curious fact. Subtracting the last row from the row above
gives exact numbers 1, .1, .01, and .001. This is (R, - I) - (L, - I), which is R, - L,.
It comes from an extra rectangle at the right, included in R. but not L,. Its height is
1 and its area is 1, .1, .01, .001.
The errors in R. and L. almost cancel. The average T, = ½(R, + L,) has less errorit is the "trapezoidal rule." First we give the rectangle prediction two final tests:
n= l

Those errors are falling faster than Ax. For y = x - x the prediction explains why:
y(O) equals y(l). The leading term, with y(b) minus y(a), is zero. The exact errors are
'(Ax) 2 , dropping from 10-1 to 10- 3 to 10- 5 to 10- 7 . In these examples L, is identical
to R. (and also to T,), because the end rectangles are the same. We will see these
((Ax) 2 errors in the trapezoidal rule.
The last row in the table is more unusual. It shows practically no error. Why do
the rectangle rules suddenly achieve such an outstanding success?
The reason is that y(x) = 1/(10 + cos 2nrx) is periodic. The leading term in the error
is zero, because y(O) = y(l). Also the next term will be zero, because y'(0) = y'(1). Every
power of Ax is multiplied by zero, when we integrate over a complete period. So the
errors go to zero exponentially fast.
Personalnote I tried to integrate 1/(10 + cos 27rx) by hand and failed. Then I was
embarrassed to discover the answer in my book on applied mathematics. The method
was a special trick using complex numbers, which applies over an exact period.
Finally I found the antiderivative (quite complicated) in a handbook of integrals, and
verified the area 1/-99.
THE TRAPEZOIDAL AND MIDPOINT RULES

We move to integration formulas that are exact when y = x. They have secondorder accuracy. The Ax error term disappears. The formulas give the correct area
under straight lines. The predicted error is a multiple of (Ax) 2. That multiple is found
by testing y = x 2 -for which the answers are not exact.
The first formula combines R. and L,. To cancel as much error as possible, take
the average !(R, + L,). This yields the trapezoidal rule, which approximates
Sy(x) dx by Tn:

5.8 Numerical Intqrdon

The base is Ax and the sides have heights yj-l and yj. Adding those areas gives
+(L, + R,) in formula (3)-the coefficients of yj combine into f + f = 1. Only the first
and last intervals are missing a neighbor, so the rule has f yo and f y,. Because
trapezoids (unlike rectangles) fit under a sloping line, T,, is exact when y = x.
What is the difference from rectangles? The trapezoidal rule gives weight f Ax to
yo and y,. The rectangle rule R, gives full weight Ax to y, (and no weight to yo).
R, - T, is exactly the leading error f y, - +yo.The change to T,, knocks out that error.
Another important formula is exact for y(x) = x. A rectangle has the same area as
a trapezoid, if the height of the rectangle is halfway between yj- and yj . On a straight
line graph that is achieved at the midpoint of the interval. By evaluating y(x) at the
halfway points f Ax, AX, AX, ..., we get much better rectangles. This leads to the
midpoint rule M n:
For

1; x dx, trapezoids give f (0)+ 1 + 2 + 3 + f(4) = 8. The midpoint rule gives

4 + 4 +3 + 3 = 8, again correct. The rules become different when y = x2, because y,,,
is no longer the average of yo and y,. Try both second-order rules on x2:

n=

The errors fall by 100 when n is multiplied by 10. The midpoint rule is twice as good
(- 1/12 vs. 116). Since all smooth functions are close to parabolas (quadratic approximation in each interval), the leading errors come from Figure 5.19. The trapezoidal
error is exactly
when y(x) is x2 (the 12 in the formula divides the 2 in y'):

For exact error formulas, change yt(b)- yt(a) to (b - a)yM(c).The location of c is
unknown (as in the Mean Value Theorem). In practice these formulas are not much
used-they involve the pth derivative at an unknown location c. The main point
about the error is the factor AX)^.
One crucial fact is easy to overlook in our tests. Each value of y(x) can be extremely
hard to compute. Every time a formula asks for yj, a computer calls a subroutine. The
goal of numerical integration is to get below the error tolerance, while calling for a
minimum number of values of y. Second-order rules need about a thousand values for
a typical tolerance of
The next methods are better.
FOURTH-ORDER RULE: SIMPSON

The trapezoidal error is nearly twice the midpoint error (116 vs. - 1/12). So a
good combination will have twice as much of M, as T,. That is Simpson's rule:

Multiply the midpoint values by 213 = 416. The endpoint values are multiplied by

2/6, except at the far ends a and b (with heights Yo and y,). This 1-4-2-4-2-4-1
pattern has become famous.
Simpson's rule goes deeper than a combination of T and M. It comes from a
parabolic approximation to y(x) in each interval. When a parabola goes through yo,
Yl/2, yl, the area under it is !Ax(yo + 4 yl/2+ YI). This is S over the first interval. All
our rules are constructed this way: Integrate correctly as many powers 1, x, x 2,

possible. Parabolas are better than straight lines, which are better than flat pieces.
S beats M, which beats R. Check Simpson's rule on powers of x, with Ax = 1/n:

Exact answers for x 2 are no surprise. S, was selected to get parabolas right. But the
zero errors for x3 were not expected. The accuracy has jumped to fourth order, with
errors proportional to (Ax)4 . That explains the popularity of Simpson's rule.
To understand why x3 is integrated exactly, look at the interval [-1, 1]. The odd

THE GAUSS RULE (OPTIONAL)

We need a competitor for Simpson, and Gauss can compete with anybody. He
calculated integrals in astronomy, and discovered that two points are enough for a
fourth-order method. From -1 to 1 (a single interval) his rule is
I_ y(x) dx ?%y(- 1//3) + y(1/-,3).

(9)

Those "Gauss points" x = - 1/,3 and x = 1/,3 can be found directly. By placing

them symmetrically, all odd powers x, x 3, ... are correctly integrated. The key is in
y = x 2 , whose integral is 2/3. The Gauss points - x, and + XG get this integral right:

DEFINITE INTEGRALS ON A CALCULATOR

It is fascinating to know how numerical integration is actually done. The points are
not equally spaced! For an integral from 0 to 1, Hewlett-Packard machines might
internally replace x by 3u2 - 2u3 (the limits on u are also 0 and 1). The machine
remembers to change dx. For example,

:1 5

becomes

Algebraically that looks worse-but the infinite value of l/& at x = 0 disappears
at u = 0. The differential 6(u - u2) du was chosen to vanish at u = 0 and u = 1. We
don't need y(x) at the endpoints-where infinity is most common. In the u variable
the integration points are equally spaced-therefore in x they are not.
When a difficult point is inside [a, b], break the interval in two pieces. And chop
off integrals that go out to infinity. The integral of e p x 2should be stopped by
x = 10, since the tail is so thin. (It is bad to go too far.) Rapid oscillations are among
the toughest- the answer depends on cancellation of highs and lows, and the calculator requires many integration points.
The change from x to u affects periodic functions. I thought equal spacing was
good, since 1/(10+ cos 2nx) was integrated above to enormous accuracy. But there
is a danger called aliasing. If sin 8nx is sampled with Ax = 118, it is always zero. A
high frequency 8 is confused with a low frequency 0 (its "alias" which agrees at the
sample points). With unequal spacing the problem disappears. Notice how any integration method can be deceived:
Ask for the integral of y = 0 and specify the accuracy. The calculator
samples y at x,, . . ., x,. (With a PAUSE key, the x's may be displayed.)
Then integrate Y(x) = (x - x , ) ~ (x - x , ) ~ . That also returns the
answer zero (now wrong), because the calculator follows the same steps.
On the HP-28s you enter the function, the endpoints, and the accuracy. The
variable x can be named or not (see the margin). The outputs 4.67077 and 4.7E-5 are
the requested integral ex dx and the estimated error bound. Your input accuracy

In consulting for HP, William Kahan chose formulas using 1, 3, 7, 15, ... sample
points. Each new formula uses the samples in the previous formula. The calculator
stops when answers are close. The last paragraphs are based on Kahan's work.

Exponentials and Logarithms

This chapter is devoted to exponentials like 2" and 10" and above all ex. The goal is
to understand them, differentiate them, integrate them, solve equations with them,
and invert them (to reach the logarithm). The overwhelming importance of ex makes
this a crucial chapter in pure and applied mathematics.
In the traditional order of calculus books, ex waits until other applications of the
integral are complete. I would like to explain why it is placed earlier here. I believe
that the equation dyldx = y has to be emphasized above techniques of integration.
The laws of nature are expressed by drflerential equations, and at the center is ex. Its
applications are to life sciences and physical sciences and economics and engineering
(and more-wherever change is influenced by the present state). The model produces
a differential equation and I want to show what calculus can do.
The key is always bm+"= (bm)(b3.Section 6.1 applies that rule in three ways:
1. to understand the logarithm as the exponent;
2. to draw graphs on ordinary and semilog and log-log paper;
3. to find derivatives. The slope of b" will use bX+*"= (bx)(bh").

6.1 An Overview
There is a good chance you have met logarithms. They turn multiplication into
addition, which is a lot simpler. They are the basis for slide rules (not so important)
and for graphs on log paper (very important). Logarithms are mirror images of
exponentials-and those I know you have met.
Start with exponentials. The numbers 10 and lo2 and lo3 are basic to the decimal
system. For completeness I also include lo0, which is "ten to the zeroth power" or
1. The logarithms of those numbers are the exponents. The logarithms of 1 and 10 and
100 and 1000 are 0 and 1 and 2 and 3. These are logarithms "to base 10,"because
the powers are powers of 10.
Question When the base changes from 10 to b, what is the logarithm of l ?
Since b0 = 1, logJ is always zero. To base b, the logarithm of bn is n.
Answer

6.1 An Overview

Negative powers are also needed. The number 10x is positive, but its exponent x can
be negative. The first examples are 1/10 and 1/100, which are the same as 10-' and
10- 2 . The logarithms are the exponents -1 and -2:
1000 = 103

1/1000 = 10-

3

and

log 1000 = 3

and

log 1/1000 = - 3.

Multiplying 1000 times 1/1000 gives 1 = 100. Adding logarithms gives 3 + (- 3) = 0.
Always 10m times 10" equals 10" +" .In particular 103 times 102 produces five tens:
(10)(10)(10) times (10)(10) equals (10)(10)(10)(10)(10) = 105.
The law for b" times b" extends to all exponents, as in 104.6 times 10'. Furthermore
the law applies to all bases (we restrict the base to b > 0 and b - 1). In every case
multiplication of numbers is addition of exponents.
6A

bm times b" equals b'",so logarithms (exponents) add
b' divided by b" equals b", so logarithms (exponents) subtract
logb(yZ) = lOgby + lOgbz

and

(1)

logb(Y/Z) = lOgby - lOgbz.

Historical note In the days of slide rules, 1.2 and 1.3 were multiplied by sliding
one edge across to 1.2 and reading the answer under 1.3. A slide rule made in
Germany would give the third digit in 1.56. Its photograph shows the numbers on a
log scale. The distance from 1 to 2 equals the distance from 2 to 4 and from 4 to 8.

By sliding the edges, you add distances and multiply numbers.
Division goes the other way. Notice how 1000/10 = 100 matches 3 - 1 = 2. To divide
1.56 by 1.3, look back along line D for the answer 1.2.
The second figure, though smaller, is the important one. When x increases by 1, 2 x
is multiplied by 2. Adding to x multiplies y. This rule easily gives y = 1, 2, 4, 8, but
look ahead to calculus-which doesn't stay with whole numbers.
Calculus will add Ax. Then y is multiplied by 2ax. This number is near 1. If
ax 1.07-the tenth root of 2. To find the slope, we have to consider
Ax = A then 2"
(2 ax - 1)/Ax. The limit is near (1.07 - 1)/- = .7, but the exact number will take time.

6 Exponentials and Logarithms

Base Change Bases other than 10 and exponents other than 1,2,3, ... are needed
for applications. The population of the world x years from now is predicted to grow
by a factor close to 1.02". Certainly x does not need to be a whole number of years.
And certainly the base 1.02 should not be 10 (or we are in real trouble). This prediction
will be refined as we study the differential equations for growth. It can be rewritten
to base 10 if that is preferred (but look at the exponent):

1.02" is the same as

10('Og .02)".

When the base changes from 1.02 to 10, the exponent is multiplied-as we now see.
For practice, start with base b and change to base a. The logarithm to base a will
be written "log." Everything comes from the rule that logarithm = exponent:
base change for numbers: b = d o g b .

Now raise both sides to the power x. You see the change in the exponent:
base change for exponentials: bx = a('0g,Ix.
Finally set y = bX.Its logarithm to base b is x. Its logarithm to base a is the exponent
on the right hand side: logay = (log,b)x. Now replace x by logby:
base change for logarithms: log, y = (log, b) (log, y ).

We absolutely need this ability to change the base. An example with a = 2 is
b = 8 = Z3

g2 = (z3), = 26

log, 64 = 3 2 = (log28)(log864).

The rule behind base changes is (am)"= am". When the mth power is raised to the
xth power, the exponents multiply. The square of the cube is the sixth power:

(a)(a)(a)times (a)(a)(a) equals (a)(a)(a)(a)(a)(a): (a3),=a6.
Another base will soon be more important than 10-here
changes:

are the rules for base

The first is the definition. The second is the xth power of the first. The third is the
logarithm of the second (remember y is bx). An important case is y = a:
log, a = (log, b)(logba) = 1 so log, b = 1/log, a.
EXAMPLE

(3)

8 = 23 means 8lI3 = 2. Then (10g28)(l0g82)= (3)(1/3) = 1.

This completes the algebra of logarithms. The addition rules 6A came from
(bm)(b")= bm+".The multiplication rule 68 came from (am)"= am". We still need to
deJine b" and ax for all real numbers x. When x is a fraction, the definition is easy.
The square root of a8 is a4 (m = 8 times x = 112). When x is not a fraction, as in 2",
the graph suggests one way to fill in the hole.
We could defne 2" as the limit of 23, 231110,23141100,
... . As the fractions r approach
7t, the powers 2' approach 2". This makes y = 2" into a continuous function, with the
m and n and x are intedesired properties (2")(2") = 2"'" and (2")" = 2""-whether
gers or not. But the E'S and 6's of continuity are not attractive, and we eventually
choose (in Section 6.4) a smoother approach based on integrals.

GRAPHS OF b" AND logby

It is time to draw graphs. In principle one graph should do the job for both functions,
because y = bx means the same as x = logby. These are inverse functions. What one
function does, its inverse undoes. The logarithm of g(x) = bXis x:
In the opposite direction, the exponential of the logarithm of y is y:
g(g = b('08b~)
=
Y.

(9

This holds for every base b, and it is valuable to see b = 2 and b = 4 on the same
graph. Figure 6.2a shows y = 2" and y = 4". Their mirror images in the 45" line give
the logarithms to base 2 and base 4, which are in the right graph.
When x is negative, y = bx is still positive. If the first graph is extended to the left,
it stays above the x axis. Sketch it in with your pencil. Also extend the second graph
down, to be the mirror image. Don't cross the vertical axis.

Fig. 6.2 Exponentials and mirror images (logarithms). Different scales for x and y.

There are interesting relations within the left figure. All exponentials start at 1,
because b0 is always 1. At the height y = 16, one graph is above x = 2 (because 4' =
16). The other graph is above x = 4 (because 24 = 16). Why does 4" in one graph equal
2," in the other? This is the base change for powers, since 4 = 2,.
The figure on the right shows the mirror image-the logarithm. All logarithms
start from zero at y = 1. The graphs go down to - co at y = 0. (Roughly speaking
2-" is zero.) Again x in one graph corresponds to 2x in the other (base change for
logarithms). Both logarithms climb slowly, since the exponentials climb so fast.
The number log, 10 is between 3 and 4, because 10 is between 23 and 24. The slope
of 2" is proportional to 2"-which never happened for xn. But there are two practical
difficulties with those graphs:
1. 2" and 4" increase too fast. The curves turn virtually straight up.
2. The most important fact about Ab" is the value of 6-and the base
doesn't stand out in the graph.

There is also another point. In many problems we don't know the function y =
f(x). We are looking for it! All we have are measured values of y (with errors mixed
in). When the values are plotted on a graph, we want to discover f(x).
Fortunately there is a solution. Scale the y axis dfferently. On ordinary graphs,
each unit upward adds a fixed amount to y. On a log scale each unit multiplies y by

6 Exponentials and Logarithms

aJixed amount. The step from y = 1 to y = 2 is the same length as the step from 3 to
6 or 10 to 20.
On a log scale, y = 11 is not halfway between 10 and 12. And y = 0 is not there at
all. Each step down divides by a fixed amount-we never reach zero. This is completely satisfactory for Abx, which also never reaches zero.
Figure 6.3 is on semilog paper (also known as log-linear), with an ordinary x axis.
The graph of y = Abx is a straight line. To see why, take logarithms of that equation:
log y = log A + x log b.

(6)

The relation between x and log y is linear. It is really log y that is plotted, so the graph
is straight. The markings on the y axis allow you to enter y without looking up its
logarithm-you get an ordinary graph of log y against x.
Figure 6.3 shows two examples. One graph is an exact plot of y = 2 loX.It goes
upward with slope 1, because a unit across has the same length as multiplication by
10 going up. lox has slope 1 and 10("gb)" (which is bx) will have slope log b. The
crucial number log b can be measured directly as the slope.

Fig. 6.3 2 = 10" and 4 10-"I2 on semilog paper. Fig. 6.4 Graphs of AX^ on log-log paper.

The second graph in Figure 6.3 is more typical of actual practice, in which we start
with measurements and look for f(x). Here are the data points:

We don't know in advance whether these values fit the model y = Abx. The graph is
strong evidence that they do. The points lie close to a line with negative slopeindicating log b < 0 and b < 1. The slope down is half of the earlier slope up, so the

6.1 An Overview

model is consistent with
y = Ado-X12 or log y = l o g A - f x .

(7)

When x reaches 2, y drops by a factor of 10. At x = 0 we see A z 4.
Another model-a power y = Axk instead of an exponential-also stands out with
logarithmic scaling. This time we use log-log paper, with both axes scaled. The
logarithm of y = Axk gives a linear relation between log y and log x:
log y = log A

+ k log x.

(8)

The exponent k becomes the slope on log-log paper. The base b makes no difference.
We just measure the slope, and a straight line is a lot more attractive than a power
curve.
The graphs in Figure 6.4 have slopes 3 and and - 1. They represent Ax3 and
A& and Alx. To find the A's, look at one point on the line. At x = 4 the height is
8, so adjust the A's to make this happen: The functions are x3/8 and 4& and 32/x.
On semilog paper those graphs would not be straight!
You can buy log paper or create it with computer graphics.

THE DERIVATIVES OF y = bxAND x= log,y

This is a calculus book. We have to ask about slopes. The algebra of exponents is
done, the rules are set, and on log paper the graphs are straight. Now come limits.
The central question is the derivative. What is dyldx when y = bx? What is dxldy
when x is the logarithm logby? Thpse questions are closely related, because bx and
logby are inverse functions. If one slope can be found, the other is known from
dxldy = l/(dy/dx). The problem is to find one of them, and the exponential comes
first.
You will now see that those questions have quick (and beautiful) answers, except
for a mysterious constant. There is a multiplying factor c which needs more time. I
think it is worth separating out the part that can be done immediately, leaving c in
dyldx and llc in dxldy. Then Section 6.2 discovers c by studying the special number
called e (but c # e).

I

6C The derivative of bX is a multiple ebx. The number c depends on the
base b.

I

The product and power and chain rules do not yield this derivative. We are pushed
all the way back to the original definition, the limit of AylAx:

Key idea: Split bx+hinto bXtimes bh. Then the crucial quantity bx factors out. More
than that, bx comes outside the limit because it does not depend on h. The remaining
limit, inside the brackets, is the number c that we don't yet know:

This equation is central to the whole chapter: dyldx equals cbx which equals cy. The
rate of change of y is proportional to y. The slope increases in the same way that bx
increases (except for the factor c). A typical example is money in a bank, where

6 Exponentials and Logarithms

interest is proportional to the principal. The rich get richer, and the poor get slightly
richer. We will come back to compound interest, and identify b and c.
The inverse function is x = logby. Now the unknown factor is l/c:

I 6D
Proof

I

The slope of logby is llcy with the same e (depending on b).
If dy/dx = cbx then dxldy = l/cbx = llcy.

(11)

That proof was like a Russian toast, powerful but too quick! We go more carefully:
(logarithm of exponential)

f(bx) = x

(x derivative by chain rule)

f '(bx)(cbx)= 1

f '(bx) = l/cbx (divide by cbx)

f '(y) = l/cy

(identify bx as y)

The logarithm gives another way to find c. From its slope we can discover l/c. This
is the way that finally works (next section).

Final remark It is extremely satisfying to meet an f(y) whose derivative is llcy.
At last the " - 1 power" has an antiderivative. Remember that j'xndx = xn+'/(n 1)
is a failure when n = - 1. The derivative of x0 (a constant) does not produce x-'.

6 Exponentials and Logarithms

6.2 The Exponential eX
The last section discussed bx and logby. The base b was arbitrary-it could be 2 or 6
or 9.3 or any positive number except 1. But in practice, only a few bases are used.
I have never met a logarithm to base 6 or 9.3. Realistically there are two leading
candidates for b, and 10 is one of them. This section is about the other one, which is
an extremely remarkable number. This number is not seen in arithmetic or algebra
or geometry, where it looks totally clumsy and out of place. In calculus it comes into
its own.
The number is e. That symbol was chosen by Euler (initially in a fit of selfishness,
but he was a wonderful mathematician). It is the base of the natural logarithm.
It also controls the exponential ex, which is much more important than In x.
Euler also chose 7c to stand for perimeter-anyway, our first goal is to find e.
Remember that the derivatives of bx and logby include a constant c that depends
on b. Equations (10) and (1 1) in the previous section were

and

CY

At x = 0, the graph of bx starts from b0 = 1. The slope is c. At y = 1, the graph of
logby starts from logbl = 0. The logarithm has slope llc. With the right choice of the
base b those slopes will equal 1 (because c will equal 1).
For y = 2" the slope c is near .7. We already tried Ax = .1 and found Ay z -07. The
base has to be larger than 2, for a starting slope of c = 1.
We begin with a direct computation of the slope of logby at y = 1:
1

- = slope
C

at 1 = lim - [logb(l
h+O h

+ h) - logbl] = hlim
logb[(l + h)'lh].
-0

Always logbl = 0. The fraction in the middle is logb(l + h) times the number l/h. This
number can go up into the exponent, and it did.
The quantity (1 + h)'Ih is unusual, to put it mildly. As h + 0, the number 1 h is
approaching 1. At the same time, l/h is approaching infinity. In the limit we have
1". But that expression is meaningless (like 010). Everything depends on the
balance bet.ween "nearly 1" and "nearly GO." This balance produces the extraordinary
number e:

+

DEFINITION The number e is equal to lim (1 +'h)'lh. Equivalently e = lim
h+O

n+ co

Before computing e, look again at the slope llc. At the end of equation (2) is the
logarithm of e:
When the base is b = e, the slope is logee = 1. That base e has c = 1 as desired
1

The derivative of ex is 1 ex and the derivative of log,y is 1 my'

(4)

This is why the base e is all-important in calculus. It makes c = 1.
To compute the actual number e from (1 + h)'lh, choose h = 1, 1/10, 1/100, ... . Then
the exponents l/h are n = 1, 10, 100, .... (All limits and derivatives will become official
in Section 6.4.) The table shows (1 + h)lih approaching e as h -,0 and n -, oo:

6.2 The Exponential eX

The last column is converging to e (not quickly). There is an infinite series that
converges much faster. We know 125,000 digits of e (and a billion digits of n). There
are no definite patterns, although you might think so from the first sixteen digits:
e = 2.7 1828 1828 45 90 45 .-. (and lle z .37).
The powers of e produce y = ex. At x = 2.3 and 5, we are close to y = 10 and 150.
The logarithm is the inversefunction. The logarithms of 150 and 10, to the base e,
are close to x = 5 and x = 2.3. There is a special name for this logarithm--the natural
logarithm. There is also a special notation "ln" to show that the base is e:
In y means the same as log,y. The natural logarithm is the exponent in ex = y.
The notation In y (or In x-it is the function that matters, not the variable) is standard
in calculus courses. After calculus, the base is generally assumed to be e. In most of
science and engineering, the natural logarithm is the automatic choice. The symbol
"exp (x)" means ex, and the truth is that the symbol "log x" generally means In x.
Base e is understood even without the letters In. But in any case of doubt-on a
calculator key for example-the symbol "ln x" emphasizes that the base is e.
THE DERIVATIVES OF ex AND In x

Come back to derivatives and slopes. The derivative of bx is cbx, and the derivative
of log, y is llcy. If b = e then c = 1 . For all bases, equation (3) is llc = logbe.
This gives c-the slope of bx at x = 0:

c = In b is the mysterious constant that was not available earlier. The slope of 2" is
In 2 times 2". The slope of ex is In e times ex (but In e = 1). We have the derivatives
on which this chapter depends:

6 Exponentials and Logarithms

Remark on slopes at x = 0: It would be satisfying to see directly that the slope of 2"
is below 1, and the slope of 4" is above 1. Quick proof: e is between 2 and 4.
But the idea is to see the slopes graphically. This is a small puzzle, which is fun to
solve but can be skipped.
2" rises from 1 at x = 0 to 2 at x = 1. On that interval its average slope is 1. Its
slope at the beginning is smaller than average, so it must be less than 1-as desired.
On the other hand 4" rises from at x = - to 1 at x = 0. Again the average slope
is L/L = 1. Since x = 0 comes at the end of this new interval, the slope of 4" at that
point exceeds 1. Somewhere between 2" and 4" is ex, which starts out with slope 1.

:

,,

This is the graphical approach to e. There is also the infinite series, and a fifth
definition through integrals which is written here for the record:

1. e is the number such that ex has slope 1 at x = 0
2. e is the base for which In y = log,y has slope 1 at y = 1

:r

3. e is the limit of 1 + - as n -, co

(

5. the area

5; x - l

dx equals 1.

The connections between 1, 2, and 3 have been made. The slopes are 1 when e is the
limit of (1 + lln)". Multiplying this out wlll lead to 4, the infinite series in Section 6.6.
The official definition of in x comes from 1dxlx, and then 5 says that in e = 1. This
approach to e (Section 6.4) seems less intuitive than the others.
Figure 6.6b shows the graph of e-". It is the mirror image of ex across the vertical
axis. Their product is eXe-" = 1. Where ex grows exponentially, e-" decays
exponentially-or it grows as x approaches - co. Their growth and decay are faster
than any power of x. Exponential growth is more rapid than polynomial growth, so
that e"/xn goes to infinity (Problem 59). It is the fact that ex has slope ex which keeps
the function climbing so fast.

Fig. 6.6 ex grows between 2" and 4". Decay of e-", faster decay of e-"'I2.

The other curve is y = e-"'I2. This is the famous "bell-shaped curve" of probability
it gives the normal distribution, which applies to so
theory. After dividing by
many averages and so many experiments. The Gallup Poll will be an example in
Section 8.4. The curve is symmetric around its mean value x = 0, since changing x to
- x has no effect on x2.
About two thirds of the area under this curve is between x = - 1 and x = 1. If you
pick points at random below the graph, 213 of all samples are expected in that
interval. The points x = - 2 and x = 2 are "two standard deviations" from the center,

EXAMPLE 1 The derivative of e3 x is 3e3 x (here c = 3). The derivative of esinx is
esin x cos x (here u = sin x). The derivative of f(u(x)) is df/du times du/dx. Here
f= e"so df/du = e". The chain rule demands that secondfactor du/dx.
EXAMPLE 2 e(In 22)x is the same as 2x. Its derivative is In2 times 2x. The chain rule
rediscovers our constant c = In 2. In the slope of bx it rediscovers the factor c = Inb.
Generally ecx is preferred to the original bx. The derivative just brings down the
constant c. It is better to agree on e as the base, and put all complications (like c =
Inb) up in the exponent. The second derivative of ecx is c2ecx.
EXAMPLE 3 The derivative of e-x2/2 is - xe -x

Notice how the exponential survives. With every derivative it is multiplied by more
factors, but it is still there to dominate growth or decay. The points of inflection,
where the bell-shaped curve hasf" = 0 in equation (10), are x = 1 and x = - 1.
" n is x"in disguise,

its slope must be nx -1:

This slope is correctfor all n, integer or not. Chapter 2 produced 3x2 and 4x 3 from
the binomial theorem. Now nx"- 1 comes from Inand exp and the chain rule.

INTEGRALS OF e" AND e" du/dx

The first one has c = 2. The second has c = In b-remember again that bx = e('nb)x.
The integral divides by In b. In the third one, e3("+')is e3" times the number e3 and
that number is carried along. Or more likely we see e3'"+'I as eu. The missing du/dx =
3 is fixed by dividing by 3. The last example fails because duldx is not there. We
cannot integrate without duldx:

Here are three examples with du/dx and one without it:

The first is a pure eudu. So is the second. The third has u =
and du/dx = l/2&,
so only the factor 2 had to be fixed. The fourth example does not belong with the
others. It is the integral of du/u2, not the integral of eudu. I don't know any way to
tell you which substitution is best-except that the complicated part is 1 + ex and it
is natural to substitute u. If it works, good.
Without an extra ex for duldx, the integral dx/(l +
looks bad. But u = 1 + ex
is still worth trying. It has du = exdx = (u - 1)dx:

5

That last step is "partial fractions.'' The integral splits into simpler pieces (explained
in Section 7.4) and we integrate each piece. Here are three other integrals:

5

The first can change to - eudu/u2,which is not much better. (It is just as impossible.)
The second is actually J u d u , but I prefer a split: 54ex and 5e2" are safer to do
separately. The third is (4e-" + l)dx, which also separates. The exercises offer practice in reaching eudu/dx - ready to be integrated.

Warning about dejinite integrals When the lower limit is x = 0, there is a natural
tendency to expect f(0) = 0-in which case the lower limit contributes nothing. For
a power f = x3 that is true. For an exponential f = e3" it is definitely not true, because
f(0) = 1:

6.3 Growth and Decay in Science and Economics
The derivative of y = e" has taken time and effort. The result was y' = cecx, which
means that y' = cy. That computation brought others with it, virtually for free-the
derivatives of bx and x x and eu(x).But I want to stay with y' = cy-which is the most
important differential equatibn in applied mathematics.
Compare y' = x with y' = y. The first only asks for an antiderivative of x . We quickly
find y = i x 2 + C. The second has dyldx equal to y itself-which we rewrite as dy/y =
d x . The integral is in y = x + C. Then y itself is exec. Notice that the first solution is
$x2 plus a constant, and the second solution is ex times a constant.
There is a way to graph slope x versus slope y. Figure 6.7 shows "tangent arrows,"
which give the slope at each x and y. For parabolas, the arrows grow steeper as x

and y' = y. The solution curves fit those slopes.

243

6.3 Growth and Decay in Science and Economics
grows-because y' = slope = x. For exponentials, the arrows grow steeper as y
grows-the equation is y'= slope = y. Now the arrows are connected by y = Aex.
A differential equation gives afield of arrows (slopes). Its solution is a curve that stays
tangent to the arrows - then the curve has the right slope.
A field of arrows can show many solutions at once (this comes in a differential
equations course). Usually a single Yo is not sacred. To understand the equation we
start from many yo-on the left the parabolas stay parallel, on the right the heights
stay proportional. For y' = - y all solution curves go to zero.
From y' = y it is a short step to y' = cy. To make c appear in the derivative, put c
into the exponent. The derivative of y = ecx is cecx, which is c times y. We have reached
the key equation, which comes with an initial condition-a starting value yo:
(1)

dy/dt = cy with y = Yo at t = 0.

A small change: x has switched to t. In most applications time is the natural variable,
rather than space. The factor c becomes the "growth rate" or "decay rate"-and ecx
converts to ect.
The last step is to match the initial condition. The problem requires y = Yo at
t = 0. Our ec' starts from ecO = 1. The constant of integration is needed now-the
solutions are y = Ae". By choosing A = Yo, we match the initial condition and solve
equation (1). The formula to remember is yoec'.
61 The exponential law y = yoec' solves y' = cy starting from yo.
The rate of growth or decay is c. May I call your attention to a basic fact? The
formula yoec' contains three quantities Yo, c, t. If two of them are given, plus one
additional piece of information, the third is determined. Many applications have one
of these three forms: find t, find c, find yo.
1. Find the doubling time T if c = 1/10. At that time yoecT equals 2yo:
In 2

e T = 2 yields cT= In 2 so that T= I

--.

(2)

The question asks for an exponent T The answer involves logarithms. If a cell grows
at a continuous rate of c = 10% per day, it takes about .7/.1 = 7 days to double in
size. (Note that .7 is close to In 2.) If a savings account earns 10% continuous interest,
it doubles in 7 years.
In this problem we knew c. In the next problem we know T
2. Find the decay constant c for carbon-14 if y = ½yo in T= 5568 years.
ecr = 4 yields cT= In I so that c (In 5)/5568.

(3)
After the half-life T= 5568, the factor e T equals 4. Now c is negative (In = - In 2).
Question 1 was about growth. Question 2 was about decay. Both answers found
ecT as the ratio y(T)/y(O). Then cT is its logarithm. Note how c sticks to T.
T has the units of time, c has the units of "1/time."
Main point: The doubling time is (In 2)/c, because cT= In 2. The time to multiply
by e is 1/c. The time to multiply by 10 is (In 10)/c. The time to divide by e is - 1/c,
when a negative c brings decay.

3. Find the initial value Yo if c = 2 and y(l) = 5:
y(t) = yoec' yields Yo = y(t)e - c = 5e-2

All we do is run the process backward. Start from 5 and go back to yo. With time
reversed, ect becomes e-". The product of e2 and e-2 is 1-growth forward and
decay backward.
Equally important is T + t. Go forward to time Tand go on to T + t:
y(T+ t) is yoec(T+t)
which is (yoecT)ect.

(4)

Every step t, at the start or later, multiplies by the same ect.This uses the fundamental
property of exponentials, that eT+'= eTet.
EXAMPLE 1 Population growth from birth rate b and death rate d (both constant):

dyldt = by - dy = cy (the net rate is c = b - d).
The population in this model is yoect= yoebte-dt.It grows when b > d (which makes
c > 0). One estimate of the growth rate is c = 0.02/year:
In2

The earth's population doubles in about T = -x - = 35 years.
c
.02
First comment: We predict the future based on c. We count the past population
to find c. Changes in c are a serious problem for this model.
Second comment: yoectis not a whole number. You may prefer to think of bacteria
instead of people. (This section begins a major application of mathematics to economics
and the life sciences.) Malthus based his theory of human population on this equation
y' = cy-and with large numbers a fraction of a person doesn't matter so much. To
use calculus we go from discrete to continuous. The theory must fail when t is very
large, since populations cannot grow exponentially forever. Section 6.5 introduces the
logistic equation y' = cy - by2, with a competition term - by2 to slow the growth.
Third comment: The dimensions of b, c, d are "l/time." The dictionary gives birth
rate = number of births per person in a unit of time. It is a relative rate-people
divided by people and time. The product ct is dimensionless and ectmakes sense (also
dimensionless). Some texts replace c by 1- (lambda). Then 1/A is the growth time or
decay time or drug elimination time or diffusion time.

EXAMPLE 2 Radioactive dating A gram of charcoal from the cave paintings in
France gives 0.97 disintegrations per minute. A gram of living wood gives 6.68 disintegrations per minute. Find the age of those Lascaux paintings.
The charcoal stopped adding radiocarbon when it was burned (at t = 0). The
amount has decayed to yoect.In living wood this amount is still yo, because cosmic

rays maintain the balance. Their ratio is ect= 0.97/6.68. Knowing the decay rate c

EXAMPLE 3 Calculus in Economics: price inflation and the value of money

We begin with two inflation rates - a continuous rate and an annual rate. For the
price change Ay over a year, use the annual rate:
Ay = (annual rate) times (y) times (At).

(5)

Calculus applies the continuous rate to each instant dt. The price change is dy:
k

dy = (continuous rate) times (y) times (dt).

(6)

Dividing by dt, this is a differential equation for the price:
dyldt = (continuous rate) times (y) = .05y.
The solution is yoe.05'.Set t = 1. Then emo5= 1.0513 and the annual rate is 5.13%.
When you ask a bank what interest they pay, they give both rates: 8% and 8.33%.
The higher one they call the "effective rate." It comes from compounding (and depends
how often they do it). If the compounding is continuous, every dt brings an increase
of dy-and eeo8is near 1.0833.
Section 6.6 returns to compound interest. The interval drops from a month to a
day to a second. That leads to (1 + lln)", and in the limit to e. Here we compute the
effect of 5% continuous interest:
Future value A dollar now has the same value as esoSTdollars in T years.
Present value A dollar in T years has the same value as e--OSTdollars now.
Doubling time Prices double (emosT= 2) in T= In 21.05 x 14 years.
With no compounding, the doubling time is 20 years. Simple interest adds on 20
times 5% = 100%. With continuous compounding the time is reduced by the factor
In 2 z -7, regardless of the interest rate.
EXAMPLE 4 In 1626 the Indians sold Manhattan for $24. Our calculations indicate
that they knew what they were doing. Assuming 8% compound interest, the original
$24 is multiplied by e.08'. After t = 365 years the multiplier is e29.2and the $24 has
grown to 115 trillion dollars. With that much money they could buy back the land
and pay off the national debt.
This seems farfetched. Possibly there is a big flaw in the model. It is absolutely
true that Ben Franklin left money to Boston and Philadelphia, to be invested for 200
years. In 1990 it yielded millions (not trillions, that takes longer). Our next step is a
new model.

6 Exponentlals and Logarithms

Question How can you estimate e2'm2 with a $24 calculator (log but not In)?
Answer Multiply 29.2 by loglo e = .434 to get 12.7. This is the exponent to base 10.
After that base change, we have
or more than a trillion.
GROWTH OR DECAY WlTH A SOURCE TERM

The equation y' = y will be given a new term. Up to now, all growth or decay has
started from yo. No deposit or withdrawal was made later. The investment grew by
itself-a pure exponential. The new term s allows you to add or subtract from the
account. It is a "source"-or a "sink" if s is negative. The source s = 5 adds 5dt,
proportional to dt but not to y:

Constant source: dyldt = y + 5 starting from y = yo.
Notice y on both sides! My first guess y = et+' failed completely. Its derivative is et+'
again, which is not y + 5. The class suggested y = et 5t. But its derivative et + 5 is
still not y + 5. We tried other ways to produce 5 in dyldt. This idea is doomed to
failure. Finally we thought of y = Aet - 5. That has y' = Aet = y + 5 as required.
Important: A is not yo. Set t = 0 to find yo = A - 5. The source contributes 5et - 5:

+

The solution is (yo+ 5)e' - 5. That is the same as yOef+ 5(et- 1).
s = 5 multiplies the growth term ef - 1 that starts at zero. yoefgrows as before.
EXAMPLE 5 dyldt = - y + 5 has y = (yo- 5)e-'

+ 5. This is y0e-' + 5(1 - e-').

7

That final term from the soul-ce is still positive. The other term yoe-' decays to zero.
The limit as t + is y, = 5 . A negative c leads to a steady state y,.
Based on these examples with c = 1 and c = -- 1, we can find y for any c and s.

(7)

The source could be a deposit of s = $1000/year, after an initial investment of yo =
$8000. Or we can withdraw funds at s = - $200/year. The units are "dollars per year"
to match dyldt. The equation feeds in $1000 or removes $200 continuously-not all
at once.
Note again that y = e(c+s)t
is not a solution. Its derivative is (c + sly. The combination y = ect+ s is also not a solution (but closer). The analysis of y' = cy + s will be
our main achievement for dzrerential equations (in this section). The equation is not
restricted to finance-far from it-but that produces excellent examples.
I propose to find y in four ways. You may feel that one way is enough.? The first
way is the fastest-only three lines-but please give the others a chance. There is no
point in preparing for real problems if we don't solve them.
Solution by Method 1 (fast way) Substitute the combination y = Aec' + B. The solution has this form-exponential plus constant. From two facts we find A and B:

the equation y' = cy + s gives cAect= c(Aect+ B) + s
the initial value at t = 0 gives A + B = yo.

tMy class says one way is more than enough. They just want the answer. Sometimes I cave
in and write down the formula: y is y,ect plus s(e" - l)/c from the source term.

KEY FORMULA y =

With s = 0 this is the old solution yoect (no source). The example with c = 1 and
s = 5 produced ( y o + 5)ef - 5. Separating the source term gives yo& + 5(et - 1).
Solution by Method 2 (slow way) The input yo produces the output yo@. After t
years any deposit is multiplied by ea. That also applies to deposits made after the
account is opened. If the deposit enters at time 'IS the growing time is only t - T
Therefore the multiplying factor is only ec(t- This growth factor applies to the small

deposit (amount s d T ) made between time T and T + dT.
Now add up all outputs at time t. The output from yo is yoea. The small deposit
s dTnear time T grows to ec('-T)sdT. The total is an integral:

This principle of Duhamel would still apply when the source s varies with time.
Here s is constant, and the integral divides by c:

That agrees with the source term from Method 1, at the end of equation (8). There
we looked for "exponential plus constant," here we added up outputs.
Method 1 was easier. It succeeded because we knew the form A&'+ B-with
"undetermined coefficients." Method 2 is more complete. The form for y is part of
the output, not the input. The source s is a continuous supply of new deposits, all
growing separately. Section 6.5 starts from scratch, by directly integrating y' = cy + s.
Remark Method 2 is often described in terms of an integrating factor. First write
the equation as y' - cy = s. Then multiply by a magic factor that makes integration
possible:
( y r - cy)e-ct = se-c'
multiply by the factor e-"

integrate both sides
substitute 0 and t
isolate y to reach formula (8)

The integrating factor produced a perfect derivative in line 1. I prefer Duhamel's idea,
that all inputs yo and s grow the same way. Either method gives formula (8) for y.
THE MATHEMATICS OF FINANCE (AT A CONTINUOUS RATE)

The question from finance is this: What inputs give what outputs? The inputs can
come at the start by yo, or continuously by s. The output can be paid at the end or
continuously. There are six basic questions, two of which are already answered.
The future value is yoect from a deposit of yo. To produce y in the future, deposit
the present value ye-". Questions 3-6 involve the source term s. We fix the continuous

6 Exponentlab and Logarithms

rate at 5% per year (c = .05), and start the account from yo = 0. The answers come
fast from equation (8).
Question 3 With deposits of s = $1000/year, how large is y after 20 years?

One big deposit yields 20,000e z $54,000. The same 20,000 via s yields $34,400.
Notice a small by-product (for mathematicians). When the interest rate is c = 0,
our formula s(ec'- l)/c turns into 010. We are absolutely sure that depositing
$1000/year with no interest produces $20,000 after 20 years. But this is not obvious
from 010. By l'H6pital's rule we take c-derivatives in the fraction:
s(ec'- 1) = lim steC' =
lim st. This is (1000)(20)= 20,000.

Deposits of $582 over 20 years total $11,640. A single deposit of yo = 20,00O/e =

Questions 1and 2 had s = 0 (no source). Questions 3 and 4 had yo = 0 (no initial
deposit). Now we come to y = 0. In 5, everything is paid out by an annuity. In 6,
everything is paid up on a loan.
Question 5 What deposit yo provides $1000/year for 20 years? End with y = 0.

Substituting s = - 1000, c = .05, t = 20 gives yo x 12,640. If you win $20,000 in a
lottery, and it is paid over 20 years, the lottery only has to put in $12,640. Even less
if the interest rate is above 5%.
Question 6 What payments s will clear a loan of yo = $20,000 in 20 years?

Unfortunately, s exceeds $1000 per year. The bank gives up more than the $20,000
to buy your car (and pay tuition). It also gives up the interest on that money. You pay
that back too, but you don't have to stay even at every moment. Instead you repay
at a constant rate for 20 years. Your payments mostly cover interest at the start and
principal at the end. After t = 20 years you are even and your debt is y = 0.
This is like Question 5 (also y = O), but now we know yo and we want s:
y = yoec'+ - (ec' - 1)= 0 requires s = - cyoec'/(ec'- 1).
S

C

The loan is yo = $20,000, the rate is c = .05/year, the time is t = 20 years. Substituting
in the formula for s, your payments are $1582 per year.

After 20 years the continuous 582 has built up to 20,000 (including interest as in
Question 4). From that account we pay back the loan.

Fig. 6.10 Questions 3-4 deposit s. Questions 5-6 repay loan or annuity. Steady state -s/c.

TRANSIENTS VS. STEADY STATE
Suppose there is decay instead of growth. The constant c is negative and yoec" dies
out. That is the "transient" term, which disappears as t -+ co. What is left is the
"steady state." We denote that limit by y.
Without a source, y, is zero (total decay). When s is present, y, = - s/c:
6J The solution y = Yo + - e" - - approaches y,

=-

- when ec -*0.

At this steady state, the source s exactly balances the decay cy. In other words
cy + s = 0. From the left side of the differential equation, this means dy/dt = 0. There
is no change. That is why y, is steady.
Notice that y. depends on the source and on c-but not on yo.
EXAMPLE 6 Suppose Bermuda has a birth rate b = .02 and death rate d = .03. The
net decay rate is c = - .01. There is also immigration from outside, of s = 1200/year.
The initial population might be Yo = 5 thousand or Yo = 5 million, but that number
has no effect on yo. The steady state is independent of yo.
In this case y. = - s/c = 1200/.01 = 120,000. The population grows to 120,000 if
Yo is smaller. It decays to 120,000 if Yo is larger.
EXAMPLE 7 Newton's Law of Cooling:

dy/dt = c(y - y.).

(12)

This is back to physics. The temperature of a body is y. The temperature around it
is y.. Then y starts at Yo and approaches y,, following Newton's rule: The rate is
proportionalto y - y. The bigger the difference, the faster heat flows.
The equation has - cy. where before we had s. That fits with y. = - s/c. For the
solution, replace s by - cy. in formula (8). Or use this new method:

6 Exponentlab and bgariihms

Solution by Method 3 The new idea is to look at the dzrerence y - y, . Its derivative
is dy/dt, since y, is constant. But dy/dt is c(y - y,)- this is our equation. The difference starts from yo - y,, and grows or decays as a pure exponential:

d

Moving s/c to the right side recovers formula (8). There is a constant term and an
exponential term. In a differential equations course, those are the "particularsolution"

Logarithms

We have given first place to ex and a lower place to In x. In applications that is
absolutely correct. But logarithms have one important theoretical advantage (plus
many applications of their own). The advantage is that the derivative of In x is l/x,
whereas the derivative of ex is ex. We can't define ex as its own integral, without
circular reasoning. But we can and do define In x (the natural logarithm) as the
integral of the " - 1 power" which is llx:

Note the dummy variables, first x then u. Note also the live variables, first x then y.
Especially note the lower limit of integration, which is 1 and not 0. The logarithm is
the area measured from 1. Therefore In 1 = 0 at that starting point-as required.

253

6.4 Logarithms

Earlier chapters integrated all powers except this "-1 power." The logarithm is
that missing integral. The curve in Figure 6.11 has height y = 1/x-it is a hyperbola.
At x = 0 the height goes to infinity and the area becomes infinite: log 0 = - 00.
The minus sign is because the integral goes backward from 1 to 0. The integral
does not extend past zero to negative x. We are defining In x only for x > O.t

= In 2 = In 4.

With this new approach, In x has a direct definition. It is an integral (or an area).
Its two key properties must follow from this definition. That step is a beautiful
application of the theory behind integrals.
Property 1: In ab = In a + In b. The areas from 1 to a and from a to ab combine into
a single area (1 to ab in the middle figure):

The right side is In ab, from definition (1). The first term on the left is In a. The
problem is to show that the second integral (a to ab) is In b:
-

du = In b.

d x

(3)

We need u = 1 when x = a (the lower limit) and u = b when x = ab (the upper limit).
The choice u = x/a satisfies these requirements. Substituting x = au and dx = a du
yields dx/x = du/u. Equation (3) gives In b, and equation (2) is In a + In b = In ab.
Property2:

In b" = n In b. These are the left and right sides of
{b"1 dx

(?)

-Jdu.

(4)

This comes from the substitution x = u". The lower limit x = 1 corresponds to u = 1,
and x = b" corresponds to u = b. The differential dx is nu"-ldu. Dividing by x = u"
leaves dx/x = n du/u. Then equation (4) becomes In b" = n In b.

Everything comes logically from the definition as an area. Also definite integrals:

du. Solution: In e2 = 2. The area from 1 to e2 is 2.

Remark While working on the theory this is a chance to straighten out old debts.
The book has discussed and computed (and even differentiated) the functions ex and
bx and x", without defining them properly. When the exponent is an irrational number
like rt,
how do we multiply e by itself i times? One approach (not taken) is to come

closer and closer to it by rational exponents like 22/7. Another approach (taken now)
is to determine the number e' = 23.1 ...by its logarithm.t Start with e itself:

e is (by definition) the number whose logarithm is 1
e"is (by definition) the number whose logarithm is

7r.

When the area in Figure 6.12 reaches 1, the basepoint is e. When the area reaches

7E,

the basepoint is e'. We are constructing the inverse function (which is ex). But how
do we know that the area reaches 7t or 1000 or -1000 at exactly one point? (The
area is 1000 far out at e1000 . The area is -1000 very near zero at e-100ooo0.) To define

e we have to know that somewhere the area equals 1!
For a proof in two steps, go back to Figure 6.11c. The area from 1 to 2 is more
than 1 (because 1/x is more than - on that interval of length one). The combined area
from 1 to 4 is more than 1. We come to area = 1 before reaching 4. (Actually at

e = 2.718....) Since 1/x is positive, the area is increasing and never comes back to 1.
To double the area we have to square the distance. The logarithm creeps upwards:

In x -+ oo

but

Inx
x

(5)

--*0.

The logarithm grows slowly because ex grows so fast (and vice versa-they are
inverses). Remember that ex goes past every power x". Therefore In x is passed by

every root x'l". Problems 60 and 61 give two proofs that (In x)/xl"I approaches zero.
At x = 10 they are close (2.3 versus 3.2). But out
We might compare In x with x/.
at x = e'o the comparison is 10 against e5, and In x loses to x.

The calculator gives In 1.01 = .0099503. This is close to x = .01. Between 1 and 1 + x
the area under the graph of 1/x is nearly a rectangle. Its base is x and its height is 1.
So the curved area In (1 + x) is close to the rectangular area x. Figure 6.14 shows
how a small triangle is chopped off at the top.
The difference between .0099503 (actual) and .01 (linear approximation) is
-. 0000497. That is predicted almost exactly by the second derivative: ½ times (Ax)2
times (In x)" is (.01)2( - 1)= - .00005. This is the area of the small triangle!
In(1 + x) . rectangular area minus triangular area = x - Ix 2.
The remaining mistake of .0000003 is close to x3 (Problem 65).
May I switch to ex? Its slope starts at eo = 1, so its linear approximation is 1 + x.
Then In (ex) %In(1 + x) x x. Two wrongs do make a right: In (ex) = x exactly.
The calculator gives e0"1 as 1.0100502 (actual) instead of 1.01 (approximation). The
second-order correction is again a small triangle: ix 2 = .00005. The complete series

DERIVATIVES BASED ON LOGARITHMS
Logarithms turn up as antiderivatives very often. To build up a collection of integrals,
we now differentiate In u(x) by the chain rule.

The slope of In x was hard work in Section 6.2. With its new definition (the integral
of 1/x) the work is gone. By the Fundamental Theorem, the slope must be 1/x.
For In u(x) the derivative comes from the chain rule. The inside function is u, the
outside function is In. (Keep u > 0 to define In u.) The chain rule gives

Those are worth another look, especially the first. Any reasonable person would
expect the slope of In 3x to be 3/x. Not so. The 3 cancels, and In 3x has the same
slope as In x. (The real reason is that In 3x = In 3 + In x.) The antiderivative of 3/x is
not In 3x but 3 In x, which is In x 3.

6 Exponentials and Logarithms

Before moving to integrals, here is a new method for derivatives: logarithmic dzrerentiation or LD. It applies to products and powers. The product and power rules are
always available, but sometimes there is an easier way.
Main idea: The logarithm of a product p(x) is a sum of logarithms. Switching to
In p, the sum rule just adds up the derivatives. But there is a catch at the end, as you
see in the example.
EXAMPLE 4

2(x - 1)'

Now multiply by p(x):
The catch is that last step. Multiplying by p complicates the answer. This can't be
helped-logarithmic differentiation contains no magic. The derivative of p =fg is the
same as from the product rule: In p = l n f + In g gives

For p = xex sin x, with three factors, the sum has three terms:
In p = l n x + x + l n sin x and p l = p
L

We multiply p times pl/p (the derivative of In p). Do the same for powers:

INTEGRALS BASED ON LOGARITHMS

Now comes an important step. Many integrals produce logarithms. The foremost
example is llx, whose integral is In x. In a certain way that is the only example, but
its range is enormously extended by the chain rule. The derivative of In u(x) is uf/u,
so the integral goes from ul/u back to In u:
dx = ln u(x) or equivalently

= In

u.

Try to choose u(x) so that the integral contains duldx divided by u.
EXAMPLES

6.4 Logarithms

Final remark When u is negative, In u cannot be the integral of llu. The logarithm
is not defined when u < 0. But the integral can go forward by switching to - u:

jdu?

I-du/dx
dx= dx = In(- u).
-U

Thus In(- u) succeeds when In u fails.? The forbidden case is u = 0. The integrals In u
and In(- u), on the plus and minus sides of zero, can be combined as lnlul. Every
integral that gives a logarithm allows u < 0 by changing to the absolute value lul:

The areas are -1 and -In 3. The graphs of llx and l/(x - 5) are below the x axis.
We do not have logarithms of negative numbers, and we will not integrate l/(x - 5)
from 2 to 6. That crosses the forbidden point x = 5, with infinite area on both sides.
The ratio dulu leads to important integrals. When u = cos x or u = sin x, we are
integrating the tangent and cotangent. When there is a possibility that u < 0, write
the integral as In lul.

Now we report on the secant and cosecant. The integrals of llcos x and llsin x
also surrender to an attack by logarithms - based on a crazy trick:

(10)

Here u = sec x + tan x is in the denominator; duldx = sec x tan x sec2 x is above it.
The integral is In lul. Similarly (10) contains duldx over u = csc x - cot x.
In closing we integrate In x itself. The derivative of x In x is In x + 1. To remove
the extra 1, subtract x from the integral: ln x dx = x in x -x.
In contrast, the area under l/(ln x) has no elementary formula. Nevertheless it is
the key to the greatest approximation in mathematics-the prime number theorem.
The area J: dxlln x is approximately the number of primes between a and b. Near eloo0,
about 1/1000 of the integers are prime.

6.5 Separable Equations Including the Logistic Equation
This section begins with the integrals that solve two basic differential equations:
dy-- CY

and

dy

- cy + s.

We already know the solutions. What we don't know is how to discover those solutions, when a suggestion "try eC"' has not been made. Many important equations,
including these, separate into a y-integral and a t-integral. The answer comes directly
from the two separate integrations. When a differential equation is reduced that farto integrals that we know or can look up-it is solved.
One particular equation will be emphasized. The logistic equation describes the
speedup and slowdown of growth. Its solution is an S-curve, which starts slowly,
rises quickly, and levels off. (The 1990's are near the middle of the S, if the
prediction is correct for the world population.) S-curves are solutions to nonlinear
equations, and we will be solving our first nonlinear model. It is highly important
in biology and all life sciences.

6 Exponeniials and Logarithms

SEPARABLE EQUNIONS

The equations dyldt = cy and dyldt = cy + s (with constant source s) can be solved
by a direct method. The idea is to separate y from t:

9
= c dt
Y

dy - c dt.

and

Y + (sld

All y's are on the left side. All t's are on the right side (and c can be on either side).
This separation would not be possible for dyldt = y + t.
Equation (2) contains differentials. They suggest integrals. The t-integrals give ct
and the y-integrals give logarithms:
In y = ct

+ constant

and

(3)

In

The constant is determined by the initial condition. At t = 0 we require y = yo, and the
right constant will make that happen:
lny=ct+lnyo

and

+: +

(

(

In y + - = c t + l n y o + - .

Then the final step isolates y. The goal is a formula for y itself, not its logarithm, so
take the exponential of both sides (elnyis y):
y = yoeC'

and

y

= (yo

:)ec'.

It is wise to substitute y back into the differential equation, as a check.
This is our fourth method for y' = cy + s. Method 1 assumed from the start that
y = Aect B. Method 2 multiplied all inputs by their growth factors ec('- )' and added
up outputs. Method 3 solved for y - y,. Method 4 is separation of variables (and all
methods give the same answer). This separation method is so useful that we repeat
its main idea, and then explain it by using it.

+

To solve dyldt = u(y)v(t), separate dy/u(y)from v(t)dt and integrate both sides:

Then substitute the initial condition to determine C, and solve for y(t).
EXAMPLE I dyldt = y2 separates into dyly2 = dt. Integrate to reach - l/y = t + C.
Substitute t = 0 and y = yo to find C = - l/yo. Now solve for y:

This solution blows up (Figure 6.15a) when t reaches lly,. If the bank pays interest
on your deposit squared (y' = y2), you soon have all the money in the world.
EXAMPLE 2 dyldt = ty separates into dy/y = t dt. Then by integration in y = f t2 + C.
Substitute t = 0 and y = yo to find C = In yo. The exponential of *t2 + In yo gives
y = yoe'2'2. When the interest rate is c = t, the exponent is t2/2.
EXAMPLE 3 dyldt = y + t is not separable. Method 1 survives by assuming y =

EXAMPLE 4 Separate dyldt = nylt into dyly = n dtlt. By integration In y = n In t + C.
Substituting t = 0 produces In 0 and disaster. This equation cannot start from time
zero (it divides by t). However y can start from y, at t = 1, which gives C = In y, . The
solution is a power function y = y t ".
This was the first differential equation in the book (Section 2.2). The ratio of dyly
to dtlt is the "elasticity" in economics. These relative changes have units like
dollars/dollars-they are dimensionless, and y = tn has constant elasticity n.
On log-log paper the graph of In y = n In t + C is a straight line with slope n.

THE LOGISTIC EQUATION

The simplest model of population growth is dyldt = cy. The growth rate c is the birth
rate minus the death rate. If c is constant the growth goes on forever-beyond the
point where the model is reasonable. A population can't grow all the way to infinity!
Eventually there is competition for food and space, and y = ectmust slow down.
The true rate c depends on the population size y. It is a function c(y) not a constant.
The choice of the model is at least half the problem:
Problem in biology or ecology:
Problem in mathematics:

Discover c(y).

Solve dyldt = c(y)y.

Every model looks linear over a small range of y's-but not forever. When the rate
drops off, two models are of the greatest importance. The Michaelis-Menten equation
has c(y) = c/(y + K). The logistic equation has c(y) = c - by. It comes first.
The nonlinear effect is from "interaction." For two populations of size y and z, the
number of interactions is proportional to y times z. The Law of Mass Action produces
a quadratic term byz. It is the basic model for interactions and competition. Here we
have one population competing within itself, so z is the same as y. This competition
slows down the growth, because - by2 goes into the equation.
The basic model of growth versus competition is known as the logistic equation:
Normally b is very small compared to c. The growth begins as usual (close to ect).
The competition term by2 is much smaller than cy, until y itselfgets large. Then by2

6 Exponentlals and Logarithms

(with its minus sign) slows the growth down. The solution follows an S-curve that
we can compute exactly.
What are the numbers b and c for human population? Ecologists estimate the
natural growth rate as c = .029/year. That is not the actual rate, because of b. About
1930, the world population was 3 billion. The cy term predicts a yearly increase of
(.029)(3billion) = 87 million. The actual growth was more like dyldt = 60 millionlyear.
That difference of 27 millionlyear was by2:
) ~ to b = 3 10- 12/year.
27 millionlyear = b(3 b i l l i ~ n leads
Certainly b is a small number (three trillionths) but its effect is not small. It reduces
87 to 60. What is fascinating is to calculate the steady state, when the new term by2
equals the old term cy. When these terms cancel each other, dyldt = cy - by2 is zero.
The loss from competition balances the gain from new growth: cy = by2 and y = c/b.
The growth stops at this equilibrium point-the top of the S-curve:
c
Y,=T;=

.029
3 1012= 10 billion people.

According to Verhulst's logistic equation, the world population is converging to 10
billion. That is from the model. From present indications we are growing much faster.
We will very probably go beyond 10 billion. The United Nations report in Section 3.3
predicts 11 billion to 14 billion.
Notice a special point halfway to y, = clb. (In the model this point is at 5 billion.)
It is the inflection point where the S-curve begins to bend down. The second derivative
d2y/dt2is zero. The slope dyldt is a maximum. It is easier to find this point from the
differential equation (which gives dyldt) than from y. Take one more derivative:

y" = (cy - by2)' = cy' - 2byy' = (c - 2by)y'.

(8)
The factor c - 2by is zero at the inflection point y = c/2b, halfway up the S-curve.
THE S-CURVE

The logistic equation is solved by separating variables y and t:

J

)

dyldt = cy - by2 becomes dy/(cy - by2)= dt.
The first question is whether we recognize this y-integral. No. The second question
is whether it is listed in the cover of the book. No. The nearest is Idx/(a2 - x2),which
can be reached with considerable manipulation (Problem 21). The third question is
whether a general method is available. Yes. "Partial fractions" is perfectly suited to
l/(cy - by2), and Section 7.4 gives the following integral of equation (9):
Y
In-=ct+C
c - by

Yo
In-=C.
(10)
c - YO
That constant C makes the solution correct at t = 0. The logistic equation is integrated, but the solution can be improved. Take exponentials of both sides to remove
the logarithms:

andthen

--y - ect Yo
c-by
c-byo'
This contains the same growth factor ec' as in linear equations. But the logistic

263

6.5 Separable Equations Including the Logistic Equation

equation is not linear-it is not y that increases so fast. According to (ll), it is
y/(c - by) that grows to infinity. This happens when c - by approaches zero.
The growth stops at y = clb. That is the final population of the world (10 billion?).
We still need a formula for y. The perfect S-curve is the graph of y = 1/(1 + e-'). It
equals 1 when t = oo, it equals 4 when t = 0, it equals 0 when t = - co. It satisfies
y' = y - y2, with c = b = 1. The general formula cannot be so beautiful, because it
allows any c, b, and yo. To find the S-curve, multiply equation (11) by c - by and
solve for y:

When t approaches infinity, e-" approaches zero. The complicated part of the formula disappears. Then y approaches its steady state clb, the asymptote in Figure 6.16.
The S-shape comes from the inflection point halfway up.

EXAMPLE 1 (United States population) The table shows the actual population and
the model. Pearl and Reed used census figures for 1790, 1850, and 1910 to compute

depression. Probably more important is immigration."fn fact the Pearl-Reed steady
state c/b is below 200 million, which the US has already passed. Certainly their model
can be and has been improved. The 1990 census predicted a stop before 300 million.
For constant immigration s we could still solve y' = cy - by2 + s by partial fractionsbut in practice the computer has taken over. The table comes from Braun's book
DifSerentiaE Equations (Springer 1975).

?Immigration does not enter for the world population model (at least not yet).

6 Exponentials and Logarithms

Remark For good science the y2 term should be explained and justified. It gave a
nonlinear model that could be completely solved, but simplicity is not necessarily
truth. The basic justification is this: In a population of size y, the number of encounters
is proportional to y2. If those encounters are fights, the term is - by2. If those
encounters increase the population, as some like to think, the sign is changed. There
is a cooperation term + by2, and the population increases very fast.
EXAMPLE 5 y' = cy + by2: y goes to infinity in afinite time.
EXAMPLE 6 y'

= - dy

+ by2:

y dies to zero

if yo < dlb.

In Example 6 death wins. A small population dies out before the cooperation by2
can save it. A population below dlb is an endangered species.
The logistic equation can't predict oscillations-those go beyond dyldt =f(y).
The y line Here is a way to understand every nonlinear equation y' =f(y). Draw a
" y line." Add arrows to show the sign of f(y). When y' =f ( y ) is positive, y is increasing
(itfollows the arrow to the right). When f is negative, y goes to the left. When f is zero,
the equation is y' = 0 and y is stationary:

y'

= cy - by2 (this

y'

is f(y))

= - dy

+ by2 (this is f(y))

The arrows take you left or right, to the steady state or to infinity. Arrows go toward
stable steady states. The arrows go away, when the stationary point is unstable. The
y line shows which way y moves and where it stops.

Kinetics of a chemical reaction mA + nB -+ pC.

The reaction combines m molecules of A with n molecules of B to produce p
molecules of C. The numbers m, n, p are 1, 1,2 for hydrogen chloride: H, + C1, =
2 HCl. The Law of Mass Action says that the reaction rate is proportional to the
product of the concentrations [ A ] and [ B ] . Then [ A ] decays as [ C ] grows:
d[A]/dt=

r [ A ][ B ]

and

d [Clldt =

+ k [ A ][ B ] .

Chemistry measures r and k. Mathematics solves for [ A ] and [ C ] . Write y for the
concentration [ C ] , the number of molecules in a unit volume. Forming those y
molecules drops the concentration [ A ] from a, to a, - (m/p)y. Similarly [B] drops
from b, to b, - (n/p)y.The mass action law (15)contains y2:

This fits our nonlinear model (Problem 33-34). We now find this same mass action
in biology. You recognize it whenever there is a product of two concentrations.
THE MM EQUATION wdt=- cy/(y+ K)

Biochemical reactions are the keys to life. They take place continually in every living
organism. Their mathematical description is not easy! Engineering and physics go
far with linear models, while biology is quickly nonlinear. It is true that y' = cy is
extremely effective in first-order kinetics (Section 6.3), but nature builds in a nonlinear
regulator.
It is enzymes that speed up a reaction. Without them, your life would be in slow
motion. Blood would take years to clot. Steaks would take decades to digest. Calculus
would take centuries to learn. The whole system is awesomely beautiful-DNA tells
amino acids how to combine into useful proteins, and we get enzymes and elephants
and Isaac Newton.
Briefly, the enzyme enters the reaction and comes out again. It is the catalyst. Its
combination with the substrate is an unstable intermediate, which breaks up into a
new product and the enzyme (which is ready to start over).
Here are examples of catalysts, some good and some bad.
The platinum in a catalytic converter reacts with pollutants from the car engine.
(But platinum also reacts with lead-ten gallons of leaded gasoline and you
can forget the platinum.)
Spray propellants (CFC's) catalyze the change from ozone (03) into ordinary
oxygen (0J. This wipes out the ozone layer-our shield in the atmosphere.
Milk becomes yoghurt and grape juice becomes wine.
Blood clotting needs a whole cascade of enzymes, amplifying the reaction at
every step. In hemophilia-the "Czar's diseasew-the enzyme called Factor VIII
is missing. A small accident is disaster; the bleeding won't stop.
Adolph's Meat Tenderizer is a protein from papayas. It predigests the steak.
The same enzyme (chymopapain) is injected to soften herniated disks.
Yeast makes bread rise. Enzymes put the sour in sourdough.
Of course, it takes enzymes to make enzymes. The maternal egg contains the material
for a cell, and also half of the DNA. The fertilized egg contains the full instructions.
We now look at the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation, to describe these reactions.
It is based on the Law of Mass Action. An enzyme in concentration z converts a
substrate in concentration y by dyldt = - byz. The rate constant is 6, and you see
the product of "enzyme times substrate." A similar law governs the other reactions
(some go backwards). The equations are nonlinear, with no exact solution. It is
typical of applied mathematics (and nature) that a pattern can still be found.
What happens is that the enzyme concentration z(t) quickly drops to z, K/(y + K).
The Michaelis constant K depends on the rates (like 6) in the mass action laws.
Later the enzyme reappears (z, = 2,). But by then the first reaction is over. Its law
of mass action is effectively

with c =.bz,K. This is the Michaelis-Menten equation-basic to biochemistry.
The rate dyldt is all-important in biology. Look at the function cy/(y + K):
when y is large, dyldt x

-c

when y is small, dyldt x

- cylK.

6 Exponentials and Logarithms

The start and the finish operate at different rates, depending whether y dominates K
or K dominates y. The fastest rate is c.

We don't have a simple formula for y. We are lucky to get this close. A computer
can quickly graph y(t)-and we see the dynamics of enzymes.
Problems 27-32 follow up the Michaelis-Menten theory. In science, concentrations
and rate constants come with units. In mathematics, variables can be made dimensionless and constants become 1. We solve d v d T = Y/(Y + 1) and then $witch back
to y, t, c, K. This idea applies to other equations too.
Essential point: Most applications of calculus come through dzrerential equations.
That is the language of mathematics-with populations and chemicals and epidemics
obeying the same equation. Running parallel to dyldt = cy are the difference equations
that come next.

6.6 Powers lnstead of Exponentials
You may remember our first look at e. It is the special base for which ex has slope 1
at x = 0. That led to the great equation of exponential growth: The derivative of
ex equals ex. But our look at the actual number e = 2.71828 ... was very short.

6 Exponentlals and Logarithms

It appeared as the limit of (1 + lln)". This seems an unnatural way to write down
such an important number.
I want to show how (1 lln)" and (1 + xln)" arise naturally. They give discrete
growth infinite steps-with applications to compound interest. Loans and life insurance and money market funds use the discrete form of yf = cy + s. (We include extra
information about bank rates, hoping this may be useful some day.) The applications
in science and engineering are equally important. Scientific computing, like accounting, has diflerence equations in parallel with differential equations.

+

Knowing that this section will be full of formulas, I would like to jump ahead and
tell you the best one. It is an infinite series for ex. What makes the series beautiful is
that its derivative is itself:
Start with y = 1 + x. This has y = 1 and yt = 1 at x = 0. But y" is zero, not one.
Such a simple function doesn't stand a chance! No polynomial can be its own derivative, because the highest power xn drops down to nxn-l. The only way is to have no
highest power. We are forced to consider infinitely many terms-a power series-to
achieve "derivative equals function.''
To produce the derivative 1 + x, we need 1 x + ix2. Then i x 2 is the derivative
of Ax3, which is the derivative of &x4. The best way is to write the whole series at
once:

+

+ + i x 2 + 4x3 + &x4 + -.

Infinite series ex = 1 x

(1)

This must be the greatest power series ever discovered. Its derivative is itself:

The derivative of each term is the term before it. The integral of each term is the one
after it (so jexdx = ex + C). The approximation ex = 1 + x appears in the first two
terms. Other properties like (ex)(ex)= eZXare not so obvious. (Multiplying series is
hard but interesting.) It is not even clear why the sum is 2.718 ... when x = 1.
Somehow 1 + 1 + f + & + equals e. That is where (1 + lln)" will come in.
Notice that xn is divided by the product 1 2 3 * - . - n. This is "n factorial." Thus
x4 is divided by 1 2 3 4 = 4! = 24, and xS is divided by 5! = 120. The derivative of
x5/120 is x4/24, because 5 from the derivative cancels 5 from the factorial. In general
xn/n! has derivative xn- '/(n - l)! Surprisingly O! is 1.

-

Chapter 10 emphasizes that xn/n! becomes extremely small as n increases. The
infinite series adds up to a finite number-which is ex. We turn now to discrete
growth, which produces the same series in the limit.

213 Years After Loan, Uncle Sam is Dunned
San Antonio, May 26-More than 200 years ago, a wealthy Pennsylvania
merchant named Jacob DeHaven lent $450,000 to the Continental Congress to
rescue the troops at Valley Forge. That loan was apparently never repaid.
So Mr. DeHaven's descendants are taking the United States Government to
court to collect what they believe they are owed. The total: $141 billion if the
interest is compounded daily at 6 percent, the going rate at the time. If compounded yearly, the bill is only $98 billion.
The thousands of family members scattered around the country say they are
not being greedy. "It's not the money-it's the principle of the thing," said
Carolyn Cokerham, a DeHaven on her father's side who lives in San Antonio.

.

6.6 Powen Instead of Exponentlals

"You have to wonder whether there would even be a United States if this man
had not made the sacrifice that he did. He gave everything he had."
The descendants say that they are willing to be flexible about the amount of
settlement. But they also note that interest is accumulating at $190 a second.
"None of these people have any intention of bankrupting the Government,"
said Jo Beth Kloecker, a lawyer from Stafford, Texas. Fresh out of law school,
Ms. Kloecker accepted the case for less than the customary 30 percent
contingency.
It is unclear how many descendants there are. Ms. Kloecker estimates that
based on 10 generations with four children in each generation, there could be as
many as half a million.
The initial suit was dismissed on the ground that the statute of limitations is
six years for a suit against the Federal Government. The family's appeal asserts
that this violates Article 6 of the Constitution, which declares as valid all debts
owed by the Government before the Constitution was adopted.
Mr. DeHaven died penniless in 1812. He had no children.
C O M P O U N D INTEREST

The idea of compound interest can be applied right away. Suppose you invest $1000
at a rate of 100% (hard to do). If this is the annual rate, the interest after a year is
another $1000. You receive $2000 in all. But if the interest is compounded you receive
more:
after six months: Interest of $500 is reinvested to give $1500
end of year: New interest of $750 (50% of 1500) gives $2250 total.
The bank multiplied twice by 1.5 (1000 to 1500 to 2250). Compounding quarterly
multiplies four times by 1.25 (1 for principal, .25 for interest):
after one quarter the total is 1000 + (.25)(1000) = 1250
after two quarters the total is 1250 + (.25)(1250)= 1562.50
after nine months the total is 1562.50 + (.25)(1562.50)= 1953.12
after a full year the total is 1953.12 + (.25)(@53.12) = 2441.41
Each step multiplies by 1 + (l/n), to add one nth of a year's interest-still
quarterly conversion: (1 + 1/4)4x low

at 100%:

= 2441.41

monthly conversion: (1 + 1/12)" x 1 Q h= 2613.04
daily conversion: (1 + 1/365)36% 1000 = 2714.57.
Many banks use 360 days in a year, although computers have made that obsolete.
Very few banks use minutes (525,600 per year). Nobody compounds every second
(n = 31,536,000). But some banks offer continuous compounding. This is the limiting
case (n -+ GO) that produces e:
x 1000 approaches e x 1000 = 2718.28.

As l/n gets smaller, this approximation gets better. The limit is 1. Conclusion:

the same number (which is e).

2. Slow method for (1

This is a brutal use of the binomial theorem. It involves nothing smart like logarithms,
but the result is a fantastic new formula for e.
Practice for n = 3:
Binomial theorem for any positive integer n:

Each term in equation (4) approaches a limit as n + a.Typical terms are

Next comes 111 2 3 4. The sum of all those limits in (4) is our new formula for e:

In summation notation this is Z,"=, l/k! = e. The factorials give fast convergence:
Those nine terms give an accuracy that was not reached by n = 365 compoundings.
A limit is still involved (to add up the whole series). You never see e without a limit!
It can be defined by derivatives or integrals or powers (1 + l/n)" or by an infinite
series. Something goes to zero or infinity, and care is required.
All terms in equation (4) are below (or equal to) the corresponding terms in (5).
The power (1 + l/n)" approaches efrom below. There is a steady increase with n. Faster
compounding yields more interest. Continuous compounding at 100% yields e, as
each term in (4) moves up to its limit in (5).

Remark Change (1 + lln)" to (1 + xln)". Now the binomial theorem produces ex:

Please recognize ex on the right side! It is the infinite power series in equation (1).
The next term is x3/6 (x can be positive or negative). This is a final formula for ex:

The logarithm of that power is n In(1 + x/n) x n(x/n) = x. The power approaches ex.
To summarize: The quick method proves (1 + lln)" + e by logarithms. The slow
method (multiplying out every term) led to the infinite series. Together they show the
agreement of all our definitions of e.

DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS VS. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

We have the chance to see an important part of applied mathematics. This is not a
course on differential equations, and it cannot become a course on difference equations. But it is a course with a purpose-we aim to use what we know. Our main
application of e was to solve y' = cy and y' = cy + s. Now we solve the corresponding
difference equations.
Above all, the goal is to see the connections. The purpose of mathematics is to
understand and explain patterns. The path from "discrete to continuous" is beautifully
illustrated by these equations. Not every class will pursue them to the end, but I
cannot fail to show the pattern in a difference equation:
Each step multiplies by the same number a. The starting value yo is followed by ay,,
a2yo,and a3y0. The solution at discrete times t = 0, 1,2, ... is y(t) = atyo.
This formula atyo replaces the continuous solution ectyoof the differential equation.
decaying

Fig. 6.17 Growth for la1 > 1, decay for la1 < 1. Growth factor a compares to ec.

A source or sink (birth or death, deposit or withdrawal) is like y' = cy + s:
y(t + 1)= ay(t) + s.
Each step multiplies by a and adds s. The first outputs are
We saw this pattern for differential equations-every input s becomes a new starting
point. It is multiplied by powers of a. Since s enters later than yo, the powers stop at
t - 1. Algebra turns the sum into a clean formula by adding the geometric series:
y(t)= atyo+ s[at-' +at-'

+

+

+ a + 1]= atyo s(at- l)/(a- 1).

EXAMPLE 1 Interest at 8% from annual IRA deposits of s = $2000 (here yo = 0).

The first deposit is at year t = 1. In a year it is multiplied by a = 1.08, because 8% is
added. At the same time a new s = 2000 goes in. At t = 3 the first deposit has been
multiplied by (1.08)2,the second by 1.08, and there is another s = 2000. After year t,
y(t) = 2000(1.08' - 1)/(1.08 - 1).

With t = 1 this is 2000. With t = 2 it is 2000 (1.08 1)-two

deposits. Notice how

EXAMPLE 2 Approach to steady state when la1 < 1. Compare with c < 0.

With a > 1, everything has been increasing. That corresponds to c > 0 in the
differential equation (which is growth). But things die, and money is spent, so a can
be smaller than one. In that case atyo approaches zero-the starting balance disappears. What happens if there is also a source? Every year half of the balance y(t) is

6 Exponentials and Logartthms

spent and a new $2000 is deposited. Now a = +:
y(t + 1) = $y(t) + 2000 yields y(t) = (f)ty, + 2000[((+)' - I)/(+- I)].

EXAMPLE 3 Demand equals supply when the price is right.

Difference equations are basic to economics. Decisions are made every year (by a
farmer) or every day (by a bank) or every minute (by the stock market). There are
three assumptions:

1. Supply next time depends on price this time: S(t + 1) = cP(t).
2. Demand next time depends on price next time: D(t 1) = - dP(t + 1) + b.
3. Demand next time equals supply next time: D(t + 1) = S(t + 1).

+

Comment on 3: the price sets itself to make demand = supply. The demand slope - d
is negative. The supply slope c is positive. Those lines intersect at the competitive
price, where supply equals demand. To find the difference equation, substitute 1 and
2 into 3:
Difference equation: - dP(t 1) b = cP(t)

+ +

Steady state price:

- dP,

+ b = cP,.

Thus P,

= b/(c

+ d).

If the price starts above P,, the difference equation brings it down. If below, the
price goes up. When the price is P,, it stays there. This is not news-economic
theory depends on approach to a steady state. But convergence only occurs if c < d.
If supply is less sensitive than demand, the economy is stable.
Blow-up example: c = 2, b = d = 1. The difference equation is - P(t 1) + 1 = 2P(t).
From P(0) = 1 the price oscillates as it grows: P = - 1, 3, - 5, 11, ... .
Stable example: c = 112, b = d = 1. The price moves from P(0) = 1 to P(m) = 213:

+

- P(t

+ 1) + 1 = -21 P(t) yields

Increasing d gives greater stability. That is the effect of price supports. For d = 0
(fixed demand regardless of price) the economy is out of control.
THE MATHEMATICS OF FINANCE

It would be a pleasure to make this supply-demand model more realistic-with
curves, not straight lines. Stability depends on the slope-calculus enters. But we
also have to be realistic about class time. I believe the most practical application is
to solve the fundamentalproblems offinance. Section 6.3 answered six questions about
continuous interest. We now answer the same six questions when the annual rate is
x = .05 = 5% and interest is compounded n times a year.

6.6 Powers Instead of Exponentials

First we compute eflective rates, higher than .05 because of compounding:

T:.

(

compounded quarterly 1 + - = 1.0509 [effective rate .0509 = 5.09%]
compounded continuously

eno5= 1.O513 [effective rate 5.13%]

Now come the six questions. Next to the new answer (discrete) we write the old
answer (continuous). One is algebra, the other is calculus. The time period is 20 years,
so simple interest on yo would produce (.05)(20)(yo).That equals yo -money doubles
in 20 years at 5% simple interest.
Questions 1and 2 ask for the future value y and present value yo with compound
interest n times a year:
1. y growing from yo:
2. deposit yo to reach y:

y = (1
yo = (1

+

yonyo

+ :F20ny

y = e(~OS,(20)yo

yo = e-(-05)(20)y

Each step multiplies by a = (1 + .05/n). There are 20n steps in 20 years. Time goes
backward in Question 2. We divide by the growth factor instead of multiplying. The
future value is greater than the present value (unless the interest rate is negative!). As
n + GO the discrete y on the left approaches the continuous y on the right.
Questions 3 and 4 connect y to s (with yo = 0 at the start). As soon as each s is
deposited, it starts growing. Then y = s + as + a2s + --.
y = s [e(.05)(20)
- I]
(1 + .05/n)20n- I]
3. y growing from deposits s:
y = s[
.05/n
.05
4. deposits s to reach y:
Questions 5 and 6 connect yo to s. This time y is zero-there is nothing left at the
end. Everything is paid. The deposit yo is just enough to allow payments of s. This
is an annuity, where the bank earns interest on your yo while it pays you s (n times
a year for 20 years). So your deposit in Question 5 is less than 20ns.
Question 6 is the opposite-a loan. At the start you borrow yo (instead of giving
the bank yo). You can earn interest on it as you pay it back. Therefore your payments
have to total more than yo. This is the calculation for car loans and mortgages.
5. Annuity: Deposit yo to receive 20n payments of s:

6. Loan:. Repay yo with 20n payments of s:

Questions 2 , 4 , 6 are the inverses of 1,3,5. Notice the pattern: There are three numbers y, yo, and s. One of them-is zero each time. If all three are present, go back to
equation (9).
The algebra for these lines is in the exercises. I t is not calculus because At is not dt.
All factors in brackets [
1 are listed in tables, and the banks keep copies. It might

6 Exponenlials and Logartthms

also be helpful to know their symbols. If a bank has interest rate i per period over
N periods, then in our notation a = 1 + i = 1 + .05/n and t = N = 20n:
future value of yo = $1 (line 1):y(N) = (1 + i)N
present value of y = $1 (line 2): yo = (1 + i)-N
future value of s = $1 (line 3): y(N) = s~~= [(I
present value of s = $1 (line 5): yo = a~~= [ l -

+ i)N- l]/i
(1 + i)-']/i

To tell the truth, I never knew the last two formulas until writing this book. The
mortgage on my home has N = (12)(25) monthly payments with interest rate i =
.07/12. In 1972 the present value was $42,000 = amount borrowed. I am now going
to see if the bank is honest.?
Remark In many loans, the bank computes interest on the amount paid back
instead of the amount received. This is called discounting. A loan of $1000 at 5%
for one year costs $50 interest. Normally you receive $1000 and pay back $1050.
With discounting you receive $950 (called the proceeds) and you pay back $1000.
The true interest rate is higher than 5%-because the $50 interest is paid on the
smaller amount $950. In this case the "discount rate" is 501950 = 5.26%.
SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING: DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS BY DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS

In biology and business, most events are discrete. In engineering and physics, time
and space are continuous. Maybe at some quantum level it's all the same, but the
equations of physics (starting with Newton's law F = ma) are differential equations.
The great contribution of calculus is to model the rates of change we see in nature.
But to solve that model with a computer, it needs to be made digital and discrete.
These paragraphs work with dyldt = cy. It is the test equation that all analysts use,
as soon as a new computing method is proposed. Its solution is y = ect,starting from
yo = 1. Here we test Euler's method (nearly ancient, and not well thought of). He
replaced dyldt by AylAt:

The left side is dyldt, in the limit At + 0. We stop earlier, when At > 0.
The problem is to solve (13). Multiplying by At, the equation is
y(t + At) = (1 + cAt)y(t)

(with y(0) = 1).

Each step multiplies by a = 1 + cAt, so n steps multiply by an:
y = an= (1 + cAt)" at time nAt.

(14)
This is growth or decay, depending on a. The correct ectis growth or decay, depending
on c. The question is whether an and eczstay close. Can one of them grow while the
other decays? We expect the difference equation to copy y' = cy, but we might be
wrong.
A good example is y' = - y. Then c = - 1 and y = e-'-the true solution decays.

?It's not. s is too big. I knew it.

The calculator gives the following answers an for n = 2, 10,20:

The big step At = 3 shows total instability (top row). The numbers blow up when
they should decay. The row with At = 1 is equally useless (all zeros). In practice the
magnitude of cAt must come down to .10 or .05. For accurate calculations it would
have to be even smaller, unless we change to a better difference equation. That is the
right thing to do.
Notice the two reasonable numbers. They are .35 and .36, approaching e- = .37.
They come from n = 10 (with At = 1/10) and n = 20 (with At = 1/20). Those have the
same clock time nAt = 1:

'

The main diagonal of the table is executing (1 + xln)" -,e" in the case x = - 1.
Final question: How quickly are .35 and .36 converging to e-' = .37? With At = .10
the error is .02. With At = .05 the error is .01. Cutting the time step in half cuts the
error in half. We are not keeping enough digits to be sure, but the error seems close
to *At. To test that, apply the "quick method" and estimate an= (1 - Atr from its
logarithm:
ln(1- Atr = n ln(1- At) z n[- At - + ( ~ t ) =
~ ]- 1 - f At.
The clock time is nAt = 1. Now take exponentials of the far left and right:

'

'.

The differencebetween an and e- is the last term *Ate- Everything comes down
to one question: Is that error the same as *At? The answer is yes, because e-'12 is
115. If we keep only one digit, the prediction is perfect!
That took an hour to work out, and I hope it takes longer than At to read. I wanted
you to see in use the properties of In x and e". The exact property In an= n In a came
first. In the middle of (15) was the key approximation ln(1 + x) z x - f x2, with x =
- At. That x2 term uses the second derivative (Section 6.4). At the very end came
e"xl+x.
A linear approximation shows convergence: (1 x/n)" -,ex. A quadratic shows the
error: proportional to At = l/n. It is like using rectangles for areas, with error proportional to Ax. This minimal accuracy was enough to define the integral, and here it is
enough to define e. It is completely unacceptable for scientific computing.
The trapezoidal rule, for integrals or for y' = cy, has errors of order (Ax)2and (At)2.
All good software goes further than that. Euler's first-order method could not predict
the weather before it happens.

This section combines ex with e - x. Up to now those functions have gone separate

earned names of their own (cosh x and sinh x):

The first name rhymes with "gosh". The second is usually pronounced "cinch".
The graphs in Figure 6.18 show that cosh x > sinh x. For large x both hyperbolic
functions come extremely close to ½ex. When x is large and negative, it is e- x that
dominates. Cosh x still goes up to + 00 while sinh x goes down to - co (because
sinh x has a minus sign in front of e-x).

The following facts come directly from ((ex + e - x) and ½(ex - e-X):
cosh(- x) = cosh x and cosh 0 = 1 (cosh is even like the cosine)
sinh(- x) = - sinh x and sinh 0 = 0

(sinh is odd like the sine)

Exponentials and Logarithms

The graph of cosh x corresponds to a hanging cable (hanging under its weight).
Turned upside down, it has the shape of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. That must
be the largest upside-down cosh function ever built. A cable is easier to construct
than an arch, because gravity does the work. With the right axes in Problem 55, the
height of the cable is a stretched-out cosh function called a catenary:
y = a cosh (x/a)

(cable tension/cable density = a).

Busch Stadium in St. Louis has 96 catenary curves, to match the Arch.
The properties of the hyperbolic functions come directly from the definitions. There
are too many properties to memorize-and no reason to do it! One rule is the most
important. Every fact about sines and cosines is reflected in a correspondingfact about
sinh x and cosh x. Often the only difference is a minus sign. Here are four properties:
1. (cosh x)2 - (sinh x)2 = 1

The unit circle cos 2 t + sin 2 t = 1 and the unit hyperbola cosh 2 t - sinh 2 t = 1.

Property 1 is the connection to hyperbolas. It is responsible for the "h" in cosh and
sinh. Remember that (cos x)2 + (sin x)2 = 1 puts the point (cos x, sin x) onto a unit
circle. As x varies, the point goes around the circle. The ordinary sine and cosine are
"circular functions." Now look at (cosh x, sinh x). Property 1 is (cosh x) 2 - (sinh x) 2 =
1, so this point travels on the unit hyperbola in Figure 6.20.

I think "tanh" is pronounceable, and "sech" is easy. The others are harder. Their

INVERSE HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS

You remember the angles sin-'x and tan-'x and sec-'x. In Section 4.4 we
differentiated those inverse functions by the chain rule. The main application was to
integrals. If we happen to meet jdx/(l+ x2), it is tan-'x + C. The situation for
sinh- 'x and tanh- 'x and sech- 'x is the same except for sign changes - which are
expected for hyperbolic functions. We write down the three new derivatives:
y = sinh-'x (meaning x = sinh y) has

y = tanh-'x (meaning x = tanh y) has

y = sech - x (meaning x = sech y) has

X J i 7

Problems 44-46 compute dyldx from l/(dx/dy). The alternative is to use logarithms.
Since In x is the inverse of ex, we can express sinh-'x and tanh-'x and sech-'x as
logarithms. Here is y = tanh- 'x:

The last step is an ordinary derivative of 4 ln(1 + x) - ln(1 - x). Nothing is new
except the answer. But where did the logarithms come from? In the middle of the
following identity, multiply above and below by cosh y:
1 + x - 1 + tanh y - cosh y + sinh y - -eY
-- - e2y.
1 - x 1- tanh y cosh y - sinh y e-y

Then 2y is the logarithm of the left side. This is the first equation in (4), and it is the
third formula in the following list:

Remark 1 Those are listed onlyfor reference. If possible do not memorize them. The
derivatives in equations (I), (2), (3) offer a choice of antiderivatives - either inverse
functions or logarithms (most tables prefer logarithms). The inside cover of the book
has

1%

fln[E]

(in place of tanh- 'x

+ C).

Remark 2 Logarithms were not seen for sin- 'x and tan- 'x and sec - 'x. You might

6 Exponentials and Logarithms

wonder why. How does it happen that tanh-'x is expressed by logarithms, when the
parallel formula for tan-lx was missing? Answer: There must be a parallel formula.
To display it I have to reveal a secret that has been hidden throughout this section.
The secret is one of the great equations of mathematics. What formulas for cos x
and sin x correspond to &ex + e-x) and &ex- e-x)? With so many analogies
(circular vs. hyperbolic) you would expect to find something. The formulas do exist,
but they involve imaginary numbers. Fortunately they are very simple and there is
no reason to withhold the truth any longer:
1
cosx=-(eix+eix)
2

and

1 .
sin~=-(e'~--e-'~).
2i

(5)

It is the imaginary exponents that kept those identities hidden. Multiplying sin x by
i and adding to cos x gives Euler's unbelievably beautiful equation
cos x + i sin x = eiX.

(6)

That is parallel to the non-beautiful hyperbolic equation cosh x + sinh x = ex.
I have to say that (6) is infinitely more important than anything hyperbolic will
ever be. The sine and cosine are far more useful than the sinh and cosh. So we end
our record of the main properties, with exercises to bring out their applications.

Techniques of Integration

Chapter 5 introduced the integral as a limit of sums. The calculation of areas was
started-by hand or computer. Chapter 6 opened a different door. Its new functions
ex and In x led to differential equations. You might say that all along we have been
solving the special differential equation dfldx = v(x). The solution is f = 1v(x)dx. But
the step to dyldx = cy was a breakthrough.
The truth is that we are able to do remarkable things. Mathematics has a language,
and you are learning to speak it. A short time ago the symbols dyldx and J'v(x)dx
were a mystery. (My own class was not too sure about v(x) itself-the symbol for a
function.) It is easy to forget how far we have come, in looking ahead to what is next.
I do want to look ahead. For integrals there are two steps to take-more functions
and more applications. By using mathematics we make it live. The applications are
most complete when we know the integral. This short chapter will widen (very much)
the range of functions we can integrate. A computer with symbolic algebra widens it
more.
Up to now, integration depended on recognizing derivatives. If v(x) = sec2x then
f(x) = tan x. To integrate tan x we use a substitution:,

I!&dx.=-1"-

- - In u =

- In cos x.

U

What we need now ,are techniques for other integrals, to change them around until
dx, which are not
we can attack them. Two examples are j x cos x dx and 5 ,/immediately recognizable. With integration by parts, and a new substitution, they
become simple.
Those examples indicate where this chapter starts and stops. With reasonable effort
(and the help of tables, which is fair) you can integrate important functions. With
intense effort you could integrate even more functions. In older books that extra
exertion was made-it tended to dominate the course. They had integrals like
J(x + l)dx/,-/,
which we could work on if we had to. Our time is too
valuablefor that! Like long division, the ideas are for us and their intricate elaboration
is for the computer.
Integration by parts comes first. Then we do new substitutions. Partial fractions
is a useful idea (already applied to the logistic equation y' = cy - by2). In the last
section x goes to infinity or y(x) goes to infinity-but the area stays finite. These
improper integrals are quite common. Chapter 8 brings the applications.

283

Integration by Parts

7.1

7.1 Integration by Parts
There are two major ways to manipulate integrals (with the hope of making them
easier). Substitutions are based on the chain rule, and more are ahead. Here we
present the other method, based on the product rule. The reverse of the product rule,
to find integrals not derivatives, is integration by parts.
We have mentioned Jcos2x dx and JInx dx. Now is the right time to compute
them (plus more examples). You will see how J Inx dx is exchanged for J1 dx-a
definite improvement. Also Jxex dx is exchanged for Jex dx. The difference between
the harder integral and the easier integral is a known term-that is the point.
One note before starting: Integration by parts is not just a trick with no meaning.
On the contrary, it expresses basic physical laws of equilibrium and force balance.
It is a foundation for the theory of differential equations (and even delta functions).
The final paragraphs, which are completely optional, illustrate those points too.
We begin with the product rule for the derivative of u(x) times v(x):
u(x)

dv

dx

du
d
+ v(x)d - d (u(x)v(x)).

(1)

dx dx

Integrate both sides. On the right, integration brings back u(x)v(x). On the left are
two integrals, and one of them moves to the other side (with a minus sign):

dx = u(x)v(x) - v(x)

u(x)

(2)

dx.

That is the key to this section-not too impressive at first, but very powerful. It is
integration by parts (u and v are the parts). In practice we write it without x's:
7A

The integration by parts formula is j u dv = uv - Jv du.

(3)

The problem of integrating u dv/dx is changed into the problem of integrating
v du/dx. There is a minus sign to remember, and there is the "integrated term" u(x)v(x).
In the definite integral, that product u(x)v(x) is evaluated at the endpoints a and b:

Lb

dv

u

du

u(b)v(b) - u(a)v(a) -

dx

v dx.

a dx
dx
The key is in choosing u and v. The goal of that choice is to make
j u dv. This is best seen by examples.
EXAMPLE 1

(4)

5 v du easier than

For f Inx dx choose u = Inx and dv = dx (so v= x):
In xdx

=

uv -

v du = x ln x -

x

dx.

I used the basic formula (3). Instead of working with Inx (searching for an antiderivative), we now work with the right hand side. There x times l/x is 1. The integral of
1 is x. Including the minus sign and the integrated term uv = x Inx and the constant
C, the answer is
J Inx dx = x Inx - x + C.
(5)
For safety, take the derivative. The product rule gives Inx + x(1/x) - 1, which is Inx.
The area under y = Inx from 2 to 3 is 3 In3 - 3 - 2 In 2 + 2.

7 Techniques of Integration

To repeat: We exchanged the integral of In x for the integral of 1.

5

EXAMPLE 2 For x cos x dx choose u = x and dv = cos x dx (so v(x) = sin x):

Again the right side has a simple integral, which completes the solution:
J'xcos x d x = x sin x + c o s x + C.

(7)

Note The new integral is not always simpler. We could have chosen u = cos x and
dv = x dx. Then v = fx2. Integration using those parts give the true but useless result

The last integral is harder instead of easier (x2 is worse than x). In the forward
direction this is no help. But in the opposite direction it simplifies Sf x2 sin x dx. The
idea in choosing u and v is this: Try to give u a nice derivative and du a nice integral.
EXAMPLE 3 For J (cos x ) dx
~ choose u = cos x and dv = cos x dx (so v = sin x):

The last integral on the right joins its twin on the left, and J' 1 dx = x:

+ x.

Dividing by 2 gives the answer, which is definitely not gcos x ) ~Add

{(cos x)' dx = f (cos x sin x + x) + C.

(8)

Question Integrate (cos x)' from 0 to 2n. Why should the area be n?
Answer The definite integral is gcos x sin x + x)]:". This does give n. That area can
~ (sin x ) =~ 1. The area under
also be found by common sense, starting from (cos x ) +
1 is 2n. The areas under (cos x ) and
~ (sin x ) are

The last integral has w = 1 + x2 below and almost has dw = 2x dx above:

Substituting back into (9) gives J tan- 'x dx as x tan- 'x - f ln(1 + x2).All the familiar
inverse functions can be integrated by parts (take v = x, and add " + C" at the end).
Our final example shows how two integrations by parts may be needed, when the
first one only simplifies the problem half way.

ex, but it still needs work:

f xexdx = uv - fv

(11)
du = xex - exdx (now u = x).
Finally ex is alone. After two integrations by parts, we reach I exdx. In equation (11),
the integralof xex is xex - ex. Substituting back into (10),
(12)
f x 2exdx = x 2ex - 2[xex - ex] + C.

Fig. 7.1 The geometry of integration by parts. Delta function (area 1) multiplies v(x) at x = 0.

In the movie Stand and Deliver, the Los Angeles teacher Jaime Escalante computed

J x 2sin x dx with two integrations by parts. His success was through exercises-plus

insight in choosing u and v. (Notice the difference from f x sin x 2 dx. That falls the
other way-to a substitution.) The class did extremely well on the Advanced Placement Exam. If you saw the movie, you remember that the examiner didn't believe
it was possible. I spoke to him long after, and he confirms that practice was the key.
THE DELTA FUNCTION
From the most familiar functions we move to the least familiar. The delta function is

the derivative of a step function. The step function U(x) jumps from 0 to 1 at x = 0.
We write 6(x) = dU/dx, recognizing as we do it that there is no genuine derivative at
the jump. The delta function is the limit of higher and higher spikes-from the
"burst of speed" in Section 1.2. They approach an infinite spike concentrated at a
single point (where U jumps). This "non-function" may be unconventional--it is
certainly optional-but it is important enough to come back to.
The slope dU/dx is zero except at x = 0, where the step function jumps. Thus
6(x) = 0 except at that one point, where the delta function has a "spike." We cannot
give a value for 6 at x = 0, but we know its integralacross the jump. On every interval
from - A to A, the integral of dU/dx brings back U:
-A

6(x) dx= -

d= U(x)] A = 1.
dx

(13)

"The area under the infinitely tall and infinitely thin spike 6(x) equals 1."
So far so good. The integral of 6(x) is U(x). We now integrate by parts for a crucial
purpose-tofindthe area under v(x)6(x). This is an ordinary function times the delta
function. In some sense v(x) times 6(x) equals v(O) times 6(x)-because away from
x = 0 the product is always zero. Thus ex6(x) equals 6(x), and sin x 6(x) = 0.

286

7 Techniques of Integration
The area under v(x)6(x) is v(0)-which integration by parts will prove:
7B

The integral of v(x) times 6(x) is fA_ v(x)6(x)dx = v(0).

The area is v(0) because the spike is multiplied by v(O)-the value of the smooth
function v(x) at the spike. But multiplying infinity is dangerous, to say the least. (Two
times infinity is infinity). We cannot deal directly with the delta function. It is only
known by its integrals!As long as the applications produce integrals (as they do), we
can avoid the fact that 6 is not a true function.
The integral of v(x)6(x)= v(x)dU/dx is computed "by parts:"

v(x)6(x) dx

v(x)U(x)] A -

dx = v(A) - (v(A) - v(O))= v(O).

When v(x) = 1, this answer matches f 6dx = 1. We give three examples:
S2 cos x 6(x) dx = 1

f6 5 (U(x) + 6(x))dx = 7

1_1 (6(x))2dx = c00.

A nightmare question occurs to me. What is the derivative of the deltafunction?

INTEGRATION BY PARTS IN ENGINEERING
Physics and engineering and economics frequently involve products. Work is force
times distance. Power is voltage times current. Income is price times quantity. When
there are several forces or currents or sales, we add the products. When there are
infinitely many, we integrate (probably by parts).
I start with differential equations for the displacement u at point x in a bar:
dv

dx

S= f(x) with v(x) = k

du

dx

(16)

This describes a hanging bar pulled down by a forcef(x). Each point x moves through
a distance u(x). The top of the bar is fixed, so u(0)= 0. The stretching in the bar is
du/dx. The internal force created by stretching is v = k du/dx. (This is Hooke's law.)
Equation (16) is a balance offorces on the small piece of the bar in Figure 7.2.

Fig. 7.2

7.1 Integration by Paits

EXAMPLE 6 Supposef(x) = F, a constant force per unit length. We can solve (16):
V(X) =

- Fx + C

and

ku(x) = - f FX'

+ C x + D.

(17)

The constants C and D are settled at the endpoints (as usual for integrals). At x = 0
we are given u = O so D = O . At x = 1 we are given v = W so C = W + F. Then v(x)
and u(x)give force and displacement in the bar.
To see integration by parts, multiply - dvldx =f(x) by u(x)and integrate:

]

u(x) dx = - u(x)v(x)]i+

The left side is force times displacement, or external work. The last term is internal
force times stretching-or internal work. The integrated term has u(0) = 0-the fixed
support does no work. It also has -u(l)W, the work by the hanging weight. The
balance of forces has been replaced by a balance of work.
This is a touch of engineering mathematics, and here is the main point. Integration
by parts makes physical sense! When - dvldx =f is multiplied by other functionscalled test functions or virtual displacements-then equation (18) becomes the
principle of virtual work. It is absolutely basic to mechanics.

7.2 Trigonometric Integrals
The next section will put old integrals into new forms. For example x2 ,/-'
dx
will become jsin20 cos20 dB. That looks simpler because the square root is gone. But
still sin20 cos28 has to be integrated. This brief section integrates any product of shes
and cosines and secants and tangents.
There are two methods to choose from. One uses integration by parts, the other
is based on trigonometric identities. Both methods try to make the integral easy (but
that may take time). We follow convention by changing the letter 8 back to x.

7.2 Trigonometric Integrals

Notice that sin4x cos x dx is easy to integrate. It is u4du. This is the goal in
Example l-to separate out cos x dx. It becomes du, and sin x is u.
EXAMPLE I

j sin2xcos3x dx (the exponent 3 is odd)

Solution Keep cos x dx as du. Convert the other cos2x to 1 - sin2x:

EXAMPLE 2

5 sin5x dx

(the exponent 5 is odd)

Solution Keep sin x dx and convert everything else to cosines. The conversion is

dx is du. We have !(- 1 + 2u2 - u4)du.

5 sinmxcosnx dx, when m or n is odd

If n is odd, separate out a single cos x dx. That leaves an even number of cosines.
Convert them to sines. Then cos x dx is du and the sines are u's.
If m is odd, separate out a single sin x dx as du. Convert the rest to cosines.
If m and n are both odd, use either method.
If m and n are both even, a new method is needed. Here are two examples.
EXAMPLE 3

5 cos2x dx

(m = 0,n = 2, both even)

There are two good ways to integrate cos2x, but substitution is not one of them. If
u equals cos x, then du is not here. The successful methods are integration by parts

and double-angle formulas. Both answers are in equation (2) below-I don't see
either one as the obvious winner.
Integrating cos2x by parts was Example 3 of Section 7.1. The other approach, by
double angles, is based on these formulas from trigonometry:
cos2x = f (1 + cos 2x)

sin2x = f(1- cos 2x)

(1)

The integral of cos 2x is 5 sin 2x. So these formulas can be integrated directly. They
give the only integrals you should memorize-either the integration by parts form,
or the result from these double angles:

1sin2x dx equals

(2)

$(x - sin x cos x)

or

f x - & sin 2x (plus C).

(3)

cos2x dx equals )(x

(m = 0,n = 4, both are even)

Changing cos2x to 1 - sin2x gets us nowhere. All exponents stay even. Substituting
u = sin x won't simplify sin4x dx, without du. Integrate by parts or switch to 2x.
First solution Integrate by parts.

Take u = cos3x and dv = cos x dx:

1(cos3x)(cosx dx) = uv - j v du = cos3x sin x - j (sin x)(- 3 cos2x sin x dx).
The last integral has even powers sin2x and cos2x. This looks like no progress.
Replacing sin2x by 1 - cos2x produces cos4x on the right-hand side also:

J cos4x dx = cos3x sin x + 3 5 cos2x(l - cos2x)dx.

7 Techniques of Integration

Always even powers in the integrals. But now move 3 cos4x dx to the left side:

5

4 cos4x dx = cos3x sin x + 3 cos2x dx.

Reduction

(4)

Partial success-the problem is reduced from cos4x to cos2x. Still an even power,
but a lower power. The integral of cos2x is already known. Use it in equation (4):

I cos4x dx = $ cos3x sin x + 3 f(x + sin x cos x) + C.

(5)

Second solution Substitute the double-angle formula cos2x = 3 + 3 cos 2x:

5

cos4x dx = (f + f cos 2x)'dx

I

=

I (1 + 2 cos 2x + cos2 2x)dx.

I

Certainly dx = x. Also 2 cos 2x dx = sin 2x. That leaves the cosine squared:

I cos22x = I f (1 + cos 4x)dx = f x +

sin 4x + C.

The integral of cos4x using double angles is
$[x

+ sin 2x + f x + $sin 4x1 + C.

That solution looks different from equation (S), but it can't be. There all angles were
x, here we have 2x and 4x. We went from cos4x to cos22x to cos 4x, which was
integrated immediately. The powers were cut in half as the angle was doubled.
Double-angle method for

I sinmxcosnx dx, when m and n are even.

Replace sin2x by f (1 - cos 2x) and cos2x by & I + cos 2x). The exponents drop to
m/2 and n/2. If those are even, repeat the idea (2x goes to 4x). If m/2 or n/2 is odd,
switch to the "general method" using substitution. With an odd power, we have du.
EXAMPLE 5 (Double angle)

I sin2x cos2x dx = I i ( l - cos 2x)(1 + cos 2x)dx.

This leaves 1 - cos2 2x in the last integral. That is familiar but not necessarily easy.
We can look it up (safest) or remember it (quickest) or use double angles again:

Conclusion Every sinmxcosnx can be integrated. This includes negative m and nsee tangents and secants below. Symbolic codes like MACSYMA or Mathematica
give the answer directly. Do they use double angles or integration by parts?
You may prefer the answer from integration by parts (I usually do). It avoids 2x
and 4x. But it makes no sense to go through every step every time. Either a computer
does the algebra, or we use a "reduction formula" from n to n - 2:

dx.
n J cosnx dx = cosn-'x sin x + (n - 1) COS"-~X

Reduction

(7)

I

For n = 2 this is cos2x dx-the integral to learn. For n = 4 the reduction produces
cos2x. The integral of cos6x goes to cos4x. There are similar reduction formulas for
sinmxand also for sinmxcosnx. I don't see a good reason to memorize them.
INTEGRALS WITH ANGLES px AND qx

Instead of sin8x times cos6x, suppose you have sin 8x times cos 6x. How do you
integrate? Separately a sine and cosine are easy. The new question is the integral of
the product:

7.2 Trigonometric Intagrals

EXAMPLE 6

Find

I:"

sin 8x cos 6x dx.

More generallyfind

I:"

sin px cos qx dx.

This is not for the sake of making up new problems. I believe these are the most
important definite integrals in this chapter (p and q are 0, 1,2, ...). They may be the
most important in all of mathematics, especially because the question has such a
beautiful answer. The integrals are zero. On that fact rests the success of Fourier
series, and the whole industry of signal processing.
One approach (the slow way) is to replace sin 8x and cos 6x by powers of cosines.
That involves cos14x. The integration is not fun. A better approach, which applies to
all angles px and qx, is to use the identity
sin px cos qx = f sin(p + q)x + f sin(p - q)x.

(8)

Thus sin 8x cos 6x = f sin 14x + f sin 2x. Separated like that, sines are easy to
integrate:

s i n 8 x c o s 6 x d x = -----=0.

Since cos 14x is periodic, it has the same value at 0 and 2n. Subtraction gives zero.
The same is true for cos 2x. The integral of sine times cosine is always zero over a
complete period (like 0 to 2n).
What about sin px sin qx and cos px cos qx? Their integrals are also zero, provided
p is dinerentfrom q. When p = q we have a perfect square. There is no negative area
to cancel the positive area. The integral of cos2px or sin2px is n.
EXAMPLE 7

I:"

sin 8x sin 7x dx = 0 and

I:"

sin2 8x dx = n.

With two sines or two cosines (instead of sine times cosine), we go back to the
addition formulas of Section 1.5. Problem 24 derives these formulas:
sin px sin qx = - 4 cos(p + q)x + cos(p - q)x
cos px cos qx =

+ cos(p + q)x + 9 cos(p - q)x.

(9)

(10)
With p = 8 and q = 7, we get cos 15x and cos x. Their definite integrals are zero. With
p = 8 and q = 8, we get cos 16x and cos Ox (which is 1). Formulas (9) and (10) also
give a factor f . The integral of f is n:
1:" sin 8x sin 7x dx = - f 1:" cos 15x dx + $I:" cos x dx = 0 + 0
1:" sin 8x sin 8x dx = - )I:"

coCl6x dx + fI:" cos Ox dx = 0 + n

The answer zero is memorable. The answer n appears constantly in Fourier series.
No ordinary numbers are seen in these integrals. The case p = q = 1 brings back
cos2x dx = f + t sin 2x.
SECANTS AND TANGENTS

When we allow negative powers m and n, the main fact remains true. All integrals

I sinmxcosnxdx can be expressed by known functions. The novelty for negative powers is that logarithms appear. That happens right at the start, for sin x/cos x and for
ljcos x (tangent and secant):

I tan x dx = - I duju = - lnlcos x J
I sec x dx = duju = lnlsec x + tan xl

(here u = cos x)
(here u = sec x + tan x).

7 Techniques of Integration

+

For higher powers there is one key identity: 1 tan2x = sec2x. That is the old
identity cos2x + sin2x = 1 in disguise (just divide by cos2x). We switch tangents to
secants just as we switched sines to cosines. Since (tan x)' = sec2x and (sec x)' =
sec x tan x, nothing else comes in.
EXAMPLE 8

[ tan2x dx = [(sec2x - 1)dx = tan x - x + C .

[ tan3x dx = [ tan x(sec2x - 1)dx.
The first integral on the right is [ u du = iu2, with u = tan x. The last integral is
- [ tan x dx. The complete answer is f (tan x ) +

which is urn-'du. This leaves the integral on the right, with the exponent lowered by
2. Every power (tan x)" is eventually reduced to Example 8 or 9.
EXAMPLE II

[ sec3x dx = uv - [ v du = sec x tan x - [ tan2x sec x dx

This was integration by parts, with u = sec x and v = tan x. In the integral on the
right, replace tan2x by sec2x - 1 (this identity is basic):

[ sec3x dx = sec x tan x - [ sec3x dx + [ sec x dx.

I

Bring sec3x dx to the left side. That reduces the problem from sec3x to sec x.
I believe those examples make the point-trigonometric integrals are computable.
Every product tanmxsecnx can be reduced to one of these examples. If n is even we
substitute u = tan x. If m is odd we set u = sec x. If m is even and n is odd, use a
reduction formula (and always use tan2x = sec2x- 1).
I mention very briefly a completely different substitution u = tan i x . This seems to
all students and instructors (quite correctly) to come out of the blue:
2u
sin x = 1 + u2

and

1 - u2
cos x = 1 + u2

and

2du
dx = 1 + u2'

(11)

The x-integral can involve sums as well as products-not only sinmxcosnx but also
1/(5 sin x - tan x). (No square roots.) The u-integral is a ratio of ordinary polynomials. It is done by partial fractions.

Application of j sec x dx to distance on a map (Mercator projection)
The strange integral ln(sec x + tan x) has an everyday application. It measures the
distance from the equator to latitude x, on a Mercator map of the world.
All mapmakers face the impossibility of putting part of a sphere onto a flat page.
You can't preserve distances, when an orange peel is flattened. But angles can be
preserved, and Mercator found a way to do it. His map came before Newton and
Leibniz. Amazingly, and accidentally, somebody matched distances on the map with
a table of logarithms-and discovered sec x dx before calculus. You would not be
surprised to meet sin x, but who would recognize ln(sec x + tan x)?
The map starts with strips at all latitudes x. The heights are dx, the lengths are
proportional to cos x. We stretch the strips by l/cos x-then Figure 7 . 3 ~lines up
evenly on the page. When dx is also divided by cos x, angles are preserved-a small

The distance to the North Pole is infinite! Close to the Pole, maps are stretched
totally out of shape. When sailors wanted to go from A to B at a constant angle with
the North Star, they looked on Mercator's map to find the angle.

Trigonometric Substitutions
The most powerful tool we have, for integrating with pencil and paper and brain, is
the method of substitution. To make it work, we have to think of good substitutionswhich make the integral simpler. This section concentrates on the single most valuable collection of substitutions. They are the only ones you should memorize, and
two examples are given immediately.

The expression J1 - x2 is awkward as a function of x. It becomes graceful as a
function of 8. We are practically invited to use the equation 1 - (sin 0)2 = (COS
Then the square root is simply cos 9-provided this cosine is positive.
Notice the change in dx. When x is sin 8, dx is cos 0 dO. Figure 7.4a shows the
original area with new letters. Figure 7.4b shows an equal area, after rewriting
j (COS B)(COS O dO) as 5 (cos2e)do. Changing from x to 8 gives a new height and a new
base. There is no change in area-that is the point of substitution.
To put it bluntly: If we go from ,,/to cos 0, and forget the difference between
dx and dB, and just compute j cos 0 dB, the answer is totally wrong.

Fig. 7.4

Same area for Jl - x2 dx and cos28 dB. Third area is wrong: dx #dB

We still need the integral of cos20. This was Example 3 of integration by parts, and
also equation 7.2.6. It is worth memorizing. The example shows this 0 integral, and
returns to x:

with a memory from Chapter 4, the substitution x = sin 8 makes the solution automatic. From 5 d8 = 8 we go back to sin-'x.
The rest of this section is about other substitutions. They are more complicated
than x = sin 8 (but closely related). A table will display the three main choices-sin 8,
tan 8, sec 8-and their uses.
TRIGONOMETRIC SUBSTITUTIONS

After working with ,/-,
the next step is -/,.
The change x = sin 8 simplified
the first, but it does nothing for the second: 4 - sin28 is not familiar. Nevertheless a
factor of 2 makes everything work. Instead of x = sin 8, the idea is to substitute x =
2 sin 8:
JF?= JGGG = 2 cos 8 and dx = 2 cos 8 do.
Notice both 2's. The integral is 4 1cos28dB = 2 sin 8 cos 8 + 28. But watch closely.
This is not 4 times the previous 1cos28do! Since x is 2 sin 8, 8 is now sin- '(~12).

Substitute

dx=acos8d8.

That is the automatic substitution to try, whenever the square root appears.

Here a2 = 16. Then a = 4 and x = 4 sin 8. The integral has 4 cos 8 above and below,
so it is 1dB. The antiderivative is just 8. For the definite integral notice that x = 4
means sin 8 = 1, and this means 8 = 7112.
A table of integrals would hide that substitution. The table only gives sin-'(~14).
There is no mention of 1d8 = 8. But what if 16 - x2 changes to x2 - 16?

1x=4
,/FX
8

EXAMPLE 5

dx

=?

Notice the two changes-the sign in the square root and the limits on x. Example 4
stayed inside the interval 1x1 < 4, where 16 - x2 has a square root. Example 5 stays
outside, where x2 - 16 has a square root. The new problem cannot use x = 4 sin 8,
because we don't want the square root of -cos28.
The new substitution is x = 4 sec 8. This turns the square root into 4 tan 8:

x = 4 sec 8 gives d x = 4 sec 8 tan 8 d8 and x2 - 16= 16sec28- 16= 16 tan2@.
This substitution solves the example, when the limits are changed to 8:
!:I3

4 sec 8 tan do 4 tan 8

Jy3

sec8d8=ln(~ec8+tan8)]~~=ln(2+fi).

I want to emphasize the three steps. First came the substitution x = 4 sec 8. An
unrecognizable integral became sec 6 dB. Second came the new limits (8 = 0 when
x = 4, 8 = 7113 when x = 8). Then I integrated sec 8.

297

7.3 Trigonometric Substitutions
Example 6 has the same x 2 - 16. So the substitution is again x = 4 sec 8:

Step one substitutes x = 4 sec 0. Step two changes the limits to 0. The upper limit
x = oo becomes 0 = in/2, where the secant is infinite. The limit x = 8 again means 0 =
7r/3. To get a grip on the integral, I also changed to sines and cosines.
The integral of cos 6/sin20 needs another substitution! (Or else recognize
cot 0 csc 0.) With u = sin 0 we have f du/u 2 = - 1/u = - 1/sin 8:

Warning With lower limit 0 = 0 (or x = 4) this integral would be a disaster. It divides
by sin 0, which is zero. This area is infinite.
(Warning)2 Example 5 also blew up at x = 4, but the area was not infinite. To make
the point directly, compare x-- 1/2 to x- 3/ 2 . Both blow up at x = 0, but the first one
has finite area:

Section 7.5 separates finite areas (slow growth of 1/ x) from infinite areas (fast
growth of x-3/2).
Last substitution Together with 16 - x 2 and x 2 - 16 comes the possibility 16 + x 2.
(You might ask about -16 - x2 , but for obvious reasons we don't take its square
root.) This third form 16 + x 2 requires a third substitution x = 4 tan 0. Then
16 + x 2 = 16 + 16 tan20 = 16 sec 20. Here is an example:

in Example 1, dx was replaced by cos 0 dO (new method)
in Example 6, cos 0 dO was already there and became du (old method).
The combination cos 0 dO was put into the first and pulled out of the second.
My point is that Chapter 5 needed du/dx inside the integral. Then (du/dx)dx
became du. Now it is not necessary to see so far ahead. We can try any substitution.
If it works, we win. In this section, x = sin 0 or sec 0 or tan 0 is bound to succeed.

We mention the hyperbolic substitutions tanh 8, sinh 8, and cosh 8. The table below
shows their use. They give new forms for the same integrals. If you are familiar with
hyperbolic functions the new form might look simpler-as it does in Example 8.
x = a tanh8 replaces a2 - x2 by a2 sech28 and dx by a sech28 dB
x = a sinh8 replaces a2 + x2 by a2 cosh28 and dx by a cosh 8 d8

COMPLETING THE SQUARE

Jm

We have not said what to do for
or.-/,
Those square roots
contain a linear term-a multiple of x. The device for removing linear terms is worth
knowing. It is called completing the square, and two examples will begin to explain it:
1=u2+ 1

x2-2x+2=(x-

The idea has three steps. First, get the x2 and x terms into one square. Here that
square was (x - 1)2= x2 - 2x + 1. Second, fix up the constant term. Here we recover
the original functions by adding 1. Third, set u = x - 1 to leave no linear term. Then
the integral goes forward based on the substitutions of this section:

The same idea applies to any quadratic that contains a linear term 2bx:
x2 + 2bx + c as

rewrite
rewrite

-

x2 + 2bx + c as

(x + b)2 + C , with C = c - b2
-

(x - b)2 + C , with C = c + b2

To match the quadratic with the square, we fix up the constant:
x2

+ lox + 1 6 =

(x + 5)2+ C leads to C = 16 - 25 = - 9

- x 2 + l o x + 1 6 = - ( x - 5)* + C leads to C = 1 6 + 2 5 = 4 1 .
EXAMPLE 9

Here u = x + 5 and du = dx. Now comes a choice-struggle on with u = 3 sec 0 or
look for du/(u2- a') inside the front cover. Then set a = 3:

Note If the quadratic starts with 5x2 or -5x2, factor out the 5 first:

+ 25 = 5(x2- 2x + 5) = (complete the square) = 5[(x - + 41.
Now u = x - 1 produces 5[u2 + 41. This is ready for table lookup or u = 2 tan 8:
5x2- lox

This answer is 8/10 C. Now go backwards: 8/10 = (tan- f u)/lO = (tan- f(x - -))/lo.
Nobody could see that from the start. A double substitution takes practice, from x
to u to 8. Then go backwards from 8 to u to x.
Final remark For u2 + aZ we substitute u = a tan 8. For u2 - a2 we substitute u =
a sec 8. This big dividing line depends on whether the constant C (after completing
the square) is positive or negative. We either have C = a* or C = - a2. The same
dividing line in the original x2 + 2bx + c is between c > b2 and c < b2. In between,
c = b2 yields the perfect square (x + b)'and no trigonometric substitution at all.

7.4 Partial Fractions

This section is about rational functions P(x)/Q(x).Sometimes their integrals are also
rational functions (ratios of polynomials). More often they are not. It is very common
for the integral of PIQ to involve logarithms. We meet logarithms immediately in the

to the same

7.4

Pattial Fractions

simple case l/(x - 2), whose integral is lnlx - 21 + C. We meet them again in a sum
of simple cases:

Our plan is to split PIQ into a sum like this-and integrate each piece.
Which rational function produced that particular sum? It was

This is PIQ. It is a ratio of polynomials, degree 1 over degree 3. The pieces of P are
collected into -4x 16. The common denominator (x - 2)(x + 2)(x) = x3 - 4x is Q.
But I kept these factors separate, for the following reason. When we start with PIQ,
and break it into a sum of pieces, thefirst things we need are the factors of Q.

+

In the standard problem PIQ is given. To integrate it, we break it up. The goal of
partial fractions is to find the pieces-to prepare for integration. That is the technique
to learn in this section, and we start right away with examples.
EXAMPLE 1 Suppose PIQ has the same Q but a different numerator P:

Notice the form of those pieces! They are the "partial fractions" that add to PIQ.
Each one is a constant divided by a factor of Q. We know the factors x - 2 and x + 2
and x. We don't know the constants A, B, C. In the previous case they were 1,3, - 4.
In this and other examples, there are two ways to find them.
Method 1(slow) Put the right side of (1) over the common denominator Q:

Why is A multiplied by (x + 2)(x)? Because canceling those factors will leave A/(x - 2)
as in equation (1). Similarly we have B/(x 2) and Clx. Choose the numbers A, B, C
so that the numerators match. As soon as they agree, the splitting is correct.

+

Method 2 (quicker) Multiply equation (1) by x - 2. That leaves a space:

Now set x = 2 and immediately you have A. The last two terms of (3) are zero, because
x - 2 is zero when x = 2. On the left side, x = 2 gives

Notice how multiplying by x - 2 produced a hole on the left side. Method 2 is the
"cover-up method." Cover up x - 2 and then substitute x = 2. The result is 3 =
A + 0 + 0, just what we wanted.
In Method 1, the numerators of equation (2) must agree. The factors that multiply
B and C are again zero at x = 2. That leads to the same A-but the cover-up method
avoids the unnecessary step of writing down equation (2).

302

7 Techniques of Integration

Calculation ofB

Multiply equation (1) by x + 2, which covers up the (x + 2):

Now set x = - 2, so A and C are multiplied by zero:

This is almost full speed, but (4) was not needed. Just cover up in Q and give x the
right value (which makes the covered factor zero).
Calculation of C (quickest) In equation (I), cover up the factor (x) and set x = 0:

To repeat: The same result A = 3, B = - 1, C = 1 comes from Method 1.
EXAMPLE 2

First cover up (x - 1) on the left and set x = 1. Next cover up (x + 3) and set x = - 3:

The integral is tlnlx - 11 + ilnlx

+ 31 + C.

EXAMPLE 3 This was needed for the logistic equation in Section 6.5:

1
A
~(~-by)-;

+-c -Bby'

First multiply by y. That covers up y in the first two terms and changes B to By.
Then set y = 0. The equation becomes l/c = A.
To find B, multiply by c - by. That covers up c - by in the outside terms. In the
middle, A times c - by will be zero at y = clb. That leaves B on the right equal to
l/y = blc on the left. Then A = llc and B = blc give the integral announced in
Equation 6.5.9:

It is time to admit that the general method of partial fractions can be very awkward.
First of all, it requires the factors of the denominator Q. When Q is a quadratic
ax2 + bx + c, we can find its roots and its factors. In theory a cubic or a quartic can
also be factored, but in practice only a few are possible-for example x4 - 1 is
(x2 - 1)(x2+ 1). Even for this good example, two of the roots are imaginary. We can
split x2 - 1 into (x + l)(x - 1). We cannot split x2 + 1 without introducing i.
The method of partial fractions can work directly with x2 + 1, as we now see.
EXAMPLE 4

dx (a quadratic over a quadratic).

This has another difficulty. The degree of P equals the degree of Q (= 2). Partial

7.4 Partial Fractions

jiactions cannot start until P has lower degree. Therefore I divide the leading term x2
into the leading term 3x2. That gives 3, which is separated off by itself:

Note how 3 really used 3x2 + 3 from the original numerator. That left 2x + 4. Partial
fractions will accept a linear factor 2x + 4 (or Ax + B, not just A) above a quadratic.
This example contains 2x/(x2 + I), which integrates to ln(x2 + 1). The final
4/(x2 + 1) integrates to 4 tan-'x. When the denominator is x2 + x + 1 we complete
the square before integrating. The point of Sections 7.2 and 7.3 was to make that
integration possible. This section gets the fraction ready-in parts.
The essential point is that we never have to go higher than quadratics. Every
denominator Q can be split into linear factors and quadratic factors. There is no magic
way to find those factors, and most examples begin by giving them. They go into
their own fractions, and they have their own numerators-which are the A and B
and 2x + 4 we have been computing.
The one remaining question is what to do if a factor is repeated. This happens in
Example 5.
EXAMPLE 5

The key is the new term B/(x That is the right form to expect. With (x - l)(x - 2)
this term would have been B/(x - 2). But when (x - 1) is repeated, something new is
and set x = 1:
needed. To find B, multiply through by (x 2 x + 3 = A(x- 1)+ B becomes 5 = B when x = 1.
This cover-up method gives B. Then A = 2 is easy, and the integral is
2 lnlx - 11 - 5/(x - 1). The fraction 5/(x - 1)2 has an integral without logarithms.
EXAMPLE 6

This final example has almost everything! It is more of a game than a calculus
problem. In fact calculus doesn't enter until we integrate (and nothing is new there).
Before computing A, B, C, D, E, we write down the overall rules for partial fractions:
The degree of P must be less than the degree of Q. Otherwise divide their leading
terms as in equation (8) to lower the degree of P. Here 3 < 5.
Expect the fractions illustrated by Example 6. The linear factors x and x + 1
(and the repeated x2) are underneath constants. The quadratic x2 + 4 is under a
linear term. A repeated (x2 + 4)2 would be under a new Fx + G.
Find the numbers A, B, C, ... by any means, including cover-up.
Integrate each term separately and add.
We could prove that this method always works. It makes better sense to show that
it works once, in Example 6.
To find E, cover up (x - 1) on the left and substitute x = 1. Then E = 3.
To find B, cover up x2 on the left and set x = 0. Then B = 4/(0 + 4)(0 - 1) = - 1.
The cover-up method has done its job, and there are several ways to find A, C, D.

303

7 Techniques of Integration

Compare the numerators, after multiplying through by the common denominator Q:
The known terms on the right, from B = - 1 and E = 3, can move to the left:
We can divide through by x and x - 1, which checks that B and E were correct:

+ 4) + (Cx + D)x.
yields A = - 1. This leaves - 2x2 = (Cx + D)x. Then
- 3x2 - 4 = A(x2

C = - 2 and
Finally x = 0
D=O.
You should never have to do such a problem! I never intend to do another one.
It completely depends on expecting the right form and matching the numerators.
They could also be matched by comparing coefficients of x4, x3, x2, x, 1-to give five
equations for A, B, C, D, E. That is an invitation to human error. Cover-up is the
way to start, and usually the way to finish. With repeated factors and quadratic
factors, match numerators at the end.

7.4 EXERCISES
Read-through questions
The idea of a fractions is to express P(x)/Q(x)as a b
of simpler terms, each one easy to integrate. To begin, the
degree of P should be c the degree of Q. Then Q is split
into d factors like x - 5 (possibly repeated) and quadratic
factors like x2 + x + 1 (possibly repeated). The quadratic
factors have two e roots, and do not allow real linear
factors.
A factor like x - 5 contributes a fraction A/ f . Its
h
in the
integral is g . To compute A, cover up
denominator of P/Q. Then set x = i , and the rest of
P/Q becomes A. An equivalent method puts all fractions over
I ). Then match the
a common denominator (which is
k . At the same point x =
I
this matching gives A.
A repeated linear factor (x - 5)2 contributes not only
A/(x - 5) but also B/ m . A quadratic factor like x2 + x + 1
contributes a fraction n /(x2 + x 1) involving C and D.
A repeated quadratic factor or a triple linear factor would
bring in (Ex + F)/(x2+ x +
or G/(x - 5)3. The conclusion
is that any PIQ can be split into partial o , which can
always be integrated.

"Zmp~oper"means that some part of y(x)dx becomes infinite. It might be b or a or
the function y. The region under the graph reaches infinitely far-to the right or left
or up or down. (Those come from b = oo and a = - oo and y + oo and y -, - oo.)
Nevertheless the integral may "converge." Just because the region is infinite, it is not
automatic that the area is infinite. That is the point of this section-to decide when
improper integrals have proper answers.
The first examples show finite area when b = oo, then a = - m , then y = I/& at
x = 0.The areas in Figure 7.6 are 1, 1,2:

Fig. 7.6 The shaded areas are finite but the regions go to infinity.

306

7 Techniques of Integration

In practice we substitute the dangerous limits and watch what happens. When the
integral is -1/x, substituting b = oo gives "- 1/oo = 0." When the integral is ex,
substituting a = - oo gives "e-" = 0." I think that is fair, and I know it is successful.
But it is not completely precise.
The strict rules involve a limit. Calculus sneaks up on 1/oo and e-" just as it
sneaks up on 0/0. Instead of swallowing an infinite region all at once, the formal
definitions push out to the limit:

The conclusion is the same. The first examples converged to 1, 1, 2. Now come two
more examples going out to b = oo:
The area under 1/x is infinite:

(2)

The area under 1/x is like 1 + I + - + + -,which is also infinite. In fact the sum
approximates the integral-the curved area is close to the rectangular area. They go
together (slowly to infinity).
A larger p brings the graph more quickly to zero. Figure 7.7a shows a finite area
1/(p - 1)= 100. The region is still infinite, but we can cover it with strips cut out of
a square! The borderline for finite area is p = 1. I call it the borderline, but p = 1 is
strictly on the side of divergence.
The borderline is also p = 1 when the function climbs the y axis. At x = 0, the graph
of y = 1/x P goes to infinity. For p = 1, the area under 1/x is again infinite. But at x =
0 it is a small p (meaning p < 1) that produces finite area:

Loosely speaking "-In 0 = oo." Strictly speaking we integrate from the point x = a
near zero, to get dx/x =- In a. As a approaches zero, the area shows itself as
infinite. For y = 1/x2 , which blows up faster, the area - 1/x]o is again infinite.
For y = 1/ x, the area from 0 to 1 is 2. In that case p = ½. For p = 99/100 the area
is 1/(1 - p) = 100. Approaching p = 1 the borderline in Figure 7.7 seems clear. But
that cutoff is not as sharp as it looks.

Narrower borderline Under the graph of llx, the area is infinite. When we divide
by in x or (ln x ) ~the
, borderline is somewhere in between. One has infinite area (going
out to x = a ) , the other area is finite:

The first is dulu with u = In x. The logarithm of in x does eventually make it to
infinity. At x = 10l0, the logarithm is near 23 and ln(1n x) is near 3. That is slow!
Even slower is ln(ln(1n x)) in Problem 11. No function is exactly on the borderline.
The second integral in equation (4) is convergent (to 1). It is 1du/u2 with u = In x.
At first I wrote it with x going from zero to infinity. That gave an answer I couldn't
believe:

There must be a mistake, because we are integrating a positive function. The area
can't be zero. It is true that l/ln b goes to zero as b + oo. It is also true that l/ln a
goes to zero as a -,0. But there is another infinity in this integral. The trouble is at
x = 1, where In x is zero and the area is infinite.

The area under e-"/x is (-I)! = oo. The factor e-" is absolutely no help at x = 0.
That is an example (the first of many) in which we do not know an antiderivativebut still we get a decision. To integrate e -"/x we need a computer. But to decide that
an improper integral is infinite (in this case) or finite (in other cases), we rely on the
following comparison test:

is smaller than the area under Hx):

Comparison can decide if the area is finite. We don't get the exact area, but we learn
about one function from the other. The trick is to construct a simple function (like
l/xP)which is on one side of the given function-and stays close to it:

Applications of the Integral

We are experts in one application of the integral-to find the area under a curve.
The curve is the graph of y = v(x), extending from x = a at the left to x = b at the
right. The area between the curve and the x axis is the definite integral.
I think of that integral in the following way. The region is made up of thin strips.
Their width is dx and their height is v(x). The area of a strip is v(x) times dx. The
area of all the strips is 1: v(x) dx. Strictly speaking, the area of one strip is
meaningless-genuine rectangles have width Ax. My point is that the picture of thin
strips gives the correct approach.
We know what function to integrate (from the picture). We also know how (from
this course or a calculator). The new applications to volume and length and surface
area cut up the region in new ways. Again the small pieces tell the story. In this
chapter, what to integrate is more important than how.

8.1 Areas and Volumes by Slices
This section starts with areas between curves. Then it moves to volumes, where the
strips become slices. We are weighing a loaf of bread by adding the weights of the
slices. The discussion is dominated by examples and figures-the theory is minimal.
The real problem is to set up the right integral. At the end we look at a different way
of cutting up volumes, into thin shells. All formulas are collected into a j n a l table.
Figure 8.1 shows the area between two curves. The upper curve is the graph of
y = v(x). The lower curve is the graph of y = w(x). The strip height is v(x) - w(x), from
one curve down to the other. The width is dx (speaking informally again). The total
area is the integral of "top minus bottom":
area between two curves =

[v(x) - w(x)] dx.

(1)

EXAMPLE 1 The upper curve is y = 6x (straight line). The lower curve is y = 3x2
(parabola). The area lies between the points where those curves intersect.

To find the intersection points, solve u(x) = w(x) or 6x = 3x2.

Area between curves = integral of v - w. Area in Example 2 starts with x 2 0.

One crossing is at x

= 0,

the other is at x

= 2.

The area is an integral from 0 to 2:

area = jz (v - w) d x = ji ( 6 x - 3 x 2 )d x = 3x2 - x 3 ] ;
EXAMPLE 2

Find the area between the circle v =

= 4.

Jmand the 45" line w

= x.

First question: Which area and what limits? Start with the pie-shaped wedge in
Figure 8.1b. The area begins at the y axis and ends where the circle meets the line.
At the intersection point we have u(x)= w(x):
from

=x

squaring gives 1 - x 2 = x 2 and then 2x2 = 1.

Thus x2 = f . The endpoint is at x

=

1/J2. Now integrate the strip height v - w:

The area is n/8 (one eighth of the circle). To integrate Jp
d x we apply the
techniques of Chapter 7: Set x = sin 0, convert to cos2 0 d0 = f(0 + sin 0 cos O),
convert back using 0 = sin-' x . It is harder than expected, for a familiar shape.
Remark Suppose the problem is to find the whole area between the circle and the
line. The figure shows v = w at two points, which are x = 1/$ (already used) and
also x = - I/$. Instead of starting at x = 0, which gave $ of a circle, we now include
the area to the left.
Main point: Integrating from x = -I/$
to x = 1 / f i will give the wrong answer.
It misses the part of the circle that bulges out over itself, at the far left. In that part,
the strips have height 2v instead of v - w. The figure is essential, to get the correct
area of this half-circle.
HORIZONTAL STRIPS INSTEAD OF VERTICAL STRIPS

There is more than one way to slice a region. Vertical slices give x integrals. Horizontal
slices give y integrals. We have a free choice, and sometimes the y integral is better.

VOLUMES BY SLICES

For the first time in this book, we now look at volumes. The regions are threedimensional solids. There are three coordinates x, y, z-and many ways to cut up a
solid.
Figure 8.3 shows one basic way-using slices. The slices have thickness dx, like
strips in the plane. Instead of the height y of a strip, we now have the area A of a
cross-section. This area is different for different slices: A depends on x. The volume
of the slice is its area times its thickness: dV = A(x) dx. The volume of the whole solid
is the integral:
volume = integral of area times thickness = 1A(x) dx.

(2)
Note An actual slice does not have the same area on both sides! Its thickness is Ax
(not dx). Its volume is approximately A(x) Ax (but not exactly). In the limit, the
thickness approaches zero and the sum of volumes approaches the integral.
For a cylinder all slices are the same. Figure 8.3b shows a cylinder-not circular.
The area is a fixed number A, so integration is trivial. The volume is A times h. The

Fig. 8.3 Cross-sections have area A(x). Volumes are A(x) dx.

8 Applications of the Integral

letter h, which stands for height, reminds us that the cylinder often stands on its end.
Then the slices are horizontal and the y integral or z integral goes from 0 to h.
When the cross-section is a circle, the cylinder has volume nr2h.
EXAMPLE 4

The triangular wedge in Figure 8.3b has constant cross-sections with
area A = f(3)(4) = 6. The volume is 6h.

EXAMPLE 5 For the triangular pyramid in Figure 8.3c, the area A(x) drops from 6
to 0. It is a general rule for pyramids or cones that their volume has an extra factor

f (compared to cylinders). The volume is now 2h instead of 6h. For a cone with base
area nr2, the volume is f nu2h. Tapering the area to zero leaves only f of the volume.
Why the f ? Triangles sliced from the pyramid have shorter sides. Starting from 3
and 4, the side lengths 3(1 - x/h) and 4(1 - x/h) drop to zero at x = h. The area is
A = 6(1 - ~ / h )Notice:
~.
The side lengths go down linearly, the area drops quadratically. The factor f really comes from integrating r2to get i x 3 :

EXAMPLE 6

A half-sphere of radius R has known volume $($nR3). Its cross-sections
are semicircles. The key relation is x2 + r2 = R ~for
, the right triangle in Figure 8.4a.
The area of the semicircle is A = f n r 2 = $n(R2 - x 2 ) . So we integrate A(u):

EXAMPLE 7

Find the volume of the same half-sphere using horizontal slices
(Figure 8.4b). The sphere still has radius R. The new right triangle gives y 2 + r2 = R ~ .
Since we have full circles the area is nr2 = n(R2 - y2). Notice that this is A(y) not
A(x). But the y integral starts at zero:
volume =

SOLIDS OF REVOLUTION

Cones and spheres and circular cylinders are "solids of revolution." Rotating a horizontal line around the x axis gives a cylinder. Rotating a sloping line gives a cone.
Rotating a semicircle gives a sphere. If a circle is moved away from the axis, rotation
produces a torus (a doughnut). The rotation of any curve y =f (x) produces a solid
of revolution.

315

8.1 Areas and Volumes by Slices
The volume of that solid is made easier because every cross-section is a circle. All
slices are pancakes (or pizzas). Rotating the curve y =f(x) around the x axis gives
disks of radius y, so the area is A = cry 2 = r[f(x)] 2 . We add the slices:

a "washer." Its area is the full disk minus the area of the hole:

EXAMPLE 10 (Doughnut sliced into washers) Rotate a circle of radius a around the

of the doughnut (or torus) is 27E2 a 2 b.

8 Applications of the Integral

The outside half of the circle rotates to give the outside of the doughnut. The inside
half gives the hole. The biggest slice (through the center plane) has outer radius b + a
and inner radius b - a.
Shifting over by x, the outer radius is f = b +

Now integrate over the washers to find the volume of the doughnut:

That integral $nu2 is the area of a semicircle. When we set x = a sin 8 the area is

5 a2 cos2 8do. Not for the last time do we meet cos2 8.

The hardest part is visualizing the washers, because a doughnut usually breaks the
other way. A better description is a bagel, sliced the long way to be buttered.
VOLUMES BY CYLINDRICAL SHELLS

Finally we look at a different way of cutting up a solid of revolution. So far it was
cut into slices. The slices were perpendicular to the axis of revolution. Now the cuts
are parallel to the axis, and each piece is a thin cylindrical shell. The new formula
gives the same volume, but the integral to be computed might be easier.
Figure 8.6a shows a solid cone. A shell is inside it. The inner radius is x and the
outer radius is x + dx. The shell is an outer cylinder minus an inner cylinder:
~ h = nx2h + 2nx(ds)h + ~ ( d xh)-~nx2h.
shell volume n(x + d ~h -) nx2

(3)

The term that matters is 2nx(dx)h. The shell volume is essentially 2nx (the distance
around) times dx (the thickness) times h (the height). The volume of the solid comes
from putting together the thin shells:
solid volume = integral of shell volumes =

(4)

This is the central formula of the shell method. The rest is examples.
Remark on this volume formula It is completely typical of integration that ( d ~and
) ~
AX)^ disappear. The reason is this. The number of shells grows like l/Ax. Terms of
order AX)^ add up to a volume of order Ax (approaching zero). The linear term
involving Ax or dx is the one to get right. Its limit gives the integral 2nxh dx. The
key is to build the solid out of shells-and to find the area or volume of each piece.
EXAMPLE I I

Find the volume of a cone (base area nr2, height b) cut into shells.

A tall shell at the center has h near b. A short shell at the outside has h near zero. In
between the shell height h decreases linearly, reaching zero at x = r. The height in
Figure 8.6a is h = b - bxlr. Integrating over all shells gives the volume of the cone
(with the expected i):

EXAMPLE 12

Bore a hole of radius a through a sphere of radius b > a.

The hole removes all points out to x = a, where the shells begin. The height of the
shell is h = 2b 2 - x 2 . (The key is the right triangle in Figure 8.6b. The height upward
is b2 - x 2-this is half the height of the shell.) Therefore the sphere-with-hole has
volume = fb 27nxh dx = fb 4cxx b2 - x2 dx.
With u = b2 - x 2 we almost see du. Multiplying du = - 2x dx is an extra factor - 2n:

Question What if the sphere-with-hole is cut into slices instead of shells?
Answer Horizontal slices are washers (Problem 66). Vertical slices are not good.

Rotate the parabola y = x 2 around the y axis to form a bowl.

We go out to x = 2/ (and up to y = 2). The shells in Figure 8.6c have height

8 Applications of the Integral

Which to use, slices or shells? Start with a vertical line going up to y = cos x. Rotating
the line around the x axis produces a slice (a circular disk). The radius is cos x.
Rotating the line around the y axis produces a shell (the outside of a cylinder). The
height is cos x. See Figure 8.7 for the slice and the shell. For volumes we just integrate
7r cos2x dx (the slice volume) or 27rx cos x dx (the shell volume).
This is the normal choice-slices through the x axis and shells around the y axis.
Then y =f (x) gives the disk radius and the shell height. The slice is a washer instead
of a disk if there is also an inner radius g(x). No problem-just integrate small
volumes.
What if you use slices for rotation around the y axis? The disks are in Figure 8.7b,
and their radius is x. This is x = cos- y in the example. It is x =f - '(y) in general.
You have to solve y =f (x) to find x in terms of y. Similarly for shells around the x
axis: The length of the shell is x =f - (y). Integrating may be difficult or impossible.
When y = cos x is rotated around the x axis, here are the choices for volume:

(good by slices) j n cos2x dx

(bad by shells) 5 2ny cos - y dy.

Slices through x axis and shells around y axis (good). The opposite way needs f - (y).

Length of a Plane Curve
The graph of y = x3I2 is a curve in the x-y plane. How long is that curve? A definite
integral needs endpoints, and we specify x = 0 and x = 4. The first problem is to know
what "length function" to integrate.
The distance along a curve is the arc length. To set up an integral, we break the

8.2 Length of a Plane Curue

problem into small pieces. Roughly speaking, smallpieces of a smooth curve are nearly
straight. We know the exact length As of a straight piece, and Figure 8.8 shows how
it comes close to a curved piece.

Fig. 8.8 Length As of short straight segment. Length ds of very short curved segment.

Here is the unofficial reasoning that gives the length of the curve. A straight piece
has (As)2= (AX)' (AY)~.Within that right triangle, the height Ay is the slope
(AylAx) times Ax. This secant slope is close to the slope of the curve. Thus Ay is
approximately (dyldx) Ax.

You may not approve of those numbers (or the reasoning behind them). We can
fix the reasoning, but nothing can be done about the numbers. This example y = x3/'
had to be chosen carefully to make the integration possible at all. The length integral
is difficult because of the square root. In most cases we integrate numerically.

We return briefly to the reasoning. The curve is the graph of y =f (x). Each piece
contains at least one point where secant slope equals tangent slope: AylAx =ft(c).
The Mean Value Theorem applies when the slope is continuous-this is required
for a smooth curve. The straight length As is exactly J(Ax)' + (ft(c)Ax)'. Adding

That integral can't be done in closed form. The length of an ellipse can only be

LENGTH OF A CURVE FROM PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS: x(t) AND y(t)

We have met the unit circle in two forms. One is x2 + y2 = 1. The other is x = cos t,
y = sin t . Since cos2 t + sin2 t = 1, this point goes around the correct circle. One advantage of the "parameter" t is to give extra information-it tells where the point is and

8.2

Length of a Plane Curve

also when. In Chapter 1, the parameter was the time and also the angle-because
we moved around the circle with speed 1.
Using t is a natural way to give the position of a particle or a spacecraft. We can
recover the velocity if we know x and y at every time t. An equation y =f(x) tells the
shape of the path, not the speed along it.
Chapter 12 deals with parametric equations for curves. Here we concentrate on
the path length-which allows you to see the idea of a parameter t without too much
detail. We give x as a function of t and y as a function of t. The curve is still
approximated by straight pieces, and each piece has (As)2 = (Ax)2 + (Ay)2. But instead
of using Ay - (dy/dx) Ax, we approximate Ax and Ay separately:
Ax x (dx/dt) At,

Ay - (dy/dt) At,

As ;

The integral is simpler than 1/
/1x 2, and there is one new advantage. We can
integrate around a whole circle with no trouble. Parametric equations allow a path to
close up or even cross itself. The time t keeps going and the point (x(t), y(t)) keeps
moving. In contrast, curves y =f(x) are limited to one y for each x.
EXAMPLE
6 Find the length of the quarter-ellipse: x = cos t and y = /2 sin t:
On this path y 2 + 2x 2 is 2 sin2 t + 2 cos 2 t = 2 (same ellipse). The non-parametric
equation y = /2 - 2x 2 comes from eliminating t. We keep t:

This integral (7) must equal (5). If one cannot be done, neither can the other. They
are related by x = cos t, but (7) does not blow up at the endpoints. The trapezoidal
rule gives 1.9101 with less than 100 intervals. Section 5.8 mentioned that calculators
automatically do a substitution that makes (5) more like (7).
EXAMPLE
7 The path x= t2, y = t3 goes from (0, 0) to (4, 8). Stop at t = 2.
To find this path without the parameter t, first solve for t = x1 / 2. Then substitute
into the equation for y: y = t3 = x 3 /2 . The non-parametricform (with t eliminated) is
the same curve y = x 3/ 2 as in Example 1.
The length from the t-integral equals the length from the x-integral. This is
Problem 22.
EXAMPLE
8 Special choice of parameter: t is x. The curve becomes x = t, y = t3/ 2 .
If x = t then dx/dt = 1. The square root in (6) is the same as the square root in (4).
Thus the non-parametric form y =f(x) is a special case of the parametric form-just
take t = x.
Compare x = t, y = t3/ 2 with x = t 2 , y = t 3 . Same curve, same length, different speed.

8.3 Area of a Surface of Revolution
This section starts by constructing surfaces. A curve y =f (x) is revolved around an
axis. That produces a "surface of revolution," which is symmetric around the axis. If
we revolve a sloping line, the result is a cone. When the line is parallel to the axis we
get a cylinder (a pipe). By revolving a curve we might get a lamp or a lamp shade
(or even the light bulb).
Secti.on8.1 computed the volume inside that surface. This section computes the
surface area. Previously we cut the solid into slices or shells. Now we need a good
way to cut up the surface.
The key idea is to revolve short straight line segments. Their slope is Ay/Ax. They
can be the same pieces of length As that were used to find length-now we compute
area. When revolved, a straight piece produces a "thinban&' (Figure 8.10). The curved
surface, from revolving y =f (x), is close to the bands. The first step is to compute the
surface area of a band.
A small comment: Curved surfaces can also be cut into tiny patches. Each patch
is nearly flat, like a little square. The sum of those patches leads to a double integral
(with dx dy). Here the integral stays one-dimensional (dx or dy or dt). Surfaces of
revolution are special-we approximatz them by bands that go all the way around.
A band is just a belt with a slope, and its slope has an effect on its area.

8 Applications of the Integral

Revolve a small straight piece (length As not Ax). The center of the piece goes
around a circle of radius r. The band is a slice of a cone. When we flatten it out
(Problems 11- 13) we discover its area. The area is the side length As times the middle
circumference 2nr :
The surface area of a band is 2nrAs = 2nr dl+( A ~ / A x Ax.
)~

For revolution around the y axis, the radius is r = x. For revolution around the x
axis, the radius is the height: r = y =f (x). Figure 8.10 shows both bands-the problem
tells us which to use. The sum of band areas 2nr As is close to the area S of the curved
surface. In the limit we integrate 2nr ds:

8.4 Probability and Calculus
Discrete probability usually involves careful counting. Not many samples are taken
and not many experiments are made. There is a list of possible outcomes, and a
known probability for each outcome. But probabilities go far beyond red cards and
black cards. The real questions are much more practical:

1. How often will too many passengers arrive for a flight?
2. How many random errors do you make on a quiz?
3. What is the chance of exactly one winner in a big lottery?
Those are important questions and we will set up models to answer them.
There is another point. Discrete models do not involve calculus. The number of
errors or bumped passengers or lottery winners is a small whole number. Calculus
enters for continuous probability. Instead of results that exactly equal 1 or 2 or 3,
calculus deals with results that fall in a range of numbers. Continuous probability
comes up in at least two ways:
(A) An experiment is repeated many times and we take averages.
(B) The outcome lies anywhere in an interval of numbers.
In the continuous case, the probability p, of hitting a particular value x = n becomes
zero. Instead we have a probability density p(x)-which is a key idea. The chance that
a random X falls between a and b is found by integrating the density p(x):
Roughly speaking, p(x) d x is the chance of falling between x and x + dx. Certainly
p(x) 2 0. If a and b are the extreme limits - co and a,including all possible outcomes,
the probability is necessarily one:
This is a case where infinite limits of integration are natural and unavoidable. In
studying probability they create no difficulty-areas out to infinity are often easier.
Here are typical questions involving continuous probability and calculus:
4. How conclusive is a 53%-47% poll of 2500 voters?
5. Are 16 random football players safe on an elevator with capacity 3600 pounds?
6. How long before your car is in an accident?

It is not so traditional for a calculus course to study these questions. They need extra
thought, beyond computing integrals (so this section is harder than average). But
probability is more important than some traditional topics, and also more interesting.

8.4

PlobabllHy and Calculus

Drug testing and gene identification and market research are major applications.
Comparing Questions 1-3 with 4-6 brings out the relation of discrete to continuousthe differences between them, and the parallels.
It would be impossible to give here a full treatment of probability theory. I believe
you will see the point (and the use of calculus) from our examples. Frank Morgan's
lectures have been a valuable guide.
DISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLES

A discrete random variable X has a list of possible values. For two dice the outcomes
are X = 2,3, ..., 12. For coin tosses (see below), the list is infinite: X = 1,2,3, ....
A continuous variable lies in an interval a < X d b.
EXAMPLE 1 Toss a fair coin until heads come up. The outcome X is the number of
tosses. The value of X is 1 or 2 or 3 or ..., and the probability is i that X = 1 (heads
on the first toss). The probability of tails then heads is p2 = The probability that
X = n is p,, = (&"-this is the chance of n - 1 tails followed by heads. The sum of all
probabilities is necessarily 1:

a.

EXAMPLE 2 Suppose a student (not you) makes an average of 2 unforced errors per
hour exam. The number of actual errors on the next exam is X = 0 or 1 or 2 or ....
A reasonable model for the probability of n errors-when they are random and
independent-is the Poisson model (pronounced Pwason):
2"

p,, = probability of n errors = 7 e- '.
n.
The probabilities of no errors, one error, and two errors are po, pl, and p,:

The probability of more than two errors is 1 - .I35 - .27 - .27 = .325.
This Poisson model can be derived theoretically or tested experimentally. The total
probability is again 1, from the infinite series (Section 6.6) for e2:

EXAMPLE 3 Suppose on average 3 out of 100 passengers with reservations don't
show up for a flight. If the plane holds 98 passengers, what is the probability that
someone will be bumped!

If the passengers come independently to the airport, use the Poisson model with 2
changed to 3. X is the number of no-shows, and X = n happens with probability pn:

There are 98 seats and 100 reservations. Someone is bumped if X = 0 or X = 1:
chance of bumping = po + p1

=e-

+ 3e-

x 4/20.

We will soon define the average or expected value or mean of X-this

model has p = 3.

CONTINUOUS RANDOM VARIABLES

If X is the lifetime of a VCR, all numbers X 2 0 are possible. If X is a score on the
SAT, then 200 < X < 800. If X is the fraction of computer owners in a poll of 600
people, X is between 0 and 1. You may object that the SAT score is a whole number
and the fraction of computer owners must be 0 or 11600 or 21600 or .... But it is
completely impractical to work with 601 discrete possibilities. Instead we take X to
be a continuous random variable, falling anywhere in the range X 2 0 or [200,800] or
0 < X < 1. Of course the various values of X are not equally probable.
EXAMPLE 4 The average lifetime of a VCR is 4 years. A reasonable model for breakdown time is an exponential random variable. Its probability density is

p(x) = ae-"I4

for 0 < x < GO.

The probability that the VCR will eventually break is 1:

The probability of breakdown within 12 years (X from 0 to 12) is .95:

An exponential distribution has p(x) = ae-"". Its integral from 0 to x is F(x) =
1 - e - a x . Figure 8.1 1 is the graph for a = 1. It shows the area up to x = 1.
To repeat: The probability that a < X < b is the integral of p(x) from a to b.

Fig. 8.11 Probabilities add to C p,, = 1. Continuous density integrates to p(x) d x = 1.

EXAMPLE 5 We now define the most important density function. Suppose the
average SAT score is 500, and the standard deviation (defined below-it measures the
spread around the average) is 200. Then the normal distribution of grades has

This is the normal (or Gaussian) distribution with mean 500 and standard deviation
200. The graph of p(x) is the famous bell-shaped curve in Figure 8.12.
A new objection is possible. The actual scores are between 200 and 800, while the
density p(x) extends all the way from - a0 to m. I think the Educational Testing
Service counts all scores over 800 as 800. The fraction of such scores is pretty smallin fact the normal distribution gives

The bell-shaped graph of p is symmetric around the middle point x = p. The width
of the graph is governed by the second parameter a-which stretches the x axis and
shrinks the y axis (leaving total area equal to 1). The axes are labeled to show the
standard case p = 0, a = 1 and also the graph for any other p and a.
We now give a name to the integral of p(x). The limits will be - co and x, so the
integral F(x) measures the probability that a random sample is below x:
Prob {X < x] =

p(x) dx = cumulative density function F(x).

F(x) accumulates the probabilities given by p(x), so dF/dx = p(x). The total probability is F(co) = 1. This integral from - co to..co covers all outcomes.
Figure 8.12b shows the integral of the bell-shaped normal distribution. The middle
point x = p has F = ). By symmetry there is a 50-50 chance of an outcome below the
mean. The cumulative density F(x) is near .l6 at p - a and near .84 at p a. The
chance of falling in between is .84 - .16 = .68. Thus 68% of the outcomes are less
than one deviation a away from the center p.
Moving out to p - 20 and p + 20, 95% of the area is in between. With 95%
confidence X is less than two deviations from the mean. Only one sample in 20 is
further out (less than one in 40 on each side).
Note that a = 200 is not the precise value for the SAT!

MEAN, VARIANCE, AND STANDARD DEVIATION

In Example 1, X was the number of coin tosses until the appearance of heads. The
probabilities were p1 = $, p, = p3 = Q, .... What is the average number of tosses?
We now find the "mean" p of any distribution p(x)-not only the normal distribution,
where symmetry guarantees that the built-in number p is the mean.
To find p, multiply outcomes by probabilities and add:

The average number of tosses is l ( f ) 2($) 3(i) + .-.. This series adds up (in
Section 10.1) to p = 2. Please do the experiment 10 times. I am almost certain that
the average will be near 2.
When the average is A = 2 quiz errors or 3, = 3 no-shows, the Poisson probabilities
are pn = Ane-vn! Check that the formula p = X np, does give 3, as the mean:

For continuous probability, the sum p = X np, changes to p = j xp(x) dx. We
multiply outcome x by probability p(x) and integrate. In the VCR model, integration
by parts gives a mean breakdown time of p = 4 years:

Together with the mean we introduce the variance. It is always written 02, and in
the normal distribution that measured the "width" of the curve. When a 2 was 2002,
SAT scores spread out pretty far. If the testing service changed to o2 = 12,the scores
would be a disaster. 95% of them would be within + 2 of the mean. When a teacher
announces an average grade of 72, the variance should also be announced-if it is
big then those with 60 can relax. At least they have company.

THE LAW OF AVERAGES AND THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM

We come to the center of probability theory (without intending to give proofs). The
key idea is to repeat an experiment many times-poll many voters, or toss many
dice, or play considerable poker. Each independent experiment produces an outcome
X, and the average from N experiments is R. It is called "X bar":

8 =XI + X,

+ ... + X ,
N

= average

outcome.

All we know about p(x) is its mean p and variance a2. It is amazing how much
information that gives about the average 8 :

No matter what the probabilities for X, the probabilities for R move toward the normal
bell-shaped curve. The standard deviation is close to a / f i when the experiment is
repeated N times. In the Law of Averages, "almost sure" means that the chance of
R not approaching p is zero. It can happen, but it won't.
Remark 1 The Boston Globe doesn't understand the Law of Averages. I quote from
September 1988: "What would happen if a giant Red Sox slump arrived? What would
happen if the fabled Law of Averages came into play, reversing all those can't miss
decisions during the winning streak?" They think the Law of Averages evens everything up, favoring heads after a series of tails. See Problem 20.
EXAMPLE 7

Yes-no poll of N = 2500 voters. Is a 53%-47% outcome conclusive?

The fraction p of "yes" voters in the whole population is not known. That is the reason
for the poll. The deviation a = ,/=
is also not known, but for one voter this is
never more than (when p = f). Therefore a l p for 2500 voters is no larger than
+/,/%,
which is 1%.
The result of the poll was R = 53%. With 95% confidence, this sample is within
two standard deviations (here 2%) of its mean. Therefore with 95% confidence, the
unknown mean p = p of the whole population is between 51% and 55%. This p~11is
conclusive.
If the true mean had been p = 50%, the poll would have had only a ,0013 chance
of reaching 53%. The error margin on each side of a poll is amazingly simple; it is
always I/*.

*

Remark 2 The New York Times has better mathematicians than the Globe. Two
days after Bush defeated Dukakis, their poll of N = 11,645 voters was printed with
the following explanation. "In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 [there is 95%] the results
should differ by no more than one percentage point [there is 1 / a ] from what
would have been obtained by seeking out all voters in the United States."
EXAMPLE 8 Football players at Caltech (if any) have average weight p = 210 pounds
and standard deviation a = 30 pounds. Are N = 16 players safe on an elevator with
capacity 3600 pounds? 16 times 210 is 3360.

8 Applications of the Integral

The average weight is approximately a normal random variable with ji = 210 and
5 = 3 0 / p = 3014. There is only a 2% chance that 8 is above ji + 25 = 225 (see
Figure 8.12b-weights below the mean are no problem on an elevator). Since 16
times 225 is 3600, a statistician would have 98O/0 confidence that the elevator is safe.
This is an example where 98% is not good enough-I wouldn't get on.
EXAMPLE 9 (The famous Weldon Dice) Weldon threw 12 dice 26,306 times and
counted the 5's and 6's. They came up in 33.77% of the 315,672 separate rolls. Thus
= .3377 instead of the expected fraction p = f- of 5's and 6's. Were the dice fair?

The variance in each roll is a2= p(1- p) = 219. The standard deviation of 8 is
6=ajfi =
J315672 z -00084. For fair dice, there is a 95% chance that 8
will differ from f- byless than 26. (For Poisson probabilities that is false. Here R is
normal.) But .3377 differs from .3333 by more than 55. The chance of falling 5 standard
deviations away from the mean is only about 1 in 10,000.t
So the dice were unfair. The faces with 5 or 6 indentations were lighter than the
others, and a little more likely to come up. Modern dice are made to compensate for
that, but Weldon never tried again.

8 Applications of the Integral

8.5 Masses and Moments
This chapter concludes with two sections related to engineering and physics. Each
application starts with a finite number of masses or forces. Their sum is the total
mass or total force. Then comes the "continuous case," in which the mass is spread
out instead of lumped. Its distribution is given by a density function p (Greek rho),
and the sum changes to an integral.
The first step (hardest step?) is to get the physical quantities straight. The second
step is to move from sums to integrals (discrete to continuous, lumped to distributed).
By now we hardly stop to think about it-although this is the key idea of integral
calculus. The third step is to evaluate the integrals. For that we can use substitution
or integration by parts or tables or a computer.
Figure 8.13 shows the one-dimensional case: masses along the x axis. The total
mass is the sum of the masses. The new idea is that of moments-when the mass or
force is multiplied by a distance:

moment of mass around the y axis = mx = (mass) times (distance to axis).

Fig. 8.13 The center of mass is at 2 =(total moment)/(total mass) =average distance.

The figure has masses 1, 3, 2. The total mass is 6. The "lever arms" or "moment
arms" are the distances x = 1, 3,7. The masses have moments 1 and 9 and 14 (since
mx is 2 times 7). The total moment is 1 + 9 14 = 24. Then the balance point is at
2 = M,/M = 2416 = 4.
The total mass is the sum of the m's. The total moment is the sum of m, times x,
(negative on the other side of x = 0). If the masses are children on a seesaw, the
balance point is the center of gravity 2-also called the center of mass:

If all masses are moved to 2, the total moment (6 times 4) is still 24. The moment
equals the mass C m, times 2. The masses act like a single mass at 2.
Also: If we move the axis to 2, and leave the children where they are, the seesaw
balances. The masses on the left of 2 = 4 will offset the mass on the right. Reason:
The distances to the new axis are x, - 2. The moments add to zero by equation (1):
moment around new axis =

= 0.

Turn now to the continuous case, when mass is spread out along the line. Each
piece of length Ax has an average density p, = (mass of piece)/(length of piece) =
AmlAx. As the pieces get shorter, this approaches dmldx-the density at the point.
The limit of (small mass)/(small length) is the density p(x).
Integrating that derivative p = dmldx, we recover the total mass: C p,Ax becomes
total mass M = j p(x) dx.

(2)

When the mass is spread evenly, p is constant. Then M = pL = density times length.

8.5 Masses and Moments

The moment formula is similar. For each piece, the moment is mass p,Ax
multiplied by distance x-and we add. In the continuous limit, p(x) dx is multiplied
by x and we integrate:

I

total moment around y axis = My = xp(x) dx.

(3)

Moment is mass times distance. Dividing by the total mass M gives "average
distance":
moment - My - 5 xp(x) dx

Remark If you studied Section 8.4 on probability, you will notice how the formulas
match up. The mass p(x) dx is like the total probability p(x) dx. The moment
x )is the
xp(x) dx is like the mean xp(x) dx. The moment of inertia (x - ~ ) ~ p (dx
variance. Mathematics keeps hammering away at the same basic ideas! The only
difference is that the total probability is always 1. The mean really corresponds to
the center of mass 2, but in probability we didn't notice the division by p(x) dx = 1.

MASSES AND MOMENTS IN TWO DIMENSIONS

Instead of placing masses along the x axis, suppose m, is at the point (x,, y,) in the
plane. Similarly m, is at (x,, y,). Now there are two moments to consider. Around the
y axis M,, = C mnxnand around the x axis M, = C m, yn. Please notice that the x's go
into the moment My-because the x coordinate gives the distance from the y axis!
Around the x axis, the distance is y and the moment is M,. The center of mass is
the point (2, j) at which everything balances:

In the continuous case these sums become two-dimensional integrals. The total
mass is JJ p(x, y) dx dy, when the density is p = mass per unit area. These "double
integrals" are for the future (Section 14.1).Here we consider the most important case:
p = constant. Think of a thin plate, made of material with constant density (say
p = 1). To compute its mass and moments, the plate is cut into strips (Figure 8.14):
mass M = area of plate
moment My = J (distance x) (length of vertical strip) dx
moment M,

=

5 (height y) (length of horizontal strip) dy.

(6)
(7)

(8)

Applications of the Integral

Fig. 8.14 Plates cut into strips to compute masses and moments and centroids.

The mass equals the area because p = 1. For moments, all points in a vertical strip
are the same distance from the y axis. That distance is x. The moment is x times area,
or x times length times dx-and the integral accounts for all strips.
Similarly the x-moment of a horizontal strip is y times strip length times dy.
EXAMPLE 3 A plate has sides x = 0 and y = 0 and y = 4 - 2x. Find M, My, M,.

mass M = area =

1; y dx = 5;

(4 - 2x) dx = [4x - x2];

The "center of mass" has 2 = M,/M = 213 and j = M,/M = 413. This is the centroid
of the triangle (and also the "center of gravity"). With p = 1 these terms all refer to
the same balance point (2,J). The plate will not tip over, if it rests on that point.
EXAMPLE 4

Find My and M, for the half-circle below x2 + y2 = r2.

My= 0 because the region is symmetric-Figure 8.14 balances on the y axis. In the
x-moment we integrate y times the length of a horizontal strip (notice the factor 2):

Divide by the mass (the area :nr2) to find the height of the centroid: j = M,/M =
4r/3n. This is less than f r because the bottom of the semicircle is wider than the top.
MOMENT OF INERTIA

The moment of inertia comes from multiplying each mass by the square of its
distance from the axis. Around the y axis, the distance is x. Around the origin, it is r:
I y = E x i m n and I,=Eyim,,

and Io=Er;mn.

Notice that I, + I, = I, because xi + yi = r:. In the continuous case we integrate.
The moment of inertia around the y axis is I, = Jj x2p(x, y) dx dy. With a constant
density p = 1, we again keep together the points on a strip. On a vertical strip they
share the same x. On a horizontal strip they share y:

1

I, = (x2)(vertical strip length) dx and

I, = j (y2)(horizontal strip length) dy.

8.5 Masses and Moments

In engineering and physics, it is rotation that leads to the moment of inertia. Look
at the energy of a mass m going around a circle of radius r. It has I, = mr2.
kinetic energy = f mv2 = + m ( r ~=) f~I, w2.

(9)

The angular velocity is w (radians per second). The speed is v = rw (meters per second).
An ice skater reduces I, by putting her arms up instead of out. She stays close to
the axis of rotation (r is small). Since her rotational energy i I o w 2 does not change,
w increases as I, decreases. Then she spins faster.
Another example: It takes force to turn a revolving door. More correctly, it takes
torque. The force is multiplied by distance from the turning axis: T = Fx, so a push
further out is more effective.
To see the physics, replace Newton's law F = ma = m dv/dt by its rotational form:
T = I dwldt. Where F makes the mass move, the torque T makes it turn. Where m
measures unwillingness to change speed, I measures unwillingness to change rotation.
EXAMPLE 5 Find the moment of inertia of a rod about (a) its end and (b) its center.

The distance x from the end of the rod goes from 0 to L. The distance from the center
goes from - L/2 to L/2. Around the center, turning is easier because I is smaller:

constant. Energy loss from rolling friction is very small. If the mass is m and the
vertical drop is h, the energy at the top (all potential) is mgh. The energy at the bottom
(all kinetic) has two parts: $mv2 from movement along the plane plus +la2from
turning. Important fact: v = wr for a rolling cylinder or ball of radius r.

8 Applications of the Integral

Equate energies and set c;o = vlr:

The ratio I/mr2 is critical. Call it J and solve (11 ) for v2:

2gh (smaller J means larger velocity).
v2 = l+J
The order of J's, for different shapes and sizes, should decide the race. Apparently
the density doesn't matter, because it is a factor in both I and m-so it cancels in
J = I/mr2. A hollow cylinder has J = 1, which is the largest possible-all its mass is
at the full distance r from the axis. So the hollow cylinder should theoretically come
in last. This experiment was developed by Daniel Drucker.
Problems 35-37 find the other three J's. Problem 40 finds the time T by integration.
Your experiment will show how close this comes to the measured time.

8 Applications of the Integral

8.6 Force, Work, and Energy
Chapter 1 introduced derivatives df /dt and df / d x . The independent variable could be
t or x . For velocity it was natural to use the letter t . This section is about two
important physical quantities-force and work-for which x is the right choice.
The basic formula is W = F x . Work equalsforce times distance moved (distance in
the direction of F ). With a force of 100 pounds on a car that moves 20 feet, the work
is 2000 foot-pounds. If the car is rolling forward and you are pushing backward, the
work is -2000 foot-pounds. If your force is only 80 pounds and the car doesn't
move, the work is zero. In these examples the force is constant.
W = F x is completely parallel to f = vt. When v is constant, we only need multiplication. It is a changing velocity that requires calculus. The integral f v(t) dt adds
up small multiplications over short times. For a changing force, we add up small
pieces of work F d x over short distances:

W = Fx (constantforce)

W = J F(x) dx (changingforce).

In the first case we lift a suitcase weighing F = 30 pounds up x = 20 feet of stairs.
The work is W = 600 foot-pounds. The suitcase doesn't get heavier as we go up-it
only seems that way. Actually it gets lighter (we study gravity below).
In the second case we stretch a spring, which needs more force as x increases.
Hooke's law says that F(x) = kx. The force is proportional to the stretching distance x .
Starting from x = 0, the work increases with the square of x :

F=kx

and

w=J;kxdx=:kx2.

(1)

In metric units the force is measured in Newtons and the distance in meters. The unit
of work is a Newton-meter (a joule). The 600 foot-pounds for an American suitcase
would have been about 800 joules in France.
EXAMPLE 1 Suppose a force of F = 20 pounds stretches a spring 1 foot.
(a) Find k. The elastic constant is k = Flx = 20 pounds per foot.
(b) Find W. The work is i k x 2 = i 20 1' = 10 foot-pounds.
(c) Find x when F = - 10 pounds. This is compression not stretching: x = - foot.

Compressing the same spring through the same distance requires the same work. For
compression x and F are negative. But the work W = f kx2 is still positive. Please
note that W does not equal kx times x! That is the whole point of variable force
(change F x to F(x) dx).

5

May I add another important quantity from physics? It comes from looking at the
situation from the viewpoint of the spring. In its natural position, the spring rests
comfortably. It feels no strain and has no energy. Tension or compression gives it
potential energy. More stretching or more compression means more energy. The
change in energy equals the work. The potential energy of the suitcase increases by
600 foot-pounds, when it is lifted 20 feet.
Write V ( x ) for the potential energy. Here x is the height of the suitcase or the
extension of the spring. In moving from x = a to x = b, work = increase in potential:
This is absolutely beautiful. The work W is the definite integral. The potential V is
the indefinite integral. If we carry the suitcase up the stairs and back down, our total

8.6 Force, HEork, and Energy

work is zero. We may feel tired, but the trip down should have given back our energy.
(It was in the suitcase.) Starting with a spring that is compressed one foot, and ending
with the spring extended one foot, again we have done no work. V = f kx2 is the same
for x = - 1 and x = 1. But an extension from x = 1 to x = 3 requires work:
W = change in V = 3k(3)2- 3k(1)2.

Indefinite integrals like V come with a property that we know well. They include
an arbitrary constant C. The correct potential is not simply $kx2, it is i k x 2 + C. To
compute a change in potential, we don't need C. The constant cancels. But to determine V itself, we have to choose C. By fixing V = 0 at one point, the potential
is determined at all other points. A common choice is V= 0 at x = 0. Sometimes
V = 0 at x = oo (for gravity). Electric fields can be "grounded" at any point.
There is another connection between the potential V and the force F. According
to (2), V is the indefinite integral of F. Therefore F(x) is the derivative of V(x). The
fundamental theorem of calculus is also fundamental to physics:
force exerted on spring: F =

dV/dx

(34

force exerted by spring: F = - dV/dx

(3b)

Those lines say the same thing. One is our force pulling on the spring, the other is
the "restoring force" pulling back. (3a) and (3b) are a warning that the sign of F
depends on the point of view. Electrical engineers and physicists use the minus sign.
In mechanics the plus sign is more common. It is one of the ironies of fate that
F = V', while distance and velocity have those letters reversed: v =f '. Note the change
to capital letters and the change to x.

EXAMPLE 2

Newton's law of gravitation (inverse square law):

force to overcome gravity = GMm/x2

force exerted by gravity = - GMm/x2

An engine pushes a rocket forward. Gravity pulls it back. The gravitational constant
is G and the Earth's mass is M. The mass of the rocket or satellite or suitcase is m,
and the potential is the indefinite integral:
Usually C = 0, which makes the potential zero at x = co.
Remark When carrying the suitcase upstairs, x changed by 20 feet. The weight was
regarded as constant-which it nearly is. But an exact calculation of work uses the
integral of F(x), not just the multiplication 30 times 20. The serious difference comes
when the suitcase is carried to x = co. With constant force that requires infinite work.
With the correct (decreasing) force, the work equals V at infinity (which is zero) minus
V at the pickup point x, . The change in V is W = GMmlx, .

8 Applications of the Integral

KINETIC ENERGY

This optional paragraph carries the physics one step further. Suppose you release the
spring or drop the suitcase. The external force changes to F = 0. But the internal
force still acts on the spring, and gravity still acts on the suitcase. They both start
moving. The potential energy of the suitcase is converted to kinetic energy, until it
hits the bottom of the stairs.
Time enters the problem, either through Newton's law or Einstein's:
dv
(Newton) F = ma = m dt

(Einstein) F

= - (mu).

(5)

Here we stay with Newton, and pretend the mass is constant. Exercise 21 follows
goes to infinity
Einstein; the mass increases with velocity. There m = m,/
as v approaches c, the speed of light. That correction comes from the theory of
relativity, and is not needed for suitcases.
What happens as the suitcase falls? From x = a at the top of the stairs to x = b at
the bottom, potential energy is lost. But kinetic energy imv2 is gained, as we see from
integrating Newton's law:

So the work is also the change in V:

Since (6) = (7), the total energy +mu2+ V (kinetic plus potential) is constant:

This is the law of conservation of energy. The total energy is conserved.
EXAMPLE 3 Attach a mass m to the end of a stretched spring and let go. The spring's
energy V = i k x 2 is gradually converted to kinetic energy of the mass. At x = 0 the
change to kinetic energy is complete: the original i k x 2 has become ;mu2. Beyond
x = 0 the potential energy increases, the force reverses sign and pulls back, and kinetic
energy is lost. Eventually all energy is potential-when the mass reaches the other
extreme. It is simple harmonic motion, exactly as in Chapter 1 (where the mass was
the shadow of a circling ball). The equation of motion is the statement that the rate
of change of energy is zero (and we cancel v = dxldt):

That is F = ma in disguise. For a spring, the solution x = cos f i t will be found
in this book. For more complicated structures, engineers spend a billion dollars a
year computing the solution.

8.6 Force, Work, and Energy
PRESSURE AND HYDROSTATIC FORCE
Our forces have been concentrated at a single points. That is not the case for pressure.
A fluid exerts a force all over the base and sides of its container. Suppose a water
tank or swimming pool has constant depth h (in meters or feet). The water has weightdensity w %9800 N/m3 - 62 lb/ft3 . On the base, the pressure is w times h. The force
is wh times the base area A:
p = F/A = wh (lb/ft2 or N/m 2 ).

F = whA (pounds or Newtons)

(10)

Thus pressure is force per unit area. Here p and F are computed by multiplication,

because the depth h is constant. Pressure is proportional to depth (as divers know).
Down the side wall, h varies and we need calculus.
The pressure on the side is still wh-the same in all directions. We divide the side
into horizontal strips of thickness Ah. Geometry gives the length 1(h) at depth h
(Figure 8.17). The area of a strip is 1(h) Ah. The pressure wh is nearly constant on the
strip-the depth only changes by Ah. The force on the strip is AF = whlAh. Adding

those forces, and narrowing the strips so that Ah -+ 0, the total force approaches an
integral:
totalforce F= f whl(h) dh

EXAMPLE 4

Water tank and dam: length of side strip = 1,area of layer = A.

Find the total force on the trapezoidal dam in Figure 8.17.

The side length is 1= 60 when h = 0. The depth h increases from 0 to 20. The main

problem is to find I at an in-between depth h. With straight sides the relation is
linear: 1= 60 + ch. We choose c to give 1= 50 when h = 20. Then 50 = 60 + c(20)
yields c=- 1.
The total force is the integral of whl. So substitute 1= 60 - ½h:
F=

fo0 wh(60 -

-h) dh = [30wh2 - -wh3] o = 12000w - t(8000w).

With distance in feet and w = 62 lb/ft3 , F is in pounds. With distance in meters and

w = 9800 N/m3,the force is in Newtons.
Note that (weight-density w) = (mass-density p) times (g) = (1000)(9.8). These SI

units were chosen to make the density of water at O0C exactly p = 1000 kg/m 3 .
EXAMPLE 5

Find the work to pump water out of a tank. The area at depth h is A(h).

Imagine lifting out one layer of water at a time. The layer weighs wA(h) Ah. The

work to lift it to the top is its weight times the distance h, or whA(h) Ah. The work
to empty the whole tank is the integral:
W = f whA(h) dh.

(12)

8 Applications of the Integral

Suppose the tank is the bottom half of a sphere of radius R. The cross-sectional area
at depth h is A = n(R2 - h2). Then the work is the integral (12) from 0 to R. It equals
W = nwR4/4.
Units: w = for~e/(distance)~
times R~ = (distan~e)~
gives work W = (force)(distance).

Polar Coordinates and Complex
Numbers

Up to now, points have been located by their x and y coordinates. But if you were
a flight controller, and a plane appeared on the screen, you would not give its
position that way. Instead of x and y, you would read off the direction of the plane
and its distance. The direction is given by an angle 6. The distance is given by a
positive number r. Those are the polar coordinates of the point, where x and y are
the rectangular coordinates.
The angle 6 is measured from the horizontal. Suppose the distance is 2 and the
direction is 30"or 4 6 (degrees preferred by flight controllers, radians by mathematicians). A pilot looking along the x axis would give the plane's direction as "11
o'clock." This totally destroys our system of units, by measuring direction in hours.
But the angle and the distance locate the plane.
How far to a landing strip at r = 1 and 8 = - n/2? For that question polar coordinates are not good. They are perfect for distance from the origin (which equals r),
but for most other distances I would switch to x and y. It is extremely simple to
determine x and y from r and 8, and we will do it constantly. The most used formulas
in this chapter come from Figure 9.1-where the right triangle has angle 6 and
hypotenuse r. The sides of that triangle are x and y:
x = r cos 8

and

y = r sin 8.

(1)

The point at r = 2, 8 = 4 6 has x = 2 cos(n/6) and y = 2 sin(n/6). The cosine of
n/6 is J 5 / 2 and the sine is f. So x = $ and y = 1. Polar coordinates convert
easily to xy coordinates-now we go the other way.
Always x2 + y2 = r2. In this example (&)2 +
= (2)2. Pythagoras produces
r from x and y. The direction 8 is also available, but the formula is not so beautiful:
r = J w
Our point has y/x = I/&.

One angle with this tangent is 8 = tan-' ( 1 1 8 ) = n/6.

9.1 Polar Coordinates

Fig. 9.1 Polar coordinates r, 8 and rectangular coordinates x = r cos 9, y = r sin 8.

EXAMPLE 1 Point B in Figure 9.lc is at a negative angle 8 = -4 4 . The x coordinate
r COS(-n/4) is the same as r cos 4 4 (the cosine is even). But the y coordinate
r sin(-n/4) is negative. Computing r and 8 from x = 1 and y = 1, the distance is
r=
and tan 8 is -111.

,/m

Warning To any angle 8 we can add or subtract 2n-which goes a full 360" circle
and keeps the same direction. Thus - n/4 or - 45" is the same angle as 7n/4 or 315".
So is 15n/4 or 675".
If we add or subtract 180°, the tangent doesn't change. The point (1, - 1) is on the
-45" line at r =
The point (- 1, 1) is on the 135" line also with r =
Both
have tan 8 = - 1. We had to write "almost" in equation (2),because a point has many
8's and two points have the same r and tan 8.
Even worse, we could say that B = (1, -1) is on the 135" line but at a negative
distance r = A negative r carries the point backward along the 135" line, which
is forward to B. In giving the position of B, I would always keep r > 0. But in drawing
the graph of a polar equation, r < 0 is allowed. We move now to those graphs.

THE CIRCLE r = cos 8

The basis for Chapters 1-8 was y =f ( x ) . The key to this chapter is r = F(8). That is
a relation between the polar coordinates, and the points satisfying an equation like
r = cos 8 produce a polar graph.
It is not obvious why r = cos 8 gives a circle. The equations r = cos 28 and
r = cos28 and r = 1 + cos 8 produce entirely different graphs-not circles. The direct
approach is to take 8 = 0°, 30°, 60°, ... and go out the distance r = cos 8 on each ray.
The points are marked in Figure 9.2a, and connected into a curve. It seems to be a
circle of radius i, with its center at the point (i,0). We have to be able to show
mathematically that r = cos 8 represents a shifted circle.
One point must be mentioned. The angles from 0 to n give the whole circle. The
number r = cos 8 becomes negative after 7~12,and we go backwards along each ray.

Fig. 9.2 The circle r = cos 9 and the switch to x and y. The circle r = sin 8.

9 Polar Coordinates and Complex Numbers

At 8 = .n (to the left of the origin) the cosine is - 1. Going backwards brings us to
the same point as 8 = 0 and r = + 1-which completes the circle.
When 8 continues from 7c to 2.n we go around again. The polar equation gives the
circle twice. (Or more times, when 8 continues past 2.n.) If you don't like negative r's
and multiple circles, restrict 8 to the range from - 7112 to 7~12.We still have to see
why the graph of r = cos 8 is a circle.
Method 1 Multiply by r and convert to rectangular coordinates x and y:

(3)
r = cos 8 * r2 = r cos 8 * x2 + y2 = x.
This is a circle because of x2 + y2. From rewriting as (x - f)2 + y2 = (f)2 we recognize
its center and radius. Center at x = 4 and y = 0; radius f . Done.
Method 2 Write x and y separately as functions of 8. Then 8 is a "parameter":

x = r cos 8 = cos28

and

y = r sin 8 = sin 8 cos 8.

(4)

These are not polar equations but parametric equations. The parameter 0 is the angle,
but it could be the time-the curve would be the same. Chapter 12 studies parametric
equations in detail-here we stay with the circle.
To find the circle, square x and y and add. This produces x2 + y2 = x in Problem 26.
But here we do something new: Start with the circle andfind equation (4).In case you
don't reach Chapter 12, the idea is this. Add the vectors OC to the center and C P
out the radius:
The point P in Figure 9.2 has (x, y) = OC + C P = (f,0) + (f cos t, f sin t).
The parameter t is the angle at the center of the circle. The equations are
x = f + f cos t and y = sin t. A trigonometric person sees a double angle and sets
t = 28. The result is equation (4) for the circle:
x = f + f cos 28 = cos28

and

y = f sin 28 = sin 8 cos 8.

(5)

This step rediscovers a basic theorem of geometry: The angle t at the center is twice
the angle 0 at the circumference. End of quick introduction to parameters.
A second circle is r = sin 0, drawn in Figure 9.2~.A third circle is r = cos 8 + sin 8,
not drawn. Problem 27 asks you to find its xy equation and its radius. All calculations
go back to x = r cos 8 and y = r sin 8-the basic facts of polar coordinates! The last
exercise shows a parametric equation with beautiful graphs, because it may be possible to draw them now. Then the next section concentrates on r = F(8)-and goes
far beyond circles.

The most important equation in polar coordinates, by far, is r = 1. The angle 8 does
not even appear. The equation looks too easy, but that is the point! The graph is a
circle around the origin (the unit circle). Compare with the line x = 1. More important,

common in applications that they created the need for polar coordinates.

9 Polar Coordinates and Complex Numbers

This section studies polar curves r = F(8). The cardioid is a sentimental favoritemaybe parabolas are more practical. The cardioid is r = 1 + cos 8, the parabola is
r = 1/(1 + cos 8). Section 12.2 adds cycloids and astroids. A graphics package can
draw them and so can we.
Together with the circles r = constant go the straight lines 8 = constant. The equation 8 = n/4 is a ray out from the origin, at that fixed angle. If we allow r < 0, as we
do in drawing graphs, the one-directional ray changes to a full line. Important: The
circles are perpendicular to the rays. We have "orthogonal coordinates"-more interesting than the x - y grid of perpendicular lines. In principle x could be mixed with
8 (non-orthogonal), but in practice that never happens.
Other curves are attractive in polar coordinates-we look first at five examples.
Sometimes we switch back to x = r cos 8 and y = r sin 8, to recognize the graph.
EXAMPLE 1 The graph of r = l/cos 8 is the straight line x = 1 (because r cos 8 = 1).
EXAMPLE 2 The graph of r = cos 28 is the four-petalflower in Figure 9.3.

The points at 8 = 30" and - 30" and 150" and - 150" are marked on the flower. They
all have r = cos 28 = 9. There are three important symmetries-across the x axis,
across the y axis, and through the origin. This four-petal curve has them all. So does
the vertical flower r = sin 28-but surprisingly, the tests it passes are different.
(Across the x axis: y to - y) There are two ways to cross. First, change 8 to
The equation r = cos 28 stays the same. Second, change 8 to n - 8 and also r to
The equation r = sin 28 stays the same. Both flowers have x axis symmetry.

- 8.
- r.

(Across the y axis: x to - x) There are two ways to cross. First, change 8 to n - 8.
The equation r = cos 28 stays the same. Second, change 8 to - 8 and r to - r. Now
r = sin 28 stays the same (the sine is odd). Both curves have y axis symmetry.
(Through the origin) Now we change r to - r or 8 to 8 + n. The flower equations
pass the second test only: cos 2(8 + n ) = cos 28 and sin 2(8 + n) = sin 28. Every
equation r2 = F(8) passes the first test, since (- r)2 = r2.
The circle r = cos 8 has x axis symmetry, but not y or r. The spiral r = 8' has
y axis symmetry, because - r = (- Q3 is the same equation.
Question What happens if you change r to - r and also change 8 to 8 + n?
Answer Nothing-because (r, 8) and (- r, 8 + n) are always the same point.

Fig. 9.3 The four-petal flower r = cos 28 and the spiral r = 8 (r > 0 in red).

9.2

Polar Equations and Graphs

EXAMPLE 3 The graph of r = 8 is a spiral of Archimedes-or

maybe two spirals.

The spiral adds new points as 8 increases past 271. Our other examples are
"periodic"--8
= 271 gives the same point as 8 = 0. A periodic curve repeats itself. The
spiral moves out by 271 each time it comes around. If we allow negative angles and
negative r = 8, a second spiral appears.
EXAMPLE 4 The graph of r = 1

+ cos 8 is a cardioid. It is drawn in Figure 9 . 4 ~ .

The cardioid has no simple xy equation. Still the curve is very attractive. It has a
cusp at the origin and it is heart-shaped (hence its name). To draw it, plot r = 1 + cos 8
at 30" intervals and connect the points. For this curve r is never negative, since cos 8
never goes below - 1.
It is a curious fact that the electrical vector in your heart almost traces out a
cardioid. See Section 11.1 about electrocardiograms. If it is a perfect cardioid you are
in a little trouble.

Fig. 9.4 Lima~onsr = 1 + b cos 0, including a cardioid and Mars seen from Earth.

EXAMPLE 5 The graph of r = 1

+ b cos 8 is a limagon (a cardioid when b = 1).

Limaqon (soft c) is a French word for snail-not so well known as escargot but just
as inedible. (I am only referring to the shell. Excusez-moi!) Figure 9.4 shows how a
dimple appears as b increases. Then an inner loop appears beyond b = 1 (the cardioid
at b = 1 is giving birth to a loop). For large b the curve looks more like two circles.
The limiting case is a double circle, when the inner loop is the same as the outer
loop. Remember that r = cos 8 goes around the circle twice.
We could magnify the limaqon by a factor c, changing to r = c(l + b cos 8). We
could rotate 180" to r = 1 - b cos 8. But the real interest is whether these figures arise
in applications, and Donald Saari showed me a nice example.
Mars seen from Earth The Earth goes around the Sun and so does Mars. Roughly
speaking Mars is 14 times as far out, and completes its orbit in two Earth years.
We take the orbits as circles: r = 2 for Earth and r = 3 for Mars. Those equations
tell where but not when. With time as a parameter, the coordinates of Earth and Mars
are given at every instant t:

x, = 2 cos 2nt, yE = 2 sin 271t

and

x, = 3 cos nt, y, = 3 sin nt.

9 Polar Coordinates and Complex Numbers

At t = 1 year, the Earth completes a circle (angle = 2n) and Mars is halfway.
Now the key step. Subtract to find the position of Mars relative to Earth:
xM-,=3cosnt-2cos2nt

and

~~-~=3sinnt-2sin2~t.

Replacing cos 2nt by 2 cos2nt - 1 and sin 2nt by 2 sin nt cos nt, this is
x,

-,= (3 - 4 cos nt)cos nt + 2

and

-,= (3 - 4 cos nt)sin nt.

yM

Seen from the Earth, Mars does a loop in the sky! There are two t's for which
3 - 4 cos a t = 0 (or cos nt = 3). At both times, Mars is two units from Earth (x,-, =
2 and yM-, = 0). When we move the origin to that point, the 2 is subtracted awaythe M - E coordinates become x = r cos nt and y = r sin nt with r = 3 - 4 cos nt. That
is a limacon with a loop, like Figure 9.4d.

Note added in proof I didn't realize that a 3-to-2 ratio is also responsible for heating
up two spots on opposite sides of Mercury. From the newspaper of June 13, 1990:
"Astronomers today reported the first observations showing that Mercury
has two extremely hot spots. That is because Mercury, the planet closest to the
Sun, turns on its axis once every 59.6 days, which is a day on Mercury. It goes
around the sun every 88 days, a Mercurian year. With this 3-to-2 ratio between
spin and revolution, the Sun appears to stop in the sky and move backward,
describing a loop over each of the hot spots."
CONIC SECTIONS IN POLAR COORDINATES

The exercises include other polar curves, like lemniscates and 200-petal flowers. But
get serious. The most important curves are the ellipse and parabola and hyperbola.
In Section 3.5 their equations involved 1, x, y, x2, xy, y2. With one focus at the origin,
their polar equations are even better.
9A The graph of r = A/(1+ e cos 0) is a conic section with "eccentricity" e:

+

EXAMPLE 6 (e = 1) The graph of r = 1/(1 cos 8) is a parabola. This equation is
r + r cos 8 = 1 or r = 1 - x. Squaring both sides gives x2 y2 = 1 - 2x x2. Canceling x2 leaves Y2 = 1 - 2x, the parabola in Figure 9.5b.

+

+

The amplifying factor A blows up all curves, with no change in shape.
EXAMPLE 7 (e = 2) The same steps lead from r(1 + 2 cos 8) = 1 to r = 1 - 2x. Squaring gives x2 y2 = 1 - 4x + 4x2 and the x2 terms do not cancel. Instead we have
y2 - 3x2 = 1 - 4x. This is the hyperbola in Figure 9Sc, with a focus at (0,O).

+

The hyperbola y2 - 3x2 = 1 (without the - 4x) has its center at (0,O).
EXAMPLE 8 (e = 4) The same steps lead from r(1 + 4 cos 8) = 1 to r = 1 - 4x. Squaring gives the ellipse x2 + y2 = 1 - x ax2. Polar equations look at conics in a new
way, which happens to match the sun and planets perfectly. The sun at (0,O) is not
the center of the system, but a focus.

+

Finally e = 0 gives the circle r = 1. Center of circle = both foci = (0,O).

9.2 Polar Equations and Graphs

Fig. 9.5 r = 1/(1+ e cos 8) is an ellipse for e = 3, a parabola for e = 1, a hyperbola for e = 2.

The divectrix The figure shows the line d (the "directrix") for each curve. All points
P on the curve satisfy r = JPFI= eJPdl.The distance to the focus is e times the distance
to the directrix. (eis still the eccentricity, nothing to do with exponentials.) A geometer
would start from this property r = elPdl and construct the curve. We derive the
property from the equation:

The directrix is the line at x

= Ale.

That last equation is exactly lPFl = elPdl.

Notice how two numbers determine these curves. Here the numbers are A and e.
In Section 3.5 they were a and b. (The ellipse was x2/a2+ y2/b2= 1.) Using A and e
we go smoothly from ellipses through parabolas (at e = 1) and on to hyperbolas.
With three more numbers we can move the focus to any point and rotate the curve
through any angle. Conics are determined by five numbers.

9.3 Slope, Length, and Area for Polar Curves
The previous sections introduced polar coordinates and polar equations and polar
graphs. There was no calculus! We now tackle the problems of area (integral calculus)
and slope (differential calculus), when the equation is r = F(8). The use of F instead
off is a reminder that the slope is not dFld8 and the area is not F(8)dB.
Start with area. The region is always divided into small pieces-what is their
shape? Look between the angles 8 and 8 + A8 in Figure 9.6a. Inside the curve is a
narrow wedge-almost a triangle, with A8 as its small angle. If the radius is constant

SLOPE OF A POLAR CURVE

Where is the highest point on the cardioid r = 1 + cos 8? What is the slope at 8 =
4 4 ? Those are not the most important questions in calculus, but still we should
know how to answer them. I will describe the method quickly, by switching to
rectangular coordinates:
x = r cos 9 = (1 + cos 9)cos 8

y = r sin 9 = (1 + cos @sin 8.

and

For the highest point, maximize y by setting its derivative to zero:

+

dyld8 = (1 + cos O)(cos 8) (- sin @(sin 8) = 0.

(3)

+

Thus cos 8 + cos 29 = 0, which happens at 60". The height is y = (1 *)(,/5/2).
For the slope, use the chain rule dyld0 = (dy/dx)(dx/dO):
dy - dy/d8 - (1 + cos 8)(cos 8) + (-sin 8)(sin 8)
---dx

dx/d8

(1 + cos 8)(- sin 8) + (- sin 8) cos 8'

(4)

Equations (3) and (4) avoid the awkward (or impossible) step of eliminating 8. Instead
of trying to find y as a function of x, we keep x and y as functions of 8. At 8 = n/4,
the ratio in equation (4) yields dyldx = - 141 +
Problem 18 finds a general formula for the slope, using dyldx = (dy/dO)/(dx/dO).
Problem 20 finds a more elegant formula, by looking at the question differently.

LENGTH OF A POLAR CURVE

The length integral always starts with ds = J ( ~ x )+~(dy)2. A polar curve has x =
r cos 8 = F(8) cos 8 and y = F(9) sin 8. Now take derivatives by the product rule:
dx = (F'(9)cos 8 - F(8)sin 9)dO

and

dy = (F'(8)sin 8 + F(8)cos 8)dO.

9.4 Complex Numbers
Real numbers are sufficient for most of calculus. Starting from x 2 + 4, its integral
3x3 + 4x + C is also real. If we are given x3 - 1, its derivative 3x2 is real. But the
roots (or zeros) of those polynomials are complex numbers:

x2 + 4 = 0 and .u3 - 1 = 0 have complex solutions.
We expect two square roots of - 4. There are three cube roots of 1. Complex numbers
are unavoidable, in order to find n roots for each polynomial of degree n.
This section explains how to work with complex numbers. You will see their
relation to polar coordinates. At the end, we use them to solve differential equations.
Start with the imaginary number i. Everybody knows that x2 = - 1 has no real
solution. When you square a real number, the result is never negative. So the world
has agreed on a solution called i. (Except that electrical engineers call it j.) Imaginary
numbers follow the normal rules of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,
with one difference: Whenever i 2 appears it is replaced by - 1 . In particular - i times
- i gives + i 2 = - 1. In other words, - i is also a square root of - 1 . There are two
solutions (i and - i ) to the equation x 2 + 1 = 0.
Finding cube roots of 1 will stretch us further. We need complex numbers-real
plus imaginary.

+

9B A complex number (say 1 3i) is the sum of a real number (1) and a pure
imaginary number (39. Addition keeps those parts separate; multiplication uses
i2 = - 1:

Addition:
Multiplication:

+ 3i) = 1 + 1 + i(3 + 3) = 2 + 6i

9.4 Complex Numbers

+

Adding 1 3i to 5 - i is easy (6 2i). Multiplying is longer, but you see the rules:
The point is this: We don't have to imagine any more new numbers. After accepting
i, the rest is straightforward. A real number is just a complex number with no
imaginary part! When 1 3i combines with its "complex conjugate" 1 - 3i-adding
or multiplying-the answer is real:

+

(1 + 3i) + (1 - 3i) = 2 (real)

(1)

(1 + 3i)(l - 3i) = 1 - 3i+ 3i- 9i2 = 10. (real)

The complex conjugate offers a way to do division, by making the denominator real:
1 - 1 1-3i - 1-3i

THE COMPLEX PLANE

+

Complex numbers correspond to points in a plane. The number 1 3i corresponds to
the point (1, 3). Similarly x iy is paired with (x, y)-which is x units along the "real
axis" and y units up the "imaginary axis." The ordinary plane turns into the complex
plane. The absolute value r is the same as the polar coordinate r (Figure 9.8~).
The figure shows two more copies of the complex plane. The one in the middle is
for addition and subtraction. It uses rectangular coordinates. The one on the right is
for multiplication and division and squaring. It uses polar coordinates. In squaring
a complex number, r is squared and 8 is doubled-as the right figure and equation
(3) both show.

Fig. 9.8 The complex plane shows x, y, r, 8. Add with x and y, multiply with r and 8.

Adding complex numbers is like adding vectors (Chapter 11). The real parts give
3 - 1 and the imaginary parts give 1 + 1. The vector sum (2,2) corresponds to the
complex sum 2 2i. The complex conjugate 3 - i is the mirror image across the real
axis (i reversed to -i). The connection to r and 8 is the same as before (you see it in
the triangle):

+

x = r cos 8 and y = r sin 8 so that x + iy = r(cos 8 + i sin 8).

In the third figure, 1 + i has r =
and 8 = n/4. The polar form is
cos n/4 +
f i i sin n/4. When this number is squared, its 45" angle becomes 90". The square is
(1 + i)2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i. Its polar form is 2 cos 7c/2 + 2i sin n/2.

For nth powers we reach $ and no. For square roots, r goes to
and 8 goes to
48. The number -1 is at 180°, so its square root i is at 90".
To see why.0 is doubled in equation (3), factor out r2 and multiply as usual:
(cos 0 + i sin 8)(cos 8 + i sin 8) = cos28- sin28+ 2i sin 8 cos 8.
The right side is cos 28 + i sin 20. The double-angle formulas from trigonometry
match the squaring of complex numbers. The cube would be cos 38 + i sin 38 (because
20 and 0 add to 30, and r is still 1). The nth power is in de Moivre's formula:
(cos 8 + i sin 8)"= cos n8 + i sin no.

(4)

With n = - 1 we get cos(- 8) + i sin(- @-which is cos 8 - i sin 8, the complex
conjugate:
1
1
cos 8 - i sin 0 - cos 8 - i sin 8
(5)

cos 0 + i sin 8 cos 8 + i sin 8 cos 8 - i sin 8
We are almost touching Euler's formula, the key to all numbers on the unit circle:
Euler's formula:

cos 8 + i sin 8 = eie.

(6)

Squaring both sides gives (ei3(eie)= e"'. That is equation (3).The - 1 power is l/eie=
e-". That is equation (5). Multiplying any eieby ei4produces ei(e+". The special case
4 = 0 gives the square, and the special case C#I = - 8 gives eiBe-" = 1.
Euler's formula appeared in Section 6.7, by changing x to i8 in the series for ex:

O2
O3
becomes eie=l+i8---i-+.-•

A highlight of Chapter 10 is to recognize two new series on the right. The real terms
1 - #I2 + ..- add up to cos 8. The imaginary part 8 - &03+ + . * adds up to sin 8.
Therefore eie equals cos 8 + i sin 0. It is fantastic that the most important periodic
functions in all of mathematics come together in this graceful way.
We learn from Euler (pronounced oiler) that e2"' = 1. The cosine of 2n is 1, the sine
is zero. If you substitute x = 2ni into the infinite series, somehow everything cancels
except the 1-this is almost a miracle. From the viewpoint of angles, 8 = 2n carries
us around a full circle and back to e2"' = 1.
Multiplying Euler's formula by r, we have a third way to write a complex number:
Every complex number is

x + iy = r cos 8 + ir sin 8 = reie.

EXAMPLE 3 ( x 2 4 = 0 ) The square roots of - 4 are 2i and - 2i. Instead of (i)(i)=
- 1 we have (2i)(2i)= - 4. If Euler insists, we write 2i and - 2i as 2einl2and 2ei3"I2.
EXAMPLE 4 (The cube roots of 1 ) In rectangular coordinates we have to solve
( x + iy)" 1, which is not easy. In polar coordinates this same equation is r3e3"= 1.
Immediately r = 1. The angle 8 can be 27113 or 47113 or 67113-the cube roots in the
figure are evenly spaced

You see why the angle 87113 gives nothing new. It completes a full circle back to 27113.
The nth roots of 1 are e2"'ln, e4"'/", ... , 1 . There are n of them.
They lie at angles 2 4 n , 4i~/n,. .. ,2;n around the unit circle.
SOLUTION OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

The algebra of complex numbers is now applied to the calculus of complex functions.
The complex number is c, the complex function is ec'. It will solve the equations
y" = - 4y and y"' = y, by connecting them to c2 = - 4 and c3 = 1. Chapter 16 does
the same for all linear differential equations with constant coefficients-this is an
optional preview.
Please memorize the one key idea: Substitute y = ect into the dzyerential equation
and solve for c. Each derivative brings a factor c, so y' = cect and y" = c2ec':

d2y/dt2=

-

4y leads to c2ect=

- 4ect,

which gives c2 =

-

4.

(8)
For this differential equation, c must be a square root of - 4. We know the candidates
(c = 2i and c = - 2i). The equation has two "pure exponential solutions" ec':
Y = e2it
and
y = e-2i'.
(9)
Their combinations y = ~ e +~~ e" - give
~ " all solutions. In Chapter 16 we will choose
the two numbers A and B to match two initial conditions at t = 0.
The solution y = e2" = cos 2t + i sin 2t is complex. The differential equation is real.
For real y's, take the real and imaginary parts of the complex solutions:

yreal= cos 2t and yimaginary
= sin 2t.

(10)

These are the "pure oscillatory solutions." When y = e2" travels around the unit
circle, its imaginary part sin 2t moves up and down. (It is like the ball and its shadow
in Section 1.4, but twice as fast because of 2t.) The real part cos 2t goes backward
and forward. By the chain rule, the second derivative of cos 2t is -4 cos 2t. Thus
d yldt = - 4y and we have real solutions.

9 Polar Coordinates and Complex Numbers

EXAMPLE 5

Find three solutions and then three real solutions to d3y/dt3= y.

Key step: Substitute y = ect. The result is c3ect= ect. Thus c3 = 1 and c is a cube root
of 1. The candidate c = 1 gives y = et (our first solution). The next c is complex:

The real part of the exponent leads to the absolute value lyl= e-'I2. It decreases as t
gets larger, so y moves toward zero. At the same time, the factor eiAtI2 goes around
the unit circle. Therefore y spirals in to zero (Figure 9.10). So does its complex
conjugate, which is the third exponential. Changing i to - i in (11) gives the third
cube root of 1 and the third solution e-'I2eThe first real solution is y = et. The others are the two parts of the spiral:

That is r cos 0 and r sin 0. It is the ultimate use (until Chapter 16) of polar coordinates
and complex numbers. We might have discovered cos 2t and sin 2t without help, for
y" = - 4y. I don't think these solutions to y"' = y would have been found.
EXAMPLE 6

Find four solutions to d4y/dt4 = y by substituting y

= ect.

Four derivatives lead to c4 = 1. Therefore c is i or - 1 or - i or 1. The solutions are
y = eit, e - l , e-", and et. If we want real solutions, eit and e-" combine into cos t and
sin t . In all cases y"" = y.

Infinite Series

Infinite series can be a pleasure (sometimes). They throw a beautiful light on sin x
and cos x. They give famous numbers like n and e. Usually they produce totally
unknown functions-which might be good. But on the painful side is the fact that
an infinite series has infinitely many terms.
It is not easy to know the sum of those terms. More than that, it is not certain
that there is a sum. We need tests, to decide if the series converges. We also need
ideas, to discover what the series converges to. Here are examples of convergence,
divergence, and oscillation:

The first series converges. Its next term is 118, after that is 1116-and every step
brings us halfway to 2. The second series (the sum of 1's) obviously diverges to infinity.
The oscillating example (with 1's and - 1's) also fails to converge.
All those and more are special cases of one infinite series which is absolutely the
most important of all:
1
The geometric series is 1 + x x2 + x3 + = 1-x'

+

This is a series of functions. It is a "power series." When we substitute numbers for
x, the series on the left may converge to the sum on the right. We need to know when

it doesn't. Choose x = 4 and x = 1 and x = - 1:

1+ 1+ 1

+

1 + (- 1)+ (-

1 -1
is divergent. Its sum is ---a
1-1
0

is the oscillating series. Its sum should be --1-(-1
2'

The last sum bounces between one and zero, so at least its average is 3. At x = 2
there is no way that 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + agrees with 1/(1 - 2).
This behavior is typical of a power series-to converge in an interval of x's and
- a -

10.1 The Geometric Series

to diverge when x is large. The geometric series is safe for x between -1 and 1.
Outside that range it diverges.
The next example shows a repeating decimal 1.1 1 1.. .:

Set x = - The geometric series is 1 + - +
10'
10
The decimal 1.1 11 ... is also the fraction 1/(1 - &), which is 1019. Every
fvaction leads to a repeating decimal. Every repeating decimal adds up (through the
geometric series) to a fraction.
To get 3.333 ..., just multiply by 3. This is 1013. To get 1.0101 ..., set x = 1/100.
This is the fraction 1/(1- &), which is 100/99.
Here is an unusual decimal (which eventually repeats). I don't really understand it:
-I -.004 115226337448

...

Most numbers are not fractions (or repeating decimals). A good example is a:

This is 3.1415.. .,a series that certainly converges. We happen to know the first billion
terms (the billionth is given below). Nobody knows the 2 billionth term. Compare
that series with this one, which also equals a:

That alternating series is really remarkable. It is typical of this chapter, because its
pattern is clear. We know the 2 billionth term (it has a minus sign). This is not a
geometric series, but in Section 10.1 it comes from a geometric series.
Question Does this series actually converge? What if all signs are + ?
Answer The alternating series converges to a (Section 10.3). The positive series
diverges to infinity (Section 10.2). The terms go to zero, but their sum is infinite.

This example begins to show what the chapter is about. Part of the subject deals
with special series, adding to 1019 or n: or ex. The other part is about series in general,
adding to numbers or functions that nobody has heard of. The situation was the
same for integrals-they give famous answers like In x or unknown answers like
1xXdx. The sum of 1 + 118 + 1/27 + is also unknown-although a lot of mathematicians have tried.
The chapter is not long, but it is full. The last half studies power series. We begin
with a linear approximation like 1 + x. Next is a quadratic approximation like
1 + x + x2. In the end we match all the derivatives of f(x). This is the "Taylor series,"
a new way to create functions-not by formulas or integrals but by infinite series.
No example can be better than 1/(1 - x), which dominates Section 10.1. Then we
define convergence and test for it. (Most tests are really comparisons with a geometric
series.) The second most important series in mathematics is the exponential series
eX = 1 + x + $x2 + &x3+ ---.It includes the series for sin x and cos x, because of the
formula eix = cos x + i sin x. Finally a whole range of new and old functions will
come from Taylor series.
In the end, all the key functions of calculus appear as ''infinite polynomials" (except
the step function). This is the ultimate voyage from the linear function y = mx + b.

10.1 The Geometric Series 1 -

We begin by looking at both sides of the geometric series:

How does the series on the left produce the function on the right? How does 1/(1 - x)
produce the series? Add up two terms of the series, then three terms, then n terms:

For the first, 1 + x times 1 - x equals 1 - x 2 by ordinary algebra. The second begins
to make the point: 1 + x + x 2 times 1 - x gives 1 - x x - x 2 + x 2 - x3. Between
1 at the start and - x 3 at the end, everything cancels. The same happens in all cases:
1 --. xn-' times 1 - x leaves 1 at the start and - xn at the end. This proves
equation (2)-the sum of n terms of the series.
For the whole series we will push n towards infinity. On a graph you can see what
is happening. Figure 10.1 shows n = 1 and n = 2 and n = 3 and n = a.

+

+ +

Fig. 10.1 Two terms, then three
terms, then full series:

The infinite sum gives a jfnite
answer, provided x is between
- 1 and 1. Then xn goes to zero:

Now start with the function 1/(1 - x). How does it produce the series? One way is
elementary but brutal, to do "long division" of 1 - x into 1 (next to the figure).
Another way is to look up the binomial formula for (1 - x)-l. That is cheating-we
want to discover the series, not just memorize it. The successful approach uses cal-

culus. Compute the derivatives o f f (x) = 1/(1 - x):
At x = 0 these derivatives are 1, 2, 6,24, .... Notice how
them positive. The nth derivative at x = 0 is n factorial:

-

1 from the chain rule keeps

Now comes the idea. To match the series with 1/(1- x), match all those derivatives at
x = 0. Each power xn gets one derivative right. Its derivatives at x = 0 are zero, except
the nth derivative, which is n! By adding all powers we get every derivative rightso the geometric series matches the function:

+ + x2+ x3+

1 x

has the same derivatives at x = 0 as 1/(1 - x).

The linear approximation is 1 + x. Then comes 3f "(0)x2= x2. The third derivative
is supposed to be 6, and x 3 is just what we need. Through its derivatives, the function
produces the series.
With that example, you have seen a part of this subject. The geometric series
diverges if 1x1 2 1. Otherwise it adds up to the function it comes from (when
- 1 < x < 1). To get familiar with other series, we now apply algebra or calculus- to
reach the square of 1/(1 - x) or its derivative or its integral. The point is that these
operations are applied to the series.
The best I know is to show you eight operations that produce something useful.
At the end we discover series for In 2 and n.

1. Multiply the geometric series by a or ax:

The first series fits the decimal 3.333 ... . In that case a = 3. The geometric series for
x = & gave 1.111 ... = 1019, and this series is just three times larger. Its sum is 1013.
The second series fits other decimals that are fractions in disguise. To get 12/99,
choose a = 12 and x = 1/100:

Problem 13 asks about ,8787 ... and .I23123 ... . It is usual in precalculus to write
a + ar + ar2 + = a/(l - r). But we use x instead of r to emphasize that this is a
function-which we can now differentiate.

+

2. The derivative of the geometric series 1 x + x

+ .-.is 1/(1

-

x)~:

At x = & the left side starts with 1.23456789. The right side is 1/(1 - &)2 = 1/(9/10)2,
which is 100181. If you have a calculator, divide 100 by 81.
The answer should also be near (1.1111111I ) ~which
,
is 1.2345678987654321.
3. Subtract 1 + x + x 2 +

from 1 + 2x + 3x2 +

as you subtract functions:

Curiously, the same series comes from multiplying (5) by x. It answers a question left
open in Section 8.4-the average number of coin tosses until the result is heads. This

10 Infinite Series

is the sum l(pl) + 2(p2)+ --.from probability, with x = f :

The probability of waiting until the nth toss is p,, = (4)". The expected value is two
tosses. I suggested experiments, but now this mean value is exact.
4 . Multiply series: the geometric series times itselfis 1/(1 - x) squared:

The series on the right is not new! In equation (5) it was the derivative of y = 1/(1- x).
Now it is the square of the same y. The geometric series satisfies dyldx = y2, so the
function does too. We have stumbled onto a differential equation.
Notice how the series was squared. A typical term in equation (8) is 3x2, coming
from 1 times x 2 and x times x and x 2 times 1 on the left side. It is a lot quicker to
square 1/(1 - x)-but other series can be multiplied when we don't know what functions they add up to.
5. Solve dyldx = y2fvom any starting value-a new application of series:

Suppose the starting value is y = 1 at x = 0. The equation y' = y 2 gives l2 for the
derivative. Now a key step: The derivative of the equation gives y" = 2yy'. At x = 0
that is 2 1 1. Continuing upwards, the derivative of 2yy1 is 2yy" + 2(y')2. At x = 0
that is y"' = 4 + 2 = 6.
All derivatives are factorials: 1,2,6,24, .... We are matching the derivatives of the
geometric series 1 + x + x2 + x3 + ... . Term by term, we rediscover the solution to
y' = Y2. The solution starting from y(0) = 1 is y = 1/(1- x).
= 1 as before. The chain rule gives
A different starting value is - 1. Then y' = (y" = 2yy' = - 2 and then y"' = 6. With alternating signs to match these derivatives, the
solution starting from - 1 is

It is a small challenge to recognize the function on the right from the series on the
left. The series has - x in place of x; then multiply by -1. The sum y = - 1/(1 + x)
also satisfies y' = y2. We can solve diferential equations from all starting values by
inJinite series. Essentially we substitute an unknown series into the equation, and
calculate one term at a time.
6 . The integrals of 1 + x

+ x2 + ..- and

1 - x + x2 - -.. are logarithms:

The derivative of (10a) brings back the geometric series. For logarithms we find l/n
not l/n! The first term x and second term i x 2 give linear and quadratic approximations. Now we have the whole series. I cannot fail to substitute 1 and 4, to find
ln(1 - 1) and ln(1 + 1) and ln(1 - )):

10.1 The Geometric Series

+4 +4

The first series diverges to infinity. This harmonic series 1
+ came into the
earliest discussion of limits (Section 2.6). The second series has alternating signs and
converges to In 2. The third has plus signs and also converges to In 2. These will be
examples for a major topic in infinite series-tests for convergence.
For the first time in this book we are able to compute a logarithm! Something
remarkable is involved. The sums of numbers in (11) and (12) were discoveredfrom the
sums offunctions in (10). You might think it would be easier to deal only with numbers,
to compute In 2. But then we would never have integrated the series for 1/(1 - x) and
detected (10). It is better to work with x, and substitute special values like at the
end.
There are two practical problems with these series. For In 2 they converge slowly.
For In e they blow up. The correct answer is In e = 1, but the series can't find it. Both
problems are solved by adding (10a) to (lob), which cancels the even powers:

4

At x = f, the right side is in 4 - In 4 = In 2. Powers off-are much smaller than powers
of 1 or f, so in 2 is quickly computed. All logarithms can be found from the improved
series (13).

7 . Change variables in the geometric series (replace x by x 2 or - x2):

This produces new functions (always our goal). They involve even powers of x. The
second series will soon be used to calculate n. Other changes are valuable:

Equation (17) is a series of negative powers x-". It converges when 1x1 is greater than
1. Convergence in (17) is for large x. Convergence in (16) is for 1x1 < 2.
8. The integralof 1 - x 2 + x 4 - x 6 + -..yields the inverse tangent of x:

We integrated (15) and got odd powers. The magical formula for n (discovered by
Leibniz) comes when x = 1. The angle with tangent 1 is n/4:

The first three terms give n z 3.47 (not very close). The 5000th term is still of size
.0001, so the fourth decimal is still not settled. By changing to x = l / d , the astronomer Halley and his assistant found 71 correct digits of n/6 (while waiting for the
comet). That is one step in the long and amazing story of calculating n. The Chudnovsky brothers recently took the latest step with a supercomputer-they have found
more than one billion decimal places of n (see Science, June 1989). The digits look
completely random, as everyone expected. But so far we have no proof that all ten
digits occur & of the time.

10 Infinite Series

Historical note Archimedes located n above 3.14 and below 3+. Variations of his
method (polygons in circles) reached as far as 34 digits-but not for 1800 years. Then
Halley found 71 digits of 7116 with equation (18). For faster convergence that series
was replaced by other inverse tangents, using smaller values of x:

A prodigy named Dase, who could multiply 100-digit numbers in his head in 8 hours,
finally passed 200 digits of n. The climax of hand calculation came when Shanks
published 607 digits. I am sorry to say that only 527 were correct. (With years of
calculation he went on to 707 digits, but still only 527 were correct.) The mistake was
not noticed until 1945! Then Ferguson reached 808 digits with a desk calculator.
Now comes the computer. Three days on an ENIAC (1949) gave 2000 digits. A
hundred minutes on an IBM 704 (1958) gave 10,000 digits. Shanks (no relation)
reached 100,000 digits. Finally a million digits were found in a day in 1973, with a
CDC 7600. All these calculations used variations of equation (20).
The record after that went between Cray and Hitachi and now IBM. But the
method changed. The calculations rely on an incredibly accurate algorithm, based
on the "arithmetic-geometric mean iteration" of Gauss. It is also incredibly simple,
all things considered:

The number of correct digits more than doubles at every step. By n = 9 we are far
beyond Shanks (the hand calculator). No end is in sight. Almost anyone can go past
a billion digits, since with the Chudnovsky method we don't have to start over again.
It is time to stop. You may think (or hope) that nothing more could possibly be
done with geometric series. We have gone a long way from 1/(1 - x), but some
functions can never be reached. One is ex (and its relatives sin x, cos x, sinh x, cosh x).
Another is JG(and its relatives I/,/-,
sin- 'x, sec- 'x, . ..). The exponentials
are in 10.4, with series that converge for all x. The square-roots are in 10.5, closer to
geometric series and converging for 1x1 < 1. Before that we have to say what convergence means.
The series came fast, but I hope you see what can be done (subtract, multiply,
differentiate, integrate). Addition is easy, division is harder, all are legal. Some unexpected numbers are the sums of infinite series.
Added in proof By e-mail I just learned that the record for TC is back in Japan:
230 digits which is more than 1.07 billion. The elapsed time was 100 hours (75 hours
of CPU time on an NEC machine). The billionth digit after the decimal point is 9.

10.2 Convergence Tests: Positive Series
This is the third time we have stopped the calculations to deal with the definitions.
Chapter 2 said what a derivative is. Chapter 5 said what an integral is. Now we say
what the sum of a series is-if it exists. In all three cases a limit is involved. That is
the formal, careful, cautious part of mathematics, which decides if the active and
progressive parts make sense.
The series f + 4+
converges to 1. The series 1 + f + 4 + diverges to infinity. The series 1 4 - -..converges to In 2. When we speak about convergence or
divergence of a series, we are really speaking about convergence or divergence of its
"partial sums."

+

+

+ .-.stops at a,:
s, = sum of the f i s t n terms = a l + a2 + -.-+ a,.
Thus sn is part of the total sum. The example f + 4+ 4+ -.-has partial sums

DEFINITION 1 The partial sum s, of the series a, + a 2 + a,

Those add up larger and larger parts of the series-what is the sum of the whole
series? The answer is: The series f + 4+ ... converges to 1 because its partial sums s,
converge to 1. The series a, + a2 + a, + ... converges to s when its partial sumsgoing further and further out-approach this limit s. Add the a's, not the s's.
DEFINITION 2

The sum of a series is the limit of its partial sums s,.

We repeat: if the limit exists. The numbers s, may have no limit. When the partial
sums jump around, the whole series has no sum. Then the series does not converge.
When the partial sums approach s, the distant terms a, are approaching zero. More
than that, the sum of distant terms is approaching zero.
The new idea (2a, = s) has been converted to the old idea (s, + s).
EXAMPLE 1 The geometric series &

+ & + &+

converges to s = 4.

The partial sums sl , s,, s,, s, are .l, .11, . I l l , .1111. They are approaching s = 4.

10.2 Convergence Tests Positive Series

Note again the difference between the series of a's and the sequence of s's. The series
1 + 1 + 1 + ..-diverges because the sequence of s's is 1,2, 3, ... . A sharper example is
diverges because its partial sums 1, i f , ... eventuthe harmonic series: 1 i
ally go past every number s. We saw that in 2.6 and will see it again here.
Do not confuse a, -+ 0 with s, + s. You cannot be sure that a series converges, just
on the basis that a, + 0. The harmonic series is the best example: a, = l l n -+ 0 but
still s, -+ oo. This makes infinite series into a delicate game, which mathematicians
enjoy. The line between divergence and convergence is hard to find and easy to cross.
A slight push will speed up a, + 0 and make the s, converge. Even though a, + 0
does not by itself guarantee convergence, it is the first requirement:

+ + 4+

I 10A

If a series converges (s, 4 s) then its terms must approach zero (a, -+ 0).

I

Proof Suppose s, approaches s (as required by convergence). Then also s,-,
approaches s, and the difference s, - s, - approaches zero. That difference is a,. So

,

a,

0.

EXAMPLE 1 (continued) For the geometric series 1 + x + x2 +
the test an + 0 is
the same as xn -+ 0. The test is failed if 1x1 2 1, because the powers of x don't go to
zero. Automatically the series diverges. The test is passed if - 1 < x < 1. But to prove
convergence, we cannot rely on a, -+ 0. It is the partial sums that must converge:
.a-,

1
sn -+ -.
This is s.
1-x
1-x
For other series, first check that a, -,0 (otherwise there is no chance of convergence). The a, will not have the special form xn-so we need sharper tests.
The geometric series stays in our mind for this reason. Many convergence tests are
comparisons with that series. The right comparison gives enough information:

s, = 1 + x + .., + x"-'

1 - xn
=-

and

If la,/ < iand la2[< + and ..., then a, + a 2 + ... converges faster than f + $ + ....
More generally, the terms in a, + a2 + a3 + ... may be smaller than
ax + ax2 + ax3 + .. Provided x < 1, the second series converges. Then an also
converges. We move now to convergence by comparison or divergence by comparison.
Throughout the rest of this section, all numbers a, are assumed positive.
+.

COMPARISON TEST AND INTEGRAL TEST

In practice it is rare to compute the partial sums s, = a , + + a,. Usually a simple
formula can't be found. We may never know the exact limit s. But it is still possible
to decide convergence- whether there is a sum- by comparison with another series
that is known to converge.

1b, converges. Then

I

The smaller terms an add to a smaller sum: an is below bn and must converge.
On the other hand suppose an 2 cn and cn = co. This comparison forces 1
an = m.
A series diverges if it is above another divergent series.
Note that a series of positive terms can only diverge "to infinity." It cannot oscillate,
because each term moves it forward. Either the s, creep up on s, passing every number
below it, or they pass all numbers and diverge. If an increasing sequence s, is bounded
above, it must converge. The line of real numbers is complete, and has no holes.

10 Infinite Series

The harmonic series 1 + 3 + 4+

+ ... diverges to infinity.

A comparison series is 1 + 3 + $ + $ + $ + $ + $ + $ + .... The harmonic series is
larger. But this comparison series is really 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + ... , because i-= = $.
The comparison series diverges. The harmonic series, above it, must also diverge.

a

To apply the comparison test, we need something to compare with. In Example 2,
we thought of another series. It was convenient because of those 3's. But a different
series will need a different comparison, and where will it come from? There is an
automatic way to think of a comparison series. It comes from the integral test.
Allow me to apply the integral test to the same example. To understand the integral
test, look at the areas in Figure 10.2. The test compares rectangles with curved areas.
1
y (s)= -

y (x) =

1
sum + oo so

Fig. 10.2

Integral test: Sums and integrals both diverge (p = 1) and both converge (p > 1).

EXAMPLE 2 (again) Compare 1 +

3 + 4+ ... with the area under the curve y = 1/x.

Every term a, = lln is the area of a rectangle. We are comparing it with a curved
area c,. Both areas are between x = n and x = n + 1, and the rectangle is above the
curve. SO a, > c,:
1
rectangular area a, = - exceeds curved area c, =
n
Here is the point. Those c,'s look complicated, but we can add them up. The sum
c, + ... + c, is the whole area, from 1 to n + 1. It equals ln(n + 1)-we know the
integral of llx. We also know that the logarithm goes to infinity.
The rectangular area 1 + 112 + ... + lln is above the curved area. By comparison
of areas, the harmonic series diverges to infinity-a little faster than ln(n + 1).
Remark The integral of l/x has another advantage over the series with 3's. First,
the integral test was automatic. From l/n in the series, we went to l/x in the integral.
Second, the comparison is closer. Instead of adding only $ when the number of terms
is doubled, the true partial sums grow like In n. To prove that, put rectangles under
the curve.
Rectangles below the curve give an area below the integral. Figure 10.2b omits the
first rectangle, to get under the curve. Then we have the opposite to the first
comparison-the sum is now smaller than the integral:

Adding 1 to both sides, s, is below 1 + In n. From the previous test, s, is above
ln(n + 1). That is a narrow space-we have an excellent estimate of s,. The sum of lln

377

10.2 Convergence Tests: Positive Series
and the integral of 1/x diverge together. Problem 43 will show that the difference
between s, and In n approaches "Euler's constant," which is y = .577 ....

Main point: Rectangular area is sn. Curved area is close. We are using integrals to
help with sums (it used to be the opposite).
Question If a computer adds a million terms every second for a million years, how
large is the partial sum of the harmonic series?
Answer The number of terms is n = 602 *24 * 365 "1012 < 3.2 - 1019. Therefore In n
is less than In3.2 + 19 In 10 < 45. By the integral test s.< 1 + Inn, the partial sum
after a million years has not reached 46.
For other series, 1/x changes to a different function y(x). At x = n this function
must equal an. Also y(x) must be decreasing. Then a rectangle of height an is above
the graph to the right of x = n, and below the graph to the left of x = n. The series
and the integral box each other in: left sum > integral > right sum. The reasoning is
the same as it was for a,= 1/n and y(x) = llx: There is finite area in the rectangles

when there is finite area under the curve.
When we can't add the a's, we integrate y(x) and compare areas:

The borderline case p = 1 is the harmonic series (divergent). By the comparison
test, every p < 1 also produces divergence. Thus 11/ n diverges by comparison with
Sdxl/x (and also by comparison with l1/n). Section 7.5 on improper integrals runs
parallel to this section on "improper sums" (infinite series).
Notice the special cases p = 2 and p = 3. The series 1 + 1 + + ...
- converges. Euler
2
found it /6 as its sum. The series 1 + + -L + "'also converges. That is proved by

comparing Z1/n 3 with 11/n

2

or with 5 dx/x 3 . But the sum for p = 3 is unknown.

Extra credit problem The sum of the p-series leads to the most important problem
in pure mathematics. The "zeta function" is Z(p) = I1/n P , so Z(2) = ir2/6 and Z(3) is
unknown. Riemann studied the complex numbers p where Z(p) = 0 (there are infinitely many). He conjectured that the real part of those p is always ½.That has been

tested for the first billion zeros, but never proved.
COMPARISON WITH THE GEOMETRIC SERIES
We can compare any new series aI + a2 + ... with 1 + x + --. Remember that the
first million terms have nothing to do with convergence. It is further out, as n - oo,
that the comparison stands or falls. We still assume that an > 0.

10 Infinite Series

1OD (Ratio test) If a, + I/an approaches a limit L < 1, the series converges.
10E (Root test) If the nth root

approaches L c 1, the series converges.

Roughly speaking, these tests make a, comparable with Ln-therefore convergent.
The tests also establish divergence if L > 1. They give no decision when L = 1. Unfortunately L = 1 is the most important and the hardest case.
On the other hand, you will now see that the ratio test is fairly easy.
The geometric series x + x 2 + -.. has ratio exactly x. The nth root is
also exactly x. So L = x. There is convergence if x < 1 (known) and divergence if x > 1
(also known). The divergence of 1 + 1 + -.. is too delicate (!) for the ratio test and
root test, because L = 1.

EXAMPLE 4

The p-series has a, = l/nP and a,+ ,/a, = nP/(n+
The limit as n -+ co
is L = 1, for every p. The ratio test does not feel the difference between p = 2 (convergence) and p = 1 (divergence) or even p = - 1 (extreme divergence). Neither does the
root test. So the integral test is sharper.

It is 1x1 < 1 that decides convergence, not p. The powers xn are stronger than any nP.
The factorials n! will now prove stronger than any xn.
EXAMPLE 7

The exponential series ex = 1 + x + i x 2 + &x3+ ... converges for all x.

The terms of this series are xn/n! The ratio between neighboring terms is
xn+l/(n+ l)! - x
-which approaches L = 0 as n -+ cc
xn/n!
n + 1'

z

With x = 1, this ratio test gives convergence of l/n! The sum is e. With x = 4, the
larger series 4"/n! also converges. We know this sum too-it is e4. Also the sum
of xnnP/n!converges for any x and p. Again L = 0-the ratio test is not even close.
The factorials take over, and give convergence.
Here is the proof of convergence when the ratios approach L < 1. Choose x halfway
from L to 1. Then x < 1. Eventually the ratios go below x and stay below:

<
aN+3/aN+2< X
Multiply the first two inequalities. Then multiply all three:
U N + I / U Nx<

a ~ + 2 / a ~ + 1

"'

,

Therefore a,+ + a,+, + a,+, + -.. is less than a,(x + x2 + x3 + ...). Since x < 1,
comparison with the geometric series gives convergence.
EXAMPLE 8 The series
l/nn is ideal for the root test. The nth root is ljn. Its
limit is L = 0. Convergence is even faster than for e = l/n! The root test is easily
explained, since (an)ll"< x yields a, < x n and x is close to L < 1. So we compare with
the geometric series.

10.2 Convergence Tests: Positive Series
SUMMARY FOR POSITIVE SERIES
The convergence of geometric series and p-series and exponential series is settled. I
will put these an's in a line, going from most divergent to most convergent. The
crossover to convergence is after 1/n:

You should know that this crossover is not as sharp as it looks. On the convergent
side, 1/n(In n)2 comes before all those p-series. On the divergent side, 1/n(ln n) and
1/n(ln n)(ln In n) belong after 1/n. For any divergent (or convergent) series, there is
another that diverges (or converges) more slowly.
Thus there is no hope of an ultimate all-purpose comparison test. But comparison
is the best method available. Every series in that line can be compared with its
neighbors, and other series can be placed in between. It is a topic that is understood
best by examples.

The indefinite integrals are - 1/In x and In(In x). The first goes to zero as x - co; the
integral and series both converge. The second integral In(In x) goes to infinity-very
slowly but it gets there. So the second series diverges. These examples squeeze new
series into the line, closer to the crossover.

1/2n is 1/2 times E 1/n, so both series diverge. Two series behave in the same
way if the ratios an/b, approach L > 0. Examples 11-12 have n2/(n2 + 1) -+ 1 and
2n/(2n - 1)-> 1. That leads to our final test:
1OF (Limit comparison test) If the ratio an/bn approaches a positive limit L,
then E an and E bn either both diverge or both converge.
Reason: an is smaller than 2Lb, and larger than ½Lbn , at least when n is large. So the
two series behave in the same way. For example C sin (7/nP) converges for p > 1,
not for p < 1. It behaves like 1 1/np (here L = 7). The tail end of a series (large n)
controls convergence. The front end (small n) controls most of the sum.
There are many more series to be investigated by comparison.

change all signs to + , the geometric series would still converge (to the larger sum 2).

DEFINITION The series Z a, is "absolutely convergent" if Z la,[ is convergent.

Infinite Series

Changing a negative number from a, to Ia,l increases the sum. Main point: The
smaller series Y a, is sure to converge if I la,,l converges.
4OG If Y a, converges then I a,, converges (absolutely). But I a,, might converge, as in the series for 7, even if I fa,. diverges to infinity.
EXAMPLE 4 Start with the positive series +1 + + . Change any signs to minus.
Then the new series converges (absolutely). The right choice of signs will make it
converge to any number between -1 and 1.
+. which converges to
+
EXAMPLE 2 Start with the alternating series 1-½+In2. Change to plus signs. The new series 1 + +½+ ... diverges to infinity. The
original alternating series was not absolutely convergent. It was only "conditionally
convergent." A series can converge (conditionally) by a careful choice of signs-even
if Ila,,l = co.
If I la,n, converges then I a, converges. Here is a quick proof. The numbers a, + la,I
are either zero (if a, is negative) or 21a,l. By comparison with I 21an, which converges,
The difference
Y (a, + lan) must converge. Now subtract the convergent series I Ian,.
I a, also converges, completing the proof. All tests for positive series (integral, ratio,
comparison, ...) apply immediately to absolute convergence, because we switch to

la,n.
EXAMPLE 3 Start with the geometric series +4± + + + " which converges to -.
Change any of those signs to minus. Then the new series must converge (absolutely).
But the sign changes cannot achieve all sums between - 1 and 4. This time the sums
belong to the famous (and very thin) Cantor set of Section 3.7.
EXAMPLE 4 (looking ahead) Suppose I a,x" converges for a particular number x.
Then for every x nearer to zero, it converges absolutely. This will be proved and used
in Section 10.6 on power series, where it is the most important step in the theory.
EXAMPLE 5 Since Y 1/n2 converges, so does I (cos n)/n 2. That second series has
irregular signs, but it converges absolutely by comparison with the first series (since
Icos ni < 1). Probably I (tan n)/n 2 does not converge, because the tangent does not
stay bounded like the cosine.
ALTERNATING SERIES
The series 1 - 1+-4 + ... converges to In2. That was stated without proof. This
is an example of an alternating series, in which the signs alternate between plus and
minus. There is the additional property that the absolute values 1, 1,1, , ... decrease
to zero. Those two facts-decrease to zero with alternating signs-guarantee
convergence.
An alternating series a, - a2 a3 - a4 .. converges (at least conditionally, maybe not absolutely) if every a,,, 1 < a. and a, -40.

IOH

The best proof is in Figure 10.3. Look at a, - a 2 + a 3. It is below a,, because a3 (with
plus sign) is smaller than a 2 (with minus sign). The sum of five terms is less than the

sum of three terms, because a, is smaller than a4. These partial sums s,, s3, s5, ...
with an odd number of terms are decreasing.
Now look at two terms a, - a2, then four terms, then six terms. Adding on a3 - a,
increases the sum (because a3 2 a,). Similarly s, is greater than s4 (because it includes
a, - a6 which is positive). So the sums s2, s4, S6, ... are increasing.
The difference between s, - and s, is the single number a,. It is required by 10H
to approach zero. Therefore the decreasing sequence s, ,s3, ... approaches the same
limit s as the increasing sequence s,, s4, ... . The series converges to s, which always
lies between s, - and s,.
This plus-minus pattern is special but important. The positive series Xa, may not
converge. The alternating series is X(- lr+'a,.

requirement in 10H is not met? The partial sums s1,s3, s,, ... all equal 1 and
s2, s,, S6, ... all equal 0-but they don't approach the same limit s.
MULTIPLYING AND REARRANGING SERIES

In Section 10.1 we added and subtracted and multiplied series. Certainly addition
and subtraction are safe. If one series has partial sums s, + s and the other has partial
sums t, + t, then addition gives partial sums s, + t, -,s + t. But multiplication is
more dangerous, because the order of the multiplication can make a difference. More
exactly, the order of terms is important when the series are conditionally convergent.
For absolutely convergent series, the order makes no difference. We can rearrange
their terms and multiply them in any order, and the sum and product comes out
right:

Rather than proving 101 and 10J, we show what happens when there is only condiconverging conditionally to
tional convergence. Our favorite is 1 - 4+ f - 4+
..a,

10 Infinite Serles

In 2. By rearranging, it will converge conditionally to anything! Suppose the desired
sum is 1000. Take positive terms 1 5 + until they pass 1000. Then add negative
terms -;-;... until the subtotal drops below 1000. Then new positive terms
bring it above 1000, and so on. All terms are eventually used, since at least one new
term is needed at each step. The limit is s = 1000.
We also get strange products, when series fail to converge absolutely:

+

On the left the series converge (conditionally). The alternating terms go to zero. On
the right the series diverges. Its terms in parentheses don't even approach zero, and
the product is completely wrong.
I close by emphasizing that it is absolute convergence that matters. The most
important series are power series Eanxn.Like the geometric series (with all a, = 1)
there is absolute convergence over an interval of x's. They give functions of x, which
is what calculus needs and wants.
We go next to the series for ex, which is absolutely convergent everywhere. From
the viewpoint of convergence tests it is too easy-the danger is gone. But from the
viewpoint of calculus and its applications, ex is unconditionally the best.

a,, the constant term) and its sum isf (x) = 1/(1- x). The derivatives of 1 x x2 --.
match the derivatives off. Now we choose the an differently, to match a different
function.
The new function is ex. All its derivatives are ex. At x = 0, this function and its
derivatives equal 1. To match these l's, we move factorials into the denominators.

2.71828 .... At x = - 1 the series gives 1- 1 + f - + -, which is e-'.
The same term-by-term idea works for differential equations, as follows.

Solution The zeroth derivative at x = 0 is thefunction itseg y = 1. Then the equation

1, -1, 1, - 1, ... are matched by the alternating series for e-":
y = 1 - x + t x 2 - i x 3 + ... - e - X (the correct solution to y' = - y).
EXAMPLE 2 Solve d'y/dx2 = - y starting from y = 1 and y' = 0 (the answer is cos x).

Solution The equation gives y" = - 1(again at x = 0). The derivativeof the equation

The idea of matching derivatives by powers is becoming central to this chapter. The
derivatives are given at a basepoint (say x = 0). They are numbers f (O),f '(O), .... The

The first terms give the linear and quadratic approximations that we know well. The
x3 term was mentioned earlier (but not used). Now we have all the terms-an "infinite
approximation" that is intended to equalf(x).
Two things are needed. First, the series must converge. Second, the function must
do what the series predicts, away from x = 0. Those are true for ex and cos x and
sin x; the series equals the function. We proceed on that basis.
The Taylor series with special basepoint x = 0 is also called the "Maclaurin series."

EXAMPLE 4 Find the Taylor series forf(x) = (1 + x)5 around x = 0.

second derivative is 5 . 4 .(1 + x)3 , so f "(0)= 5 4. The next three derivatives are
5 . 4 *3, 5 *4 . 3 *2, 5 . 4 . 3 *2 * 1. After that all derivatives are zero. Therefore the Taylor
series stops after the x s term:

There is no doubt that x = 0 is the nicest basepoint. But Taylor series can be constructed around other points x = a. The principle is the same-match derivatives by

powers-but now the powers to use are (x - a)". The derivatives f("'(a) are computed
at the new basepoint x = a.
The Taylor series begins with f(a) +f'(a)(x - a). This is the tangent approximation

at x = a. The whole "infinite approximation" is centered at a-at that point it has
the same derivatives as f(x).

That Taylor series (which stops at n = 5) should agree with (1 x)'. It does. We could
rewrite 1 x as 2 (x - I), and take its fifth power directly. Then 32, 16, 8,4,2, 1 will
multiply the usual coefficients 1,.5, 10, 10, 5, 1 to give our Taylor coefficients
32, 80, 80,40, 10, 1. The series stops as it will stop for any polynomial-because the
high derivatives are zero.

EXAMPLE 6 Find the Taylor series for f(x) = ex around the basepoint x = 1.

Solution At x = 1 the function and all its derivatives equal e. Therefore the
Taylor series has that constant factor (note the powers of x - 1, not x):

DEFINING THE FUNCTION BY ITS SERIES

Usually, we define sin x and cos x from the sides of a triangle. But we could start
instead with the series. Define sin x by equation (2). The logic goes backward, but it
is still correct:
First, prove that the series converges.
Second, prove properties like (sin x)' = cos x.
Third, connect the definitions by series to the sides of a triangle.
We don't plan to do all this. The usual definition was good enough. But note first:
There is no problem with convergence. The series for sin x and cos x and ex all have
terms fxn/n!. The factorials make the series converge for all x. The general rule for
ex times eYcan be based on the series. Equation (6) is typical: e is multiplied by
powers of (x - 1). Those powers add to ex-'. So the series proves that ex = eex-'.
= ex+Y:
That is just one example of the multiplication (ex)(eY)

Term by term, multiplication gives the series for ex+Y.Term by term, differentiating
the series for ex gives ex. Term by term, the derivative of sin x is cos x:

We don't need the famous limit (sin x)/x -, 1, by which geometry gave us the derivative. The identities of trigonometry become identities of infinite series. We could even
define n as the first positive x at which x - i x 3 + .--equals zero. But it is certainly
not obvious that this sine series returns to zero-much less that the point of return
is near 3.14.
The function that will be dejined by injnite series is eie. This is the exponential of
the imaginary number i0 (a multiple of i =

You recognize those series. They are cos 8 and sin 8. Therefore:
y = r sin 8
eie = cos 0 + i sine

I

Euler's formula is eie= cos 8 + i sin 8. Note that e2"' = 1.

The real part is x = cos 8 and the imaginary part is y = sin 8. Those coordinates pick
out the point eiBin the "complex plane." Its distance from the origin (0,O) is r = 1,
because (cos 8)2+ (sin 8)2= 1. Its angle is 8, as shown in Figure 10.5. The number
-1 is ei", at the distance r = l and the angle n. It is on the real axis to the left of
zero. If eiBis multiplied by r = 2 or r = 3 or any r 2 0, the result is a complex number
at a distance r from the origin:

x=r'cose 1 Rg. 10.5

Complex numbers: reiB= r(cos 8 + i sin 8) = r cos 8 + ir sin 8 = x + iy.

With eie, a negative number has a logarithm. The logarithm of - 1 is imaginary
(it is in, since ei" = - 1). A negative number also has fractional powers. The fourth
root of - 1 is (- l)'I4 = einI4.More important for calculus: The derivative of x5I4 is
$x1I4. That sounds old and familiar, but at x = - 1 it was never allowed.
Complex numbers tie up the loose ends left by the limitations of real numbers.

+

The formula eie= cos 8 i sin 8 has been called "one of the greatest mysteries of
undergraduate mathematics." Writers have used desperate methods to avoid infinite
series. That proof in (10) may be the clearest (I remember sending it to a prisoner
studying calculus) but here is a way to start from d/dx(eix)= ieix.
A diferent proof of Euler'sformula Any complex number is eix= r(cos 8 + i sin 8)
for some r and 8. Take the x derivative of both sides, and substitute for ieix:
(cos 8 + i sin B)dr/dx + r(- sin 8 + i cos B)d8/dx = ir(cos 8 + i sin 9).
Comparing the real parts and also the imaginary parts, we need drldx = 0 and
d8/dx = 1. The starting values r = 1 and 8 = 0 are known from eiO= 1. Therefore r is
always 1 and 8 is x. Substituting into the first sentence of the proof, we have Euler's
formula eie= l(cos 8 + i sin 8).

10.5 Power Series

10.5 Power Series
This section studies the properties of a power series. When the basepoint is zero, the
powers are x". The series is anx". When the basepoint is x = a, the powers are
(x - a)". We want to know when and where (and how quickly) the series converges
to the underlying function. For ex and cos x and sin x there is convergence for all
x-but that is certainly not true for 1/(1 - x). The convergence is best when the
function is smooth.
First I emphasize that power series are not the only series. For many applications
they are not the best choice. An alternative is a sum of sines, f(x) = b,sin nx. That
is a "Fouriersine series", which treats all x's equally instead of picking on a basepoint.
A Fourier series allows jumps and corners in the graph-it takes the rough with the
smooth. By contrast a power series is terrific near its basepoint, and gets worse as
you move away. The Taylor coefficients an are totally determined at the basepoint-where all derivatives are computed. Remember the rule for Taylor series:
an = (nth derivative at the basepoint)/n! =f(")(a)/n!
A remarkable fact is the convergence in a symmetric interval around x = a.

(1)

40M A power series Zax" either converges for all x, or it converges only at
the basepoint x =0, or else it has a radius of convergence r:
Ylax" converges absolutely if lxl
< r and diverges ifxi > r.
The series Ix"/n! converges for all x (the sum is ex). The series In!x" converges for
no x (except x = 0). The geometric series Ex" converges absolutely for Ixl < 1 and
diverges for Ixl
> 1. Its radius of convergence is r = 1. Note that its sum 1/(1 - x) is
perfectly good for Ix> 1-the function is all right but the series has given up. If
something goes wrong at the distance r, a power series can't get past that point.
When the basepoint is x = a, the interval of convergence shifts over to Ix - al < r.
The series converges for x between a - r and a + r (symmetric around a). We cannot
say in advance whether the endpoints a + r give divergence or convergence (absolute
or conditional). Inside the interval, an easy comparison test will now prove convergence.
PROOF OF 10M Suppose Ya,X" converges at a particular point X. The proof will
show that Ia,x" converges when Ixi
is less than the number IXI. Thus convergence
at X gives convergence at all closer points x (I mean closer to the basepoint 0). Proof:
Since I anX" converges, its terms approach zero. Eventually lanX"I < 1 and then

Iaxnl = IaX"I Ix/lX

< Ix/XI".

Our series I a,x" is absolutely convergent by comparison with the geometric series
for Ix/XI, which converges since Ix/XI < 1.
EXAMPLE 1 The series Inx"/4" has radius of convergence r = 4.
The ratio test and root test are best for power series. The ratios between terms
approach x/4 (and so does the nth root of nx"/4"):
(n + 1)x"+' Inx"

The ratio test gives convergence if L < 1, which means Ixl < 4.

EXAMPLE 2 The sine series x -

+ 3! 5!

has r = co (it converges everywhere).

The ratio of xn+ 2/(n + 2)! to x"/n! is x 2/(n + 2)(n + 1). This approaches L = 0.
EXAMPLE 3

The series I(x - 5)"/n 2 has radius r = 1 around its basepoint a = 5.

The ratios between terms approach L = x - 5. (The fractions n2/(n + 1)2 go toward

1.) There is absolute convergence if Ix - 51 < 1. This is the interval 4 < x < 6, symmetric around the basepoint. This series happens to converge at the endpoints 4 and 6,
because of the factor 1/n2 . That factor decides the delicate question-convergence at
the endpoints-but all powers of n give the same interval of convergence 4 < x < 6.
CONVERGENCE TO THE FUNCTION: REMAINDER TERM AND RADIUS r

Remember that a Taylor series starts with a function f(x). The derivatives at the
basepoint produce the series. Suppose the series converges: Does it converge to
the function? This is a question about the remainderR,(x) =f(x) - sn(x), which is the
difference between f and the partial sum s, = ao + " + an(x - a)". The remainder Rn
is the error if we stop the series, ending with the nth derivative term a,(x - a)".

10N Suppose f has an (n + 1)st derivative from the basepoint a out to x. Then
for some point c in between (position not known) the remainder at x equals
R,(x)= f(x) - s,(x) = f("+ 1)(c)(x - a)" +'/(n + 1)!

(2)

The error in stopping at the nth derivative is controlled by the (n + 1)st derivative.
You will guess, correctly, that the unknown point c comes from the Mean Value
Theorem. For n = 1 the proof is at the end of Section 3.8. That was the error e(x) in
linear approximation:
R1 (x) = f(x) - f(a) - f'(a)(x - a) =

f "(c)(x - a)2.

"

For every n, the proof compares Rn with (x - a) +1. Their (n + 1)st derivatives are
and (n + 1)! The generalized Mean Value Theorem says that the ratio of R, to
f(n+ ')
(x - a)" + equals the ratio of those derivatives, at the right point c. That is equation
(2). The details can stay in Section 3.8 and Problem 23, because the main point is
what we want. The error is exactly like the next term a,+ (x - a)" +1, except that the
(n + 1)st derivative is at c instead of the basepoint a.
EXAMPLE 4

Whenf is ex, the (n + 1)st derivative is ex. Therefore the error is
Rn=ex - 1 +x+ ... + -

"

= ec

n! = (n+ 1)!*

(3)

At x = 1 and n = 2, the error is e - (1 + 1 + ) .218. The right side is ec/6. The
unknown point is c = In(.218 - 6) = .27. Thus c lies between the basepoint a = 0 and
the error point x = 1, as required. The series converges to the function, because
R, - 0.

In practice, n is the number of derivatives to be calculated. We may aim for an
error IRn, below 10- 6. Unfortunately, the high derivative in formula (2) is awkward
to estimate (except for ex). And high derivatives in formula (1) are difficult to compute.
Most real calculations use only afew terms of a Taylor series. For more accuracy we
move the basepoint closer, or switch to another series.

10.5 Power Serles

There is a direct connection between the function and the convergence radius r.
also ends
the convergence interval for the series. Another hint comes for f = llx, if we expand
around x = a = 1:

A hint came for f(x) = 1/(1- x). The function blows up at x = 1-which

This geometric series converges for 11 - XI< 1. Convergence stops at the end point
x = 0-exactly where llx blows up. The failure of the function stops the convergence
of the series. But note that 1/(1+ x2), which never seems to fail, also has convergence
radius r = 1:
1/(1+ x2) = 1 - x2 + x4 - x6 +

converges only for 1x1 < 1.

When you see the reason, you will know why r is a "radius." There is a circle, and
the function fails at the edge of the circle. The circle contains complex numbers as
well as real numbers. The imaginary points i and - i are at the edge of the circle.
The function fails at those points because l/(l + i2)= co.
Complex numbers are pulling the strings, out of sight. The circle of convergence
reaches out to the nearest "singularity" of f(x), real or imaginary or complex. For
1/(1+ x2), the singularities at i and - i make r = 1. If we expand around a = 3, the
distance to i and - i is r = ,/%. If we change to in (1 + x), which blows up at
X = - 1, the radius of convergence of x - $x2 + gx3is r = 1.

THE BINOMIAL SERIES

We close this chapter with one more series. It is the Taylor series for (1 + x ) ~around
,
the basepoint x = 0.A typical power is p = 3, where we want the terms in

JK=
1+ f x + a 2 x 2 +

em-.

The slow way is to square both sides, which gives 1 + x + (2a2+ $)x2 on the right.
Since 1 + x is on the left, a2 = - & is needed to remove the x2 term. Eventually a,
can be found. The fast way is to match the derivatives off = (1 + x)'I2:

At x = 0 those derivatives are 4,- i,
8. Dividing by I!, 2!, 3! gives

These are the binomial coeficients when the power is p = 4.
Notice the difference from the binomials in Chapter 2. For those, the power p was
~ 1 2x + x2 stopped at x2. The coefficients for
a positive integer. The series (1 + x ) =
p = 2 were 1,2, 1,0,0,0, .... For fractional p or negative p those later coefficients are
not zero, and we find them from the derivatives of (1 + x ) ~ :

+

Dividing by O!, I!, 2!, ..., n! at x = 0, the binomial coefficients are

For p = n that last binomial coefficient is n!/n! = 1. It gives the final xn at the end of
(1 + x)". For other values of p, the binomial series never stops. It convergesfor 1x1< 1:

When p = 1,2, 3, ... the binomial coeflcient p!/n!(n - p)! counts the number of ways
to select a group of n friends out of a group of p friends. If you have 20 friends, you
can choose 2 of them in (20)(19)/2= 190 ways.

, higher derivatives blow up. Only for a positive
If p is positive, as in ,/=
integer p = n does the convergence radius move out to r = GO. In that case the series
for (1 + x)" stops at xn, and f never fails.
A power series is a function in a new form. It is not a simple form, but sometimes
it is the only form. To compute f we have to sum the series. To square f we have to
multiply series. But the operations of calculus-derivative and integral-are easier.
That explains why power series help to solve differential equations, which are a rich
source of new functions. (Numerically the series are not always so good.) I should
have said that the derivative and integral are easy for each separate term anxn-and
fortunately the convergence radius of the whole series is not changed.

Iff (x) = Xanxnhas convergence radius r, so do its derivative and its integral:
df/dx = C nanxn-' and

If (x)dx= Z anxn '/(n + 1) also converge for 1x1 < r.

EXAMPLE 5 The series for 1/(1- x) and its derivative 1/(1- x ) ~and its integral
- ln(1 - x) all have r = 1 (because they all have trouble at x = 1). The series are Exn
and Enxn-' and Cxn+'/(n + 1).
EXAMPLE 6 We can integrate ex' (previously impossible) by integrating every term
in its series:

This always converges (r = a).The derivative of ex' was never a problem.

Vectors and Matrices

This chapter opens up a new part of calculus. It is multidimensional calculus, because
the subject moves into more dimensions. In the first ten chapters, all functions
depended on time t or position x-but not both. We had f(t) or y(x). The graphs
were curves in a plane. There was one independent variable (x or t) and one dependent
variable (y or f). Now we meet functions f(x, t) that depend on both x and t. Their
graphs are surfaces instead of curves. This brings us to the calculus of several variables.
Start with the surface that represents the function f(x, t) or f(x, y) or f(x, y,,t). I
emphasize functions, because that is what calculus is about.
EXAMPLE 1 f(x, t) = cos (x - t) is a traveling wave (cosine curve in motion).

At t = 0 the curve is f = cos x. At a later time, the curve moves to the right
(Figure 11.1). At each t we get a cross-section of the whole x-t surface. For a wave
traveling along a string, the height depends on position as well as time.
A similar function gives a wave going around a stadium. Each person stands up
and sits down. Somehow the wave travels.
EXAMPLE 2 f (x, y) = 3x + y + 1 is a sloping roof (fixed in time).

The surface is two-dimensional-you can walk around on it. It is flat because
3x y + 1 is a linear function. In the y direction the surface goes up at 45". If y
increases by 1, so doesf . That slope is 1. In the x direction the roof is steeper (slope 3).
There is a direction in between where the roof is steepest (slope

+

fi).

EXAMPLE 3 f (x, y, t) = cos(x - y - t) is an ocean surface with traveling waves.

This surface moves. At each time t we have a new x-y surface. There are three
variables, x and y for position and t for time. I can't draw the function, it needs four
dimensions! The base coordinates are x, y, t and the height is f. The alternative is a
movie that shows the x-y surface changing with t.
At time t = 0 the ocean surface is given by cos (x - y). The waves are in straight
lines. The line x - y = 0 follows a crest because cos 0 = 1. The top of the next wave
is on the parallel line x - y = 2n, because cos 2n = 1. Figure 11.1 shows the ocean
surface at a fixed time.
The line x - y = t gives the crest at time t. The water goes up and down (like people
in a stadium). The wave goes to shore, but the water stays in the ocean.

Of course multidimensional calculus is not only for waves. In business, demand is
a function of price and date. In engineering, the velocity and temperature depend on
position x and time t . Biology deals with many variables at once (and statistics is
always looking for linear relations like z = x + 2y). A serious job lies ahead, to carry
derivatives and integrals into more dimensions.

In a plane, every point is described by two numbers. We measure across by x and
up by y. Starting from the origin we reach the point with coordinates (x, y). I want
to describe this movement by a vector-the straight line that starts at (0,O) and ends
at (x, y). This vector v has a direction, which goes from (0,O) to (x, y) and not the
other way.
In a picture, the vector is shown by an arrow. In algebra, v is given by its two
components. For a column vector, write x above y:

v=

[,I

(x and y are the components of v).

Note that v is printed in boldface; its components x and y are in lightface.? The
vector - v in the opposite direction changes signs. Adding v to - v gives the zero
vector (different from the zero number and also in boldface):
and

v v = [

X-X

-0.

Notice how vector addition or subtraction is done separately on the x's and y's:

?Another way to indicate a vector is 2 You will recognize vectors without needing arrows.

11.I Vectors and Dot Products

Fig. 11.3 Parallelogram for v + w, stretching for 2v, signs reversed for -v.

The vector v has components v , = 3 and v, = 1. (I write v, for the first component
and v, for the second component. I also write x and y, which is fine for two components.) The vector w has w , = - 1 and w, = 2. To add the vectors, add the components. To draw this addition, place the start of w at the end of v. Figure 11.3 shows
how w starts where v ends.
VECTORS WITHOUT COORDINATES

In that head-to-tail addition of v + w, we did something new. The vector w was moved
away from the origin. Its length and direction were not changed! The new arrow is
parallel to the old arrow-only the starting point is different. The vector is the same
as before.
A vector can be defined without an origin and without x and y axes. The purpose
of axes is to give the components-the separate distances x and y. Those numbers
are necessary for calculations. But x and y coordinates are not necessary for headto-tail addition v + w, or for stretching to 2v, or for linear combinations 2v + 3w.
Some applications depend on coordinates, others don't.
Generally speaking, physics works without axes-it is "coordinate-free." A velocity
has direction and magnitude, but it is not tied to a point. A force also has direction
and magnitude, but it can act anywhere-not only at the origin. In contrast, a vector
that gives the prices of five stocks is not floating in space. Each component has a
meaning-there are five axes, and we know when prices are zero. After examples
from geometry and physics (no axes), we return to vectors with coordinates.
EXAMPLE 1 (Geometry) Take any four-sided figure in space. Connect the midpoints
of the four straight sides. Remarkable fact: Those four midpoints lie in the same plane.
More than that, they form a parallelogram.

Frankly, this is amazing. Figure 11.4a cannot do justice to the problem, because it
is printed on a flat page. Imagine the vectors A and D coming upward. B and C go
down at different angles. Notice how easily we indicate the four sides as vectors, not
caring about axes or origin.
I will prove that V = W. That shows that the midpoints form a parallelogram.
What is V? It starts halfway along A and ends halfway along B. The small triangle
at the bottom shows V = $A + 3B. This is vector addition-the tail of 3B is at the
head of 4A. Together they equal the shortcut V. For the same reason W = 3C + 3D.
The heart of the proof is to see these relationships.
One step is left. Why is +A + 3B equal to $C + i D ? In other words, why is A + B
equal to C + D? (I multiplied by 2.) When the right question is asked, the answer
jumps out. A head-to-tail addition A + B brings us to the point R. Also C + D brings
us to R. The proof comes down to one line:
A + B = P R = C + D . Then V = + A + $ B e q u a l s W = + C + + D .

EXAMPLE 3 (Medicine) An electrocardiogram shows the sum of many small vectors,
the voltages in the wall of the heart. What happens to this sum-the heart vector
V-in two cases that a cardiologist is watching for?
Case 1 . Part of the heart is dead (infarction).
Case 2. Part of the heart is abnormally thick (hypertrophy).

A heart attack kills part of the muscle. A defective valve, or hypertension, overworks
it. In case 1the cells die from the cutoff of blood (loss of oxygen). In case 2 the heart
wall can triple in size, from excess pressure. The causes can be chemical or mechanical.
The effect we see is electrical.
The machine is adding small vectors and bbprojecting"them in twelve directions. The
leads on the arms, left leg, and chest give twelve directions in the body. Each graph
shows the component of V in one of those directions. Three of the projectionstwo in the vertical plane, plus lead 2 for front-back-produce the "mean QRS vector"
in Figure 11.5. That is the sum V when the ventricles start to contract. The left
ventricle is larger, so the heart vector normally points down and to the left.

Fig. 11.6 Changes in V show dead muscle and overworked muscle.

We come soon to projections, but here the question is about V itself. How does
the ECCi identify the problem?
Case 1: Heart attack The dead cells make no contribution to the electricid potential. Some small vectors are missing. Therefore the sum V
turns away from the infarcted part.
Chse 2: Hypertrophy The overwork increases the contribution to the
potential. Some vectors are larger than normal. Therefore V turns
toward the thickened part.

When V points in an abnormal direction, the ECG graphs locate the problem. The
P, Q, R, S, T waves on separate graphs can all indicate hypertrophy, in different
regions of the heart. Infarctions generally occur in the left ventricle, which needs the
greatest blood supply. When the supply of oxygen is cut back, that ventricle feels it
first. The result can be a heart attack (= myocardial infarction = coronary occlusion).
Section 11.2 shows how the projections on the ECG point to the location.
First come the basic facts about vectors-components, lengths, and dot products.
COORDINATE VECTORS AND LENGTH

To compute with vectors we need axes and coordinates. The picture of the heart is
"coordinate-free," but calculations require numbers. A vector is known by its components. The unit vectors along the axes are i and j in the plane and i, j, k in space:

Notice h~oweasily we moved into three dimensions! The only change is that vectors
have three components. The combinations of i and j (or i, j, k) produce all vectors v
in the plane (and all vectors V in space):

S11

402

Vectors and Matrices

Those vectors arealso written v = (3, 1)andV = (1, 2, - 2). The components of the vector
are also the coordinates of a point. (The vector goes from the origin to the point.) This
relation between point and vector is so close that we allow them the same notation:
P = (x, y, z)and v = (x, y, z) = xi + yj + zk.
The sum v + V is totally meaningless. Those vectors live in different dimensions.
From the components we find the length. The length of (3, 1) is 32 + 12 = 10.
This comes directly from a right triangle. In three dimensions, V has a third component to be squared and added. The length of V = (x, y, z) is IVI = x 2 + Y2 + z2.
Vertical bars indicate length, which takes the place of absolute value. The length
of v = 3i + j is the distance from the point (0, 0) to the point (3, 1):

IvI=

v+

v= /10

IVl =

12+ 22 + (-2)2 = 3.

A unit vector is a vector of length one. Dividing v and V by their lengths produces
unit vectors in the same directions:

1/3

L-2/3
S

Each
IvAnonzero vector has a positive length vj. The direction of v is given

by a unit vector u = v/lvI. Then length times direction equals v.
A unit vector in the plane is determined by its angle 0 with the x axis:
u=

LsinO]

In 3-space the components of a unit vector are its "direction cosines":
U = (cos a)i + (cos l)j + (cos y)k:

o, fl, y = angles with x, y, z axes.

Then cos 2a + cos 2f + cos 2 y = 1. We are doing algebra with numbers while we are
doing geometry with vectors. It was the great contribution of Descartes to see how
to study algebra and geometry at the same time.

THE DOT PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS
There are two basic operations on vectors. First, vectors are added (v+ w). Second,
a vector is multiplied by a scalar (7v or - 2w). That leaves a natural question-how
do you multiply two vectors? The main part of the answer is-you don't. But there

403

11.1 Vectors and Dot Products

is an extremely important operation that begins with two vectors and produces a
number. It is usually indicated by a dot between the vectors, as in v - w, so it is called
the dot product.
DEFINITION I

The dot product multiplies the lengths Ivl times Iwl times a cosine:
v * w = iv IwlI cos 0, 0 = angle between v and w.

EXAMPLE

I0has length 3, 2Ihas length /8, the angle is 45 .

The dot product is Ivl |wl cos 0 = (3)( )(1/
), which simplifies to 6. The square
roots in the lengths are "canceled" by square roots in the cosine. For computing v . w,
a second and much simpler way involves no square roots in the first place.
DEFINITION 2

The dot product v * w multiplies component by component and adds:
V*W = V 1 W

The first form Ivl Iwl cos 0 is coordinate-free. The second form vlw, + v 2W2 computes
with coordinates. Remark 4 explains why these two forms are equal.

These dot products 32 and 0 equal IVI IWi cos 0. In the second one, cos 0 must be

zero. The angle is 7n/2 or - n/2-in either case a right angle. Fortunately the cosine
is the same for 0 and - 0, so we need not decide the sign of 0.
Remark 1 When V = W the angle is zero but not the cosine! In this case cos 0 = 1
and V . V = IVl2 . The dot product of V with itself is the length squared:

V.V= (V, V2,V3 )(VI,

V2 , V3) = V+ v+ v2 = IV2

Remark 2 The dot product of i = (1, 0, 0) with j = (0, 1, 0) is i j = 0. The axes are
perpendicular. Similarly i -k = 0 and j . k = 0. Those are unit vectors: i i= j =j
k-k= 1.
Remark 3 The dot product has three properties that keep the algebra simple:
1. V-W= WV

2. (cV). W= c(V. W)

3. (U+V).W= UW+V.W

When V is doubled (c = 2) the dot product is doubled. When V is split into i, j, k
components, the dot product splits in three pieces. The same applies to W, since

11 Vectors and Matrices

Fig. 11.8 Length squared = (V - W) (V - W), from coordinates and the cosine law.

V W = W V. The nine dot products of i, j, k are zeros and ones, and a giant splitting
of both V and W gives back the correct V W:

Remark 4 The two forms of the dot product are equal. This comes from computing
IV - wI2 by coordinates and also by the "law of cosines":

+

with coordinates: IV - WI2 = (Vl - Wl)2 (V2 - W2)2+ (V3 - W3)2
from cosine law: IV - WI2 = IV12 + IWI2 - 21VI IWI cos 8.
Compare those two lines. Line 1 contains V: and V: and V:. Their sum matches
IV12 in the cosine law. Also W: W: + W: matches IWI2.Therefore the terms containing - 2 are the same (you can mentally cancel the - 2). The definitions agree:

+

- 2(V1Wl

+ V2W2 + V3W3) equals - 21VI IWI cos 8 equals - 2V

W.

The cosine law is coordinate-free. It applies to all triangles (even in n dimensions).
Its vector form in Figure 11.8 is IV - WI2 = lV12 - 2V W + IWI2. This application to
V W is its brief moment of glory.

Remark 5 The dot product is the best way to compute the cosine of 8:

vow

cos 8 = IVl lWl '
Here are examples of V and W with a range of angles from 0 to n:
i and 3i have the same direction
i (i + j) = 1 is positive
i and j are perpendicular: i j = 0
i.(-i+ j)= - 1 is negative
i and - 3i have opposite directions

cos 8 = 0
cos 8 = - 1 / f i

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality IV WI < IVI I WI comes from lcos 81 < 1.

The left side is IVI IWI lcos 81. It never exceeds the right side IVI IWI. This is a key
inequality in mathematics, from which so many others follow:

In a space without axes and coordinates, the tail of V can
be placed u . Two vectors with the same v are the
same. If a triangle starts with V and continues with W, the
third side is w . The vector connecting the midpoint of V
to the midpoint of W is x . That vector is v the third

11.2 Planes and Projections
The most important "curves" are straight lines. The most important functions are
linear. Those sentences take us back to the beginning of the book-the graph of
mx + b is a line. The goal now is to move into three dimensions, where graphs are
surfaces. Eventually the surfaces will be curved. But calculus starts with the flat
surfaces that correspond to straight lines:
What are the most important surfaces? Planes.
What are the most important functions? Still linear.
The geometrical idea of a plane is turned into algebra, by finding the equation of a
plane. Not just a general formula, but the particular equation of a particular plane.

A line is determined by one point (x,, yo) and the slope m. The point-slope equation
is y - yo = m(x - x,). That is a linear equation, it is satisfied when y = yo and x = xo,
and dyldx is m. For a plane, we start again with a particular point-which is now
(x, ,yo, I:,). But the slope of a plane is not so simple. Many planes climb at a 45"
angle-with "slope 1"-and more information is needed.
The direction of a plane is described by a vector N. The vector is not in the plane,
but perpmdicular to the plane. In the plane, there are many directions. Perpendicular
to the plane, there is only one direction. A vector in that perpendicular direction is
a normal vector.
The normal vector N can point "up" or "down". The length of N is not crucial (we
often make it a unit vector and call it n). Knowing N and the point Po = (x,, yo, z,),
we know the plane (Figure 11.9). For its equation we switch to algebra and use the
dot product-which is the key to perpendicularity.
N is described by its components (a, b, c). In other words N is ai + bj + ck. This
vector is perpendicular to every direction in the plane. A typical direction goes from

(x - xo, y - yo, z - z,). This vector lies in the plane, so its dot product with N is zero:
116 The plane through Po perpendicular to N = (a, b, c) has the equation

(a, b,c)*(x-xo, y-yo, z-zo) = O
4x-x0)

+ qy-yo)+

or

c(z-zo)= 0.

(1)

The point P lies on the plane when its coordinates x, y, z satisfy this equation.
EXAMPLE 1 The plane through Po = (1,2,3) perpendicular to N = (1, 1, 1) has the
equation (x - 1) + (y - 2) + (z - 3) = 0. That can be rewritten as x + y z = 6.

+

Notice three things. First, Po lies on the plane because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Second, N =
(1, 1, 1) can be recognized from the x, y, z coefficients in x + y + z = 6. Third, we could
change N to (2,2,2) and we could change Po to (8,2, - 4)-because N is still perpendicular and Po is still in the plane: 8 + 2 - 4 = 6.
The new normal vector N = (2,2,2) produces 2(x - 1) + 2(y - 2) + 2(z - 3) = 0.
That can be rewritten as 2x + 2y + 22 = 12. Same normal direction, same plane.
The new point Po = (8, 2, - 4) produces (x - 8) + (y - 2) + (z + 4) = 0. That is
another form of x + y + z = 6. All we require is a perpendicular N and a point Po in
the plane.
EXAMPLE 2 The plane through (1,2,4) with the same N = (1, 1, 1) has a different
equation: (x - 1) + (y - 2) + (z - 4) = 0. This is x + y + z = 7 (instead of 6). These
planes with 7 and 6 are parallel.

+

Starting from a(x - x,) + b(y - yo) c(z - 2,) = 0, we often move ax,
to the right hand side-and call this constant d:

+ by, + cz,

1I D With the Poterms on the right side, the equation of the plane is N P = d:
a x + b y + c z = a x o + byo+czo=d.

(2)

A different d gives a puraIle1 plane; d = 0 gives a plane throzcgh the origin.
EXAMPLE 3 The plane x - y + 3z = 0 goes through the origin (0, 0, 0). The normal
vector is read directly from the equation: N = (1, - 1, 3). The equation is satisfied by
Po = (1, 1,O) and P = ( l , 4 , 1). Subtraction gives a vector V = (0, 3, 1) that is in the
plane, and N V = 0.
The parallel planes x - y + 32 = d have the same N but different d's. These planes
miss the origin because d is not zero (x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 on the left side needs d = 0
on the right side). Note that 3x - 3y + 9z = - 15 is parallel to both planes. N is
changed to 3N in Figure 11.9, but its direction is not changed.
EXAMPLE 4

The angle between two planes is the angle between their normal vectors.

The planes x - y + 3z = 0 and 3y + z = 0 are perpendicular, because (1, - 1, 3)
(0, 3, 1) = 0. The planes z = 0 and y = 0 are also perpendicular, because (O,0, 1)
(0, 1,O) = 0. (Those are the xy plane and the xz plane.) The planes x + y = 0 and
x + z = O m a k e a 6 0 ° angle, becausecos60°=(l, 1,0)*(1,0,l)/dfi=+.
The cosine of the angle between two planes is IN, N,I/IN,I IN,I. See Figure 11.10.

Angle between planes = angle between normals. Parallel and perpendicular to a
line. A line in space through P0 and Q.

Remark 1 We gave the "point-slope" equation of a line (using m), and the "pointnormal" equation of a plane (using N). What is the normal vector N to a line?
The vector V = (1, m) is parallel to the line y = mx + b. The line goes across by 1
and up by m. The perpendicular vector is N = (- m, 1). The dot product N V is
- m + m = 0. Then the point-normal equation matches the point-slope equation:
- m(x - x0 ) + 1(y - yo) = 0 is the same as y - yo = m(x - xo).

(3)

Remark 2 What is the point-slope equation for a plane? The difficulty is that a
plane has different slopes in the x and y directions. The function f(x, y)=
m(x - x0 ) + M(y - yo) has two derivatives m and M.
This remark has to stop. In Chapter 13, "slopes" become "partialderivatives."
A LINE IN SPACE
In three dimensions, a line is not as simple as a plane. A line in space needs two
equations. Each equation gives a plane, and the line is the intersection of two planes.
The equations x + y + z = 3 and 2x + 3y + z = 6 determine a line.
Two points on that line are P0 = (1, 1, 1) and Q = (3, 0, 0). They satisfy both equations
so they lie on both planes. Therefore they are on the line of intersection. The direction
of that line, subtracting coordinates of P0 from Q, is along the vector V = 2i - j - k.
The line goes through P0 = (1, 1, 1) in the direction of V = 2i - j - k.
Starting from (xo, Yo, zo) = (1, 1, 1), add on any multiple tV. Then x = 1 + 2t and
y= 1 - t and z = 1 - t. Those are the components of the vector equation
P = P0 + tV-which produces the line.
Here is the problem. The line needs two equations-or a vector equation with a
parameter t. Neither form is as simple as ax + by + cz = d. Some books push ahead
anyway, to give full details about both forms. After trying this approach, I believe
that those details should wait. Equations with parameters are the subject of
Chapter 12, and a line in space is the first example. Vectors and planes give plenty
to do here-especially when a vector is projected onto another vector or a plane.
PROJECTION OF A VECTOR
What is the projection of a vector B onto another vector A? One part of B goes along
A-that is the projection. The other part of B is perpendicularto A. We now compute
these two parts, which are P and B - P.

S11

Vectors and Matrices

In geometry, projections involve cos 0. In algebra, we use the dot product (which
is closely tied to cos 0). In applications, the vector B might be a velocity V or a force
F:
An airplane flies northeast, and a 100-mile per hour wind blows due
east. What is the projection of V = (100, 0) in the flight direction A?
Gravity makes a ball roll down the surface 2x + 2y + z = 0. What are
the projections of F = (0, 0, - mg) in the plane and perpendicular to
the plane?
The component of V along A is the push from the wind (tail wind). The other
component of V pushes sideways (crosswind). Similarly the force parallel to the
surface makes the ball move. Adding the two components brings back V or F.

Projections along A of wind velocity V and force F and vector B.

We now compute the projection of B onto A. Call this projection P. Since its
direction is known-P is along A-we can describe P in two ways:
1) Give the length of P along A
2) Give the vector P as a multiple of A.

Figure 11.1lb shows the projection P and its length. The hypotenuse is IBI. The
length is IPI = HBI
cos 0. The perpendicular component B - P has length IBI sin 0. The
cosine is positive for angles less than 900. The cosine (and P!) are zero when A and
B are perpendicular. IBI cos 0 is negative for angles greater than 900, and the projection points along -A (the length is IBI Icos 01). Unless the angle is 0Oor 300 or 450
or 600 or 900, we don't want to compute cosines-and we don't have to. The dot
product does it automatically:
IA|I BI cos 0 = A -B so the length of P along A is IBI cos 0 -

A'B

(4)

Notice that the length of A cancels out at the end of (4). If A is doubled, P is
unchanged. But if B is doubled, the projection is doubled.
What is the vector P? Its length along A is A . B/IAI. If A is a unit vector, then
JAl = 1 and the projection is A . B times A. Generally A is not a unit vector, until we
divide by IAI. Here is the projection P of B along A:

Question
EXAMPLE 8

When is P = 0? Answer When A and B are perpendicular.
Find the nearest point to the origin on the plane x + 2y + 2z = 5.

The shortest distancefrom the origin is along the normal vector N. The vector P to
the nearest point (Figure 11.12) is t times N, for some unknown number t. We find t
by requiring P = tN to lie on the plane.
The plane x + 2y + 2z = 5 has normal vector N = (1, 2, 2). Therefore P = tN =
(t, 2t, 2t). To lie on the plane, this must satisfy x + 2y + 2z = 5:
t+2(2t) + 2(2t) = 5 or

9t=5 or t= .

(6)

Then P = !N = (6, ,
). That locates the nearest point. The distance is INI
N = .
This example is important enough to memorize, with letters not numbers:

The steps are the same. N has components a, b, c. The nearest point on the plane is
a multiple (ta, tb, tc). It lies on the plane if a(ta) + b(tb) + c(tc) = d.
Thus t = d/(a2 + b2 + c2). The point (ta, tb, tc) = tN is in equation (7). The distance
to the plane is ItNI = Idl/INI.

Fig. 11.12 Vector to the nearest point P is a multiple tN. The distance is in (7) and (9).

Question How far is the plane from an arbitrary point Q = (xl, yl, z 1 )?
Answer The vectorfrom Q to P is our multiple tN. In vector form P = Q + tN. This
reaches the plane if P -N = d, and again we find t:
(Q + tN) N = d

yields

t = (d - Q . N)/IN12.

This new term Q N enters the distance from Q to the plane:
distance = ItNI = d - Q NI/INI = Id - ax 1 - by, - cz1 l/ a2 + b 2

When the point is on the plane, that distance is zero-because ax, + by, + czx = d.

When Q is i + 3j + 2k, the figure shows Q . N = 11 and distance = 2.
PROJECTIONS OF THE HEART VECTOR

An electrocardiogram has leads to your right arm-left arm-left leg. You produce the
voltage. The machine amplifies and records the readings. There are also six chest
leads, to add a front-back dimension that is monitored across the heart. We will
concentrate on the big "Einthoven triangle," named after the inventor of the ECG.
The graphs show voltage variations plotted against time. The first graph plots the
voltage difference between the arms. Lead II connects the left leg to the right arm.
Lead III completes the triangle, which has roughly equal sides (especially if you are
a little lopsided). So the projections are based on 600 and 1200 angles.
The heart vector V is the sum of many small vectors-all moved to the same
origin. V is the net effect of action potentials from the cells-small dipoles adding to
a single dipole. The pacemaker (S-A node) starts the impulse. The atria depolarize
to give the P wave on the graphs. This is actually a P loop of the heart vector-the

11.2 Planes and Projections

graphs only show its projections. The impulse reaches the A V node, pauses, and
moves quickly through the ventricles. This produces the QRS complex-the large
sharp movement on the graph.
The total QRS interval should not exceed 1/10 second (2i spaces on the printout).
V points first toward the right shoulder. This direction is opposite to the leads, so
the tracings go slightly down. That is the Q wave, small and negative. Then the heart
vector sweeps toward the left leg. In positions 3 and 4, its projection on lead I
(between the arms) is strongly positive. The R wave is this first upward deflection in
each lead. Closing the loop, the S wave is negative (best seen in leads I and aVR).
Question 1 How many graphs from the arms and leg are really independent?
Answer Only two! In a plane, the heart vector V has two components. If we know
two projections, we can compute the others. (The ECG does that for us.) Different
vectors show better in different projections. A mathematician would use 90" angles,
with an electrode at your throat.
Question 2 How are the voltages related? What is the aVR lead?
Answer Project the heart vector V onto the sides of the triangle:

'The lead vectors have L,- L,, + L,,, = O-they form a triangle.
'The projections have V, - V,, + V,,, = V L, - V L,, + V L,,, = 0.

J'

The aVR lead is - i L , - Qh,.
It is pure algebra (no wire . By vector addition it points
toward the electrode on the right arm. Its length is 3 if the other lengths are 2.
Including aVL and aVF to the left arm and foot, there are six leads intersecting at
equal angles. Visualize them going out from a single point (the origin in the chest).

QRS

loop

L

Fig. B Heart vector goes around the QRS loop. Projections are spikes on the ECG.

Question 3 If the heart vector is V = 2i - j, what voltage differences are recorded?
Answer The leads around the triangle have length 2. The machine projects V:

Lead I is the horizontal vector 2i. So V L, = 4.
Lead I1 is the - 60" vector i - f i j . So V L,, = 2 + fi.
Lead I11 is the - 120" vector - i - f i j . So V L,,, = - 2 + fi.
The first and third add to the second. The largest R waves are in leads I and 11. In
aVR the projection of V will be negative (Problem 46), and will be labeled an S wave.

II Vectors and Matrlces

Question 4 What about the potential (not just its differences).Is it zero at the center?
Answer It is zero ifwe say so. The potential contains an arbitrary constant C. (It is
like an indefinite integral. Its differences are like definite integrals.) Cardiologists
define a "central terminal" where the potential is zero.

The average of V over a loop is the mean heart vector H. This average requires

[ Vdt, by Chapter 5. With no time to integrate, the doctor looks for a lead where the
area under the QRS complex is zero. Then the direction of H (the axis) is perpendicular to that lead. There is so much to say about calculus in medicine.

11 Vectors and Matrices

After saying that vectors are not multiplied, we offered the dot product. Now we
contradict ourselves further, by defining the cross product. Where A B was a number,
the cross product A x B is a vector. It has length and direction:
The length is IAl IBI 1 sin 81. The direction is perpendicular to A and B.
The cross product (also called vector product) is defined in three dimensions only.
A and B lie on a plane through the origin. A x B is along the normal vector N,
perpendicular to that plane. We still have to say whether it points "up" or "down"
along N.
The length of A x B depends on sin 8, where A B involved cos 8. The dot product
rewards vectors for being parallel (cos 0 = 1). The cross product is largest when A is
perpendicular to B (sin n/2 = 1). At every angle
That will be a bridge from geometry to algebra. This section goes from definition to
formula to volume to determinant. Equations (6) and (14) are the key formulas for

Notice that A x A = 0. (This is the zero vector, not the zero number.) When B is
parallel to A, the angle is zero and the sine is zero. Parallel vectors have A x B = 0.
Perpendicular vectors have sin 8 = 1 and IA x BI = JAlIBI = area of rectangle with
sides A and B.
Here are four examples that lead to the cross product A x B.
EXAMPLE 1 (From geometry) Find the area of a parallelogram and a triangle.

Vectors A and B, going out from the origin, form two sides of a triangle. They produce
'the parallelogram in Figure 11.13, which is twice as large as the triangle.
The area of a parallelogram is base times height (perpendicular height not sloping
height). The base is [A[. The height is IBI [sin 81. We take absolute values because
height and area are not negative. Then the area is the length of the cross product:
area of parallelogram = IAl IB( [sin 81 = IA x BI.

EXAMPLE 2 (From physics) The torque vector T = R x F produces rotation.

The force F acts at the point (x, y, z). When F is parallel to the position vector R =
xi + yj + zk, the force pushes outward (no turning). When F is perpendicular to R,
the force creates rotation. For in-between angles there is an outward force IF1 cos 8
and a turning force IF1 sin 8. The turning force times the distance (RI is the moment
JRI(FIsin 8.

417

11.3 Cross Products and Determinants
The moment gives the magnitude and sign of the torque vector T = R x F. The
direction of T is along the axis of rotation, at right angles to R and F.
EXAMPLE 3

Does the cross product go up or down? Use the right-handrule.

Forces and torques are probably just fine for physicists. Those who are not natural
physicists want to see something turn.t We can visualize a record or compact disc
rotating around its axis-which comes up through the center.
At a point on the disc, you give a push. When the push is outward (hard to do),
nothing turns. Rotation comes from force "around" the axis. The disc can turn either
way-depending on the angle between force and position. A sign convention is
necessary, and it is the right-hand rule:
A x B points along your right thumb when the fingers curl from A toward B.
This rule is simplest for the vectors i, j, k in Figure 11.14-which is all we need.
Suppose the fingers curl from i to j. The thumb points along k. The x-y-z axes
form a "right-handed triple." Since li| = 1 and I|j= 1 and sin 7n/2 = 1, the length of i x j
is 1. The cross product is i x j = k. The disc turns counterclockwise-its angular
velocity is up-when the force acts at i in the direction j.
Figure 11.14b reverses i and j. The force acts at j and its direction is i. The disc
turns clockwise (the way records and compact discs actually turn). When the fingers
curl from j to i, the thumb points down. Thus j x i = - k. This is a special case of an
amazing rule:
The cross product is anticommutative: B x A = - (A x B).
(3)
That is quite remarkable. Its discovery by Hamilton produced an intellectual revolution in 19th century algebra, which had been totally accustomed to AB = BA. This
commutative law is old and boring for numbers (it is new and boring for dot products). Here we see its opposite for vector products A x B. Neither law holds for
matrix products.

A screw goes into a wall or out, following the right-hand rule.

The disc was in the xy plane. So was the force. (We are not breaking records here.)
The axis was up and down. To see the cross product more completely we need to
turn a screw into a wall.
Figure 11.14b shows the xz plane as the wall. The screw is in the y direction. By
turning from x toward z we drive the screw into the wall-which is the negative y
direction. In other words i x k equals minus j. We turn the screw clockwise to make
it go in. To take out the screw, twist from k toward i. Then k x i equals plus j.
tEverybody is a natural mathematician. That is the axiom behind this book.

Vectors and Matrices

To summarize: k x i = j and j x k = i have plus signs because kij and jki are in the
same "cyclic order" as ijk. (Anticyclic is minus.) The z-x-y and y-z-x axes form right-

handed triples like x-y-z.
THE FORMULA FOR THE CROSS PRODUCT
We begin the algebra of A x B. It is essential for computation, and it comes out
beautifully. The square roots in IAI IBI Isin 01 will disappear in formula (6) for A x B.
(The square roots also disappeared in A *B, which is IAI IBI cos 0. But IAl IBI tan 0
would be terrible.) Since A x B is a vector we need to find three components.
Start with the two-dimensional case. The vectors a, i + a2j and b, i + b2j are in the
xy plane. Their cross product must go in the z direction. Therefore A x B = ? k
and there is only one nonzero component. It must be IAI IBI sin 0 (with the correct
sign), but we want a better formula. There are two clean ways to compute A x B,
either by algebra (a) or by a bridge (b) to the dot product and geometry:
(a) (ai+a
2 b2jx
2 j) x (bi+b2j)=albixi+ab 2 ixj + a2 bjxi+a
On the right are 0, ab

2 k,

-a 2 b1 k, and 0. The cross product is (ab

(4)

- a2 b,)k.

(b) Rotate B= bli + b2j clockwise through 90o into B* = b2 i- b1j.Its length is
unchanged (and B - B* = 0). Then IAI IBI sin 0 equals IAl IB*I cos 0, which is A " B*:

IAIIBI sin = A B*=

a1 b2

2 bl.

(5)

SF In the xy plane, A x B equals (ab 2 - a2 b)k. The parallelogram with
sides A and B has area |a1
b2 - a2b 1. The triangle OAB has area -|a, b2 - a2 b 1.

EXAMPLE 5

For A = i + 2j and B = 4i + 5j the cross product is (1 5 - 2 - 4)k = - 3k.

Area of parallelogram = 3, area of triangle = 3/2. The minus sign in A x B = - 3k is

absent in the areas.
Note Splitting A x B into four separate cross products is correct, but it does not
follow easily from IAl IBI sin 0. Method (a) is not justified until Remark 1 below. An
algebraist would change the definition of A x B to start with the distributive law
(splitting rule) and the anticommutative law:
Ax(B+C)=(AxB)+(AxC)

and

AxB=-(BxA).

THE CROSS PRODUCT FORMULA (3 COMPONENTS)
We move to three dimensions. The goal is to compute all three components of A x B
(not just the length). Method (a) splits each vector into its i, j, k components, making
nine separate cross products:
(ali+ a2j + a 3k) x (bai + b2 j + b3k) = alb 2(i x i) + alb 2(i x j) + seven more terms.

Remember i x i = j x j = k x k = 0. Those three terms disappear. The other six terms
come in pairs, and please notice the cyclic pattern:

FORMULA A x B = (a2b 3 - a 3 b2)i + (a3b, - a1 b3)j + (alb2 - a2 b,)k.

(6)

The k component is the 2 x 2 answer, when a3 = b3 = 0. The i component involves
indices 2 and 3, j involves 3 and 1, k involves 1 and 2. The cross product formula is

11.3 Cross Products and Determinants

419

written as a "determinant" in equation (14) below-many people use that form to
compute A x B.
EXAMPLE6

(i+2j+3k) x (4i+5j+6k)= (2*6- 35)i+(3*4- 16)j+(1 5- 24)k.

The i, j, k components give A x B = - 3i + 6j - 3k. Never add the - 3, 6, and - 3.

Remark 1 The three-dimensional formula (6) is still to be matched with A x B from
geometry. One way is to rotate B into B* as before, staying in the plane of A and B.
Fortunately there is an easier test. The vector in equation (6) satisfies all four geometric requirements on A x B: perpendicular to A, perpendicular to B, correct length,

right-hand rule. The length is checked in Problem 16-here is the zero dot product
with A:
A (A x B)= al(a 2b3 - a3b 2)+ a2(a 3b - ab 3 )+ a 3(ab

2

- a2 b)= 0.

(7)

Remark 2 (Optional) There is a wonderful extension of the Pythagoras formula
a2 + b 2 = c2 . Instead of sides of a triangle, we go to areasof projections on the yz, xz,
and xy planes. 32 + 62 + 32 is the square of the parallelogram area in Example 6.
For triangles these areas are cut in half. Figure 11.15a shows three projected triangles of area 1. Its Pythagoras formula is (1)2 + (1)2 + (½)2 = (area of PQR) 2.
EXAMPLE 7 P = (1, 0, 0), Q = (0, 1, 0), R = (0, 0, 1)lie in a plane. Find its equation.
Ideafor any P, Q, R: Find vectors A and B in the plane. Compute the normalN = A x B.

Solution The vector from P to Q has components -1, 1, 0. It is A = j - i (subtract
to go from P to Q). Similarly the vector from P to R is B = k - i. Since A and B are
in the plane of Figure 11.15, N = A x B is perpendicular:
(j - i) x (k - i)=(j x k)- (i x k)-(j x i)+(i x i)= i+ j+ k.

(8)

The normal vector is N = i + j + k. The equation of the plane is 1x + ly + z = d.

With the right choice d = 1, this plane contains P, Q, R. The equation is x + y + z = 1.

DETERMINANTS AND VOLUMES
We are close to good algebra. The two plane vectors ali + a2j and b1i+ b2j are the
sides of a parallelogram. Its area is a1b2 - a2 bl, possibly with a sign change. There

420

is a special way to write these four numbers-in a "square matrix." There is also a
name for the combination that leads to area. It is the "determinant of the matrix":
The matrix is

a

its determinant is

b, b2

= ajb2 - a2bl.

b1 b2

This is a 2 by 2 matrix (notice brackets) and a 2 by 2 determinant (notice vertical
bars). The matrix is an array of four numbers and the determinant is one number:

The second has no area because A = B. The third is a unit square (A = i, B = j).
Now move to three dimensions, where determinants are most useful. The parallelogram becomes a parallelepiped. The word "box" is much shorter, and we will use it,
but remember that the box is squashed. (Like a rectangle squashed to a parallelogram,
the angles are generally not 900.) The three edges from the origin are A = (a,, a 2, a3 ),
B=(bl, b2 ,b 3), C=(c1 , C2,c 3). Those edges are at right angles only when A B=
A C = B*C= 0.

Question: What is the volume of the box? The right-angle case is easy-it is length

times width times height. The volume is IAI times IBI times ICI, when the angles are
90'. For a squashed box (Figure 11.15) we need the perpendicular height, not the
sloping height.
There is a beautiful formula for volume. B and C give a parallelogram in the base,
and lB x CI is the base area. This cross product points straight up. The third vector
A points up at an angle-its perpendicular height is JAl cos 0. Thus the volume is
area IB x CI times JAI times cos 0. The volume is the dot product of A with B x C.
11G

The triple scalar product is A (B x C). Volume of box = IA (B x C)I.

Important: A . (B x C) is a number, not a vector. This volume is zero when A is in

the same plane as B and C (the box is totally flattened). Then B x C is perpendicular
to A and their dot product is zero.
Usefulfacts: A (Bx C)=(Ax B)C=C (Ax B)=B.(C xA).

All those come from the same box, with different sides chosen as base-but no change
in volume. Figure 11.15 has B and C in the base but it can be A and B or A and C.
The triple product A- (C x B) has opposite sign, since C x B = - (B x C). This order

ACB is not cyclic like ABC and CAB and BCA.
To compute this triple product A . (B x C), we take B x C from equation (6):
A (B x C) = al(b 2 c3 - b 3 C2) + a 2 (b 3 c 1 - blC 3 ) + a 3 (blc 2 - b 2 Cl).

(9)

The numbers a,, a2, a3 multiply 2 by 2 determinants to give a 3 by 3 determinant!
There are three terms with plus signs (like alb 2 c3). The other three have minus signs
(like -alb 3c2). The plus terms have indices 123, 231, 312 in cyclic order. The minus
terms have anticyclic indices 132, 213, 321. Again there is a special way to write the
nine components of A, B, C-as a "3 by 3 matrix." The combination in (9), which

11.3 Cross Products and Determinants

gives volume, is a "3 by 3 determinant:"
a1 a2 a3

, determinant = A (B x C)= bl b2 b3

A single number is produced out of nine numbers, by formula (9). The nine numbers
are multiplied three at a time, as in a, blc2-except this product is not allowed. Each
row and column must be represented once. This gives the six terms in the determinant:

The trick is in the _+ signs. Products down to the right are "plus":

With practice the six products like 2 2 2 are done in your head. Write down only
8 + 1 + 1 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 4. This is the determinant and the volume.
Note the special case when the vectors are i, j, k. The box is a unit cube:
1 0 0
volume of cube = 0 1 0 =
0 0 1

1+0+0
-0-0-0

=

1.

If A, B, C lie in the same plane, the volume is zero. A zero determinant is the test
to see whether three vectors lie in a plane. Here row A = row B - row C:

Zeros in the matrix simplify the calculation. All three products with plus signsdown to the right-are zero. The only two nonzero products cancel each other.
If the three - 1's are changed to + l's, the determinant is - 2. The determinant can
be negative when all nine entries are positive! A negative determinant only means
that the rows A, B, C form a "left-handed triple." This extra information from the
sign-right-handed vs. left-handed-is free and useful, but the volume is the absolute
value.
The determinant yields the volume also in higher dimensions. In physics, four
dimensions give space-time. Ten dimensions give superstrings. Mathematics uses all
dimensions. The 64 numbers in an 8 by 8 matrix give the volume of an eightdimensional box-with 8! = 40,320 terms instead of 3! = 6. Under pressure from my
class I omit the formula.

11 Vectors and Matric@r

Question When is the point (x, y, z) on the plane through the origin containing B
and C? For the vector A = xi + yj + zk to lie in that plane, the volume A (B x C)
must be zero. The equation of the plane is determinant = zero.
Follow this example for B = j - i and C = k - i to find the plane parallel to B and C:

This equation is x + y + z = 0. The normal vector N = B x C has components 1,1,1.
THE CROSS PRODUCT AS A DETERMINANT

There is a connection between 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 determinants that you have to see.
The numbers in the top row multiply determinants from the other rows:

The highlighted product al(b2c3- b3c2) gives two of the six terms. AN six products
contain an a and b and c from diflerent columns. There are 3! = 6 different orderings
of columns 1,2, 3. Note how a3 multiplies a determinant from columns 1 and 2.
Equation (13) is identical with equations (9) and (10). We are meeting the same six
terms in different ways. The new feature is the minus sign in front of a,-and the
common mistake is to forget that sign. In a 4 by 4 determinant, a l , - a,, a3, - a,
would multiply 3 by 3 determinants.
Now comes a key step. We write A x B as a determinant. The vectors i, j, k go in
the top row, the components of A and B go in the other rows. The "determinant" is
exactly A x B:

This time we highlighted the j component with its minus sign. There is no great
mathematics in formula (14)-it is probably illegal to mix i, j, k with six numbers but
it works. This is the good way to remember and compute A x B. In the example
( j - i) x (k - i) from equation (8), those two vectors go into the last two rows:

The k component is highlighted, to see a1b2- a2bl again. Note the change from
equation (1I), which had 0,1, - 1 in the top row. That triple product was a number
(zero). This cross product is a vector i + j + k.

11.4 Matrices and Linear Equations
We are moving from geometry to algebra. Eventually we get back to calculus, where
functions are nonlinear-but linear equations come first. In Chapter 1, y = mx + b
produced a line. Two equations produce two lines. If they cross, the intersection point
solves both equations-and we want to find it.
Three equations in three variables x, y, z produce three planes. Again they go
through one point (usually). Again the problem is to find that intersection point
-which solves the three equations.
The ultimate problem is to solve n equations in n unknowns. There are n hyperplanes in n-dimensional space, which meet at the solution. We need a test to be sure
they meet. We also want the solution. These are the objectives of linear algebra, which
joins with calculus at the center of pure and applied mathematics.?
Like every subject, linear algebra requires a good notation. To state the equations
and solve them, we introduce a "matrix." The problem will be Au = d. The solution
will be u = A-'d. It remains to understand where the equations come from, where
the answer comes from, and what the matrices A and A - stand for.

TWO EQUATIONS IN TWO UNKNOWNS

Linear algebra has no reason to choose one variable as special. The equation y - yo =
m(x - xo) separates y from x. A better equation for a line is ax + by = d. (A vertical
?Linear algebra dominates some applications while calculus governs others. Both are essential.
A fuller treatment is presented in the author's book Linear Algebra and Its Applications

11 Vectors and Matrices

line like x = 5 appears when b = 0. The first form did not allow slope m = oo .) This
section studies two lines:

By solving both equations at once, we are asking (x, y) to lie on both lines. The
practical question is: Where do the lines cross? The mathematician's question is: Does
a solution exist and is it unique?
To understand everything is not possible. There are parts of life where you never
know what is going on (until too late). But two equations in two unknowns can have
no mysteries. There are three ways to write the system-by rows, by columns, and
by matrices. Please look at all three, since setting up a problem is generally harder
and more important than solving it. After that comes the concession to the real world:
we compute x and y.
How do you invest $5000 to earn $400 a year interest, if a money market
account pays 5% and a deposit account pays lo%?

EXAMPLE 1

Set up equations by rows: With x dollars at 5% the interest is .05x. With y dollars at
10% the interest is .10y. One row for principal, another row for interest:

Same equations by columns: The left side of (2) contains x times one vector plus y
times another vector. The right side is a third vector. The equation by columns is

Same equations by matrices: Look again at the left side. There are two unknowns x
and y, which go into a vector u. They are multiplied by the four numbers 1, .05, 1,
and .lo, which go into a two by two matrix A. The left side becomes a matrix times
a vector:

NOWyou see where the "rows" and "columns" came from. They are the rows and
columns of a matrix. The rows entered the separate equations (2). The columns
entered the vector equation (3). The matrix-vector multiplication Au is defined so
that all these equations are the same:
Au by rows:

column vectors)

A is the coeficient matrix. The unknown vector is u. The known vector on the right
side, with components 5000 and 400, is d. The matrix equation is Au = d.

1I.4 Matrices and Linear Equations

Fig. 11.16 Each row of Au = d gives a line. Each column gives a vector.

This notation Au = d continues to apply when there are more equations and more
unknowns. The matrix A has a row for each equation (usually m rows). It has a column
for each unknown (usually n columns). For 2 equations in 3 unknowns it is a 2 by 3
matrix (therefore rectangular). For 6 equations in 6 unknowns the matrix is 6 by 6
(therefore square). The best way to get familiar with matrices is to work with them.
Note also the pronunciation: "matrisees" and never "matrixes."
Answer to the practical question The solution is x = 2000, y = 3000. That is the
intersection point in the row picture (Figure 11.16). It is also the correct combination
in the column picture. The matrix equation checks both at once, because matrices
are multiplied by rows or by columns. The product either way is d:

Singular case In the row picture, the lines cross at the solution. But there is a case
that gives trouble. When the lines areparallel, they never cross and there is no solution.
When the lines are the same, there is an infinity of solutions:
parallel lines

2x+y=O
2x+y=1

same line

2x+ y = o
4x+2y=O

(5)

This trouble also appears in the column picture. The columns are vectors a and b.
The equation Au = d is the same as xa + yb = d. We are asked to find the combination
of a and b (with coefficients x and y) that produces d. In the singular case a and b lie
along the same line (Figure 11.17). No combination can produce d, unless it happens
to lie on this line.

The crossing point is (1, 1) in the row picture. The solution is x = 1, y = 1 in the
column picture (Figure 11.17b). Then 1 times a plus 1 times b equals the right side d.
SOLUTION BY DETERMINANTS

Up to now we just wrote down the answer. The real problem is to find x and y when
they are unknown. We solve two equations with letters not numbers:
a x + b y = d,
a2 x + b2y= d2.

The key is to eliminate x. Multiply the first equation by a2 and the second equation
by a,. Subtract the first from the second and the x's disappear:
(ab

2

- a 2 bl)y = (ad

2

- a2 d,).

To eliminate y, subtract b, times the second equation from b2 times the first:
(b2 al - b a2 )x = (b2 d, - bid 2 ).
What you see in those parentheses are 2 by 2 determinants! Remember from
Section 11.3:

This number appears on the left side of (6) and (7). The right side of (7) is also a
determinant-but it has d's in place of a's. The right side of (6) has d's in place of
b's. So x and y are ratios of determinants, given by Cramer's Rule:

Cramer's Rule has x = 100/.05 = 2000 and y = 150/.05 = 3000. This is the solution.
The singular case is when the determinant of A is zero-and we can't divide by it.
111 Cramer's Rule breaks down when det A = 0-which is the singular case.
Then the lines in the row picture are parallel, and one column is a multiple of
the other column.

+ y = 0, 2x + y = 1 are parallel. The determinant is zero:

The lines in Figure 11.17a don't meet. Notice the columns: I:[ is a multiple of [:I.
One final comment on 2 by 2 systems. They are small enough so that all solution
methods apply. Cramer's Rule uses determinants. Larger systems use elimination
(3 by 3 matrices are on the borderline). A third solution (the same solution!) comes
from the inverse matrix A - ' , to be described next. But the inverse is more a symbol
for the answer than a new way of computing it, because to find A-' we still use
determinants or elimination.
THE INVERSE OF A MATRIX

The symbol A-' is pronounced "A inverse." It stands for a matrix-the one that
solves Au = d . I think of A as a matrix that takes u to d. Then A-' is a matrix that
takes d back to u. If Au = d then u = A - 'd (provided the inverse exists). This is exactly
like functions and inverse functions: g(x) = y and x = gP'(y). Our goal is to find A when we know A.
The first approach will be very direct. Cramer's Rule gave formulas for x and y,
the components of u. From that rule we can read off A - ' , assuming that D =
a , b2 - a2bl is not zero. D is det A and we divide by it:

'

The matrix on the right (including 1/D in all four entries) is A-'. Notice the sign
pattern and the subscript pattern. The inverse exists if D is not zero-this is important. Then the solution comes from a matrix-vector multiplication, A-' times d. We
repeat the rules for that multiplication:
DEFINITION A matrix M times a vector v equals a vector of dot products:

row 2
Equatioin (8) follows this rule with M = A-' and v = d. Look at Example 1:

There st,ands the inverse matrix. It multiplies d to give the solution u:

The formulas work perfectly, but you have to see a direct way to reach A - Id. Multiply
both sides of Au = d by A - ' . The multiplication "cancels" A on the left side, and
leaves u = A-'d. This approach comes next.

430

11 Vectors and Matrices
MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
To understand the power of matrices, we must multiply them. The product of A- 1
with Au is a matrix times a vector. But that multiplication can be done another way.
First A-' multiplies A, a matrix times a matrix. The product A -'A is another matrix
(a very special matrix). Then this new matrix multiplies u.
The matrix-matrix rule comes directly from the matrix-vector rule. Effectively, a
vector v is a matrix V with only one column. When there are more columns, M times
V splits into separate matrix-vector multiplications, side by side:
A matrix M times a matrix V equals a matrix of dot products:

The next section moves to three equations. The algebra gets more complicated (and

gives A - 1Au = A - 'd-and the left side is Iu = u.

Dodgson-better known to the world as Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in
Wonderland. I regret to say that he preferred his own notation
instead of aij.

PROJECTION ONTO A PLANE = LEAST SQUARES FllllNG BY A LINE

We close with a genuine application. It starts with three-dimensional vectors a, b, d
and leads to a 2 by 2 system. One good feature: a, b, d can be n-dimensional with no
change in the algebra. In practice that happens. Second good feature: There is a
calculus problem in the background. The example is tofit points by a straight line.
There are three ways to state the problem, and they look different:

+

1. Solve xa yb = d as well as possible (three equations, two unknowns x and y).
2. Project the vector d onto the plane of the vectors a and b.
3. Finld the closest straight line ("least squares") to three given points.
Figure 11.19 shows a three-dimensional vector d above the plane of a and b. Its
projection onto the plane is p = xa + yb. The numbers x and y are unknown, and
our goal is to find them. The calculation will use the dot product, which is always
the key to right angles.
The diflerence d - p is the "error." There has to be an error, because no combination
of a and b can produce d exactly. (Otherwise d is in the plane.) The projection p is
the closest point to d, and it is governed by one fundamental law: The error is
perpendicular to the plane. That makes the error perpendicular to both vectors a
and b:
(13)
a*(xa+yb-d)=O
and
b-(xa+yb-d)=O.

11 Vectors and Matrices

Rewrite those as two equations for the two unknown numbers x and y:
(a a)x + (a b)y = a d
(14)

(b a)x + (b b)y = b d.
These are the famous normal equations in statistics, to compute x and y and p.

EXAMPLE 7 For a = (1, 1, 1) and b = (l,2, 3) and d = (0, 5,4), solve equation (14):

3x+ 6y= 9
6x + 14y = 22

gives

x = -1
y=

2

SO

p = -a

+ 2b = (1, 3,5) = projection.

Notice the three equations that we are not solving (we can't): xa + yb = d is
x + y=O
x

+ 2y = 5

with the 3 by 2 matrix A

=

x+3y=4
For d = (0, 5,4) there is no solution; d is not in the plane of a and b. For p = (1,3, 5)
there is a solution, x = - 1 and y = 2. The vector p is in the plane. The error d - p
is (- 1,2, - 1). This error is perpendicular to the columns (1, 1, 1) and (l,2, 3), so it is
perpendicular to their plane.
SAME EXAMPLE (written as a line-fitting problem) Fit the points (1,O) and (2, 5) and
(3,4) as closely as possible ("least squares") by a straight line.

+

Two points determine a line. The example asks the linef = x yt to go through three
points. That gives the three equations in (IS), which can't be solved with two unknowns. We have to settle for the closest line, drawn in Figure 11.19b. This line is
computed again below, by calculus.
Notice that the closest line has heights 1, 3, 5 where the data points have heights
0,5,4. Those are the numbers in p and d! The heights 1 , 3 , 5 fit onto a line; the heights
0, 5 , 4 do not. In the first figure, p = (1, 3, 5) is in the plane and d = (0, 5,4) is not.
Vectors in the plane lead to heights that lie on a line.
Notice another coincidence. The coefficients x = - 1 and y = 2 give the projection
- a 2b. They also give the closest line f = - 1 + 2t. All numbers appear in both
figures.

Fig. 11.19 Projection onto plane is (1, 3, 5) with coefficients -1, 2. Closest line has heights
1, 3, 5 with coefficients -1, 2. Error in both pictures is -1, 2, -1.

433

11.4 Matrices and Linear Equations
Remark Finding the closest line is a calculus problem: Minimize a sum of squares.
The numbers x and y that minimize E give the least squares solution:
E(x, y) = (x + y - 0)2 + (x + 2y - 5)2 + (x + 3y - 4)2 .

(16)

Those are the three errors in equation (15), squared and added. They are also the
three errors in the straight line fit, between the line and the data points. The projection
minimizes the error (by geometry), the normal equations (14) minimize the error (by
algebra), and now calculus minimizes the error by setting the derivatives of E to zero.
The new feature is this: E depends on two variables x and y. Therefore E has two
derivatives. They both have to be zero at the minimum. That gives two equations for
x and y:
x derivative of E is zero: 2(x + y) + 2(x + 2y - 5)

+ 2(x + 3y - 4)

=0

y derivative of E is zero: 2(x + y) + 2(x + 2y - 5)(2) + 2(x + 3y - 4)(3) = 0.
When we divide by 2, those are the normal equations 3x + 6y = 9 and 6x + 14y =
22. The minimizing x and y from calculus are the same numbers -1 and 2.
The x derivative treats y as a constant. The y derivative treats x as a constant.
These are partialderivatives. This calculus approach to least squares is in Chapter 13,
as an important application of partial derivatives.
We now summarize the least squares problem-to find the closest line to n data
points. In practice n may be 1000 instead of 3. The points have horizontal coordinates
bl, b2 , ... , b,. The vertical coordinates are dl, d 2 , ... , d.. These vectors b and d,
together with a = (1, 1, ... , 1), determine a projection-the combination p = xa + yb
that is closest to d. This problem is the same in n dimensions-the error d - p is
perpendicular to a and b. That is still tested by dot products, p a = d a and p b =
d - b, which give the normal equations for x and y:
(a . a)x + (a . b)y = a . d
(b . a)x + (b " b)y = b . d

(n) x + (Xbi)y =
=di
(17)

(Eb,)x + (Ibý)y = Ebid,.

44K The least squares problem projects d onto the plane of a and b. The
projection is p = xa + yb, i n dimensions. The closest line is f = x + t, in two
dimensions. The normal equations (17) give the best x and y.

11.5 Linear Algebra
This section moves from two to three dimensions. There are three unknowns x, y, z
and also three equations. This is a t the crossover point between formulas and
algorithms-it is real linear algebra. The formulas give a direct solution using determinants. The algorithms use elimination and the numbers x, y, z appear at the
end. In practice that end result comes quickly. Computers solve linear equations by
elimination.
The situation for a nonlinear equation is similar. Quadratic equations
ax2 bx c = 0 are solved by a formula. Cubic equations are solved by Newton's
method (even though a formula exists). For equations involving x or x lo, algorithms
take over completely.
Since we are at the crossover point, we look both ways. This section has a lot to
do, in mixing geometry, determinants, and 3 by 3 matrices:

1. The row picture: three planes intersect at the solution
2. The column picture: a vector equation combines the columns
3. The formulas: determinants and Cramer's Rule
4. Matrix multiplication and A - '
5. The algorithm: Gaussian elimination.
Part of our goal is three-dimensional calculus. Another part is n-dimensional algebra.
And a third possibility is that you may not take mathematics next year. If that

happens, I hope you will use mathematics. Linear equations are so basic and important, in such a variety of applications, that the effort in this section is worth making.
An example is needed. It is convenient and realistic if the matrix contains zeros.
Most equations in practice are fairly simple-a thousand equations each with 990
zeros would be very reasonable. Here are three equations in three unknowns:

The goal is to understand that system geometrically, and then solve it.
THE ROW PICTURE: INTERSECTING PLANES

Start with the first equation x + y = 1. In the xy plane that produces a line. In three
dimensions it is a plane. It has the usual form ax + by + cz = d, except that c happens
to be zero. The plane is easy to visualize (Figure 11.20a), because it cuts straight down
through the line. The equation x + y = 1 allows z to have any value, so the graph
includes all points above and below the line.
The second equation x + 2z = 0 gives a second plane, which goes through the
origin. When the right side is zero, the point (0, 0, 0) satisfies the equation. This time y

is absent from the equation, so the plane contains the whole y axis. All points (0, y, 0)
meet the requirement x + 2z = 0. The normal vector to the plane is N = i + 2k. The

plane cuts across, rather than down, in 11.20b.
Before the third equation we combine the first two. The intersection of two planes
is a line. In three-dimensional space, two equations (not one) describe a line. The
points on the line have to satisfy x + y = 1 and also x + 2z = 0. A convenient point
is P = (0, 1, 0). Another point is Q = (-1, 2, -). The line through P and Q extends out
in both directions.
The solution is on that line. The third plane decides where.

11.5 Linear Algebra

The third equation - 2y + 22 = - 4 gives the third plane-which misses the origin
because the right side is not zero. What is important is the point where the three
planes meet. The intersection line of the first two planes crosses the third plane.
We used determinants (but elimination is better) to find x = - 2, y = 3, z = 1. This
solution satisfies the three equations and lies on the three planes.
A brief comment on 4 by 4 systems. The first equation might be x + y + z - t = 0.
It represents a three-dimensional "hyperplane" in four-dimensional space. (In physics
this is space-time.) The second equation gives a second hyperplane, and its intersection
with the first one is two-dimensional. The third equation (third hyperplane) reduces
the intersection to a line. The fourth hyperplane meets that line at a point, which is
the solution. It satisfies the four equations and lies on the four hyperplanes. In this
course three dimensions are enough.
COLUMN PICTURE: COMBINATION OF COLUMN VECTORS

There is an extremely important way to rewrite our three equations. In (1) they were
separate, in (2) they went into a matrix. Now they become a vector equation:

The columns of the matrix are multiplied by x, y, z. That is a special way to see matrixvector multiplication: Au is a combination of the columns of A. We are looking for
the numbers x, y, z so that the combination produces the right side d.
The column vectors a, b, c are shown in Figure 11.21a. The vector equation is
xa + yb + zc = d. The combination that solves this equation must again be x = - 2,
y = 3, z = 1. That agrees with the intersection point of the three planes in the row
picture.

THE DETERMINANT AND THE INVERSE MATRIX

For a 3 by 3 determinant, the section on cross products gave two formulas. One was
the triple product a (b x c). The other wrote out the six terms:
det A = a (b x c) = al(b2c3- b3c2)+ a2(b3c,- blc3) + a3(b,cz - b2cl).

II

Vectors and Matrices

Geometrically this is the volume of a box. The columns a, b, c are the edges going out
from the origin. In our example the determinant and volume are 2:

A slight dishonesty is present in that calculation, and will be admitted now. In
Section 11.3 the vectors A, B, C were rows. In this section a, b, c are columns. It doesn't
matter, because the determinant is the same either way. Any matrix can be
"transposedw-exchanging rows for columns-without altering the determinant. The
six terms (alb2c3is the first) may come in a different order, but they are the same six
terms. Here four of those terms are zero, because of the zeros in the matrix. The sum
of all six terms is D = det A = 2.
Since D is not zero, the equations can be solved. The three planes meet at a point.
The column vectors a, b, c produce a genuine box, and are not flattened into the same
plane (with zero volume). The solution involves dividing by D-which is only possible
if D = det A is not zero.

I

14L When the determinant D is not zero, A bas an inverse: AA-' = A-'A =
I. Then the equations Au = d have one and only one solution u = A - 'd.

I

The 3 by 3 identity matrix I is at the end of equation (5). Always Iu = u.
We now compute A-', first with letters and then with numbers. The neatest
formula uses cross products of the columns of A-it is special for 3 by 3 matrices.

'

-1

Every entry is divided by D: The inverse matrix is A- -

D

rbxc i

I.

(4)

To test this formula, multiply by A. Matrix multiplication produces a matrix of dot
products-from the rows of the first matrix and the columns of the second, A- 'A = I:
a m ( b x c )be(bxc) ca(bxc)

1 0 0

ae(cxa) be(cxa) cg(cxa)

D
axb

a m ( a xb) b 0 ( a xb) c m ( a xb)

On the right side, six of the triple products are zero. They are the off-diagonals like
b (b x c), which contain the same vector twice. Since b x c is perpendicular to b, this
triple product is zero. The same is true of the others, like a (a x b) = 0. That is the
volume of a box with two identical sides. The six off-diagonal zeros are the volumes
of completely flattened boxes.
On the main diagonal the triple products equal D. The order of vectors can be abc
or bca or cab, and the volume of the box stays the same. Dividing by this number D,
which is placed outside for that purpose, gives the 1's in the identity matrix I.
Now we change to numbers. The goal is to find A-' and to test it.

11.5 Llnear Algebra

That comes from the formula, and it absolutely has to be checked. Do not fail to
multiply A-' times A (or A times A- '). Matrix multiplication is much easier than
the formula for A-'. We highlight row 3 times column 1, with dot product zero:

'

Inverting a matrix requires D # 0. We divide by D = det A. The
Remark on Across products b x c and c x a and a x b give A-' in a neat form, but errors are
easy. We prefer to avoid writing i, j, k. There are nine 2 by 2 determinants to be
calculated, and here is A-' in full-containing the nine "cofcretors~'divided by D:

Important: The first row of A-' does not use the first column of A, except in 1/D.
In other words, b x c does not involve a. Here are the 2 by 2 determinants that
produce 4, - 2, 2-which is divided by D = 2 in the top row of A-':

The second highlighted determinant looks like + 2 not -2. But the sign matrix on
the right assigns a minus to that position in A-'. We reverse the sign of blc3 - b3cl,
to find the cofactor b3c1 - blc3 in the top row of (6).
To repeat: For a row of A-I, cross out the corresponding column of A. Find the three
2 by 2 determinants, use the sign matrix, and divide by D.

:

The multiplication BB-I = I checks the arithmetic. Notice how
in B leads to a
zero in the top row of B-'. To find row 1, column 3 of B-' we ignore column 1 and
row 3 of B. (Also: the inverse of a triangular matrix is triangular.) The minus signs
come from the sign matrix.
THE SOLUTION u = A- 'd

The purpose of A-' is to solve the equation Au = d. Multiplying by A-' produces
Iu = A-'d. The matrix becomes the identity, Iu equals u, and the solution is
immediate:

11 Vectors and Matrices

By writing those components x, y, z as ratios ofdeterminants, we have Cramer's Rule:

The solution is x = -Id
- b cl y=- la d cl z=- la b 4
la b cl'
}a b cl'
la b el'

(10)

The right side d replaces, in turn, columns a and b and c. All denominators are D =
a (b x c). The numerator of x is the determinant d (b x c) in (9). The second numerator agrees with the second component d (c x a), because the cyclic order is correct.
The third determinant with columns abd equals the triple product d (a x b) in A - 'u.
Thus (10) is the same as (9).
EXAMPLE A:

Multiply by A-' to find the known solution x =

EXAMPLE B:

Multiply by B-' to solve Bu = d when d is the column (6, 5, 4):

"=

2, y = 3, z

1:

B-'d=

EXAMPLE C: Put d = (6, 5,4) in each column of B. Cramer's Rule gives u = (1, 1,4):

This rule fills the page with determinants. Those are good ones to check by eye,
without writing down the six terms (three + and three -).
The formulas for A-' are honored chiefly in their absence. They are not used by
the computer, even though the algebra is in some ways beautiful. In big calculations,
the computer never finds A - '-just the solution.
We now look at the singular case D = 0. Geometry-algebra-algorithm must all
break down. After that is the algorithm: Gaussian elimination.
THE SINGULAR CASE

Changing one entry of a matrix can make the determinant zero. The triple product
a *(bx c), which is also the volume, becomes D = 0. The box is flattened and the
matrix is singular. That happens in our example when the lower right entry is changed
from 2 to 4:

1

S= 1

0

2

I has determinant

D = 0.

11.5 Linear Algebra

This does more than change the inverse. It destroys the inverse. We can no longer
divide by D. There is no S - '.
What happens to the row picture and column picture? For 2 by 2 systems, the
singular case had two parallel lines. Now the row picture has three planes, which
need not be parallel. Here the planes are not parallel. Their normal vectors are the
rows of S, which go in different directions. But somehow the planes fail to go through
a common point.
What happens is more subtle. The intersection line from two planes misses the
third plane. The line is parallel to the plane and stays above it (Figure 11.22a). When
all three planes are drawn, they form an open tunnel. The picture tells more than the
numbers, about how three planes can fail to meet. The third figure shows an end
view, where the planes go directly into the page. Each pair meets in a line, but those
lines don't meet in a point.

Fig. 11.22 The row picture in the singular case: no intersection point, no solution.

When two planes are parallel, the determinant is again zero. One row of the matrix
is a multiple of another row. The extreme case has all three planes parallel-as in a
matrix with nine 1's.
The column picture must also break down. In the 2 by 2 failure (previous section),
the columns were on the same line. Now the three columns are in the same plane. The
combinations of those columns produce d only if it happens to lie in that particular
plane. Most vectors d will be outside the plane, so most singular systems have no
solution.
When the determinant is zero, Au = d has no solution or infinitely many.
THE ELIMINATION ALGORITHM

Go back to the 3 by 3 example Au = d. If you were given those equations, you would
never think of determinants. You would-quite correctly-start with the first equation. It gives x = 1 - y, which goes into the next equation to eliminate x:

Stop there for a minute. On the right is a 2 by 2 system for y and z . The first equation
and first unknown are eliminated-exactly what we want. But that step was not
organized in the best way, because a "1" ended up on the left side. Constants should
stay on the right side-the pattern should be preserved. It is better to take the same

11 Vectors and Matrices

step by subtracting the fist equation from the second:

Same equations, better organization. Now look at the corner term -y. Its coefficient
-1 is the secondpivot. (The first pivot was + 1, the coefficient of x in the first corner.)
We are ready for the next elimination step:
Plan: Subtract a multiple of the "pivot equation" from the equation below it.
Goal: To produce a zero below the pivot, so y is eliminated.
Method: Subtract 2 times the pivot equation to cancel - 2y.

The answer comes by back substitution. Equation (12) gives z = 1. Then equation (11)
gives y = 3. Then the first equation gives x = - 2. This is much quicker than determinants. You may ask: Why use Cramer's Rule? Good question.
With numbers elimination is better. It is faster and also safer. (To check against
error, substitute -2, 3, 1 into the original equations.) The algorithm reaches the
answer without the determinant and without the inverse. Calculations with letters use
det A and A - '.
Here are the steps in a definite order (top to bottom):
Subtract a multiple of equation 1 to produce Ox in equation 2
Subtract a multiple of equation 1 to produce Ox in equation 3
Subtract a multiple of equation 2 (new) to produce Oy in equation 3.
EXAMPLE (notice the zeros appearing under the pivots):

Elimination leads to a triangular system. The coefficients below the diagonal are zero.
First z = 2, then y = 1, then x = - 2. Back substitution solves triangular systems (fast).
As a final example, try the singular case Su = d when the corner entry is changed
from 2 to 4. With D = 0, there is no inverse matrix S - l . Elimination also fails, by
reaching an impossible equation 0 = - 2:

The three planes do not meet at a point-a fact that was not obvious at the start.
Algebra discovers this fact from D = 0. Elimination discovers it from 0 = -2. The
chapter is ending at the point where my linear algebra book begins.

11.5 Linear Algebra

One final comment. In actual computing, you will use a code written by professionals. The steps will be the same as above. A multiple of equation 1 is subtracted from
each equation below it, to eliminate the first unknown x. With one fewer unknown
and equation, elimination starts again. (A parallel computer executes many steps at
once.) Extra instructions are included to reduce roundoff error. You only see the
result! Hut it is more satisfying to know what the computer is doing.
In the end, solving linear equations is the key step in solving nonlinear equations.
The central idea of differential calculus is to linearize near a point.

12.1 The Position Vector
,-I

This chapter is about "vector functions." The vector 2i + 4j + 8k is constant. The
vector R(t) = ti + t2j+ t3k is moving. It is a function of the parameter t, which often
represents time. At each time t, the position vector R(t) locates the moving body:
position vector = R(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k.

(1)

Our example has x = t, y = t2, z = t3. As t varies, these points trace out a curve in
space. The parameter t tells when the body passes each point on the curve. The
constant vector 2i 4j 8k is the position vector R(2) at the instant t = 2.

+ +

What are the questions to be asked? Every student of calculus knows the first
question: Find the deriuatiue. If something moves, the Navy salutes it and we differentiate it. At each instant, the body moving along the curve has a speed and a direction.
This information is contained in another vector function-the velocity vector v(t)
which is the derivative of R(t):

Since i, j, k are fixed vectors, their derivatives are zero. In polar coordinates i and j
are replaced by moving vectors. Then the velocity v has more terms from the product
rule (Section 12.4).
Two important cases are uniform motion along a line and around a circle. We study
those motions in detail (v = constant on line, v = tangent to circle). This section also
finds the speed and distance and acceleration for any motion R(t).
Equation (2) is the computing rulefor the velocity dR/dt. It is not the definition of
dR/dt, which goes back to basics and does not depend on coordinates:
dRAR

+ At) - R(t)
At

We repeat: R is a vector so AR is a vector so dR/dt is a vector. All three vectors are
in Figure 12.1 (t is not a vector!). This figure reveals the key fact about the geometry:
The velocity v = dR/dt is tangent to the curve.

12.1 The PosMon Vector

The vector AR goes from one point on the curve to a nearby point. Dividing by
At changes its length, not its direction. That direction lines up with the tangent to
the curve, as the points come closer.
EXAMPLE I R(t) = ti + t2j + t3k

v(t) = i + 2tj + 3t2k

This curve swings upward as t increases. When t = 0 the velocity is v = i. The tangent
is along the x axis, since the j and k components are zero. When t = 1 the velocity is
i + 2j + 3k, and the curve is climbing.
For the shadow on the xy plane, drop the k component. Position on the shadow
is ti t2j. Velocity along the shadow is i + 2tj. The shadow is a plane curve.

Fig. 12.2 Equations of a line, with and
without the parameter t.

EXAMPLE 2 Uniform motion in a straight line: the velocity vector v is constant.

The speed and direction don't change. The position vector moves with dR/dt = v:
R(t) = R,

+ tv

(R, fixed, v fixed, t varying)

(3)
That is the equation of a line in vector form. Certainly dR/dt = v. The starting point
R, = x,i + yd + zok is given. The velocity v = v1 i v2j v3k is also given. Separating
the x, y and z components, equation (3) for a line is

+ +

line with parameter: x = xo + tul , y = yo + tv,, z = z, + tv, .
(4)
The speed along the line is ivl=.-/,
The direction of the line is the unit
vector v/lvl. We have three equations for x, y, z, and eliminating t leaves two equations.
The parameter t equals (x -xo)/vl from equation (4). It also equals (y -y0)/v2and
(z -zO)iv3.SOthese ratios equal each other, and t is gone:

x-xo

(5)
v3

An example is x = y/2 = z/3. In this case (x,, yo, z,) = (0, 0, 0)-the line goes through
the origin. Another point on the line is (x, y, z) = ( 2 , 4 6). Because t is gone, we cannot
say when we reach that point and how fast we are going. The equations x/4 = y/8 =
2/12 give the same line. Without t we can't know the velocity v = dR/dt.
EXAMPLE 3 Find an equation for the line through P = (0,2, 1) and Q = (1,3,3).

Solution We have choices! R, can go to any point on the line. The velocity v can
be any multiple of the vector from P to Q. The decision on R, controls where we
start, and v controls our speed.
The vector from P to Q is i j + 2k. Those numbers 1,1,2 come from subtracting
0,2, 1 from 1,3,3. We choose this vector i j 2k as a first v, and double it for a

+

++

12 Motion Along a Curve

second v. We choose the vector R, = P as a first start and R, = Q as a second start.
Here are two different expressions for the same line-they are P + tv and Q + t(2v):
The vector R(t) gives x = t, y = 2 + t, z = 1 + 2t. The vector R* is at a different point
on the same line at the same time: x* = 1 + 2t, y* = 3 + 2t, z* = 3 + 4t.
If I pick t = 1 in R and t = 0 in R*, the point is (1,3,3). We arrive there at different
times. You are seeing how parameters work, to tell "where" and also "when." If t
goes from - GO to + GO,all points on one line are also on the other line. The path is
the same, but the "twins" are going at different speeds.
Question 1 When d o these twins meet? When does R(t) = R*(t)?
Answer They meet at t = - 1, when R = R* = - i + j - k.
Question 2 What is an equation for the segment between P and Q (not beyond)?
Answer In the equation for R(t), let t go from 0 to 1 (not beyond):

x = t y = 2 + t z = 1 + 2t

[0 < t < 1 for segment].

(6)

At t = 0 we start from P = (0,2, 1). At t = 1 we reach Q = (1, 3, 3).
Question 3 What is an equation for the line without the parameter t?
Answer Solve equations (6) for t or use (5): x / l = (y - 2)/1 = (z - 1)/2.
Question 4 Which point on the line is closest to the origin?
Answer The derivative of x2 + y 2 + z2 = t2 + (2 + t)2 + (1 + 2t)2 is 8 + 8t. This derivative is zero at t = - I. So the closest point is (- 1, 1, - 1).

+

Question 5 Where does the line meet the plane x y + z = 1I?
Answer Equation (6) gives x + y + z = 3 + 4t = 11. So t = 2. The meeting point is
x=t=2, y=t+2=4,z=l+2t=5.
Question 6 What line goes through (3, 1, 1)perpendicular to the plane x - y - z = 1?
Answer The normal vector to the plane is N = i - j - k. That is v. The position
vector to (3, 1, 1) is R, = 3i j k. Then R = R, + tv.

+ +

COMPARING LINES AND PLANES

A line has one parameter or two equations. We give the starting point and velocity:
(x, y, z) = (x,, yo, z, ) + t(v, , v2, v,). That tells directly which points are on the line.
O r we eliminate t to find the two equations in (5).
A plane has one equation or two parameters! The equation is ax + by + cz = d.
That tells us indirectly which points are on the plane. (Instead of knowing x, y, z, we
know the equation they satisfy. Instead of directions v and w in the plane, we are
told the perpendicular direction N =(a, b, c).) With parameters, the line contains
R, + tv and the plane contains R, + tv + sw. A plane looks worse with parameters
(t and s), a line looks better.
Questions 5 and 6 connected lines to planes. Here are two more. See Problems
4 1-44:

+

Question 7 When is the line R, tv parallel to the plane? When is it perpendicular?
Answer The test is v N = 0. The test is v x N = 0.
EXAMPLE 4 Find the plane containing Po = ( I , 2, 1) and the line of points
(1,0,0) + t(2,0, - 1). That vector v will be in the plane.

12.1 The Position Vector

Solution The vector v = 2i - k goes along the line. The vector w = 2j
(1,0,O) to (1,2, 1). Their cross product is

+ k goes from

The plane 2x - 2y + 42 = 2 has this normal N and contains the point (1,2,1).
SPEED, DIRECTION, DISIANCE, ACCELERATION

We go back to the curve traced out by R(t). The derivative v(t) = dR/dt is the velocity
vector along that curve. The speed is the magnitude of v:

+ (dyldt)' + (dzldt)'.

speed = Ivl= J(dx/dt)'

(7)

The direction of the velocity vector is v/lvl. This is a unit vector, since v is divided by
its length. The unit tangent vector v/lvl is denoted by T.
The tangent vector is constant for lines. It changes direction for curves.
EXAMPLE 5 (important) Find v and (v(and T for steady motion around a circle:

x = r cos a t , y = r sin a t , z = 0.
Solution The position vector is R = r cos wt i + r sin wt j. The velocity is

v = dR/dt = - wr sin wt i + wr cos wt j (tangent, not unit tangent)
The speed is the radius r times the angular velocity w:

~ v l =,/(-or

sin cot)'

+ (wr cos wt12 = wr.

The unit tangent vector is v divided by Ivl:
T = -sin wt i+cos wt j

(length 1 since sin2wt + cos2wt = 1).

Think next about the distance traveled. Distance along a curve is always denoted
by s (called arc length). I don't know why we use s-certainly not as the initial for
speed. In fact speed is distance divided by time. The ratio s/t gives average speed;
dsldt is instantaneous speed. We are back to Chapter 1 and Section 8.3, the relation
of speed to distance:
speed lv( = dsldt

distance s = 1(dsldt) dt = 1lv(t)l dt.

Notice that (vl and s and t are scalars. The direction vector is T:

v dR/dt dR
T=-=---- unit tangent vector.
Ivl dsldt ds
In Figure 12.3, the chord length (straight) is (ARI. The arc length (curved) is As. As
AR and As approach zero, the ratio JAR/Aslapproaches (TI= 1.
Think finally about the acceleration vector a(t). It is the rate of change of velocity
(not the rate of change of speed):

Fig. 12.3 Steady motion around a circle. Half turn up a helix.

For steady motion along a line, as in x = t, y = 2 + t, z = 1 + 2t, there is no acceleration. The second derivatives are all zero. For steady motion around a circle, there is
acceleration. In driving a car, you accelerate with the gas pedal or the brake. You
also accelerate by turning the wheel. It is the velocity vector that changes, nat the
speed.
EXAMPLE 6 Find the distance s(t) and acceleration a(t) for circular motion.

Solution The speed in Example 5 is dsldt = or. After integrating, the distance is s =
art. At time t we have gone through an angle of cut. The radius is r, so the distance
traveled agrees with ot times r. Note that the dimension of w is l/time. (Angles are
dimensionless.) At time t = 2n/w we have gone once around the circle-to s = 2nr
not back to s = 0.
The acceleration is a = d2R/dt2.Remember R = r cos wt i r sin a t j:

+

a(t) = -w2r cos wt i - w2r sin wt j.

(10)

That direction is opposite to R. This is a special motion, with no action on the gas
pedal or the brake. All the acceleration is from turning. The magnitude is la1 = w2r,
with the correct dimension of distance/(timeJ2.

EXAMPLE 8 Find v and s and a around the ellipse x = cos t, y = 2 sin t, z = 0.

Solution Take derivatives: v = - sin t i + 2 cos t j and lv( = Jsin2t + 4 cos2t. This is
the speed dsldt. For the distance s, something bad happens (or something normal).
The speed is not simplified by sin2t+ cos2t = 1. We cannot integrate dsldt to find a
formula for s. The square root defeats us.
The acceleration - cos t i - 2 sin t j still points to the center. This is not the Earth

Suppose we know the acceleration a(t) and the initial velocity vo and position Ro.
Then v(t) and R(t) are also known. We integrate each component:
a(t) = constant : v(t) = vo + at

R(t) = Ro + vt + -at 2

-

a(t) = cos t k = v(t) = v 0 + sin t k= R(t) = R0 + Vot - cos t k.
THE CURVE OF A BASEBALL
There is a nice discussion of curve balls in the calculus book by Edwards and Penney.
We summarize it here (optionally). The ball leaves the pitcher's hand five feet off the
ground: Ro = Oi + Oj + 5k. The initial velocity is vo = 120i - 2j + 2k (120 ft/sec is more
than 80 miles per hour). The acceleration is - 32k from gravity, plus a new term from
spin. If the spin is around the z axis, and the ball goes along the x axis, then this
acceleration is in the y direction. (It comes from the cross product k x i-there is a
pressure difference on the sides of the ball.) A good pitcher can achieve a = 16j - 32k.
The batter integrates as fast as he can:
v(t) = vo + at = 120i + (-2 + 16t)j + (2 - 32t)k
R(t) = Ro + vot + ½at 2 = 120t i + (-2t + 8t 2 )j + (5 + 2t - 16t 2)k.
Notice the t2 . The effect of spin is small at first, then suddenly bigger (as every batter
knows). So is the effect of gravity-the ball starts to dive. At t = -, the i component
is 60 feet and the ball reaches the batter. The j component is 1 foot and the k
component is 2 feet-the curve goes low over the outside corner.
At t = 1, when the batter saw the ball halfway, the j component was zero. It looked
as if it was coming right over the plate.

and y (up). A projectile moves as t changes, so we look for x(t) and y(t). We are
shooting a basketball o r firing a gun or peacefully watering the lawn, and we have
to aim in the right direction (not directly a t the target). If the hose delivers water at
10 meters/second, can you reach the car 12 meters away?

12 Motion Along a Curve

The usual initial position is (0,O). Some flights start higher, at (0, h). The initial
velocity is (v, cos a, v, sin a), where v, is the speed and a is the angle with the
horizontal. The acceleration from gravity is purely vertical: d 2y/dt2= - g. SO the
horizontal velocity stays at its initial value. The upward velocity decreases by -gt:
dxldt = v, cos a, dyldt = vo sin a - gt.
The horizontal distance x(t) is steadily increasing. The height y(t) increases and then
decreases. To find the position, integrate the velocities (for a high start add h to y):

The projectile path is x(t) = (v, cos a)t, y(t) = (vo sin a)t - igt2.

(1)

+ +

This path is a parabola. But it is not written as y = ax2 bx c. It could be, if we
eliminated t. Then we would lose track of time. The parabola is y(x), with no parameter, where we have x(t) and y(t).
Basic question: Where does the projectile hit the ground? For the parabola, we solve
y(x) = 0. That gives the position x. For the projectile we solve y(t) = 0. That gives the
time it hits the ground, not the place. If that time is T, then x(T) gives the place.
The information is there. It takes two steps instead of one, but we learn more.
EXAMPLE 1 Water leaves the hose at 10 meters/second (this is v,). It starts up at the
angle a. Find the time T when y is zero again, and find where the projectile lands.

Solution The flight ends when y = (10 sin a)T - igT2 = 0. The flight time is T =
(20 sin a)/g. At that time, the horizontal distance is

x(T) = (10 cos a)T = (200 cos a sin a)/g. This is the range R.
The projectile (or water from the hose) hits the ground at x = R. To simplify, replace
200 cos a sin a by 100 sin 2a. Since g = 9.8 meters/sec2, we can't reach the car:
The range R = (100 sin 2~)/9.8is at most 10019.8. This is less than 12.
The range is greatest when sin 2a = I (a is 45"). To reach 12 meters we could stand
on a ladder (Problem 14). To hit a baseball against air resistance, the best angle is
nearer to 35". Figure 12.5 shows symmetric parabolas (no air resistance) and unsymmetric flight paths that drop more steeply.

Plane Motion: Projectiles and Cyclolds

EXAMPLE 2 What are the correct angles a for a given range R and given v,?
Solution The range is R = (vi sin 2a)lg. This determines the sine of 2a-but two
angles can have the same sine. We might find 2a = 60" or 120". The starting angles
a = 30" and a = 60" in Figure 12.5 give the same sin 2a and the same range R. The
flight times contain sin a and are different.
By calculus, the maximum height occurs when dyldt = 0. Then vo sin a = gt, which
means that t = (v, sin ix)/g. This is half of the total flight time T-the time going up
equals the time coming down. The value of y at this halfway time t = fT is

EXAMPLE 3 If a ski jumper goes 90 meters down a 30" slope, after taking off at 28
meterslsecond, find equations for the flight time and the ramp angle a.
Solution The jumper lands at the point x = 90 cos 30°, y = - 90 sin 30" (minus sign
for obvious reasons). The basic equation (2) is x = (28 cos a)t, y = (28 sin a)t - f gt 2.
Those are two equations for a and t. Note that t is not T, the flight time to y = 0.

Conclusion The position of a projectile involves three parameters vo, a, and t. Three
pieces of information determine theflight (almost). The reason for the word almost is
the presence of sin a and cos a. Some flight requirements cannot be met (reaching a
car at 12 meters). Other requirements can be met in two ways (when the car is close).
The equation sin ct = c is more likely to have no solution or two solutions than exactly
one solution.
Watch for the three pieces of information in each problem. When a football starts
at v, = 20 meterslsecond and hits the ground at x = 40 meters, the third fact is
. This is like a lawyer who is asked the fee and says $1000 for three questions.
"Isn't that steep?" says the client. "Yes," says the lawyer, "now what's your last
question?"

A projectile's path is a parabola. To compute it, eliminate t from the equations for x
and y. Problem 5 finds y = ax2 + bx, a parabola through the origin. The path of a
point on a wheel seems equally simple, but eliminating t is virtually impossible. The
cycloid is a curve that really needs and uses a parameter.
To trace out a cycloid, roll a circle of radius a along the x axis. Watch the point
that starts at the bottom of the circle. It comes back to the bottom at x = 2na, after
a complete turn of the circle. The path in between is shown in Figure 12.6. After a
century of looking for the xy equation, a series of great scientists (Galileo, Christopher
Wren, Huygens, Bernoulli, even Newton and l'H6pital) found the right way to study
a cycloid-by introducing a parameter. We will call it 8; it could also be t.

Fig. 12.6 Path of P on a rolling circle is a cycloid. Fastest slide to Q.

12 Motion Along a Curve

The parameter is the angle 0 through which the circle turns. (This angle is not at
the origin, like 0 in polar coordinates.) The circle rolls a distance a0, radius times
angle, along the x axis. So the center of the circle is at x = a0, y = a. To account for
the segment CP, subtract a sin 0 from x and a cos 0 from y:
The point P has x = a(0 - sin 0) and y = a(l - cos 0).

(3)
At 0 = 0 the position is (0,O). At 0 = 271 the position is (271a, 0). In between, the slope
of the cycloid comes from the chain rule:
dy dyld0
----

a sin 0
dx - dxld0 - a(l - cos 0)'

This is infinite at 0 = 0. The point on the circle starts straight upward and the cycloid
has a cusp. Note how all calculations use the parameter 0. We go quickly:

Question 1 Find the area under one arch of the cycloid (0 = 0 to 0 = 27c).
Answer The area is y dx =

est sliding time for any curve. The cycloid solves the "brachistochrone problem,"
which minimizes the time down curves from 0 to Q (Figure 12.6). You might think
a straight path would be quicker-it is certainly shorter. A straight line has the
equation x = 71~12,so the sliding time is

Jdt=~ds/&=Jr

Jmdy/&=&ZZJ&.

(5)

This is larger than the cycloid time a&.
It is better to start out vertically and pick
up speed early, even if the path is longer.
Instead of publishing his solution, John Bernoulli turned this problem into an
international challenge: Prove that the cycloid gives thefastest slide. Most mathematicians couldn't do it. The problem reached Isaac Newton (this was later in his life).
As you would expect, Newton solved it. For some reason he sent back his proof with
no name. But when Bernoulli received the answer, he was not fooled for a moment:
"I recognize the lion by his claws."
What is also amazing is a further property of the cycloid: The time to Q is the same
ifyou begin anywhere along the path. Starting from rest at P instead of 0 , the bottom
is reached at the same time. This time Bernoulli got carried away: "You will be
petrified with astonishment when I say...".
There are other beautiful curves, closely related to the cycloid. For an epicycloid,
the circle rolls around the outside of another circle. For a hypocycloid, the rolling
circle is inside the fixed circle. The astroid is the special case with radii in the ratio 1
to 4. It is the curved star in Problem 34, where x = a cos36 and y = a sin30.

12.2 Plane Motion: Projectiles and Cycloids

The cycloid even solves the old puzzle: What point moves backward when a train
starts jbrward? The train wheels have a flange that extends below the track, and
dxldt <: 0 at the bottom of the flange.

12.3 Curvature and Normal Vector

A driver produces acceleration three ways-by the gas pedal, the brake, and steering
wheel. The first two change the speed. Turning the wheel changes the direction. All
three change the velocity (they give acceleration). For steady motion around a circle,
the change is from steering-the acceleration dvldt points to the center. We now
look at motion along other curves, to separate change in the speed Ivl from change
in the direction T.
The direction of motion is T = vllvl. It depends on the path but not the speed
(because we divide by Ivl). For turning we measure two things:
1. How fast T turns: this will be the curvature K (kappa).
2. Which direction T turns: this will be the normal vector N.

and N depend, like s and T, only on the shape of the curve. Replacing t by 2t or
t 2 leaves them unchanged. For a circle we give the answers in advance. The normal
vector N points to the center. The curvature K is llradius.
A smaller turning circle means a larger curvature K:more bending..
K

The curvature K is change in direction (dTI divided by change in position Idsl. There
are three formulas for rc-a direct one for graphs y(x), a brutal but valuable one for
any parametric curve (x(t), y(t)), and a neat formula that uses the vectors v and a. We
begin with the definition and the neat formula.
DEFINITION

K

= ldT/ds)

FORMULA rc = lv x al/lvI3

(1)

The definition does not involve the parameter t-but the calculations do. The position vector R(t) yields v = dR/dt and a = dvldt. If t is changed to 2t, the velocity v is
doubled and r is multiplied by 4. Then lv x a1 and lv13 are multiplied by 8, and their
ratio K is unchanged.
Proof of formula (1)

Start from v = JvlTand compute its derivative a:
dlvl T + Ivl dT by the product rule.
a =dt
dt

Now take the cross product with v = IvJT.Remember that T x T = 0:

We know that IT1 = 1. Equation (4) will show that T is perpendicular to dTldt. So
Iv x a1 is the first length Ivl times the second length Ivl IdTIdtl. The factor sin 8 in the
length of a cross product is 1 from the 90" angle. In other words

The chain rule brings the extra Ids/dt( = Ivl into the denominator.
Before any examples, we show that dT/dt is perpendicular to T. The reason is that
T is a unit vector. Differentiate both sides of T T = 1:

12 Motion Along a Curve

That proof used the product rule U ' * V + U *V' for the derivative of U * V
(Problem 23, with U = V = T). Think of the vector T moving around the unit sphere.
To keep a constant length (T + d T) (T + dT) = 1, we need 2T dT = 0. Movement
dT is perpendicular to radius vector T.
Our first examples will be plane curves. The position vector R(t) has components
x(t) and y(t) but no z(t). Look at the components of v and a and v x a (x' means
dxldt):

Equation (5) is the brutal but valuable formula for K . Apply it to movement around
a circle. We should find K = llradius a:

This is 03a2/w3a3and w cancels. The speed makes no difference to

The third formula for K applies to an ordinary plane curve given by y(x). The
parameter t is x! You see the square root in the speed Ivl= dsldx:

In practice this is the most popular formula for K . The most popular approximation
is id 2y/dx21.(The denominator is omitted.) For the bending of a beam, the nonlinear
equation uses IC and the linear equation uses d 2 y / d ~ 2We

The approximation is y" = 1. This agrees with K at x = 0, where the parabola turns
the corner. But for large x, the curvature approaches zero. Far out on the parabola,
we go a long way for a small change in direction.
The parabola y = -fx2, opening down, has the same u. Now try a space curve.

Compare with a unit circle. Without the climbing term tk, the curvature would be 1.
Because of climbing, each turn of the helix is longer and K = f .
That makes one think: Is the helix twice as long as the circle? No. The length of a
turn is only increased by lvl = $. The other $ is because the tangent T slopes
upward. The shadow in the base turns a full 360°, but T turns less.
THE NORMAL VECTOR N

The discussion is bringing us to an important vector. Where K measures the rate of
turning, the unit vector N gives the direction of turning. N is perpendicular to T, and
in the plane that leaves practically no choice. Turn left or right. For a space curve,
follow dT.Remember equation (4), which makes dT perpendicular to T.
The normal vector N is a unit vector along dT/dt. It is perpendicular to T:
dT/ds 1 dT

FORMULA N=-

a.

To change dT/dt into a unit vector, cancel the
The normal vector is N =
- cos t i - sin t j. It is perpendicular to T. Since the k component is zero, N is horizontal. The tangent T slopes up at 45"-it goes around the circle at that latitude.
The normal N is tangent to this circle (N is tangent to the path of the tangent!).
So N stays horizontal as the helix climbs.
There is also a third direction, perpendicular to T and N. It is the binormal vector
B = T x N, computed in Problems 25-30. The unit vectors T, N, B provide the
natural coordinate system for the path-along the curve, in the plane of the curve,
and out of that plane. The theory is beautiful but the computations are not often
done-we stop here.

12 Motion Along a Curve

TANGENTIAL AND NORMAL COMPONENTS OF ACCELERATION

May I return a last time to the gas pedal and brake and steering wheel? The first
two give acceleration along T. Turning gives acceleration along N. The rate of turning
(curvature K) and the direction N are established. We now ask about the force
required. Newton's Law is F = ma, so we need the acceleration a-especially its
component along T and its component along N.
The acceleration is a = 7

For a straight path, d2s/dt2is the only acceleration-the ordinary second derivative.
The term ~ ( d s l d tis) ~the acceleration in turning. Both have the dimension of length/

The force to steer around a corner depends on curvature and speed-as all drivers
know. Acceleration is the derivative of v = lvlT = (ds/dt)T:

A fixed speed dsldt = 1 gives d2s/dt2= 0. The only acceleration is KN.

EXAMPLE 6

Find the components of a for circular speed-up R(t) = cos t 2 i + sin t 2 j.

Without stopping to think, compute dR/dt = v and dsldt = Ivl and v/lvl= T:

The derivative of dsldt = Ivl is d2s/dt2= 2. The derivative of v is a:
a = - 2 sin t 2 i + 2 cos t 2 j - 4 t 2 cos t 2 i - 4 t 2 sin t 2 j .
In the first terms of a we see 2T. In the last terms we must be seeing K ~ v ~Certainly

12.4 Polar Coordinates and Planetary Motion
This section has a general purpose-to do vector calculus in polar coordinates. It
also has a specific purpose- to study central forces and the motion of planets. The
main gravitational force on a planet is from the sun. It is a central force, because it
comes from the sun at the center. Polar coordinates are natural, so the two purposes
go together.
You may feel that the planets are too old for this course. But Kepler's laws are
more than theorems, they are something special in the history of mankind-"the
greatest scientific discovery of all time." If we can recapture that glory we should do
it. Part of the greatness is in the difficulty-Kepler was working sixty years before
Newton discovered calculus. From pages of observations, and some terrific guesses,
a theory was born. We will try to preserve the greatness without the difficulty, and
show how elliptic orbits come from calculus. The first conclusion is quick.
Motion in a central force #eld always stays in a plane.

F is a multiple of the vector R from the origin (central force). F also equals ma
(Newton's Law). Therefore R and a are in the same direction and R x a = 0. Then
R x v has zero derivative and is constant:
d
by the product rule: -(R x v ) = v x v
dt

+ R x a=O+O.

(1)

R x v is a constant vector H. So R stays in the plane perpendicular to H.
How does a planet move in that plane? We turn to polar coordinates. At each
point except the origin (where the sun is), u, is the unit vector ointing outward. It is
the position vector R divided by its length r (which is ~
d j :
u, = R/r = (xi + yj)/r = cos 8 i + sin 8 j.

(2)

+

That is a unit vector because cos28 sin28= 1. It goes out from the center.
Figure 12.9 shows u, and the second unit vector u, at a 90" angle:
The dot product is u, u, = 0. The subscripts r and 8 indicate direction (not derivative).
Question 1: How do u, and ue change as r changes (out a ray)? They don't.
Question 2: How do u, and u, change as 8 changes? Take the derivative:
-sin 8 i + cos 8 j = ue

duJd8

8 i - sin 8 j

12.4 Polar Coordinates and Planetary Motion

Fig. 12.9 u, is outward, uo is around the center. Components of v and a in those directions.

Since u, = Rlr, one formula is simple: The position vector is R = ru,. For its derivative
v = dR/dt, use the chain rule du,/dt = (dur/d8)(d8/dt)= (dO/dt)u,:
d

The velocity is v = -(ru,) = -u,

+ru, .

The outward speed is drldt. The circular speed is r dO/dt. The sum of squares is lvI2.
Return one more time to steady motion around a circle, say r = 3 and 8 = 2t. The
velocity is v = h e , all circular. The acceleration is - 124, all inward. For circles u,
is the tangent vector T. But the unit vector u, points outward and N points inwardthe way the curve turns.
Now we tackle acceleration for any motion in polar coordinates. There can be
speedup in r and speedup in 8 (also change of direction). Differentiate v in (5) by the
product rule:

For du,/dt and due/dt, multiply equation (4) by d8ldt. Then all terms contain u, or u,.
The formula for a is famous but not popular (except it got us to the moon):

In the steady motion with r = 3 and 8 = 2t, only one acceleration term is nonzero:
a = - 12u,. Formula (6) can be memorized (maybe). Problem 14 gives a new way to
reach it, using reie.
EXAMPLE 1 Find R and v and a for speedup 8 = t 2 around the circle r = 1.

Solution The position vector is R = u,. Then v and a come from (5-6):

This question and answer were also in Example 6 of the previous section. The acceleration was 2T + 4t2N. Notice again that T = u, and N = - u,, going round the circle.
EXAMPLE 2 Find R and v and Ivl and a for the spiral motion r = 3t, 8 = 2t.

Solution The position vector is R = 3t u,. Equation (5) gives velocity and speed:

v = 3 4 + 6tu,

and

ivl=

Jm.

12 Motion Along a Curve

The motion goes out and also around. From (6) the acceleration is -12t u, + 12ue.
The same answers would come more slowly from R = 3t cos 2t i + 3t sin 2t j.
This example uses polar coordinates, but the motion is not circular. One of Kepler's
inspirations, after many struggles, was to get away from circles.
KEPLER'S LAWS

You may know that before Newton and Leibniz and calculus and polar coordinates,
Johannes Kepler discovered three laws of planetary motion. He was the court mathematician to the Holy Roman Emperor, who mostly wanted predictions of wars.
Kepler also determined the date of every Easter-no small problem. His triumph
was to discover patterns in the observations made by astronomers (especially by
Tycho Brahe). Galileo and Copernicus expected circles, but Kepler found ellipses.
Law 1: Each planet travels in an ellipse with one focus at the sun.
Law 2: The vector from sun to planet sweeps out area at a steady rate: dA/dt =
constant.
Law 3: The length of the planet's year is T = ka3I2, where a = maximum distance
from the center (not the sun) and k = 2n/@
is the same for all planets.
With calculus the proof of these laws is a thousand times quicker. But Law 2 is the
only easy one. The sun exerts a central force. Equation (I) gave R x v = H = constant
for central forces. Replace R by ru, and replace v by equation (5):

This vector H is constant, so its length h = r2dO/dt is constant. In polar coordinates,
the area is dA = $r2d0. This area dA is swept out by the planet (Figure 12.10), and
we have proved Law 2:
dA/dt = i r 2 d01dt = i h = constant.

(8)

Near the sun r is small. So d0ldt is big and planets go around faster.

Fig. 12.10 The planet is on an ellipse with the sun at a focus. Note a, b, c, q.

Now for Law 1, about ellipses. We are aiming for 1/r = C - D cos 0, which is the
polar coordinate equation of an ellipse. It is easier to write q than llr, and find an
equation for q. The equation we will reach is d 'q/d02 + q = C. The desired q =
C - D cos 0 solves that equation (check this), and gives us Kepler's ellipse.

12.4 Polar Coordinates and Planetary Motion

The first step is to connect dr/dt to dqlde by the chain rule:

Notice especially dB/dt = h/r2 = hq2. What we really want are second derivatives:

After this trick of introducing q, we are ready for physics. The planet obeys Newton's
Law F = ma, and the central force F is the sun's gravity:

That right side is the u, component of a in (6). Change r to l/q and change dB/dt to
hq2. The preparation in (10) allows us to rewrite d2r/dt2 in equation (11). That
equation becomes

Dividing by

- h2q2gives

what we hoped for-the

simple equation for q:

d 'q/dB2 + q = G M / =~ C~(a constant).

(12)

The solution is q = C - D cos 8. Section 9.3 gave this polar equation for an ellipse or
parabola or hyperbola. To be sure it is an ellipse, an astronomer computes C and D
from the sun's mass M and the constant G and the earth's position and velocity. The
main point is that C > D. Then q is never zero and r is never infinite. Hyperbolas and
parabolas are ruled out, and the orbit in Figure 12.10 must be an ellipse.?
Astronomy is really impressive. You should visit the Greenwich Observatory in
London, to see how Halley watched his comet. He amazed the world by predicting
the day it would return. Also the discovery of Neptune was pure mathematicsthe path of Uranus was not accounted for by the sun and known planets. LeVerrier
computed a point in the sky and asked a Berlin astronomer to look. Sure enough
Neptune was there.
Recently one more problem was solved-to explain the gap in the asteroids around
Jupiter. The reason is "chaos"-the
three-body problem goes unstable and an
asteroid won't stay in that orbit. We have come a long way from circles.
Department of Royal Mistakes The last pound note issued by the Royal Mint
showed Newton looking up from his great book Principia Mathematica. He is not
smiling and we can see why. The artist put the sun at the center! Newton has just
proved it is at the focus. True, the focus is marked S and the planet is P. But those
rays at the center brought untold headaches to the Mint-the note is out of circulation. I gave an antique dealer three pounds for it (in coins).
Kepler's third law gives the time T to go around the ellipse-the planet's year.
What is special in the formula is a3Iz-and for Kepler himself, the 15th of May 1618
was unforgettable: "the right ratio outfought the darkness of my mind, by the great
proof afforded by my labor of seventeen years on Brahe's observations." The second

This chapter is at the center of multidimensional calculus. Other chapters and other
topics may be optional; this chapter and these topics are required. We are back to
the basic idea of calculus-the derivative. There is a functionf, the variables move a
little bit, and f moves. The question is how much f moves and how fast. Chapters
1-4 answered this question for f(x), a function of one variable. Now we have f(x, y)
orf(x, y, z)-with two or three or more variables that move independently. As x and
y change,f changes. The fundamental problem of differential calculus is to connect

13 Partial Derivatives

13.1 Surfaces and Level Curves
The graph of y =f(x) is a curve in the xy plane. There are two variables-x is
independent and free, y is dependent on x. Above x on the base line is the point (x, y)
on the curve. The curve can be displayed on a two-dimensional printed page.
The graph of z =f(x, y) is a surface in xyz space. There are three variables-x and
y are independent, z is dependent. Above (x, y) in the base plane is the point (x, y, z)
on the surface (Figure 13.1). Since the printed page remains two-dimensional, we
shade or color or project the surface. The eyes are extremely good at converting twodimensional images into three-dimensional understanding--they get a lot of practice.
The mathematical part of our brain also has something new to work on-two partial
derivatives.
This section uses examples and figures to illustrate surfaces and their level curves.
The next section is also short. Then the work begins.
EXAMPLE I

Describe the surface and the level curves for z =f(x, y) =

x2 + y2 .

The surface is a cone. Reason: x 2 + y2 is the distance in the base plane from (0, 0)
to (x, y). When we go out a distance 5 in the base plane, we go up the same distance
5 to the surface. The cone climbs with slope 1. The distance out to (x, y) equals the
distance up to z (this is a 450 cone).
The level curves are circles. At height 5, the cone contains a circle of points-all
at the same "level" on the surface. The plane z = 5 meets the surface z = x2 + y 2 at
those points (Figure 13.1b). The circle below them (in the base plane) is the level
curve.
DEFINITION A level curve or contour line of z =f(x, y) contains all points (x, y) that
share the same valuef(x, y) = c. Above those points, the surface is at the height z = c.
There are different level curves for different c. To see the curve for c = 2, cut
through the surface with the horizontal plane z = 2. The plane meets the surface
above the points where f(x, y) = 2. The level curve in the base plane has the equation
f(x, y) = 2. Above it are all the points at "level 2" or "level c" on the surface.
Every curve f(x, y) = c is labeled by its constant c. This produces a contour map
(the base plane is full of curves). For the cone, the level curves are given by
.x 2 + y2 = c, and the contour map consists of circles of radius c.
Question What are the level curves of z =f(x, y) = x2 + y2 ?
Answer Still circles. But the surface is not a cone (it bends up like a parabola). The
circle of radius 3 is the level curve x2 + y2 = 9. On the surface above, the height is 9.

Surfaces and Level Curves

EXAMPLE 2 For the linearfunction f(x, y) = 2x + y, the surface is a plane. Its level
curves are straight lines. The surface z = 2x + y meets the plane z = c in the line

2x + y = c. That line is above the base plane when c is positive, and below when c is
negative. The contour lines are in the base plane. Figure 13.2b labels these parallel
lines according to their height in the surface.
Question

If the level curves are all straight lines, must they be parallel?

Answer No. The surface z = y/x has level curves y/x = c. Those lines y = cx swing
around the origin, as the surface climbs like a spiral playground slide.

The weather map shows contour lines of the temperaturefunction. Each

level curve connects points at a constant temperature. One line runs from Seattle to
Omaha to Cincinnati to Washington. In winter it is painful even to think about the
line through L.A. and Texas and Florida. USA Today separates the contours by
color, which is better. We had never seen a map of universities.

13 Pattial Derhrcttiwes

Question From a contour map, how do you find the highest point?
Answer The level curves form loops around the maximum point. As c increases the
loops become tighter. Similarly the curves squeeze to the lowest point as c decreases.
EXAMPLE 4 A contour map of a mountain may be the best example of all. Normally
the level curves are separated by 100 feet in height. On a steep trail those curves are
bunched together-the trail climbs quickly. In a flat region the contour lines are far
apart. Water runs perpendicular to the level curves. On my map of New Hampshire
that is true of creeks but looks doubtful for rivers.

Question Which direction in the base plane is uphill on the surface?
Answer The steepest direction is perpendicular to the level curves. This is important.
Proof to come.
EXAMPLE 5 In economics x2y is a utility function and x2y = c is an indiference c u m .

The utility function x2y gives the value of x hours awake and y hours asleep. Two
hours awake and fifteen minutes asleep have the value f = (22)(4). This is the same as
one hour of each: f = (12)(1).Those lie on the same level curve in Figure 13.4a. We
are indifferent, and willing to exchange any two points on a level curve.
The indifference curve is "convex." We prefer the average of any two points. The
line between two points is up on higher level curves.
Figure 13.4b shows an extreme case. The level curves are straight lines 4 x + y = c.
Four quarters are freely substituted for one dollar. The value is f = 4x + y dollars.
Figure 13.4~shows the other extreme. Extra left shoes or extra right shoes are
useless. The value (or utility) is the smaller of x and y. That counts pairs of shoes.

Partial Derivatives
The central idea of differential calculus is the derivative. A change in x produces a
change in$ The ratio Af/Ax approaches the derivative, or slope, or rate of change.
What to do iff depends on both x and y?
The new idea is to vary x and y one at a timk. First, only x moves. If the function
is x + xy, then Af is Ax + yAx. The ratio Af/Ax is 1 + y. The "x derivative" of x + xy

13 Partial Derhratives

is 1 + y. For all functions the method is the same: Keep y constant, change x, take the
firnit of AflAx:
DEFINITION

Af = lim f (x + Ax, Y)-f (x, Y)
df(x, y) = lim AX-OAX
AX-o
ax
Ax

On the left is a new symbol af/dx. It signals that only x is allowed to vary-afpx is
a partial derivative. The different form a of the same letter (still say "d") is a reminder
that x is not the only variable. Another variable y is present but not moving.

Do not treat y as zero! Treat it as a constant, like 6. Its x derivative is zero.
If f(x) = sin 6x then dfldx = 6 cos 6x. If f(x, y) = sin xy then af/ax = y cos xy.
Spoken aloud, af/ax is still "d f d x." It is a function of x and y. When more is
needed, call it "the partial off with respect to x." The symbolf ' is no longer available,
since it gives no special indication about x. Its replacement fx is pronounced "fx" or
"fsub x," which is shorter than af/ax and means the same thing.
We may also want to indicate the point (x,, yo) where the derivative is computed:

EXAMPLE 2 f(x, y) = sin 2x cos y

fx = 2 cos

2x cos y

(cos y is constant for a/dx)

The particular point (x,, yo) is (0,O). The height of the surface is f(0,O) = 0.
The slope in the x direction is fx = 2. At a different point x, = n, yo = n we find
fx(n, n) = - 2.
Now keep x constant and vary y. The ratio Af/Ay approaches aflay:
f,(x, y) = lim
AY+O

f(x, Y + BY)-f(x,
f
= lim
Ay A ~ + O
AY

Y)

This is the slope in the y direction. Please realize that a surface can go up in the x
direction and down in the y direction. The plane f(x, y) = 3x - 4y has fx = 3 (up) and
f , = - 4 (down). We will soon ask what happens in the 45" direction.

The x derivative of ,/xZ+y'is really one-variable calculus, because y is constant.
The exponent drops from to - i,and there is 2x from the chain rule. This distance
function has the curious derivative af/ax = xlf.
2. The
The graph is a cone. Above the point (0,2) the height is ,/-=
partial derivatives are fx = 012 and f, = 212. At that point, Figure13.5 climbs in the
y direction. It is level in the x direction. An actual step Ax will increase O2 + 22 to
AX)^ + 22. But this change is of order (Ax)2 and the x derivative is zero.

Figure 13.5 is rather important. It shows how af@x and af/dy are the ordinary
derivatives of f(x, yo) and f(x,, y). It is natural to call these partial functions. The first
has y fixed at yo while x varies. The second has x fixed at xo while y varies. Their
graphs are cross sections down the surface-cut out by the vertical planes y = yo and
x = x,. Remember that the level curve is cut out by the horizontal plane z = c.

The limits of Af/Ax and Af/Ay are computed as always. With partial functions
we are back to a single variable. The partial derivative is the ordinary derivative of a
partial function (constant y or constant x). For the cone, af/ay exists at all points
except (0, 0). The figure shows how the cross section down the middle of the cone
produces the absolute value function:f(0, y) = lyl. It has one-sided derivatives but not
a two-sided derivative.
Similarly Of/ax will not exist at the sharp point of the cone. We develop the idea
of a continuous function f(x, y) as needed (the definition is in the exercises). Each
partial derivative involves one direction, but limits and continuity involve all directions. The distance function is continuous at (0, 0), where it is not differentiable.
EXAMPLE 4 f(x, y) = y

2

af/Ox = - 2x

Of/ay = 2y

Move in the x direction from (1, 3). Then y 2 - x 2 has the partial function 9 - x 2 .
With y fixed at 3, a parabola opens downward. In the y direction (along x = 1) the
partial function y 2 - 1 opens upward. The surface in Figure 13.6 is called a hyperbolic
paraboloid, because the level curves y 2 -_ 2 = c are hyperbolas. Most people call it a
saddle, and the special point at the origin is a saddle point.
The origin is special for y 2 - x 2 because both derivatives are zero. The bottom of
the y parabolaat (0, 0) is the top of the x parabola.The surface is momentarily flat in

all directions. It is the top of a hill and the bottom of a mountain range at the same

time. A saddle point is neither a maximum nor a minimum, although both derivatives
are zero.

Note Do not think that f(x, y) must contain y2 and x2 to have a saddle point. The
function 2xy does just as well. The level curves 2xy = c are still hyperbolas. The
partial functions 2xyo and 2xoy now give straight lines-which is remarkable. Along
the 45" line x = y, the function is 2x2 and climbing. Along the - 45" line x = - y,
the function is -2x2 and falling. The graph of 2xy is Figure 13.6 rotated by 45".
EXAMPLES 5-6

f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2

P(T, V) = nRT/V

Example 5 shows more variables. Example 6 shows that the variables may not be
named x and y. Also, the function may not be named f! Pressure and temperature
and volume are P and T and V. The letters change but nothing else:
aP/aT = nR/V

dP/aV = - ~ R T / V ~ (note the derivative of 1/V).

There is no dP/aR because R is a constant from chemistry-not a variable.
Physics produces six variables for a moving body-the coordinates x, y, z and the
momenta p,, p,, p,. Economics and the social sciences do better than that. If there
are 26 products there are 26 variables-sometimes 52, to show prices as well as
amounts. The profit can be a complicated function of these variables. The partial
derivatives are the marginalprofits, as one of the 52 variables is changed. A spreadsheet
shows the 52 values and the effect of a change. An infinitesimal spreadsheet shows
the derivative.
SECOND DERIVATIVE

Genius is not essential, to move to second derivatives. The only difficulty is that two
first derivatives f, and f , lead to four second derivativesfxx and fxy and f , and f,.
(Two subscripts: f,, is the x derivative of the x derivative. Other notations are
d2flax2 and a2f/axdy and a*flayax and d2flay2.) Fortunately fxy equals f,, as we
see first by example.
EXAMPLE 7 f = x/y has f, = l/y, which has

fxx

=0

and f,

=

- l/y2.

The function x/y is linear in x (which explainsfxx = 0). Its y derivative isf, = - xly2.
This has the x derivative f,,, = -l/y2. The mixed derivativesfxy and fyx are equal.
In the pure y direction, the second derivative isf, = 2x/y3. One-variable calculus
is sufficient for all these derivatives, because only one variable is moving.
EXAMPLE 8 f = 4x2

+ 3xy + y2 has f, = 8x + 3y

and f , = 3x + 2y.

Both "cross derivatives" f,, andf,, equal 3. The second derivative in the x direction
is a2f/ax2 = 8 or fxx = 8. Thus "fx x" is "d second f d x squared." Similarly
a2flay2 = 2. The only change is from d to a.
Iff(x, y) has continuous second derivatives thenf,, =&,. Problem 43 sketches a proof
based on the Mean Value Theorem. For third derivatives almost any example shows
that f,, =fxyx =f,, is different from fyyx =fyxy =fxyy .
Question How do you plot a space curve x(t), y(t), z(t) in a plane? One way is to look
parallel to the direction (1, 1, 1). On your XY screen, plot X = (y - x ) / d and
Y = (22 - x - y)/$. The line x = y = z goes to the point (0, O)!

How do you graph a surface z =f (x, y)? Use the same X and Y. Fix x and let y
vary, for curves one way in the surface. Then fix y and vary x, for the other partial
function. For a parametric surface like x = (2 + v sin i u ) cos u, y = (2 + v sin f u) sin u,
z = v cos iu, vary u and then u. Dick Williamson showed how this draws a one-sided
"Mobius strip."

13.3 Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations

Over a short range, a smooth curve y =f(x) is almost straight. The curve changes
direction, but the tangent line y - yo =f '(xo)(x - xo) keeps the same slope forever.
The tangent line immediately gives the linear approximation to y=f(x):
Y = Yo +f'(xo)(x - xo).
What happens with two variables? The function is z =f(x, y), and its graph is a
surface. We are at a point on that surface, and we are near-sighted. We don't see far
away. The surface may curve out of sight at the horizon, or it may be a bowl or a
saddle. To our myopic vision, the surface looks flat. We believe we are on a plane
(not necessarily horizontal), and we want the equation of this tangent plane.

13.3 Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations
Notation The basepoint has coordinates x0 and Yo. The height on the surface is
zo =f(xo, Yo). Other letters are possible: the point can be (a, b) with height w. The

subscript o indicates the value of x or y or z or 8f/Ox or aflay at the point.
With one variable the tangent line has slope df/dx. With two variables there
are two derivatives df/8x and Of/Oy. At the particular point, they are (af/ax)o and

(af/ay)o.

Those are the slopes of the tangent plane. Its equation is the key to this

chapter:

43A The tangent plane at (xo, Yo, zo) has the same slopes as the surface z =
f(x, y). The equation of the tangent plane (a linear equation) is

z - zo =

(x- Xo) + A (yo).

The normal vector N to that plane has components (af/ax)0 , (0f/ly)o, -1.

- 2y. When x = 1 and y = 2

those are (af/ax)o = - 2 and (df/ay)o = - 4. The equation of the tangent plane is
z - 9 = - 2(x - 1)- 4(y - 2)

or

z+2x+4y= 19.

This z(x, y) has derivatives - 2 and - 4, just like the surface. So the plane is tangent.
The normal vector N has components -2, -4, -1. The equation of the normal
line is (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 9) + t(- 2, - 4, - 1). Starting from (1, 2, 9) the line goes out along
N-perpendicular to the plane and the surface.

N =

Fig. 13.7

The tangent plane contains the x and y tangent lines, perpendicular to N.

Figure 13.7 shows more detail about the tangent plane. The dotted lines are the x
and y tangent lines. They lie in the plane. All tangent lines lie in the tangent plane!
These particular lines are tangent to the "partial functions"--where y is fixed at Yo =
2 or x is fixed at x0 = 1. The plane is balancing on the surface and touching at the
tangent point.
More is true. In the surface, every curve through the point is tangent to the plane.
Geometrically, the curve goes up to the point and "kisses" the plane.t The tangent
T to the curve and the normal N to the surface are perpendicular: T . N = 0.
tA safer word is "osculate." At saddle points the plane is kissed from both sides.

- S. The equation of the tangent plane is linear:

z - 3 = - ½(x - 1) - 1(y - 2). I cannot resist improving the equation, by multiplying

through by 3 and moving all terms to the left side:
tangent plane to sphere:

l(x - 1) + 2(y - 2) + 3(z - 3) = 0.

(4)

If mathematics is the "science of patterns," equation (4) is a prime candidate for study.
The numbers 1, 2, 3 appear twice. The coordinates are (xo, Yo, zo) = (1, 2, 3). The
normal vector is ii + 2j + 3k. The tangent equation is lx + 2y + 3z = 14. None of this
can be an accident, but the square root of 14 - x 2 - y2 made a simple pattern look
complicated.
This square root is not necessary. Calculus offers a direct way to find dz/dx-

implicit differentiation. Just differentiate every term as it stands:
y2

14 leads to 2x + 2z az/ax = 0 and 2y + 2z az/ay = 0. (5)

Canceling the 2's, the derivatives on a sphere are - x/z and - y/z. Those are the same

as in (3). The equation for the tangent plane has an extremely symmetric form:
Z - Zo =

THE TANGENT PLANE TO F(x, y, z)= c
The sphere suggests a question that is important for other surfaces. Suppose the
equation is F(x, y, z) = c instead of z =f(x, y). Can the partial derivatives and tangent

plane be found directly from F?
The answer is yes. It is not necessary to solve first for z. The derivatives of F,

13.3 Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations

computed at (xo, Yo, zo), give a second formula for the tangent plane and normal
vector.

k.

Notice how this includes the original case z =f(x, y). The function F becomes
f(x, y) - z. Its partial derivatives are Of/Ox and Of/Oy and -1. (The -1 is from the
derivative of - z.) Then equation (7)is the same as our original tangent equation (1).
EXAMPLE 3
Solution

The surface F = x 2 + y 2 - z 2 = c is a hyperboloid.Find its tangent plane.

The partial derivatives are Fx = 2x, F, = 2y, Fz = - 2z. Equation (7) is
tangent plane: 2xo(x - xo) + 2 yo(y - Yo) - 2zo(z - zo)= 0.

(8)

We can cancel the 2's. The normal vector is N = x 0 i + yoj - z0 k. For c > 0 this
hyperboloid has one sheet (Figure 13.8). For c = 0 it is a cone and for c < 0 it breaks
into two sheets (Problem 13.1.26).
DIFFERENTIALS
Come back to the linear equation z - zo = (Oz/Ox) 0(x - x0 ) + (Oz/Oy)o(y - Yo) for the

tangent plane. That may be the most important formula in this chapter. Move along
the tangent plane instead of the curved surface. Movements in the plane are dx and
dy and dz-while Ax and Ay and Az are movements in the surface. The d's are
governed by the tangent equation- the A's are governed by z =f(x, y). In Chapter 2
the d's were differentials along the tangent line:
dy = (dy/dx)dx (straight line) and Ay,

(dy/dx)Ax (on the curve).
(9)
Now y is independent like x. The dependent variable is z. The idea is the same. The
distances x - x0 and y - yo and z - zo (on the tangent plane) are dx and dy and dz.
The equation of the plane is
dz = (Oz/Ox) 0dx + (Oz/Oy)ody or

df=fxdx +fdy.

(10)
This is the total differential. All letters dz and df and dw can be used, but Oz and Of
are not used. Differentials suggest small movements in x and y; then dz is the resulting
movement in z. On the tangent plane, equation (10) holds exactly.
A "centering transform" has put x0 , Yo, zo at the center of coordinates. Then the
"zoom transform" stretches the surface into its tangent plane.
EXAMPLE 4 The area of a triangle is A = lab sin 0. Find the total differential dA.
Solution The base has length b and the sloping side has length a. The angle between
them is 0. You may prefer A = ½bh, where h is the perpendicular height a sin 0. Either

EXAMPLE 5 The volume of a cylinder is V = nr2 h. Decide whether V is more sensitive
to a change from r = 1.0 to r = 1.1 or from h = 1.0 to h = 1.1.
Solution

The partial derivatives are

V/Or = 2n7rh and DV/ah = irr2 . They measure

the sensitivity to change. Physically, they are the side area and base area of the
cylinder. The volume differential dV comes from a shell around the side plus a layer
on top:
dV = shell + layer = 2nrh dr + rr 2dh.

(12)

Starting from r = h = 1, that differential is dV= 2rndr + 7rdh. With dr = dh = .1, the

shell volume is .21t and the layer volume is only .17r. So V is sensitive to dr.
For a short cylinder like a penny, the layer has greater volume. Vis more sensitive
to dh. In our case V= rTr 2h increases from n(1) 3 to ~n(1.1)3 . Compare AV to dV:
AV= n(1.1) 3 - 7(1) 3 = .3317r

and

dV= 27r(.1)+

7n(.1)= .3007r.

The difference is AV- dV= .0317. The shell and layer missed a small volume in
Figure 13.9, just above the shell and around the layer. The mistake is of order
(dr)2 + (dh)2 . For V= 7rr 2 h, the differential dV= 27rrh dr + 7rr 2 dh is a linearapproximation to the true change A V. We now explain that properly.
LINEAR APPROXIMATION
Tangents lead immediately to linear approximations. That is true of tangent planes as

it was of tangent lines. The plane stays close to the surface, as the line stayed close
to the curve. Linear functions are simpler than f(x) or f(x, y) or F(x, y, z). All we
need are first derivatives at the point. Then the approximation is good near the point.
This key idea of calculus is already present in differentials. On the plane, df equals
fxdx +fydy. On the curved surface that is a linear approximation to Af:
43C

The linear approximation to f(x, y) near the point (xo, Yo) is
f(x, y) ýf(xo, Yo) + (

(x -

Xo)

+

(

y(y - Yo).

(13)

In other words Af fxAx +fAy, as proved in Problem 24. The right side of (13)
is a linear function fL(x, y). At (xo, yo), the functions f and fL have the same slopes.
Then f(x, y) curves away fromfL with an error of "second order:"
If(x, y) -fL(x, Y)I < M[(x - Xo) 2 + (y - yo) 2 ].

(14)

This assumes thatfx,,,fx, and fy are continuous and bounded by M along the line
from (xo, Yo) to (x, y). Example 3 of Section 13.5 shows that If,,I < 2M along that line.
A factor ½ comes from equation 3.8.12, for the error f-fL with one variable.

For the volume of a cylinder, r and h went from 1.0 to 1.1. The second derivatives
of V = lrr 2 h are V, , = 27rh and Vh = 27rr and Vhh = 0. They are below M = 2.27r. Then
(14) gives the error bound 2.27r(.1 2 + .12) = .0447r, not far above the actual error .03 17r.
The main point is that the error in linear approximation comes from the quadratic

terms-those are the first terms to be ignored by fL.

If x is fixed at 1,
If y is fixed at 2, this is a one-variable approximation to

involve dx and dy in a square root. It doesn't. Distance involves x and y in a square

tangent plane. Linear approximation breaks down.
The next example shows how to approximate Az from Ax and Ay, when the
equation is F(x, y, z) = c. We use the implicit derivatives in (7) instead of the explicit
derivatives in (1). The idea is the same: Look at the tangent equation as a way to
find Az, instead of an equation for z. Here is Example 6 with new letters.

Then solve for Az, which gives Az z (x/z)Ax + (y/z)Ay-the same as Example 6.
EXAMPLE 8 How does the equilibrium price change when the supply curve changes?

The equilibrium price is at the intersection of the supply and demand curves
(supply =: demand). As the price p rises, the demand q drops (the slope is - .2):
demand line DD: p = - .2q + 40.

(15)

The supply (also q) goes up with the price. The slope s is positive (here s = .4):
supply line SS: p = sq + t = .4q + 10.
Those lines are in Figure 13.10. They meet at the equilibrium price P = $30. The
quantity Q = 50 is available at P (on SS) and demanded at P (on DD). So it is sold.
Where do partial derivatives come in? The reality is that those lines DD and SS
are not fixed for all time. Technology changes, and competition changes, and the
value of money changes. Therefore the lines move. Therefore the crossing point (Q, P)
also moves. Please recognize that derivatives are hiding in those sentences.

13 Partial Derivatives

Main point: The equilibrium price P is a function of s and t. Reducing s by better
technology lowers the supply line to p = .3q + 10. The demand line has not changed.
The customer is as eager or stingy as ever. But the price P and quantity Q are
different. The new equilibrium is at Q = 60 and P = $28, where the new line XX
crosses DD.
If the technology is expensive, the supplier will raise t when reducing s. Line YY
is p = .3q + 20. That gives a higher equilibrium P = $32 at a lower quantity Q = 40the demand was too weak for the technology.
Calculus question Find dP/ds and aP/at. The difficulty is that P is not given as
a function of s and t. So take implicit derivatives of the supply = demand equations:

supply = demand: P
s derivative:

t derivative:

+ 40 = sQ + t
P, = - .2Q, = sQ, + Q
P, = - .2Q, = sQ, + 1

= - .2Q

(16)
(note t, = 0)
(note t, = 1)

Now substitute s = .4, t = 10, P = 30, Q = 50. That is the starting point, around which
we are finding a linear approximation. The last two equations give P, = 5013 and
P, = 113 (Problem 25). The linear approximation is

Comment This example turned out to be subtle (so is economics). I hesitated before
including it. The equations are linear and their derivatives are easy, but something
in the problem is hard-there is no explicit formula for P. The function P(s, t) is not
known. Instead of a point on a surface, we are following the intersection of two lines.
The solution changes as the equation changes. The derivative of the solution comes from
the derivative of the equation.
Summary The foundation of this section is equation (1) for the tangent plane. Everything builds on that-total differential, linear approximation, sensitivity to small
change. Later sections go on to the chain rule and "directional derivatives" and
"gradients." The central idea of differential calculus is Af z f,Ax +f,,Ay.
N W O N ' S METHOD F O R MI0 EQUATIONS

Linear approximation is used to solve equations. To find out where a function is zero,
look first to see where its approximation is zero. To find out where a graph crosses
the xy plane, look to see where its tangent plane crosses.
Remember Newton's method for f(x) = 0. The current guess is x,. Around that
point, f(x) is close to f(x,) + (x - x,)f'(x,). This is zero at the next guess x,,, =
x, -f(x,)/f'(x,). That is where the tangent line crosses the x axis.
With two variables the idea is the same- but two unknowns x and y require two
equations. We solve g(x, y) = 0 and h(x, y) = 0. Both functions have linear approximations that start from the current point (x,, y,)-where derivatives are computed:

The natural idea is to set these approximations to zero. That gives linear equations
for x - x, and y - y,. Those are the steps Ax and Ay that take us to the next guess

EXAMPLE 9 g = x 3 - y = 0 and h = y3 - x = 0 have 3 solutions (1, 1), (0, 0), (-1, -1).
I will start at different points (xo, yo). The next guess is x, = xo + Ax, yl = Yo + Ay.
It is of extreme interest to know which solution Newton's method will choose-if it
converges at all. I made three small experiments.
1. Suppose (xo, yo) = (2, 1). At that point g = 2 - 1 = 7 and h = 13 - 2 = -1. The
derivatives are gx = 3x2 = 12, gy = - 1, hx = - 1, hy = 3y 2 = 3. The steps Ax and Ay
come from solving (19):
12Ax - Ay= -7

Ax = - 4/7

x = xo + Ax= 10/7

-Ax+3Ay= +1

Ay= + 1/7

= yo + Ay= 8/7.

This new point (10/7, 8/7) is closer to the solution at (1, 1). The next point is (1.1,
1.05) and convergence is clear. Soon convergence is fast.
2. Start at (xo, Yo) = (½, 0). There we find g = 1/8 and h = - 1/2:

(3/4)Ax -

Ay= -1/8

- Ax + OAy= + 1/2

Ax = - 1/2

x = xo +

Ay = + 1/4

y, = yo + Ay = - 1/4.

=Ax

Newton has jumped from (½,0) on the x axis to (0, - f) on the y axis. The next step
goes to (1/32, 0), back on the x axis. We are in the "basin of attraction" of (0, 0).
3. Now start further out the axis at (1, 0), where g = 1 and h = - 1:

3Ax-

Ay= -1

-Ax+OAy=

Ax= -1

x= xo+Ax=0O

Ay=-2

yl=yo+Ay=-2.

Newton moves from (1, 0) to (0, -2) to (16, 0). Convergence breaks down-the
method blows up. This danger is ever-present, when we start far from a solution.
Please recognize that even a small computer will uncover amazing patterns. It can
start from hundreds of points (xo, Yo), and follow Newton's method. Each solution
has a basin of attraction,containing all (xo, Yo) leading to that solution. There is also
a basin leading to infinity. The basins in Figure 13.11 are completely mixed togethera color figure shows them asfractals.The most extreme behavior is on the borderline
between basins, when Newton can't decide which way to go. Frequently we see chaos.
Chaos is irregular movement that follows a definite rule. Newton's method determines an iteration from each point (x,, y,) to the next. In scientific problems it
normally converges to the solution we want. (We start close enough.) But the computer makes it posible to study iterations from faraway points. This has created a
new part of mathematics-so new that any experiments you do are likely to be
original.

Partial Derivatives

Section 3.7 found chaos when trying to solve x 2 + 1 = 0. But don't think Newton's
method is a failure. On the contrary, it is the best method to solve nonlinear equations.
The error is squared as the algorithm converges, because linear approximations have
errors of order (Ax) 2 + (Ay) 2 . Each step doubles the number of correct digits, near
the solution. The example shows why it is important to be near.

13.4 Directional Derivatives and Gradients
As x changes, we know how f(x, y) changes. The partial derivative dfldx treats y as
constant. Similarly df/dy keeps x constant, and gives the slope in the y direction. But
east-west and north-south are not the only directions to move. We could go along a
45" line, where Ax = Ay. In principle, before we draw axes, no direction is preferred.
The graph is a surface with slopes in all directions.
On that surface, calculus looks for the rate of change (or the slope). There is a
directional derivative, whatever the direction. In the 45" case we are inclined to divide
Af by Ax, but we would be wrong.
Let me state the problem. We are given f(x, y) around a point P = (x,, yo). We are
also given a direction u (a unit vector). There must be a natural definition of D,fthe derivative off in the direction u. To compute this slope at P, we need a formula.
Preferably the formula is based on df/dx and dfldy, which we already know.
Note that the 45" direction has u = i/$ + j/$. The square root of 2 is going to
enter the derivative. This shows that dividing Af by Ax is wrong. We should divide
by the step length As.
EXAMPLE 1 Stay on the surface z = xy. When (x, y) moves a distance As in the 45"
direction from (1, I), what is Az/As?

Solution The step is As times the unit vector u. Starting from x = y = 1 the step
ends at x = y = 1 + AS/$. (The components of "As are AS/$.) Then z = xy is

r = (1 + ~ s / f i )=~1 + $AS
The ratio AzlAs approaches

+ %As)',

fi as As

+ 0.

which means Az = $AS

+ $(As)2.

That is the slope in the 45" direction.

DEFINITION The derivative off'in the direction u at the point P is

D,f ( P ) :

The step from P = (x,, yo) has length As. It takes us to (x, + ulAs, yo + u2As). We
compute the change Af and divide by As. But formula (2) below saves time.

13.4 Directional Derivatives and Gradients

The x direction is u = (1, 0). Then uAs is (As, 0) and we recover af/ax:

f(xo + As, Yo) -f(xo, Yo) approaches D(1, 0 )f

As

Similarly Df= aflay, when u = (0, 1) is in the y direction. What is D,f when u=
(0, -1)? That is the negative y direction, so Df= - aflay.
CALCULATING THE DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE
D,f is the slope of the surface z =f(x, y) in the direction u. How do you compute it?
From af/ax and af/ay, in two special directions, there is a quick way to find Df in
all directions. Remember that u is a unit vector.
13E

The directionalderivative D,f in the direction u = (u1 , u 2) equals

af

,f

Df= - ua+ - u 2 .

(2)

The reasoning goes back to the linear approximation of Af:
Af4Ax+f
f
Af" Ax + Ay= ulAs+
u2 As.

ay

ay

Divide by As and let As approach zero. Formula (2) is the limit of Af/As, as the
approximation becomes exact. A more careful argument guarantees this limit provided f and fy are continuous at the basepoint (xo,Yo).
Main point: Slopes in all directions are known from slopes in two directions.

EXAMPLE 1 (repeated)

f= xy and P = (1,1)and u = (1/,i, 1//-2). Find Df(P).

The derivatives f = y and fy = x equal 1 at P. The 450 derivative is
D.f(P) =fuI +fyu

2=

1(1/./) + 1(1//2) = /2 as before.

EXAMPLE 2

The linear function f= 3x + y + 1 has slope Df= 3u, + u2 .
The x direction is u = (1, 0), and D.f= 3. That is af/ax. In the y direction Df= 1.
Two other directions are special--along the level lines off(x, y) and perpendicular:

Level direction:

D.f is zero because f is constant

Steepest direction: D.f is as large as possible (with u2 + u2 = 1).

To find those directions, look at D,f= 3u, + u2 . The level direction has 3u, + u2 = 0.
Then u is proportional to (1, - 3). Changing x by 1 and y by - 3 produces no change
in f= 3x + y + 1.
In the steepest direction u is proportional to (3, 1). Note the partial derivatives
f = 3 and fy = 1. The dot product of (3, 1) and (1, -3) is zero-steepest direction
is perpendicular to level direction.To make (3, 1) a unit vector, divide by 1/0.
Steepest climb:

D,f= 3(3/_0) + l(1//10) = 10//10 = /10

Steepest descent: Reverse to u= (-3//10, -1//10)

and

Df= -/10.

The contour lines around a mountain follow Df= 0. The creeks are perpendicular.
On a plane like f= 3x + y + 1, those directions stay the same at all points
(Figure 13.12). On a mountain the steepest direction changes as the slopes change.

THE GRADIENT VECTOR

Look again at ful +fu 2 , which is the directional derivative Duf. This is the dot
product of two vectors. One vector is u = (u1 , u2 ), which sets the direction. The other
vector is (f,,f,), which comes from the function. This second vector is the gradient.

k in three dimensions .

The space-saving symbol V is read as "grad." In Chapter 15 it becomes "del."
For the linear function 3x + y + 1, the gradient is the constant vector (3, 1). It is
the way to climb the plane. For the nonlinear function x 2 + xy, the gradient is the
non-constant vector (2x + y, x). Notice that gradf shares the two derivatives in N =
(f£,fy, -1). But the gradient is not the normal vector. N is in three dimensions,
pointing away from the surface z =f(x, y). The gradient vector is in the xy plane! The
gradient tells which way on the surface is up, but it does that from down in the base.
The level curve is also in the xy plane, perpendicular to the gradient. The contour
map is a projection on the base plane of what the hiker sees on the mountain. The
vector grad f tells the direction of climb, and its length Igradfl gives the steepness.
13F The directional derivative is Df= (grad f) u. The level direction is perpendicular to gradf, since D,f= 0. The slope Df is largest when u is parallel to
gradf. That maximum slope is the length Igradfl = Xf +fy:

The example f= 3x + y + 1 had grad f= (3, 1). Its steepest slope was in the direction u = (3, 1)/!10. The maximum slope was F10. That is Igradf I= S + 1.
Important point: The maximum of (gradf) *u is the length Igradf1.In nonlinear
examples, the gradient and steepest direction and slope will vary. But look at one
particular point in Figure 13.13. Near that point, and near any point, the linear
picture takes over.
On the graph off, the special vectors are the level direction L = (fy, -fx, 0) and
the uphill direction U = (,,f
x +f 2) and the normal N = (f,fy, - 1). Problem 18
checks that those are perpendicular.

13.4 Directional Derivatives and Gradients

EXAMPLE 3 The gradient of f(x, y) = (14 - x2 - y2)/3 is Vf

= (-

2x13, - 2~13).

On the surface, the normal vector is N = (- 2x13, - 2~13,- 1). At the point (1,2, 3),
this perpendicular is N = (- 213, - 413, - 1). At the point (1, 2) down in the base,
the gradient is (- 213, - 413). The length of grad f is the slo e ,/%/3.
Probably a hiker does not go straight up. A "grade" of &/3 is fairly steep (almost
150%). To estimate the slope in other directions, measure the distance along the path
between two contour lines. If Af = 1 in a distance As = 3 the slope is about 113. This
calculation is not exact until the limit of AflAs, which is DJ

Fig. 13.13 N perpendicular to surface and grad f perpendicular to level line (in the base).

EXAMPLE 4

The gradient of f(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz has three components.

The pattern extends fromf(x, y) tof(x, y, z). The gradient is now the three-dimensional
vector ( j ; , fy ,f,). For this function grad f is (y + z, x + z, x + y). To draw the graph
of w =f(x, y, z) would require a four-dimensional picture, with axes in the xyzw
directions.
Notice: the dimensions. The graph is a 3-dimensional "surface" in 4-dimensional
space. The gradient is down below in the 3-dimensional base. The level sets off come
from xy -tyz + zx = c-they are 2-dimensional. The gradient is perpendicular to that
level set (still down in 3 dimensions). The gradient is not N! The normal vector is
(fx ,fy ,fz :, - I), perpendicular to the surface up in 4-dimensional space.

goes radially outward. The steepness of the cone is the length of the gradient vector:
lgrad zl = J(x/z)~ + ( y l ~=) 1~ because z2 = x2 + y2 on the cone.

13 Partial Derivatives

DERIVATIVES ALONG CURVED PATHS

On a straight path the derivative off is D,f = (gradf ) u. What is the derivative on
a curved path? The path direction u is the tangent vector T. So replace u by T, which
gives the "direction" of the curve.
The path is given by the position vector R(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j. The velocity is v =
(dx/dt)i + (dy/dt)j. The tangent vector is T = vllvl. Notice the choice-to move at any
speed (with v) or to go at unit speed (with T). There is the same choice for the
derivative of.f(x, y) along this curve:
df
afdx
rateofchange --(gradf)*v=--+-ax dt
dt

af dy
ay dt
af dy

df
af dx
slope -=(gradf)*T=--+-ds
ax ds ay ds
The first involves time. If we move faster, dfldt increases. The second involves distance.
If we move a distance ds, at any speed, the function changes by df. So the slope in
that direction is dflds. Chapter 1 introduced velocity as dfldt and slope as dyldx and
mixed them up. Finally we see the difference.
Uniform motion on a straight line has R = R, + vt. The velocity v is constant. The
direction T = u = vllvl is also constant. The directional derivative is (grad f ) u, but
the rate of change is (grad f ) v.
Equations (4) and (5) look like chain rules. They are chain rules. The next section
extends dfldt = (df/dx)(dx/dt) to more variables, proving (4) and (5). Here we focus
on the meaning: dflds is the derivative off in the direction u = T along the curve.
EXAMPLE 7

Find dfldt and dflds for f = r. The curve is x = t2, y = t in Figure 13.14a.

Solution The velocity along the curve is v = 2ti + j. At the typical point t = 1 it is
v = 2i + j. The unit tangent is T = v/&. The gradient is a unit vector i l f i j / f i
pointing outward, when f (x, y) is the distance r from the center. The dot product
with v is dfldt = 3 / d . The dot product with T is dflds = 3 / a .
When we slow down to speed 1 (with T), the changes in f(x, y) slow down too.

+

EXAMPLE 8 Find dflds for f = xy along the circular path x = cos t, y = sin t.

First take a direct approach. On the circle, xy equals (cos t)(sin t).Its derivative comes
from the product rule: dfldt = cos2t - sin2t. Normally this is different from dflds,
because the time t need not equal the arc length s. There is a speed factor dsldt to
divide by-but here the speed is 1. (A circle of length s = 271 is completed at t = 2n.)
Thus the slope dflds along the roller-coaster in Figure 13.14 is cos2t - sin2t.

Fig. 13.14 The distance f = r changes along the curve. The slope of the roller-coaster is
(grad f ) T. The distance D from (x,, y o ) has grad D = unit vector.

13.4 Directional DerhrcrHves and Gradients

The second approach uses the vectors grad f and T. The gradient off = xy is
(y, x) = (sin t, cos t). The unit tangent vector to the path is T = (- sin t, cos t). Their
dot product is the same dflds:
slope along path = (grad f ) T = - sin2t + cos2t.
GRADIENTS WITHOUT COORDINAJES

This section ends with a little "philosophy." What is the coordinate-free dejnition of
the gradient? Up to now, grad f = (fx,f,,) depended totally on the choice of x and y
axes. But the steepness of a surface is independent of the axes. Those are added later,
to help us compute.
The steepness dflds involves only f and the direction, nothing else. The gradient
should be a "tensorw-its meaning does not depend on the coordinate system. The
gradient has different formulas in different systems (xy or re or ...), but the direction
and length of gradf are determined by dflds-without any axes:
The drrection of grad f is the one in which dflds is largest.
The length Igrad f 1 is that largest slope.
The key equation is (change inf ) x (gradient off) (changein position). That is another
way to write Af x fxAx +@y. It is the multivariable form-we used two variablesof the basic linear approximation Ay x (dy/dx)Ax.
EXAMPLE 9 D(x, y) = distance from (x, y) to (x,, yo). Without derivatives prove
lgrad Dl = 1. The graph of D(x, y) is a cone with slope 1 and sharp point (x,, yo).

First question In which direction does the distance D(x, y) increase fastest?
Answer Going directly away from (x,, yo). Therefore this is the direction of grad D.
Second question How quickly does D increase in that steepest direction?
~nswer A step of length As increases D by As. Therefore ]grad Dl = AslAs = 1.

Conclusion grad D is a unit vector. The derivatives of D in Problem 48 are
(x - xo)/D and (y - yo)/D. The sum of their squares is 1, because (x - x,)~+
(y - yo)*equals D ~ .

13.5 The Chain Rule
Calculus goes back and forth between solving problems and getting ready for harder
problems. The first is "application," the second looks like "theory." If we minimizef
to save time or money or energy, that is an application. If we don't take derivatives
to find the minimum-maybe because f is a function of other functions, and we don't
have a chain rule-then it is time for more theory. The chain rule is a fundamental
working tool, because f(g(x)) appears all the time in applications. So do f(g(x, y)) and
f(x(t), y(t)) and worse. We have to know their derivatives. Otherwise calculus can't
continue with the applications.
You may instinctively say: Don't bother with the theory, just teach me the formulas.
That is not possible. You now regard the derivative of sin 2x as a trivial problem,
unworthy of an answer. That was not always so. Before the chain rule, the slopes of
sin 2x and sin x2 and sin2x2were hard to compute from Af/Ax. We are now at the
same point for f(x, y). We know the meaning of dfldx, but iff = r tan B and x = r cos 8
and y = r sin 8, we need a way to compute afldx. A little theory is unavoidable, if the
problem-solving part of calculus is to keep going.
To repeat: The chain rule applies to a function of a function. In one variable that
was f(g(x)). With two variables there are more possibilities:
1. f ( ~ )

withz=g(x,y)

2. f(x, y) with x = x(t), y = y(t)

Find df/dx and afldy
Find dfldt

3. f(x, y) with x = x(t, u), y = y(t, u) Find dfldt and afldu

13 Partial Derhrattves

All derivatives are assumed continuous. More exactly, the input derivatives like
ag/ax and dxldt and dx/au are continuous. Then the output derivatives like af/ax
and dfldt and df/au will be continuous from the chain rule. We avoid points like
r = 0 in polar coordinates-where ar/dx = x/r has a division by zero.
A Typical Problem Start with a function of x and y, for example x times y. Thus
f(x, y) = xy. Change x to r cos 8 and y to r sin 8. The function becomes (r cos 8) times
(r sin 8). We want its derivatives with respect to r and 8. First we have to decide on
its name.
To be correct, we should not reuse the letter5 The new function can be F :

f(r cos 8, r sin 8) = (r cos 8)(r sin 8) = F(r, 8).
f(x, y) = x y
W h y not call it f(r, 8)? Because strictly speaking that is r times 8! If we follow the
rules, then f(x, y) is x y and f(r, 8) should be re. The new function F does the right
thing-it multiplies (r cos 8)(r sin 8). But in many cases, the rules get bent and the
letter F is changed back to 5
This crime has already occurred. The end of the last page ought to say dFlat.
Instead the printer put dfldt. The purpose of the chain rule is to find derivatives in
the new variables t and u (or r and 8). In our example we want the derivative of F
with respect to r. Here is the chain rule:
d~ - d f a x
---dr dx ar

+ g?

dyer

= (y)(cos8)

+ (x)(sin8) = 2r sin 8 cos 8.

I substituted r sin 8 and r cos 8 for y and x. You immediately check the answer:
F(r, 8) = r2 cos 8 sin 8 does lead to ZF/dr = 2r cos 8 sin 8. The derivative is correct.
The only incorrect thing-but we do it anyway-is to write f instead of F.

THE DERIVATIVES OF f(g(x, y))

Here g depends on x and y, and f depends on g. Suppose x moves by dx, while y
stays constant. Then g moves by dg = (ag/ax)dx. When g changes, f also changes:
df = (df/dg)dg. Now substitute for dg to make the chain: df = (df/dg)(ag/dx)dx.This

The inside function is g = x + cy. The outside function can be anything, g2 or sin g
or eg. The composite function is ( x + cy)2 or sin(x + cy) or ex+cy. In each separate

EXAMPLE 1 Every f ( x

case we could check that df/dy = c dfldx. The chain rule produces this equation in
all cases at once, from aglax = 1 and i?g/ay = c:

This is important: af/ay = c afldx is our first example of a partial dierential equation.
The unknown f(x, y) has two variables. Two partial derivatives enter the equation.

13.5 The Chain Rule

Up to now we have worked with dyldt and ordinary di$ercntial equations. The
independent variable was time or space (and only one dimension in space). For partial
differential equations the variables are time and space (possibly several dimensions
in space). The great equations of mathematical physics-heat equation, wave equation, Laplace's equation-are partial differential equations.
Notice how the chain rule applies to f = sin xy. Its x derivative is y cos xy. A patient
reader would check that f is sing and g is xy and f, is &g,. Probably you are not
so patient-you know the derivative of sin xy. Therefore we pass quickly to the next
chain rule. Its outside function depends on two inside functions, and each of those
depends on t. We want dfldt.
THE DERIVATIVE OF f(x(t), y(t))

Before the formula, here is the idea. Suppose t changes by At. That affects x and y;
they change by Ax and Ay. There is a domino effect onfi it changes by A$ Tracing
backwards,

dt

Substitute the last two into the first, connecting Af to At. Then let At -,0:

This is close to the one-variable rule dzldx = (dz/dy)(dy/dx).There we could "cancel"
dy. (We actually canceled Ay in (Az/Ay)(Ay/Ax), and then approached the limit.)
Now At affects Af in two ways, through x and through y. The chain rule has two
terms. If we cancel in (af/ax)(dx/dt) we only get one of the terms!
We mention again that the true name for f(x(t), y(t)) is F(t) not f(t). For f(x, y, z)
the rule has three terms: fxx, +fyyt +fiz, isf, (or better dF/dt).
EXAMPLE 2 How quickly does the temperature change when you drive to Florida?

Suppose the Midwest is at 30°F and Florida is at 80°F. Going 1000 miles south
increases the temperaturef(x, y) by 50°, or .05 degrees per mile. Driving straight south
at 70 miles per hour, the rate of increase is (.05)(70)= 3.5 degrees per hour. Note how
(degreeslmile) times (miles/hour)equals (degrees/hour). That is the ordinary chain rule
(df/dx)(dx/dt) = (df/dt)- there is no y variable going south.
If the road goes southeast, the temperature is f = 30 + .05x + .Oly. Now x(t) is
distance south and y(t) is distance east. What is dfldt if the speed is still 70?

In reality there is another term. The temperature also depends directly on t, because
of night and day. The factor cos(2?ct/24)has a period of 24 hours, and it brings an
extra term into the chain rule:
df af dx af dy af
For f(x, y, t) the chain rule is - = -- +--+-.

This is the total derivative dfldt, from all causes. Changes in x, y, t all affect J The
partial derivative af/dt is only one part of dfldt. (Note that dtldt = 1.) If night and

day add 12 cos(2nt/24)tof, the extra term is df/at = - n sin(2nt124). At nightfall that
is - n degrees per hour. You have to drive faster than 70 mph to get warm.
SECOND DERIVATIVES

What is d2f/dt2? We need the derivative of (4), which is painful. It is like acceleration
in Chapter 12, with many terms. So start with movement in a straight line.
Suppose x = xo t cos 9 and y = yo + t sin 9. We are moving at the fixed angle 9,
with speed 1. The derivatives are x, = cos 9 and y, = sin 9 and cos29 + sin29 = 1. Then
dfldt is immediate from the chain rule:

+

f, =fxx, +fyyt=fx cos 9 +f, sin 9.
For the second derivativef,,, apply this rule to f,. Then f,, is
cos 9 + (f,), sin 9 = (fxx cos 9 +Ax sin 9) cos 9 + (f, cos 9 +fyy sin 9) sin 9.

f,, =fxx cos26 + 2fxy cos 6 sin 6 +fYy sin26.

Collect terms:

(6)
In polar coordinates change t to r. When we move in the r direction, 9 is fixed.
Equation (6) givesf, from fxx,fxy,fyy. Second derivatives on curved paths (with new
terms from the curving) are saved for the exercises.
EXAMPLE 3 If fxx,fxy,fyy are all continuous and bounded by M, find a bound onf;,.
This is the second derivative along any line.

Solution Equation (6) gives If,l < M cos26 + M sin 29 + M sin29< 2M. This upper
bound 2M was needed in equation 13.3.14, for the error in linear approximation.
THE DERIVATIVES OF f(x(t, u), y(t, u))

Suppose there are two inside functions x and y, each depending on t and u. When t
moves, x and y both move: dx = x,dt and dy = y,dt. Then dx and dy force a change
inf df =fxdx +fydy. The chain rule for af/& is no surprise:
131 Chain rule for f(x(t, u), y(t, u)):

This rule has a/at instead of dldt, because of the extra variable u. The symbols remind
us that u is constant. Similarly t is constant while u moves, and there is a second
chain rule for aflau: fu =fxxu+f,yu.
EXAMPLE 4

In polar coordinates findf, andf,,. Start from f(x, y) =f(r cos 9, r sin 9).

The chain rule uses the 6 derivatives of x and y:

The second 9 derivative is harder, because (8) has four terms that depend on 6. Apply
the chain rule to the first term af/ax. It is a function of x and y, and x and y are
functions of 9:

The 8 derivative of af/dy is similar. So apply the product rule to (8):
= [fxx(-

r sin 8) fx,(r cos 8)] (- r sin 8) +fx(- r cos 8)

+ [fYx(- r sin 8) +fyy(r cos 8)](r cos 8) +f,(-

(9)

This formula is not attractive. In mathematics, a messy formula is almost always a
signal of asking the wrong question. In fact the combination f,, f,, is much more
special thian the separate derivatives. We might hope the same forf,, +f,,, but dimensionally that is impossible-since r is a length and 8 is an angle. The dimensions of
f,, andf,, are matched byf,, andf,/r and f,,/r2. We could even hope that

A PARADOX

Before leiaving polar coordinates there is one more question. It goes back to drldx,
which wals practically the first example of partial derivatives:

My problem is this. We know that x is r cos 8. So x/r on the right side is cos 8. On
the other hand r is xlcos 8. So &-/ax is also l/cos 8. How can drldx lead to cos 8 one
way and l/cos 8 the other way?
I will admit that this cost me a sleepless night. There must be an explanationwe cannot end with cos 8 = l/cos 8. This paradox brings a new respect for partial
derivatives. May I tell you what I finally noticed? You could cover up the next
paragraph and think about the puzzle first.
The key to partial derivatives is to ask: Which variable is held constant? In
equation (11), y is constant. But when r = xlcos 8 gave &/ax = l/cos 8 , 8 was constant.
In both cases we change x and look at the effect on r. The movement is on a horizontal
line (constant y) or on a radial line (constant 8). Figure 13.15 shows the difference.
Remark This example shows that drldx is different from l/(dx/ar). The neat formula
(dr/dx)(dx/dr)= 1 is not generally true. May I tell you what takes its place? We have
to includle (dr/dy)(ay/dr). With two variables xy and two variables re, we need 2 by
2 matrices! Section 14.4 gives the details:

NON-INDEPENDENT VARIABLES

This paradox points to a serious problem. In computing partial derivatives off(x, y, z),
we assumed that x, y, z were independent. Up to now, x could move while y and z
were fixed. In physics and chemistry and economics that may not be possible. If there
is a relation between x, y, z, then x can't move by itself.
EXAMPLE 5 The gas law PV = nRT relates pressure to volume and temperature.

P, V, T are not independent. What is the meaning of dV/aP? Does it equal l/(dP/aV)?
Those questions have no answers, until we say what is held constant. In the paradox,
&/ax had one meaning for fixed y and another meaning for fixed 8. To inrlicate what
is held constant, use an extra subscript (not denoting a derivative):
(af/aP), has constant volume and (af/aP), has constant temperature. The usual
af/dP has both V and T constant. But then the gas law won't let us change P.

+ 2y + Z. Compute af/ax on the plane z = 4x + y.
Think of x and y as independent. Replace z by 4x + y:
f = 3x + 2~ + ( 4 +~y) so (af/ax), = 7.

EXAMPLE 6 Let f = 3x

Solution 1

Solution 2 Keep x and y independent. Deal with z by the chain rule:

(aflax), = aflax

+ (aflaz)(az/ax)= 3 + (I)(+ = 7.

Solution 3 (di$evnt) Make x and z independent. Then y = z - 4x:

Without a subscript, af/ax means: Take the x derivative the usual way. The answer
is af/ax = 3, when y and z don't move. But on the plane z = 4x + y, one of them must
move! 3 is only part of the total answer, which is (aflax), = 7 or (af/ax), = - 5.
Here is the geometrical meaning. We are on the plane z = 4x + y. The derivative
(afldx),, moves x but not y. To stay on the plane, dz is 4dx. The change in f =
3~+2y+zisdf=3dx+O+dz=7dx.
EXAMPLE 7 On the world line x2 + y2 + z2 = t2 find (af/dy),,, for f = xyzt.

The subscripts x, z mean that x and z are fixed. The chain rule skips af/dx and
aflaz :
(af1a~)X.z= aflay + (aflat)(at/ay)= xzt + (xyz)(y/t). Why ylt?
EXAMPLE 8 From the law PV = T, compute the product (aP/aV),(aV,/aT),(aT/aP),.

49 True or false: The directional derivative of f(r, 8) in the
direction of u, is af/a8.

The outstanding equation of differential calculus is also the simplest: dfldx = 0. The
slope is zero and the tangent line is horizontal. Most likely we are at the top or
bottom of the graph-a maximum or a minimum. This is the point that the engineer
or manager or scientist or investor is looking for-maximum stress or production
or velocity or profit. With more variables in f(x, y) and f(x, y, z), the problem becomes
more realistic. The question still is: How to locate the maximum and minimum?
The answer is in the partial derivatives. When the graph is level, they are zero.
Deriving the equations f, = 0 and f, = 0 is pure mathematics and pure pleasure.
Applying them is the serious part. We watch out for saddle points, and also for a
minimum at a boundary point-this section takes extra time. Remember the steps
for f(x) in one-variable calculus:
1. The leading candidates are stationary points (where dfldx = 0).
2. The other candidates are rough points (no derivative) and endpoints (a or b).
3. Maximum vs. minimum is decided by the sign of the second derivative.
In two dimensions, a stationary point requires af/dx = 0 and df/ay = 0. The tangent
line becomes a tangent plane. The endpoints a and b are replaced by a boundary
curve. In practice boundaries contain about 40% of the minima and 80% of the work.

505

Maxima, Minima, and Saddle Points

13.6

Finally there are three second derivativesfxx,fxy, and fy,. They tell how the graph
bends away from the tangent plane-up at a minimum, down at a maximum, both
ways at a saddle point. This will be determined by comparing (fxx)(fyy) with (fx) 2 .
STATIONARY POINT -+ HORIZONTAL TANGENT -- ZERO DERIVATIVES

Supposef has a minimum at the point (xo, Yo). This may be an absolute minimum or
only a local minimum. In both casesf(xo, yo) <f(x, y) near the point. For an absolute
minimum, this inequality holds wherever f is defined. For a local minimum, the
inequality can fail far away from (xo, yo). The bottom of your foot is an absolute
minimum, the end of your finger is a local minimum.
We assume for now that (xo, Yo) is an interior point of the domain off. At a
boundary point, we cannot expect a horizontal tangent and zero derivatives.
Main conclusion: At a minimum or maximum (absolute or local) a nonzero derivative is impossible. The tangent plane would tilt. In some direction f would decrease.
Note that the minimum point is (xo, yo), and the minimum value is f(xo, yo).
13J

If derivatives exist at an interior minimum or maximum, they are zero:
Of/lx = 0

and

Oflay = 0

(together this is grad f= 0).

(1)

For a function f(x, y, z) of three variables, add the third equation af/az = 0.
The reasoning goes back to the one-variable case. That is because we look along the
lines x = x0 and y = Yo. The minimum off(x, y) is at the point where the lines meet.
So this is also the minimum along each line separately.

Moving in the x direction along y = yo, we find Of/Ox = 0. Moving in the y direction,
Of/Oy = 0 at the same point. The slope in every direction is zero. In other words

grad f= 0.
Graphically, (xo, Yo) is the low point of the surface z =f(x, y). Both cross sections
in Figure 13.16 touch bottom. The phrase "if derivatives exist" rules out the vertex
of a cone, which is a rough point. The absolute value f= IxI has a minimum without
df/dx = 0, and so does the distance f= r. The rough point is (0, 0).

EXAMPLE 2

(Steiner'sproblem)

Find the point that is nearest to three given points.

This example is worth your attention. We are locating an airport close to three cities.
Or we are choosing a house close to three jobs. The problem is to get as near as
possible to the corners of a triangle. The best point depends on the meaning of "near."
The distance to the first corner (x, , y,) is dl = ,/(x - x,), + (y - y,),. The distances to the other corners (x,, y,) and (x,, y,) are d; and d,. Depending on whether
cost equals (distance) or (di~tance)~
or (di~tance)~,
our problem will be:
Minimize

d,+d,+d,

or d : + d i + d :

oreven d ~ + d ~ + d ~

The second problem is the easiest, when d: and d t and d i are quadratics:
a ~ j a x = 2 ~ ~ - x l + x - x 2 + x - x 3 ~ = ~a f / a y = 2 [ y - y l + y - y 2 + y - y 3 1 = o .

Solving iflax = 0 gives x = i ( x l + x, + x,). Then af/dy = 0 gives y = i(y, + y, + y,).
The best point is the centroid of the triangle (Figure 13.17a). It is the nearest point
to the corners when the cost is (distance),. Note how squaring makes the derivatives
linear. Least squares dominates an enormous part of applied mathematics.

U3

Fig. 13.17 The centroid minimizes d :

+ d $ + d 3 . The Steiner point minimizes dl + d2 + d3

The real "Steiner problem" is to minimize f(x, y) = dl + d, + d, . We are laying down
roads from the corners, with cost proportional to length. The equations f, = 0 and
f , = 0 look complicated because of square roots. But the nearest point in
Figure 13.17b has a remarkable property, which you will appreciate.
Calculus takes derivatives of d : = (x - xl), + (y - y,),. The x derivative leaves
2dl(ddl/dx) = 2(x - x,). Divide both sides by 2d1:

This gradient is a unit vector. The sum of (x - ~ , ) ~ / dand
: (y - yJ2/d: is d:/d: = 1.
This was already in Section 13.4: Distance increases with slope 1 away from the
center. The gradient of dl (call it u,) is a unit vector from the center point (x,, y,).

13.6 Maxima, Minima, and Saddle Points

Similarly the gradients of d, and d, are unit vectors u2 and u3. They point directly
away from the other corners of the triangle. The total cost is f(x, y) = dl + d , + d3,
so we add the gradients. The equations f, = 0 and f, = 0 combine into the vector
equation
grad f = u, + u2 + u3 = 0 at the minimum.
The three unit vectors add to zero! Moving away from one corner brings us closer to
another. The nearest point to the three corners is where those movements cancel.
This is the meaning of "grad f = 0 at the minimum."
It is unusual for three unit vectors to add to zero-this can only happen in one
way. The three directions must form angles of 120". The best point has this property,
which is .repeated in Figure 13.18a. The unit vectors cancel each other. At the "Steiner
point," the roads to the corners make 120" angles. This optimal point solves the
problem,, except for one more possibility.

The other possibility is a minimum at a rough point. The graph of the distance
function d,(x, y) is a cone. It has a sharp point at the center (x,, y,). All three corners
of the triangle are rough points for dl + d, + d,, so all of them are possible minimizers.
Suppo,se the angle at a corner exceeds 120". Then there is no Steiner point. Inside

The key equations are still dfldx = 0 and df/ay = 0. Solving them requires a computer
and an algorithm. To share the work fairly, I will supply the algorithm (Newton's
method) if you supply the computer. Seriously, this is a terrific example. It is typical
of real problems-we know dfldx and dflay but not the point where they are zero.
You can calculate that nearest point, which changes as p changes. You can also
discover new mathematics, about how that point moves. I will collect all replies I
receive tlo Problems 38 and 39.

13 Partial Derivatives

MINIMUM OR MAXIMUM ON THE BOUNDARY

Steiner's problem had no boundaries. The roads could go anywhere. But most applications have restrictions on x and y, like x 3 0 or y d 0 or x2 + y 2 2 1. The minimum
with these restrictions is probably higher than the absolute minimum. There are three
possibilities:

(1) stationary point fx

= 0, fy = 0

(2) rough point

(3) boundary point

That third possibility requires us to maximize or minimize f(x, y) along the boundary.
EXAMPLE 3

Minimize f(x, y) = x2 + xy + y2 - x - y + 1 in the halfplane x 2 0.

The minimum in Example 1 was 3 . It occurred at x, = 3, yo = 3. This point is still
allowed. It satisfies the restriction x 3 0. So the minimum is not moved.
EXAMPLE 4

Minimize the same f (x, y) restricted to the lower halfplane y < 0.

Now the absolute minimum at (3, i)is not allowed. There are no rough points. We
look for a minimum on the boundary line y = 0 in Figure 13.19a. Set y = 0, so f
depends only on x. Then choose the best x:
f(x, 0) = x2 + 0 - x - 0 + 1

and

fx

= 2x -

1 = 0.

The minimum is at x = and y = 0, where f = 2. This is up from

Minimize the same f(x, y) on or outside the circle x2 + y 2 = 1.

One possibility is fx = 0 and f,,= 0. But this is at (i
k),,inside the circle. The other
possibility is a minimum at a boundary point, on the circle.
To follow this boundary we can set y =
The function f gets complicated,
and dfldx is worse. There is a way to avoid square roots: Set x = cos t and y = sin t.
Then f = x2 + xy + y 2 - x - y + 1 is a function of the angle t:

Now dfldt = 0 locates a minimum or maximum along the boundary. The first factor
(cos t - sin t ) is zero when x = y. The second factor is zero when cos t + sin t = 1, or
x + y = 1. Those points on the circle are the candidates. Problem 24 sorts them out,
and Section 13.7 finds the minimum in a new way-using "Lagrange multipliers."

13.6

Maxima, Minima, and Saddle Points

Minimization on a boundary is a serious problem-it gets difficult quickly-and
multipliers are ultimately the best solution.
MAXIMUM VS. MINIMUM VS. SADDLE POINT
How to separate the maximum from the minimum? When possible, try all candidates
and decide. Computef at every stationary point and other critical point (maybe also
out at infinity), and compare. Calculus offers another approach, based on second
derivatives.
With one variable the second derivative test was simple: fxx > 0 at a minimum,
fxx = 0 at an inflection point, fxx < 0 at a maximum. This is a local test, which may
not give a global answer. But it decides whether the slope is increasing (bottom of
the graph) or decreasing (top of the graph). We now find a similar test for f(x, y).
The new test involves all three second derivatives. It applies where fx = 0 and
f, = 0. The tangent plane is horizontal. We ask whether the graph off goes above or
below that plane. The tests fxx > 0 and fy, > 0 guarantee a minimum in the x and y
directions, but there are other directions.
EXAMPLE 6 f(x, y) = x 2 + lOxy + y2 has fxx = 2, fx = 10, fyy, = 2 (minimum or not?)
All second derivatives are positive-but wait and see. The stationary point is (0, 0),
where af/ax and aflay are both zero. Our function is the sum of x2 + y2, which goes
upward, and 10xy which has a saddle. The second derivatives must decide whether
x 2 + y 2 or lOxy is stronger.
Along the x axis, where y = 0 and f= x 2, our point is at the bottom. The minimum
in the x direction is at (0, 0). Similarly for the y direction. But (0, 0) is not a minimum
point for the whole function, because of lOxy.
Try x = 1, y = - 1. Then f= 1 - 10 + 1, which is negative. The graph goes below
the xy plane in that direction. The stationary point at x = y = 0 is a saddle point.

The second derivatives 2, 1, 2 are again positive. The graph curves up in the x and y
directions. But there is a big difference from Example 6: fx, is reduced from 10 to 1.
It is the size offx (not its sign!) that makes the difference. The extra terms - x - y + 4
in Example 1 moved the stationary point to (-, -). The second derivatives are still
2, 1, 2, and they pass the test for a minimum:

That algebra can be checked (notice the 2b). It is the conclusion that's important:

if a < 0 and ac > b , both parts are negative:
if ac < b2 , the parts have opposite signs:

maximum at (0, 0)

Since the test involves the square of b, its sign has no importance. Example 6 had
b = 5 and a saddle point. Example 7 had b = 1 and a2 minimum. Reversing to

- x2 - xy - y2 yields a maximum. So does - x + xy - y
Now comes the final step, from ax 2 + 2bxy + cy 2 to a general functionf(x, y). For
all functions, quadratics or not, it is the second order terms that we test.
EXAMPLE 8 f(x, y) = ex - x - cos y has a stationary point at x = 0, y = 0.
The first derivatives are ex - 1 and sin y, both zero. The second derivatives arefxx
ex = 1 and fry = cos y = 1 and fxy = 0. We only use the derivatives at the stationary
point. The first derivatives are zero, so the second order terms come to the front in
the series for ex - x - cos y:
(1+ x + ½x2

..._

2

...

+ higher order terms.

(7)

There is a minimum at the origin. The quadratic part ½x2 + ½y 2 goes upward. The x 3
and y 4 terms are too small to protest. Eventually those terms get large, but near a
stationary point it is the quadratic that counts. We didn't need the whole series,
because from fxx =f,, = 1 and fxy = 0 we knew it would start with ½x 2 + ½y 2.
13L The test in 43K applies to the second derivatives a =fxx, b =fx,, c =fy
of any f(x, y) at any stationary point. At all points the test decides whether the
graph is concave up, concave down, or "indefinite."
EXAMPLE 9 f(x, y) = exy has fx = yexy and f, = xexy. The stationary point is (0, 0).
The second derivatives at that point are a =fxx = 0, b =fxy = 1, and c =fy, = 0.The
test b 2 > ac makes this a saddle point. Look at the infinite series:
exY = 1 + xy + x 2y 2 + ...

No linear term becausefx =f,= 0: The origin is a stationarypoint. No x 2 or y 2 term
(only xy): The stationary point is a saddle point.
At x = 2, y = - 2 we find fxxfry > (fxy) 2 . The graph is concave up at that pointbut it's not a minimum since the first derivatives are not zero.
The series begins with the constant term-not important. Then come the linear
terms-extremely important. Those terms are decided by first derivatives, and they
give the tangent plane. It is only at stationary points-when the linear part disappears
and the tangent plane is horizontal-that second derivatives take over. Around any
basepoint, these constant-linear-quadraticterms are the start of the Taylor series.

13.6

Maxima, Minima, and Saddle Points
THE TAYLOR SERIES

We now put together the whole infinite series. It is a "Taylor series"-which means
it is a power series that matches all derivatives off (at the basepoint). For one

variable, the powers were x" when the basepoint was 0. For two variables, the
powers are x" times y' when the basepoint is (0, 0). Chapter 10 multiplied the nth
derivative d"f/dx n by xl/n! Now every mixed derivative (d/dx)"(d/8y)mf(x, y) is computed
at the basepoint (subscript o).

We multiply those numbers by x"y m/n!m! to match each derivative of f(x, y):

13M When the basepoint is (0, 0), the Taylor series is a double sum 1ya,,mxp.
The term anmxnym has the same mixed derivative at (0, 0) asf(x, y). The series is

The derivatives of this series agree with the derivatives off(x, y) at the basepoint.
The first three terms are the linear approximation to f(x, y). They give the tangent
plane at the basepoint. The x2 term has n = 2 and m = 0, so n!m! = 2. The xy term
has n = m = 1, and n!m! = 1. The quadraticpart-ax 2 + 2bxy + cy 2 ) is in control when
the linearpart is zero.

the special case that was omitted in 13M and 43N.
It is the two-dimensional version of an inflection point. The second derivatives fail to
decide the concavity. When fxxfy, = (fxy) 2, the decision is passed up to the higher
derivatives. But in ordinary practice, the Taylor series is stopped after the quadratics.
If the basepoint moves to (xo, Yo), the powers become (x - xo)"(y - yo)m"-and all
derivatives are computed at this new basepoint.
Final question: How would you compute a minimum numerically? One good way is
to solve fx = 0 and fy = 0. These are the functions g and h of Newton's method
(Section 13.3). At the current point (x,, yn), the derivatives of g =fx and h =f, give
linear equations for the steps Ax and Ay. Then the next point x,. 1 = x, + Ax, y,, + =
y, + Ay comes from those steps. The input is (x,, y,), the output is the new point,
and the linear equations are
(gx)Ax + (gy)Ay = - g(xn,

y,)

(hx)Ax + (hy)Ay = - h(x,, y,)

or

(fxx)Ax + (fxy)Ay = -fx(xn, y,,)

(fxy)Ax + (fyy)Ay = -fy(Xn, y,).

(5)

When the second derivatives of f are available, use Newton's method.
When the problem is too complicated to go beyond first derivatives, here is an
alternative-steepestdescent. The goal is to move down the graph of f(x, y), like a
boulder rolling down a mountain. The steepest direction at any point is given by the
gradient, with a minus sign to go down instead of up. So move in the direction Ax =
- s af/ax and Ay = - s aflay.

13 Partial Derivatives

The question is: How far to move? Like a boulder, a steep start may not aim
directly toward the minimum. The stepsize s is monitored, to end the step when the
function f starts upward again (Problem 54). At the end of each step, compute first
derivatives and start again in the new steepest direction.

13.7 Constraints and Lagrange Multipliers
This section faces up to a practical problem. We often minimize one function f(x, y)
while another function g(x, y) is fixed. There is a constraint on x and y, given by
g(x, y) = k. This restricts the material available or the funds available or the energy
available. With this constraint, the problem is to do the best possible (f,, or fmin).
At the absolute minimum off(x, y), the requirement g(x, y) = k is probably violated.
In that case the minimum point is not allowed. We cannot use f, = 0 and f,, = Othose equations don't account for g.
Step 1 Find equations for the constrained minimum or constrained maximum. They
will involve f, andf,, and also g, and g,, which give local information about f and g.
To see the equations, look at two examples.
EXAMPLE 1 Minimize f = x2

+ y2 subject to the constraint g = 2x + y = k.

Trial runs The constraint allows x = 0, y = k, where f = k2. Also ($k, 0) satisfies the
constraint, and f = $k2 is smaller. Also x = y = $k gives f = $k2 (best so far).
Idea of solution Look at the level curves of f(x, y) in Figure 13.21. They are circles
x2 + y2 = C. When c is small, the circles do not touch the line 2x + y = k. There are
no points that satisfy the constraint, when c is too small. Now increase c.
Eventually the growing circles x2 + y2 = c will just touch the line x + 2y = k. The
point where they touch is the winner. It gives the smallest value of c that can be
achieved on the line. The touching point is (xmin,ymi,), and the value of c is fmin.
What equation describes that point? When the circle touches the line, they are
tangent. They have the same slope. The perpendiculars to the circle and he line go in
the same direction. That is the key fact, which you see in Figure 13.21a. The direction
perpendicular to f = c is given by grad f = (f,, f,). The direction perpendicular to g =
k is given by grad g = (g,, g,). The key equation says that those two vectors are
parallel. One gradient vector is a multiple of the other gradient vector, with a multiplier A (called lambda) that is unknown:

I

13N At the minimum of f(x, y) subject to gjx, y) = k, the gradient off is
parallel to the gradient of g-with an unknown number A as the multiplier:

Step 2 There are now three unknowns x, y, A. There are also three equations:

In the third equation, substitute 2A for 2x and fi. for y. Then 2x + y equals
equals k. Knowing = $k, go back to the first two equations for x, y, and fmin:

3).

The winning point (xmin,ymin)is ($k, f k). It minimizes the "distance squared,"
f = x2 + y2 = 3k2, from the origin to the line.

13.7 Constmints and Lagrange Muliipllen

Question What is the meaning of the Lagrange multiplier A?

Mysterious answer The derivative of *k2 is $k, which equals A. The multipler
A is the devivative of fmin with respect to k. Move the line by Ak, and fmin changes by
about AAk. Thus the Lagrange multiplier measures the sensitivity to k.
Pronounce his name "Lagronge" or better "Lagrongh" as if you are French.

EXAMPLE 2 Maximize and minimize f = x2 y2 on the ellipse g = (x -1)'

+ 44' = 4.

Idea and equations The circles x2 + y2 = c grow until they touch the ellipse. The
touching point is (x,,,, ymi,) and that smallest value of c is fmin. As the circles grow
they cut through the ellipse. Finally there is a point (x,,,, y,,,) where the last circle
touches. That largest value of c is f,,, .
The minimum and maximum are described by the same rule: the circle is tangent
to the ellipse (Figure 13.21b). The perpendiculars go in the same direction. Therefore
(fx, 4)is a multiple of (g,, gy), and the unknown multiplier is A:

a.

Solution The second equation allows two possibilities: y = 0 or A = Following up
y = 0, the last equation gives (x - 1)' = 4. Thus x = 3 or x = - 1. Then the first
equation gives A = 312 or A = 112. The values of f are x2 y2 = 3' + 0' = 9 and
~ ~ + ~ ~ = ( - 1 )1.~ + 0 ~ =
Now follow A = 114. The first equation yields x = - 113. Then the last equation
requires y2 = 5/9. Since x2 = 119 we find x2 y2 = 619 = 213. This is f,,,.

+

+

Conclusion The equations (3) have four solutions, at which the circle and ellipse
are tangent. The four points are (3, O), (- 1, O), (- 113, &3), and (- 113, -&3). The
four values off are 9, 1,3,3.
Summary The three equations are fx = Agx and fy = Ag,, and g = k. The unknowns
are x, y, and A. There is no absolute system for solving the equations (unless they are
linear; then use elimination or Cramer's Rule). Often the first two equations yield x
and y in terms of A, and substituting into g = k gives an equation for A.
At the minimum, the level curve f(x, y) = c is tangent to the constraint curve
g(x, y) = k. If that constraint curve is given parametrically by x(t) and y(t), then

13 Partial Derlvclthres

minimizing f(x(t), y(t)) uses the chain rule:
df - af dx
---dt ax dt

af dy = 0
+dy dt

or (grad f ) (tangent to curve) = 0.

This is the calculus proof that grad f is perpendicular to the curve. Thus grad f is
parallel to grad g. This means (fx , f,) = A(g, ,gy)We have lost f, = 0 and fy = 0. But a new function L has three zero derivatives:

I

130 The Lagrange function is y x , y, A) =f(x, y) - I(g(x, y) - k). Its three
derivatives are L, = L, = LA= 0 at the solution:

Note that dL/aA = 0 automatically produces g = k. The constraint is "built in" to L.
Lagrange has included a term A(g - k), which is destined to be zero-but its derivatives
are absolutely needed in the equations! At the solution, g = k and L = f and
a~/a=
k A.
What is important is fx = Ag, andf, = Agy,coming from L, = Ly = 0. In words: The
constraint g = k forces dg = g,dx + gydy= 0. This restricts the movements dx and dy.
They must keep to the curve. The equations say that df =fxdx +fydy is equal to Adg.
Thus df is zero in the aElowed direction-which is the key point.
MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM WITH TWO CONSTRAINTS

The whole subject of min(max)imization is called optimization. Its applications to
business decisions make up operations research. The special case of linear functions
is always important -in this part of mathematics it is called linear programming. A
book about those subjects won't fit inside a calculus book, but we can take one more
step-to allow a second constraint.
The function to minimize or maximize is now f(x, y, z). The constraints are
g(x, y, z) = k, and h(x, y, z) = k,. The multipliers are A, and A,. We need at least three
variables x, y, z because two constraints would completely determine x and y.
13P To minimizef(x, y, z) subject to g(x, y, z) = k, and h(x, y, z) = k2,solve five
equations for x, y, z, A,, 2,. Combine g = k, and h = k2 with

I

Figure 13.22a shows the geometry behind these equations. For convenience f is
x2 + y2 + z2, SO we are minimizing distance (squared). The constraints g = x + y + z =
9 and h = x + 2y + 32 = 20 are linear-their graphs are planes. The constraints keep
(x, y, z) on both planes-and therefore on the line where they meet. We are finding
the squared distance from (0, 0, 0) to a line.
What equation do we solve? The level surfaces x2 + y2 + z2 = c are spheres. They
grow as c increases. The first sphere to touch the line is tangent to it. That touching
point gives the solution (the smallest c). All three vectors gradf, grad g, grad h are
perpendicular to the line:
line tangent to sphere => grad f perpendicular to line
line in both planes

grad g and grad h perpendicular to line.

517

13.7 Constraints and Lagmnge Multipliers

Thus gradf, grad g, grad h are in the same plane-perpendicular to the line. With
three vectors in a plane, grad f is a combination of grad g and grad h:

This is the key equation (5). It applies to curved surfaces as well as planes.
EXAMPLE 3 Minimize x2

+ y2 + z2 when x + y + z = 9 and x + 2y + 32 = 20.

In Figure 13.22b, the normals to those planes are grad g = (1, 1, 1) and grad h =
(1, 2, 3). The gradient off = x2 + y2 + z2 is (2x, 2y, 22). The equations (5)-(6) are

+ z = 9 and h = 20:

After multiplying by 2, these simplify to 3A1 6A2 = 18 and 61, 14A2= 40. The
solutions are A, = 2 and A, = 2. Now the previous equations give (x, y, z) = (2,3,4).
The Lagrange function with two constraints is y x , y, z, A,, A,) =
f - A,(g - kl) - A2(h - k,). Its five derivatives are zero-those are our five equations.
Lagrange has increased the number of unknowns from 3 to 5, by adding A, and A,.
The best point (2, 3,4) gives f,, = 29. The 2 s give af/ak-the sensitivity to changes
in 9 and 20.

INEQUALITY CONSTRAINTS

In practice, applications involve inequalities as well as equations. The constraints
might be g < k and h 2 0. The first means: It is not required to use the whole resource
k, but you cannot use more. The second means: h measures a quantity that cannot
be negative. At the minimum point, the multipliers must satisfy the same inequalities:
R1 ,< 0 and A2 3 0.There are inequalities on the A's when there are inequalities in the
constraints.
Brief reasoning: With g < k the minimum can be on or inside the constraint curve.
Inside the curve, where g < k, we are free to move in all directions. The constraint is
not really constraining. This brings back f, = 0 and f,= 0 and 3, = 0-an ordinary
minimum. On the curve, where g = k constrains the minimum from going lower, we
have 1"< 0. We don't know in advance which to expect.

13 Partial Derivatives

For 100 constraints gi < k,, there are 100 A's. Some A's are zero (when gi < k,) and
some are nonzero (when gi = k,). It is those 2'' possibilities that make optimization
interesting. In linear programming with two variables, the constraints are x 0, y 0:
The constraint g = 4 is an equation, h and H yield inequalities. Each has its own
Lagrange multiplier-and the inequalities require A, 2 0 and A,> 0. The derivatives
off, g, h, H are no problem to compute:

Those equations make A, larger than A,. Therefore A, > 0, which means that the
constraint on H must be an equation. (Inequality for the multiplier means equality
for the constraint.) In other words H = y = 0. Then x + y = 4 leads to x = 4. The
solution is at (xmin,ymin)= (4, O), where fmin = 20.
At this minimum, h = x = 4 is above zero. The multiplier for the constraint h 2 0
must be A, = 0. Then the first equation gives 2, = 5. As always, the multiplier measures sensitivity. When g = 4 is increased by Ak, the cost fmin = 20 is increased by
5Ak. In economics 2, = 5 is called a shadow price-it is the cost of increasing the
constraint.
Behind this example is a nice problem in geometry. The constraint curve x + y = 4
is a line. The inequalities x 2 0 and y 2 0 leave a piece of that line-from P to Q in
Figure 13.23. The level curves f = 5x + 6y = c move out as c increases, until they
touch the line. Thefivst touching point is Q = (4, O), which is the solution. It is always
an endpoint-or a corner of the triangle PQR. It gives the smallest cost fmin,which
is c = 20.

13.7 Constmints and Lagrange Multipliers

To minimize f = x2 - y subject to g = x - y = 0, the three
equations for x, y, d are m . The solution is n . In this
example the curve f(x, y) =fmin = 0 is a P which is
q
to the line g = 0 at (xmin,ymin).
With two constraints g(x, y, z) = kl and h(x, y, z) = k2 there
are r multipliers. The five unknowns are s . The five
equations are f . The level surfacef =fmin is u to the
curve where g = k, and h = k2. Then gradf is v to this
curve, and so are grad g and w . Thus x is a combination of grad g and v . With nine variables and six constraints, there will be' 2 multipliers and eventually A
equations. If a constraint is an B g < k, then its multiplier
must satisfy A ,< 0 at a minimum.

prove the key formula dfmin/dk= A. But xmin,ymin,A, and fmin
all change with k. We need the total derivative of L(x, y, 1,k):

Equation (1) at the minimum point should now yield the
sensitivity formula dfmin/dk= 1.

gives a curve y = R(x). Then minimizing f(x, y) along this

14.1 Double Integrals

4

This chapter shows how to integrate functions of two or more variables. First, a
double integral is defined as the limit of sums. Second, we find a fast way to compute
it. The key idea is to replace a double integral by two ordinary "single" integrals.
The double integral f(x, y)dy dx starts with 1f(x, y)dy. For each fixed x we integrate with respect to y. The answer depends on x. Now integrate again, this time with
respect to x. The limits of integration need care and attention! Frequently those limits
on y and x are the hardest part.
Why bother with sums and limits in the first place? Two reasons. There has to be
a definition and a computation to fall back on, when the single integrals are difficult
or impossible. And also-this we emphasize-multiple integrals represent more than
area and volume. Those words and the pictures that go with them are the easiest to
understand. You can almost see the volume as a "sum of slices" or a "double sum of
thin sticks." The true applications are mostly to other things, but the central idea is
always the same: Add up small pieces and take limits.
We begin with the area of R and the volume of by double integrals.

Sf

A LIMIT OF SUMS

The graph of z =f(x, y) is a curved surface above the xy plane. At the point (x, y) in
the plane, the height of the surface is z. (The surface is above the xy plane only when
z is positive. Volumes below the plane come with minus signs, like areas below the
x axis.) We begin by choosing a positive function-for example z = 1 + x2 + y2.
The base of our solid is a region R in the xy plane. That region will be chopped
into small rectangles (sides Ax and Ay). When R itself is the rectangle 0 d x < 1,
0 < y < 2, the small pieces fit perfectly. For a triangle or a circle, the rectangles miss
part of R. But they do fit in the limit, and any region with a piecewise smooth
boundary will be acceptable.
Question What is the volume above R and below the graph of z =Ax, y)?
Answer It is a double integral-the integral of f(x, y) over R. To reach it we begin
with a sum, as suggested by Figure 14.1.

14 Multiple Integrals

area AA

Fig. 14.1 Base R cut into small pieces AA. Solid V cut into thin sticks AV

= z A A.

For single integrals, the interval [a, b] is divided into short pieces of length Ax.
For double integrals, R is divided into small rectangles of area AA = (Ax)(Ay). Above
the ith rectangle is a "thin stick" with small volume. That volume is the base area
AA times the height above it-except that this height z =f(x, y) varies from point to
point. Therefore we select a point (xi, y,) in the ith rectangle, and compute the volume
from the height above that point:
volume of one stick =f(xi, yi)AA

volume of all sticks =

1f(xi, yi)AA.

This is the crucial step for any integral-to see it as a sum of small pieces.
Now take limits: Ax -+ 0 and Ay 0. The height z =f(x, y) is nearly constant over
each rectangle. (We assume that f is a continuous function.) The sum approaches a
limit, which depends only on the base R and the surface above it. The limit is the
volume of the solid, and it is the double integral of f(x, y) over R:
-+

J JR

f(x, y) dA = lim

1f(xi, yi)AA.

A x -t 0
Ay+O

To repeat: The limit is the same for all choices of the rectangles and the points (xi, yi).
The rectangles will not fit exactly into R, if that base area is curved. The heights are
not exact, if the surface z =f(x, y) is also curved. But the errors on the sides and top,
where the pieces don't fit and the heights are wrong, approach zero. Those errors are
the volume of the "icing" around the solid, which gets thinner as Ax -+ 0 and Ay -+ 0.
A careful proof takes more space than we are willing to give. But the properties of
the integral need and deserve attention:
1. Linearity: jj(f + g)dA = jj f d~ + j j g dA
2. Constant comes outside: jj cf(x, y)dA = c jj f(x, y)dA
3. R splits into S and T(not overlapping): ]j f d~ = jj f d +~jj f d ~ .
R

S

T

In 1 the volume under f + g has two parts. The "thin sticks" of height f + g split into
thin sticks under f and under g. In 2 the whole volume is stretched upward by c. In
3 the volumes are side by side. As with single integrals, these properties help in
computations.
By writing dA, we allow shapes other than rectangles. Polar coordinates have an
extra factor r in dA = r dr do. By writing dx dy, we choose rectangular coordinates
and prepare for the splitting that comes now.

SPLITTING A DOUBLE INTEGRAL INTO TWO SINGLE INTEGRALS
The double integral JSf(x, y)dy dx will now be reduced to single integrals in y and
then x. (Or vice versa. Our first integral could equally well be ff(x, y)dx.) Chapter 8
described the same idea for solids of revolution. First came the area of a slice, which
is a single integral. Then came a second integral to add up the slices. For solids
formed by revolving a curve, all slices are circular disks-now we expect other shapes.
Figure 14.2 shows a slice of area A(x). It cuts through the solid at a fixed value of
x. The cut starts at y = c on one side of R, and ends at y = d on the other side. This
particular example goes from y = 0 to y = 2 (R is a rectangle). The area of a slice is
the y integral of f(x, y). Remember that x is fixed and y goes from c to d:
A(x) = area of slice =

This is the reverse of a partial derivative! The integral of x dy, with x constant, is
x 2y. This "partial integral" is actually called an inner integral.After substituting the
limits y = 2 and y = 0 and subtracting, we have the area A(x) = 2 + 2x 2 + 1. Now the

14 Multiple Integrals

The inner integrals are the cross-sectional areas A(x) and a(y) of the slices. The outer
integrals add up the volumes A(x)dx and a(y)dy. Notice the reversing of limits.
Normally the brackets in (2) are omitted. When the y integral is first, dy is written
inside dx. The limits on y are inside too. I strongly recommend that you compute the
inner integral on one line and the outer integral on a separate line.
EXAMPLE 2
triangle R.

Find the volume below the plane z = x - 2y and above the base

The triangle R has sides on the x and y axes and the line x + y = 1. The strips in the
y direction have varying lengths. (So do the strips in the x direction.) This is the main
point of the example-the base is not a rectangle. The upper limit on the inner
integral changes as x changes. The top of the triangle is at y = 1 - x.
Figure 14.3 shows the strips. The region should always be drawn (except for
rectangles). Without a figure the limits are hard to find. A sketch of R makes it easy:
y goes from c = 0 to d = 1 - x. Then x goes from a = 0 to b = 1.
The inner integral has variable limits and the outer integral has constant limits:

Solution Draw a figure! The inner integral goes from the parabola y = x2 up to
the straight line y = 2x. This gives vertical strips. The strips sit side by side between
x = 0 and x = 2. They stop where 2x equals x2, and the line meets the parabola.
The problem is to put the x integral first. It goes along horizontal strips. On each
line y = constant, we need the entry value of x and the exit value of x. From the figure,
Those are the inner limits. Pay attention also to the outer

14.2 Change to Better Coordinates
You don't go far with double integrals before wanting to change variables. Many
regions simply do not fit with the x and y axes. Two examples are in Figure 14.5,
a tilted square and a ring. Those are excellent shapes-in the right coordinates.

14 Multiple Integrals

We have to be able to answer basic questions like these:
Find the area

!.I

dA and moment

[.I

x dA and moment of inertia

SS

x2 dA.

The problem is: What is dA? We are leaving the xy variables where dA = dx dy.
The reason for changing is this: The limits of integration in the y direction are
miserable. I don't know them and I don't want to know them. For every x we would
need the entry point P of the line x = constant, and the exit point Q. The heights of
P and Q are the limits on Jdy, the inner integral. The geometry of the square and
ring are totally missed, if we stick rigidly to x and y.

Fig. 14.5 Unit square turned through angle a. Ring with radii 4 and 5.

Which coordinates are better? Any sensible person agrees that the area of the tilted
square is 1. "Just turn it and the area is obvious." But that sensible person may not
know the moment or the center of gravity or the moment of inertia. So we actually
have to do the turning.
The new coordinates u and v are in Figure 14.6a. The limits of integration on v are
0 and 1. So are the limits on u. But when you change variables, you don't just change
limits. Two other changes come with new variables:

1. The small area dA = dx dy becomes dA =
2. The integral of x becomes the integral of

du dv.

.

in a single integral, we make the same changes. Limits x = 0 and
Substituting u =
x = 4 become u = 0 and u = 2. Since x is u2, dx is 2u du. The purpose of the change
is to find an antiderivative. For double integrals, the usual purpose is to improve the
limits-but we have to accept the whole package.
To turn the square, there are formulas connecting x and y to u and 1.1. The geometry
is clear-rotate axes by x-but it has to be converted into algebra:

+ j. sin x
r = - s sin x + j9cos x

u = s cos x

x = u cos x

Figure 14.6 shows the rotation. As points move, the whole square turns. A good way
to remember equation (1) is to follow the corners as they become (1,O) and (0, 1).
du dl: is partly decided by equation (1). It
The change from JJ x dA to Jl
gives x as a function of u and v. We also need dA. For a pure rotation the first guess
is correct: The area dx dy equals the area du dv. For most changes of variable this is
false. The general formula for dA comes after the examples.

Similarly the integral of y leads to j. The answer is no mystery-the point (2, j ) is
at the center of the square! Substituting x = u cos a - v sin a made x dA look worse,
but the limits 0 and 1 are much better.
The moment of inertia I , around the y axis is also simplified:

You know this next fact but I will write it anyway: The answers don't contain u or v.
Those are dummy variables like x and y. The answers do contain a, because the
square has turned. (The area is fixed at 1.) The moment of inertia I, = jj y 2 dA is the
same as equation (3) but with all plus signs.

Question The sum I , I , simplifies to (a constant). Why no dependence on a?
Answer I , I , equals I,. This moment of inertia around (0,O) is unchanged by
rotation. We are turning the square around one of its corners.

CHANGE TO POLAR COORDINATES

The next change is to I. and 0. A small area becomes dA = r dr d0 (definitely not dr do).
Area always comes from multiplying two lengths, and d0 is not a length. Figure 14.7
shows the crucial region-a "polar rectangle" cut out by rays and circles. Its area
AA is found in two ways, both leading to r dr do:
(Approximate) The straight sides have length Ar. The circular arcs are
ci'ose to rA0. The angles are 90". So AA is close to (Ar)(rAO).
(Exact) A wedge has area ir2AB. The difference between wedges is AA:

The exact method places r dead center (see figure). The approximation says: Forget
the change in rAO as you move outward. Keep only the first-order terms.
A third method is coming, which requires no picture and no geometry. Calculus
always has a third method! The change of variables x = r cos 0, y = r sin 0 will go
into a general formula for dA, and out will come the area r dr dO.

The 0 integral is 27r (full circle). Actually the ring is a giant polar rectangle. We could
have used the exact formula r Ar AO, with AO = 27r and Ar = 5 - 4. When the radius
r is centered at 4.5, the product r Ar AO is (4.5)(1)(27r) = 97r as above.

14.2 Change to Better Coordinates
The first mass 7r/2 equals the area (because p = 1). The second mass 1r/6 is smaller
(because p < 1). Integrating p = 1 is the same as finding a volume when the height is
z = 1 (part of a cylinder). Integrating p = 1 - r is the same as finding a volume when

the height is z = 1 - r (part of a cone). Volumes of cones have the extra factor ½.
The center of gravity involves the moment Mx = JJyp dA. The distancefrom the
x axis is y, the mass of a small piece is p dA, integrate to add mass times distance.

Question Compare y for p = 1 and p = other positive constants and p = 1 - r.
Answer Any constant p gives 3 = 4/37r. Since 1 - r is dense at r = 0, j drops to 1/in.

Question How is Y= 4/37t related to the "average" of y in the semicircle?
Answer They are identical. This is the point of 3. Divide the integral by the area:

The average value of a function is Jf f(x, y)dA /

The integral off is divided by the integral of 1 (the area). In one dimension fa v(x) dx
was divided by fb 1 dx (the length b - a). That gave the average value of v(x) in

A is the area under a "bell-shaped curve"-see Figure 14.9. This is the most important
definite integral in the study of probability. It is difficult because a factor 2x is not
present. Integrating 2xe - X2 gives -e - X2, but integrating e-x 2 is impossible--except
approximately by a computer. How can we hope to show that A is exactly /-?
The trick is to go from an area integral A to a volume integral A2. This is unusual

CHANGE TO OTHER COORDINATES

A third method was promised, to find r dr d0 without a picture and without geometry.
The method works directly from x = r cos 0 and y = r sin 0 . It also finds the 1 in
du du, after a rotation of axes. Most important, this new method finds the factor J in
the area d A = J du dv, for any change of variables. The change is from xy to uv.
For single integrals, the "stretchingfactor" J between the original dx and the new
du is (not surprisingly) the ratio dxldu. Where we have dx, we write (dx/du)du.Where
we have (du/dx)dx, we write du. That was the idea of substitutions-the main way
to simplify integrals.
For double integrals the stretching factor appears in the area: dx d y becomes
IJI du do. The old and new variables are related by x = x(u, v) and y = y(u, 0 ) . The point
with coordinates u and v comes from the point with coordinates x and y. A whole
region S, full of points in the uu plane, comes from the region R full of corresponding
points in the xy plane. A small piece with area IJI du dv comes from a small piece with
area d x dy. The formula for J is a two-dimensional version of dxldu.

1

148 The stretching factor for area is the 2 by 2 Jacobian dktermiccnf J(u, v):

I An integral over R in the xy plane becomes an integral over S in the uv plane:
The determinant J is often written a(x, y)/d(u, v), as a reminder that this stretching
factor is like dxldu. W e require J # 0 . That keeps the stretching and shrinking under
control.
You naturally ask: Why take the absolute value IJI in equation (9)? Good
question-it wasn't done for single integrals. The reason is in the limits of integration.
The single integral dx is ' (- du) after changing x to - u. W e keep the minus sign
and allow single integrals to run backward. Double integrals could too, but normally
they go left to right and down to up. We use the absolute value IJI and run forward.

Why make this simple change, in which a, b, c, d are all constant? It straightens
parallelograms into squares (and rotates those squares). Figure 14.10 is typical.
Common sense indicated J = 1 for pure rotation-no change in area. Now J = 1
comes from equations (1) and (1I), because ad - bc is cos2a + sin2a.
' In pralctice, xy rectangles generally go into uv rectangles. The sides can be curved
(as in po~larrectangles) but the angles are often 90". The change is "orthogonal." The
next example has angles that are not 90°, and J still gives the answer.

Main point: The change to u and v makes the limits easy (just 0 and 3).
Why 1s the stretching factor J a determinant? With straight sides, this goes back to
Section 11.3 on vectors. The area of a parallelogram is a determinant. Here the sides
are curved, but that only produces ( d ~ and
) ~ ( d ~ )which
~ , we ignore.
A cha.nge du gives one side of Figure 14.11-it is (dxldu i + dyldu j)du. Side 2 is
(dxldv i -t dyldv j)dv. The curving comes from second derivatives. The area (the cross
product of the sides) is 1 J ldu dv.

14 Muttiple Integrals

Final remark I can't resist looking at the change in the reverse direction. Now the
rectangle is in xy and the parallelogram is in uu. In all formulas, exchange x for u

This is exactly like duldx = l/(dx/du).It is the derivative of the inverse function.
The product of slopes is 1-stretch out, shrink back. From xy to uv we have 2 by 2
matrices, and the identity matrix I takes the place of 1:

The first row times the first column is (ax/a~)(au/ax)
+ (ax/av)(av/ax)= axlax = 1.
The first row times the second column is ( d ~ / a ~ ) ( a ~+/(ax/a~)(av/dy)
dy)
= axlay = 0.
The matrices are inverses of each other. The determinants of a matrix and its inverse
obey our rule: old J times new J = 1. Those J's cannot be zero, just as dxldu and
duldx were not zero. (Inverse functions increase steadily or decrease steadily.)
In two dimensions, an area dx dy goes to J du dv and comes back to dx dy.

14 Mumple Integrals

14.3 Triple Integrals
At this point in the book, I feel I can speak to you directly. You can guess what triple

integrals are like. Instead of a small interval or a small rectangle, there is a small box.
Instead of length dx or area dx dy, the box has volume dV= dx dy dz. That is length
times width times height. The goal is to put small boxes together (by integration).
The main problem will be to discover the correct limits on x, y, z.
We could dream up more and more complicated regions in three-dimensional
space. But I don't think you can see the method clearly without seeing the region
clearly. In practice six shapes are the most important:
box

prism

cylinder

cone

sphere.

tetrahedron

The box is easiest and the sphere may be the hardest (but no problem in spherical

coordinates). Circular cylinders and cones fall in the middle, where xyz coordinates
are possible but rOz are the best. I start with the box and prism and xyz.

comes second):

f 2dy=6

and

S 2dy=6-6z.

y=-

After two integrations these are areas. The first area 6 is for a plane section through
the box. The second area 6 - 6z is cut through the prism. The shaded rectangle goes
from y = 0 to y = 3 - 3z-we needed and used the equation y + 3z = 3 for the boundary of the prism. At this point z is still constant! But the area depends on z, because
the prism gets thinner going upwards. The base area is 6 - 6z = 6, the top area is
6 - 6z = 0.
The outer integral multiplies those areas by dz, to give the volume of slices. They

are horizontal slices because z came last. Integration adds up the slices to find the
total volume:

The box volume 2 3 - 1 didn't need calculus. The prism is half of the box, so its
volume was sure to be 3-but it is satisfying to see how 6z - 3z2 gives the answer.

Question Find the prism volume in the order dz dy d x (six orders are possible).

To find those limits on the z integral, follow a line in the z direction. It enters
the prism at z = 0 and exits at the sloping face y + 32 = 3. That gives the upper limit
z = (3 - y)/3. It is the height of a thin stick as in Section 14.1. This section writes out
j dz for the height, but a quicker solution starts at the double integral.
What is the number 1 in the last integral? It is the area of a vertical slice, cut by a
plane x = constant. The outer integral adds up slices.

integral is the limit of
AV, a sum over small boxes of volume AV. Herefi is any
value of f(x, y, z) in the ith box. (In the limit, the boxes fit a curved region.) Now take
those boxes in a certain order. Put them into lines in the x direction and put the lines
of boxes into planes. The lines lead to the inner x integral, whose answer depends on
y and z. The y integral combines the lines into planes. Finally the outer integral
accounts for all planes and all boxes.
Example 2 is important because it displays more possibilities than a box or prism.

EXAMPLE 2

Find the volume of a tetrahedron (4-sided pyramid). Locate (2, j,5).

Solution A tetrahedron has four flat faces, all triangles. The fourth face in
Figure 14.13 is on the plane x y + z = 1. A line in the x direction enters at x = 0
and exits at x = 1 - y - z. (The length depends on y and z. The equation of the
boundary plane gives x.) Then those lines are put into plane slices by the y integral:

+

What is this number i(1 - z ) ~ I?t is the area at height z. The plane at that height
slices out a right triangle, whose legs have length 1 - z. The area is correct, but look
at the limits of integration. If x goes to 1 - y - z, why does y go to 1 - z? Reason:
We are assembling lines, not points. The figure shows a line at every y up to 1 - z.

Adding the slices gives the volume: t ( l - z)ldz = [&z - I)~]; = 9. This agrees
with $(base times height), the volume of a pyramid.
The height t of the centroid is "z,,~,,~." We compute rjr z dV and divide by the
volume. Each horizontal slice is multiplied by its height z, and the limits of integration
don't change:

This is quick because z is constant in the x and y integrals. Each triangular slice

reaches the line x + y = 1, the tetrahedron reaches the plane x + y + z = 1. The fourdimensional region stops at the hyperplane

EXAMPLE 3

Find the volume JjJ dx dy dz inside the unit sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 1.

First question: What are the limits on x? If a needle goes through the sphere in the
x direction, where does it enter and leave? Moving in the x direction, the numbers y
and z stay constant. The inner integral deals only with x. The smallest and largest x
are at the boundary where x2 + y2 + z2 = 1. This equation does the work-we solve
it for x. Look at the limits on the x integral:

d m

The limits on y are and + -/,.
You can use algebra on the boundary
equation x2 y2 z2 = 1. But notice that x is gone! We want the smallest and largest
y, for each z. It helps very much to draw the plane at height z, slicing through the
/,.
So the area is
sphere in Figure 14.14. The slice is a circle of radius r = =
xr2, which must come from the y integral:

+ +

I admit that I didn't integrate. Is it cheating to use the formula xr2? I don't think so.
Mathematics is hard enough, and we don't have to work blindfolded. The goal is
understanding, and if you know the area then use it. Of course the integral of
can be done if necessary-use Section 7.2.
The triple integral is down to a single integral. We went from one needle to a circle
of needles and now to a sphere of needles. The volume is a sum of slices of area
n(1 - z2). The South Pole is at z = - 1, the North Pole is at z = + 1, and the integral

The limits on x are now + 1 - y 2 /b 2 - z 2 /c 2 . The algebra looks terrible. The geometry is better-all slices are ellipses. A change of variable is absolutely the best.
Introduce u = x/a and v = y/b and w = z/c. Then the outer boundary becomes
u2 + v 2 + w2 = 1. In these new variables the shape is a sphere. The triple integral for
a sphere is fff du dv dw = 47r/3. But what volume dV in xyz space corresponds to a

small box with sides du and dv and dw?
Every uvw box comes from an xyz box. The box is stretched with no bending or
twisting. Since u is x/a, the length dx is a du. Similarly dy = b dv and dz = c dw. The
volume of the xyz box (Figure 14.14) is dx dy dz = (abc) du dv dw. The stretchingfactor

Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates

14.4 Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates

Cylindrical coordinates are good for describing solids that are symmetric around an
axis. The solid is three-dimensional, so there are three coordinates r, 0, z:
r: out from the axis

0: around the axis

z: along the axis.

This is a mixture of polar coordinates rO in a plane, plus z upward. You will not find
rOz difficult to work with. Start with a cylinder centered on the z axis:
solid cylinder: 0 < r < 1 flat bottom and top: 0 < z < 3 half-cylinder: 0

0 < 7E

Integration over this half-cylinder is J. f Jf ? dr dO dz. These limits on r, 0, z are
especially simple. Two other axially symmetric solids are almost as convenient:
cone: integrate to r + z = 1

sphere: integrate to r2 + z 2 = R 2

I would not use cylindrical coordinates for a box. Or a tetrahedron.
The integral needs one thing more-the volume dV. The movements dr and dO
and dz give a "curved box" in xyz space, drawn in Figure 14.15c. The base is a polar
rectangle, with area r dr dO. The new part is the height dz. The volume of the curved
box is r dr dO dz. Then r goes in the blank space in the triple integral-the stretching
factor is J = r. There are six orders of integration (we give two):

0 integral is 7rand the z integral is 3. The volume is 3xr/2.
EXAMPLE 2 The surface r = 1 - z encloses the cone in Figure 14.16. Find its volume.
First solution Since r goes out to 1 - z, the integral of r dr is ½(1 - z)2 . The 0 integral
is 27n (a full rotation). Stop there for a moment.
We have reached ff r dr dO = ½(1 - z)2 27r. This is the area of a slice at height z. The
slice is a circle, its radius is 1 - z, its area is 7r(1 - z)2. The z integral adds those slices
to give 7t/3. That is correct, but it is not the only way to compute the volume.

14 Mumple Integrals

Second solution Do the z and 8 integrals first. Since z goes up to 1 - r, and 8 goes
around to 2n, those integrals produce jj r dz d8 = r(l - r)2n. Stop again-this must
be the area of something.
After the z and 8 integrals we have a shell at radius r. The height is 1 - r (the outer
shells are shorter). This height times 2nr gives the area around the shell. The choice
betweeen shells and slices is exactly as in Chapter 8. Diflerent orders of integration
give dfferent ways to cut up the solid.
The volume of the shell is area times thickness dr. The volume of the complete
cone is the integral of shell volumes: r(1 - r)2n dr = 4 3 .

Third solution Do the r and z integrals first: jj r dr dz = Then the 8 integral is

The third cone is cut into wedges. The volume of a wedge is & dB. It is quite common
to do the 8 integral last, especially when it just multiplies by 271. It is not so common
to think of wedges.

Question Is the volume d8 equal to an area & times a thickness dB?
Answer No! The triangle in the third cone has area 9 not &. Thickness is never do.

Fig. 14.46 A cone cut three ways: slice at height z, shell at radius r, wedge at angle 0.

This cone is typical of a solid of revolution. The axis is in the z direction. The 8
integral yields 271, whether it comes first, second, or third. The r integral goes out to
a radius f(z), which is 1 for the cylinder and 1 - z for the cone. The integral r dr d8
is n ( f ( ~ ) )=~area of circular slice. This leaves the z integral jn(f(z))'dz. That is our

14.4 Cylindrical and Spherical Coordlnales

SPHERICAL COORDINATES

The Earth is a solid sphere (or near enough). On its surface we use two coordinateslatitude and longitude. To dig inward or fly outward, there is a third coordinatethe distance p from the center. This Greek letter rho replaces r to avoid confusion
with cylindrical coordinates. Where r is measured from the z axis, p is measured from
the origin. Thus r2 = x2 + y2 and p2 = x2 + y2 + z2.
The angle 8 is the same as before. It goes from 0 to 211. It is the longitude, which
increases as you travel east around the Equator.
The angle 4 is new. It equals 0 at the North Pole and n (not 2n) at the South Pole.
It is the polar angle, measured down from the z axis. The Equator has a latitude of
0 but a polar angle of n/2 (halfway down). Here are some typical shapes:

The angle 4 is constant on a cone from the origin. It cuts the surface in a circle

center p = 0 and moving out to p = R.

Question What is the volume above the cone in Figure l4.l7?
Answer The 4 integral stops at [- cos 41:'~ = i. The volume is (4R3)(+)(2n).
EXAMPLE 7 The surface area of a sphere is A = 47rR2. Forget the p integral:

After those examples from geometry, here is the real thing from science. I want to
compute one of the most important triple integrals in physics-"the
gravitational
attraction of a solid sphere." For some reason Isaac Newton had trouble with this
integral. He refused to publish his masterpiece on astronomy until he had solved it.
I think he didn't use spherical coordinates-and the integral is not easy even now.
The answer that Newton finally found is beautiful. The sphere acts as if all its mass
were concentrated at the center. At an outside point (O,0, D), the force of gravity is
proportional to 1/D2. The force from a uniform solid sphere equals the force from a
point mass, at every outside point P. That is exactly what Newton wanted and
needed, to explain the solar system and to prove Kepler's laws.
Here is the difficulty. Some parts of the sphere are closer than D, some parts are
farther away. The actual distance q, from the outside point P to a typical inside point,
is shown in Figure 14.18. The average distance q to all points in the sphere is not D.
But what Newton needed was a different average, and by good luck or some divine
calculus it works perfectly: The average of l/q is 1/D. This gives the potential energy:
potential at point P

=

1j 1 q1 d V = volume Dof sphere
-

sphere

A small volume d V at the distance q contributes d V/y to the potential (Section 8.6,
with density 1). The integral adds the contributions from the whole sphere. Equation
(2) says that the potential at r = D is not changed when the sphere is squeezed to
the center. The potential equals the whole volume divided by the single distance D.
Important point: The average of l/q is 1/D and not l/q. The average of i and is
not 3. Smaller point: I wrote "sphere" where I should have written "ball." The
sphere is solid: 0 < p < R, 0 < q5 < n,0 < 8 < 2n.
What about the force? For the small volume it is proportional to d v/q2 (this is the
inverse square law). But force is a vector, pulling the outside point toward dV-not
toward the center of the sphere. The figure shows the geometry and the symmetry.
We want the z component of the force. (By symmetry the overall x and y components
are zero.) The angle between the force vector and the z axis is a, so for the z component
we multiply by cos a. The total force comes from the integral that Newton discovered:
cos x

force at point P = jjj -dV=

one time only Isaac Newton could do. Problem 26 offers a suggestion (just the law
of cosines) but the integral is yours.
The law of cosines also helps with (2). For the triangle in the figure it gives q2 =
D2 - 2pD cos 4 + p2. Call this whole quantity u. We do the surface integral first
(d) and dB with p fixed). Then q2 = u and q =
and du = 2pD sin 4 d):

&

271 came from the 0 integral. The integral of du/& is 2&. Since cos 4 = - 1 at the
upper limit, u is D2 + 2pD + P2. The square root of u is D + p. At the lower limit
cos ) = + 1 and u = D2 - 2pD + p2. This is another perfect square-its square root
is D - p. The surface integral (4) with fixed p is

4 n p 2 d p / =4aR3/D.
~
This proves formula (2):
Last comes the p integral:
potential equals volume of the sphere divided by D.
Note 1 Physicists are also happy about equation (5). The average of l/q is 1/D not
only over the solid sphere but over each spherical shell of area 4ap2. The shells can
have different densities, as they do in the Earth, and still Newton is correct. This also
applies to the force integral (3)-each separate shell acts as if its mass were concentrated at the center. Then the final p integral yields this property for the solid sphere.
Note 2 Physicists also know that force is minus the derivative of potential. The
derivative of (2) with respect to D produces the force integral (3). Problem 27 explains
this shortcut to equation (3).
EXAMPLE 8 Everywhere inside a hollow sphere the force of gravity is zero.

&

When D is smaller than p, the lower limit
in the integral (4) changes from D - p
to p - D. That way the square root stays positive. This changes the answer in (5) to
4np2/p, so the potential no longer depends on D. The potential is constant inside the
hollow shell. Since the force comes from its derivative, the force is zero.
A more intuitive proof is in the second figure. The infinitesimal areas on the surface
are proportional to q2 and Q ~But
. the distances to those areas are q and Q, so the

14 Multiple Integrals

forces involve l/q2 and l/Q2 (the inverse square law). Therefore the two areas exert
equal and opposite forces on the inside point, and they cancel each other. The total
force from the shell is zero.
I believe this zero integral is the reason that the inside of a car is safe from lightning.
Of course a car is not a sphere. But electric charge distributes itself to keep the surface
at constant potential. The potential stays constant inside-therefore no force. The
tires help to prevent conduction of current (and electrocution of driver).
P.S. Don't just step out of the car. Let a metal chain conduct the charge to the
ground. Otherwise you could be the conductor.
CHANGE OF COORDINATES-STRETCHING

FACTOR J

Once more we look to calculus for a formula. We need the volume of a small curved
box in any uvw coordinate system. The r8z box and the p4B box have right angles,
and their volumes were read off from the geometry (stretching factors J = r and J =
p2 sin 4 in Figures 14.15 and 14.17). Now we change from xyz to other coordinates
uvw-which are chosen to fit the problem.
Going from xy to uv, the area dA = J du dv was a 2 by 2 determinant. In three
dimensions the determinant is 3 by 3. The matrix is always the "Jacobian matrix,"
containing first derivatives. There were four derivatives from xy to uv, now there are
nine from xyz to uuw.
I4C Suppose x, y, z are given in terms of u, v, w. Then a small faax in uuw
space (sides du, dv, dw) comes from a volume d V = J dtc dv dw in xyz space:

I The volume integral Ijl dx d y dz becomes fljIJI du dv dw, with limits on uvw.
Remember that a 3 by 3 determinant is the sum of six terms (Section 113 . One term
in J is (ax/du)(dy/dv)(dz/i3w),along the main diagonal. This comes from pure stretching, and the other five terms allow for rotation. The best way to exhibit the formula
is for spherical coordinates-where the nine derivatives are easy but the determinant
is not:

p2sin34 sin28and p2sin34cos28. Add the first two (note sin28+ cos28)and separately
add the second two. Then add the sums to reach J = p2sin (6.

Vector Calculus

Chapter 14 introduced double and triple integrals. We went from dx to jj dx dy and

JIJdx dy dz. All those integrals add up small pieces, and the limit gives area or volume
or mass. What could be more natural than that? I regret to say, after the success of
those multiple integrals, that something is missing. It is even more regrettable that
we didn't notice it. The missing piece is nothing less than the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus.
The double integral dx dy equals the area. To compute it, we did not use an
antiderivative of 1. At least not consciously. The method was almost trial and error,
and the hard part was to find the limits of integration. This chapter goes deeper, to
show how the step from a double integral to a single integral is really a new form of
the Fundamental Theorem-when it is done right.

11

Two new ideas are needed early, one pleasant and one not. You will like vector
fields. You may not think so highly of line integrals. Those are ordinary single integrals
like J v(x)dx, but they go along curves instead of straight lines. The nice step dx
becomes the confusing step ds. Where Jdx equals the length of the interval, J ds is
the length of the curve. The point is that regions are enclosed by curves, and we have
to integrate along them. The Fundamental Theorem in its two-dimensional form
(Green's Theorem) connects a double integral over the region to a single integral along
its boundary curve.
The great applications are in science and engineering, where vector fields are so
natural. But there are changes in the language. Instead of an antiderivative, we speak
about a potential function. Instead of the derivative, we take the "divergence" and
"curl." Instead of area, we compute flux and circulation and work. Examples come
first.

15.1 Vector Fields 1

-

For an ordinary scalar function, the input is a number x and the output is a number
f(x). For a vector field (or vector function), the input is a point (x, y) and the output
is a two-dimensional vector F(x, y). There is a "field" of vectors, one at every point.

549

15 Vector Calculus

In three dimensions the input point is (x, y, z) and the output vector F has three
components.
DEFINITION Let R be a region in the xy plane. A vectorfield F assigns to every point
(x, y) in R a vector F(x, y) with two components:

+

F(x, y) = M(x, y)i N(x, y)j.
(1)
This plane vector field involves two functions of two variables. They are the components M and N, which vary from point to point. A vector has fixed components, a
vector field has varying components.
A three-dimensional vector field has components M(x, y, z) and N(x, y, z) and
P(x, y, 2). Then the vectors are F = Mi + Nj + Pk.
EXAMPLE 1 The position vector at (x, y) is R = xi + yj. Its components are M = x
and N = y. The vectors grow larger as we leave the origin (Figure 15.la). Their
direction is outward and their length is IRI = J;i?;i = r, The vector R is boldface,
the number r is lightface.
EXAMPLE 2 The vector field R/r consists of unit vectors u,, pointing outward. We
divide R = xi + yj by its length, at every point except the origin. The components
~ , length
of Rlr are M = xlr and N = y/r. Figure 15.1 shows a third field ~ / r whose
is 1/r.

Fig. 15.1 The vector fields R and R/r and R/r2 are radial. Lengths r and 1 and l / r

EXAMPLE 3 The spin field or rotation field or turning field goes around the origin
instead of away from it. The field is S. Its components are M = - y and N = x:

S = - yi + xj also has length IS1 = J(-y)2
S is perpendicular to R-their dot product is zero: S
spin fields S/r and S/r2 have lengths 1 and llr:

+ x2 = r.
(2)
R = (- y)(x) + (x)(y)= 0. The

The unit vector S/r is u,. Notice the blank at (O,O), where this field is not defined.

Fig. 15.2 The spin fields S and S/r and S/r2 go around the origin. Lengths r and 1 and l/r.

15.1 Vector Fields

A gradientfield starts with an ordinary functionf (x, y). The components
M and PJ are the partial derivatives df/dx and dfldy. Then the field F is the gradient
off:
F = grad f = Vf = dfldx i + dfldy j.
(3)

EXAMPLE 4

This vector field grad f is everywhere perpendicular to the level curves f(x, y) = c. The
length lgrad f 1 tells how fast f is changing (in the direction it changes fastest). Invent
a function like f = x2y, and you immediately have its gradient field F = 2xyi + x2j.
To repealt, M is df/dx and N is dfldy.
For every vector field you should ask two questions: Is it a gradient field? If so,
what is f? Here are answers for the radial fields and spin fields:
M A The radial fields R and R/r and ~ / arer a11~gradient fields.
The spin fields S and S/r are not gradients of anyf (x, y),
The spin field S/r2 is the gradient of the polar angle 0 = tan- '(ylx).

+

The derivatives off = f(x2 y2) are x and y. Thus R is a gradient field. The gradient
off = r is the unit vector R/r pointing outwards. Both fields are perpendicular to
circles around the origin. Those are the level curves off = f r2 and f = r.
Question Is every R/rn a gradient field?
Answer Yes. But among the spin fields, the only gradient is S/r2.

A ma-jor goal of this chapter is to recognize gradient fields by a simple test. The
rejection of S and S/r will be interesting. For some reason -yi + xj is rejected and
.) The acceptance of S/r2 as the
yi + xj is accepted. (It is the gradient of
gradient off = 0 contains a surprise at the origin (Section 15.3).
Gradient fields are called conservative. The function f is the potential function.
These words, and the next examples, come from physics and engineering.
EXAMPLE 5

The velocity field is V and the flow field is pV.

Suppose: fluid moves steadily down a pipe. Or a river flows smoothly (no waterfall).
Or the air circulates in a fixed pattern. The velocity can be different at different points,
but there is no change with time. The velocity vector V gives the direction offlow
and speed of Jow at every point.
In reality the velocity field is V(x, y, z), with three components M, N, P. Those are
the velocities v,, v2, v, in the x, y, z directions. The speed (VI is the length: IVI2 =
v: + v: -t v:. In a "plane flow" the k component is zero, and the velocity field is
v , i + v 2 j = M i + Nj.

F = - R//."
Fig. 15.3 A steady velocity field V and two force fields F.

15 Vector Calculus

For a compact disc or a turning wheel, V is a spin field (V = US, co = angular
velocity). A tornado might be closer to V = S/r2 (except for a dead spot at the center).
An explosion could have V = R/r2. A quieter example is flow in and out of a lake
with steady rain as a source term.
TheJlowJield pV is the density p times the velocity field. While V gives the rate of
movement, pV gives the rate of movement of mass. A greater density means a greater
rate IpVJof "mass transport." It is like the number of passengers on a bus times the
speed of the bus.
EXAMPLE 6 Force fields from gravity: F is downward in the classroom, F is radial
in space.

When gravity pulls downward, it has only one nonzero component: F = - mgk. This
assumes that vectors to the center of the Earth are parallel-almost true in a classroom. Then F is the gradient of - mgz (note dfldz = - mg).
In physics the usual potential is not - mgz but + mgz. The force field is minus grad f
also in electrical engineering. Electrons flow from high potential to low potential.
The mathematics is the same, but the sign is reversed.
In space, the force is radial inwards: F = - mMGR/r3. Its magnitude is proportional to l/r2 (Newton's inverse square law). The masses are m and M, and the
gravitational constant is G = 6.672 x 10-"--with distance in meters, mass in kilograms, and time in seconds. The dimensions of G are (force)(di~tance)~/(mass)~.
This
is different from the acceleration g = 9.8m/sec2, which already accounts for the mass
and radius of the Earth.
Like all radial fields, gravity is a gradient field. It comes from a potential f:

EXAMPLE 7 (a short example) Current in a wire produces a magnetic field B. It is
the spin field S/r2 around the wire, times the strength of the current.
STREAMLINES AND LINES OF FORCE

Drawing a vector field is not always easy. Even the spin field looks messy when the
vectors are too long (they go in circles and fall across each other). The circles give a
clearer picture than the vectors. In any field, the vectors are tangent to "jield lineswwhich in the spin case are circles.
DEFINITION C is afield line or integral curve if the vectors F(x, y) are tangent to C.
The slope dyldx of the curve C equals the slope N/M of the vector F = Mi Nj:

+

We are still drawing the field of vectors, but now they are infinitesimally short.
They are connected into curves! What is lost is their length, because S and S/r and
S/r2 all have the same field lines (circles). For the position field R and gravity field
R/r3, the field lines are rays from the origin. In this case the "curves" are actually
straight.
EXAMPLE 8 Show that the field lines for the velocity field V = yi + xj are hyperbolas.

reamlines x 2 - y 2 = C

Fig. 15.4 Velocity fields are tangent to streamlines. Gradient fields also have equipotentials.

At every point these hyperbolas line up with the velocity V. Each particle of fluid
travels on afield line. In fluid flow those hyperbolas are called streamlines. Drop a
leaf into a river, and it follows a streamline. Figure 15.4 shows the streamlines for a
river going around a bend.
Don't forget the essential question about each vector field. Is it a gradient field?
For V = yi + xj the answer is yes, and the potential is f = xy:
the gradient of xy is (8flax)i + (8flay)j = yi + xj.

(7)

When there is a potential, it has level curves. They connect points of equal potential,
so the curves f (x, y) = c are called equipotentials. Here they are the curves xy = calso hyperbolas. Since gradients are perpendicular to level curves, the streamlines are
perpendicular to the equipotentials. Figure 15.4 is sliced one way by streamlines and
the other way by equipotentials.

+

A gradient field F = afldx i afldy j is tangent to the field lines (streamlines) and perpendicular to the equipotentials (level curves off).
In the gradient direction f changes fastest. In the level direction f doesn't change at
all. The chain rule along f (x, y) = c proves these directions to be perpendicular:

EXAMPLE 9 The streamlines of S/r2 are circles around (0,O). The equipotentials are
rays 0 = c. Add rays to Figure 15.2 for the gradient field S/r2.

For the gravity field those are reversed. A body is pulled in along the field lines (rays).
The equipotentials are the circles where f = l l r is constant. The plane is crisscrossed
by "orthogonal trajectories9'-curves that meet everywhere at right angles.
If you bring a magnet near a pile of iron filings, a little shake will display the field
lines. In a force field, they are "lines of force." Here are the other new words.

15.2 Line Integrals

.-

A line integral is an integral along a curve. It can equal an area, but that is a special
case and not typical. Instead of area, here are two important line integrals in physics
and engineering:
Work along a curve =

F T ds

Flow across a curve =

In the first integral, F is a force field. In the second integral, F is a flow field. Work
is done in the direction of movement, so we integrate F T. Flow is measured through
the curve C, so we integrate F n. Here T is the unit tangent vector, and F T is the
force cornponent along the curve. Similarly n is the unit normal vector, at right angles
with T. Then F n is the component of flow perpendicular to the curve.
We will write those integrals in several forms. They may never be as comfortable
as J y(x) dx, but eventually we get them under control. I mention these applications
early, so you can see where we are going. This section concentrates on work, and
flow comes later. (It is also calledflux-the Latin word for flow.) You recognize ds
as the step along the curve, corresponding to dx on the x axis. Where f dx gives the
length of an interval (it equals b - a), ds is the length of the curve.

EXAMPLE 1 Flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles on a straight line and a semicircle.

According to Delta Airlines, the distance straight west is 2000 miles. Atlanta is at
(1000,O) and Los Angeles is at (-1000, O), with the origin halfway between. The
semicircle route C has radius 1000. This is not a great circle route. It is more of a
"flat circle," which goes north past Chicago. No plane could fly it (it probably goes
into space).
The equation for the semicircle is x2 + y 2 = 10002. Parametrically this path is x =
1000 cos t, y = 1000 sin t. For a line integral the parameter is better. The plane leaves
Atlanta at t = 0 and reaches L.A. at t = n, more than three hours later. On the straight
2000-mile path, Delta could almost do it. Around the semicircle C, the distance is
lOOOn miles and the speed has to be 1000 miles per hour. Remember that speed is
distance ds divided by time dt:

+

dsldt = ,/(dx~dt)~ (dyldt)' = l000,/(-

+

sin t)2 (cos t)2 = 1000.

(1)
The tangent vector to C is proportional to (dxldt, dyldt) = (-1000 sin t, 1000 cos t).
But T is a unit vector, so we divide by 1000-which is the speed.
Suppose the wind blows due east with force F = Mi. The components are M and
zero. Foir M =constant, compute the dot product F * Tand the work -2000 M:
F w T =Mi*(-sin t i + c o s t j ) = M(-sin t)+O(cos t ) = - M sin t

15 Vector Calculus

Work is force times distance moved. It is negative, because the wind acts against the
movement. You may point out that the work could have been found more simplygo 2000 miles and multiply by - M. I would object that this straight route is a
dzrerent path. But you claim that the path doesn't matter-the work of the wind is
-2000M on every path. I concede that this time you are right (but not always).
Most line integrals depend on the path. Those that don't are crucially important.
For a gradient field, we only need to know the starting point P and the finish Q.
158 When F is the gradient of a potential function f (x, y), the work J, F T ds
depends only on the endpoints P and Q. The work is the change in$

if F = afpx i + af/ay j then

F T ds =f (Q) -f(P).

When F = Mi, its components M and zero are the partial derivatives off = Mx. To
compute the line integral, just evaluate f at the endpoints. Atlanta has x = 1000, Los
Angeles has x = - 1000, and the potential function f = Mx is like an antiderivative:
work =f (Q) -f (P) = M(- 1000) - M(1000) = - 2000M.

May I give a rough explanation of the work integral F T ds? It becomes clearer
when the small movement Tds is written as dx i + dy j. The work is the dot product
with F:

5

The infinitesimal work is df: The total work is df= f(Q) -f (P).This is the Fundamental Theoremfor a line integral. Only one warning: When F is not the gradient of any
f (Example 2), the Theorem does not apply.
EXAMPLE 2

Fly these paths against the non-constant force field F = Myi. Compute

the work.
There is no force on the straight path where y = 0. Along the x axis the wind does
no work. But the semicircle goes up where y = 1000 sin t and the wind is strong:
F * T = ( M y i ) * ( - s i n t i + c o s t j ) = -My sin t =

lOOOM sin2t

This work is enormous (and unrealistic). But the calculations make an important
point-everything is converted to the parameter t. The second point is that F = Myi
is not a gradient field. First reason: The work was zero on the straight path and

15.2 Line Integrals

nonzero on the semicircle. Second reason: No function has df/ dx = My and df /dy =
0. (The first makes f depend on y and the second forbids it. This F is called a shear
force.) Without a potential we cannot substitute P and Q-and the work depends
on the path.
THE DEFINITION OF LINE INTEGRALS

We go back to the start, to define F T ds. We can think of F T as a function g(x, y)
along the path, and define its integral as a limit of sums:

IC

N

g ( ~y)
, ds = limit of
i= 1

&xi, yi)Asi as (As),,,.,

-i

0.

(5)

The points (xi, y,) lie on the curve C. The last point Q is (x,, y,); the first point P is
(xo, yo). The step Asi is the distance to (xi, yi) from the previous point. As the steps
get small (As -,0) the straight pieces follow the curve. Exactly as in Section 8.2, the
special case g = 1 gives the arc length. As long as g(x, y) is piecewise continuous
(jumps allowed) and the path is piecewise smooth (corners allowed), the limit exists
and defines the line integral.
When g is the density of a wire, the line integral is the total mass. When g is F T,
the integral is the work. But nobody does the calculation by formula (5). We now
introduce a parameter t-which could be the time, or the arc length s, or the distance
x along the base.
The diflerential ds becomes (ds/dt)dt. Everything changes over to t:

The curve starts when t = a, runs through the points (x(t), y(t)), and ends when t = b.
The square root in the integral is the speed dsldt. In three dimensions the points on
C are (x(t), y(t), z(t)) and (dz/dt)l is in the square root.
EXAMPLE 3 The points on a coil spring are (x, y, z) = (cos t, sin t, t). Find the mass
of two complete turns (from t = 0 to t = 4 4 if the density is p = 4.

+

Solution The key is ( d ~ / d t+
) ~( d ~ / d t+
) ~( d ~ l d t=
) ~sin2t + cos2t 1 = 2. Thus
To find the mass, integrate the mass per unit length which is g = p = 4:
dsldt =

fi.

That is a line integral in three-dimensional space. It shows how to introduce t. But
it misses the main point of this section, because it contains no vector field F. This
section is about work, not just mass.
DIFFERENT FORMS OF THE WORK INTEGRAL

The work integral I F T ds can be written in a better way. The force is F = Mi + Nj.
A small step along the curve is dx i + dy j. Work is force times distance, but it is only
the force component along the path that counts. The dot product F - T d s finds that
component automatically.

15 Vector Calculus

15C The vector to a point on C is R = xi

The product M dx is (force in x direction)(movement in x direction). This is zero if
either factor is zero. When the only force is gravity, pushing a piano takes no work.
It is friction that hurts. Carrying the piano up the stairs brings in Pdz, and the total
work is the piano weight P times the change in z.
To connect the new I F dR with the old I F * Tds, remember the tangent vector
T. It is dRlds. ~herefoieTds is dR. The best for computations is dR, because the
unit vector T has a division by dsldt = , / ( d ~ / d t )+

EXAMPLE 4 Vector field F = - yi + xj, path from (1,O) to (0, 1): Find the work.

Note 1 This F is the spin field S. It goes around the origin, while R = xi + yj goes
outward. Their dot product is F R = - yx + xy = 0. This does not mean that
F dR = 0. The force is perpendicular to R, but not to the change in R. The work to
move from (I, 0) to (0, I), x axis to y axis, is not zero.
Note 2 We have not described the path C. That must be done. The spin field is not
a gradient field, and the work along a straight line does not equal the work on a
quarter-circle:

quarter-circle x = cos t, y = sin t.

straight line x = 1 - t, y = t

15.2 Llne Integrals

For practice, take the path down the x axis to the origin (x = 1 - t, y = 0). Then
go up the y axis (x = 0, y = t - 1).The starting time at (1,O) is t = 0. The turning time
at the origin is t = 1. The finishing time at (0, 1) is t = 2. The integral has two parts
because this new path has two parts:
Bent path: J - y d x + x d y = O + O

(y=O on one part, then x=O).

Note 3 The answer depended on the path, for this spin field F = S. The answer did
not depend on the choice of parameter. If we follow the same path at a different
speed, the work is the same. We can choose another parameter 2, since (ds/dt)dt and
(ds/dz)dz both equal ds. Traveling twice as fast on the straight path (x = 1 - 22,
y = 22) we finish at t = 4 instead of t = 1. The work is still 1:

CONSERVNION OF TOTAL ENERGY (KINETIC + POTENTIAL)

When a force field does work on a mass m, it normally gives that mass a new velocity.
Newton's Law is F =ma = mdvldt. (It is a vector law. Why write out three components?) The work F dR is

J (m dvldt) (v dt) = *mv

v:]

= $mv(Q)12- $mlv(P)12.

The work equals the change in the kinetic energy 4mlv12. But for a gradient field the
work is also the change in potential-with a minus sign from physics:

Comparing (8) with (9), the combination $m1vl2 +f is the same at P and Q. The total
energy, kinetic plus potential, is conserved.
INDEPENDENCE OF PATH: GRADIENT FIELDS

The work of the spin field S depends on the path. Example 4 took three pathsstraight line, quarter-circle, bent line. The work was 1, 4 2 , and 0, different on each
path. This happens for more than 99.99% of all vector fields. It does not happen for
the most important fields. Mathematics and physics concentrate on very special
fields-for which the work depends only on the endpoints. We now explain what
happens, when the integral is independent of the path.
Suppose you integrate from P to Q on one path, and back to P on another path.
Combined, that is a closed path from P to P (Figure 15.7). But a backward integral
is the negative of a forward integral, since dR switches sign. If the integrals from P
to Q are equal, the integral around the closed path is zero:

closed

path 1

back path 2

path 2

The circle on the first integral indicates a closed path. Later we will drop the P's.
Not all closed path integrals are zero! For most fields F, different paths yield
different work. For "conservative" fields, all paths yield the same work. Then zero

15 Vector Calculus

work around a closed path conserves energy. The big question is: How to decide
which fields are conservative, without trying all paths? Here is the crucial information
about conservative fields, in a plane region R with no holes:

+

15D F = M(x, y)i N ( x , y)j is a conservative field if it has these properties:
A. The work J F dR around every closed path is zero.
B. The work F d R depends only on P and Q, not on the path.
C. F is a gradient field: M = df/ax and N = df/dy for some potential f ( x , y).
D. The components satisfy dM/ay = (3Nldx.

A field with one of these properties has them all. D is the quick test.
These statements A-D bring everything together for conservative fields (alias gradient
fields). A closed path goes one way to Q and back the other way to P. The work
cancels, and statements A and B are equivalent. We now connect them to C. Note:
Test D says that the "curl" of F is zero. That can wait for Green's Theorem in the
next section-the full discussion of the curl comes in 15.6.
First, a gradient field F = grad f is conservative. The work is f (Q) -f (P), by the
fundamental theorem for line integrals. It depends only on the endpoints and not the
path. Therefore statement C leads back to B.
Our job is in the other direction, to show that conservative fields Mi + Nj are
gradients. Assume that the work integral depends only on the endpoints. We must
construct a potentialf, so that F is its gradient. In other words, dfldx must be M and
dfldy must be N.
Fix the point P. Define f (Q) as the work to reach Q. Then F equals grad&

Check the reasoning. At the starting point P, f is zero. At every other point Q, f is
the work J M dx + N dy to reach that point. Allpathshsfom P to Q give the same f(Q),
because the field is assumed conservative. After two examples we prove that grad f
agrees with F-the construction succeeds.

af/dx = 2xy gives f = x2y (plus any function of y).

In this example x2y already has the correct derivative dfldy = x2. No additional
function of y is necessary. When we integrate with respect to x, the constant of
integration (usually C ) becomes a function C(y).
You will get practice in finding f. This is only possible for conservative fields! I

Aitempted solution 3 Directly solve dfldx = - y and try to fix up af/dy = x :

af/dx = - y gives f = - x y (plus any function C(y)).

The y derivative of this f is - x + dC/dy. That does not agree with the required
dfldy = x. Conclusion: The spin field -yi + xj is not conservative. There is no f.
Test D gives dM/dy = - 1 and dN/dx = + 1.
To finish this section, we move from examples to a proof. The potential f(Q) is
defined as the work to reach Q. We must show that its partial derivatives are M and
N. This seems reasonable from the formula f (Q)= M d x N dy, but we have to
think it through.
Remember statement A, that all paths give the same f(Q). Take a path that goes
from P to the left of Q. It comes in to Q on a line y = constant (so dy = 0). As the
path reaches Q, we are only integrating M dx. The derivative of this integral, at Q, is
df/ax = M. That is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
To show that af/ay = N, take a different path. G o from P to a point below Q. The
path comes up to Q on a vertical line (so d x = 0). Near Q we are only integrating
N dy, so i?f/dy = N.
The requirement that the region must have no holes will be critical for test D.

15.3 Green's Theorem
This section contains the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, extended to two dimensions. That sounds important and it is. The formula was discovered 150 years after
Newton and Leibniz, by an ordinary mortal named George Green. His theorem
connects a double integral over a region R to a line integral along its boundary C .
The integral of dfldx equals f(b) -f (a). This connects a one-dimensional integral
to a zero-dimensional integral. The boundary only contains two points a and b! The
answerf (b) -f (a) is some kind of a "point integral." It is this absolutely crucial ideato integrate a derivative from information at the boundary-that Green's Theorem
extends into two dimensions.

I

I

There are two important integrals around C. The work is F T ds = M dx + N dy.
The flux is 1F n ds = M dy - N dx (notice the switch). The first is for a force field,
the second is for a flow field. The tangent vector T turns 90" clockwise to become
the normal vector n. Green's Theorem handles both, in two dimensions. In three
dimensions they split into the Divergence Theorem (15.5) and Stokes' Theorem (15.6).
Green's Theorem applies to "smooth" functions M(x, y) and N(x, y), with continuous first derivatives in a region slightly bigger than R. Then all integrals are well
defined. M and N will have a definite and specific meaning in each application-to
electricity or magnetism or fluid flow or mechanics. The purpose of a theorem is to
capture the central ideas once and for all. We do that now, and the applications
follow.

1SE Green's TIreorm Suppose the region R is bounded by the simple
closed piecewise smooth curve C. Thm an integral over R equals a line integral

around C:

A curve is "simple" if it doesn't cross itself (figure 8's are excluded). It is "closed" if
its endpoint Q is the same as its starting point P. This is indicated by the closed circle
on the integral sign. The curve is "smooth" if its tangent T changes continuouslythe word "piecewise" allows a finite number of corners. Fractals are not allowed, but
all reasonable curves are acceptable (later we discuss figure 8's and rings). First comes
an understanding of the formula, by testing it on special cases.

dy = ff1 dx dy (which is the area of R).

(2)

The integrals look equal, because the inner integral of dx is x. Then both integrals
have x dy-but we need to go carefully. The area of a layer of R is dy times the
difference in x (the length of the strip). The line integral in Figure 15.8 agrees. It has
an upward dy times x (at the right) plus a downward -dy times x (at the left). The
integrals add up the strips, to give the total area.
Special case 2: M = y and N = 0 and fc y dx = fR(-1) dx dy= -(area of R).

Now Green's formula has a minus sign, because the line integral is counterclockwise.
The top of each slice has dx < 0 (going left) and the bottom has dx > 0 (going right).
Then y dx at the top and bottom combine to give minus the area of the slice in
Figure 15.8b.
Specialcase 3: f 1 dx = 0. The dx's to the right cancel the dx's to the left (the curve
is closed). With M = 1 and N = 0, Green's Theorem is 0 = 0.
Most important case: Mi + Nj is a gradientfield. It has a potential function f(x, y).
Green's Theorem is 0 = 0, because aMlay = aN/ax. This is test D:
My Oy (axa is the same as ax

ey /y y Fx

=

Ox ax

(3)

The cross derivatives always satisfy f,y =fx,. That is why gradient fields pass test D.
When the double integral is zero, the line integral is also zero: fc M dx + N dy = 0.
The work is zero. The field is conservative! This last step in A => B => C => D = A will
be complete when Green's Theorem is proved.
Conservative examples are fx dx = 0 and f y dy = 0. Area is not involved.
Remark The special cases x dy and - ydx led to the area of R. As long as
1 = aN/ax - aM/ay, the double integral becomes ff 1 dx dy. This gives a way to compute area by a line integral.
The area ofR is

(x dy - ydx).

On the other side, the line integral has three pieces.

2dy = 2.

The area of an ellipse is nrab when the semiaxes have lengths a and b.

This is a classical example, which all authors like. The points on the ellipse are
x = a cos t, y = b sin t, as t goes from 0 to 21r. (The ellipse has (x/a)2 + (y/b)2 = 1.)
By computing the boundary integral, we discover the area inside. Note that the
differential x dy - y dx is just ab dt:
(a cos t)(b cos t dt) - (b sin t)(- a sin t dt) = ab(cos2t + sin 2 t)dt = ab dt.
The line integral is

_o2

ab dt = 7nab. This area nab is 7rr 2, for a circle with a = b = r.

Proof of Green's Theorem: In our special cases, the two sides of the formula were
equal. We now show that they are always equal. The proof uses the Fundamental
Theorem to integrate (aN/ax)dx and (aM/dy)dy. Frankly speaking, this one-dimensional theorem is all we have to work with-since we don't know M and N.
The proof is a step up in mathematics, to work with symbols M and N instead of
specific functions. The integral in (6) below has no numbers. The idea is to deal with
M and N in two separate parts, which added together give Green's Theorem:

Start with a "very simple" region (Figure 15.10a). Its top is given by y =f(x) and
its bottom by y = g(x). In the double integral, integrate - aM/ay first with respect to
y. The inner integral is

The Fundamental Theorem (in the y variable) gives this answer that depends on x.
If we knew M and f and g, we could do the outer integral-from x = a to x = b. But
we have to leave it and go to the other side of Green's Theorem-the line integral:

Very simple region (a-b). Simple region (c) is a union of very simple regions.

Compare (7)with (6). The integral of M(x, g(x)) is the same for both. The integral of
M(x,f(x)) has a minus sign from (6). In (7)it has a plus sign but the integral is from
b to a. So life is good.
The part for N uses the same idea. Now the x integral comes first, because
(0N/ax)dx is practically asking to be integrated-from x = G(y) at the left to x = F(y)
at the right. We reach N(F(y), y) - N(G(y), y). Then the y integral matches § Ndy and

completes (5). Adding the two parts of (5) proves Green's Theorem.
Finally we discuss the shape of R. The broken ring in Figure 15.10 is not "very
simple," because horizontal lines go in and out and in and out. Vertical lines do the
same. The x and y strips break into pieces. Our reasoning assumed no break between
y =f(x) at the top and y = g(x) at the bottom.

There is a nice idea that saves Green's Theorem. Separate the broken ring into
three very simple regions R 1, R2 , R 3 . The three double integrals equal the three line
integrals around the R's. Now add these separate results, to produce the double

integral over all of R. When we add the line integrals, the crosscuts CC are covered
twice and they cancel. The cut between R 1 and R 2 is covered upward (around R 1 )
and downward (around R 2). That leaves the integral around the boundary equal to
the double integral inside-which is Green's Theorem.
When R is a complete ring, including the piece R 4 , the theorem is still true. The
integral around the outside is still counterclockwise. But the integral is clockwise
around the inner circle. Keep the region R to your left as you go around C. The

complete ring is "doubly" connected, not "simply" connected. Green's Theorem
allows any finite number of regions Ri and crosscuts CC and holes.
EXAMPLE 3 The area under a curve is jb y dx, as we always believed.
In computing area we never noticed the whole boundary. The true area is a line
integral - y dx around the closed curve in Figure 15.11 a. But y = 0 on the x axis.
Also dx = 0 on the vertical lines (up and down at b and a). Those parts contribute
zero to the integral of y dx. The only nonzero part is back along the curve-which
is the area - a y dx or I' y dx that we know well.
What about signs, when the curve dips below the x axis? That area has been
counted as negative since Chapter 1. I saved the proof for Chapter 15. The reason
lies in the arrows on C.
The line integral around that part goes the other way. The arrows are clockwise,
the region is on the right, and the area counts as negative. With the correct rules, a
figure 8 is allowed after all.

Closed path gives the sign of the area. Nonconservative field because of hole.
CONSERVATIVE FIELDS

We never leave gradients alone! They give conservative fields-the work around a
closed path is f(P)-f(P) = 0. But a potential function f(x, y) is only available when
test D is passed: If Of/ax = M and af/Oy = N then dM/ly = aN/ax. The reason is that

fxy =fx .

Some applications prefer the language of "differentials." Instead of looking for
f(x, y), we look for df:
DEFINITION

The expression M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy is a differential form. When it

agrees with the differential df= (df/Ox)dx + (f/aOy) dy of some function, the form
is called exact. The test for an exact differential is D: ON/Ox = OM/ay.
Nothing is new but the language. Is y dx an exact differential? No, because My = 1
and Nx = 0. Is y dx + x dy an exact differential? Yes, it is the differential of f= xy.
That is the product rule! Now comes an important example, to show why R should
be simply connected (a region with no holes).

The extra part C(y) can be zero--the y derivative of tan- '(y/x) gives N with no help
from C(y). The potentialfis the angle 0 in the usual x, y, r right triangle.
Test D is passed and F is grad 0. What am I worried about? It is only this,
that Green's Theorem on a circle seems to give 27r = 0. The double integral is
ff (Nx - My)dx dy. According to (8) this is the integral of zero. But the line integral is
27r:

F* dR = (- y dx + x dy)/(x 2 + y 2)= 2(area of circle)/a 2 = 2ra 2/a 2 = 27.

(9)

With x = a cos t and y = a sin t we would find the same answer. The work is 27r (not
zero!) when the path goes around the origin.
We have a paradox. If Green's Theorem is wrong, calculus is in deep trouble. Some
requirement must be violated to reach 27t = 0. Looking at S/r 2 , the problem is at the
origin. The field is not defined when r = 0 (it blows up). The derivatives in (8) are not
continuous. Test D does not apply at the origin, and was not passed. We could remove
(0, 0), but then the region where test D is passed would have a hole.

15 Vector Calculus

It is amazing how one point can change everything. When the path circles the
origin, the line integral is not zero. The potential function f = 8 increases by 27r. That
agrees with F d R = 27r from (9). It disagrees with I10 dx dy. The 27r is right, the zero
is wrong. Nx - My must be a "delta function of strength 2n."
The double integral is 27r from an infinite spike over the origin-even though N, =
My everywhere else. In fluid flow the delta function is a ''vortex."

FLOW ACROSS A CURVE: GREEN'S THEOREM TURNED BY 90"

A flow field is easier to visualize than a force field, because something is really there
and it moves. Instead of gravity in empty space, water has velocity M(x, y)i + N(x, y)j.
At the boundary C it can flow in or out. The new form of Green's Theorem is a
fundamental "balance equation" of applied mathematics:
Flow through C (out minus in) = replacement in R (source minus sink).

The flow is steady. Whatever goes out through C must be replaced in R. When there
are no sources or sinks (negative sources), the total flow through C must be zero.
This balance law is Green's Theorem in its "normal form" (for n) instead of its
"tangential form" (for T):
C

15F For a steady flow field F = M(x, y)i + N(x, y)j, the flux 1F n ds through
the boundary C balances the replacement of fluid inside R:

Figure 15.12 shows the 90" turn. T becomes n and "circulation" along C becomes
flux through C. In the original form of Green's Theorem, change N and M to M and
- N to obtain the flux form:

Playing with letters has proved a new theorem! The two left sides in (11) are equal,
so the right sides are equal-which is Green's Theorem (10) for the flux. The components M and N can be chosen freely and named freely.
The change takes Mi + Nj into its perpendicular field - Ni + Mj. The field is turned
at every point (we are not just turning the plane by 90"). The spin field S = - yi + xj
changes to the position field R = xi + yj. The position field R changes to -S. Streamlines of one field are equipotentials of the other field. The new form (10) of Green's

15.3 Green's Theorem
Theorem is just as important as the old one-in fact I like it better. It is easier to
visualize flow across a curve than circulation along it.
The change of letters was just for the proof. From now on F = Mi + Nj.
EXAMPLE 5 Compute both sides of the new form (10) for F = 2xi + 3yj. The region
R is a rectangle with sides a and b.
Solution This field has dM/ax + ON/ly = 2 + 3. The integral over R is f, 5 dx dy =
5ab. The line integral has four parts, because R has four sides. Between the left and
right sides, M = 2x increases by 2a. Down the left and up the right, fM dy = 2ab
(those sides have length b). Similarly N = 3y changes by 3b between the bottom and
top. Those sides have length a, so they contribute 3ab to a total line integral of 5ab.
Important: The "divergence" of a flow field is aM/ax + aNlay. The example has
divergence = 5. To maintain this flow we must replace 5 units continually-not just
at the origin but everywhere. (A one-point source is in example 7.) The divergence is
the source strength, because it equals the outflow. To understand Green's Theorem
for any vector field Mi + Nj, look at a tiny rectangle (sides dx and dy):
Flow out the right side minus flow in the left side = (change in M) times dy
Flow out the top minus flow in the bottom = (change in N) times dx
Total flow out of rectangle: dM dy + dN dx = (aM/ax + aN/ay)dx dy.
The divergence times the area dx dy equals the total flow out. Section 15.5 gives more
detail with more care in three dimensions. The divergence is Mx + N, + PZ.

Mx + N, = 2 + 3 = 5 yields flux = 5(area) = 5ab. The flux is dM dy + dN dx=

(Mx + NY) dx dy. The spin field has no flux.

EXAMPLE 6 Find the flux through a closed curve C of the spin field S = - yi + xj.
Solution The field has M = - y and N = x and Mx + N, = 0. The double integral is
zero. Therefore the total flow (out minus in) is also zero-through any closed curve.
Figure 15.13 shows flow entering and leaving a square. No fluid is added or removed.
There is no rain and no evaporation. When the divergence Mx + N, is zero, there is
no source or sink.
FLOW FIELDS WITHOUT SOURCES
This is really quite important. Remember that conservative fields do no work around
C, they have a potential f, and they have "zero curl." Now turn those statements
through 90', to find their twins. Source-freefields have no flux through C, they have
stream functions g, and they have "zero divergence." The new statements E-F-G-H
describe fields without sources.

569

15 Vector Calculus

156 The field F = M(x, y)i + N(x, y)j is source-free if it has these properties:
E The total flux f F n ds through every closed curve is zero.
F Across all curves from P to Q, the ffux F n ds is the same.
G There is a stream function g(x, y), for which M = ag/dy and N = - agfax.
H The components satisfy aM/ax + aN/ay = 0 (the divergence is zero).
A field with one of these properties has them all. H is the quick test.

r:

The spin field -yi + xj passed this test (Example 6 was source-free). The field
2xi 3yj does not pass (Example 5 had M, + N, = 5). Example 7 almost passes.

They add to zero. There seems to be no source (if the calculation is correct). The flow
through a circle x2 + y2 = a' should be zero. But it's not:

A source is hidden somewhere. Looking at R/r2, the problem is at (0,O). The field is
not defined when r = 0 (it blows up). The derivatives in (12) are not continuous. Test
H does not apply, and was not passed. The divergence M, N, must be a "delta
function" of strength 211. There is' a point source sending flow out through all circles.
I hope you see the analogy with Example 4,. The field S/r2is curl-free except at r = 0.
The field R/r2 is divergence-free except at r = 0. The mathematics is parallel and the
fields are perpendicular. A potential f and a stream function g require a region without
holes.

+

THE BEST FIELDS: CONSERVATIVE AND SOURCE-FREE

What if F is conservative and also source-free? Those are outstandingly important
fields. The curl is zero and the divergence is zero. Because the field is conservative, it
comes from a potential. Because it is source-free, there is a stream function:

Those are the Cauchy-Riemann equations, named after a great mathematician of his
time and one of the greatest of all time. I can't end without an example.
EXAMPLE 8 Show that yi

+ xj is both conservative and source-free. Find f and g.

Solution With M = y and N = x, check first that i?M/dy = 1 = dN/Zx. There must
be a potential function. It is f = xy, which achieves af/ax = y and i?f/ay = x. Note
that fxx +A, = 0.
Check next that dM/dx + aN/dy = 0 + 0. There must be a stream function. It is
g = f (y2 - x2), which achieves dg/ay = y aild dg/i?x = - x. Note that g,, + g,, = 0.

15.3 Green's Theorem

The curves f = constant are the equipotentials. The curves g = constant are the
streamlines (Figure 15.4). These are the twin properties-a conservative field with
a potential and a source-free field with a stream function. They come together into
the fundamental partial differential equation of equilibrium-Laplace's equation
f x x +&y = 0.

ISH There is a potential and stream function when My= Nx and Mx = - Ny.
They satisfy LaplhceJse 4 ~ i m :
and

f,+f,=M,+Ny=O

(15)

g,+gyy=-Nx+My=O.

If we have f without g, as in f = x2 + y2 and M = 2x and N = 2y, we don't have
Laplace's equation: f,+fyy =4. This is a gradient field that needs a source.
If we have g without f; as in g = x2 y2 and M = 2y and N = - 2x, we don't have
Laplace's equation. The field is source-free but it has spin. The first field is 2R and
the second field is 2s.
With no source and no spin, we are with Laplace at the center of mathematics and
science.

inside R can be squeezed to a point without leaving R. Test
these regions:

15.4 Surface Integrals
The double integral in Green's Theorem is over a flat surface R. Now the region
moves out of the plane. It becomes a curved surface S, part of a sphere or cylinder
or cone. When the surface has only one z for each (x, y), it is the graph of a function
z(x, y). In other cases S can twist and close up-a sphere has an upper z and a lower
z. In all cases we want to compute area and flux. This is a necessary step (it is our
last step) before moving Green's Theorem to three dimensions.

(on surfaces). The first is in xyz coordinates; the second uses parameters. Before this
subject gets complicated, I will explain those two methods.
Method 1 is for the graph of a function: curve y(x) or surface z(x, y).

A small piece of the curve is almost straight. It goes across by dx and up by dy:

length ds = J

= ,/i+(dyldx)2

dx.

(1)
A small piece of the surface is practically flat. Think of a tiny sloping rectangle. One
side goes across by dx and up by (dz/dx)dx. The neighboring side goes along by dy
and up by (az/dy)dy. Computing the area is a linear problem (from Chapter 1I),
because the flat piece is in a plane.
Two vectors A and B form a parallelogram. The length of their cross product is the
area. In the present case, the vectors are A = i (az/ax)k and B = j + (az/ay)k. Then
Adx and Bdy are the sides of the small piece, and we compute A x B:

+

This is exactly the normal vector N to the tangent plane and the surface, from
Chapter 13. Please note: The small flat piece is actually a parallelogram (not always

a rectangle). Its area dS is much like ds, but the length of N = A x B involves two
derivatives:
area dS = IAdx x Bdyl = INIdx dy =

1 + (az/ax)2 + (z/aOy)

dx dy.

EXAMPLE 1 Find the area on the plane z = x + 2y above a base area A.
This is the example to visualize. The area down in the xy plane is A. The area up on
the sloping plane is greater than A. A roof has more area than the room underneath
it. If the roof goes up at a 450 angle, the ratio is 2/.Formula (3) yields the correct
ratio for any surface--including our plane z = x + 2y.

Roof area = base area times |NI. Cone and cylinder with parameters u and v.

The derivatives are dz/dx = 1 and az/ay = 2. They are constant (planes are easy).
The square root in (3)contains 1 + 12 + 22 = 6. Therefore dS = 6 dx dy. An area in
the xy plane is multiplied by 6 up in the surface (Figure 15.14a). The vectors A and
B are no longer needed-their work was done when we reached formula (3)-but
here they are:
A=i+(az/ax)k=i+k B=j+(az/ay)k=j+2k

N= -i-2j+k.

6. The angle between k and N has cos 0 = 1/ 6. That
is the angle between base plane and sloping plane. Therefore the sloping area is 6
times the base area. For curved surfaces the idea is the same, except that the square
root in INI = 1/cos 0 changes as we move around the surface.
The length of N = A x B is

Method 2 isfor curves x(t), y(t) and surfaces x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) with parameters.
A curve has one parameter t. A surface has two parameters u and v (it is twodimensional). One advantage of parameters is that x, y, z get equal treatment, instead
of picking out z as f(x, y). Here are the first two examples:
cone x = u cos v, y = u sin v, z = u

cylinder x = cos v, y = sin v, z = u.

(4)

Each choice of u and v gives a point on the surface. By making all choices, we get
the complete surface. Notice that a parameter can equal a coordinate, as in z = u.
Sometimes both parameters are coordinates, as in x = u and y = v and z =f(u, v).
That is just z =f(x, y) in disguise-the surface without parameters. In other cases we
find the xyz equation by eliminating u and v:

The cone is the graph off =.-/,
The cylinder is not the graph of any function.
There is; a line of z's through each point on the circle x2 y2 = 1. That is what z =
u tells us: Give u all values, and you get the whole line. Give u and v all values, and
you get the whole cylinder. Parameters allow a surface to close up and even go
through itself-which the graph of f(x, y) can never do.
gives only the top half of the cone. (A function produces
Actually z =
only one z.) The parametric form gives the bottom half also. Similarly y = ,/gives only the top of a circle, while x = cos t, y = sin t goes all the way around.
Now we find dS, using parameters. Small movements give a piece of the surface,
practica.11~flat. One side comes from the change du, the neighboring side comes from
dv. The two sides are given by small vectors Adu and Bdv:

Find A and B and N = A x B and dS for the cone and cylinder.

The cone has x = u cos v, y = u sin v, z = u. The u derivatives produce A = dR/du =
cos v i -I- sin v j + k. The v derivatives produce the other tangent vector B = aR/dv =
- u s i n v i + u c o s v j . The normal vector is A x B = - u c o s v i - u s i n v j + u k . Its
length gives dS:
~ S = I xABI dudv=J(u

The cylinder is even simpler: dS = du dv. In these and many other examples, A is
perpendicular to B. The small piece is a rectangle. Its sides have length IAl du and
the cylinder has IAl= IBI = 1). The cross

product is hardly needed for area, when we can just multiply IAl du times IBldv.

Remark on the two methods Method 1 also used parameters, but a very special
choice--u is x and v is y. The parametric equations are x = x, y = y, z =f(x, y). If
you go through the long square root in (7), changing u to x and v to y, it simplifies
to the s'quare root in (3). (The terms dy/dx and axlay are zero; axldx and dyldy are
1.) Still it pays to remember the shorter formula from Method 1.
Don't forget that after computing dS, you have to integrate it. Many times the
is with polar coordinates. Surfaces are often symmetric around an axis or
good
a point. Those are the surfaces of revolution-which we saw in Chapter 8 and will
come back to.
Strictly speaking, the integral starts with AS (not dS). A flat piece has area
[A x BlAxAy or [A x BlAuAv. The area of a curved surface is properly defined as a
limit. The key step of calculus, from sums of AS to the integral of dS, is safe for

576

smooth surfaces. In examples, the hard part is computing the double integral and
substituting the limits on x, y or u, v.
EXAMPLE 3

Find the surface area of the cone z =

x 2 + y2 up to the height z = a.

We use Method 1 (no parameters). The derivatives of z are computed, squared, and

Conclusion: INI = /2 and dS = /2 dx dy. The cone is on a 450 slope, so the area

dx dy in the base is multiplied by 2 in the surface above it (Figure 15.15). The
square root in dS accounts for the extra area due to slope. A horizontal surface has
dS = 1 dx dy, as we have known all year.
Now for a key point. The integrationis down in the baseplane. The limits on x and
2

y are given by the "shadow" of the cone. To locate that shadow set z = x/x
2

equal to z = a. The plane cuts the cone at the circle x + y = a . We integrate over

the inside of that circle (where the shadow is):

Find the same area using dS = /2 u du dv from Example 2.

EXAMPLE 4

With parameters, dS looks different and the shadow in the base looks different. The
circle x 2 + y 2 = a2 becomes u2 cos 2v + u2 sin 2v = a2. In other words u = a. (The cone
has z = u, the plane has z = a, they meet when u = a.) The angle parameter v goes

from 0 to 27x. The effect of these parameters is to switch us "automatically" to polar
coordinates, where area is r dr dO:

EXAMPLE 5

Find the area of the same cone up to the sloping plane z = 1 -

x.

Solution The cone still has dS = 2 dx dy, but the limits of integration are changed.
The plane cuts the cone in an ellipse. Its shadow down in the xy plane is another
ellipse (Figure 15.15c). To find the edge of the shadow, set z = x 2 + y 2 equal to z =
1 - x. We square both sides:

y2 =

!(x +

This is the ellipse in the base-where height makes no difference and z is gone. The
area of an ellipse is nab, when the equation is in the form (xla)' (y/b)2= 1. After
multiplying by 314 we find a = 413 and b = $@. Then jJ$ dx dy = $nab is the
surface area of the cone.
The hard part was finding the shadow ellipse (I went quickly). Its area nab came
from Example 15.3.2. The new part is
from the slope.

EXAMPLE 6

Find the surface area of a sphere of radius a (known to be 4na2).

This is a good example, because both methods almost work. The equation of the
sphere is x2 + y2 + z2 = a2. Method 1 writes z =.-/,,
The x and y derivatives are - x/z and - ylz:

Notice that z is gone (as it should

be). Nolw integrate dS over the shadow of the sphere, which is a circle. Instead of
dx dy, switch to polar coordinates and r dr d6:
- - 2na
shadow

J-1:

= 2na2.

This calculation is successful but wrong. 2na2 is the area of the half-sphere above the
xy plane. The lower half takes the negative square root of z2 = a2 - x2 - y2. This
shows t'he danger of Method 1, when the surface is not the graph of a function.
EXAMPLE 7 (same sphere by Method 2: use parameters) The natural choice is spherical coordinates. Every point has an angle u = # down from the North Pole and an
angle v = 6 around the equator. The xyz coordinates from Section 14.4 are x =
a sin # cos 6, y = a sin # sin 6, z = a cos #. The radius p = a is fixed (not a parameter).
Compute the first term in equation (6)' noting dz/d6 = 0:

(dy/d#)(az/aO) - (az/a#)(ay/a6) = - (-a sin #)(a sin

# cos 6) = a2 sin24 cos 6.

The other terms in (6) are a2 sin2# sin 6 and a2 sin # cos #. Then dS in equation (7)
squares these three components and adds. We factor out a4 and simplify:

Conclusion: dS = a2 sin # d# dB. A spherical person will recognize this immediately.
It is the volume element dV = p2 sin # dp d# dB, except dp is missing. The small box
has area dS and thickness dp and volume dK Here we only want dS:

Figure 15.16a shows a small surface with sides a d# and a sin # d6. Their product is

I doubt that you will like Figure 15.16~-and you don't need it. With parameters
# and 8,the shadow of the sphere is a rectangle. The equator is the line down the
middle, where # = 4 2 . The height is z = a cos #. The area d# d6 in the base is the

don't halve to know about parameters.

EXAMPLE 8 Rotate y = x 2 around the x axis. Find the surface area using parameters.
The first parameter is x (from a to b). The second parameter is the rotation angle 0
(from 0 to 27r). The points on the surface in Figure 15.17 are x = x, y = x 2 cos 0,
z = x 2 sin 0. Equation (7)leads after much calculation to dS = x 2 /1 4x2 dx dO.
Main point: dS agrees with Section 8.3, where the area was S 2nty 1 + (dy/dx)2 dx.
The 2rr comes from the 0 integral and y is x 2. Parameters give this formula automatically.
VECTOR FIELDS AND THE INTEGRAL OF F n
Formulas for surface area are dominated by square roots. There is a square root in
dS, as there was in ds. Areas are like arc lengths, one dimension up. The good point
about line integrals IJF -nds is that the square root disappears. It isin the denominator
of n, where ds cancels it: F *nds = M dy - N dx. The same good thing will now
happen for surface integrals JfF . ndS.

This formula tells what to integrate, given the surface and the vector field (f and F).

For the unit normal vector n, divide N by its length: n = N/INI. The square root is in
the denominator, and the same square root is in dS. See equation (3):

F ndS =

(11)

That is formula (10), with cancellation of square roots. The expression F . ndS is often
written as F . dS, again relying on boldface to make dS a vector. Then dS equals ndS,
with direction n and magnitude dS.

areas are different, but flux is like rain. Whether it hits a tent or the ground below,
it is the same rain (Figure 15.18). In this case JJ F ndS = 51d x dy = shadow area in
the base.

The zero comes as a surprise, but it shouldn't. The cone goes straight out from the
origin, and so does F. The vector n that is perpendicular to the cone is also perpendicular to F. There is no flow through the cone, because F n = 0. The flow travels out
along rays.

F O R A SURFACE WITH PARAMETERS

In Example 10 the cone was z =f(x, y) = Jx2 + y2. We found dS by Method 1.
Parameters were not needed (more exactly, they were x and y). For surfaces that fold
and twist, the formulas with u and v look complicated but the actual calculations can
be simpler. This was certainly the case for dS = dudv on the cylinder.
A small piece of surface has area dS = IA x BI du dv. The vectors along the sides are
A = xui + yuj + z,k and B = xvi y,j zvk. They are tangent to the surface. Now we
put their cross product N = A x B to another use, because F ndS involves not only
area but direction. We need the unit vector n to see how much flow goes through.
The direction vector is n = N/INI. Equation (7)is dS = lNldu dv, so the square root
IN1 cancels in ndS. This leaves a nice formula for the "normal component" of flow:

F n is + z = b at the top and -z = 0 at the bottom. The bottom flux is zero, the top
flux is b times the area (or nb). The total flux is 2nb + nb = 3nb. Hold that answer

15.4 Surface Integrals

I have to mention one more problem. It might not occur to a reasonable person, but
sometimes a surface has only one side. The famous example is the Miibius strip, for
which you take a strip of paper, twist it once, and tape the ends together. Its special
property appears when you run a pen along the "inside." The pen in Figure 15.20
suddenly goes "outside." After another round trip it goes back "inside." Those words
are in quotation marks, because on a Mdbius strip they have no meaning.
Suppose the pen represents the normal vector. On a sphere n points outward.
Alternatively n could point inward; we are free to choose. But the M6bius strip makes
the choice impossible. After moving the pen continuously, it comes back in the
opposite direction. This surface is not orientable. We cannot integrate F *n to compute
the flux, because we cannot decide the direction of n.
A surface is oriented when we can and do choose n. This uses the final property of
cross products, that they have length and direction and also a right-hand rule. We
can tell A x B from B x A. Those give the two orientations of n. For an open surface
(like a wastebasket) you can select either one. For a closed surface (like a sphere) it
is conventional for n to be outward. By making that decision once and for all, the
sign of the flux is established: outwardflux is positive.

smooth vector field) now becomes the great three-dimensional balance equationthe Divergence Theorem:

In Green's Theorem the divergence was dM/dx + dN/dy. The new term dP/dz
accounts for upward flow. Notice that a constant upward component P adds nothing
to the divergence (its derivative is zero). It also adds nothing to the flux (flow up
through the top equals flow up through the bottom). When the whole field F is
constant, the theorem becomes 0 = 0.
There are other vector fields with div F = 0. They are of the greatest importance.
The Divergence Theorem for those fields is again 0 = 0, and there is conservation of
fluid. When div F = 0, flow in equals flow out. We begin with examples of these
"divergence-free" fields.
EXAMPLE 1 The spin fields -yi

+ xj + Ok and Oi - zj + yk have zero divergence.

The first is an old friend, spinning around the z axis. The second is new, spinning
around the x axis. Three-dimensional flow has a great variety of spin fields. The
separate terms dM/dx, dN/dy, dP/az are all zero, so div F = 0. The flow goes around
in circles, and whatever goes out through S comes back in. (We might have put a
as we did on $c, to emphasize that S is closed.)

EXAMPLE 2 The position field R = xi

+ yj + zk has div R = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

This is radial flow, straight out from the origin. Mass has to be added at every point
to keep the flow going. On the right side of the divergence theorem is [[[3 dl/.
Therefore the flux is three times the volume.
Example 11 in Section 15.4 found the flux of R through a cylinder. The answer
was 3nb. Now we also get 3nb from the Divergence Theorem, since the volume is nb.
This is one of many cases in which the triple integral is easier than the double integral.
EXAMPLE 3 An electrostatic field R/p3 or gravity field - R/p3 almost has div F = 0.

The vector R = xi + yj + zk has length
= p. Then F has length p/p3
(inverse square law). Gravity from a point mass pulls inward (minus sign). The electric
field from a point charge repels outward. The three steps almost show that div F = 0:
Step 1. ap/ax = x/p, dplay = y/p, apldz = z/p-but

Step 3. div F = 3lp3 - 3(x2+ y2 + z2)/p5= 3lp3 - 3lp3 = 0.
The calculation div F = 0 leaves a puzzle. One side of the Divergence Theorem seems
to give jjjO dV= 0. Then the other side should be jJ F * ndS = 0. But the flux is not
zero when all flow is outward:
The unit normal vector to the sphere p = constant is n = Rip.
The outward flow F n = ( ~ 1 (Rip)
~ ~=)p2/p4 is always positive.
Then jj F ndS = jj ds/p2 = 4np2/p2= 4n. We have reached 4n = 0.

584

15 Vector Calculus
This paradox in three dimensions is the same as for R/r2 in two dimensions.
Section 15.3 reached 27r = 0, and the explanation was a point source at the origin.
Same explanation here: M, N, P are infinite when p = 0. The divergence is a "delta
function" times 47r, from the point source. The Divergence Theorem does not apply
(unless we allow delta functions). That single point makes all the difference.
Every surface enclosing the origin has flux = 47r. Our calculation was for a sphere.
The surface integral is much harder when S is twisted (Figure 15.21 a). But the Divergence Theorem takes care of everything, because div F = 0 in the volume V between
these surfaces. Therefore Jf F ndS = 0 for the two surfaces together. The flux
If F . ndS = - 4n into the sphere must be balanced by If F ndS = 4n7r out of the twisted
surface.

Instead of a paradox 47r = 0, this example leads to Gauss's Law. A mass M at the

electric field E = (q/4rneo)R/p
constant is the relation between divergence and flux. Equation (1)yields equation (2),

concentrated at the origin:

(2)

THE REASONING BEHIND THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM
The general principle is clear: Flow out minus flow in equals source. Our goal is to
see why the divergence of F measures the source. In a small box around each point,
we show that div F dV balances F *ndS through the six sides.
So consider a small box. Its center is at (x, y, z). Its edges have length Ax, Ay, Az.
Out of the top and bottom, the normal vectors are k and -k. The dot product with
F = Mi + Nj + Pk is + P or -P. The area AS is AxAy. So the two fluxes are close
to P(x, y, z + ½Az)AxAy and - P(x, y, z - ½Az)AxAy. When the top is combined with
the bottom, the difference of those P's is AP:
net flux upward ,- APAxAy = (AP/Az)AxAyAz , (OP/Oz)A V.

15.5 The Divergence Theorem

Similarly, the combined flux on two side faces is approximately (aN/ay)AK On the
front and back it is (dM/ax)AK Adding the six faces, we reach the key point:
flux out of the box x (aM/dx

+ aN/dy + dP/az)AK

(4)
This is (div F)AK For a constant field both sides are zero-the flow goes straight
through. For F = xi yj + zk, a little more goes out than comes in. The divergence
is 3, so 3AV is created inside the box. By the balance equation the flux is also 3AK
The approximation symbol x means that the leading term is correct (probably
not the next term). The ratio APlAz is not exactly dP/az. The difference is of order
Az, so the error in (3) is of higher order AVAz. Added over many boxes (about 1/AV
boxes), this error disappears as Az + 0.
The sum of (div F)A V over all the boxes approaches [Sj(div F)dK On the other
side of the equation is a sum of fluxes. There is F *nAS out of the top of one box,
plus F nAS out of the bottom of the box above. The first has n = k and the second
has n = - k. They cancel each other-the flow goes from box to box. This happens
every time two boxes meet. The only fluxes that survive (because nothing cancels
them) are at the outer surface S. The final step, as Ax, Ay, Az + 0,is that those outside
terms approach F ndS. Then the local divergence theorem (4) becomes the global
Divergence Theorem (1).

+

11

Remark on the proof That "final step" is not easy, because the box surfaces don't
line up with the outer surface S. A formal proof of the Divergence Theorem would
imitate the proof of Green's Theorem. On a very simple region JjJ(aP/az)dx dy dz
equals P dx dy over the top minus P dx dy over the bottom. After checking the
orientation this is Pk ndS. Similarly the volume integrals of dM/ax and dN/dy are
the surface integrals Mi ndS and 11Nj ndS. Adding the three integrals gives the
Divergence Theorem. Since Green's Theorem was already proved in this way, the
reasoning behind (4) is more helpful than repeating a detailed proof.
The discoverer of the Divergence Theorem was probably Gauss. His notebooks
only contain the outline of a proof-but after all, this is Gauss. Green and Ostrogradsky both published proofs in 1828, one in England and the other in St. Petersburg
(now Leningrad). As the theorem was studied, the requirements came to light (smoothness of F and S, avoidance of one-sided Mobius strips).
New applications are discovered all the time-when a scientist writes down a balance equation in a small box. The source is known. The equation is div F = source.
After Example 5 we explain F.

This example illustrates the basic framework of equilibrium. The pattern appears
everywhere in applied mathematics-electromagnetism, heat flow, elasticity, even
relativity. There is usually a constant c that depends on the material (the example
has c = 1). The names change, but we always take the divergence of the gradient:

Then div(- c grad T)= heat source
Then div(- c grad u) = outside force.

You are studying calculus, not physics or thermodynamics or elasticity. But please
notice the main point. The equation to solve is div(- c grad f ) = known source. The
divergence and gradient are exactly what the applications need. Calculus teaches the
right things.
This framework is developed in many books, including my own text Introduction
to Applied Mathematics (Wellesley-Cambridge Press). It governs equilibrium, in matrix equations and differential equations.
PRODUCT RULE FOR VECTORS: INTEGRATION BY PARTS

May I go back to basic facts about the divergence? First the definition:
F(X, y, Z)= Mi

+ Nj + ~k has div F = v

F =a ~ l a +
x a ~ l a+
y aplaz.

The divergence is a scalar (not a vector). At each point div F is a number. In fluid
flow, it is the rate at which mass leaves-the "flux per unit volume" or "flux density."
The symbol V stands for a vector whose components are operations not numbers:

v = "del" = i alax + j alay + k alaz.

(6)

This vector is illegal but very useful. First, apply it to an ordinary function f(x, y, z):

Vf ="del f"

= i aflax+j af/dy+ k df/az=gradient off.

Second, take the dot product V F with a vector function F(x, y, z) = Mi

(7)

+ Nj + Pk:

V F = "del dot F" = aM/dx + aN/dy + aP/az = divergence of F.

(8)

Third, take the cross product V x F. This produces the vector curl F (next section):

V x F = "del cross F" = ... (to be defined). .. = curl of F .

(9)

The gradient and divergence and curl are V and V and V x . The three great operations of vector calculus use a single notation! You are free to write V or not-to
make equations shorter or to help the memory. Notice that Laplace's equation
shrinks to

Equation (10) gives the potential when the source is zero (very common). F = grad f
combines with div F = 0 into Laplace's equation div grad f = 0. This equation is so
important that it shrinks further to V2f = 0 and even to Af = 0. Of course Af =
fxx
fyy+ f,, has nothing to do with Af=f (x + Ax) -f (x). Above all, remember that
f is a scalar and F is a vector: gradient of scalar is vector and divergence of vector is
scalar.

15.5 The Divergence Theorem

Underlying this chapter is the idea of extending calculus to vectors. So far we have
emphasized the Fundamental Theorem. The integral of df/dx is now the integral of
div F. Instead of endpoints a and b, we have a curve C or surface S. But it is the rules
for derivatives and integrals that make calculus work, and we need them now for
vectors. Remember the derivative of u times v and the integral (by parts) of u dvldx:
15M Scalar functions u(x, y, z) and vector fields V (x, y, z) obey the product rule:

div(uV) = u div V + V (grad zr).

(11)

The reverse of the product rule is integration by parts (Gauss's Formula):

For a plane field this is Green's Fwmurla (and u = 1 gives Green's Theorem):

Those look like heavy formulas. They are too much to memorize, unless you use
them often. The important point is to connect vector calculus with "scalar calculus,"
which is not heavy. Every product rule yields two terms:

Add those ordinary rules and you have the vector rule (1 1) for the divergence of uV.
Integrating the two parts of div(uV) gives uV ndS by the Divergence Theorem.
Then one part moves to the other side, producing the minus signs in (12) and (13).
Integration by parts leaves a boundary term, in three and two dimensions as it did in
one dimension: uvtdx = - j utvdx + [uv]:.

I[

EXAMPLE 5 Find the divergence of F = R/p2, starting from grad p = R/p.

Solution Take V = R and u = llp2 in the product rule (1 1). Then div F = (div R)/
P2 + R (grad l/p2). The divergence of R = xi + yj + zk is 3. For grad l/p2 apply the
chain rule:

R (grad llp2)= - 2R (grad p)/p3 = - 2R R/p4 = - 2/p2.
The two parts of div F combine into 3/p2 - 2/p2 = l/p2-as

claimed in Example 4.

EXAMPLE 6 Find the balance equation for flow with velocity V and fluid density p.

V is the rate of movement of fluid, while pV is the rate of movement of mass.
Comparing the ocean to the atmosphere shows the difference. Air has a greater
velocity than water, but a much lower density. So normally F = pV is larger for the
ocean. (Don't confuse the density p with the radial distance p. The Greeks only used
24 letters.)
There is another difference between water and air. Water is virtually incompressible
(meaning p = constant). Air is certainly compressible (its density varies). The balance
equation is a fundamental law-the conservation of mass or the "continuity equation"
for fluids. This is a mathematical statement about a physical flow without sources or
sinks:
Continuity Equation: div(pV) + 3plat = 0.
(14)

15 Vector Calculus

Explanation: The mass in a region is j j j p d V . Its rate of decrease is - j j j a p l a t dV.
The decrease comes from flow out through the surface (normal vector n). The dot
product F n = p V * n is the rate of mass flow through the surface. So the integral
S j F n d S is the total rate that mass goes out. By the Divergence Theorem this is
j j j div F d V.
To balance - j j j d p / d t d V in every region, div F must equal - a p l d t at every point.
The figure shows this continuity equation (14) for flow in the x direction.

For the Divergence Theorem, the surface was closed. S was the boundary of V.
Now the surface is not closed and S has its own boundary-a curve called C. We
are back near the original setting for Green's Theorem (region bounded by curve,
double integral equal to work integral). But Stokes' Theorem, also called Stokes's
Theorem, is in three-dimensional space. There is a curved surface S bounded by a
space curve C. This is our first integral around a space curve.
The move to three dimensions brings a change in the vector field. The plane field
F(x, y) = Mi + Nj becomes a space field F(x, y, z) = Mi + Nj + Pk. The work
Mdx + Ndy now includes Pdz. The critical quantity in the double integral (it was
aN/ax - aM/dy) must change too. We called this scalar quantity "curl F," but in
reality it is only the third component of a vector. Stokes' Theorem needs all three
components of that vector-which is curl F.

The three products i d/dy P and j dldz M and k dldx N have plus signs. The three

This determinant helps the memory, even if it looks and is illegal. A determinant is
not supposed to have a row of vectors, a row of operators, and a row of functions.
EXAMPLE 1 The plane field M(x, y)i + N(x, y)j has P = 0 and dM/az = 0 and
dN/dz = 0. Only two terms survive: curl F = (aNldx - dM/ay)k. Back to Green.

The divergence of a spin field is M , + N , + P, = 0 + 0 + 0. Note how the divergence
uses M, while the curl uses N , and P,. The curl of S is the vector 2a:

This example begins to reveal the meaning of the curl. It measures the spin! The direction of curl F is the axis of rotation-in this case along a. The magnitude of curl F is
twice the speed of rotation. In this case lcurl FI = 2/al and the angular velocity is la].

Again the mixed derivatives give Pxy= Pyxand Nxz = Nzx and Mzy = Myz. The terms

I

The spin field S has no divergence. The position field R has no curl. R is the gradient
of f = &x2 + y2 + z2). S is the curl of a suitable F. Then div S = div curl F and
curl R = curl grad f are automatically zero.
You correctly believe that curl F measures the "spin" of the field. You may expect
that curl (F + G) is curl F + curl G. Also correct. Finally you may think that a field
of parallel vectors has no spin. That is wrong. Example 5 has parallel vectors, but
their different lengths produce spin.
EXAMPLE 5 The field V = zi in the x direction has curl V =j in the y direction.

If you put a wheel in the xz plane, thisfield will turn it. The velocity zi at the top of
the wheel is greater than zi at the bottom (Figure 15.23~).So the top goes faster and
the wheel rotates. The axis of rotation is curl V =j. The turning speed is ), because
this curl has magnitude 1.
Another velocity field v = - xk produces the same spin: curl v =j. The flow is in
the z direction, it varies in the x direction, and the spin is in the y direction. Also
interesting is V + v. The two "shear fields" add to a perfect spin field S = zi - xk,
whose curl is 2j.
THE MEANING OF CURL F

Example 5 put a paddlewheel into the flow. This is possible for any vector field F,
and it gives insight into curl F. The turning of the wheel (if it turns) depends on its
location (x, y, z). The turning also depends on the orientation of the wheel. We could
put it into a spin field, and if the wheel axis n is perpendicular to the spin axis a, the
wheel won't turn! The general rule for turning speed is this: the angular velocity of
the wheel is %curl F) n. This is the bbdirectionalspin," just as (gradf ) o was the
"directional derivative"-and n is a unit vector like u.
There is no spin anywhere in a gradient field. It is irrotational: curl grad f = 0.
The pure spin field a x R has curl F = 2a. The angular velocity is a n (note that
) cancels 2). This turning is everywhere, not just at the origin. If you put a penny on
a compact disk, it turns once when the disk rotates once. That spin is "around itself,"
and it is the same whether the penny is at the center or not.
The turning speed is greatest when the wheel axis n lines up with the spin axis a.
Then a n is the full length (a(.The gradient gives the direction of fastest growth, and
the curl gives the direction of fastest turning:
maximum growth rate off is lgradf 1 in the direction of grad f
maximum rotation rate of F is f lcurl FI in the direction of curl F.

15 Vector Calculus
STOKES' THEOREM
Finally we come to the big theorem. It will be like Green's Theorem-a line integral
equals a surface integral. The line integral is still the work fF* dR around a curve.
The surface integral in Green's Theorem is ff (Nx - M,) dx dy. The surface is flat (in
the xy plane). Its normal direction is k, and we now recognize Nx - My as the k
component of the curl. Green's Theorem uses only this component because the normal direction is always k. For Stokes' Theorem on a curved surface, we need all three
components of curl F.
Figure 15.24 shows a hat-shaped surface S and its boundary C (a closed curve).
Walking in the positive direction around C, with your head pointing in the direction
of n, the surface is on your left. You may be standing straight up (n = k in Green's
Theorem). You may even be upside down (n = - k is allowed). In that case you must
go the other way around C, to keep the two sides of equation (6)equal. The surface is
still on the left. A M6bius strip is not allowed, because its normal direction cannot be
established. The unit vector n determines the "counterclockwise direction" along C.

(6)

The right side adds up small spins in the surface. The left side is the total circulation
(or work) around C. That is not easy to visualize-this may be the hardest theorem
in the book-but notice one simple conclusion. If curl F = 0 then f F . dR = 0. This
applies above all to gradientfields-as we know.
A gradient field has no curl, by (4). A gradient field does no work, by (6). In three
dimensions as in two dimensions, gradientfields are conservativefields. They will be
the focus of this section, after we outline a proof (or two proofs) of Stokes' Theorem.
The first proof shows why the theorem is true. The second proof shows that it
really is true (and how to compute). You may prefer the first.
Firstproof Figure 15.24 has a triangle ABC attached to a triangle ACD. Later there
can be more triangles. S will be piecewiseflat, close to a curved surface. Two triangles
are enough to make the point. In the plane of each triangle (they have different n's)
Green's Theorem is known:

Now add. The right sides give ff curl F . ndS over the two triangles. On the left, the
integral over CA cancels the integral over AC. The "crosscut" disappears. That leaves
AB + BC + CD + DA. This line integral goes around the outer boundary C-which
is the left side of Stokes' Theorem.

Second proof Now the surface can be curved. A new proof may seem excessive, but
it brings formulas you could compute with. From z =f(x, y) we have

To prove (7) = (8), change M in Green's Theorem to M + Paflax. Also change N to
N Paflay. Then (7) = (8) is Green's Theorem down on the shadow (Problem 47).
This proves Stokes' Theorem up on S. Notice how Green's Theorem (flat surface)
was the key to both proofs of Stokes' Theorem (curved surface).

EXAMPLE 6 Stokes' Theorem in electricity and magnetism yields Faraday's Law.

Stokes' Theorem is not heavily used for calculations-equation (8) shows why. But
the spin or curl or vorticity of a flow is absolutely basic in fluid mechanics. The other
important application, coming now, is to electric fields. Faraday's Law is to Gauss's
Law as Stokes' Theorem is to the Divergence Theorem.
Suppose the curve C is an actual wire. We can produce current along C by varying
the magnetic field B(t). The flux q = JJ B ndS, passing within C and changing in time,
creates an electric field E that does work:
/.

Faraday's Law (integral form): work =

I

E dR = - dqldt.

That is physics. It may be true, it may be an approximation. Now comes mathematics
(surely true), which turns this integral form into a differential equation. Information
at points is more convenient than information around curves. Stokes converts the
line integral of E into the surface integral of curl E:

$ E mdR = 11curl E

These are equal for any curve C, however small. So the right sides are equal for any
surface S. We squeeze to a point. The right hand sides give one of Maxwell's equations:
Faraday's Law (differential form): curl E = - aBldt.
CONSERVATIVE FIELDS AND POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS

The chapter ends with our constant and important question: Which fields do no
work around closed curves? Remember test D for plane curves and plane vector
fields:

-

if aM/dy = dN/dx then F is conservative and F = grad f and $ F dR = 0.
Now allow a three-dimensional field like F = 2xy i + (x2 + z)j + yk. Does it do work
around a space curve? Or is it a gradient field? That will require aflax = 2xy and
afjdy = x2 + z and af/az = y. We have three equations for one function f(x, y, z).
Normally they can't be solved. When test D is passed (now it is the three-dimensional
test: curl F = 0) they can be solved. This example passes test D, and f is x2y + yz.

15 V e r Calculus

+ +

I S P F(x, y, z)= Mi Nj Pk is a conservative field if it has these properties:
A. The work F da around every closed path in space is zero.
B. The work $F dR depends only on P and Q, not on the path in space.
C. F is a graden? fild M = af /ax and N = af/dy and P = df/az.
D. The components satisfy M y= N,, M, = P,, and N, = P, (curl F is zero).
A field with one of these properties has them all. D is the quick test.

f

A detailed proof of A * B =.> C * D * A is not needed. Only notice how C a D:
curl grad F is always zero. The newest part is D * A. Ifcurl F = 0 then f F dR = 0.
But that is not news. It is Stokes' Theorem.
The interesting problem is to solve the three equations forf, when test D is passed.
The example above had
df/dx = 2xy

f = 5 2xy dx = x2y plus any function C(y, z)

+

dfldy = x2 z = x2 + dC/dy

C = yz plus any function C(Z)

+

df/dz = y = y dcldz c(z) can be zero.
The first step leaves an arbitrary C(y, z) to fix the second step. The second step leaves
an arbitrary c(z) to fix the third step (not needed here). Assembling the three steps,
f = x2y + C = x2y yz c = x~~ + yz. Please recognize that the "fix-up" is only possible when curl F = 0. Test D must be passed.

+ +

EXAMPLE 7 Is F = (Z- y)i + (x - z)j

+ (y - x)k the gradient of any f ?

Test D says no. This F is a spin field a x R. Its curl is 2a = (2,2,2), which is not zero.
A search for f is bound to fail, but we can try. To match df/dx = z - y, we must have
f = zx - yx + C(y, z). The y derivative is -x + dC/dy. That never matches N = x - z,
so f can't exist.

+

+

EXAMPLE 8 What choice of P makes F = yz2i xz2j Pk conservative? Findf:

Solution We need curl F = 0, by test D. First check dM/dy = z2 = dNjdx. Also

and
dP/dy = dN/az = ~ X Z .
dP/dx = aM/dz = 2yz
P = 2xyz passes all tests. To find f we can solve the three equations, or notice that

is F.
A third method definesf (x, y, z) as the work to reach (x, y, z)from (0,0,O). The path
doesn't matter. For practice we integrate F dR = M dx + N dy + P dz along the
straight line (xt, yt, zt):
f ( ~ y,, Z) =

EXAMPLE 9 Why is div curl grad f automatically zero (in two ways)?

Solution First, curl grad f is zero (always). Second, div curl F is zero (always).Those
are the key identities of vector calculus. We end with a review.

15.6 Stokes' Theorem and the Curl of F

Divergence Theorem:
Stokes' Theorem:

j? curl F * n d S .

The first form of Green's Theorem leads to Stokes' Theorem. The second form
becomes the Divergence Theorem. You may ask, why not go to three dimensions in
the f i s t place? The last two theorems contain the first two (take P = 0 and a flat
surface). We could have reduced this chapter to two theorems, not four. I admit that,
but a fundamental principle is involved: "It is easier to generalize than to specialize."
For the same reason d f l d x came before partial derivatives and the gradient.

Mathematics after Calculus

I would like this book to do more than help you pass calculus. (I hope it does that
too.) After calculus you will have choices- Which mathematics course to take next?and these pages aim to serve as a guide. Part of the answer depends on where you
are going-toward engineering or management or teaching or science or another
career where mathematics plays a part. The rest of the answer depends on where the
courses are going. This chapter can be a useful reference, to give a clearer idea than
course titles can do:
Linear Algebra

Differential Equations

Advanced Calculus (with Fourier Series)

Discrete Mathematics

Numerical Methods

Statistics

Pure mathematics is often divided into analysis and algebra and geometry. Those
parts come together in the "mathematical way of thinking9'-a mixture of logic
and ideas. It is a deep and creative subject-here we make a start.
Two main courses after calculus are linear algebra and differential equations.
I hope you can take both. To help you later, Sections 16.1 and 16.2 organize them
by examples. First a few words to compare and contrast those two subjects.
Linear algebra is about systems of equations. There are n variables to solve for. A
change in one affects the others. They can be prices or velocities or currents or
concentrations-outputs from any model with interconnected parts.
Linear algebra makes only one assumption-the model must be linear. A change
in one variable produces proportional changes in all variables. Practically every
subject begins that way. (When it becomes nonlinear, we solve by a sequence of linear
equations. Linear programming is nonlinear because we require x >, 0.)Elsewhere J
wrote that "Linear algebra has become as basic and as applicable as calculus, and
fortunately it is easier." I recommend taking it.
A differential equation is continuous (from calculus), where a matrix equation is
discrete (from algebra). The rate dyldt is determined by the present state y-which
changes by following that rule. Section 16.2 solves y' = cy + s(t) for economics and
life sciences, and y" + by' + cy =f(t) for physics and engineering. Please keep it and
refer to it.

16 Mathematics after Calculus

A third key direction is discrete mathematics. Matrices are a part, networks and
algorithms are a bigger part. Derivatives are not a part-this is closer to algebra. It
is needed in computer science. Some people have a knack for counting the ways a
computer can send ten messages in parallel-and for finding the fastest way.
Typical question: Can 25 states be matched with 25 neighbors, so one state in each
pair has an even number of letters? New York can pair with New Jersey, Texas with
Oklahoma, California with Arizona. We need rules for Hawaii and Alaska. This
matching question doesn't sound mathematical, but it is.
Section 16.3 selects four topics from discrete mathematics, so you can decide if you
want more.
Go back for a moment to calculus and differential equations. A completely realistic
problem is seldom easy, but we can solve models. (Developing a good model is a skill
in itself.) One method of solution involves complex numbers:
any function u(x

+ iy)

any function eik("+")

solves

+

uxx u,,

solves u,,

-

=0

(Laplace equation)

c2uxx= 0 (wave equation).

From those building blocks we assemble solutions. For the wave equation, a signal
starts at t = 0.It is a combination of pure oscillations eikx.The coefficients in that
combination make up the Fourier transform-to tell how much of each frequency is
in the signal. A lot of engineers and scientists would rather know those Fourier
coefficients than f(x).
A Fourier series breaks the signal into Z a, cos kx or Z b, sin kx or T. ekeikx.
These sums can be infinite (like power series). Instead of values of f(x), or derivatives
at the basepoint, the function is described by a,, b,, c,. Everything is computed by
the "Fast Fourier Transform." This is the greatest algorithm since Newton's method.
A radio signal is near one frequency. A step function has many frequencies. A delta
function has every frequency in the same amount: 6(x) = Z cos kx. Channel 4 can't
broadcast a perfect step function. You wouldn't want to hear a delta function.
We mentioned computing. For nonlinear equations this means Newton's method.
For Ax = b it means elimination-algorithms take the place of formulas. Exact solutions are gone-speed and accuracy and stability become essential. It seems right to
make scientific computing a part of applied mathematics, and teach the algorithms
with the theory. My text Introduction to Applied Mathematics is one step in this
direction, trying to present advanced calculus as it is actually used.
We cannot discuss applications and forget statistics. Our society produces oceans
of data-somebody has to draw conclusions. To decide if a new drug works, and if
oil spills are common or rare, and how often to have a checkup, we can't just guess.
I am astounded that the connection between smoking and health was hidden for
centuries. It was in the data! Eventually the statisticians uncovered it. Professionals
can find patterns, and the rest of us can understand (with a little mathematics) what
has been found.
One purpose in studying mathematics is to know more about your own life.
Calculus lights up a key idea: Functions. Shapes and populations and heart signals
and profits and growth rates, all are given by functions. They change in time. They
have integrals and derivatives. To understand and use them is a challengemathematics takes effort. A lot of people have contributed, in whatever way they
could-as you and I are doing. We may not be Newton or Leibniz or Gauss or
Einstein, but we can share some part of what they created.

16.1 Vector Spaces and Llnear Algebra

16.1 Vector Spaces and Linear Algebra
You have met the idea of a matrix. An m by n matrix A has m rows and n columns
(it is square if m = n). It multiplies a vector x that has n components. The result is a
vector Ax with m components. The central problem of linear algebra is to go backward: From Ax = bfind x. That is possible when A is square and invertible. Otherwise
there is no solution x-or there are infinitely many.
The crucial property of matrix multiplication is linearity. If Ax = b and AX = B
then A times x X is b B. Also A times 2x is 2b. In general A times cx is cb.
In particular A times 0 is 0 (one vector has n zeros, the other vector has m zeros). The
whole subject develops from linearity. Derivatives and integrals obey linearity too.

Question 1 What are the solutions to Ax = O? One solution is x = 0. There
may be other solutions and they fill up the "nullspace":

When there are more unknowns than equations-when A has more columns than
rows-the system Ax = 0 has many solutions. They are not scattered randomly
around! Another solution is X = 4, Y= - 2, Z = 6. This lies on the same line as
(2, - 1,3) and (0,0,O). Always the solutions to Ax = 0 form a "space" of vectorswhich brings us to a central idea of linear algebra.

Note These pages are not concentrating on the mechanics of multiplying or inverting matrices. Those are explained in all courses. My own teaching emphasizes that
Ax is a combination of the columns of A. The solution x = A-'b is computed by
elimination. Here we explain the deeper idea of a vector space-and especially the
particular spaces that control Ax = 6. I cannot go into the same detail as in my book
on Linear Algebra and Its Applications, where examples and exercises develop the
new ideas. Still these pages can be a useful support.
All vectors with n components lie in n-dimensional space. You can add them and
subtract them and multiply them by any c. (Don't multiply two vectors and never
write llx or 1/A). The results x + X and x - X and cx are still vectors in the space.
Here is the important point:
The line of solutions to Ax = 0 is a "subspace"-a vector space in its own right.
The sum x X has components 6, - 3,9-which is another solution. The difference
x - X is a solution, and so is 4x. These operations leave us in the subspace.

+

The nullspace consists of all solutions to Ax = 0. It may contain only the zero
vector (as in the first example). It may contain a line of vectors (as in the second
example). It may contain a whole plane of vectors (Problem 5). In every case x + X
and x - X and cx are also in the nullspace. We are assigning a new word to an old
idea-the equation x - 2y = 0 has always been represented by a line (its nullspace).
Now we have 6-dimensional subspaces of an %dimensional vector space.
Notice that x2 - y = 0 does not produce a subspace (a parabola instead). Even the
x and y axes together, from xy = 0, do not form a subspace. We go off the axes when
we add (1,O) to (0, 1). You might expect the straight line x - 2y = 1 to be a subspace,
but again it is not so. When x and y are doubled, we have X - 2Y = 2. Then (X, Y)
is on a different line. Only Ax = 0 is guaranteed to produce a subspace.

16 Mathematics after Calculus

Figure 16.1 shows the nullspace and "row space." Check dot products (both zero).

Fig. 16.1

The nullspace is perpendicular to the rows of A (the columns of AT).

Question 2 When A multiplies a vector x, what subspace does Ax lie in? The
product Ax is a combination of the columns of A-hence the name "column space":

No choice of x can produce Ax = (0,0, 1). For this A, all combinations of the columns
. The column space is like the xy plane within xyz space. It is a
end in a
subspace of m-dimensional space, containing every vector b that is a combination of
the columns:
The system Ax = b has a solution exactly when b is in the column space.

When A has an inverse, the column space is the whole n-dimensional space. The
nullspace contains only x = 0. There is exactly one solution x = A 1 b . This is the
good case-and we outline four more key topics in linear algebra.

1. Basis and dimension of a subspace. A one-dimensional subspace is a line. A plane
has dimension two. The nullspace above contained all multiples of (2, - 1, 3)-by
knowing that "basis vector" we know the whole line. The column space was a plane
containing column 1 and column 2. Again those vectors are a "basis"-by knowing
the columns we know the whole column space.
Our 2 by 3 matrix has three columns: (1,O) and (2, 3) and (0, 1). Those are not a
basis for the column space! This space is only a plane, and three vectors are too
many. The dimension is two. By combining (1,O) and (0, 1) we can produce the other
vector (2, 3). There are only two independent columns, and they form a basis for this
column space.
In general: When a subspace contains r independent vectors, and no more, those
vectors are a basis and the dimension is r. "Independent" means that no vector is a
combination of the others. In the example, (1,O) and (2, 3) are also a basis. A subspace
has many bases, just as a plane has many axes.
2. Least squares. If Ax = b has no solution, we look for the x that comes closest.
Section 1 1.4 found the straight line nearest to a set of points. We make the length
of Ax - b as small as possible, when zero length is not possible. No vector solves

16.1 Vector Spaces and Llnear Algebra

Ax = b, when b is not in the column space. So b is projected onto that space. This
leads to the "normal equations" that produce the best x:

When a rectangular matrix appears in applications, its transpose generally comes
too. The columns of A are the rows of AT. The rows of A are the columns of AT.
Then AT^ is square and symmetric-equal to its transpose and vital for applied
mathematics.

3. Eigenvalues (for square matrices only). Normally Ax points in a direction
different from x. For certain special eigenvectors, Ax is parallel to x. Here is a 2 by
2 matrix with two eigenvectors-in one case Ax = 5x and in the other Ax = 2x;
3 2

Ax=Ax:

[

1

1 4][]=[:]=5[:]
1

and

[:

:][-:]=[-:]=2[-:].

The multipliers 5 and 2 are the eigenvalues of A. An 8 by 8 matrix has eight eigenvalues, which tell what the matrix is doing (to the eigenvectors). The eigenvectors are
uncoupled, and they go their own way. A system of equations dyldt = Ay acts like
one equation-when y is an eigenvector:
d ~ i l d t =3 ~ 1 +
2~2
dyddt = yi + 4 ~ 2

has the solution

yl

= eSt

y2 = eSt

which is est

[:I.

The eigenvector is (1, 1).The eigenvalue A = 5 is in the exponent. When you substitute
y1 and y2 the differential equations become 5est = 5est. The fundamental principle
for dyldt = cy still works for the system dyldt = Ay: Look for pure exponential solutions. The eigenvalue "lambda" is the growth rate in the exponent.
I have to add: Find the eigenvectors also. The second eigenvector (2, - 1) has
eigenvalue i= 2. A second solution is y1 = 2e2', y2 = - e". Substitute those into the
equation-they are even better at displaying the general rule:

If

Ax = Ax then d/dt(ehx) = ~ ( e ~ ~ xThe
) . pure exponentials are y = eAtx.

The four entries of A pull together for the eigenvector. So do the 64 entries of an
8 by 8 matrix-again e"x solves the equation. Growth or decay is decided by A > 0
or K < 0. When A = k + iw is a complex number, growth and oscillation combine in
e ~=
t e k t e i ~ t = ekt(coswt + i sin at).
Subspaces govern static problems Ax = b. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
govern dynamic problems dyldt = Ay. Look for exponentials y = eUx.
4. Determinants and inverse matrices. A 2 by 2 matrix has determinant D = ad - bc.
This matrix has no inverse if D = 0.Reason: A-' divides by D:

This pattern extends to n by n matrices, but D and A - l become more 'complicated.
For 3 by 3 matrices D has six terms. Section 11.5 identified D as a triple product
a (b x c) of the columns. Three events come together in the singular case: D is zero
and A has no inverse and the columns lie in a plane. The opposite events produce the
"nonsingular" case: D is nonzero and A- ' exists. Then Ax = b is solved by x = A- b.

16 Mathematics after Calculus

D is also the product of the pivots and the product of the eigenvalues. The pivots
arise in elimination-the practical way to solve Ax = b without A - ' . To find eigenvalues we turn Ax = Ax into ( A - i1)x = 0 . By a nice twist of fate, this matrix A - A1
has D = 0.Go back to the example:

[f

:]-A[:

:]=[j;' 4iA]

has D = ( i - q ( 4 - A ) - 2 = A 2 - 7 A l O .

The equation A2 - 71. + 10 = 0 gives 1. = 5 and A = 2. The eigenvalues come first, to
make D = 0.Then ( A - 51)x = 0 and (A - 2I)x = 0 yield the eigenvectors. These x's
go into y = e"x to solve differential equations-which come next.

If Ax = b and A X = B, then A times 2x + 3X equals a .
If Ax = 0 and A X = 0 then A times 2x + 3 X equals b .
In this case x and X are in the c of A, and so is the

Another subspace is the h space of A, containing all

16.2 Differential Equations
We just solved differential equations by linear algebra. Those were special systems
dyJdt = Ay, linear with constant coefficients. The solutions were exponentials,
involving eU. The eigenvalues of A were the "growth factors" A. This section solves
other equations-by no means all. We concentrate on a few that have important
applications.
Return for a moment to the beginning-when direct integration was king:
In 1, y(t) is the integral of s(t). In 2, y(t) is the integral of cy(t). That sounds circularit only made sense after the discovery of y = ec'. This exponential has the correct
derivative cy. To find it by integration instead of inventing it, separate y from t:
Separation and integration also solve 3: j dy/u(y)= 5 c(t)dt. The model logistic equation
has u = y - y2 = quadratic. Equation 2 has u = y = linear. Equation 1is also a special
case with u = 1 = constant. But 2 and 1 are very different, for the following reason.
The compound interest equation y' = cy is growing from inside. The equation
y' = s(t) is growing from outside. Where c is a "growth rate," s is a "source." They
don't have the same meaning, and they don't have the same units. The combination
y' = cy + s was solved in Chapter 6, provided c and s are constant-but applications
force us to go further.

16 Mathematics after Calculus

In three examples we introduce non-constant source terms.
EXAMPLE 1 Solve dyldt = cy

+ s with the new source term s = ekt.

Method Substitute y = B@, with an "undetermined coefficient" B to make it right:

kBek' = cBek' + ekt yields B = l/(k - c).
The source ek' is the driving term. The solution Bekt is the response. The exponent is
the same! The key idea is to expect ek' in the response.
Initial condition To match yo at t = 0, the solution needs another exponential.
It is the free response Aec', which satisfies dyldt = cy with no source. To make
y = Aec' + Bek' agree with yo, choose A = yo - B:
Final solution y = (yo - B)ec' + Bekt = yoect+ (ek' - ec')/(k- c).

(1)

Exceptional case B = l / ( k - c) grows larger as k approaches c. When k = c the
method breaks down-the response Bek' is no longer correct. The solution (1)
approaches 010, and in the limit we get a derivative. It has an extra factor t:
ekt - ect
d
- change in ect + -(ect)= tect.
k -c
change in c
dc

The correct response is tectwhen k = c. This is the form to substitute, when the driving
rate k equals the natural rate c (called resonance).
Add the free response yoec' to match the initial condition.
EXAMPLE 2 Solve dyldt = cy + s with the new source term s = cos kt.

Substitute y = B sin kt + D cos kt. This has two undetermined coefficients B and D:

kB cos kt - kD sin kt = c(B sin kt + D cos kt) + cos kt.

(3)
Matching cosines gives kB = cD + 1. The sines give - kD = cB. Algebra gives B, D, y:
B=-

C

k2 + c2

D=-

y=

(4)

Question Why do we need both B sin kt and D cos kt in the response to cos kt?

First Answer Equation (3) is impossible if we leave out B or D.
Second Answer cos kt is f eikt+ i e -"'. So eiktand e - "' are both in the response.

EXAMPLE 3 Solve dyldt = cy + s with the new source term s = tekt.

SECOND-ORDER EQUATIONS

The equation dyldt = cy is jrst-order. The equation d2y/dt2= - cy is second-order.
The first is typical of problems in life sciences and economics-the rate dyldt depends
on the present situation y. The second is typical of engineering and physical sciencesthe acceleration d2y/dt2enters the equation.

16.2 Differential Equations

A mathematician compares a straight line to a parabola. The straight line crosses
the x axis no more than once. The parabola can cross twice. The equation
ax2 + bx c = 0 has two solutions, provided we allow them to be complex or equal.
These are exactly the possibilities we face below: two real solutions, two complex
solutions, or one solution that counts twice. The quadratic could be x2 - 1 or x2 + 1
or x2. The roots are 1 and - 1, i and - i, 0 and 0.
In solving diflerential equations the roots appear in the exponent, and are called A.

and y = e-'
A = 1, - 1
EXAMPLE 4 y" = + y: solutions y = et
EXAMPLE 5 y" = 0 y: solutions y = 1
iZ = 0 , 0
and y = t
EXAMPLE 6 y" = -y: solutions y = cos t and y = sin t A = i, -i
Where are the complex solutions? They are hidden in Example 6, which could be
written y = eitand y = e-". These satisfy y" = - y since i2 = - 1. The use of sines and
cosines avoids the imaginary number i, but it breaks the pattern of e".
Example 5 also seems to break the pattern-again eUis hidden. The solution y = 1
is eO'. The other solution y = t is teot. The zero exponent is repeated-another exceptional case that needs an extra factor t.
Exponentials solve every equation with constant coeficients and zero right hand side:
To solve ay" + by' + cy = 0 substitute y = e"

and find A.

This method has three steps, leading to the right exponents A = r and A = s:
1. With y = eU the equation is aA2ee"+ bAe" + ceAt= 0. Cancel e".
2. Solve aA2 + bA + c = 0. Factor or use the formula A = (- b f Jbi-rlac)/2a.
3. Call those roots A = r and A= s. The complete solution is y = Aert + Best.

The pure exponentials are y = er' and y = e". Depending on r and s, they grow or
decay or oscillate. They are combined with constants A and B to match the two
conditions at t = 0. The initial state yo equals A B. The initial velocity yb equals
rA + sB (the derivative at t = 0).

+

EXAMPLE 7 Solve y" - 3y'

+ 2y = 0 with yo = 5 and yb = 4.

Step 1 substitutes y = e". The equation becomes i2e" - 3Ae" + 2e" = 0. Cancel e".
Step 2 solves 1'. - 31. + 2 = 0. Factor into (A - 1)(A- 2) = 0. The exponents r, s are 1,2.
' . initial conditions give A + B = 5 and 1A 2B = 4.
Step 3 produces y = Aet + ~ e ~The
The constants are A = 6 and B = - 1. The solution is y = 6et - elt.

+

This solution grows because there is a positive A. The equation is "unstable." It
becomes stable when the middle term - 3y' is changed to + 3y'. When the damping
is positive the solution decays. The 1's are negative:

+

EXAMPLE 8 (A2 31 + 2) factors into (1 + 1)(1+ 2). The exponents are - 1 and -2.
The solution is y = Ae-' + Be-2t. It decays to zero for any initial condition.

cos t + b sin t).

(5)

At t = 0 this produces yo = a. Then matching yb leads to b.
Example 10 has r = s = - 1 (repeated root). One solution is e-' as usual. The
second solution cannot be another e-'. Problem 21 shows that it is te-'-again the
exceptional case multiplies by t! The general solution is y = Ae-' Bte-'.

+

Without the damping term 2yf,these examples are y" + 2y = 0 or y" + y = 0-pure
oscillation. A small amount of damping mixes oscillation and decay. Large damping
gives pure decay. The borderline is when A is repeated (r = s). That occurs when
b2 - 4ac in the square root is zero. The borderline between two real roots and two
complex roots is two repeated roots.
The method of solution comes down to one idea: Substitute y = eU.The equations
apply to mechanical vibrations and electrical circuits (also other things, but those
two are of prime importance). While describing these applications I will collect the
information that comes from A.
SPRINGS AND CIRCUITS: MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING

A mass is hanging from a spring. We pull it down an extra distance yo and give it a
starting velocity yb. The mass moves up or down, obeying Newton's law: mass times
acceleration equals spring force plus damping force:
my" = - ky - dy'

or

my" + dy' + ky = 0.

(6)

This is free oscillation. The spring force - ky is proportional to the stretching y
(Hooke's law). The damping acts like a shock absorber or air resistance-it takes
out energy. Whether the system goes directly toward zero or swings back and forth
is decided by the three numbers m, d, k. They were previously called a, b, c.
16A The solutions e" to my" + dy' + ky = 0 are controlled by the roots of
mA2 d l + k = 0. With d > 0 there is damping and decay. From J62-4mk
there may be oscillation:

+

overdamping: d > 4mk gives real roots and pure decay (Example 8)
underdamping: d < 4mk gives complex roots and oscillation (Example 9)

I

critical damping: d2 = 4mk gives a real repeated root -d/2m (Example 10)

We are using letters when the examples had numbers, but the results are the same:

Overdamping has no imaginary parts or oscillations:y = Ae" + Bes'. Critical damping
has r = s and an exceptional solution with an extra t: y = Ae" + Bte". (This is only a
solution when r = s.) Underdamping has decay from - d/2m and oscillation from the
imaginary part. An undamped spring (d = 0) has pure oscillation at the natural frequency wo =
AN these possibilities are in Figure 16.2, created by Alar Toomre. At the top is pure
oscillation (d = 0 and y = cos 2t). The equation is y" + dy' + 4y = 0 and d starts to
grow. When d reaches 4, the quadratic is A2 + 41 + 4 or (1 + 2)2. The repeated root

yields e-2t and te-2t. After that the oscillation is gone. There is a smooth transition

from one case to the next-as complex roots join in the repeated root and split into
real roots.
At the bottom right, the final value y(27n) increases with large damping. This was
a surprise. At d = 5 the roots are -1 and - 4. At d = 8.5 the roots are - ' and - 8.
The small root gives slow decay (like molasses). As d -+ oo the solution approaches

y= 1.
If we are serious about using mathematics, we should take advantage of anything
that helps. For second-order equations, the formulas look clumsy but the examples
are quite neat. The idea of e"' is absolutely basic. The good thing is that electrical
circuits satisfy the same eqution. There is a beautiful analogy between springs and
circuits:
, inductance L

mass m
damping constant d

*-

elastic constant k

-

resistance R
1/(capacitance C)

The resistor takes out energy as the shock absorber did-converting into heat by
friction. Without resistance we have pure oscillation. Electric charge is stored in
the capacitor (like potential energy). It is released as current (like kinetic energy).
It is stored up again (like a stretched spring). This continues at a frequency
c0 = 1/-LC (like the spring's natural frequency

k/r). These analogies turn

mechanical engineers into electrical engineers and vice versa.
The equation for the current y(t) now includes a driving term on the right:
L

dt + R y + -C y dt = applied voltage = V sin cot.

(7)

To match networks with springs, differentiate both sides of (7):
Ly" + Ry' + y/C = Vwt cos cot.

(8)

The oscillations are free when V = 0 and forced when V A0. The free oscillations
eAt are controlled by LA2 + RA + 1/C = 0.Notice the undamped case R = 0 when

16 Mathematics after Calculus

A = i/-.

This shows the natural frequency w, = l / p . Damped free oscillations are in the exercises-what is new and important is the forcing from the right
hand side. Our last step is to solve equation (8).
PARTICULAR SOLUTIONS-THE

METHOD OF UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS

The forcing term is a multiple of cos wt. The "particular solution" is a multiple
of cos o t plus a multble of sin wt. To discover the undetermined coefficients in
y = a cos cot + b sin cot, substitute into the differential equation (8):
- Lw2(a cos

wt + b sin ot) + Rw(- a sin wt + b cos wt)

+ (a cos wt + b sin wt)/C = Vw cos wt.
The terms in cos wt and the terms in sin o t give two equations for a and b:
-a

h 2 + bRw + a/C = Vw

and

-b

~ -waRw
~ + blC = 0.

(9)

EXAMPLE 11 Solve y" + y = cos o t . The oscillations are forced at frequency w. The
oscillations are free (y" + y = 0) at frequency 1. The solution contains both.

Particular solution Set y = a cos o t + b sin wt at the driving frequency w, and (9)
becomes
-aw2+O+a= 1
and
-bo2-O+b=O.

The second equation gives b = 0. No sines are needed because the problem has no
dyldt. The first equation gives a = 1/(1 - w2), which multiplies the cosine:
y = (cos wt)/(1 - w2) solves y" + y = cos wt.
General solution Add to this particular solution any solution to y"

(10)

+ y = 0:

Problem of resonance When the driving frequency is o = 1, the solution (1 1)
becomes meaningless-its denominator is zero. Reason: The natural frequency in
cos t and sin t is also 1. A new particular solution comes from t cos t and t sin t.
The key to success is to know the form for y. The table displays four right hand
sides and the correct y's for any constant-coefficient equation:

Right hand side
ekt
cos wt or sin o t
polynomial in t
ektcos wt or ektsin wt

Particular solution
y = Bek' (same exponent)
y = a cos a t + b sin wt (include both)
y = polynomial of the same degree
y = aektcos wt + bektsin wt

Exception If one of the roots A for free oscillation equals k or ico or 0 or k + iw, the
corresponding y in the table is wrong. The proposed solution would give zero on the
right hand side. The correct form for y includes an extra t. All particular solutions
are computed by substituting into the differential equation.
Apology Constant-coefficient equations hardly use calculus (only e"). They reduce
directly to algebra (substitute y, solve for iland a and b). I find the S-curve from the
logistic equation much more remarkable. The nonlinearity of epidemics or heartbeats
or earthquakes demands all the calculus we know. The solution is not so predictable.
The extreme of unpredictability came when Lorenz studied weather prediction and
discovered chaos.

NUMERICAL METHODS

Those four pages explained how to solve linear equations with constant coefficients:
Substitute y = eat. The list of special solutions becomes longer in a course on
differential equations. But for most nonlinear problems we enter another worldwhere solutions are numerical and approximate, not exact.
In actual practice, numerical methods for dyldt =f (t, y) divide in two groups:
1. Single-step methods like Euler and Runge-Kutta
2. Multistep methods like Adams-Bashforth
The unknown y and the right side f can be vectors with n components. The notation
stays the same: the step is At = h, the time t, is nh, and y, is the approximation to
the true y at that time. We test the first step, to find y, from yo = 1. The equation is
dyldt = y, so the right side is f = y and the true solution is y = et.
Notice how the first value off (in this case 1) is used inside the second f:

TEST

+ +h[l+ (1 + h)] = 1 + h + $h2

At time h the true solution equals eh. Its infinite series is correct through h2
for Improved Euler (a second-order method). The ordinary Euler method
yn+ = yn hf (t,, y,) is first-order. TEST: y, = 1 + h. Now try Runge-Kutta
(a fourth-order method):

Now the first value off is used in the second (for k,), the second is used in the third,
and then k3 is used in k,. The programming is easy. Check the accuracy with another

Stability is the key requirement for any method. Now the good test is y' = - y. The
solution should decay and not blow up. Section 6.6 showed how a large time step
makes Euler's method unstable-the same will happen for more accurate formulas.
The price of total stability is an "implicit method" like y, = yo + + h ( ~ b y;),
where the unknown y, appears also in y; . There is an equation to be solved at every
step. Calculus is ending as it started-with the methods of Isaac Newton.

Discrete Mathematics: Algorithms
Discrete mathematics is not like calculus. Everything isfinite. I can start with the 50
states of the U.S. I ask if Maine is connected to California, by a path through
neighboring states. You say yes. I ask for the shortest path (fewest states on the way).
You get a map and try all possibilities (not really all-but your answer is right). Then
I close all boundaries between states like Illinois and Indiana, because one has an
even number of letters and the other has an odd number. Is New York still connected
to Washington? You ask what kind of game this is-but I hope you will read on.
Far from being dumb, or easy, or useless, discrete mathematics asks good questions.
It is important to know the fastest way across the country. It is more important to
know the fastest way through a phone network. When you call long distance, a quick
connection has to be found. Some lines are tied up, like Illinois to Indiana, and there
is no way to try every route.
'

The example connects New York to New Jersey (7 letters and 9). Washington is
connected to Oregon (10 letters and 6). As you read those words, your mind jumps
to this fact-there is no path from New York with 7 letters to Washington with 10.
Somewhere you must get stuck. There might be a path between all states with an
odd number of letters-I doubt it. Graph theory gives a way to find out.
GRAPHS

A model for a large part of finite mathematics is a graph. It is not the graph of
y =f(x). The word "graph" is used in a totally different way, for a collection of nodes
and edges. The nodes are like the 50 states. The edges go between two nodes-the
neighboring states. A network of computers fits this model. So do the airline connections between cities. A pair of cities may or may not have an edge between themdepending on flight schedules. The model is determined by V and E.

16 Mathematics after Calculus

DEFINITION A graph is a set V of nodes (or vertices) and a set E of edges.
EXAMPLE 1 How many edges are possible with n nodes, in a complete graph?

The first node has edges to the n - 1 other nodes. (An edge to itself is not allowed.)
The second node has n - 2 new edges. The third node has another n - 3. The total
count of edges, when none are missing, is the sum from Section 5.3:

+ + --- + (n - 1) = in(n - 1)

1 2

edges in a complete graph.

Fifty states have 25 -49 = 1225 possible edges. The "neighboring states graph" has
less than 200. A line of 6 nodes has 5 edges, out of 4 6 5 = 15 possible.
EXAMPLE 2 Which states with an odd number of letters are reachable from New
York? Boundaries to states like Pennsylvania (12 letters) are closed.

Method of solution Start from New York (7). There is an edge to Connecticut (11).
That touches Massachusetts (13), which is a neighbor of Vermont (7). But we missed
Rhode Island, and how do we get back? The order depends on our search methodand two methods are specially important.
Depth f i s t search (DFS) "From the current state, go to one new state if possible."
But what do we do from Vermont, when New Hampshire (12) is not allowed? The
answer is: backtrack to Massachusetts. That becomes the next current state.
We label every state as we reach it, to show which state we came from. Then VT
has the label MA, and we easily cross back. From MA we go to RI. Then backtrack
to MA and CT and NY. At every step I searched for a new state with no success.
From NY we see NJ (9). Finally we are in a corner.
The depth first search is ended, by a barrier of even states. Unless we allow Ontario
and keep going to Minnesota.
Breadthfist search (BFS) "From the current state, add all possible new states to the
bottom of the list. But take the next current state from the top of the list." There is
no need to backtrack.
From NY we reach VT and MA and CT and NJ. What comes next?
Where DFS moves from the last possible state, breadth first search moves from
thefirst possible state. No move from VT is possible-so we "scan" from Massachusetts. We see Rhode Island (barely). That ends BFS.
The same six states are reached both ways. Only the order is different. DFS is last
in-&st out. BFS is f i s t in-fist out. You have the same choice in drawing a family
tree-follow a path as far as it goes and backtrack, or list all brothers and sisters
before their children. The BFS graph in Figure 16.3 is a tree. So is the DFS graph,
using forward edges only.

16.3 Discrete Mathematics: Algorithms

DEFINITION A tree is a connected graph with no loops. Its N nodes are connected
by N - 1 edges. If N = n, so every node is in the tree, it is a spanning tree.

The path from VA to KY to TN to NC to VA is a loop (or cycle). If one of those four
edges is removed, we have a tree. If two edges are removed, we have two trees (a
small forest).
EXAMPLE 3 .411ow an edge between neighboring states only when one state is even
and the other is odd. Are the lower 48 states connected?

Start anywhere-say California. Apply either type of search-maybe DFS. Go to
Arizona (7) then Utah (4) then WY (9) then CO (8) then NM then OK then TX.
(I am writing this on an airplane, looking at the map.) We will never get to Florida!
It is blocked by Alabama and Georgia.
The search creates a tree, but not a spanning tree. This graph is not connected.
An odd-to-even graph is special and important. It is called "bipartite," meaning
two parts. The odd states are in one part, the even states are in the other. All edges
go between parts. No edges are within a part.?
EXAMPLE 4 Is there a "complete matching" between 25 even and 25 odd states?
This requires neighboring states to be paired off (with no repetition).

Method 1 Start pairing them OR CA-AZ, UT-WY, NV-ID, NE-SD, WA-MT.
What about Oregon? Maybe it should have been paired with Idaho. Then Nevada
could pair with Arizona. Trial and error goes nowhere fast.
Method 2 Think first. The four states CA-OR-WA-NV are even. This whole group
is only connected to three odd states (AZ, ID, MT). The matching is impossible.

This is Hall's Theorem. In a course on graphs, it would be proved. Our purpose here
is to see the ideas and questions in discrete mathematics, more than the proofs.
THE GREEDY ALGORITHM

Put back all edges between neighboring states. The nodes could be provinces of
Canada or states of Australia. If they are countries of Europe-Asia-Africa (or the
Americas), we need a new map. The essential thing is the new problem.
In a network each edge has a "length." A positive number cij is assigned to the edge
from node i to node j. In an economics problem, cij is the cost. In a flow problem it
is the capacity, in an electrical circuit it is the conductance. We look for paths that
minimize these "lengths."
PROBLEM Find the minimum spanning tree. Connect all nodes by a tree with the
smallest possible total length.

The six cheapest highways connecting seven cities form a minimum spanning tree. It
is cheapest to build, not cheapest to drive-you have to follow the tree. Where there
tExactly half the states have an even number of letters (a real trivia question). This is the littleknown reason for admitting Alaska and Hawaii.

16 Mathematics after Calculus

is no edge we set cij = GO (or an extremely large value, in an actual code). Then the
algorithm works with a complete network-all n(n - 1)/2 edges are allowed. How
does it find the minimum spanning tree in Figure 16.3c?
Method 1 Always add the shortest edge that goes out from the current tree.
Starting from node s, this rule chooses edges of length 1,2, 7,4, 3. Now it skips 5,
which would close a loop. It chooses 6, for total length 23.
Method 2 Add edges in order, from shortest to longest. Reject an edge that closes a
loop. Several trees grow together (a forest). At the end we have a minimum spanning
tree.
This variation chooses edge lengths in the order 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 (rejecting 5), 7. In our
network both methods produce the same tree. When many edges have equal length,
there can be many shortest trees.
These methods are examples of the Greedy Algorithm: Do the best thing at every
step. Don't look ahead. Stick to a decision once it is made. In most network problems
the Greedy Algorithm is not optimal-in this spanning tree problem it is.
Method 2 looks faster than Method 1. Sort the edges by length, and go down the
list. Just avoid loops. But sorting takes time! It is a fascinating problem in itselfbubble sort or insertion sort or heapsort. We go on to a final example of discrete
mathematics and its algorithms.
PROBLEM Find the shortest path from the source node s to each other node.

The shortest path may not go along the minimum spanning tree. In the figure, the
best path going east has length 1 + 8. There is a new shortest path tree, in which the
source plays a special role as the "root."
How do we find shortest paths? Listing all possibilities is more or less insane. A
good algorithm builds out from the source, selecting one new edge at every step.
After k steps we know the distances dl, ..., d, to the k nearest nodes.
Algorithm: Minimize di + cij over all settled nodes i and all remaining nodes j.

The best new node j is a distance cij from a settled node, which is a distance di from
the source. In the example network, the first edges are 1,2,7. Next is 8. The northeast
node is closest to the source at this step. The final tree does not use edges 3, 5,6even though they are short.
These pages were written to show you the algorithmic part of discrete mathematics.
The other part is algebra-permutations, partitions, groups, counting problems,
generating functions. There is no calculus, but that's fair. The rest of the book was
written to show what calculus can do-I hope very much that you enjoyed it.
Thank you for reading, and thinking, and working.
