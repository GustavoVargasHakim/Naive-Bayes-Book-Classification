Preface
This book helps students to master the material of a standard US undergraduate
first course in Linear Algebra.
The material is standard in that the subjects covered are Gaussian reduction,
vector spaces, linear maps, determinants, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Another standard is book‚Äôs audience: sophomores or juniors, usually with
a background of at least one semester of calculus. The help that it gives to
students comes from taking a developmental approach ‚Äî this book‚Äôs presentation
emphasizes motivation and naturalness, using many examples.
The developmental approach is what most recommends this book so I will
elaborate. Courses at the beginning of a mathematics program focus less on
theory and more on calculating. Later courses ask for mathematical maturity: the
ability to follow different types of arguments, a familiarity with the themes that
underlie many mathematical investigations such as elementary set and function
facts, and a capacity for some independent reading and thinking. Some programs
have a separate course devoted to developing maturity but in any case a Linear
Algebra course is an ideal spot to work on this transition. It comes early in a
program so that progress made here pays off later but it also comes late enough
so that the classroom contains only students who are serious about mathematics.
The material is accessible, coherent, and elegant. And, examples are plentiful.
Helping readers with their transition requires taking the mathematics seriously. All of the results here are proved. On the other hand, we cannot assume
that students have already arrived and so in contrast with more advanced
texts this book is filled with illustrations of the theory, often quite detailed
illustrations.
Some texts that assume a not-yet sophisticated reader begin with matrix
multiplication and determinants. Then, when vector spaces and linear maps
finally appear and definitions and proofs start, the abrupt change brings the

students to an abrupt stop. While this book begins with linear reduction, from
the start we do more than compute. The first chapter includes proofs, such as
the proof that linear reduction gives a correct and complete solution set. With
that as motivation the second chapter does vector spaces over the reals. In the
schedule below this happens at the start of the third week.
A student progresses most in mathematics by doing exercises. The problem
sets start with routine checks and range up to reasonably involved proofs. I
have aimed to typically put two dozen in each set, thereby giving a selection. In
particular there is a good number of the medium-difficult problems that stretch
a learner, but not too far. At the high end, there are a few that are puzzles taken
from various journals, competitions, or problems collections, which are marked
with a ‚Äò?‚Äô (as part of the fun I have worked to keep the original wording).
That is, as with the rest of the book, the exercises are aimed to both build
an ability at, and help students experience the pleasure of, doing mathematics.
Students should see how the ideas arise and should be able to picture themselves
doing the same type of work.
Applications. Applications and computing are interesting and vital aspects of the
subject. Consequently, each chapter closes with a selection of topics in those
areas. These give a reader a taste of the subject, discuss how Linear Algebra
comes in, point to some further reading, and give a few exercises. They are
brief enough that an instructor can do one in a day‚Äôs class or can assign them
as projects for individuals or small groups. Whether they figure formally in a
course or not, they help readers see for themselves that Linear Algebra is a tool
that a professional must have.
Availability. This book is Free. See this book‚Äôs web page http://joshua.smcvt.
edu/linearalgebra for the license details. That page also has the latest version,
exercise answers, beamer slides, lab manual, additional material, and LATEX
source. This book is also available in a professionally printed and bound edition,
from standard publishing sources, for very little cost. See the web page.
Acknowledgments. A lesson of software development is that complex projects
have bugs, and need a process to fix them. I am grateful for reports from both
instructors and students. I periodically issue revisions and acknowledge in the
book‚Äôs source all of the reports that I use. My current contact information is on
the web page above.
I am grateful to Saint Michael‚Äôs College for supporting this project over many
years, even before the idea of open educational resources became familiar. I also
thank Adobe Color CC user claflin61 for the cover colors.
And, I cannot thank my wife Lynne enough for her unflagging encouragement.

Advice. This book‚Äôs emphasis on motivation and development, and its availability,
make it widely used for self-study. If you are an independent student then good
for you, I admire your industry. However, you may find some advice useful.
While an experienced instructor knows what subjects and pace suit their
class, this semester‚Äôs timetable (graciously shared by George Ashline) may help
you plan a sensible rate. It presumes that you have already studied the material
of Section One.II, the elements of vectors.

As enrichment, you could pick one or two extra things that appeal to you, from
the lab manual or from the Topics from the end of each chapter. I like the Topics
on Voting Paradoxes, Geometry of Linear Maps, and Coupled Oscillators. You‚Äôll
get more from these if you have access to software for calculations. I recommend
Sage, freely available from http://sagemath.org.
In the table of contents I have marked a few subsections as optional if some
instructors will pass over them in favor of spending more time elsewhere.
Note that in addition to the in-class exams, students in the above course do
take-home problem sets that include proofs, such as a verification that a set is a
vector space. Computations are important but so are the arguments.
My main advice is: do many exercises. I have marked a good sample with
X‚Äôs in the margin. Do not simply read the answers ‚Äî you must try the problems
and possibly struggle with them. For all of the exercises, you must justify your
answer either with a computation or with a proof. Be aware that few people
can write correct proofs without training; try to find a knowledgeable person to
work with you.

Finally, a caution for all students, independent or not: I cannot overemphasize
that the statement, ‚ÄúI understand the material but it is only that I have trouble
with the problems‚Äù shows a misconception. Being able to do things with the
ideas is their entire point. The quotes below express this sentiment admirably (I
have taken the liberty of formatting them as poetry). They capture the essence
of both the beauty and the power of mathematics and science in general, and of
Linear Algebra in particular.
I know of no better tactic
than the illustration of exciting principles
by well-chosen particulars.
‚ÄìStephen Jay Gould
If you really wish to learn
you must mount a machine
and become acquainted with its tricks
by actual trial.

Author‚Äôs Note. Inventing a good exercise, one that enlightens as well as tests,
is a creative act, and hard work. The inventor deserves recognition. But texts
have traditionally not given attributions for questions. I have changed that here
where I was sure of the source. I would be glad to hear from anyone who can
help me to correctly attribute others of the questions.

Solving Linear Systems

Systems of linear equations are common in science and mathematics. These two
examples from high school science [Onan] give a sense of how they arise.
The first example is from Statics. Suppose that we have three objects, we
know that one has a mass of 2 kg, and we want to find the two unknown masses.
Experimentation with a meter stick produces these two balances.
40

h

50

c

25

50

c

15

h

25

For the masses to balance we must have that the sum of moments on the left
equals the sum of moments on the right, where the moment of an object is its
mass times its distance from the balance point. That gives a system of two
linear equations.
40h + 15c = 100
25c = 50 + 50h
The second example is from Chemistry. We can mix, under controlled
conditions, toluene C7 H8 and nitric acid HNO3 to produce trinitrotoluene
C7 H5 O6 N3 along with the byproduct water (conditions have to be very well
controlled ‚Äî trinitrotoluene is better known as TNT). In what proportion should
we mix them? The number of atoms of each element present before the reaction
x C7 H8 + y HNO3

‚àí‚Üí

z C7 H5 O6 N3 + w H2 O

Chapter One. Linear Systems

must equal the number present afterward. Applying that in turn to the elements
C, H, N, and O gives this system.
7x = 7z
8x + 1y = 5z + 2w
1y = 3z
3y = 6z + 1w
Both examples come down to solving a system of equations. In each system,
the equations involve only the first power of each variable. This chapter shows
how to solve any such system of equations.

I.1

Gauss‚Äôs Method

1.1 Definition A linear combination of x1 , . . . , xn has the form
a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an xn
where the numbers a1 , . . . , an ‚àà R are the combination‚Äôs coefficients. A linear
equation in the variables x1 , . . . , xn has the form a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ +
an xn = d where d ‚àà R is the constant .
An n-tuple (s1 , s2 , . . . , sn ) ‚àà Rn is a solution of, or satisfies, that equation
if substituting the numbers s1 , . . . , sn for the variables gives a true statement:
a1 s1 + a2 s2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an sn = d. A system of linear equations
a1,1 x1 + a1,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + a1,n xn = d1
a2,1 x1 + a2,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + a2,n xn = d2
..
.
am,1 x1 + am,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + am,n xn = dm
has the solution (s1 , s2 , . . . , sn ) if that n-tuple is a solution of all of the equations.
1.2 Example The combination 3x1 + 2x2 of x1 and x2 is linear. The combination
3x21 + 2x2 is not a linear function of x1 and x2 , nor is 3x1 + 2 sin(x2 ).
We usually take x1 , . . . , xn to be unequal to each other because in a
sum with repeats we can rearrange to make the elements unique, as with
2x + 3y + 4x = 6x + 3y. We sometimes include terms with a zero coefficient, as
in x ‚àí 2y + 0z, and at other times omit them, depending on what is convenient.

3

Section I. Solving Linear Systems
1.3 Example The ordered pair (‚àí1, 5) is a solution of this system.
3x1 + 2x2 = 7
‚àíx1 + x2 = 6
In contrast, (5, ‚àí1) is not a solution.

Finding the set of all solutions is solving the system. We don‚Äôt need guesswork
or good luck, there is an algorithm that always works. This algorithm is Gauss‚Äôs
Method (or Gaussian elimination or linear elimination).
1.4 Example To solve this system
3x3 = 9
x1 + 5x2 ‚àí 2x3 = 2
1
=3
3 x1 + 2x2
we transform it, step by step, until it is in a form that we can easily solve.
The first transformation rewrites the system by interchanging the first and
third row.
swap row 1 with row 3

‚àí‚Üí

1
3 x1

+ 2x2
=3
x1 + 5x2 ‚àí 2x3 = 2
3x3 = 9

The second transformation rescales the first row by a factor of 3.
multiply row 1 by 3

‚àí‚Üí

x1 + 6x2
=9
x1 + 5x2 ‚àí 2x3 = 2
3x3 = 9

The third transformation is the only nontrivial one in this example. We mentally
multiply both sides of the first row by ‚àí1, mentally add that to the second row,
and write the result in as the new second row.
add ‚àí1 times row 1 to row 2

‚àí‚Üí

x1 + 6x2
= 9
‚àíx2 ‚àí 2x3 = ‚àí7
3x3 = 9

These steps have brought the system to a form where we can easily find the
value of each variable. The bottom equation shows that x3 = 3. Substituting 3
for x3 in the middle equation shows that x2 = 1. Substituting those two into
the top equation gives that x1 = 3. Thus the system has a unique solution; the
solution set is { (3, 1, 3) }.
We will use Gauss‚Äôs Method throughout the book. It is fast and easy. We
will now show that it is also safe: Gauss‚Äôs Method never loses solutions nor does
it ever pick up extraneous solutions, so that a tuple is a solution to the system
before we apply the method if and only if it is a solution after.

Chapter One. Linear Systems

1.5 Theorem (Gauss‚Äôs Method) If a linear system is changed to another by one of
these operations
(1) an equation is swapped with another
(2) an equation has both sides multiplied by a nonzero constant
(3) an equation is replaced by the sum of itself and a multiple of another
then the two systems have the same set of solutions.
Each of the three operations has a restriction. Multiplying a row by 0 is not
allowed because obviously that can change the solution set. Similarly, adding a
multiple of a row to itself is not allowed because adding ‚àí1 times the row to
itself has the effect of multiplying the row by 0. And we disallow swapping a
row with itself, to make some results in the fourth chapter easier. Besides, it‚Äôs
pointless.
Proof We will cover the equation swap operation here. The other two cases

are similar and are Exercise 33.
Consider a linear system.
a1,1 x1 + a1,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + a1,n xn =
..
.
ai,1 x1 + ai,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ai,n xn =
..
.
aj,1 x1 + aj,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + aj,n xn =
..
.
am,1 x1 + am,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + am,n xn =

d1
di
dj
dm

The tuple (s1 , . . . , sn ) satisfies this system if and only if substituting the values
for the variables, the s‚Äôs for the x‚Äôs, gives a conjunction of true statements:
a1,1 s1 +a1,2 s2 +¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑+a1,n sn = d1 and . . . ai,1 s1 +ai,2 s2 +¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑+ai,n sn = di and
. . . aj,1 s1 + aj,2 s2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + aj,n sn = dj and . . . am,1 s1 + am,2 s2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + am,n sn =
dm .
In a list of statements joined with ‚Äòand‚Äô we can rearrange the order of the
statements. Thus this requirement is met if and only if a1,1 s1 + a1,2 s2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ +
a1,n sn = d1 and . . . aj,1 s1 + aj,2 s2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + aj,n sn = dj and . . . ai,1 s1 + ai,2 s2 +
¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ai,n sn = di and . . . am,1 s1 + am,2 s2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + am,n sn = dm . This is exactly
the requirement that (s1 , . . . , sn ) solves the system after the row swap. QED

Section I. Solving Linear Systems

1.6 Definition The three operations from Theorem 1.5 are the elementary reduction operations, or row operations, or Gaussian operations. They are
swapping, multiplying by a scalar (or rescaling), and row combination.
When writing out the calculations, we will abbreviate ‚Äòrow i‚Äô by ‚ÄòœÅi ‚Äô. For
instance, we will denote a row combination operation by kœÅi + œÅj , with the row
that changes written second. To save writing we will often combine addition
steps when they use the same œÅi , as in the next example.
1.7 Example Gauss‚Äôs Method systematically applies the row operations to solve
a system. Here is a typical case.
x+ y
=0
2x ‚àí y + 3z = 3
x ‚àí 2y ‚àí z = 3
We begin by using the first row to eliminate the 2x in the second row and the x
in the third. To get rid of the 2x we mentally multiply the entire first row by
‚àí2, add that to the second row, and write the result in as the new second row.
To eliminate the x in the third row we multiply the first row by ‚àí1, add that to
the third row, and write the result in as the new third row.
‚àí2œÅ1 +œÅ2

x+

‚àí‚Üí

‚àíœÅ1 +œÅ3

y
=0
‚àí3y + 3z = 3
‚àí3y ‚àí z = 3

We finish by transforming the second system into a third, where the bottom
equation involves only one unknown. We do that by using the second row to
eliminate the y term from the third row.
‚àíœÅ2 +œÅ3

‚àí‚Üí

x+

y
=0
‚àí3y + 3z = 3
‚àí4z = 0

Now finding the system‚Äôs solution is easy. The third row gives z = 0. Substitute
that back into the second row to get y = ‚àí1. Then substitute back into the first
row to get x = 1.
1.8 Example For the Physics problem from the start of this chapter, Gauss‚Äôs
Method gives this.
40h + 15c = 100
‚àí50h + 25c = 50

5/4œÅ1 +œÅ2

‚àí‚Üí

40h +

15c = 100
(175/4)c = 175

So c = 4, and back-substitution gives that h = 1. (We will solve the Chemistry
problem later.)

6

Chapter One. Linear Systems

1.9 Example The reduction
x+ y+ z=9
2x + 4y ‚àí 3z = 1
3x + 6y ‚àí 5z = 0

x+ y+ z= 9
2y ‚àí 5z = ‚àí17
3y ‚àí 8z = ‚àí27

‚àí2œÅ1 +œÅ2

‚àí‚Üí

‚àí‚Üí

x+ y+
2y ‚àí

z=
9
5z =
‚àí17
‚àí(1/2)z = ‚àí(3/2)

shows that z = 3, y = ‚àí1, and x = 7.
As illustrated above, the point of Gauss‚Äôs Method is to use the elementary
reduction operations to set up back-substitution.
1.10 Definition In each row of a system, the first variable with a nonzero coefficient
is the row‚Äôs leading variable. A system is in echelon form if each leading
variable is to the right of the leading variable in the row above it, except for the
leading variable in the first row, and any all-zero rows are at the bottom.
1.11 Example The prior three examples only used the operation of row combination. This linear system requires the swap operation to get it into echelon form
because after the first combination
x‚àí y
=0
2x ‚àí 2y + z + 2w = 4
y
+ w=0
2z + w = 5

x‚àíy
‚àí2œÅ1 +œÅ2

‚àí‚Üí

y

=0
z + 2w = 4
+ w=0
2z + w = 5

the second equation has no leading y. We exchange it for a lower-down row that
has a leading y.

œÅ2 ‚ÜîœÅ3

‚àí‚Üí

x‚àíy
y

=0
+ w=0
z + 2w = 4
2z + w = 5

(Had there been more than one suitable row below the second then we could
have used any one.) With that, Gauss‚Äôs Method proceeds as before.

‚àí2œÅ3 +œÅ4

‚àí‚Üí

x‚àíy
y

= 0
+ w= 0
z + 2w = 4
‚àí3w = ‚àí3

Back-substitution gives w = 1, z = 2 , y = ‚àí1, and x = ‚àí1.

Section I. Solving Linear Systems

Strictly speaking, to solve linear systems we don‚Äôt need the row rescaling
operation. We have introduced it here because it is convenient and because we
will use it later in this chapter as part of a variation of Gauss‚Äôs Method, the
Gauss-Jordan Method.
All of the systems so far have the same number of equations as unknowns.
All of them have a solution and for all of them there is only one solution. We
finish this subsection by seeing other things that can happen.
1.12 Example This system has more equations than variables.
x + 3y = 1
2x + y = ‚àí3
2x + 2y = ‚àí2
Gauss‚Äôs Method helps us understand this system also, since this
x + 3y = 1
‚àí5y = ‚àí5
‚àí4y = ‚àí4

‚àí2œÅ1 +œÅ2

‚àí‚Üí

‚àí2œÅ1 +œÅ3

shows that one of the equations is redundant. Echelon form
‚àí(4/5)œÅ2 +œÅ3

‚àí‚Üí

x + 3y = 1
‚àí5y = ‚àí5
0= 0

gives that y = 1 and x = ‚àí2. The ‚Äò0 = 0‚Äô reflects the redundancy.
Gauss‚Äôs Method is also useful on systems with more variables than equations.
The next subsection has many examples.
Another way that linear systems can differ from the examples shown above
is that some linear systems do not have a unique solution. This can happen in
two ways. The first is that a system can fail to have any solution at all.
1.13 Example Contrast the system in the last example with this one.
x + 3y = 1
2x + y = ‚àí3
2x + 2y = 0

‚àí2œÅ1 +œÅ2

‚àí‚Üí

‚àí2œÅ1 +œÅ3

x + 3y = 1
‚àí5y = ‚àí5
‚àí4y = ‚àí2

Here the system is inconsistent: no pair of numbers (s1 , s2 ) satisfies all three
equations simultaneously. Echelon form makes the inconsistency obvious.
‚àí(4/5)œÅ2 +œÅ3

‚àí‚Üí

The solution set is empty.

x + 3y = 1
‚àí5y = ‚àí5
0= 2

8

Chapter One. Linear Systems

1.14 Example The prior system has more equations than unknowns but that
is not what causes the inconsistency ‚Äî Example 1.12 has more equations than
unknowns and yet is consistent. Nor is having more equations than unknowns
necessary for inconsistency, as we see with this inconsistent system that has the
same number of equations as unknowns.
x + 2y = 8
2x + 4y = 8

‚àí2œÅ1 +œÅ2

‚àí‚Üí

x + 2y = 8
0 = ‚àí8

Instead, inconsistency has to do with the interaction of the left and right sides;
in the first system above the left side‚Äôs second equation is twice the first but the
right side‚Äôs second constant is not twice the first. Later we will have more to
say about dependencies between a system‚Äôs parts.
The other way that a linear system can fail to have a unique solution, besides
having no solutions, is to have many solutions.
1.15 Example In this system
x+ y=4
2x + 2y = 8
any pair of numbers satisfying the first equation also satisfies the second. The
solution set { (x, y) | x + y = 4 } is infinite; some example member pairs are (0, 4),
(‚àí1, 5), and (2.5, 1.5).
The result of applying Gauss‚Äôs Method here contrasts with the prior example
because we do not get a contradictory equation.
‚àí2œÅ1 +œÅ2

‚àí‚Üí

x+y=4
0=0

Don‚Äôt be fooled by that example: a 0 = 0 equation is not the signal that a
system has many solutions.
1.16 Example The absence of a 0 = 0 equation does not keep a system from having
many different solutions. This system is in echelon form, has no 0 = 0, but
has infinitely many solutions, including (0, 1, ‚àí1), (0, 1/2, ‚àí1/2), (0, 0, 0), and
(0, ‚àíœÄ, œÄ) (any triple whose first component is 0 and whose second component
is the negative of the third is a solution).
x+y+z=0
y+z=0
Nor does the presence of 0 = 0 mean that the system must have many
solutions. Example 1.12 shows that. So does this system, which does not have

9

Section I. Solving Linear Systems
any solutions at all despite that in echelon form it has a 0 = 0 row.
2x

‚àí 2z = 6
y+ z=1
2x + y ‚àí z = 7
3y + 3z = 0

2x
‚àíœÅ1 +œÅ3

‚àí‚Üí

2x
‚àíœÅ2 +œÅ3

‚àí‚Üí

‚àí3œÅ2 +œÅ4

‚àí 2z = 6
y+ z=1
y+ z=1
3y + 3z = 0
‚àí 2z = 6
y+ z= 1
0= 0
0 = ‚àí3

In summary, Gauss‚Äôs Method uses the row operations to set a system up for
back substitution. If any step shows a contradictory equation then we can stop
with the conclusion that the system has no solutions. If we reach echelon form
without a contradictory equation, and each variable is a leading variable in its
row, then the system has a unique solution and we find it by back substitution.
Finally, if we reach echelon form without a contradictory equation, and there is
not a unique solution ‚Äî that is, at least one variable is not a leading variable ‚Äî
then the system has many solutions.
The next subsection explores the third case. We will see that such a system
must have infinitely many solutions and we will describe the solution set.
Note. In the exercises here, and in the rest of the book, you must justify all
of your answers. For instance, if a question asks whether a system has a
solution then you must justify a yes response by producing the solution and
must justify a no response by showing that no solution exists.

X 1.21 We can solve linear systems by methods other than Gauss‚Äôs. One often taught
in high school is to solve one of the equations for a variable, then substitute the
resulting expression into other equations. Then we repeat that step until there
is an equation with only one variable. From that we get the first number in the
solution and then we get the rest with back-substitution. This method takes longer
than Gauss‚Äôs Method, since it involves more arithmetic operations, and is also
more likely to lead to errors. To illustrate how it can lead to wrong conclusions,
we will use the system
x + 3y = 1
2x + y = ‚àí3
2x + 2y = 0
from Example 1.13.
(a) Solve the first equation for x and substitute that expression into the second
equation. Find the resulting y.

into the third equation. Find this y.

1.25 True or false: a system with more unknowns than equations has at least one

that could change a solution set. Give an example of a system with solution set S0

a proper subset of S1 , that is, S0 6= S1 . Give an example where S0 = S1 .

? 1.40 [Wohascum no. 2] The Wohascum County Board of Commissioners, which has
20 members, recently had to elect a President. There were three candidates (A, B,
and C); on each ballot the three candidates were to be listed in order of preference,
with no abstentions. It was found that 11 members, a majority, preferred A over
B (thus the other 9 preferred B over A). Similarly, it was found that 12 members
preferred C over A. Given these results, it was suggested that B should withdraw,
to enable a runoff election between A and C. However, B protested, and it was
then found that 14 members preferred B over C! The Board has not yet recovered
from the resulting confusion. Given that every possible order of A, B, C appeared
on at least one ballot, how many members voted for B as their first choice?

I.2

Describing the Solution Set

A linear system with a unique solution has a solution set with one element. A
linear system with no solution has a solution set that is empty. In these cases
the solution set is easy to describe. Solution sets are a challenge to describe only
when they contain many elements.
2.1 Example This system has many solutions because in echelon form
2x
+z=3
x‚àíy‚àíz=1
3x ‚àí y

+
z=
3
‚àíy ‚àí (3/2)z = ‚àí1/2
0=
0

not all of the variables are leading variables. Theorem 1.5 shows that an (x, y, z)
satisfies the first system if and only if it satisfies the third. So we can describe
the solution set {(x, y, z) | 2x + z = 3 and x ‚àí y ‚àí z = 1 and 3x ‚àí y = 4 } in this
way.
{ (x, y, z) | 2x + z = 3 and ‚àíy ‚àí 3z/2 = ‚àí1/2}

(‚àó)

This description is better because it has two equations instead of three but it is
not optimal because it still has some hard to understand interactions among the
variables.
To improve it, use the variable that does not lead any equation, z, to describe
the variables that do lead, x and y. The second equation gives y = (1/2)‚àí(3/2)z
and the first equation gives x = (3/2)‚àí(1/2)z. Thus we can describe the solution
set as this set of triples.
{ ((3/2) ‚àí (1/2)z, (1/2) ‚àí (3/2)z, z) | z ‚àà R}

(‚àó‚àó)

Compared with (‚àó), the advantage of (‚àó‚àó) is that z can be any real number.
This makes the job of deciding which tuples are in the solution set much easier.
For instance, taking z = 2 shows that (1/2, ‚àí5/2, 2) is a solution.
2.2 Definition In an echelon form linear system the variables that are not leading
are free.
2.3 Example Reduction of a linear system can end with more than one variable

x+y+z‚àíw= 1
y ‚àí z + w = ‚àí1
0= 0
0= 0

leaves x and y leading and both z and w free. To get the description that we
prefer, we work from the bottom. We first express the leading variable y in terms
of z and w, as y = ‚àí1 + z ‚àí w. Moving up to the top equation, substituting for
y gives x + (‚àí1 + z ‚àí w) + z ‚àí w = 1 and solving for x leaves x = 2 ‚àí 2z + 2w.
The solution set
{ (2 ‚àí 2z + 2w, ‚àí1 + z ‚àí w, z, w) | z, w ‚àà R }

(‚àó‚àó)

has the leading variables expressed in terms of the variables that are free.
2.4 Example The list of leading variables may skip over some columns. After
this reduction
2x ‚àí 2y

=0
z + 3w = 2
3x ‚àí 3y
=0
x ‚àí y + 2z + 6w = 4

z + 3w = 2
0=0
2z + 6w = 4

=0
z + 3w = 2
0=0
0=0

x and z are the leading variables, not x and y. The free variables are y and w
and so we can describe the solution set as {(y, y, 2 ‚àí 3w, w) | y, w ‚àà R }. For
instance, (1, 1, 2, 0) satisfies the system ‚Äî take y = 1 and w = 0. The four-tuple
(1, 0, 5, 4) is not a solution since its first coordinate does not equal its second.
A variable that we use to describe a family of solutions is a parameter. We
say that the solution set in the prior example is parametrized with y and w.
The terms ‚Äòparameter‚Äô and ‚Äòfree variable‚Äô do not mean the same thing. In the
prior example y and w are free because in the echelon form system they do not
lead. They are parameters because we used them to describe the set of solutions.
Had we instead rewritten the second equation as w = 2/3 ‚àí (1/3)z then the free
variables would still be y and w but the parameters would be y and z.

15

Section I. Solving Linear Systems

In the rest of this book we will solve linear systems by bringing them to
echelon form and then parametrizing with the free variables.
2.5 Example This is another system with infinitely many solutions.

=0
‚àí4y + z ‚àí w = 1
x + 2y
‚àí4y + z

=1
=0
‚àíw = 1

The leading variables are x, y, and w. The variable z is free. Notice that,
although there are infinitely many solutions, the value of w doesn‚Äôt vary but
is constant w = ‚àí1. To parametrize, write w in terms of z with w = ‚àí1 + 0z.
Then y = (1/4)z. Substitute for y in the first equation to get x = 1 ‚àí (1/2)z.
The solution set is {(1 ‚àí (1/2)z, (1/4)z, z, ‚àí1) | z ‚àà R}.
Parametrizing solution sets shows that systems with free variables have
infinitely many solutions. For instance, above z takes on all of infinitely many
real number values, each associated with a different solution.
We finish this subsection by developing a streamlined notation for linear
systems and their solution sets.
2.6 Definition An m√ón matrix is a rectangular array of numbers with m rows
and n columns. Each number in the matrix is an entry.
We usually denote a matrix with an upper case roman letters. For instance,
!
1 2.2 5
A=
3 4 ‚àí7
has 2 rows and 3 columns and so is a 2√ó3 matrix. Read that aloud as ‚Äútwo-bythree‚Äù; the number of rows is always stated first. (The matrix has parentheses
around it so that when two matrices are adjacent we can tell where one ends and
the other begins.) We name matrix entries with the corresponding lower-case
letter, so that the entry in the second row and first column of the above array
is a2,1 = 3. Note that the order of the subscripts matters: a1,2 6= a2,1 since
a1,2 = 2.2. We denote the set of all n√óm matrices by Mn√óm .
We do Gauss‚Äôs Method using matrices in essentially the same way that we
did it for systems of equations: a matrix row‚Äôs leading entry is its first nonzero
entry (if it has one) and we perform row operations to arrive at matrix echelon
form, where the leading entry in lower rows are to the right of those in the rows

above. We like matrix notation because it lightens the clerical load, the copying
of variables and the writing of +‚Äôs and =‚Äôs.
2.7 Example We can abbreviate this linear system

The second row stands for y ‚àí z = 0 and the first row stands for x + 2y = 4 so
the solution set is {(4 ‚àí 2z, z, z) | z ‚àà R }.
Matrix notation also clarifies the descriptions of solution sets. Example 2.3‚Äôs
{ (2 ‚àí 2z + 2w, ‚àí1 + z ‚àí w, z, w) | z, w ‚àà R } is hard to read. We will rewrite it
to group all of the constants together, all of the coefficients of z together, and
all of the coefficients of w together. We write them vertically, in one-column
matrices.

For instance, the top line says that x = 2 ‚àí 2z + 2w and the second line says
that y = ‚àí1 + z ‚àí w. (Our next section gives a geometric interpretation that
will help us picture the solution sets.)
2.8 Definition A column vector, often just called a vector, is a matrix with a
single column. A matrix with a single row is a row vector . The entries of
a vector are sometimes called components. A column or row vector whose
components are all zeros is a zero vector.
Vectors are an exception to the convention of representing matrices with
capital roman letters. We use lower-case roman or greek letters overlined with an

A zero vector is denoted ~0. There are many different zero vectors ‚Äî the one-tall
zero vector, the two-tall zero vector, etc. ‚Äî but nonetheless we will often say
‚Äúthe‚Äù zero vector, expecting that the size will be clear from the context.

x1 , . . . , xn is satisfied by

Ô£¨ .. Ô£∑
~s = Ô£≠ . Ô£∏
sn
if a1 s1 + a2 s2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an sn = d. A vector satisfies a linear system if it satisfies
each equation in the system.
The style of description of solution sets that we use involves adding the
vectors, and also multiplying them by real numbers. Before we give the examples
showing the style we first need to define these operations.

Note that for the addition to be defined the vectors must have the same
number of entries. This entry-by-entry addition works for any pair of matrices,
not just vectors, provided that they have the same number of rows and columns.

operation extends beyond vectors to apply to any matrix.

Chapter One. Linear Systems

We write scalar multiplication either as r ¬∑ ~v or ~v ¬∑ r, and sometimes even
omit the ‚Äò¬∑‚Äô symbol: r~v. (Do not refer to scalar multiplication as ‚Äòscalar product‚Äô
because that name is for a different operation.)

Observe that the definitions of addition and scalar multiplication agree where
they overlap; for instance, ~v + ~v = 2~v.
With these definitions, we are set to use matrix and vector notation to both
solve systems and express the solution.

Before the exercises, we will consider what we have accomplished and what
we will do in the remainder of the chapter. So far we have done the mechanics
of Gauss‚Äôs Method. We have not stopped to consider any of the questions that
arise, except for proving Theorem 1.5 ‚Äî which justifies the method by showing
that it gives the right answers.
For example, can we always describe solution sets as above, with a particular
solution vector added to an unrestricted linear combination of some other vectors?

20

Chapter One. Linear Systems

We‚Äôve noted that the solution sets described in this way have infinitely many
members so answering this question would tell us about the size of solution sets.
The following subsection shows that the answer is ‚Äúyes.‚Äù This chapter‚Äôs second
section then uses that answer to describe the geometry of solution sets.
Other questions arise from the observation that we can do Gauss‚Äôs Method
in more than one way (for instance, when swapping rows we may have a choice
of rows to swap with). Theorem 1.5 says that we must get the same solution set
no matter how we proceed but if we do Gauss‚Äôs Method in two ways must we
get the same number of free variables in each echelon form system? Must those
be the same variables, that is, is it impossible to solve a problem one way to get
y and w free and solve it another way to get y and z free? The third section
of this chapter answers ‚Äúyes,‚Äù that from any starting linear system, all derived
echelon form versions have the same free variables.
Thus, by the end of the chapter we will not only have a solid grounding in
the practice of Gauss‚Äôs Method but we will also have a solid grounding in the
theory. We will know exactly what can and cannot happen in a reduction.

2.23 [Cleary] A farmer with 1200 acres is considering planting three different crops,
corn, soybeans, and oats. The farmer wants to use all 1200 acres. Seed corn costs

The combination is unrestricted in that w and u can be any real numbers ‚Äî
there is no condition like ‚Äúsuch that 2w ‚àí u = 0‚Äù to restrict which pairs w, u we
can use.
That example shows an infinite solution set fitting the pattern. The other
two kinds of solution sets also fit. A one-element solution set fits because it has
a particular solution and the unrestricted combination part is trivial. That is,
instead of being a combination of two vectors or of one vector, it is a combination
of no vectors. (By convention the sum of an empty set of vectors is the zero
vector.) An empty solution set fits the pattern because there is no particular
solution and thus there are no sums of that form.

where ~p is any particular solution and where the number of vectors Œ≤

The solution description has two parts, the particular solution ~p and the
~
unrestricted linear combination of the Œ≤‚Äôs.
We shall prove the theorem with two
corresponding lemmas.
We will focus first on the unrestricted combination. For that we consider
systems that have the vector of zeroes as a particular solution so that we can

3.2 Definition A linear equation is homogeneous if it has a constant of zero, so
that it can be written as a1 x1 + a2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an xn = 0.
3.3 Example With any linear system like
3x + 4y = 3
2x ‚àí y = 1
we associate a system of homogeneous equations by setting the right side to
zeros.
3x + 4y = 0
2x ‚àí y = 0

Obviously the two reductions go in the same way. We can study how to reduce
a linear systems by instead studying how to reduce the associated homogeneous
system.
Studying the associated homogeneous system has a great advantage over
studying the original system. Nonhomogeneous systems can be inconsistent.
But a homogeneous system must be consistent since there is always at least one
solution, the zero vector.

variable u of the row below y + z + (‚àív) ‚àí v = 0 and solve for this row‚Äôs leading
variable y = ‚àíz + 2v. Iterate: on the next row up, substitute expressions found
in lower rows x + (‚àíz + 2v) + 2z + (‚àív) + v = 0 and solve for the leading variable

~ 2 of the lemma are the vectors associated with

the free variables z and v.
The prior paragraph is an example, not a proof. But it does suggest the
second point about the proof, its approach. The example moves row-by-row up
the system, using the equations from lower rows to do the next row. This points
to doing the proof by mathematical induction.‚àó
Induction is an important and non-obvious proof technique that we shall
use a number of times in this book. We will do proofs by induction in two
steps, a base step and an inductive step. In the base step we verify that the
statement is true for some first instance, here that for the bottom equation we
can write the leading variable in terms of free variables. In the inductive step
we must establish an implication, that if the statement is true for all prior cases
then it follows for the present case also. Here we will establish that if for the
bottom-most t rows we can express the leading variables in terms of the free
variables, then for the t + 1-th row from the bottom we can also express the
leading variable in terms of those that are free.
Those two steps together prove the statement for all the rows because by
the base step it is true for the bottom equation, and by the inductive step the
fact that it is true for the bottom equation shows that it is true for the next one
up. Then another application of the inductive step implies that it is true for the
third equation up, etc.
Proof Apply Gauss‚Äôs Method to get to echelon form. There may be some 0 = 0

equations; we ignore these (if the system consists only of 0 = 0 equations then
‚àó

More information on mathematical induction is in the appendix.

Section I. Solving Linear Systems

27

the lemma is trivially true because there are no leading variables). But because
the system is homogeneous there are no contradictory equations.
We will use induction to verify that each leading variable can be expressed
in terms of free variables. That will finish the proof because we can use the free
~ are the vectors of coefficients of those free
variables as parameters and the Œ≤‚Äôs
variables.
For the base step consider the bottom-most equation
am,`m x`m + am,`m +1 x`m +1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + am,n xn = 0

(‚àó)

where am,`m 6= 0. (The ‚Äò`‚Äô means ‚Äúleading‚Äù so that x`m is the leading variable
in row m.) This is the bottom row so any variables after the leading one must
be free. Move these to the right hand side and divide by am,`m
x`m = (‚àíam,`m +1 /am,`m )x`m +1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (‚àíam,n /am,`m )xn
to express the leading variable in terms of free variables. (There is a tricky
technical point here: if in the bottom equation (‚àó) there are no variables to
the right of xlm then x`m = 0. This satisfies the statement we are verifying
because, as alluded to at the start of this subsection, it has x`m written as a
sum of a number of the free variables, namely as the sum of zero many, under
the convention that a trivial sum totals to 0.)
For the inductive step assume that the statement holds for the bottom-most
t rows, with 0 6 t < m ‚àí 1. That is, assume that for the m-th equation, and
the (m ‚àí 1)-th equation, etc., up to and including the (m ‚àí t)-th equation, we
can express the leading variable in terms of free ones. We must verify that
this then also holds for the next equation up, the (m ‚àí (t + 1))-th equation.
For that, take each variable that leads in a lower equation x`m , . . . , x`m‚àít and
substitute its expression in terms of free variables. We only need expressions
for leading variables from lower equations because the system is in echelon
form, so the leading variables in equations above this one do not appear in
this equation. The result has a leading term of am‚àí(t+1),`m‚àí(t+1) x`m‚àí(t+1)
with am‚àí(t+1),`m‚àí(t+1) 6= 0, and the rest of the left hand side is a linear
combination of free variables. Move the free variables to the right side and divide
by am‚àí(t+1),`m‚àí(t+1) to end with this equation‚Äôs leading variable x`m‚àí(t+1) in
terms of free variables.
We have done both the base step and the inductive step so by the principle
of mathematical induction the proposition is true.
QED
This shows, as discussed between the lemma and its proof, that we can
parametrize solution sets using the free variables. We say that the set of

Chapter One. Linear Systems

To finish the proof of Theorem 3.1 the next lemma considers the particular
solution part of the solution set‚Äôs description.
3.7 Lemma For a linear system and for any particular solution ~p, the solution
set equals {~p + ~h | ~h satisfies the associated homogeneous system}.
Proof We will show mutual set inclusion, that any solution to the system is in

the above set and that anything in the set is a solution of the system.‚àó
For set inclusion the first way, that if a vector solves the system then it is in
the set described above, assume that ~s solves the system. Then ~s ‚àí ~p solves the
associated homogeneous system since for each equation index i,
ai,1 (s1 ‚àí p1 ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ai,n (sn ‚àí pn )
= (ai,1 s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ai,n sn ) ‚àí (ai,1 p1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ai,n pn ) = di ‚àí di = 0
where pj and sj are the j-th components of ~p and ~s. Express ~s in the required
~p + ~h form by writing ~s ‚àí ~p as ~h.
For set inclusion the other way, take a vector of the form ~p + ~h, where ~p
solves the system and ~h solves the associated homogeneous system and note
that ~p + ~h solves the given system since for any equation index i,
ai,1 (p1 + h1 ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ai,n (pn + hn )
= (ai,1 p1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ai,n pn ) + (ai,1 h1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ai,n hn ) = di + 0 = di
where as earlier pj and hj are the j-th components of ~p and ~h.

QED

The two lemmas together establish Theorem 3.1. Remember that theorem
with the slogan, ‚ÄúGeneral = Particular + Homogeneous‚Äù.

the general solution set is empty fits the General = Particular + Homogeneous
pattern too. This system illustrates.

Nonetheless, because the original system has no particular solution, its general
solution set is empty ‚Äî there are no vectors of the form ~p + ~h because there are
no ~p ‚Äôs.
3.10 Corollary Solution sets of linear systems are either empty, have one element,
or have infinitely many elements.

30

Chapter One. Linear Systems

Proof We‚Äôve seen examples of all three happening so we need only prove that

there are no other possibilities.
First observe a homogeneous system with at least one non-~0 solution ~v has
infinitely many solutions. This is because any scalar multiple of ~v also solves the
homogeneous system and there are infinitely many vectors in the set of scalar
multiples of ~v: if s, t ‚àà R are unequal then s~v 6= t~v, since s~v ‚àí t~v = (s ‚àí t)~v is
non-~0 as any non-0 component of ~v, when rescaled by the non-0 factor s ‚àí t, will
give a non-0 value.
Now apply Lemma 3.7 to conclude that a solution set
{~p + ~h | ~h solves the associated homogeneous system }
is either empty (if there is no particular solution ~p), or has one element (if there
is a ~p and the homogeneous system has the unique solution ~0), or is infinite (if
there is a ~p and the homogeneous system has a non-~0 solution, and thus by the
prior paragraph has infinitely many solutions).

The dimension on the top of the table is the simpler one. When we perform
Gauss‚Äôs Method on a linear system, ignoring the constants on the right side and
so paying attention only to the coefficients on the left-hand side, we either end
with every variable leading some row or else we find some variable that does not
lead a row, that is, we find some variable that is free. (We formalize ‚Äúignoring
the constants on the right‚Äù by considering the associated homogeneous system.)
A notable special case is systems having the same number of equations as
unknowns. Such a system will have a solution, and that solution will be unique,
if and only if it reduces to an echelon form system where every variable leads its
row (since there are the same number of variables as rows), which will happen if
and only if the associated homogeneous system has a unique solution.
3.11 Definition A square matrix is nonsingular if it is the matrix of coefficients
of a homogeneous system with a unique solution. It is singular otherwise, that
is, if it is the matrix of coefficients of a homogeneous system with infinitely many
solutions.

because the first of these homogeneous systems has a unique solution while the
second has infinitely many solutions.
x + 2y = 0
3x + 4y = 0

x + 2y = 0
3x + 6y = 0

We have made the distinction in the definition because a system with the same
number of equations as variables behaves in one of two ways, depending on
whether its matrix of coefficients is nonsingular or singular. Where the matrix
of coefficients is nonsingular the system has a unique solution for any constants
on the right side: for instance, Gauss‚Äôs Method shows that this system
x + 2y = a
3x + 4y = b
has the unique solution x = b‚àí2a and y = (3a‚àíb)/2. On the other hand, where
the matrix of coefficients is singular the system never has a unique solution ‚Äî it
has either no solutions or else has infinitely many, as with these.
x + 2y = 1
3x + 6y = 2

x + 2y = 1
3x + 6y = 3

The definition uses the word ‚Äòsingular‚Äô because it means ‚Äúdeparting from
general expectation.‚Äù People often, naively, expect that systems with the same
number of variables as equations will have a unique solution. Thus, we can think
of the word as connoting ‚Äútroublesome,‚Äù or at least ‚Äúnot ideal.‚Äù (That ‚Äòsingular‚Äô
applies to those systems that never have exactly one solution is ironic but it is
the standard term.)
3.13 Example The systems from Example 3.3, Example 3.4, and Example 3.8
each have an associated homogeneous system with a unique solution. Thus these
matrices are nonsingular.

The table above has two dimensions. We have considered the one on top: we
can tell into which column a given linear system goes solely by considering the
system‚Äôs left-hand side; the constants on the right-hand side play no role in this.
The table‚Äôs other dimension, determining whether a particular solution exists,
is tougher. Consider these two systems with the same left side but different
right sides.
3x + 2y = 5
3x + 2y = 5
3x + 2y = 5
3x + 2y = 4
The first has a solution while the second does not, so here the constants on the
right side decide if the system has a solution. We could conjecture that the left
side of a linear system determines the number of solutions while the right side
determines if solutions exist but that guess is not correct. Compare these two,
with the same right sides but different left sides.
3x + 2y = 5
4x + 2y = 4

3x + 2y = 5
3x + 2y = 4

The first has a solution but the second does not. Thus the constants on the
right side of a system don‚Äôt alone determine whether a solution exists. Rather,
that depends on some interaction between the left and right.
For some intuition about that interaction, consider this system with one of
the coefficients left unspecified, as the variable c.
x + 2y + 3z = 1
x+ y+ z=1
cx + 3y + 4z = 0
If c = 2 then this system has no solution because the left-hand side has the
third row as the sum of the first two, while the right-hand does not. If c 6= 2
then this system has a unique solution (try it with c = 1). For a system to
have a solution, if one row of the matrix of coefficients on the left is a linear
combination of other rows then on the right the constant from that row must be
the same combination of constants from the same rows.
More intuition about the interaction comes from studying linear combinations.
That will be our focus in the second chapter, after we finish the study of Gauss‚Äôs
Method itself in the rest of this chapter.

Linear Geometry

If you have seen the elements of vectors then this section is an optional
review. However, later work will refer to this material so if this is not a
review then it is not optional.
In the first section we had to do a bit of work to show that there are only
three types of solution sets ‚Äî singleton, empty, and infinite. But this is easy to
see geometrically in the case of systems with two equations and two unknowns.
Draw each two-unknowns equation as a line in the plane and then the two lines
could have a unique intersection, be parallel, or be the same line.

3x + 2y = 7
x ‚àí y = ‚àí1

3x + 2y = 7
3x + 2y = 4

3x + 2y = 7
6x + 4y = 14

These pictures aren‚Äôt a short way to prove the results from the prior section,
because those results apply to linear systems with any number of variables. But
they do provide a visual insight, another way of seeing those results.
This section develops what we need to express our results geometrically. In
particular, while the two-dimensional case is familiar, to extend to systems with
more than two unknowns we shall need some higher-dimensional geometry.

II.1

Vectors in Space

‚ÄúHigher-dimensional geometry‚Äù sounds exotic. It is exotic ‚Äî interesting and
eye-opening. But it isn‚Äôt distant or unreachable.
We begin by defining one-dimensional space to be R. To see that the definition
is reasonable, picture a one-dimensional space

and pick a point to label 0 and another to label 1.
0

1

Now, with a scale and a direction, we have a correspondence with R. For instance,

36

Chapter One. Linear Systems

to find the point matching +2.17, start at 0 and head in the direction of 1, and
go 2.17 times as far.
The basic idea here, combining magnitude with direction, is the key to
extending to higher dimensions.
An object in R, or in any Rn , comprised of a magnitude and a direction is
a vector (we use the same word as in the prior section because we shall show
below how to describe such an object with a column vector). We can draw a
vector as having some length and pointing in some direction.

There is a subtlety involved in the definition of a vector as consisting of a
magnitude and a direction ‚Äî these

are equal, even though they start in different places They are equal because they
have equal lengths and equal directions. Again: those vectors are not just alike,
they are equal.
How can things that are in different places be equal? Think of a vector as
representing a displacement (the word ‚Äòvector‚Äô is Latin for ‚Äúcarrier‚Äù or ‚Äútraveler‚Äù).
These two squares undergo displacements that are equal despite that they start
in different places.

When we want to emphasize this property vectors have of not being anchored
we refer to them as free vectors. Thus, these free vectors are equal, as each is a
displacement of one over and two up.

More generally, vectors in the plane are the same if and only if they have the
same change in first components and the same change in second components: the
vector extending from (a1 , a2 ) to (b1 , b2 ) equals the vector from (c1 , c2 ) to
(d1 , d2 ) if and only if b1 ‚àí a1 = d1 ‚àí c1 and b2 ‚àí a2 = d2 ‚àí c2 .
Saying ‚Äòthe vector that, were it to start at (a1 , a2 ), would extend to (b1 , b2 )‚Äô
would be unwieldy. We instead describe that vector as
!
b1 ‚àí a1
b2 ‚àí a2

37

Section II. Linear Geometry

so that we represent the ‚Äòone over and two up‚Äô arrows shown above in this way.
!
1
2
We often draw the arrow as starting at the origin, and we then say it is in the
canonical position (or natural position or standard position). When
!
v1
~v =
v2
is in canonical position then it extends from the origin to the endpoint (v1 , v2 ).
We will typically say ‚Äúthe point
!
1
‚Äù
2
rather than ‚Äúthe endpoint of the canonical position of‚Äù that vector. Thus, we
will call each of these R2 .

we can now understand those operations geometrically. For instance, if ~v
represents a displacement then 3~v represents a displacement in the same direction
but three times as far and ‚àí1~v represents a displacement of the same distance
as ~v but in the opposite direction.
~v
3~v
‚àí~v

And, where ~v and w
~ represent displacements, ~v+~
w represents those displacements
combined.
~v + w
~
w
~
~v

38

Chapter One. Linear Systems

The long arrow is the combined displacement in this sense: imagine that you are
walking on a ship‚Äôs deck. Suppose that in one minute the ship‚Äôs motion gives it
a displacement relative to the sea of ~v, and in the same minute your walking
gives you a displacement relative to the ship‚Äôs deck of w
~ . Then ~v + w
~ is your
displacement relative to the sea.
Another way to understand the vector sum is with the parallelogram rule.
Draw the parallelogram formed by the vectors ~v and w
~ . Then the sum ~v + w
~
extends along the diagonal to the far corner.
~v + w
~

~

The above drawings show how vectors and vector operations behave in R2 .
We can extend to R3 , or to even higher-dimensional spaces where we have no
pictures, with the obvious generalization: the free vector that, if it starts at
(a1 , . . . , an ), ends at (b1 , . . . , bn ), is represented by this column.

And, we do addition and scalar multiplication component-wise.
Having considered points, we next turn to lines. In R2 , the line through
(1, 2) and (3, 1) is comprised of (the endpoints of) the vectors in this set.

is the one shown in the picture as having its whole body in the line ‚Äî it is a

are described using negative values of t.

and lines in even higher-dimensional spaces work in the same way.
In R3 , a line uses one parameter so that a particle on that line would be
free to move back and forth in one dimension. A plane involves two parameters.
For example, the plane through the points (1, 0, 5), (2, 1, ‚àí3), and (‚àí2, 4, 0.5)
consists of (endpoints of) the vectors in this set.

is a three-dimensional linear surface. Again, the intuition is that a line permits
motion in one direction, a plane permits motion in combinations of two directions,
etc. When the dimension of the linear surface is one less than the dimension of
the space, that is, when in Rn we have an (n ‚àí 1)-flat, the surface is called a
hyperplane.
A description of a linear surface can be misleading about the dimension. For

We shall see in the Linear Independence section of Chapter Two what relationships among vectors causes the linear surface they generate to be degenerate.
We now can restate in geometric terms our conclusions from earlier. First,
the solution set of a linear system with n unknowns is a linear surface in Rn .
Specifically, it is a k-dimensional linear surface, where k is the number of free
variables in an echelon form version of the system. For instance, in the single
equation case the solution set is an n ‚àí 1-dimensional hyperplane in Rn , where
n > 1. Second, the solution set of a homogeneous linear system is a linear
surface passing through the origin. Finally, we can view the general solution
set of any linear system as being the solution set of its associated homogeneous
system offset from the origin by a vector, namely by any particular solution.

1.13 Euclid describes a plane as ‚Äúa surface which lies evenly with the straight lines
on itself‚Äù. Commentators such as Heron have interpreted this to mean, ‚Äú(A plane
surface is) such that, if a straight line pass through two points on it, the line
coincides wholly with it at every spot, all ways‚Äù. (Translations from [Heath], pp.
171-172.) Do planes, as described in this section, have that property? Does this
description adequately define planes?

Length and Angle Measures

We‚Äôve translated the first section‚Äôs results about solution sets into geometric
terms, to better understand those sets. But we must be careful not to be misled
by our own terms ‚Äî labeling subsets of Rk of the forms {~p + t~v | t ‚àà R } and
{~p + t~v + s~
w | t, s ‚àà R} as ‚Äòlines‚Äô and ‚Äòplanes‚Äô doesn‚Äôt make them act like the
lines and planes of our past experience. Rather, we must ensure that the names
suit the sets. While we can‚Äôt prove that the sets satisfy our intuition ‚Äî we

43

Section II. Linear Geometry

can‚Äôt prove anything about intuition ‚Äî in this subsection we‚Äôll observe that a
result familiar from R2 and R3 , when generalized to arbitrary Rn , supports the
idea that a line is straight and a plane is flat. Specifically, we‚Äôll see how to do
Euclidean geometry in a ‚Äòplane‚Äô by giving a definition of the angle between two
Rn vectors, in the plane that they generate.
2.1 Definition The length of a vector ~v ‚àà Rn is the square root of the sum of the
squares of its components.
q
|~v | = v21 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + v2n
2.2 Remark This is a natural generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem. A
classic motivating discussion is in [Polya].
For any nonzero ~v, the vector ~v/|~v| has length one. We say that the second
normalizes ~v to length one.
We can use that to get a formula for the angle between two vectors. Consider
two vectors in R3 where neither is a multiple of the other

~v

~u

(the special case of multiples will turn out below not to be an exception). They
determine a two-dimensional plane ‚Äî for instance, put them in canonical position
and take the plane formed by the origin and the endpoints. In that plane consider
the triangle with sides ~u, ~v, and ~u ‚àí ~v.

Apply the Law of Cosines: |~u ‚àí ~v |2 = |~u |2 + |~v |2 ‚àí 2 |~u | |~v | cos Œ∏ where Œ∏ is the
angle between the vectors. The left side gives
(u1 ‚àí v1 )2 + (u2 ‚àí v2 )2 + (u3 ‚àí v3 )2
= (u21 ‚àí 2u1 v1 + v21 ) + (u22 ‚àí 2u2 v2 + v22 ) + (u23 ‚àí 2u3 v3 + v23 )
while the right side gives this.
(u21 + u22 + u23 ) + (v21 + v22 + v23 ) ‚àí 2 |~u | |~v | cos Œ∏

44

Chapter One. Linear Systems

Canceling squares u21 , . . . , v23 and dividing by 2 gives a formula for the angle.
Œ∏ = arccos(

u 1 v1 + u 2 v2 + u 3 v3
)
|~u | |~v |

In higher dimensions we cannot draw pictures as above but we can instead
make the argument analytically. First, the form of the numerator is clear; it
comes from the middle terms of (ui ‚àí vi )2 .
2.3 Definition The dot product (or inner product or scalar product ) of two
n-component real vectors is the linear combination of their components.
~u ‚Ä¢ ~v = u1 v1 + u2 v2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + un vn
Note that the dot product of two vectors is a real number, not a vector, and
that the dot product is only defined if the two vectors have the same number
of components. Note also that dot product is related to length: ~u ‚Ä¢ ~u =
u1 u1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + un un = |~u |2 .
2.4 Remark Some authors require that the first vector be a row vector and that
the second vector be a column vector. We shall not be that strict and will allow
the dot product operation between two column vectors.
Still reasoning analytically but guided by the pictures, we use the next
theorem to argue that the triangle formed by the line segments making the
bodies of ~u, ~v, and ~u + ~v in Rn lies in the planar subset of Rn generated by ~u
and ~v (see the figure below).
2.5 Theorem (Triangle Inequality) For any ~u,~v ‚àà Rn ,
|~u + ~v | 6 |~u | + |~v |
with equality if and only if one of the vectors is a nonnegative scalar multiple of
the other one.
This is the source of the familiar saying, ‚ÄúThe shortest distance between two
points is in a straight line.‚Äù

Proof (We‚Äôll use some algebraic properties of dot product that we have not yet

~ + ~u ‚Ä¢ ~b and that ~u ‚Ä¢ ~v = ~v ‚Ä¢ ~u. See

Exercise 18.) Since all the numbers are positive, the inequality holds if and only
if its square holds.
|~u + ~v |2 6 ( |~u | + |~v | )2

2 ~u ‚Ä¢ ~v 6 2 |~u | |~v |
That, in turn, holds if and only if the relationship obtained by multiplying both
sides by the nonnegative numbers |~u | and |~v |
2 ( |~v | ~u ) ‚Ä¢ ( |~u |~v ) 6 2 |~u |2 |~v |2
and rewriting
0 6 |~u |2 |~v |2 ‚àí 2 ( |~v | ~u ) ‚Ä¢ ( |~u |~v ) + |~u |2 |~v |2
is true. But factoring shows that it is true
0 6 ( |~u |~v ‚àí |~v | ~u ) ‚Ä¢ ( |~u |~v ‚àí |~v | ~u )
since it only says that the square of the length of the vector |~u |~v ‚àí |~v | ~u is not
negative. As for equality, it holds when, and only when, |~u |~v ‚àí |~v | ~u is ~0. The
check that |~u |~v = |~v | ~u if and only if one vector is a nonnegative real scalar
multiple of the other is easy.
QED
This result supports the intuition that even in higher-dimensional spaces,
lines are straight and planes are flat. We can easily check from the definition
that linear surfaces have the property that for any two points in that surface,
the line segment between them is contained in that surface. But if the linear
surface were not flat then that would allow for a shortcut.
P

Q

Because the Triangle Inequality says that in any Rn the shortest cut between
two endpoints is simply the line segment connecting them, linear surfaces have
no bends.
Back to the definition of angle measure. The heart of the Triangle Inequality‚Äôs
proof is the ~u ‚Ä¢ ~v 6 |~u | |~v | line. We might wonder if some pairs of vectors satisfy
the inequality in this way: while ~u ‚Ä¢ ~v is a large number, with absolute value
bigger than the right-hand side, it is a negative large number. The next result
says that does not happen.

46

2.6 Corollary (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality) For any ~u,~v ‚àà Rn ,
| ~u ‚Ä¢ ~v | 6 | ~u | |~v |
with equality if and only if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other.
Proof The Triangle Inequality‚Äôs proof shows that ~
u ‚Ä¢ ~v 6 |~u | |~v | so if ~u ‚Ä¢ ~v is

positive or zero then we are done. If ~u ‚Ä¢ ~v is negative then this holds.
| ~u ‚Ä¢ ~v | = ‚àí( ~u ‚Ä¢ ~v ) = (‚àí~u ) ‚Ä¢ ~v 6 |‚àí~u | |~v | = |~u | |~v |
The equality condition is Exercise 19.

QED

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality assures us that the next definition makes
sense because the fraction has absolute value less than or equal to one.
2.7 Definition The angle between two nonzero vectors ~u,~v ‚àà Rn is
Œ∏ = arccos(

~u ‚Ä¢ ~v
)
|~u | |~v |

(if either is the zero vector then we take the angle to be a right angle).
2.8 Corollary Vectors from Rn are orthogonal, that is, perpendicular, if and only
if their dot product is zero. They are parallel if and only if their dot product
equals the product of their lengths.
2.9 Example These vectors are orthogonal.

the two planes are that way only in the weak sense that there are vectors in each
orthogonal to all vectors in the other. Not every vector in each is orthogonal to
all vectors in the other.

first row combination the matrix is already in echelon form but it is nonetheless
a legal row operation).
In this chapter‚Äôs first section we noted that this raises questions. Will any two
echelon form versions of a linear system have the same number of free variables?
If yes, will the two have exactly the same free variables? In this section we will
give a way to decide if one linear system can be derived from another by row
operations. The answers to both questions, both ‚Äúyes,‚Äù will follow from that.

This extension of Gauss‚Äôs Method is the Gauss-Jordan Method or GaussJordan reduction.
1.3 Definition A matrix or linear system is in reduced echelon form if, in addition
to being in echelon form, each leading entry is a 1 and is the only nonzero entry
in its column.
The cost of using Gauss-Jordan reduction to solve a system is the additional
arithmetic. The benefit is that we can just read off the solution set description.
In any echelon form system, reduced or not, we can read off when the system
has an empty solution set because there is a contradictory equation. We can
read off when the system has a one-element solution set because there is no
contradiction and every variable is the leading variable in some row. And, we
can read off when the system has an infinite solution set because there is no
contradiction and at least one variable is free.
However, in reduced echelon form we can read off not just the size of the
solution set but also its description. We have no trouble describing the solution
set when it is empty, of course. Example 1.1 and 1.2 show how in a single

52

element solution set case the single element is in the column of constants. The
next example shows how to read the parametrization of an infinite solution set.

Thus, echelon form isn‚Äôt some kind of one best form for systems. Other
forms, such as reduced echelon form, have advantages and disadvantages. Instead
of picturing linear systems (and the associated matrices) as things we operate
on, always directed toward the goal of echelon form, we can think of them as
interrelated, where we can get from one to another by row operations. The rest
of this subsection develops this thought.
1.5 Lemma Elementary row operations are reversible.
Proof For any matrix A, the effect of swapping rows is reversed by swapping

them back, multiplying a row by a nonzero k is undone by multiplying by 1/k,
and adding a multiple of row i to row j (with i 6= j) is undone by subtracting
the same multiple of row i from row j.

is that the term ‚Äòreduces to‚Äô is misleading: where A ‚àí‚Üí B, we shouldn‚Äôt think
of B as after A or simpler than A. Instead we should think of the two matrices
as interrelated. Below is a picture. It shows the matrices from the start of this
section and their reduced echelon form version in a cluster, as inter-reducible.

We say that matrices that reduce to each other are equivalent with respect
to the relationship of row reducibility. The next result justifies this, using the
definition of an equivalence.‚àó
1.6 Lemma Between matrices, ‚Äòreduces to‚Äô is an equivalence relation.
Proof We must check the conditions (i) reflexivity, that any matrix reduces

to itself, (ii) symmetry, that if A reduces to B then B reduces to A, and
(iii) transitivity, that if A reduces to B and B reduces to C then A reduces to C.
Reflexivity is easy; any matrix reduces to itself in zero-many operations.
The relationship is symmetric by the prior lemma ‚Äî if A reduces to B by
some row operations then also B reduces to A by reversing those operations.
For transitivity, suppose that A reduces to B and that B reduces to C.
Following the reduction steps from A ‚Üí ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚Üí B with those from B ‚Üí ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚Üí C
gives a reduction from A to C.

1.7 Definition Two matrices that are interreducible by elementary row operations
are row equivalent.
The diagram below shows the collection of all matrices as a box. Inside that
box each matrix lies in a class. Matrices are in the same class if and only if they
are interreducible. The classes are disjoint ‚Äî no matrix is in two distinct classes.
We have partitioned the collection of matrices into row equivalence classes.‚Ä†

Chapter One. Linear Systems

One of the classes is the cluster of interrelated matrices from the start of this
section sketched above (it includes all of the nonsingular 2√ó2 matrices).
The next subsection proves that the reduced echelon form of a matrix is
unique. Rephrased in terms of the row-equivalence relationship, we shall prove
that every matrix is row equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon form
matrix. In terms of the partition what we shall prove is: every equivalence class
contains one and only one reduced echelon form matrix. So each reduced echelon
form matrix serves as a representative of its class.

The Linear Combination Lemma

We will close this chapter by proving that every matrix is row equivalent to one
and only one reduced echelon form matrix. The ideas here will reappear, and be
further developed, in the next chapter.
The crucial observation concerns how row operations act to transform one
matrix into another: the new rows are linear combinations of the old.

2.3 Lemma (Linear Combination Lemma) A linear combination of linear combinations is a linear combination.
Proof Given the set c1,1 x1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1,n xn through cm,1 x1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cm,n xn of

linear combinations of the x‚Äôs, consider a combination of those
d1 (c1,1 x1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1,n xn ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + dm (cm,1 x1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cm,n xn )
where the d‚Äôs are scalars along with the c‚Äôs. Distributing those d‚Äôs and regrouping
gives
= (d1 c1,1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + dm cm,1 )x1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (d1 c1,n + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + dm cm,n )xn
which is also a linear combination of the x‚Äôs.

QED

2.4 Corollary Where one matrix reduces to another, each row of the second is a
linear combination of the rows of the first.
Proof For any two interreducible matrices A and B there is some minimum

number of row operations that will take one to the other. We proceed by
induction on that number.
In the base step, that we can go from one matrix to another using zero
reduction operations, the two are equal. Then each row of B is trivially a
~i = 0 ¬∑ Œ±
combination of A‚Äôs rows Œ≤
~1 + ¬∑¬∑¬∑ + 1 ¬∑ Œ±
~i + ¬∑¬∑¬∑ + 0 ¬∑ Œ±
~ m.
For the inductive step assume the inductive hypothesis: with k > 0, any
matrix that can be derived from A in k or fewer operations has rows that are
linear combinations of A‚Äôs rows. Consider a matrix B such that reducing A to B
requires k + 1 operations. In that reduction there is a next-to-last matrix G, so
that A ‚àí‚Üí ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚àí‚Üí G ‚àí‚Üí B. The inductive hypothesis applies to this G because
it is only k steps away from A. That is, each row of G is a linear combination of
the rows of A.
We will verify that the rows of B are linear combinations of the rows of G.
Then the Linear Combination Lemma, Lemma 2.3, applies to show that the
rows of B are linear combinations of the rows of A.
If the row operation taking G to B is a swap then the rows of B are just the
rows of G reordered and each row of B is a linear combination of the rows of G.
If the operation taking G to B is multiplication of a row by a scalar cœÅi then
~ i = c~Œ≥i and the other rows are unchanged. Finally, if the row operation is
Œ≤
adding a multiple of one row to another rœÅi + œÅj then only row j of B differs from
~ j = rŒ≥i + Œ≥j , which is indeed a linear combinations
the matching row of G, and Œ≤
of the rows of G.
Because we have proved both a base step and an inductive step, the proposition follows by the principle of mathematical induction.

Chapter One. Linear Systems

We now have the insight that Gauss‚Äôs Method builds linear combinations
of the rows. But of course its goal is to end in echelon form, since that is a
particularly basic version of a linear system, as it has isolated the variables. For
instance, in this matrix

x1 has been removed from x5 ‚Äôs equation. That is, Gauss‚Äôs Method has made
x5 ‚Äôs row in some way independent of x1 ‚Äôs row.
The following result makes this intuition precise. We sometimes refer to
Gauss‚Äôs Method as Gaussian elimination. What it eliminates is linear relationships among the rows.
2.5 Lemma In an echelon form matrix, no nonzero row is a linear combination
of the other nonzero rows.
Proof Let R be an echelon form matrix and consider its non-~0 rows. First

observe that if we have a row written as a combination of the others ~œÅi =
c1~œÅ1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ci‚àí1~œÅi‚àí1 + ci+1~œÅi+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cm~œÅm then we can rewrite that equation
as
~0 = c1~œÅ1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ci‚àí1~œÅi‚àí1 + ci~œÅi + ci+1~œÅi+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cm~œÅm
(‚àó)
where not all the coefficients are zero; specifically, ci = ‚àí1. The converse holds
also: given equation (‚àó) where some ci 6= 0 we could express ~œÅi as a combination
of the other rows by moving ci~œÅi to the left and dividing by ‚àíci . Therefore we
will have proved the theorem if we show that in (‚àó) all of the coefficients are 0.
For that we use induction on the row number i.
The base case is the first row i = 1 (if there is no such nonzero row, so that
R is the zero matrix, then the lemma holds vacuously). Let `i be the column
number of the leading entry in row i. Consider the entry of each row that is in
column `1 . Equation (‚àó) gives this.
0 = c1 r1,`1 + c2 r2,`1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cm rm,`1

(‚àó‚àó)

The matrix is in echelon form so every row after the first has a zero entry in that
column r2,`1 = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = rm,`1 = 0. Thus equation (‚àó‚àó) shows that c1 = 0, because
r1,`1 6= 0 as it leads the row.
The inductive step is much the same as the base step. Again consider
equation (‚àó). We will prove that if the coefficient ci is 0 for each row index
i ‚àà { 1, . . . , k} then ck+1 is also 0. We focus on the entries from column `k+1 .
0 = c1 r1,`k+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck+1 rk+1,`k+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cm rm,`k+1

Section III. Reduced Echelon Form

59

By the inductive hypothesis c1 , . . . ck are all 0 so this reduces to the equation
0 = ck+1 rk+1,`k+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cm rm,`k+1 . The matrix is in echelon form so the
entries rk+2,`k+1 , . . . , rm,`k+1 are all 0. Thus ck+1 = 0, because rk+1,`k+1 6= 0
as it is the leading entry.
QED
With that, we are ready to show that the end product of Gauss-Jordan
reduction is unique.
2.6 Theorem Each matrix is row equivalent to a unique reduced echelon form
matrix.
Proof [Yuster] Fix a number of rows m. We will proceed by induction on the

number of columns n.
The base case is that the matrix has n = 1 column. If this is the zero matrix
then its echelon form is the zero matrix. If instead it has any nonzero entries
then when the matrix is brought to reduced echelon form it must have at least
one nonzero entry, which must be a 1 in the first row. Either way, its reduced
echelon form is unique.
For the inductive step we assume that n > 1 and that all m row matrices
having fewer than n columns have a unique reduced echelon form. Consider
an m√ón matrix A and suppose that B and C are two reduced echelon form
matrices derived from A. We will show that these two must be equal.
Let AÃÇ be the matrix consisting of the first n ‚àí 1 columns of A. Observe
that any sequence of row operations that bring A to reduced echelon form will
also bring AÃÇ to reduced echelon form. By the inductive hypothesis this reduced
echelon form of AÃÇ is unique, so if B and C differ then the difference must occur
in column n.
We finish the inductive step, and the argument, by showing that the two
cannot differ only in that column. Consider a homogeneous system of equations
for which A is the matrix of coefficients.
a1,1 x1 + a1,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + a1,n xn = 0
a2,1 x1 + a2,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + a2,n xn = 0
..
.
am,1 x1 + am,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + am,n xn = 0

(‚àó)

By Theorem One.I.1.5 the set of solutions to that system is the same as the set
of solutions to B‚Äôs system
b1,1 x1 + b1,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + b1,n xn = 0
b2,1 x1 + b2,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + b2,n xn = 0
..
.

and to C‚Äôs.

Chapter One. Linear Systems

c1,1 x1 + c1,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1,n xn = 0
c2,1 x1 + c2,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c2,n xn = 0
..
.
cm,1 x1 + cm,2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cm,n xn = 0

(‚àó‚àó‚àó)

With B and C different only in column n, suppose that they differ in row i.
Subtract row i of (‚àó‚àó‚àó) from row i of (‚àó‚àó) to get the equation (bi,n ‚àíci,n )¬∑xn = 0.
We‚Äôve assumed that bi,n 6= ci,n so xn = 0. Thus in (‚àó‚àó) and (‚àó‚àó‚àó) the n-th
column contains a leading entry, or else the variable xn would be free. That‚Äôs a
contradiction because with B and C equal on the first n ‚àí 1 columns, the leading
entries in the n-th column would have to be in the same row, and with both
matrices in reduced echelon form, both leading entries would have to be 1, and
would have to be the only nonzero entries in that column. So B = C.
QED
We have asked whether any two echelon form versions of a linear system have
the same number of free variables, and if so are they exactly the same variables?
With the prior result we can answer both questions ‚Äúyes.‚Äù There is no linear
system such that, say, we could apply Gauss‚Äôs Method one way and get y and z
free but apply it another way and get y and w free.
Before the proof, recall the distinction between free variables and parameters.
This system
x+y
=1
y+z=2
has one free variable, z, because it is the only variable not leading a row. We
have the habit of parametrizing using the free variable y = 2 ‚àí z, x = ‚àí1 + z, but
we could also parametrize using another variable, such as z = 2 ‚àí y, x = 1 ‚àí y.
So the set of parameters is not unique, it is the set of free variables that is
unique.
2.7 Corollary If from a starting linear systems we derive by Gauss‚Äôs Method two
different echelon form systems, then the two have the same free variables.
Proof The prior result says that the reduced echelon form is unique. We get

from any echelon form version to the reduced echelon form by eliminating up, so
any echelon form version of a system has the same free variables as the reduced
echelon form version.
QED
We close with a recap. In Gauss‚Äôs Method we start with a matrix and then
derive a sequence of other matrices. We defined two matrices to be related if we
can derive one from the other. That relation is an equivalence relation, called
row equivalence, and so partitions the set of all matrices into row equivalence
classes.

(There are infinitely many matrices in the pictured class, but we‚Äôve only got
room to show two.) We have proved there is one and only one reduced echelon

representatives of the classes.

The idea here is that one way to understand a mathematical situation is
by being able to classify the cases that can happen. This is a theme in this
book and we have seen this several times already. We classified solution sets of
linear systems into the no-elements, one-element, and infinitely-many elements
cases. We also classified linear systems with the same number of equations as
unknowns into the nonsingular and singular cases.
Here, where we are investigating row equivalence, we know that the set of all
matrices breaks into the row equivalence classes and we now have a way to put
our finger on each of those classes ‚Äî we can think of the matrices in a class as
derived by row operations from the unique reduced echelon form matrix in that
class.
Put in more operational terms, uniqueness of reduced echelon form lets us
answer questions about the classes by translating them into questions about
the representatives. For instance, as promised in this section‚Äôs opening, we now
can decide whether one matrix can be derived from another by row reduction.
We apply the Gauss-Jordan procedure to both and see if they yield the same
reduced echelon form.

Computer Algebra Systems
The linear systems in this chapter are small enough that their solution by hand
is easy. For large systems, including those involving thousands of equations,
we need a computer. There are special purpose programs such as LINPACK
for this. Also popular are general purpose computer algebra systems including
Maple, Mathematica, or MATLAB, and Sage.
For example, in the Topic on Networks, we need to solve this.

2i2

5i1 ‚àí 2i2

Doing this by hand would take time and be error-prone. A computer is better.
Here is that system solved with Sage. (There are many ways to do this; the
one here has the advantage of simplicity.)
sage: var('i0,i1,i2,i3,i4,i5,i6')

sage: solve(network_system, i0,i1,i2,i3,i4,i5,i6)

i4 == (5/3), i5 == 0, i6 == (7/3)]]

Accuracy of Computations
Gauss‚Äôs Method lends itself to computerization. The code below illustrates. It
operates on an n√ón matrix named a, doing row combinations using the first
row, then the second row, etc.
for(row=1; row<=n-1; row++){
for(row_below=row+1; row_below<=n; row_below++){
multiplier=a[row_below,row]/a[row,row];
for(col=row; col<=n; col++){
a[row_below,col]-=multiplier*a[row,col];
}
}
}

This is in the C language. The for(row=1; row<=n-1; row++){ .. } loop initializes row at 1 and then iterates while row is less than or equal to n ‚àí 1, each
time through incrementing row by one with the ++ operation. The other nonobvious language construct is that the -= in the innermost loop has the effect of
a[row_below,col]=-1*multiplier*a[row,col]+a[row_below,col].
While that code is a first take on mechanizing Gauss‚Äôs Method, it is naive.
For one thing, it assumes that the entry in the row,row position is nonzero. So
one way that it needs to be extended is to cover the case where finding a zero
in that location leads to a row swap or to the conclusion that the matrix is
singular.
We could add some if statements to cover those cases but we will instead
consider another way in which this code is naive. It is prone to pitfalls arising
from the computer‚Äôs reliance on floating point arithmetic.
For example, above we have seen that we must handle a singular system as a
separate case. But systems that are nearly singular also require care. Consider
this one (the extra digits are in the ninth significant place).
x + 2y = 3
1.000 000 01x + 2y = 3.000 000 01

(‚àó)

By eye we easily spot the solution x = 1, y = 1. A computer has more trouble. If
it represents real numbers to eight significant places, called single precision, then

68

Chapter One. Linear Systems

it will represent the second equation internally as 1.000 000 0x + 2y = 3.000 000 0,
losing the digits in the ninth place. Instead of reporting the correct solution,
this computer will think that the two equations are equal and it will report that
the system is singular.
For some intuition about how the computer could come up with something
that far off, consider this graph of the system.

(1, 1)

We cannot tell the two lines apart; this system is nearly singular in the sense that
the two lines are nearly the same line. This gives the system (‚àó) the property
that a small change in an equation can cause a large change in the solution. For
instance, changing the 3.000 000 01 to 3.000 000 03 changes the intersection point
from (1, 1) to (3, 0). The solution changes radically depending on the ninth digit,
which explains why an eight-place computer has trouble. A problem that is very
sensitive to inaccuracy or uncertainties in the input values is ill-conditioned.
The above example gives one way in which a system can be difficult to
solve on a computer. It has the advantage that the picture of nearly-equal lines
gives a memorable insight into one way for numerical difficulties to happen.
Unfortunately this insight isn‚Äôt useful when we wish to solve some large system.
We typically will not understand the geometry of an arbitrary large system.
There are other ways that a computer‚Äôs results may be unreliable, besides
that the angle between some of the linear surfaces is small. For example, consider
this system (from [Hamming]).
0.001x + y = 1
x‚àíy=0

(‚àó‚àó)

The second equation gives x = y, so x = y = 1/1.001 and thus both variables
have values that are just less than 1. A computer using two digits represents
the system internally in this way (we will do this example in two-digit floating
point arithmetic for clarity but inventing a similar one with eight or more digits
is easy).
(1.0 √ó 10‚àí3 ) ¬∑ x + (1.0 √ó 100 ) ¬∑ y = 1.0 √ó 100
(1.0 √ó 100 ) ¬∑ x ‚àí (1.0 √ó 100 ) ¬∑ y = 0.0 √ó 100
The row reduction step ‚àí1000œÅ1 + œÅ2 produces a second equation ‚àí1001y =
‚àí1000, which this computer rounds to two places as (‚àí1.0 √ó 103 )y = ‚àí1.0 √ó 103 .

Topic: Accuracy of Computations

69

The computer decides from the second equation that y = 1 and with that it
concludes from the first equation that x = 0. The y value is close but the x is
bad ‚Äî the ratio of the actual answer to the computer‚Äôs answer is infinite. In
short, another cause of unreliable output is the computer‚Äôs reliance on floating
point arithmetic when the system-solving code leads to using leading entries
that are small.
An experienced programmer may respond by using double precision, which
retains sixteen significant digits, or perhaps using some even larger size. This
will indeed solve many problems. However, double precision has greater memory
requirements and besides we can obviously tweak the above to give the same
trouble in the seventeenth digit, so double precision isn‚Äôt a panacea. We need a
strategy to minimize numerical trouble as well as some guidance about how far
we can trust the reported solutions.
A basic improvement on the naive code above is to not determine the factor
to use for row combinations by simply taking the entry in the row,row position,
but rather to look at all of the entries in the row column below the row,row entry
and take one that is likely to give reliable results because it is not too small.
This is partial pivoting.
For example, to solve the troublesome system (‚àó‚àó) above we start by looking
at both equations for a best entry to use, and take the 1 in the second equation
as more likely to give good results. The combination step of ‚àí.001œÅ2 + œÅ1
gives a first equation of 1.001y = 1, which the computer will represent as
(1.0 √ó 100 )y = 1.0 √ó 100 , leading to the conclusion that y = 1 and, after backsubstitution, that x = 1, both of which are close to right. We can adapt the
code from above to do this.
for(row=1; row<=n-1; row++){
/* find the largest entry in this column (in row max) */
max=row;
for(row_below=row+1; row_below<=n; row_below++){
if (abs(a[row_below,row]) > abs(a[max,row]));
max = row_below;
}
/* swap rows to move that best entry up */
for(col=row; col<=n; col++){
temp=a[row,col];
a[row,col]=a[max,col];
a[max,col]=temp;
}
/* proceed as before */
for(row_below=row+1; row_below<=n; row_below++){
multiplier=a[row_below,row]/a[row,row];
for(col=row; col<=n; col++){
a[row_below,col]-=multiplier*a[row,col];
}
}
}

A full analysis of the best way to implement Gauss‚Äôs Method is beyond the
scope of this book (see [Wilkinson 1965]), but the method recommended by

70

Chapter One. Linear Systems

most experts first finds the best entry among the candidates and then scales it
to a number that is less likely to give trouble. This is scaled partial pivoting.
In addition to returning a result that is likely to be reliable, most well-done
code will return a conditioning number that describes the factor by which
uncertainties in the input numbers could be magnified to become inaccuracies
in the results returned (see [Rice]).
The lesson is that just because Gauss‚Äôs Method always works in theory, and
just because computer code correctly implements that method, doesn‚Äôt mean
that the answer is reliable. In practice, always use a package where experts have
worked hard to counter what can go wrong.

(a) Show that the machine will compute (2/3) + ((2/3) ‚àí (1/3)) as unequal to

5 Ill-conditioning is not only dependent on the matrix of coefficients. This example

an exact cancellation of the integer parts on the right side as well as on the left.
(b) Solve the system by hand, rounding to two decimal places, and with Œµ = 0.001.

The designer of such a network needs to answer questions such as: how much
electricity flows when both the hi-beam headlights and the brake lights are on?
We will use linear systems to analyze simple electrical networks.
For the analysis we need two facts about electricity and two facts about
electrical networks.
The first fact is that a battery is like a pump, providing a force impelling
the electricity to flow, if there is a path. We say that the battery provides a
potential. For instance, when the driver steps on the brake then the switch
makes contact and so makes a circuit on the left side of the diagram, which
includes the brake lights. Once the circuit exists, the battery‚Äôs force creates a
current flowing through that circuit, lighting the lights.
The second electrical fact is that in some kinds of network components the
amount of flow is proportional to the force provided by the battery. That is, for
each such component there is a number, it‚Äôs resistance, such that the potential

72

Chapter One. Linear Systems

is equal to the flow times the resistance. Potential is measured in volts, the
rate of flow is in amperes, and resistance to the flow is in ohms; these units are
defined so that volts = amperes ¬∑ ohms.
Components with this property, that the voltage-amperage response curve is a
line through the origin, are resistors. For example, if a resistor measures 2 ohms
then wiring it to a 12 volt battery results in a flow of 6 amperes. Conversely, if
electrical current of 2 amperes flows through that resistor then there must be
a 4 volt potential difference between it‚Äôs ends. This is the voltage drop across
the resistor. One way to think of the electrical circuits that we consider here is
that the battery provides a voltage rise while the other components are voltage
drops.
The facts that we need about networks are Kirchoff ‚Äôs Current Law, that for
any point in a network the flow in equals the flow out and Kirchoff ‚Äôs Voltage
Law, that around any circuit the total drop equals the total rise.
We start with the network below. It has a battery that provides the potential
to flow and three resistors, shown as zig-zags. When components are wired one
after another, as here, they are in series.

20 volt
potential

2 ohm
resistance
3 ohm

5 ohm

By Kirchoff‚Äôs Voltage Law, because the voltage rise is 20 volts, the total voltage
drop must also be 20 volts. Since the resistance from start to finish is 10 ohms
(the resistance of the wire connecting the components is negligible), the current
is (20/10) = 2 amperes. Now, by Kirchhoff‚Äôs Current Law, there are 2 amperes
through each resistor. Therefore the voltage drops are: 4 volts across the 2 ohm
resistor, 10 volts across the 5 ohm resistor, and 6 volts across the 3 ohm resistor.
The prior network is simple enough that we didn‚Äôt use a linear system but
the next one is more complicated. Here the resistors are in parallel.

20 volt

12 ohm

8 ohm

We begin by labeling the branches as below. Let the current through the left
branch of the parallel portion be i1 and that through the right branch be i2 ,

73

Topic: Analyzing Networks

and also let the current through the battery be i0 . Note that we don‚Äôt need to
know the actual direction of flow ‚Äî if current flows in the direction opposite to
our arrow then we will get a negative number in the solution.

‚Üë i0

i1 ‚Üì

‚Üì i2

The Current Law, applied to the split point in the upper right, gives that
i0 = i1 + i2 . Applied to the split point lower right it gives i1 + i2 = i0 . In
the circuit that loops out of the top of the battery, down the left branch of the
parallel portion, and back into the bottom of the battery, the voltage rise is
20 while the voltage drop is i1 ¬∑ 12, so the Voltage Law gives that 12i1 = 20.
Similarly, the circuit from the battery to the right branch and back to the
battery gives that 8i2 = 20. And, in the circuit that simply loops around in the
left and right branches of the parallel portion (we arbitrarily take the direction
of clockwise), there is a voltage rise of 0 and a voltage drop of 8i2 ‚àí 12i1 so
8i2 ‚àí 12i1 = 0.
i0 ‚àí
‚àíi0 +

i1 ‚àí i2 = 0
i1 + i2 = 0

8i2 = 20
‚àí12i1 + 8i2 = 0

The solution is i0 = 25/6, i1 = 5/3, and i2 = 5/2, all in amperes. (Incidentally,
this illustrates that redundant equations can arise in practice.)
Kirchhoff‚Äôs laws can establish the electrical properties of very complex networks. The next diagram shows five resistors, whose values are in ohms, wired
in series-parallel.

Kirchhoff‚Äôs Current Law, applied to the top node, the left node, the right node,
and the bottom node gives these.
i0 = i1 + i2

i3 + i4 = i0
Kirchhoff‚Äôs Voltage Law, applied to the inside loop (the i0 to i1 to i3 to i0 loop),
the outside loop, and the upper loop not involving the battery, gives these.
5i1 + 10i3 = 10
2i2 + 4i4 = 10
5i1 + 50i5 ‚àí 2i2 = 0
Those suffice to determine the solution i0 = 7/3, i1 = 2/3, i2 = 5/3, i3 = 2/3,
i4 = 5/3, and i5 = 0.
We can understand many kinds of networks in this way. For instance, the

(Note that to reach Jay a car must enter the network via some other road first,
which is why there is no ‚Äòinto Jay‚Äô entry in the table. Note also that over a long
period of time, the total in must approximately equal the total out, which is why
both rows add to 235 cars.) Once inside the network, the traffic may flow in different
ways, perhaps filling Willow and leaving Jay mostly empty, or perhaps flowing in
some other way. Kirchhoff‚Äôs Laws give the limits on that freedom.
(a) Determine the restrictions on the flow inside this network of streets by setting
up a variable for each block, establishing the equations, and solving them. Notice
that some streets are one-way only. (Hint: this will not yield a unique solution,
since traffic can flow through this network in various ways; you should get at
least one free variable.)
(b) Suppose that someone proposes construction for Winooski Avenue East between Willow and Jay, and traffic on that block will be reduced. What is the least
amount of traffic flow that can we can allow on that block without disrupting
the hourly flow into and out of the network?

Chapter Two

Vector Spaces
The first chapter finished with a fair understanding of how Gauss‚Äôs Method
solves a linear system. It systematically takes linear combinations of the rows.
Here we move to a general study of linear combinations.
We need a setting. At times in the first chapter we‚Äôve combined vectors from
R2 , at other times vectors from R3 , and at other times vectors from higherdimensional spaces. So our first impulse might be to work in Rn , leaving n
unspecified. This would have the advantage that any of the results would hold
for R2 and for R3 and for many other spaces, simultaneously.
But if having the results apply to many spaces at once is advantageous then
sticking only to Rn ‚Äôs is restrictive. We‚Äôd like our results to apply to combinations
of row vectors, as in the final section of the first chapter. We‚Äôve even seen some
spaces that are not simply a collection of all of the same-sized column vectors or
row vectors. For instance, we‚Äôve seen a homogeneous system‚Äôs solution set that
is a plane inside of R3 . This set is a closed system in that a linear combination
of these solutions is also a solution. But it does not contain all of the three-tall
column vectors, only some of them.
We want the results about linear combinations to apply anywhere that linear
combinations make sense. We shall call any such set a vector space. Our results,
instead of being phrased as ‚ÄúWhenever we have a collection in which we can
sensibly take linear combinations . . . ‚Äù, will be stated ‚ÄúIn any vector space . . . ‚Äù
Such a statement describes at once what happens in many spaces. To
understand the advantages of moving from studying a single space to studying
a class of spaces, consider this analogy. Imagine that the government made
laws one person at a time: ‚ÄúLeslie Jones can‚Äôt jay walk.‚Äù That would be bad;
statements have the virtue of economy when they apply to many cases at once.
Or suppose that they said, ‚ÄúKim Ke must stop when passing an accident.‚Äù
Contrast that with, ‚ÄúAny doctor must stop when passing an accident.‚Äù More
general statements, in some ways, are clearer.

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

Definition of Vector Space

We shall study structures with two operations, an addition and a scalar multiplication, that are subject to some simple conditions. We will reflect more on
the conditions later but on first reading notice how reasonable they are. For
instance, surely any operation that can be called an addition (e.g., column vector
addition, row vector addition, or real number addition) will satisfy conditions
(1) through (5) below.

I.1

Definition and Examples

1.1 Definition A vector space (over R) consists of a set V along with two
operations ‚Äò+‚Äô and ‚Äò¬∑‚Äô subject to the conditions that for all vectors ~v, w
~ , ~u ‚àà V
and all scalars r, s ‚àà R:
(1) the set V is closed under vector addition, that is, ~v + w
~ ‚ààV
(2) vector addition is commutative, ~v + w
~ =w
~ + ~v
(3) vector addition is associative, (~v + w
~ ) + ~u = ~v + (~
w + ~u)
~
~
(4) there is a zero vector 0 ‚àà V such that ~v + 0 = ~v for all ~v ‚àà V
(5) each ~v ‚àà V has an additive inverse w
~ ‚àà V such that w
~ + ~v = ~0
(6) the set V is closed under scalar multiplication, that is, r ¬∑ ~v ‚àà V
(7) addition of scalars distributes over scalar multiplication, (r+s)¬∑~v = r¬∑~v +s¬∑~v
(8) scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition, r¬∑(~v + w
~ ) = r¬∑~v +r¬∑ w
~
(9) ordinary multiplication of scalars associates with scalar multiplication,
(rs) ¬∑ ~v = r ¬∑ (s ¬∑ ~v)
(10) multiplication by the scalar 1 is the identity operation, 1 ¬∑ ~v = ~v.
1.2 Remark The definition involves two kinds of addition and two kinds of
multiplication, and so may at first seem confused. For instance, in condition (7)
the ‚Äò+‚Äô on the left is addition of two real numbers while the ‚Äò+‚Äô on the right
is addition of two vectors in V. These expressions aren‚Äôt ambiguous because
of context; for example, r and s are real numbers so ‚Äòr + s‚Äô can only mean
real number addition. In the same way, item (9)‚Äôs left side ‚Äòrs‚Äô is ordinary real
number multiplication, while its right side ‚Äòs ¬∑ ~v‚Äô is the scalar multiplication
defined for this vector space.
The best way to understand the definition is to go through the examples below
and for each, check all ten conditions. The first example includes that check,
written out at length. Use it as a model for the others. Especially important are
the closure conditions, (1) and (6). They specify that the addition and scalar

Section I. Definition of Vector Space

79

multiplication operations are always sensible ‚Äî they are defined for every pair of
vectors and every scalar and vector, and the result of the operation is a member
of the set.
1.3 Example This subset of R2 is a line through the origin.

These operations are just the ones of R2 , reused on its subset L. We say that L
inherits these operations from R3 .
We shall check all ten conditions. The paragraph having to do with addition
has five conditions. For condition (1), closure under addition, suppose that we
start with two vectors from the line L,
!
!
x1
x2
~v1 =
~v2 =
y1
y2
so that they satisfy the restrictions that y1 = 3x1 and y2 = 3x2 . Their sum
!
x1 + x2
~v1 + ~v2 =
y1 + y2
is also a member of the line L because the fact that its second component is
three times its first y1 + y2 = 3(x1 + x2 ) follows from the restrictions on ~v1
and ~v2 . For (2), that addition of vectors commutes, just compare
!
!
x1 + x2
x2 + x1
~v1 + ~v2 =
~v2 + ~v1 =
y1 + y2
y2 + y1
and note that they are equal since their entries are real numbers and real numbers
commute. (That the vectors satisfy the restriction of lying in the line is not
relevant for this condition; they commute just because all vectors in the plane
commute.) Condition (3), associativity of vector addition, is similar.

here that if ~v ‚àà L, so that y = 3x, then ‚àí~v ‚àà L also, since ‚àíy = 3(‚àíx).
The checks for the five conditions having to do with scalar multiplication
are similar. For (6), closure under scalar multiplication, suppose that r ‚àà R and

is a column array with two real entries, and so is a member of the plane R2 . In

we must check.
Condition (6) is similar. The vector
!
!

has two real entries, and so is a member of R2 .
In a similar way, each Rn is a vector space with the usual operations of vector
addition and scalar multiplication. (In R1 , we usually do not write the members
as column vectors, i.e., we usually do not write ‚Äò(œÄ)‚Äô. Instead we just write ‚ÄòœÄ‚Äô.)
1.5 Example Example 1.3 gives a subset of R2 that is a vector space. For contrast,
consider the set of two-tall columns with entries that are integers, under the
same operations of component-wise addition and scalar multiplication. This
is a subset of R2 but it is not a vector space: it is not closed under scalar
multiplication, that is, it does not satisfy condition (6). For instance, on the left
below is a vector with integer entries, and a scalar.

that it inherits from R4 .
A vector space must have at least one element, its zero vector. Thus a
one-element vector space is the smallest possible.
1.7 Definition A one-element vector space is a trivial space.
The examples so far involve sets of column vectors with the usual operations.
But vector spaces need not be collections of column vectors, or even of row
vectors. Below are some other types of vector spaces. The term ‚Äòvector space‚Äô
does not mean ‚Äòcollection of columns of reals‚Äô. It means something more like
‚Äòcollection in which any linear combination is sensible‚Äô.
1.8 Example Consider P3 = {a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 + a3 x3 | a0 , . . . , a3 ‚àà R}, the set
of polynomials of degree three or less (in this book, we‚Äôll take constant polynomials, including the zero polynomial, to be of degree zero). It is a vector space
under the operations
(a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 + a3 x3 ) + (b0 + b1 x + b2 x2 + b3 x3 )
= (a0 + b0 ) + (a1 + b1 )x + (a2 + b2 )x2 + (a3 + b3 )x3
and
r ¬∑ (a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 + a3 x3 ) = (ra0 ) + (ra1 )x + (ra2 )x2 + (ra3 )x3
(the verification is easy). This vector space is worthy of attention because these
are the polynomial operations familiar from high school algebra. For instance,
3 ¬∑ (1 ‚àí 2x + 3x2 ‚àí 4x3 ) ‚àí 2 ¬∑ (2 ‚àí 3x + x2 ‚àí (1/2)x3 ) = ‚àí1 + 7x2 ‚àí 11x3 .
Although this space is not a subset of any Rn , there is a sense in which we
can think of P3 as ‚Äúthe same‚Äù as R4 . If we identify these two space‚Äôs elements in
this way

Things we are thinking of as ‚Äúthe same‚Äù add to ‚Äúthe same‚Äù sum. Chapter Three
makes precise this idea of vector space correspondence. For now we shall just
leave it as an intuition.
In general we write Pn for the vector space of polynomials of degree n or
less {a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an xn | a0 , . . . , an ‚àà R}, under the operations of
the usual polynomial addition and scalar multiplication. We will often use these
spaces as examples.

space under the natural entry-by-entry operations.

As in the prior example, we can think of this space as ‚Äúthe same‚Äù as R4 .
We write Mn√óm for the vector space of n√óm matrices under the natural
operations of matrix addition and scalar multiplication. As with the polynomial
spaces, we will often use these as examples.
1.10 Example The set {f | f : N ‚Üí R} of all real-valued functions of one natural
number variable is a vector space under the operations
(f1 + f2 ) (n) = f1 (n) + f2 (n)

(r ¬∑ f) (n) = r f(n)

so that if, for example, f1 (n) = n2 + 2 sin(n) and f2 (n) = ‚àí sin(n) + 0.5 then
(f1 + 2f2 ) (n) = n2 + 1.
We can view this space as a generalization of Example 1.4 ‚Äî instead of 2-tall
vectors, these functions are like infinitely-tall vectors.

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

Addition and scalar multiplication are component-wise, as in Example 1.4. (We
can formalize ‚Äúinfinitely-tall‚Äù by saying that it means an infinite sequence, or
that it means a function from N to R.)
1.11 Example The set of polynomials with real coefficients
{a0 + a1 x + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an xn | n ‚àà N and a0 , . . . , an ‚àà R }
makes a vector space when given the natural ‚Äò+‚Äô
(a0 + a1 x + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an xn ) + (b0 + b1 x + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + bn xn )
= (a0 + b0 ) + (a1 + b1 )x + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (an + bn )xn
and ‚Äò¬∑‚Äô.
r ¬∑ (a0 + a1 x + . . . an xn ) = (ra0 ) + (ra1 )x + . . . (ran )xn
This space differs from the space P3 of Example 1.8. This space contains
not just degree three polynomials, but degree thirty polynomials and degree
three hundred polynomials, too. Each individual polynomial of course is of a
finite degree, but the set has no single bound on the degree of all of its members.
We can think of this example, like the prior one, in terms of infinite-tuples.
For instance, we can think of 1 + 3x + 5x2 as corresponding to (1, 3, 5, 0, 0, . . .).
However, this space differs from the one in Example 1.10. Here, each member of
the set has a finite degree, that is, under the correspondence there is no element
from this space matching (1, 2, 5, 10, . . . ). Vectors in this space correspond to
infinite-tuples that end in zeroes.
1.12 Example The set { f | f : R ‚Üí R } of all real-valued functions of one real
variable is a vector space under these.
(f1 + f2 ) (x) = f1 (x) + f2 (x)

(r ¬∑ f) (x) = r f(x)

The difference between this and Example 1.10 is the domain of the functions.
1.13 Example The set F = {a cos Œ∏ + b sin Œ∏ | a, b ‚àà R} of real-valued functions of
the real variable Œ∏ is a vector space under the operations
(a1 cos Œ∏ + b1 sin Œ∏) + (a2 cos Œ∏ + b2 sin Œ∏) = (a1 + a2 ) cos Œ∏ + (b1 + b2 ) sin Œ∏
and
r ¬∑ (a cos Œ∏ + b sin Œ∏) = (ra) cos Œ∏ + (rb) sin Œ∏
inherited from the space in the prior example. (We can think of F as ‚Äúthe same‚Äù
as R2 in that a cos Œ∏ + b sin Œ∏ corresponds to the vector with components a and
b.)

of basic Calculus. This turns out to equal the space from the prior example ‚Äî
functions satisfying this differential equation have the form a cos Œ∏ + b sin Œ∏ ‚Äî
but this description suggests an extension to solutions sets of other differential
equations.

1.15 Example The set of solutions of a homogeneous linear system in n variables is
a vector space under the operations inherited from Rn . For example, for closure
under addition consider a typical equation in that system c1 x1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn xn = 0
and suppose that both these vectors

satisfy the equation. Then their sum ~v + w
~ also satisfies that equation: c1 (v1 +
w1 ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn (vn + wn ) = (c1 v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn vn ) + (c1 w1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn wn ) = 0. The
checks of the other vector space conditions are just as routine.
We often omit the multiplication symbol ‚Äò¬∑‚Äô between the scalar and the vector.
We distinguish the multiplication in c1 v1 from that in r~v by context, since if
both multiplicands are real numbers then it must be real-real multiplication
while if one is a vector then it must be scalar-vector multiplication.
Example 1.15 has brought us full circle since it is one of our motivating
examples. Now, with some feel for the kinds of structures that satisfy the
definition of a vector space, we can reflect on that definition. For example, why
specify in the definition the condition that 1 ¬∑ ~v = ~v but not a condition that
0 ¬∑ ~v = ~0?
One answer is that this is just a definition ‚Äî it gives the rules and you need
to follow those rules to continue.

86

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

Another answer is perhaps more satisfying. People in this area have worked
to develop the right balance of power and generality. This definition is shaped
so that it contains the conditions needed to prove all of the interesting and
important properties of spaces of linear combinations. As we proceed, we shall
derive all of the properties natural to collections of linear combinations from the
conditions given in the definition.
The next result is an example. We do not need to include these properties
in the definition of vector space because they follow from the properties already
listed there.
1.16 Lemma In any vector space V, for any ~v ‚àà V and r ‚àà R, we have (1) 0 ¬∑~v = ~0,
(2) (‚àí1 ¬∑ ~v) + ~v = ~0, and (3) r ¬∑ ~0 = ~0.
Proof For (1) note that ~v = (1 + 0) ¬∑ ~v = ~v + (0 ¬∑ ~v). Add to both sides the

additive inverse of ~v, the vector w
~ such that w
~ + ~v = ~0.
w
~ + ~v = w
~ + ~v + 0 ¬∑ ~v
~0 = ~0 + 0 ¬∑ ~v
~0 = 0 ¬∑ ~v
Item (2) is easy: (‚àí1 ¬∑~v) +~v = (‚àí1 + 1) ¬∑~v = 0 ¬∑~v = ~0. For (3), r ¬∑ ~0 = r ¬∑ (0 ¬∑ ~0) =
(r ¬∑ 0) ¬∑ ~0 = ~0 will do.
QED
The second item shows that we can write the additive inverse of ~v as ‚Äò‚àí~v ‚Äô
without worrying about any confusion with (‚àí1) ¬∑ ~v.
A recap: our study in Chapter One of Gaussian reduction led us to consider
collections of linear combinations. So in this chapter we have defined a vector
space to be a structure in which we can form such combinations, subject to
simple conditions on the addition and scalar multiplication operations. In a
phrase: vector spaces are the right context in which to study linearity.
From the fact that it forms a whole chapter, and especially because that
chapter is the first one, a reader could suppose that our purpose in this book is
the study of linear systems. The truth is that we will not so much use vector
spaces in the study of linear systems as we instead have linear systems start us
on the study of vector spaces. The wide variety of examples from this subsection
shows that the study of vector spaces is interesting and important in its own
right. Linear systems won‚Äôt go away. But from now on our primary objects of
study will be vector spaces.

1.45 Example 1.5 gives a subset of R2 that is not a vector space, under the obvious
operations, because while it is closed under addition, it is not closed under scalar
multiplication. Consider the set of vectors in the plane whose components have
the same sign or are 0. Show that this set is closed under scalar multiplication but
not addition.

I.2

Subspaces and Spanning Sets

In Example 1.3 we saw a vector space that is a subset of R2 , a line through the
origin. There, the vector space R2 contains inside it another vector space, the
line.
2.1 Definition For any vector space, a subspace is a subset that is itself a vector
space, under the inherited operations.
2.2 Example This plane through the origin

Ô£¨ Ô£∑
P = { Ô£≠y Ô£∏ | x + y + z = 0 }

and scalar multiplication is also the same as in R3 . To show that P is a
subspace we need only note that it is a subset and then verify that it is a
space. We won‚Äôt check all ten conditions, just the two closure ones. For closure
under addition, note that if the summands satisfy that x1 + y1 + z1 = 0 and
x2 + y2 + z2 = 0 then the sum satisfies that (x1 + x2 ) + (y1 + y2 ) + (z1 + z2 ) =
(x1 + y1 + z1 ) + (x2 + y2 + z2 ) = 0. For closure under scalar multiplication, if
x + y + z = 0 then the scalar multiple has rx + ry + rz = r(x + y + z) = 0.
2.3 Example The x-axis in R2 is a subspace, where the addition and scalar
multiplication operations are the inherited ones.

As in the prior example, to verify directly from the definition that this is a
subspace we simply note that it is a subset and then check that it satisfies the
conditions in definition of a vector space. For instance the two closure conditions
are satisfied: adding two vectors with a second component of zero results in a
vector with a second component of zero and multiplying a scalar times a vector
with a second component of zero results in a vector with a second component of
zero.
2.4 Example Another subspace of R2 is its trivial subspace.
!

{

Any vector space has a trivial subspace {~0 }. At the opposite extreme, any
vector space has itself for a subspace. A subspace that is not the entire space is
a proper subspace.
2.5 Example Vector spaces that are not Rn ‚Äôs also have subspaces. The space of
cubic polynomials { a + bx + cx2 + dx3 | a, b, c, d ‚àà R} has a subspace comprised
of all linear polynomials { m + nx | m, n ‚àà R}.
2.6 Example Another example of a subspace that is not a subset of an Rn followed
the definition of a vector space. The space in Example 1.12 of all real-valued
functions of one real variable {f | f : R ‚Üí R} has the subspace in Example 1.14
of functions satisfying the restriction (d2 f/dx2 ) + f = 0.
2.7 Example The definition requires that the addition and scalar multiplication
operations must be the ones inherited from the larger space. The set S = { 1 } is
a subset of R1 . And, under the operations 1 + 1 = 1 and r ¬∑ 1 = 1 the set S is
a vector space, specifically, a trivial space. However, S is not a subspace of R1
because those aren‚Äôt the inherited operations, since of course R1 has 1 + 1 = 2.

92

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

2.8 Example Being vector spaces themselves, subspaces must satisfy the closure
conditions. The set R+ is not a subspace of the vector space R1 because with
the inherited operations it is not closed under scalar multiplication: if ~v = 1
then ‚àí1 ¬∑ ~v 6‚àà R+ .
The next result says that Example 2.8 is prototypical. The only way that
a subset can fail to be a subspace, if it is nonempty and uses the inherited
operations, is if it isn‚Äôt closed.
2.9 Lemma For a nonempty subset S of a vector space, under the inherited
operations the following are equivalent statements.‚àó
(1) S is a subspace of that vector space
(2) S is closed under linear combinations of pairs of vectors: for any vectors
~s1 ,~s2 ‚àà S and scalars r1 , r2 the vector r1~s1 + r2~s2 is in S
(3) S is closed under linear combinations of any number of vectors: for any
vectors ~s1 , . . . ,~sn ‚àà S and scalars r1 , . . . , rn the vector r1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + rn~sn is
an element of S.
Briefly, a subset is a subspace if and only if it is closed under linear combinations.
Proof ‚ÄòThe following are equivalent‚Äô means that each pair of statements are

equivalent.
(1) ‚áê‚áí (2)

(2) ‚áê‚áí (3)

(3) ‚áê‚áí (1)

We will prove the equivalence by establishing that (1) =‚áí (3) =‚áí (2) =‚áí (1).
This strategy is suggested by the observation that the implications (1) =‚áí (3)
and (3) =‚áí (2) are easy and so we need only argue that (2) =‚áí (1).
Assume that S is a nonempty subset of a vector space V that is closed under
combinations of pairs of vectors. We will show that S is a vector space by
checking the conditions.
The vector space definition has five conditions on addition. First, for closure
under addition, if ~s1 ,~s2 ‚àà S then ~s1 + ~s2 ‚àà S, as it is a combination of a pair
of vectors and we are assuming that S is closed under those. Second, for any
~s1 ,~s2 ‚àà S, because addition is inherited from V, the sum ~s1 + ~s2 in S equals the
sum ~s1 + ~s2 in V, and that equals the sum ~s2 + ~s1 in V (because V is a vector
space, its addition is commutative), and that in turn equals the sum ~s2 + ~s1 in
S. The argument for the third condition is similar to that for the second. For
the fourth, consider the zero vector of V and note that closure of S under linear
combinations of pairs of vectors gives that 0 ¬∑ ~s + 0 ¬∑ ~s = ~0 is an element of S
(where ~s is any member of the nonempty set S); checking that ~0 acts under the
inherited operations as the additive identity of S is easy. The fifth condition
‚àó More

information on equivalence of statements is in the appendix.

Section I. Definition of Vector Space

93

is satisfied because for any ~s ‚àà S, closure under linear combinations of pairs of
vectors shows that 0 ¬∑ ~0 + (‚àí1) ¬∑ ~s is an element of S, and it is obviously the
additive inverse of ~s under the inherited operations. The verifications for the
scalar multiplication conditions are similar; see Exercise 34.
QED
We will usually verify that a subset is a subspace by checking that it satisfies
statement (2).
2.10 Remark At the start of this chapter we introduced vector spaces as collections
in which linear combinations ‚Äúmake sense.‚Äù Theorem 2.9‚Äôs statements (1)-(3)
say that we can always make sense of an expression like r1~s1 + r2~s2 in that the
vector described is in the set S.
As a contrast, consider the set T of two-tall vectors whose entries add to
a number greater than or equal to zero. Here we cannot just write any linear
combination such as 2~t1 ‚àí 3~t2 and be confident the result is an element of T .
Lemma 2.9 suggests that a good way to think of a vector space is as a
collection of unrestricted linear combinations. The next two examples take some
spaces and recasts their descriptions to be in that form.
2.11 Example We can show that this plane through the origin subset of R3
Ô£´ Ô£∂
x
Ô£¨ Ô£∑
S = { Ô£≠yÔ£∏ | x ‚àí 2y + z = 0 }
z
is a subspace under the usual addition and scalar multiplication operations
of column vectors by checking that it is nonempty and closed under linear
combinations of two vectors. But there is another way. Think of x ‚àí 2y + z = 0
as a one-equation linear system and parametrize it by expressing the leading
variable in terms of the free variables x = 2y ‚àí z.

Now, to show that this is a subspace consider r1~s1 + r2~s2 . Each ~si is a linear
combination of the two vectors in (‚àó) so this is a linear combination of linear
combinations.

As above, we‚Äôve described the subspace as a collection of unrestricted linear
combinations. To show it is a subspace, note that a linear combination of vectors
from L is a linear combination of linear combinations and so statement (2) is
true.
2.13 Definition The span (or linear closure) of a nonempty subset S of a vector
space is the set of all linear combinations of vectors from S.
[S] = {c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn | c1 , . . . , cn ‚àà R and ~s1 , . . . ,~sn ‚àà S}
The span of the empty subset of a vector space is its trivial subspace.
No notation for the span is completely standard. The square brackets used here
are common but so are ‚Äòspan(S)‚Äô and ‚Äòsp(S)‚Äô.
2.14 Remark In Chapter One, after we showed that we can write the solution
~ 1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck Œ≤
~ k | c1 , . . . , ck ‚àà R}, we
set of a homogeneous linear system as {c1 Œ≤
~
described that as the set ‚Äògenerated‚Äô by the Œ≤‚Äôs. We now call that the span of
~ 1, . . . , Œ≤
~ k }.
{Œ≤
Recall also from that proof that the span of the empty set is defined to
be the set {~0 } because of the convention that a trivial linear combination, a
combination of zero-many vectors, adds to ~0. Besides, defining the empty set‚Äôs
span to be the trivial subspace is convenient because it keeps results like the
next one from needing exceptions for the empty set.
2.15 Lemma In a vector space, the span of any subset is a subspace.
Proof If the subset S is empty then by definition its span is the trivial subspace.

If S is not empty then by Lemma 2.9 we need only check that the span [S] is
closed under linear combinations of pairs of elements. For a pair of vectors from
that span, ~v = c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn and w
~ = cn+1~sn+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cm~sm , a linear
combination
p ¬∑ (c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn ) + r ¬∑ (cn+1~sn+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cm~sm )
= pc1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + pcn~sn + rcn+1~sn+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + rcm~sm

Section I. Definition of Vector Space

is a linear combination of elements of S and so is an element of [S] (possibly
some of the ~si ‚Äôs from ~v equal some of the ~sj ‚Äôs from w
~ but that does not matter).
QED

The converse of the lemma holds: any subspace is the span of some set,
because a subspace is obviously the span of itself, the set of all of its members.
Thus a subset of a vector space is a subspace if and only if it is a span. This
fits the intuition that a good way to think of a vector space is as a collection in
which linear combinations are sensible.
Taken together, Lemma 2.9 and Lemma 2.15 show that the span of a subset
S of a vector space is the smallest subspace containing all of the members of S.
2.16 Example In any vector space V, for any vector ~v ‚àà V, the set {r ¬∑ ~v | r ‚àà R }
is a subspace of V. For instance, for any vector ~v ‚àà R3 the line through the
origin containing that vector { k~v | k ‚àà R } is a subspace of R3 . This is true even
if ~v is the zero vector, in which case it is the degenerate line, the trivial subspace.
2.17 Example The span of this set is all of R2 .

We know that the span is some subspace of R2 . To check that it is all of R2 we
must show that any member of R2 is a linear combination of these two vectors.
So we ask: for which vectors with real components x and y are there scalars c1
and c2 such that this holds?

c2 =

‚àí2c2 = ‚àíx + y

with back substitution gives c2 = (x ‚àí y)/2 and c1 = (x + y)/2. This shows
that for any x, y there are appropriate coefficients c1 , c2 making (‚àó) true ‚Äî we
can write any element of R2 as a linear combination of the two given ones. For
instance, for x = 1 and y = 2 the coefficients c2 = ‚àí1/2 and c1 = 3/2 will do.
Since spans are subspaces, and we know that a good way to understand a
subspace is to parametrize its description, we can try to understand a set‚Äôs span
in that way.
2.18 Example Consider, in the vector space of quadratic polynomials P2 , the
span of the set S = {3x ‚àí x2 , 2x }. By the definition of span, it is the set of

96

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

unrestricted linear combinations of the two {c1 (3x ‚àí x2 ) + c2 (2x) | c1 , c2 ‚àà R }.
Clearly polynomials in this span must have a constant term of zero. Is that
necessary condition also sufficient?
We are asking: for which members a2 x2 + a1 x + a0 of P2 are there c1 and c2
such that a2 x2 + a1 x + a0 = c1 (3x ‚àí x2 ) + c2 (2x)? Polynomials are equal when
their coefficients are equal so we want conditions on a2 , a1 , and a0 making that
triple a solution of this system.
‚àíc1
= a2
3c1 + 2c2 = a1
0 = a0
Gauss‚Äôs Method and back-substitution gives c1 = ‚àía2 , and c2 = (3/2)a2 +
(1/2)a1 , and 0 = a0 . Thus as long as there is no constant term a0 = 0 we can
give coefficients c1 and c2 to describe that polynomial as an element of the
span. For instance, for the polynomial 0 ‚àí 4x + 3x2 , the coefficients c1 = ‚àí3 and
c2 = 5/2 will do. So the span of the given set is [S] = {a1 x + a2 x2 | a1 , a2 ‚àà R }.
Incidentally, this shows that the set { x, x2 } spans the same subspace. A space
can have more than one spanning set. Two other sets spanning this subspace
are {x, x2 , ‚àíx + 2x2 } and { x, x + x2 , x + 2x2 , . . . }.
2.19 Example The picture below shows the subspaces of R3 that we now know
of: the trivial subspace, lines through the origin, planes through the origin, and
the whole space. (Of course, the picture shows only a few of the infinitely many
cases. Line segments connect subsets with their supersets.) In the next section
we will prove that R3 has no other kind of subspace, so in fact this lists them all.
This describes each subspace as the span of a set with a minimal number
of members. With this, the subspaces fall naturally into levels ‚Äî planes on one
level, lines on another, etc.

So far in this chapter we have seen that to study the properties of linear
combinations, the right setting is a collection that is closed under these combinations. In the first subsection we introduced such collections, vector spaces,
and we saw a great variety of examples. In this subsection we saw still more
spaces, ones that are subspaces of others. In all of the variety there is a commonality. Example 2.19 above brings it out: vector spaces and subspaces are
best understood as a span, and especially as a span of a small number of vectors.
The next section studies spanning sets that are minimal.

2.31 An example following the definition of a vector space shows that the solution
set of a homogeneous linear system is a vector space. In the terminology of this
subsection, it is a subspace of Rn where the system has n variables. What about
a non-homogeneous linear system; do its solutions form a subspace (under the
inherited operations)?

so.
(a) A nonempty subset of M2√ó2 that is not a subspace.

2.36 Show that for any subset S of a vector space, the span of the span equals the

Members of [[S]] are linear combinations of linear combinations of members of S.)
2.37 All of the subspaces that we‚Äôve seen in some way use zero in their description.
For example, the subspace in Example 2.3 consists of all the vectors from R2 with
a second component of zero. In contrast, the collection of vectors from R2 with a
second component of one does not form a subspace (it is not closed under scalar
multiplication). Another example is Example 2.2, where the condition on the
vectors is that the three components add to zero. If the condition there were that
the three components add to one then it would not be a subspace (again, it would
fail to be closed). However, a reliance on zero is not strictly necessary. Consider

Linear Independence

The prior section shows how to understand a vector space as a span, as an
unrestricted linear combination of some of its elements. For example, the space
of linear polynomials {a + bx | a, b ‚àà R } is spanned by the set {1, x }. The prior
section also showed that a space can have many sets that span it. Two more
sets that span the space of linear polynomials are { 1, 2x} and {1, x, 2x}.
At the end of that section we described some spanning sets as ‚Äòminimal‚Äô
but we never precisely defined that word. We could mean that a spanning
set is minimal if it contains the smallest number of members of any set with
the same span, so that {1, x, 2x} is not minimal because it has three members
while we can give two-element sets spanning the same space. Or we could mean
that a spanning set is minimal when it has no elements that we can remove
without changing the span. Under this meaning {1, x, 2x} is not minimal because
removing the 2x to get {1, x } leaves the span unchanged.
The first sense of minimality appears to be a global requirement, in that
to check if a spanning set is minimal we seemingly must look at all the sets
that span and find one with the least number of elements. The second sense
of minimality is local since we need to look only at the set and consider the
span with and without various elements. For instance, using the second sense
we could compare the span of {1, x, 2x} with the span of {1, x } and note that 2x
is a ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù in that its removal doesn‚Äôt shrink the span.
In this section we will use the second sense of ‚Äòminimal spanning set‚Äô because
of this technical convenience. However, the most important result of this book
is that the two senses coincide. We will prove that in the next section.

II.1

Definition and Examples

We saw ‚Äúrepeats‚Äù in the first chapter. There, Gauss‚Äôs Method turned them into
0 = 0 equations.
1.1 Example Recall the Statics example from Chapter One‚Äôs opening. We got
two balances with the pair of unknown-mass objects, one at 40 cm and 15 cm
and another at ‚àí50 cm and 25 cm, and we then computed the value of those
masses. Had we instead gotten the second balance at 20 cm and 7.5 cm then
Gauss‚Äôs Method on the resulting two-equations, two-unknowns system would
not have yielded a solution, it would have yielded a 0 = 0 equation along with
an equation containing a free variable. Intuitively, the problem is that (20 7.5)
is half of (40 15), that is, (20 7.5) is in the span of the set {(40 15) } and so is

102

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

repeated data. We would have been trying to solve a two-unknowns problem
with essentially only one piece of information.
We take ~v to be a ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù of the vectors in a set S if ~v ‚àà [S] so that it depends
on, that is, is expressible in terms of, elements of the set ~v = c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn .
1.2 Lemma Where V is a vector space, S is a subset of that space, and ~v is an
element of that space, [S ‚à™ {~v }] = [S] if and only if ~v ‚àà [S].
Proof Half of the if and only if is immediate: if ~v ‚àà
/ [S] then the sets are not

equal because ~v ‚àà [S ‚à™ {~v }].
For the other half assume that ~v ‚àà [S] so that ~v = c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn for some
scalars ci and vectors ~si ‚àà S. We will use mutual containment to show that the
sets [S ‚à™ {~v }] and [S] are equal. The containment [S ‚à™ {~v }] ‚äá [S] is clear.
To show containment in the other direction let w
~ be an element of [S ‚à™ {~v }].
Then w
~ is a linear combination of elements of S ‚à™ {~v }, which we can write as
w
~ = cn+1~sn+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn+k~sn+k + cn+k+1~v. (Possibly some of the ~si ‚Äôs from
w
~ ‚Äôs equation are the same as some of those from ~v‚Äôs equation but that does not
matter.) Expand ~v.
w
~ = cn+1~sn+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn+k~sn+k + cn+k+1 ¬∑ (c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn )
Recognize the right hand side as a linear combination of linear combinations of
vectors from S. Thus w
~ ‚àà [S].
QED
The discussion at the section‚Äôs opening involved removing vectors instead of
adding them.
1.3 Corollary For ~v ‚àà S, omitting that vector does not shrink the span [S] =
[S ‚àí {~v }] if and only if it is dependent on other vectors in the set ~v ‚àà [S].
The corollary says that to know whether removing a vector will decrease the
span, we need to know whether the vector is a linear combination of others in
the set.
1.4 Definition In any vector space, a set of vectors is linearly independent if none
of its elements is a linear combination of the others from the set.‚àó Otherwise
the set is linearly dependent .
Thus the set {~s0 , . . . ,~sn } is independent if there is no equality ~si = c0~s0 +
. . . + ci‚àí1~si‚àí1 + ci+1~si+1 + . . . + cn~sn . The definition‚Äôs use of the word ‚Äòothers‚Äô
means that writing ~si as a linear combination via ~si = 1 ¬∑ ~si does not count.
‚àó See

also Remark 1.12.

103

Section II. Linear Independence

Observe that, although this way of writing one vector as a combination of
the others
~s0 = c1~s1 + c2~s2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn
visually sets off ~s0 , algebraically there is nothing special about that vector in
that equation. For any ~si with a coefficient ci that is non-0 we can rewrite to
isolate ~si .
~si = (1/ci )~s0 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (‚àíci‚àí1 /ci )~si‚àí1 + (‚àíci+1 /ci )~si+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (‚àícn /ci )~sn
When we don‚Äôt want to single out any vector we will instead say that ~s0 ,~s1 , . . . ,~sn
are in a linear relationship and put all of the vectors on the same side. The
next result rephrases the linear independence definition in this style. It is how
we usually compute whether a finite set is dependent or independent.
1.5 Lemma A subset S of a vector space is linearly independent if and only if
among its elements the only linear relationship c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn = ~0 (with
~si 6= ~sj for all i 6= j) is the trivial one c1 = 0, . . . , cn = 0.
Proof If S is linearly independent then no vector ~si is a linear combination

of other vectors from S so there is no linear relationship where some of the ~s ‚Äôs
have nonzero coefficients.
If S is not linearly independent then some ~si is a linear combination ~si =
c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ci‚àí1~si‚àí1 + ci+1~si+1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn of other vectors from S. Subtracting
~si from both sides gives a relationship involving a nonzero coefficient, the ‚àí1 in
front of ~si .
QED
1.6 Example In the vector space of two-wide row vectors, the two-element set
{(40 15), (‚àí50 25) } is linearly independent. To check this, take
c1 ¬∑ (40 15) + c2 ¬∑ (‚àí50 25) = (0 0)
and solve the resulting system.
40c1 ‚àí 50c2 = 0
15c1 + 25c2 = 0

‚àí(15/40)œÅ1 +œÅ2

‚àí‚Üí

40c1 ‚àí

50c2 = 0
(175/4)c2 = 0

Both c1 and c2 are zero. So the only linear relationship between the two given
row vectors is the trivial relationship.
In the same vector space, the set { (40 15), (20 7.5) } is linearly dependent
since we can satisfy c1 ¬∑ (40 15) + c2 ¬∑ (20 7.5) = (0 0) with c1 = 1 and c2 = ‚àí2.
1.7 Example The set {1 + x, 1 ‚àí x} is linearly independent in P2 , the space of
quadratic polynomials with real coefficients, because
0 + 0x + 0x2 = c1 (1 + x) + c2 (1 ‚àí x) = (c1 + c2 ) + (c1 ‚àí c2 )x + 0x2

104

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

gives
c1 + c2 = 0
c1 ‚àí c2 = 0

c1 + c2 = 0
2c2 = 0

‚àíœÅ1 +œÅ2

‚àí‚Üí

since polynomials are equal only if their coefficients are equal. Thus, the only
linear relationship between these two members of P2 is the trivial one.
1.8 Example The rows of this matrix

form a linearly independent set. This is easy to check for this case but also recall
that Lemma One.III.2.5 shows that the rows of any echelon form matrix form a
linearly independent set.

the set S = {~v1 ,~v2 ,~v3 } is linearly dependent because this is a relationship
0 ¬∑ ~v1 + 2 ¬∑ ~v2 ‚àí 1 ¬∑ ~v3 = ~0
where not all of the scalars are zero (the fact that some of the scalars are zero
doesn‚Äôt matter).
That example illustrates why, although Definition 1.4 is a clearer statement
of what independence means, Lemma 1.5 is better for computations. Working
straight from the definition, someone trying to compute whether S is linearly
independent would start by setting ~v1 = c2~v2 + c3~v3 and concluding that there
are no such c2 and c3 . But knowing that the first vector is not dependent on the
other two is not enough. This person would have to go on to try ~v2 = c1~v1 +c3~v3 ,
in order to find the dependence c1 = 0, c3 = 1/2. Lemma 1.5 gets the same
conclusion with only one computation.
1.10 Example The empty subset of a vector space is linearly independent. There
is no nontrivial linear relationship among its members as it has no members.
1.11 Example In any vector space, any subset containing the zero vector is linearly
dependent. One example is, in the space P2 of quadratic polynomials, the subset
{ 1 + x, x + x2 , 0 }. It is linearly dependent because 0 ¬∑ ~v1 + 0 ¬∑ ~v2 + 1 ¬∑ ~0 = ~0 is a
nontrivial relationship, since not all of the coefficients are zero.
A subtler way to see that this subset is dependent is to remember that the
zero vector is equal to the trivial sum, the sum of the empty set. So any set

Section II. Linear Independence

105

containing the zero vector has an element that is a combination of a subset of
other vectors from the set, specifically, the zero vector is a combination of the
empty subset.
1.12 Remark Definition 1.4 describes when a collection of vectors is linearly independent. In this book we will follow the practice of referring to an independent
‚Äòset‚Äô, because sets are the most familiar collections and because that practice is
universal. But to be complete we will note that sets will not do.
Recall that a set is a collection with two properties: order does not matter,
so that the set {1, 2 } equals the set {2, 1 }, and repeats collapse, so that the set
{1, 1, 2 } equals the set {1, 2 }.
Now consider this matrix reduction.

On the left the set of matrix rows {(1 1 1), (2 2 2), (1 2 3) } is linearly dependent. On the right the set {(1 1 1), (1 1 1), (1 2 3) }, which equals the set
{(1 1 1), (1 2 3) }, is linearly independent. That‚Äôs not what we want; we want
to say that the collection of the rows of the second matrix is also dependent.
Thus, for a proper definition of dependence and independence, we need a
type of collection where for the second matrix the row (1 1 1) appears twice.
A collection where order does not matter and where repeats do not collapse is
a multiset. So, strictly speaking, we should in the definition replace ‚Äòset‚Äô with
‚Äòmultiset‚Äô, and adjust all later discussions also.
However, most of the time the distinction won‚Äôt matter and departing from
standard terminology has its own pitfalls, so we will follow the practice of
referring to a linearly independent or dependent ‚Äòset.‚Äô Later in this book we shall
occasionally need to take combinations without letting repeated parts collapse,
and we shall do that without comment.
1.13 Corollary A set S is linearly independent if and only if for any ~v ‚àà S, its
removal shrinks the span [S ‚àí {v }] ( [S].
Proof This follows from Corollary 1.3. If S is linearly independent then none

of its vectors is dependent on the other elements, so removal of any vector will
shrink the span. If S is not linearly independent then it contains a vector that
is dependent on other elements of the set, and removal of that vector will not
shrink the span.
QED
So a spanning set is minimal if and only if it is linearly independent.

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

The prior result addresses removing elements from a linearly independent
set. The next one adds elements.
1.14 Lemma Suppose that S is linearly independent and that ~v ‚àà
/ S. Then the
set S ‚à™ {~v } is linearly independent if and only if ~v ‚àà
/ [S].
Proof We will show that S ‚à™ {~v } is not linearly independent if and only if

~v ‚àà [S].
Suppose first that v ‚àà [S]. Express ~v as a combination ~v = c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn .
Rewrite that ~0 = c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn ‚àí 1 ¬∑ ~v. Since v ‚àà
/ S, it does not equal any of
the ~si so this is a nontrivial linear dependence among the elements of S ‚à™ {~v }.
Thus that set is not linearly independent.
Now suppose that S‚à™{~v } is not linearly independent and consider a nontrivial
dependence among its members ~0 = c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn + cn+1 ¬∑ ~v. If cn+1 = 0
then that is a dependence among the elements of S, but we are assuming that S
is independent, so cn+1 6= 0. Rewrite the equation as ~v = (c1 /cn+1 )~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ +
(cn /cn+1 )~sn to get ~v ‚àà [S]

But there is no linearly independent superset of S. One way to see that is to
note that for any vector that we would add to S, the equation

has a solution c1 = x, c2 = y, and c3 = z. Another way to see it is that we
cannot add any vectors from outside of the span [S] because that span is R3 .
1.16 Corollary In a vector space, any finite set has a linearly independent subset
with the same span.
Proof If S = {~s1 , . . . ,~sn } is linearly independent then S itself satisfies the

statement, so assume that it is linearly dependent.
By the definition of dependent, S contains a vector ~v1 that is a linear
combination of the others. Define the set S1 = S ‚àí {~v1 }. By Corollary 1.3 the
span does not shrink [S1 ] = [S].
If S1 is linearly independent then we are done. Otherwise iterate: take a
vector ~v2 that is a linear combination of other members of S1 and discard it
to derive S2 = S1 ‚àí {~v2 } such that [S2 ] = [S1 ]. Repeat this until a linearly
independent set Sj appears; one must appear eventually because S is finite and
the empty set is linearly independent. (Formally, this argument uses induction
on the number of elements in S. Exercise 41 asks for the details.)
QED
Thus if we have a set that is linearly dependent then we can, without changing
the span, pare down by discarding what we have called ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù vectors.

Section II. Linear Independence

1.18 Corollary A subset S = {~s1 , . . . ,~sn } of a vector space is linearly dependent
if and only if some s~i is a linear combination of the vectors ~s1 , . . . , ~si‚àí1 listed
before it.
Proof Consider S0 = { }, S1 = { s~1 }, S2 = {~s1 ,~s2 }, etc. Some index i > 1 is the

first one with Si‚àí1 ‚à™ {~si } linearly dependent, and there ~si ‚àà [Si‚àí1 ].

QED

The proof of Corollary 1.16 describes producing a linearly independent set
by shrinking, by taking subsets. And the proof of Corollary 1.18 describes
finding a linearly dependent set by taking supersets. We finish this subsection
by considering how linear independence and dependence interact with the subset
relation between sets.
1.19 Lemma Any subset of a linearly independent set is also linearly independent.
Any superset of a linearly dependent set is also linearly dependent.
Proof Both are clear.

QED

Restated, subset preserves independence and superset preserves dependence.
Those are two of the four possible cases. The third case, whether subset
preserves linear dependence, is covered by Example 1.17, which gives a linearly
dependent set S with one subset that is linearly dependent and another that is
independent. The fourth case, whether superset preserves linear independence,
is covered by Example 1.15, which gives cases where a linearly independent set
has both an independent and a dependent superset. This table summarizes.

S independent
S dependent

SÃÇ ‚äÇ S

SÃÇ may be either

Example 1.15 has something else to say about the interaction between linear
independence and superset. It names a linearly independent set that is maximal
in that it has no supersets that are linearly independent. By Lemma 1.14 a
linearly independent set is maximal if and only if it spans the entire space,
because that is when all the vectors in the space are already in the span. This
nicely complements Lemma 1.13, that a spanning set is minimal if and only if it
is linearly independent.

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

X 1.39 Linear independence and linear dependence are properties of sets. We can thus
naturally ask how the properties of linear independence and dependence act with
respect to the familiar elementary set relations and operations. In this body of this
subsection we have covered the subset and superset relations. We can also consider
the operations of intersection, complementation, and union.
(a) How does linear independence relate to intersection: can an intersection of
linearly independent sets be independent? Must it be?
(b) How does linear independence relate to complementation?
(c) Show that the union of two linearly independent sets can be linearly independent.
(d) Show that the union of two linearly independent sets need not be linearly
independent.
1.40 Continued from prior exercise. What is the interaction between the property
of linear independence and the operation of union?
(a) We might conjecture that the union S‚à™T of linearly independent sets is linearly
independent if and only if their spans have a trivial intersection [S] ‚à© [T ] = {~0 }.
What is wrong with this argument for the ‚Äòif‚Äô direction of that conjecture? ‚ÄúIf
the union S ‚à™ T is linearly independent then the only solution to c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ +
cn~sn + d1~t1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + dm~tm = ~0 is the trivial one c1 = 0, . . . , dm = 0. So any
member of the intersection of the spans must be the zero vector because in
c1~s1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~sn = d1~t1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + dm~tm each scalar is zero.‚Äù
(b) Give an example showing that the conjecture is false.
(c) Find linearly independent sets S and T so that the union of S ‚àí (S ‚à© T ) and
T ‚àí (S ‚à© T ) is linearly independent, but the union S ‚à™ T is not linearly independent.
(d) Characterize when the union of two linearly independent sets is linearly
independent, in terms of the intersection of spans.
1.41 For Corollary 1.16,
(a) fill in the induction for the proof;
(b) give an alternate proof that starts with the empty set and builds a sequence
of linearly independent subsets of the given finite set until one appears with the
same span as the given set.
1.42 With a some calculation we can get formulas to determine whether or not a set
of vectors is linearly independent.

(b) Recall the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series: 1 + x + x2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ =
1/(1 ‚àí x) for all x ‚àà (‚àí1..1). Why does this not express a dependence inside of
the set { g(x) = 1/(1 ‚àí x), f0 (x) = 1, f1 (x) = x, f2 (x) = x2 , . . . } (in the vector space
that we are considering)? (Hint. Review the definition of linear combination.)
(c) Show that the set in the prior item is linearly independent.
This shows that some vector spaces exist with linearly independent subsets that
are infinite.
1.45 Show that, where S is a subspace of V, if a subset T of S is linearly independent
in S then T is also linearly independent in V. Is that ‚Äòonly if‚Äô ?

III

Basis and Dimension

The prior section ends with the observation that a spanning set is minimal when
it is linearly independent and a linearly independent set is maximal when it spans
the space. So the notions of minimal spanning set and maximal independent set
coincide. In this section we will name this idea and study its properties.

III.1

Basis

1.1 Definition A basis for a vector space is a sequence of vectors that is linearly
independent and that spans the space.
Because a basis is a sequence, meaning that bases are different if they contain
the same elements but in different orders, we denote it with angle brackets
~ 1, Œ≤
~ 2 , . . .i.‚àó (A sequence is linearly independent if the multiset consisting of
hŒ≤
the elements of the sequence is independent. Similarly, a sequence spans the
space if the set of elements of the sequence spans the space.)

is the standard (or natural) basis. We denote these vectors ~e1 , . . . , ~en .
Calculus books denote R2 ‚Äôs standard basis vectors as ~ƒ± and ~Ôöæ instead of ~e1 and
~e2 and they denote to R3 ‚Äôs standard basis vectors as ~ƒ±, ~Ôöæ, and ~k instead of ~e1 ,
~e2 , and ~e3 . Note that ~e1 means something different in a discussion of R3 than
it means in a discussion of R2 .
1.6 Example Consider the space { a ¬∑ cos Œ∏ + b ¬∑ sin Œ∏ | a, b ‚àà R} of functions of the
real variable Œ∏. This is a natural basis hcos Œ∏, sin Œ∏i = h1¬∑cos Œ∏+0¬∑sin Œ∏, 0¬∑cos Œ∏+
1 ¬∑ sin Œ∏i. A more generic basis for this space is hcos Œ∏ ‚àí sin Œ∏, 2 cos Œ∏ + 3 sin Œ∏i.
Verification that these two are bases is Exercise 27.
1.7 Example A natural basis for the vector space of cubic polynomials P3 is
h1, x, x2 , x3 i. Two other bases for this space are hx3 , 3x2 , 6x, 6i and h1, 1 + x, 1 +
x + x2 , 1 + x + x2 + x3 i. Checking that each is linearly independent and spans
the space is easy.
1.8 Example The trivial space {~0 } has only one basis, the empty one hi.
1.9 Example The space of finite-degree polynomials has a basis with infinitely
many elements h1, x, x2 , . . .i.

solution set of homogeneous systems such as this one

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

Thus the vector space of solutions is the span of a two-element set. This twovector set is also linearly independent, which is easy to check. Therefore the
solution set is a subspace of R4 with a basis comprised of these two vectors.

solution sets of homogeneous systems. To find a basis for this subspace of M2√ó2

The above work shows that it spans the space. Linear independence is also easy.
Consider again Example 1.2. To verify that the set spans the space we looked

~ 1 + c2 Œ≤
~2 = x .
at linear combinations that total to a member of the space c1 Œ≤
y
We only noted in that example that such a combination exists, that for each x, y
there exists a c1 , c2 , but in fact the calculation also shows that the combination
is unique: c1 must be (y ‚àí x)/2 and c2 must be 2x ‚àí y.
1.12 Theorem In any vector space, a subset is a basis if and only if each vector
in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of elements of the subset
in one and only one way.
We consider linear combinations to be the same if they have the same summands
but in a different order, or if they differ only in the addition or deletion of terms
~
of the form ‚Äò0 ¬∑ Œ≤‚Äô.
Proof A sequence is a basis if and only if its vectors form a set that spans and

that is linearly independent. A subset is a spanning set if and only if each vector
in the space is a linear combination of elements of that subset in at least one
way. Thus we need only show that a spanning subset is linearly independent if
and only if every vector in the space is a linear combination of elements from
the subset in at most one way.
Consider two expressions of a vector as a linear combination of the members
~i
of the subset. Rearrange the two sums, and if necessary add some 0 ¬∑ Œ≤

1.17 Remark This use of column notation and the term ‚Äòcoordinate‚Äô has both a
disadvantage and an advantage. The disadvantage is that representations look
like vectors from Rn , which can be confusing when the vector space is Rn , as in
the prior example. We must infer the intent from the context. For example, the

phrase ‚Äòin R2 , where ~v = 32 ‚Äô refers to the plane vector that, when in canonical
position, ends at (3, 2). And in the end of that example, although we‚Äôve omitted
a subscript B from the column, that the right side is a representation is clear
from the context.
The advantage of the notation and the term is that they generalize the
familiar case: in Rn and with respect to the standard basis En , the vector
starting at the origin and ending at (v1 , . . . , vn ) has this representation.

Our main use of representations will come later but the definition appears
here because the fact that every vector is a linear combination of basis vectors in
a unique way is a crucial property of bases, and also to help make a point. For
calculation of coordinates among other things, we shall restrict our attention
to spaces with bases having only finitely many elements. That will start in the
next subsection.

The previous subsection defines a basis of a vector space and shows that a space
can have many different bases. So we cannot talk about ‚Äúthe‚Äù basis for a vector
space. True, some vector spaces have bases that strike us as more natural than
others, for instance, R2 ‚Äôs basis E2 or P2 ‚Äôs basis h1, x, x2 i. But for the vector
space { a2 x2 + a1 x + a0 | 2a2 ‚àí a0 = a1 }, no particular basis leaps out at us as
the natural one. We cannot, in general, associate with a space any single basis
that best describes it.
We can however find something about the bases that is uniquely associated
with the space. This subsection shows that any two bases for a space have the
same number of elements. So with each space we can associate a number, the
number of vectors in any of its bases.
Before we start, we first limit our attention to spaces where at least one basis
has only finitely many members.
2.1 Definition A vector space is finite-dimensional if it has a basis with only
finitely many vectors.
One space that is not finite-dimensional is the set of polynomials with real
coefficients Example 1.11; this space is not spanned by any finite subset since
that would contain a polynomial of largest degree but this space has polynomials
of all degrees. Such spaces are interesting and important but we will focus
in a different direction. From now on we will study only finite-dimensional
vector spaces. In the rest of this book we shall take ‚Äòvector space‚Äô to mean
‚Äòfinite-dimensional vector space‚Äô.
2.2 Remark One reason for sticking to finite-dimensional spaces is so that the
representation of a vector with respect to a basis is a finitely-tall vector and we
can easily write it. Another reason is that the statement ‚Äòany infinite-dimensional
vector space has a basis‚Äô is equivalent to a statement called the Axiom of Choice
[Blass 1984] and so covering this would move us far past this book‚Äôs scope. (A
discussion of the Axiom of Choice is in the Frequently Asked Questions list for
sci.math, and another accessible one is [Rucker].)
To prove the main theorem we shall use a technical result, the Exchange
Lemma. We first illustrate it with an example.
2.3 Example Here is a basis for R3 and a vector given as a linear combination of
members of that basis.

nonzero, di = 0. Using this in equation (‚àó) gives that all of the other d‚Äôs are
also zero. Therefore BÃÇ is linearly independent.
We finish by showing that BÃÇ has the same span as B. Half of this argument,

number of elements.
Proof Fix a vector space with at least one finite basis. Choose, from among

~ 1, . . . , Œ≤
~ n i of minimal size. We will show
all of this space‚Äôs bases, one B = hŒ≤
~
~
that any other basis D = hŒ¥1 , Œ¥2 , . . .i also has the same number of members, n.
Because B has minimal size, D has no fewer than n vectors. We will argue that
it cannot have more than n vectors.

Section III. Basis and Dimension

123

The basis B spans the space and ~Œ¥1 is in the space, so ~Œ¥1 is a nontrivial linear
combination of elements of B. By the Exchange Lemma, we can swap ~Œ¥1 for a
vector from B, resulting in a basis B1 , where one element is ~Œ¥1 and all of the
~
n ‚àí 1 other elements are Œ≤‚Äôs.
The prior paragraph forms the basis step for an induction argument. The
inductive step starts with a basis Bk (for 1 6 k < n) containing k members of D
and n ‚àí k members of B. We know that D has at least n members so there is a
~Œ¥k+1 . Represent it as a linear combination of elements of Bk . The key point: in
that representation, at least one of the nonzero scalars must be associated with
~ i or else that representation would be a nontrivial linear relationship among
aŒ≤
~ i to get a new
elements of the linearly independent set D. Exchange ~Œ¥k+1 for Œ≤

basis Bk+1 with one ~Œ¥ more and one Œ≤

Repeat that until no Œ≤‚Äôs
cannot have more than these n vectors because any ~Œ¥n+1 that remains would be
in the span of Bn (since it is a basis) and hence would be a linear combination
of the other ~Œ¥‚Äôs, contradicting that D is linearly independent.
QED
2.6 Definition The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any
of its bases.
2.7 Example Any basis for Rn has n vectors since the standard basis En has n
vectors. Thus, this definition of ‚Äòdimension‚Äô generalizes the most familiar use of
term, that Rn is n-dimensional.
2.8 Example The space Pn of polynomials of degree at most n has dimension
n+1. We can show this by exhibiting any basis ‚Äî h1, x, . . . , xn i comes to mind ‚Äî
and counting its members.
2.9 Example The space of functions { a ¬∑ cos Œ∏ + b ¬∑ sin Œ∏ | a, b ‚àà R} of the real
variable Œ∏ has dimension 2 since this space has the basis hcos Œ∏, sin Œ∏i.
2.10 Example A trivial space is zero-dimensional since its basis is empty.
Again, although we sometimes say ‚Äòfinite-dimensional‚Äô for emphasis, from
now on we take all vector spaces to be finite-dimensional. So in the next result
the word ‚Äòspace‚Äô means ‚Äòfinite-dimensional vector space‚Äô.
2.11 Corollary No linearly independent set can have a size greater than the
dimension of the enclosing space.
Proof The proof of Theorem 2.5 never uses that D spans the space, only that

it is linearly independent.

QED

2.12 Example Recall the diagram from Example I.2.19 showing the subspaces
of R3 . Each subspace is described with a minimal spanning set, a basis. The

124

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

whole space has a basis with three members, the plane subspaces have bases
with two members, the line subspaces have bases with one member, and the
trivial subspace has a basis with zero members.
In that section we could not show that these are R3 ‚Äôs only subspaces. We can
show it now. The prior corollary proves that There are no, say, five-dimensional
subspaces of three-space. Further, by Definition 2.6 the dimension of every
space is a whole number so there are no subspaces of R3 that are somehow
1.5-dimensional, between lines and planes. Thus the list of subspaces that we
gave is exhaustive; the only subspaces of R3 are either three-, two-, one-, or
zero-dimensional.
2.13 Corollary Any linearly independent set can be expanded to make a basis.
Proof If a linearly independent set is not already a basis then it must not span

the space. Adding to the set a vector that is not in the span will preserve linear
independence by Lemma II.1.14. Keep adding until the resulting set does span
the space, which the prior corollary shows will happen after only a finite number
of steps.
QED
2.14 Corollary Any spanning set can be shrunk to a basis.
Proof Call the spanning set S. If S is empty then it is already a basis (the

space must be a trivial space). If S = {~0 } then it can be shrunk to the empty
basis, thereby making it linearly independent, without changing its span.
Otherwise, S contains a vector ~s1 with ~s1 6= ~0 and we can form a basis
B1 = h~s1 i. If [B1 ] = [S] then we are done. If not then there is a ~s2 ‚àà [S] such
that ~s2 6‚àà [B1 ]. Let B2 = h~s1 , s~2 i; by Lemma II.1.14 this is linearly independent
so if [B2 ] = [S] then we are done.
We can repeat this process until the spans are equal, which must happen in
at most finitely many steps.
QED
2.15 Corollary In an n-dimensional space, a set composed of n vectors is linearly
independent if and only if it spans the space.
Proof First we will show that a subset with n vectors is linearly independent if

and only if it is a basis. The ‚Äòif‚Äô is trivially true ‚Äî bases are linearly independent.
‚ÄòOnly if‚Äô holds because a linearly independent set can be expanded to a basis,
but a basis has n elements, so this expansion is actually the set that we began
with.
To finish, we will show that any subset with n vectors spans the space if and
only if it is a basis. Again, ‚Äòif‚Äô is trivial. ‚ÄòOnly if‚Äô holds because any spanning

Section III. Basis and Dimension

125

set can be shrunk to a basis, but a basis has n elements and so this shrunken
set is just the one we started with.
QED
The main result of this subsection, that all of the bases in a finite-dimensional
vector space have the same number of elements, is the single most important
result in this book. As Example 2.12 shows, it describes what vector spaces and
subspaces there can be.
One immediate consequence brings us back to when we considered the two
things that could be meant by the term ‚Äòminimal spanning set‚Äô. At that point we
defined ‚Äòminimal‚Äô as linearly independent but we noted that another reasonable
interpretation of the term is that a spanning set is ‚Äòminimal‚Äô when it has the
fewest number of elements of any set with the same span. Now that we have
shown that all bases have the same number of elements, we know that the two
senses of ‚Äòminimal‚Äô are equivalent.

III.3

Vector Spaces and Linear Systems

We will now reconsider linear systems and Gauss‚Äôs Method, aided by the tools
and terms of this chapter. We will make three points.
For the first, recall the insight from the Chapter One that Gauss‚Äôs Method
works by taking linear combinations of rows ‚Äî if two matrices are related by
row operations A ‚àí‚Üí ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚àí‚Üí B then each row of B is a linear combination of
the rows of A. Therefore, the right setting in which to study row operations in
general, and Gauss‚Äôs Method in particular, is the following vector space.
3.1 Definition The row space of a matrix is the span of the set of its rows. The
row rank is the dimension of this space, the number of linearly independent
rows.
3.2 Example If
A=

2

3
6

!

then Rowspace(A) is this subspace of the space of two-component row vectors.
{c1 ¬∑ (2 3) + c2 ¬∑ (4 6) | c1 , c2 ‚àà R }
The second row vector is linearly dependent on the first and so we can simplify
the above description to {c ¬∑ (2 3) | c ‚àà R}.

(for i 6= j and k 6= 0) then their row spaces are equal. Hence, row-equivalent
matrices have the same row space and therefore the same row rank.
Proof Corollary One.III.2.4 shows that when A ‚àí‚Üí B then each row of B is a

linear combination of the rows of A. That is, in the above terminology, each row
of B is an element of the row space of A. Then Rowspace(B) ‚äÜ Rowspace(A)
follows because a member of the set Rowspace(B) is a linear combination of the
rows of B, so it is a combination of combinations of the rows of A, and by the
Linear Combination Lemma is also a member of Rowspace(A).
For the other set containment, recall Lemma One.III.1.5, that row operations are reversible so A ‚àí‚Üí B if and only if B ‚àí‚Üí A. Then Rowspace(A) ‚äÜ
Rowspace(B) follows as in the previous paragraph.
QED
Of course, Gauss‚Äôs Method performs the row operations systematically, with
the goal of echelon form.
3.4 Lemma The nonzero rows of an echelon form matrix make up a linearly
independent set.
Proof Lemma One.III.2.5 says that no nonzero row of an echelon form matrix

is a linear combination of the other rows. This result restates that using this
chapter‚Äôs terminology.
QED
Thus, in the language of this chapter, Gaussian reduction works by eliminating
linear dependences among rows, leaving the span unchanged, until no nontrivial
linear relationships remain among the nonzero rows. In short, Gauss‚Äôs Method
produces a basis for the row space.
3.5 Example From any matrix, we can produce a basis for the row space by
performing Gauss‚Äôs Method and taking the nonzero rows of the resulting echelon
form matrix. For instance,

produces the basis h(1 3 1), (0 1 0), (0 0 3)i for the row space. This is a basis
for the row space of both the starting and ending matrices, since the two row
spaces are equal.

129

Section III. Basis and Dimension

Using this technique, we can also find bases for spans not directly involving
row vectors.
3.6 Definition The column space of a matrix is the span of the set of its columns.
The column rank is the dimension of the column space, the number of linearly
independent columns.
Our interest in column spaces stems from our study of linear systems. An
example is that this system
c1 + 3c2 + 7c3 = d1
2c1 + 3c2 + 8c3 = d2
c2 + 2c3 = d3
4c1
+ 4c3 = d4
has a solution if and only if the vector of d‚Äôs is a linear combination of the other
column vectors,

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

3.8 Definition The transpose of a matrix is the result of interchanging its rows
and columns, so that column j of the matrix A is row j of AT and vice versa.
So we can summarize the prior example as ‚Äútranspose, reduce, and transpose
back.‚Äù
We can even, at the price of tolerating the as-yet-vague idea of vector spaces
being ‚Äúthe same,‚Äù use Gauss‚Äôs Method to find bases for spans in other types of
vector spaces.
3.9 Example To get a basis for the span of { x2 + x4 , 2x2 + 3x4 , ‚àíx2 ‚àí 3x4 } in
the space P4 , think of these three polynomials as ‚Äúthe same‚Äù as the row vectors
(0 0 1 0 1), (0 0 2 0 3), and (0 0 ‚àí1 0 ‚àí3), apply Gauss‚Äôs Method

and translate back to get the basis hx2 + x4 , x4 i. (As mentioned earlier, we will
make the phrase ‚Äúthe same‚Äù precise at the start of the next chapter.)
Thus, the first point for this subsection is that the tools of this chapter give
us a more conceptual understanding of Gaussian reduction.
For the second point observe that row operations on a matrix can change its
column space.

The column space of the left-hand matrix contains vectors with a second component that is nonzero but the column space of the right-hand matrix contains
only vectors whose second component is zero, so the two spaces are different.
This observation makes next result surprising.
3.10 Lemma Row operations do not change the column rank.
Proof Restated, if A reduces to B then the column rank of B equals the column

rank of A.
This proof will be finished if we show that row operations do not affect linear
relationships among columns, because the column rank is the size of the largest
set of unrelated columns. That is, we will show that a relationship exists among
columns (such as that the fifth column is twice the second plus the fourth) if and
only if that relationship exists after the row operation. But this is exactly the

Another way to make the point that Gauss‚Äôs Method has something to say
about the column space as well as about the row space is with Gauss-Jordan
reduction. It ends with the reduced echelon form of a matrix, as here.

Consider the row space and the column space of this result.
The first point made earlier in this subsection says that to get a basis for the
row space we can just collect the rows with leading entries. However, because
this is in reduced echelon form, a basis for the column space is just as easy: collect
the columns containing the leading entries, h~e1 , ~e2 i. Thus, for a reduced echelon
form matrix we can find bases for the row and column spaces in essentially the
same way, by taking the parts of the matrix, the rows or columns, containing
the leading entries.
3.11 Theorem For any matrix, the row rank and column rank are equal.
Proof Bring the matrix to reduced echelon form. Then the row rank equals

the number of leading entries since that equals the number of nonzero rows.
Then also, the number of leading entries equals the column rank because the
set of columns containing leading entries consists of some of the ~ei ‚Äôs from a
standard basis, and that set is linearly independent and spans the set of columns.
Hence, in the reduced echelon form matrix, the row rank equals the column
rank, because each equals the number of leading entries.
But Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.10 show that the row rank and column rank
are not changed by using row operations to get to reduced echelon form. Thus
the row rank and the column rank of the original matrix are also equal. QED
3.12 Definition The rank of a matrix is its row rank or column rank.
So the second point that we have made in this subsection is that the column
space and row space of a matrix have the same dimension.

132

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

Our final point is that the concepts that we‚Äôve seen arising naturally in the
study of vector spaces are exactly the ones that we have studied with linear
systems.
3.13 Theorem For linear systems with n unknowns and with matrix of coefficients
A, the statements
(1) the rank of A is r
(2) the vector space of solutions of the associated homogeneous system has
dimension n ‚àí r
are equivalent.
So if the system has at least one particular solution then for the set of solutions,
the number of parameters equals n ‚àí r, the number of variables minus the rank
of the matrix of coefficients.
Proof The rank of A is r if and only if Gaussian reduction on A ends with r

nonzero rows. That‚Äôs true if and only if echelon form matrices row equivalent
to A have r-many leading variables. That in turn holds if and only if there are
n ‚àí r free variables.
QED
3.14 Corollary Where the matrix A is n√ón, these statements
(1) the rank of A is n
(2) A is nonsingular
(3) the rows of A form a linearly independent set
(4) the columns of A form a linearly independent set
(5) any linear system whose matrix of coefficients is A has one and only one
solution
are equivalent.
Proof Clearly (1) ‚áê‚áí (2) ‚áê‚áí (3) ‚áê‚áí (4). The last, (4) ‚áê‚áí (5), holds

because a set of n column vectors is linearly independent if and only if it is a
basis for Rn , but the system

remembered to say that the general solution of an m equations, n unknowns

number; rather, what matters is the number of independent equations, the number of equations in a maximal independent set. Where there are r independent
equations, the general solution involves n ‚àí r parameters.

Combining Subspaces

This subsection is optional. It is required only for the last sections of
Chapter Three and Chapter Five and for occasional exercises. You can
pass it over without loss of continuity.
One way to understand something is to see how to build it from component
parts. For instance, we sometimes think of R3 put together from the x-axis,
the y-axis, and z-axis. In this subsection we will describe how to decompose a
vector space into a combination of some of its subspaces. In developing this idea
of subspace combination, we will keep the R3 example in mind as a prototype.
Subspaces are subsets and sets combine via union. But taking the combination
operation for subspaces to be the simple set union operation isn‚Äôt what we want.
For instance, the union of the x-axis, the y-axis, and z-axis is not all of R3 . In
fact this union is not a subspace because it is not closed under addition: this

is in none of the three axes and hence is not in the union. Therefore to combine
subspaces, in addition to the members of those subspaces, we must at least also
include all of their linear combinations.
4.1 Definition Where W1 , . . . , Wk are subspaces of a vector space, their sum is
the span of their union W1 + W2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + Wk = [W1 ‚à™ W2 ‚à™ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Wk ].
Writing ‚Äò+‚Äô fits with the conventional practice of using this symbol for a natural
accumulation operation.
4.2 Example Our R3 prototype works with this. Any vector w
~ ‚àà R3 is a linear
combination c1~v1 + c2~v2 + c3~v3 where ~v1 is a member of the x-axis, etc., in this
way

and so x-axis + y-axis + z-axis = R3 .
4.3 Example A sum of subspaces can be less than the entire space. Inside of P4 ,
let L be the subspace of linear polynomials {a + bx | a, b ‚àà R } and let C be the
subspace of purely-cubic polynomials { cx3 | c ‚àà R }. Then L + C is not all of P4 .
Instead, L + C = { a + bx + cx3 | a, b, c ‚àà R}.
4.4 Example A space can be described as a combination of subspaces in more
than one way. Besides the decomposition R3 = x-axis + y-axis + z-axis, we can
also write R3 = xy-plane + yz-plane. To check this, note that any w
~ ‚àà R3 can
be written as a linear combination of a member of the xy-plane and a member
of the yz-plane; here are two such combinations.

The above definition gives one way in which we can think of a space as a
combination of some of its parts. However, the prior example shows that there is
at least one interesting property of our benchmark model that is not captured by
the definition of the sum of subspaces. In the familiar decomposition of R3 , we
often speak of a vector‚Äôs ‚Äòx part‚Äô or ‚Äòy part‚Äô or ‚Äòz part‚Äô. That is, in our prototype
each vector has a unique decomposition into pieces from the parts making up
the whole space. But in the decomposition used in Example 4.4, we cannot refer
to the ‚Äúxy part‚Äù of a vector ‚Äî these three sums

all describe the vector as comprised of something from the first plane plus
something from the second plane, but the ‚Äúxy part‚Äù is different in each.
That is, when we consider how R3 is put together from the three axes we
might mean ‚Äúin such a way that every vector has at least one decomposition,‚Äù
which gives the definition above. But if we take it to mean ‚Äúin such a way
that every vector has one and only one decomposition‚Äù then we need another
condition on combinations. To see what this condition is, recall that vectors are
uniquely represented in terms of a basis. We can use this to break a space into a
sum of subspaces such that any vector in the space breaks uniquely into a sum
of members of those subspaces.
4.5 Example Consider R3 with its standard basis E3 = h~e1 , ~e2 , ~e3 i. The subspace
with the basis B1 = h~e1 i is the x-axis, the subspace with the basis B2 = h~e2 i is
the y-axis, and the subspace with the basis B3 = h~e3 i is the z-axis. The fact
that any member of R3 is expressible as a sum of vectors from these subspaces

has a solution for any x, y, z ‚àà R. And the fact that each such expression is
unique reflects that fact that E3 is linearly independent, so any equation like
the one above has a unique solution.
4.6 Example We don‚Äôt have to take the basis vectors one at a time, we can
conglomerate them into larger sequences. Consider again the space R3 and the
vectors from the standard basis E3 . The subspace with the basis B1 = h~e1 , ~e3 i
is the xz-plane. The subspace with the basis B2 = h~e2 i is the y-axis. As in the

4.8 Lemma Let V be a vector space that is the sum of some of its subspaces
V = W1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + Wk . Let B1 , . . . , Bk be bases for these subspaces. The following
are equivalent.
(1) The expression of any ~v ‚àà V as a combination ~v = w
~ 1 + ¬∑¬∑¬∑ + w
~ k with
w
~ i ‚àà Wi is unique.
_
_
(2) The concatenation B1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Bk is a basis for V.
(3) Among nonzero vectors from different Wi ‚Äôs every linear relationship is
trivial.
Proof We will show that (1) =‚áí (2), that (2) =‚áí (3), and finally that
(3) =‚áí (1). For these arguments, observe that we can pass from a combination

(‚àó)

and vice versa (we can move from the bottom to the top by taking each di to
be 1).
For (1) =‚áí (2), assume that all decompositions are unique. We will show
_
_
that B1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Bk spans the space and is linearly independent. It spans the
space because the assumption that V = W1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + Wk means that every ~v
can be expressed as ~v = w
~ 1 + ¬∑¬∑¬∑ + w
~ k , which translates by equation (‚àó) to an
~ from the concatenation. For
expression of ~v as a linear combination of the Œ≤‚Äôs
linear independence, consider this linear relationship.
~0 = c1,1 Œ≤
~ 1,1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck,nk Œ≤
~ k,nk
Regroup as in (‚àó) (that is, move from bottom to top) to get the decomposition
~0 = w
~ 1 + ¬∑¬∑¬∑ + w
~ k . Because the zero vector obviously has the decomposition
~0 = ~0 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ~0, the assumption that decompositions are unique shows that each
~ i,1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ci,ni Œ≤
~ i,ni = ~0, and since
w
~ i is the zero vector. This means that ci,1 Œ≤
each Bi is a basis we have the desired conclusion that all of the c‚Äôs are zero.
For (2) =‚áí (3) assume that the concatenation of the bases is a basis for the
entire space. Consider a linear relationship among nonzero vectors from different

139

Section III. Basis and Dimension

Wi ‚Äôs. This might or might not involve a vector from W1 , or one from W2 , etc.,
so we write it ~0 = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + di w
~ i + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ . As in equation (‚àó) expand the vector.
~0 = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + di (ci,1 Œ≤
~ i,1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ci,ni Œ≤
~ i,ni ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑
~ i,1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + di ci,ni ¬∑ Œ≤
~ i,ni + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑
= ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + di ci,1 ¬∑ Œ≤
_

_

The linear independence of B1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Bk gives that each coefficient di ci,j is zero.
Since w
~ i is nonzero vector, at least one of the ci,j ‚Äôs is not zero, and thus di is
zero. This holds for each di , and therefore the linear relationship is trivial.
Finally, for (3) =‚áí (1), assume that among nonzero vectors from different
Wi ‚Äôs any linear relationship is trivial. Consider two decompositions of a vector
~v = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + w
~ i + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ and ~v = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ~uj + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ where w
~ i ‚àà Wi and ~uj ‚àà Wj . Subtract
one from the other to get a linear relationship, something like this (if there is no
~ui or w
~ j then leave those out).
~0 = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (~
wi ‚àí ~ui ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (~
wj ‚àí ~uj ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑
The case assumption that statement (3) holds implies that the terms each equal
the zero vector w
~ i ‚àí ~ui = ~0. Hence decompositions are unique.

4.9 Definition A collection of subspaces { W1 , . . . , Wk } is independent if no
nonzero vector from any Wi is a linear combination of vectors from the other
subspaces W1 , . . . , Wi‚àí1 , Wi+1 , . . . , Wk .
4.10 Definition A vector space V is the direct sum (or internal direct sum)
of its subspaces W1 , . . . , Wk if V = W1 + W2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + Wk and the collection
{W1 , . . . , Wk } is independent. We write V = W1 ‚äï W2 ‚äï ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äï Wk .

It is the direct sum of subspaces in many other ways as well; direct sum
decompositions are not unique.
4.13 Corollary The dimension of a direct sum is the sum of the dimensions of its
summands.
Proof In Lemma 4.8, the number of basis vectors in the concatenation equals

the sum of the number of vectors in the sub-bases.

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces
The special case of two subspaces is worth its own mention.

4.14 Definition When a vector space is the direct sum of two of its subspaces
then they are complements.
4.15 Lemma A vector space V is the direct sum of two of its subspaces W1 and
W2 if and only if it is the sum of the two V = W1 + W2 and their intersection
is trivial W1 ‚à© W2 = {~0 }.
Proof Suppose first that V = W1 ‚äï W2 . By definition, V is the sum of the

two V = W1 + W2 . To show that their intersection is trivial let ~v be a vector
from W1 ‚à© W2 and consider the equation ~v = ~v. On that equation‚Äôs left side is
a member of W1 and on the right is a member of W2 , which we can think of as
a linear combination of members of W2 . But the two spaces are independent so
the only way that a member of W1 can be a linear combination of vectors from
W2 is if that member is the zero vector ~v = ~0.
For the other direction, suppose that V is the sum of two spaces with a
trivial intersection. To show that V is a direct sum of the two we need only
show that the spaces are independent ‚Äî that no nonzero member of the first is
expressible as a linear combination of members of the second, and vice versa.
This holds because any relationship w
~ 1 = c1 w
~ 2,1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck w
~ 2,k (with w
~ 1 ‚àà W1
and w
~ 2,j ‚àà W2 for all j) shows that the vector on the left is also in W2 , since
the right side is a combination of members of W2 . The intersection of these two
spaces is trivial, so w
~ 1 = ~0. The same argument works for any w
~ 2.
QED
4.16 Example In R2 the x-axis and the y-axis are complements, that is, R2 =
x-axis‚äïy-axis. A space can have more than one pair of complementary subspaces;
another pair for R2 are the subspaces consisting of the lines y = x and y = 2x.
4.17 Example In the space F = {a cos Œ∏ + b sin Œ∏ | a, b ‚àà R }, the subspaces W1 =
{a cos Œ∏ | a ‚àà R } and W2 = { b sin Œ∏ | b ‚àà R } are complements. The prior example noted that a space can be decomposed into more than one pair of complements. In addition note that F can has more than one pair of complementary
subspaces where the first in the pair is W1 ‚Äî another complement of W1 is
W3 = { b sin Œ∏ + b cos Œ∏ | b ‚àà R }.
4.18 Example In R3 , the xy-plane and the yz-planes are not complements, which
is the point of the discussion following Example 4.4. One complement of the
xy-plane is the z-axis.
Here is a natural question that arises from Lemma 4.15: for k > 2 is the
simple sum V = W1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + Wk also a direct sum if and only if the intersection
of the subspaces is trivial?

Section III. Basis and Dimension

4.19 Example If there are more than two subspaces then having a trivial intersection is not enough to guarantee unique decomposition (i.e., is not enough to
ensure that the spaces are independent). In R3 , let W1 be the x-axis, let W2 be
the y-axis, and let W3 be this.

definition at the end of the Chapter Five.

4.30 (Refer to Example 4.19. This exercise shows that the requirement that pairwise
intersections be trivial is genuinely stronger than the requirement only that the
intersection of all of the subspaces be trivial.) Give a vector space and three
subspaces W1 , W2 , and W3 such that the space is the sum of the subspaces,
the intersection of all three subspaces W1 ‚à© W2 ‚à© W3 is trivial, but the pairwise

the other half does not extend.)

Fields
Computations involving only integers or only rational numbers are much easier
than those with real numbers. Could other algebraic structures, such as the
integers or the rationals, work in the place of R in the definition of a vector
space?
If we take ‚Äúwork‚Äù to mean that the results of this chapter remain true then
there is a natural list of conditions that a structure (that is, number system)
must have in order to work in the place of R. A field is a set F with operations
‚Äò+‚Äô and ‚Äò¬∑‚Äô such that
(1) for any a, b ‚àà F the result of a + b is in F, and a + b = b + a, and if c ‚àà F
then a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
(2) for any a, b ‚àà F the result of a ¬∑ b is in F, and a ¬∑ b = b ¬∑ a, and if c ‚àà F then
a ¬∑ (b ¬∑ c) = (a ¬∑ b) ¬∑ c
(3) if a, b, c ‚àà F then a ¬∑ (b + c) = a ¬∑ b + a ¬∑ c
(4) there is an element 0 ‚àà F such that if a ‚àà F then a + 0 = a, and for each
a ‚àà F there is an element ‚àía ‚àà F such that (‚àía) + a = 0
(5) there is an element 1 ‚àà F such that if a ‚àà F then a ¬∑ 1 = a, and for each
element a 6= 0 of F there is an element a‚àí1 ‚àà F such that a‚àí1 ¬∑ a = 1.
For example, the algebraic structure consisting of the set of real numbers
along with its usual addition and multiplication operation is a field. Another
field is the set of rational numbers with its usual addition and multiplication
operations. An example of an algebraic structure that is not a field is the integers,
because it fails the final condition.
Some examples are more surprising. The set B = {0, 1 } under these operations:

Topic: Fields

We could in this book develop Linear Algebra as the theory of vector spaces
with scalars from an arbitrary field. In that case, almost all of the statements here
would carry over by replacing ‚ÄòR‚Äô with ‚ÄòF‚Äô, that is, by taking coefficients, vector
entries, and matrix entries to be elements of F (the exceptions are statements
involving distances or angles, which would need additional development). Here
are some examples; each applies to a vector space V over a field F.
‚àó For any ~v ‚àà V and a ‚àà F, (i) 0 ¬∑~v = ~0, (ii) ‚àí1 ¬∑~v +~v = ~0, and (iii) a ¬∑ ~0 = ~0.
‚àó The span, the set of linear combinations, of a subset of V is a subspace of
V.
‚àó Any subset of a linearly independent set is also linearly independent.
‚àó In a finite-dimensional vector space, any two bases have the same number
of elements.
(Even statements that don‚Äôt explicitly mention F use field properties in their
proof.)
We will not develop vector spaces in this more general setting because the
additional abstraction can be a distraction. The ideas we want to bring out
already appear when we stick to the reals.
The exception is Chapter Five. There we must factor polynomials, so we
will switch to considering vector spaces over the field of complex numbers.

Crystals

Everyone has noticed that table salt comes in little cubes.

This orderly outside arises from an orderly inside ‚Äî the way the atoms lie is
also cubical, these cubes stack in neat rows and columns, and the salt faces tend
to be just an outer layer of cubes. One cube of atoms is shown below. Salt is
sodium chloride and the small spheres shown are sodium while the big ones are
chloride. To simplify the view, it only shows the sodiums and chlorides on the
front, top, and right.

The specks of salt that we see above have many repetitions of this fundamental
unit. A solid, such as table salt, with a regular internal structure is a crystal.
We can restrict our attention to the front face. There we have a square
repeated many times giving a lattice of atoms.

The distance along the sides of each square cell is about 3.34 √Öngstroms (an
√Öngstrom is 10‚àí10 meters). When we want to refer to atoms in the lattice that
number is unwieldy, and so we take the square‚Äôs side length as a unit. That is,
we naturally adopt this basis.

Another crystal from everyday experience is pencil lead. It is graphite,
formed from carbon atoms arranged in this shape.

This is a single plane of graphite, called graphene. A piece of graphite consists of
many of these planes, layered. The chemical bonds between the planes are much
weaker than the bonds inside the planes, which explains why pencils write ‚Äî the
graphite can be sheared so that the planes slide off and are left on the paper.
We can get a convenient unit of length by decomposing the hexagonal ring
into three regions that are rotations of this unit cell.

The vectors that form the sides of that unit cell make a convenient basis. The
distance along the bottom and slant is 1.42 √Öngstroms, so this

is a good basis.
Another familiar crystal formed from carbon is diamond. Like table salt it
is built from cubes but the structure inside each cube is more complicated. In
addition to carbons at each corner,

there are carbons in the middle of each face.

(To show the new face carbons clearly, the corner carbons are reduced to dots.)
There are also four more carbons inside the cube, two that are a quarter of the
way up from the bottom and two that are a quarter of the way down from the
top.

(As before, carbons shown earlier are reduced here to dots.) The distance along
any edge of the cube is 2.18 √Öngstroms. Thus, a natural basis for describing the
locations of the carbons and the bonds between them, is this.

The examples here show that the structures of crystals is complicated enough
to need some organized system to give the locations of the atoms and how they
are chemically bound. One tool for that organization is a convenient basis. This
application of bases is simple but it shows a science context where the idea arises
naturally.

Voting Paradoxes
Imagine that a Political Science class studying the American presidential process
holds a mock election. The 29 class members rank the Democratic Party,
Republican Party, and Third Party nominees, from most preferred to least
preferred (> means ‚Äòis preferred to‚Äô).

What is the preference of the group as a whole?
Overall, the group prefers the Democrat to the Republican by five votes;
seventeen voters ranked the Democrat above the Republican versus twelve the
other way. And the group prefers the Republican to the Third‚Äôs nominee, fifteen
to fourteen. But, strangely enough, the group also prefers the Third to the
Democrat, eighteen to eleven.

This is a voting paradox , specifically, a majority cycle.
Mathematicians study voting paradoxes in part because of their implications
for practical politics. For instance, the instructor can manipulate this class into

151

Topic: Voting Paradoxes

choosing the Democrat as the overall winner by first asking for a vote between
the Republican and the Third, and then asking for a vote between the winner
of that contest, who will be the Republican, and the Democrat. By similar
manipulations the instructor can make any of the other two candidates come out
as the winner. (We will stick to three-candidate elections but the same thing
happens in larger elections.)
Mathematicians also study voting paradoxes simply because they are interesting. One interesting aspect is that the group‚Äôs overall majority cycle occurs
despite that each single voter‚Äôs preference list is rational, in a straight-line order.
That is, the majority cycle seems to arise in the aggregate without being present
in the components of that aggregate, the preference lists. However we can use
linear algebra to argue that a tendency toward cyclic preference is actually
present in each voter‚Äôs list and that it surfaces when there is more adding of the
tendency than canceling.
For this, abbreviating the choices as D, R, and T , we can describe how a
voter with preference order D > R > T contributes to the above cycle.
D
‚àí1 voter

1 voter

T

R
1 voter

(The negative sign is here because the arrow describes T as preferred to D, but
this voter likes them the other way.) The descriptions for the other preference
lists are in the table on page 153.
Now, to conduct the election we linearly combine these descriptions; for
instance, the Political Science mock election

yields the circular group preference shown earlier.
Of course, taking linear combinations is linear algebra. The graphical cycle
notation is suggestive but inconvenient so we use column vectors by starting at
the D and taking the numbers from the cycle in counterclockwise order. Thus,
we represent the mock election and a single D > R > T vote in this way.

We say that the first voter has positive spin since the cycle part is with the
direction that we have chosen for the arrows, while the second voter‚Äôs spin is
negative.
The fact that these opposite voters cancel each other is reflected in the fact
that their vote vectors add to zero. This suggests an alternate way to tally an
election. We could first cancel as many opposite preference lists as possible and
then determine the outcome by adding the remaining lists.

If we conduct the election as just described then after the cancellation of as many
opposite pairs of voters as possible there will remain three sets of preference
lists: one set from the first row, one from the second row, and one from the third
row. We will finish by proving that a voting paradox can happen only if the
spins of these three sets are in the same direction. That is, for a voting paradox
to occur the three remaining sets must all come from the left of the table or all
come from the right (see Exercise 3). This shows that there is some connection

T

154

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

between the majority cycle and the decomposition that we are using ‚Äî a voting
paradox can happen only when the tendencies toward cyclic preference reinforce
each other.
For the proof, assume that we have canceled opposite preference orders and
are left with one set of preference lists for each of the three rows. Consider the
first row‚Äôs remaining preference lists. They could be from the first row‚Äôs left or
right (or between, since the lists could have canceled exactly). We shall write
D
a

‚àía

T

R
a

where a is an integer that is positive if the remaining lists are on the left, where
a is negative if the lists are on the right, and zero if the cancellation was perfect.
Similarly we have integers b and c for the second and third rows, which can
each be positive, negative, or zero.
Then the election is determined by this sum.

A voting paradox occurs when the three numbers in the total cycle on the right,
‚àía + b + c and a ‚àí b + c and a + b ‚àí c, are all nonnegative or all nonpositive. We
will prove this occurs only when either all three of a, b, and c are nonnegative
or all three are nonpositive.
Let the total cycle numbers be nonnegative; the other case is similar.
‚àía + b + c > 0
a‚àíb+c>0
a+b‚àíc>0
Add the first two rows to see that c > 0. Add the first and third rows for b > 0.
And, the second and third rows together give a > 0. Thus if the total cycle is
nonnegative then in each row the remaining preference lists are from the table‚Äôs
left. That ends the proof.
This result says only that having all three spin in the same direction is a
necessary condition for a majority cycle. It is not sufficient; see Exercise 4.
Voting theory and associated topics are the subject of current research. There
are many intriguing results, notably those produced by K Arrow [Arrow] who
won the Nobel Prize in part for this work, showing that no voting system is
entirely fair (for a reasonable definition of ‚Äúfair‚Äù). Some good introductory articles are [Gardner, 1970], [Gardner, 1974], [Gardner, 1980], and [Neimi & Riker].
[Taylor] is a readable text. The long list of cases from recent American political

Topic: Voting Paradoxes

history in [Poundstone] shows these paradoxes are routinely manipulated in
practice. (On the other hand, quite recent research shows that computing how
to manipulate elections can in general be unfeasible, but this is beyond our
scope.) This Topic is drawn from [Zwicker]. (Author‚Äôs Note: I would like to
thank Professor Zwicker for his kind and illuminating discussions.)
Exercises
1 Here is a reasonable way in which a voter could have a cyclic preference. Suppose
that this voter ranks each candidate on each of three criteria.
(a) Draw up a table with the rows labeled ‚ÄòDemocrat‚Äô, ‚ÄòRepublican‚Äô, and ‚ÄòThird‚Äô,
and the columns labeled ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô, ‚Äòexperience‚Äô, and ‚Äòpolicies‚Äô. Inside each
column, rank some candidate as most preferred, rank another as in the middle,
and rank the remaining one as least preferred.
(b) In this ranking, is the Democrat preferred to the Republican in (at least) two
out of three criteria, or vice versa? Is the Republican preferred to the Third?
(c) Does the table that was just constructed have a cyclic preference order? If
not, make one that does.
So it is possible for a voter to have a cyclic preference among candidates. The
paradox described above, however, is that even if each voter has a straight-line
preference list, a cyclic preference can still arise for the entire group.
2 Compute the values in the table of decompositions.
3 Perform the cancellations of opposite preference orders for the Political Science
class‚Äôs mock election. Are all the remaining preferences from the left three rows of
the table or from the right?
4 The necessary condition that a voting paradox can happen only if all three
preference lists remaining after cancellation have the same spin is not also sufficient.
(a) Give an example of a vote where there is a majority cycle and addition of one
more voter with the same spin causes the cycle to go away.
(b) Can the opposite happen; can addition of one voter with a ‚Äúwrong‚Äù spin cause
a cycle to appear?
(c) Give a condition that is both necessary and sufficient to get a majority cycle.
5 A one-voter election cannot have a majority cycle because of the requirement that
we‚Äôve imposed that the voter‚Äôs list must be rational.
(a) Show that a two-voter election may have a majority cycle. (We consider the
group preference a majority cycle if all three group totals are nonnegative or if
all three are nonpositive‚Äîthat is, we allow some zero‚Äôs in the group preference.)
(b) Show that for any number of voters greater than one, there is an election
involving that many voters that results in a majority cycle.
6 Let U be a subspace of R3 . Prove that the set U‚ä• = {~v | ~v ‚Ä¢ ~u = 0 for all ~u ‚àà U }

this hold if U is not a subspace?

Dimensional Analysis
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt add apples and oranges,‚Äù the old saying goes. It reflects our experience
that in applications the quantities have units and keeping track of those units
can help. Everyone has done calculations such as this one that use the units as
a check.

We can take the idea of including the units beyond bookkeeping. We can use
units to draw conclusions about what relationships are possible among the
physical quantities.
To start, consider the falling body equation distance = 16 ¬∑ (time)2 . If the
distance is in feet and the time is in seconds then this is a true statement.
However it is not correct in other unit systems, such as meters and seconds,
because 16 isn‚Äôt the right constant in those systems. We can fix that by attaching
units to the 16, making it a dimensional constant .
dist = 16

ft
¬∑ (time)2

Now the equation holds also in the meter-second system because when we align
the units (a foot is approximately 0.30 meters),
distance in meters = 16

0.30 m

¬∑ (time in sec)2 = 4.8
¬∑ (time in sec)2

the constant gets adjusted. So in order to have equations that are correct across
unit systems, we restrict our attention to those that use dimensional constants.
Such an equation is complete.
Moving away from a particular unit system allows us to just measure quantities in combinations of some units of length L, mass M, and time T . These
three are our physical dimensions. For instance, we could measure velocity in
feet/second or fathoms/hour but at all events it involves a unit of length divided
by a unit of time so the dimensional formula of velocity is L/T . Similarly,
density‚Äôs dimensional formula is M/L3 .

157

Topic: Dimensional Analysis

To write the dimensional formula we shall use negative exponents instead of
fractions and we shall include the dimensions with a zero exponent. Thus we
will write the dimensional formula of velocity as L1 M0 T ‚àí1 and that of density
as L‚àí3 M1 T 0 .
With that, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt add apples and oranges‚Äù becomes the advice to check
that all of an equation‚Äôs terms have the same dimensional formula. An example
is this version of the falling body equation d ‚àí gt2 = 0. The dimensional formula
of the d term is L1 M0 T 0 . For the other term, the dimensional formula of g
is L1 M0 T ‚àí2 (g is given above as 16 ft/sec2 ) and the dimensional formula of t
is L0 M0 T 1 so that of the entire gt2 term is L1 M0 T ‚àí2 (L0 M0 T 1 )2 = L1 M0 T 0 .
Thus the two terms have the same dimensional formula. An equation with this
property is dimensionally homogeneous.
Quantities with dimensional formula L0 M0 T 0 are dimensionless. For example, we measure an angle by taking the ratio of the subtended arc to the
radius
arc
r

which is the ratio of a length to a length (L1 M0 T 0 )(L1 M0 T 0 )‚àí1 and thus angles
have the dimensional formula L0 M0 T 0 .
The classic example of using the units for more than bookkeeping, using
them to draw conclusions, considers the formula for the period of a pendulum.
p = ‚Äìsome expression involving the length of the string, etc.‚Äì
The period is in units of time L0 M0 T 1 . So the quantities on the other side of
the equation must have dimensional formulas that combine in such a way that
their L‚Äôs and M‚Äôs cancel and only a single T remains. The table on page 158 has
the quantities that an experienced investigator would consider possibly relevant
to the period of a pendulum. The only dimensional formulas involving L are for
the length of the string and the acceleration due to gravity. For the L‚Äôs of these
two to cancel when they appear in the equation they must be in ratio, e.g., as
(`/g)2 , or as cos(`/g), or as (`/g)‚àí1 . Therefore the period is a function of `/g.
This is a remarkable result: with a pencil and paper analysis, before we ever
took out the pendulum and made measurements, we have determined something
about what makes up its period.
To do dimensional analysis systematically, we need two facts (arguments
for these are in [Bridgman], Chapter II and IV). The first is that each equation
relating physical quantities that we shall see involves a sum of terms, where each
term has the form
p2
pk
1
mp
1 m2 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ mk

158

Chapter Two. Vector Spaces

for numbers m1 , . . . , mk that measure the quantities.
For the second fact, observe that an easy way to construct a dimensionally
homogeneous expression is by taking a product of dimensionless quantities
or by adding such dimensionless terms. Buckingham‚Äôs Theorem states that
any complete relationship among quantities with dimensional formulas can be
algebraically manipulated into a form where there is some function f such that
f(Œ†1 , . . . , Œ†n ) = 0
for a complete set {Œ†1 , . . . , Œ†n } of dimensionless products. (The first example
below describes what makes a set of dimensionless products ‚Äòcomplete‚Äô.) We
usually want to express one of the quantities, m1 for instance, in terms of the
others. For that we will assume that the above equality can be rewritten

m1 = m‚àíp

2 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ mk is dimensionless and the products Œ†2 , . . . , Œ†n
don‚Äôt involve m1 (as with f, here fÃÇ is an arbitrary function, this time of n ‚àí 1
arguments). Thus, to do dimensional analysis we should find which dimensionless
products are possible.
For example, again consider the formula for a pendulum‚Äôs period.

By the first fact cited above, we expect the formula to have (possibly sums of
terms of) the form pp1 `p2 mp3 gp4 Œ∏p5 . To use the second fact, to find which
combinations of the powers p1 , . . . , p5 yield dimensionless products, consider
this equation.
(L0 M0 T 1 )p1 (L1 M0 T 0 )p2 (L0 M1 T 0 )p3 (L1 M0 T ‚àí2 )p4 (L0 M0 T 0 )p5 = L0 M0 T 0

The set of dimensionless products contains all terms pp1 `p2 mp3 ap4 Œ∏p5
subject to the conditions above. This set forms a vector space under the ‚Äò+‚Äô
operation of multiplying two such products and the ‚Äò¬∑‚Äô operation of raising such
a product to the power of the scalar (see Exercise 5). The term ‚Äòcomplete set of
dimensionless products‚Äô in Buckingham‚Äôs Theorem means a basis for this vector
space.
We can get a basis by first taking p1 = 1, p5 = 0, and then taking p1 = 0,
p5 = 1. The associated dimensionless products are Œ†1 = p`‚àí1/2 g1/2 and Œ†2 = Œ∏.
Because the set { Œ†1 , Œ†2 } is complete, Buckingham‚Äôs Theorem says that
p
p = `1/2 g‚àí1/2 ¬∑ fÃÇ(Œ∏) = `/g ¬∑ fÃÇ(Œ∏)
where fÃÇ is a function that we cannot determine from this analysis (a first year
physics text will show by other means that for small angles it is approximately
the constant function fÃÇ(Œ∏) = 2œÄ).
Thus, analysis of the relationships that are possible between the quantities
with the given dimensional formulas has given us a fair amount of information: a
pendulum‚Äôs period does not depend on the mass of the bob, and it rises with
the square root of the length of the string.
For the next example we try to determine the period of revolution of two
bodies in space orbiting each other under mutual gravitational attraction. An
experienced investigator could expect that these are the relevant quantities.

As earlier, the set of dimensionless products of these quantities forms a
vector space and we want to produce a basis for that space, a ‚Äòcomplete‚Äô set of
dimensionless products. One such set, gotten from setting p1 = 1 and p4 = 0

Remark. An important application of the prior formula is when m1 is the
mass of the sun and m2 is the mass of a planet. Because m1 is very much greater
than m2 , the argument to fÃÇ is approximately 0, and we can wonder whether
this part of the formula remains approximately constant as m2 varies. One way
to see that it does is this. The sun is so much larger than the planet that the
mutual rotation is approximately about the sun‚Äôs center. If we vary the planet‚Äôs
mass m2 by a factor of x (e.g., Venus‚Äôs mass is x = 0.815 times Earth‚Äôs mass),
then the force of attraction is multiplied by x, and x times the force acting on
x times the mass gives, since F = ma, the same acceleration, about the same
center (approximately). Hence, the orbit will be the same and so its period
will be the same, and thus the right side of the above equation also remains
unchanged (approximately). Therefore, fÃÇ(m2 /m1 ) is approximately constant as
m2 varies. This is Kepler‚Äôs Third Law: the square of the period of a planet is
proportional to the cube of the mean radius of its orbit about the sun.
The final example was one of the first explicit applications of dimensional
analysis. Lord Raleigh considered the speed of a wave in deep water and
suggested these as the relevant quantities.

Maps Between Spaces

Isomorphisms

In the examples following the definition of a vector space we expressed the
intuition that some spaces are ‚Äúthe same‚Äù as others. For instance, the space of
two-tall column vectors and the space of two-wide row vectors are not equal
because their elements ‚Äî column vectors and row vectors ‚Äî are not equal, but
we feel that these spaces differ only in how their elements appear. We will now
make this precise.
This section illustrates a common phase of a mathematical investigation.
With the help of some examples we‚Äôve gotten an idea. We will next give a formal
definition and then we will produce some results backing our contention that
the definition captures the idea. We‚Äôve seen this happen already, for instance in
the first section of the Vector Space chapter. There, the study of linear systems
led us to consider collections closed under linear combinations. We defined such
a collection as a vector space and we followed it with some supporting results.
That wasn‚Äôt an end point, instead it led to new insights such as the idea of a
basis. Here also, after producing a definition and supporting it, we will get two
surprises (pleasant ones). First, we will find that the definition applies to some
unforeseen, and interesting, cases. Second, the study of the definition will lead
to new ideas. In this way, our investigation will build momentum.

1.3 Definition An isomorphism between two vector spaces V and W is a map
f : V ‚Üí W that
(1) is a correspondence: f is one-to-one and onto;‚àó
(2) preserves structure: if ~v1 ,~v2 ‚àà V then
f(~v1 + ~v2 ) = f(~v1 ) + f(~v2 )
and if ~v ‚àà V and r ‚àà R then
f(r~v) = rf(~v)

We will check this by going through the conditions in the definition. We will
first verify condition (1), that the map is a correspondence between the sets
underlying the spaces.
To establish that f is one-to-one we must prove that f(~
a) = f(~b) only when
~
a
~ = b. If
f(a1 cos Œ∏ + a2 sin Œ∏) = f(b1 cos Œ∏ + b2 sin Œ∏)

from which we conclude that a1 = b1 and a2 = b2 , because column vectors
are equal only when they have equal components. Thus a1 cos Œ∏ + a2 sin Œ∏ =
b1 cos Œ∏ + b2 sin Œ∏, and as required we‚Äôve verified that f(~
a) = f(~b) implies that

Section I. Isomorphisms

The first map is the more natural correspondence in that it just carries the
coefficients over. However we shall do f2 to underline that there are isomorphisms
other than the obvious one. (Checking that f1 is an isomorphism is Exercise 14.)
To show that f2 is one-to-one we will prove that if f2 (c1 x + c2 y + c3 z) =
f2 (d1 x + d2 y + d3 z) then c1 x + c2 y + c3 z = d1 x + d2 y + d3 z. The assumption
that f2 (c1 x + c2 y + c3 z) = f2 (d1 x + d2 y + d3 z) gives, by the definition of f2 , that
c2 + c3 x + c1 x2 = d2 + d3 x + d1 x2 . Equal polynomials have equal coefficients so
c2 = d2 , c3 = d3 , and c1 = d1 . Hence f2 (c1 x+c2 y+c3 z) = f2 (d1 x+d2 y+d3 z)
implies that c1 x + c2 y + c3 z = d1 x + d2 y + d3 z, and f2 is one-to-one.
The map f2 is onto because a member a + bx + cx2 of the codomain is the
image of a member of the domain, namely it is f2 (cx + ay + bz). For instance,
2 + 3x ‚àí 4x2 is f2 (‚àí4x + 2y + 3z).
The computations for structure preservation are like those in the prior
example. The map f2 preserves addition
f2 (c1 x + c2 y + c3 z) + (d1 x + d2 y + d3 z)



= f2 (c1 + d1 )x + (c2 + d2 )y + (c3 + d3 )z



= (c2 + d2 ) + (c3 + d3 )x + (c1 + d1 )x2
= (c2 + c3 x + c1 x2 ) + (d2 + d3 x + d1 x2 )
= f2 (c1 x + c2 y + c3 z) + f2 (d1 x + d2 y + d3 z)
and scalar multiplication.

f2 r ¬∑ (c1 x + c2 y + c3 z) = f2 (rc1 x + rc2 y + rc3 z)
= rc2 + rc3 x + rc1 x2
= r ¬∑ (c2 + c3 x + c1 x2 )
= r ¬∑ f2 (c1 x + c2 y + c3 z)
‚àº P2 .
Thus f2 is an isomorphism. We write V =
1.6 Example Every space is isomorphic to itself under the identity map. The
check is easy.

Checking that these are automorphisms is Exercise 33.
1.9 Example Consider the space P5 of polynomials of degree 5 or less and the
map f that sends a polynomial p(x) to p(x ‚àí 1). For instance, under this map
x2 7‚Üí (x ‚àí 1)2 = x2 ‚àí 2x + 1 and x3 + 2x 7‚Üí (x ‚àí 1)3 + 2(x ‚àí 1) = x3 ‚àí 3x2 + 5x ‚àí 3.
This map is an automorphism of this space; the check is Exercise 25.
This isomorphism of P5 with itself does more than just tell us that the space
is ‚Äúthe same‚Äù as itself. It gives us some insight into the space‚Äôs structure. Below
is a family of parabolas, graphs of members of P5 . Each has a vertex at y = ‚àí1,

right by one. Thus, f(p0 ) = p1 , and f‚Äôs action is to shift all of the parabolas
to the right by one. Notice that the picture before f is applied is the same as
the picture after f is applied because while each parabola moves to the right,
another one comes in from the left to take its place. This also holds true for
cubics, etc. So the automorphism f expresses the idea that P5 has a certain
horizontal-homogeneity: if we draw two pictures showing all members of P5 , one

picture centered at x = 0 and the other centered at x = 1, then the two pictures
would be indistinguishable.
As described in the opening to this section, having given the definition of
isomorphism, we next look to support the thesis that it captures our intuition of
vector spaces being the same. First, the definition itself is persuasive: a vector
space consists of a set and some structure and the definition simply requires that
the sets correspond and that the structures correspond also. Also persuasive
are the examples above, such as Example 1.1, which dramatize that isomorphic
‚àº W,
spaces are the same in all relevant respects. Sometimes people say, where V =
that ‚ÄúW is just V painted green‚Äù ‚Äî differences are merely cosmetic.
The results below further support our contention that under an isomorphism
all the things of interest in the two vector spaces correspond. Because we
introduced vector spaces to study linear combinations, ‚Äúof interest‚Äù means
‚Äúpertaining to linear combinations.‚Äù Not of interest is the way that the vectors
are presented typographically (or their color!).
1.10 Lemma An isomorphism maps a zero vector to a zero vector.
Proof Where f : V ‚Üí W is an isomorphism, fix some ~v ‚àà V. Then f(~0V ) =

f(0 ¬∑ ~v) = 0 ¬∑ f(~v) = ~0W .

QED

1.11 Lemma For any map f : V ‚Üí W between vector spaces these statements are
equivalent.
(1) f preserves structure
f(~v1 + ~v2 ) = f(~v1 ) + f(~v2 )

and

f(c~v) = c f(~v)

(2) f preserves linear combinations of two vectors
f(c1~v1 + c2~v2 ) = c1 f(~v1 ) + c2 f(~v2 )
(3) f preserves linear combinations of any finite number of vectors
f(c1~v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~vn ) = c1 f(~v1 ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn f(~vn )
Proof Since the implications (3) =‚áí (2) and (2) =‚áí (1) are clear, we need

only show that (1) =‚áí (3). So assume statement (1). We will prove (3) by
induction on the number of summands n.
The one-summand base case, that f(c~v1 ) = c f(~v1 ), is covered by the second
clause of statement (1).
For the inductive step assume that statement (3) holds whenever there are k
or fewer summands. Consider the k + 1-summand case. Use the first half of (1)

172

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

to break the sum along the final ‚Äò+‚Äô.
f(c1~v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck~vk + ck+1~vk+1 ) = f(c1~v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck~vk ) + f(ck+1~vk+1 )
Use the inductive hypothesis to break up the k-term sum on the left.
= f(c1~v1 ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + f(ck~vk ) + f(ck+1~vk+1 )
Now the second half of (1) gives
= c1 f(~v1 ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck f(~vk ) + ck+1 f(~vk+1 )
when applied k + 1 times.

QED

We often use item (2) to simplify the verification that a map preserves structure.
Finally, a summary. In the prior chapter, after giving the definition of a
vector space, we looked at examples and noted that some spaces seemed to be
‚àº and have
essentially the same as others. Here we have defined the relation ‚Äò=‚Äô
argued that it is the right way to precisely say what we mean by ‚Äúthe same‚Äù
because it preserves the features of interest in a vector space ‚Äî in particular, it
preserves linear combinations. In the next section we will show that isomorphism
is an equivalence relation and so partitions the collection of vector spaces.

the map f : U √ó W ‚Üí V given by

is an isomorphism. Thus if the internal direct sum is defined then the internal
and external direct sums are isomorphic.

I.2

Dimension Characterizes Isomorphism

In the prior subsection, after stating the definition of isomorphism, we gave some
results supporting our sense that such a map describes spaces as ‚Äúthe same.‚Äù
Here we will develop this intuition. When two (unequal) spaces are isomorphic
we think of them as almost equal, as equivalent. We shall make that precise by
proving that the relationship ‚Äòis isomorphic to‚Äô is an equivalence relation.
2.1 Lemma The inverse of an isomorphism is also an isomorphism.
Proof Suppose that V is isomorphic to W via f : V ‚Üí W. An isomorphism is a

correspondence between the sets so f has an inverse function f‚àí1 : W ‚Üí V that
is also a correspondence.‚àó
We will show that because f preserves linear combinations, so also does f‚àí1 .
Suppose that w

~ 2 ‚àà W. Because it is an isomorphism, f is onto and there

w2 )
since f‚àí1 (~
w1 ) = ~v1 and f‚àí1 (~
w2 ) = ~v2 . With that, by Lemma 1.11‚Äôs second
statement, this map preserves structure.
QED
2.2 Theorem Isomorphism is an equivalence relation between vector spaces.
Proof We must prove that the relation is symmetric, reflexive, and transitive.

To check reflexivity, that any space is isomorphic to itself, consider the
identity map. It is clearly one-to-one and onto. This shows that it preserves
linear combinations.
id(c1 ¬∑ ~v1 + c2 ¬∑ ~v2 ) = c1~v1 + c2~v2 = c1 ¬∑ id(~v1 ) + c2 ¬∑ id(~v2 )
Symmetry, that if V is isomorphic to W then also W is isomorphic to V,
holds by Lemma 2.1 since each isomorphism map from V to W is paired with
an isomorphism from W to V.
To finish we must check transitivity, that if V is isomorphic to W and W
is isomorphic to U then V is isomorphic to U. Let f : V ‚Üí W and g : W ‚Üí U
be isomorphisms. Consider their composition g ‚ó¶ f : V ‚Üí U. Because the composition of correspondences is a correspondence, we need only check that the
composition preserves linear combinations.


g ‚ó¶ f c1 ¬∑ ~v1 + c2 ¬∑ ~v2 = g f( c1 ¬∑ ~v1 + c2 ¬∑ ~v2 )

= g c1 ¬∑ f(~v1 ) + c2 ¬∑ f(~v2 )

= c1 ¬∑ g f(~v1 )) + c2 ¬∑ g(f(~v2 )
= c1 ¬∑ (g ‚ó¶ f) (~v1 ) + c2 ¬∑ (g ‚ó¶ f) (~v2 )
Thus the composition is an isomorphism.

QED

Since it is an equivalence, isomorphism partitions the universe of vector
spaces into classes: each space is in one and only one isomorphism class.
All finite dimensional
vector spaces:

V

The next result characterizes these classes by dimension. That is, we can describe
each class simply by giving the number that is the dimension of all of the spaces
in that class.

2.3 Theorem Vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same
dimension.
In this double implication statement the proof of each half involves a significant idea so we will do the two separately.
2.4 Lemma If spaces are isomorphic then they have the same dimension.
Proof We shall show that an isomorphism of two spaces gives a correspon-

D = hf(Œ≤
correspondence, that for any basis of W the inverse image is a basis for V, follows
from the fact that f‚àí1 is also an isomorphism and so we can apply the prior
sentence to f‚àí1 .)
To see that D spans W, fix any w

onto and so there is a ~v ‚àà V with w

vectors.

QED
2.6 Remark The proof has a sentence about ‚Äòwell-defined.‚Äô Its point is that to be
an isomorphism RepB must be a function, and the definition of function requires
that for all inputs the associated output exists and is determined by the input.
So we must check that every ~v is associated with at least one RepB (~v), and no
more than one.
In the proof we express elements ~v of the domain space as combinations
of members of the basis B and then associate ~v with the column vector of
coefficients. That there is at least one expansion of each ~v holds because B is a
basis and so spans the space.

179

Section I. Isomorphisms

The worry that there is no more than one associated member of the codomain
is subtler. A contrasting example, where an association fails this unique output
requirement, illuminates the issue. Let the domain be P2 and consider a set that
is not a basis (it is not linearly independent, although it does span the space).
A = {1 + 0x + 0x2 , 0 + 1x + 0x2 , 0 + 0x + 1x2 , 1 + 1x + 2x2 }
Call those polynomials Œ±
~ 1, . . . , Œ±
~ 4 . In contrast to the situation when the set
is a basis, here there can be more than one expression of a domain vector in
terms of members of the set. For instance, consider ~v = 1 + x + x2 . Here are
two different expansions.
~v = 1~
Œ±1 + 1~
Œ±2 + 1~
Œ±3 + 0~
Œ±4

~v = 0~
Œ±1 + 0~
Œ±2 ‚àí 1~
Œ±3 + 1~
Œ±4

So this input vector ~v is associated with more than one column.

Thus, with A the association is not well-defined. (The issue is that A is not
linearly independent; to show uniqueness Theorem Two.III.1.12‚Äôs proof uses only
linear independence.)
In general, any time that we define a function we must check that output
values are well-defined. Most of the time that condition is perfectly obvious but
in the above proof it needs verification. See Exercise 21.
2.7 Corollary Each finite-dimensional vector space is isomorphic to one and only
one of the Rn .
This gives us a collection of representatives of the isomorphism classes.

vector spaces:

We close with a recap. Recall that the first chapter defines two matrices to be
row equivalent if they can be derived from each other by row operations. There
we showed that relation is an equivalence and so the collection of matrices is
partitioned into classes, where all the matrices that are row equivalent together
fall into a single class. Then for insight into which matrices are in each class we
gave representatives for the classes, the reduced echelon form matrices.
In this section we have followed that pattern except that the notion here
of ‚Äúthe same‚Äù is vector space isomorphism. We defined it and established some
properties, including that it is an equivalence. Then, as before, we developed
a list of class representatives to help us understand the partition ‚Äî it classifies
vector spaces by dimension.
In Chapter Two, with the definition of vector spaces, we seemed to have
opened up our studies to many examples of new structures besides the familiar
Rn ‚Äôs. We now know that isn‚Äôt the case. Any finite-dimensional vector space is
actually ‚Äúthe same‚Äù as a real space.

Homomorphisms

The definition of isomorphism has two conditions. In this section we will consider
the second one. We will study maps that are required only to preserve structure,
maps that are not also required to be correspondences.
Experience shows that these maps are tremendously useful. For one thing
we shall see in the second subsection below that while isomorphisms describe
how spaces are the same, we can think of these maps as describing how spaces
are alike.

1.1 Definition A function between vector spaces h : V ‚Üí W that preserves addition
if ~v1 ,~v2 ‚àà V then h(~v1 + ~v2 ) = h(~v1 ) + h(~v2 )
and scalar multiplication
if ~v ‚àà V and r ‚àà R then h(r ¬∑ ~v) = r ¬∑ h(~v)
is a homomorphism or linear map.

1.3 Example The domain and codomain can be other than spaces of column
vectors. Both of these are homomorphisms; the verifications are straightforward.
(1) f1 : P2 ‚Üí P3 given by

So one way to think of ‚Äòhomomorphism‚Äô is that we are generalizing ‚Äòisomorphism‚Äô (by dropping the condition that the map is a correspondence), motivated
by the observation that many of the properties of isomorphisms have only to
do with the map‚Äôs structure-preservation property. The next two results are
examples of this motivation. In the prior section we saw a proof for each that
only uses preservation of addition and preservation of scalar multiplication, and
therefore applies to homomorphisms.
1.6 Lemma A homomorphism sends the zero vector to the zero vector.
1.7 Lemma The following are equivalent for any map f : V ‚Üí W between vector
spaces.
(1) f is a homomorphism
(2) f(c1 ¬∑~v1 + c2 ¬∑~v2 ) = c1 ¬∑ f(~v1 ) + c2 ¬∑ f(~v2 ) for any c1 , c2 ‚àà R and ~v1 ,~v2 ‚àà V
(3) f(c1 ¬∑~v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn ¬∑~vn ) = c1 ¬∑ f(~v1 ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn ¬∑ f(~vn ) for any c1 , . . . , cn ‚àà R

However, some things that hold for isomorphisms fail to hold for homomorphisms. One example is in the proof of Lemma I.2.4, which shows that
an isomorphism between spaces gives a correspondence between their bases.
Homomorphisms do not give any such correspondence; Example 1.2 shows this
and another example is the zero map between two nontrivial spaces. Instead,
for homomorphisms we have a weaker but still very useful result.
1.9 Theorem A homomorphism is determined by its action on a basis: if V is a vec~ 1, . . . , Œ≤
~ n i, if W is a vector space, and if w
tor space with basis hŒ≤
~ 1, . . . , w
~n ‚ààW
(these codomain elements need not be distinct) then there exists a homomor~ i to w
phism from V to W sending each Œ≤
~ i , and that homomorphism is unique.

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

Proof For any input ~v ‚àà V let its expression with respect to the basis be
~ 1 +¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑+cn Œ≤
~ n . Define the associated output by using the same coordinates
~v = c1 Œ≤
h(~v) = c1 w
~ 1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn w
~ n . This is well defined because, with respect to the
basis, the representation of each domain vector ~v is unique.
This map is a homomorphism because it preserves linear combinations: where
~ 1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn Œ≤
~ n and v~2 = d1 Œ≤
~ 1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + dn Œ≤
~ n , here is the calculation.
v~1 = c1 Œ≤

h(r1~v1 + r2~v2 ) = h( (r1 c1 + r2 d1 )Œ≤
= (r1 c1 + r2 d1 )~
w1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (r1 cn + r2 dn )~
wn
= r1 h(~v1 ) + r2 h(~v2 )
This map is unique because if hÃÇ : V ‚Üí W is another homomorphism satisfying
~ i) = w
~ i for each i then h and hÃÇ have the same effect on all of the
that hÃÇ(Œ≤
vectors in the domain.
~ 1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn Œ≤

~ 1 ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn hÃÇ(Œ≤
~ n)
hÃÇ(~v) = hÃÇ(c1 Œ≤
= c1 w
~ 1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn w
~ n = h(~v)
They have the same action so they are the same function.

the codomain equals the domain. However, be aware that other sources may
instead use it as a synonym for ‚Äòhomomorphism‚Äô.

1.17 Lemma For vector spaces V and W, the set of linear functions from V to
W is itself a vector space, a subspace of the space of all functions from V to W.
We denote the space of linear maps from V to W by L(V, W).
Proof This set is non-empty because it contains the zero homomorphism. So

to show that it is a subspace we need only check that it is closed under the

188

operations. Let f, g : V ‚Üí W be linear. Then the operation of function addition
is preserved
(f + g)(c1~v1 + c2~v2 ) = f(c1~v1 + c2~v2 ) + g(c1~v1 + c2~v2 )
= c1 f(~v1 ) + c2 f(~v2 ) + c1 g(~v1 ) + c2 g(~v2 )


= c1 f + g (~v1 ) + c2 f + g (~v2 )
as is the operation of scalar multiplication of a function.
(r ¬∑ f)(c1~v1 + c2~v2 ) = r(c1 f(~v1 ) + c2 f(~v2 ))
= c1 (r ¬∑ f)(~v1 ) + c2 (r ¬∑ f)(~v2 )
Hence L(V, W) is a subspace.

QED

We started this section by defining ‚Äòhomomorphism‚Äô as a generalization of
‚Äòisomorphism‚Äô, by isolating the structure preservation property. Some of the
points about isomorphisms carried over unchanged, while we adapted others.
Note, however, that the idea of ‚Äòhomomorphism‚Äô is in no way somehow
secondary to that of ‚Äòisomorphism‚Äô. In the rest of this chapter we shall work
mostly with homomorphisms. This is partly because any statement made about
homomorphisms is automatically true about isomorphisms but more because,
while the isomorphism concept is more natural, our experience will show that
the homomorphism concept is more fruitful and more central to progress.

Range space and Null space

Isomorphisms and homomorphisms both preserve structure. The difference is
that homomorphisms have fewer restrictions, since they needn‚Äôt be onto and
needn‚Äôt be one-to-one. We will examine what can happen with homomorphisms
that cannot happen with isomorphisms.
First consider the fact that homomorphisms need not be onto. Of course,
each function is onto some set, namely its range. For example, the injection
map Œπ : R2 ‚Üí R3

is a homomorphism, and is not onto R3 . But it is onto the xy-plane.
2.1 Lemma Under a homomorphism, the image of any subspace of the domain is
a subspace of the codomain. In particular, the image of the entire space, the
range of the homomorphism, is a subspace of the codomain.

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

Proof Let h : V ‚Üí W be linear and let S be a subspace of the domain V. The

image h(S) is a subset of the codomain W, which is nonempty because S is
nonempty. Thus, to show that h(S) is a subspace of W we need only show that
it is closed under linear combinations of two vectors. If h(~s1 ) and h(~s2 ) are
members of h(S) then c1 ¬∑h(~s1 )+c2 ¬∑h(~s2 ) = h(c1 ¬∑~s1 )+h(c2 ¬∑~s2 ) = h(c1 ¬∑~s1 +c2 ¬∑~s2 )
is also a member of h(S) because it is the image of c1 ¬∑ ~s1 + c2 ¬∑ ~s2 from S. QED
2.2 Definition The range space of a homomorphism h : V ‚Üí W is
R(h) = { h(~v) | ~v ‚àà V }
sometimes denoted h(V). The dimension of the range space is the map‚Äôs rank.
We shall soon see the connection between the rank of a map and the rank of a
matrix.
2.3 Example For the derivative map d/dx : P3 ‚Üí P3 given by a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 +
a3 x3 7‚Üí a1 + 2a2 x + 3a3 x2 the range space R(d/dx) is the set of quadratic
polynomials { r + sx + tx2 | r, s, t ‚àà R }. Thus, this map‚Äôs rank is 3.
2.4 Example With this homomorphism h : M2√ó2 ‚Üí P3
a
c

d

!
7‚Üí (a + b + 2d) + cx2 + cx3

an image vector in the range can have any constant term, must have an x
coefficient of zero, and must have the same coefficient of x2 as of x3 . That is,
the range space is R(h) = { r + sx2 + sx3 | r, s ‚àà R } and so the rank is 2.
The prior result shows that, in passing from the definition of isomorphism to
the more general definition of homomorphism, omitting the onto requirement
doesn‚Äôt make an essential difference. Any homomorphism is onto some space,
namely its range.
However, omitting the one-to-one condition does make a difference. A
homomorphism may have many elements of the domain that map to one element
of the codomain. Below is a bean sketch of a many-to-one map between sets.‚àó It
shows three elements of the codomain that are each the image of many members
of the domain. (Rather than picture lots of individual 7‚Üí arrows, each association
of many inputs with one output shows only one such arrow.)

More information on many-to-one maps is in the appendix.

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

In generalizing from isomorphisms to homomorphisms by dropping the oneto-one condition we lose the property that, intuitively, the domain is ‚Äúthe same‚Äù
as the range. We lose, that is, that the domain corresponds perfectly to the range.
The examples below illustrate that what we retain is that a homomorphism
describes how the domain is ‚Äúanalogous to‚Äù or ‚Äúlike‚Äù the range.
2.7 Example We think of R3 as like R2 except that vectors have an extra
component. That is, we think of the vector with components x, y, and z as
like the vector with components x and y. Defining the projection map œÄ makes
precise which members of the domain we are thinking of as related to which
members of the codomain.
To understanding how the preservation conditions in the definition of homomorphism show that the domain elements are like the codomain elements, start
by picturing R2 as the xy-plane inside of R3 (the xy plane inside of R3 is a set
of three-tall vectors with a third component of zero and so does not precisely
equal the set of two-tall vectors R2 , but this embedding makes the picture much
clearer). The preservation of addition property says that vectors in R3 act like
their shadows in the plane.

Thinking of œÄ(~v) as the ‚Äúshadow‚Äù of ~v in the plane gives this restatement: the
sum of the shadows œÄ(~v1 ) + œÄ(~v2 ) equals the shadow of the sum œÄ(~v1 + ~v2 ).
Preservation of scalar multiplication is similar.
Drawing the codomain R2 on the right gives a picture that is uglier but is
more faithful to the bean sketch above.

Again, the domain vectors that map to w

~ 1 vector.‚Äù Similarly,
there is a vertical line of ‚Äú w
~ 2 vectors‚Äù and a vertical line of ‚Äú w
~1+w
~ 2 vectors.‚Äù

195

Section II. Homomorphisms

Now, saying that œÄ is a homomorphism is recognizing that if œÄ(~v1 ) = w
~1
and œÄ(~v2 ) = w
~ 2 then œÄ(~v1 + ~v2 ) = œÄ(~v1 ) + œÄ(~v2 ) = w
~1 +w
~ 2 . That is, the
classes add: any w
~ 1 vector plus any w
~ 2 vector equals a w
~1+w
~ 2 vector. Scalar
multiplication is similar.
So although R3 and R2 are not isomorphic œÄ describes a way in which they
are alike: vectors in R3 add as do the associated vectors in R2 ‚Äî vectors add as
their shadows add.
2.8 Example A homomorphism can express an analogy between spaces that is
more subtle than the prior one. For the map from Example 2.6
!
x
h
7‚àí‚Üí x + y
y
fix two numbers in the range w1 , w2 ‚àà R. A ~v1 that maps to w1 has components
that add to w1 , so the inverse image h‚àí1 (w1 ) is the set of vectors with endpoint
on the diagonal line x + y = w1 . Think of these as ‚Äúw1 vectors.‚Äù Similarly we
have ‚Äúw2 vectors‚Äù and ‚Äúw1 + w2 vectors.‚Äù The addition preservation property
says this.
~v1 + ~v2
~v1

~v2

a ‚Äúw2 vector‚Äù

equals

a ‚Äúw1 + w2 vector‚Äù

Restated, if we add a w1 vector to a w2 vector then h maps the result to a
w1 + w2 vector. Briefly, the sum of the images is the image of the sum. Even
more briefly, h(~v1 ) + h(~v2 ) = h(~v1 + ~v2 ).

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

We won‚Äôt describe how every homomorphism that we will use is an analogy
because the formal sense that we make of ‚Äúalike in that . . . ‚Äù is ‚Äòa homomorphism
exists such that . . . ‚Äô. Nonetheless, the idea that a homomorphism between two
spaces expresses how the domain‚Äôs vectors fall into classes that act like the
range‚Äôs vectors is a good way to view homomorphisms.
Another reason that we won‚Äôt treat all of the homomorphisms that we see as
above is that many vector spaces are hard to draw, e.g., a space of polynomials.
But there is nothing wrong with leveraging spaces that we can draw: from the
three examples 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 we draw two insights.
The first insight is that in all three examples the inverse image of the range‚Äôs
zero vector is a line or plane through the origin. It is therefore a subspace of the
domain.
2.10 Lemma For any homomorphism the inverse image of a subspace of the
range is a subspace of the domain. In particular, the inverse image of the trivial
subspace of the range is a subspace of the domain.
(The examples above consider inverse images of single vectors but this result
is about inverse images of sets h‚àí1 (S) = {~v ‚àà V | h(~v) ‚àà S}. We use the same
term for both by taking the inverse image of a single element h‚àí1 (~
w) to be the
‚àí1
inverse image of the one-element set h ({ w
~ }).)
Proof Let h : V ‚Üí W be a homomorphism and let S be a subspace of the range

space of h. Consider the inverse image of S. It is nonempty because it contains
~0V , since h(~0V ) = ~0W and ~0W is an element of S as S is a subspace. To finish we
show that h‚àí1 (S) is closed under linear combinations. Let ~v1 and ~v2 be two of
its elements, so that h(~v1 ) and h(~v2 ) are elements of S. Then c1~v1 + c2~v2 is an
element of the inverse image h‚àí1 (S) because h(c1~v1 + c2~v2 ) = c1 h(~v1 ) + c2 h(~v2 )
is a member of S.
QED
2.11 Definition The null space or kernel of a linear map h : V ‚Üí W is the inverse
image of ~0W .
N (h) = h‚àí1 (~0W ) = {~v ‚àà V | h(~v) = ~0W }
The dimension of the null space is the map‚Äôs nullity.

{a0 + 0x + 0x2 + 0x3 | a0 ‚àà R } so its nullity is 1.

N (h) = {
| a, b ‚àà R}

Now for the second insight from the above examples. In Example 2.7 each of
the vertical lines squashes down to a single point ‚Äî in passing from the domain to
the range, œÄ takes all of these one-dimensional vertical lines and maps them to a
point, leaving the range smaller than the domain by one dimension. Similarly, in
Example 2.8 the two-dimensional domain compresses to a one-dimensional range
by breaking the domain into the diagonal lines and maps each of those to a single
member of the range. Finally, in Example 2.9 the domain breaks into planes
which get squashed to a point and so the map starts with a three-dimensional
domain but ends two smaller, with a one-dimensional range. (The codomain
is two-dimensional but the range is one-dimensional and the dimension of the
range is what matters.)
2.14 Theorem A linear map‚Äôs rank plus its nullity equals the dimension of its
domain.

2.16 Example If t : R ‚Üí R is the linear transformation x 7‚Üí ‚àí4x, then the range
is R(t) = R. The rank is 1 and the nullity is 0.
2.17 Corollary The rank of a linear map is less than or equal to the dimension of
the domain. Equality holds if and only if the nullity of the map is 0.
We know that an isomorphism exists between two spaces if and only if the
dimension of the range equals the dimension of the domain. We have now seen
that for a homomorphism to exist a necessary condition is that the dimension of
the range must be less than or equal to the dimension of the domain. For instance,
there is no homomorphism from R2 onto R3 . There are many homomorphisms
from R2 into R3 , but none onto.
The range space of a linear map can be of dimension strictly less than the
dimension of the domain and so linearly independent sets in the domain may
map to linearly dependent sets in the range. (Example 2.3‚Äôs derivative transformation on P3 has a domain of dimension 4 but a range of dimension 3 and the
derivative sends { 1, x, x2 , x3 } to {0, 1, 2x, 3x2 }). That is, under a homomorphism
independence may be lost. In contrast, dependence stays.
2.18 Lemma Under a linear map, the image of a linearly dependent set is linearly
dependent.
Proof Suppose that c1~v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~vn = ~0V with some ci nonzero. Apply h to

both sides: h(c1~v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn~vn ) = c1 h(~v1 ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn h(~vn ) and h(~0V ) = ~0W .
Thus we have c1 h(~v1 ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn h(~vn ) = ~0W with some ci nonzero.
QED
When is independence not lost? The obvious sufficient condition is when
the homomorphism is an isomorphism. This condition is also necessary; see

statements about a linear map h : V ‚Üí W.

Proof We will first show that (1) ‚áê‚áí (2). We will then show that (1) =‚áí
(3) =‚áí (4) =‚áí (5) =‚áí (2).
For (1) =‚áí (2), suppose that the linear map h is one-to-one, and therefore
has an inverse h‚àí1 : R(h) ‚Üí V. The domain of that inverse is the range of h and
thus a linear combination of two members of it has the form c1 h(~v1 ) + c2 h(~v2 ).
On that combination, the inverse h‚àí1 gives this.

h‚àí1 (c1 h(~v1 ) + c2 h(~v2 )) = h‚àí1 (h(c1~v1 + c2~v2 ))
= h‚àí1 ‚ó¶ h (c1~v1 + c2~v2 )
= c1~v1 + c2~v2
= c1 ¬∑ h‚àí1 (h(~v1 )) + c2 ¬∑ h‚àí1 (h(~v2 ))
Thus if a linear map has an inverse then the inverse must be linear. But this also
gives the (2) =‚áí (1) implication, because the inverse itself must be one-to-one.
Of the remaining implications, (1) =‚áí (3) holds because any homomorphism
maps ~0V to ~0W , but a one-to-one map sends at most one member of V to ~0W .
Next, (3) =‚áí (4) is true since rank plus nullity equals the dimension of the
domain.

(uniqueness of the representation makes this well-defined). Checking that it is
linear and that it is the inverse of h are easy.
QED
We have seen that a linear map expresses how the structure of the domain is
like that of the range. We can think of such a map as organizing the domain
space into inverse images of points in the range. In the special case that the map
is one-to-one, each inverse image is a single point and the map is an isomorphism
between the domain and the range.

use Theorem 1.9 to show that if the dimension of W is less than or equal to the

In that matrix the number of columns n is the dimension of the map‚Äôs domain
while the number of rows m is the dimension of the codomain.
We use lower case letters for a map, upper case for the matrix, and lower case
again for the entries of the matrix. Thus for the map h, the matrix representing
it is H, with entries hi,j .

Briefly, application of a linear map is represented by the matrix-vector
product of the map‚Äôs representative and the vector‚Äôs representative.
1.6 Remark Theorem 1.4 is not surprising, because we chose the matrix representative in Definition 1.2 precisely to make the theorem true ‚Äî if the theorem

We now have two ways to compute the effect of projection, the straightforward
formula that drops each three-tall vector‚Äôs third component to make a two-tall
vector, and the above formula that uses representations and matrix-vector
multiplication. The second way may seem complicated compared to the first,
but it has advantages. The next example shows that for some maps this new
scheme simplifies the formula.

representing the map.

The advantage of this scheme is that we get a formula for the image of any
vector at all just by knowing in (‚àó) how to represent the image of the two basis
vectors. For instance, here we rotate a vector by Œ∏ = œÄ/6.

two-dimensional space. So the vector cannot be in the domain of the map.
Nothing in Definition 1.5 forces us to view matrix-vector product in terms
of representations. We can get some insights by focusing on how the entries
combine.
A good way to view matrix-vector product is that it is formed from the dot
products of the rows of the matrix with the column vector.

to compute the action of h on any argument knowing only h(Œ≤
We have developed this into a scheme to compute the action of the map by
taking the matrix-vector product of the matrix representing the map with the
vector representing the argument. In this way, with respect to any bases, for any
linear map there is a matrix representation. The next subsection will show the
converse, that if we fix bases then for any matrix there is an associated linear
map.

represented by the matrix so first note that in (‚àó) the dimension of the map‚Äôs
domain is the number of columns n of the matrix and the dimension of the

has a unique representation with respect to the basis B and the calculation of w

These are different functions. The first is projection onto the x-axis while the
second is projection onto the y-axis.
This result means that when convenient we can work solely with matrices,
just doing the computations without having to worry whether a matrix of interest
represents a linear map on some pair of spaces.
When we are working with a matrix but we do not have particular spaces or
bases in mind then we can take the domain and codomain to be Rn and Rm ,
with the standard bases. This is convenient because with the standard bases
vector representation is transparent ‚Äî the representation of ~v is ~v. (In this case
the column space of the matrix equals the range of the map and consequently
the column space of H is often denoted by R(H).)
Given a matrix, to come up with an associated map we can choose among
many domain and codomain spaces, and many bases for those. So a matrix can
represent many maps. We finish this section by illustrating how the matrix can
give us information about the associated maps.
2.4 Theorem The rank of a matrix equals the rank of any map that it represents.

To see that the two spans have the same dimension, recall from the proof
of Lemma I.2.5 that if we fix a basis then representation with respect to that
basis gives an isomorphism RepD : W ‚Üí Rm . Under this isomorphism there is a
linear relationship among members of the range space if and only if the same

and only if 0 = c1 ¬∑ RepD (h(Œ≤1 )) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn ¬∑ RepD (h(Œ≤n )). Hence, a subset of
the range space is linearly independent if and only if the corresponding subset
of the column space is linearly independent. Therefore the size of the largest
linearly independent subset of the range space equals the size of the largest
linearly independent subset of the column space, and so the two spaces have the
same dimension.

That settles the apparent ambiguity in our use of the same word ‚Äòrank‚Äô to
apply both to matrices and to maps.

must have three-dimensional domain and a four-dimensional codomain. In
addition, because the rank of this matrix is two (we can spot this by eye or get it
with Gauss‚Äôs Method), any map represented by this matrix has a two-dimensional
range space.
2.6 Corollary Let h be a linear map represented by a matrix H. Then h is onto
if and only if the rank of H equals the number of its rows, and h is one-to-one if
and only if the rank of H equals the number of its columns.
Proof For the onto half, the dimension of the range space of h is the rank

of h, which equals the rank of H by the theorem. Since the dimension of the
codomain of h equals the number of rows in H, if the rank of H equals the
number of rows then the dimension of the range space equals the dimension
of the codomain. But a subspace with the same dimension as its superspace
must equal that superspace (because any basis for the range space is a linearly
independent subset of the codomain whose size is equal to the dimension of the

Section III. Computing Linear Maps

219

codomain, and thus so this basis for the range space must also be a basis for the
codomain).
For the other half, a linear map is one-to-one if and only if it is an isomorphism
between its domain and its range, that is, if and only if its domain has the same
dimension as its range. The number of columns in H is the dimension of h‚Äôs
domain and by the theorem the rank of H equals the dimension of h‚Äôs range.

it is singular . That is, a linear map is nonsingular if and only if it is an
isomorphism.
2.8 Remark Some authors use ‚Äònonsingular‚Äô as a synonym for one-to-one while
others use it the way that we have here. The difference is slight because any
map is onto its range space, so a one-to-one map is an isomorphism with its
range.
In the first chapter we defined a matrix to be nonsingular if it is square and
is the matrix of coefficients of a linear system with a unique solution. The next
result justifies our dual use of the term.
2.9 Lemma A nonsingular linear map is represented by a square matrix. A
square matrix represents nonsingular maps if and only if it is a nonsingular
matrix. Thus, a matrix represents isomorphisms if and only if it is square and
nonsingular.
Proof Assume that the map h : V ‚Üí W is nonsingular. Corollary 2.6 says that

for any matrix H representing that map, because h is onto the number of rows
of H equals the rank of H, and because h is one-to-one the number of columns
of H is also equal to the rank of H. Hence H is square.
Next assume that H is square, n √ó n. The matrix H is nonsingular if
and only if its row rank is n, which is true if and only if H‚Äôs rank is n by
Theorem Two.III.3.11, which is true if and only if h‚Äôs rank is n by Theorem 2.4,
which is true if and only if h is an isomorphism by Theorem I.2.3. (This last
holds because the domain of h is n-dimensional as it is the number of columns
in H.)

We‚Äôve now seen that the relationship between maps and matrices goes both
ways: for a particular pair of bases, any linear map is represented by a matrix
and any matrix describes a linear map. That is, by fixing spaces and bases we
get a correspondence between maps and matrices. In the rest of this chapter
we will explore this correspondence. For instance, we‚Äôve defined for linear maps
the operations of addition and scalar multiplication and we shall see what the
corresponding matrix operations are. We shall also see the matrix operation
that represent the map operation of composition. And, we shall see how to find
the matrix that represents a map‚Äôs inverse.

2.25 This is an alternative proof of Lemma 2.9. Given an n √ó n matrix H, fix a
domain V and codomain W of appropriate dimension n, and bases B, D for those
spaces, and consider the map h represented by the matrix.
(a) Show that h is onto if and only if there is at least one RepB (~v) associated by
H with each RepD (~
w).
(b) Show that h is one-to-one if and only if there is at most one RepB (~v) associated
by H with each RepD (~
w).
(c) Consider the linear system H¬∑RepB (~v) = RepD (~
w). Show that H is nonsingular
if and only if there is exactly one solution RepB (~v) for each RepD (~
w).
X 2.26 Because the rank of a matrix equals the rank of any map it represents, if
one matrix represents two different maps H = RepB,D (h) = RepBÃÇ,DÃÇ (hÃÇ) (where
h, hÃÇ : V ‚Üí W) then the dimension of the range space of h equals the dimension of
the range space of hÃÇ. Must these equal-dimensional range spaces actually be the
same?
2.27 Let V be an n-dimensional space with bases B and D. Consider a map that
sends, for ~v ‚àà V, the column vector representing ~v with respect to B to the column
vector representing ~v with respect to D. Show that map is a linear transformation
of Rn .
2.28 Example 2.3 shows that changing the pair of bases can change the map that
a matrix represents, even though the domain and codomain remain the same.
Could the map ever not change? Is there a matrix H, vector spaces V and W,
and associated pairs of bases B1 , D1 and B2 , D2 (with B1 6= B2 or D1 6= D2 or
both) such that the map represented by H with respect to B1 , D1 equals the map
represented by H with respect to B2 , D2 ?
X 2.29 A square matrix is a diagonal matrix if it is all zeroes except possibly for the
entries on its upper-left to lower-right diagonal ‚Äî its 1, 1 entry, its 2, 2 entry, etc.
Show that a linear map is an isomorphism if there are bases such that, with respect
to those bases, the map is represented by a diagonal matrix with no zeroes on the
diagonal.

2.31 The fact that for any linear map the rank plus the nullity equals the dimension
of the domain shows that a necessary condition for the existence of a homomorphism
between two spaces, onto the second space, is that there be no gain in dimension.
That is, where h : V ‚Üí W is onto, the dimension of W must be less than or equal
to the dimension of V.
(a) Show that this (strong) converse holds: no gain in dimension implies that
there is a homomorphism and, further, any matrix with the correct size and
correct rank represents such a map.

Matrix Operations

The prior section shows how matrices represent linear maps. We now explore
how this representation interacts with things that we already know. First we
will see how the representation of a scalar product r ¬∑ f of a linear map relates to
the representation of f, and also how the representation of a sum f + g relates to
the representations of the two summands. Later we will do the same comparison
for the map operations of composition and inverse.

IV.1

Sums and Scalar Products

1.1 Example Let f : V ‚Üí W be a linear function represented with respect to some
bases by this matrix.
!
1 0
RepB,D (f) =
1 1
Consider the map that is the scalar multiple 5f : V ‚Üí W. We will relate the
representation RepB,D (5f) with RepB,D (f).
Let f associate ~v 7‚Üí w
~ with these representations.
!
!
v1
w1
RepB (~v) =
RepD (~
w) =
v2
w2
Where the codomain‚Äôs basis is D = h~Œ¥1 , ~Œ¥2 i, that representation gives that the
output vector is w
~ = w1~Œ¥1 + w2~Œ¥2 .
The action of the map 5f is ~v 7‚Üí 5~
w and 5~
w = 5 ¬∑ (w1~Œ¥1 + w2~Œ¥2 ) =
(5w1 )~Œ¥1 + (5w2 )~Œ¥2 . So 5f associates the input vector ~v with the output vector
having this representation.
!
5w1
RepD (5~
w) =
5w2
Changing from the map f to the map 5f has the effect on the representation of
the output vector of multiplying each entry by 5.
Because of that, RepB,D (5f) is this matrix.

Therefore, going from the matrix representing f to the one representing 5f means
multiplying all the matrix entries by 5.

input and output vectors.

(u1 + w1 )~Œ¥1 + (u2 + w2 )~Œ¥2 and so this is the representation of the vector sum.

1.3 Definition The scalar multiple of a matrix is the result of entry-by-entry
scalar multiplication. The sum of two same-sized matrices is their entry-by-entry

These operations extend the first chapter‚Äôs operations of addition and scalar
multiplication of vectors.
We need a result that proves these matrix operations do what the examples
suggest that they do.

1.4 Theorem Let h, g : V ‚Üí W be linear maps represented with respect to bases
B, D by the matrices H and G and let r be a scalar. Then with respect to
B, D the map r ¬∑ h : V ‚Üí W is represented by rH and the map h + g : V ‚Üí W is
represented by H + G.
Proof Generalize the examples. This is Exercise 10.

QED

1.5 Remark These two operations on matrices are simple, but we did not define
them in this way because they are simple. We defined them this way because
they represent function addition and function scalar multiplication. That is,
our program is to define matrix operations by referencing function operations.
Simplicity is a bonus.
We will see this again in the next subsection, where we will define the
operation of multiplying matrices. Since we‚Äôve just defined matrix scalar multiplication and matrix sum to be entry-by-entry operations, a naive thought is
to define matrix multiplication to be the entry-by-entry product. In theory we
could do whatever we please but we will instead be practical and combine the
entries in the way that represents the function operation of composition.
A special case of scalar multiplication is multiplication by zero. For any map
0 ¬∑ h is the zero homomorphism and for any matrix 0 ¬∑ H is the matrix with all
entries zero.
1.6 Definition A zero matrix has all entries 0. We write Zn√óm or simply Z
(another common notation is 0n√óm or just 0).
1.7 Example The zero map from any three-dimensional space to any twodimensional space is represented by the 2√ó3 zero matrix

After representing addition and scalar multiplication of linear maps in the prior
subsection, the natural next operation to consider is function composition.
2.1 Lemma The composition of linear maps is linear.

Theorem I.2.2.) Let h : V ‚Üí W and g : W ‚Üí U be linear. The calculation

g ‚ó¶ h c1 ¬∑ ~v1 + c2 ¬∑ ~v2 = g h(c1 ¬∑ ~v1 + c2 ¬∑ ~v2 ) = g c1 ¬∑ h(~v1 ) + c2 ¬∑ h(~v2 )

= c1 ¬∑ g h(~v1 )) + c2 ¬∑ g(h(~v2 ) = c1 ¬∑ (g ‚ó¶ h)(~v1 ) + c2 ¬∑ (g ‚ó¶ h)(~v2 )
shows that g ‚ó¶ h : V ‚Üí U preserves linear combinations, and so is linear. QED
As we did with the operation of matrix addition and scalar multiplication,
we will see how the representation of the composite relates to the representations
of the compositors by first considering an example.

The matrix representing g ‚ó¶ h has the rows of G combined with the columns of
H.
2.3 Definition The matrix-multiplicative product of the m√ór matrix G and the
r√ón matrix H is the m√ón matrix P, where
pi,j = gi,1 h1,j + gi,2 h2,j + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + gi,r hr,j
so that the i, j-th entry of the product is the dot product of the i-th row of the

2.7 Theorem A composition of linear maps is represented by the matrix product
of the representatives.
Proof This argument generalizes Example 2.2. Let h : V ‚Üí W and g : W ‚Üí X

be represented by H and G with respect to bases B ‚äÇ V, C ‚äÇ W, and D ‚äÇ X, of
sizes n, r, and m. For any ~v ‚àà V the k-th component of RepC ( h(~v) ) is
hk,1 v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + hk,n vn
and so the i-th component of RepD ( g ‚ó¶ h (~v) ) is this.
gi,1 ¬∑ (h1,1 v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + h1,n vn ) + gi,2 ¬∑ (h2,1 v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + h2,n vn )
+ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + gi,r ¬∑ (hr,1 v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + hr,n vn )
Distribute and regroup on the v‚Äôs.
= (gi,1 h1,1 + gi,2 h2,1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + gi,r hr,1 ) ¬∑ v1
+ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (gi,1 h1,n + gi,2 h2,n + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + gi,r hr,n ) ¬∑ vn
Finish by recognizing that the coefficient of each vj
gi,1 h1,j + gi,2 h2,j + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + gi,r hr,j
matches the definition of the i, j entry of the product GH.

same effect

~v 7‚àí‚Üí h(~v) 7‚àí‚Üí g(h(~v))
(this is just the definition of composition). Below the arrows, the matrices
indicate that multiplying GH into the column vector RepB (~v) has the same
effect as multiplying the column vector first by H and then multiplying the
result by G.
RepB,D (g ‚ó¶ h) = GH

RepC,D (g) RepB,C (h) = GH

As mentioned in Example 2.5, because the number of columns on the left
does not equal the number of rows on the right, the product as here of a 2√ó3
matrix with a 2√ó2 matrix is not defined.

The definition requires that the sizes match because we want that the underlying
function composition is possible.

(‚àó)

Thus, matrix product combines the m√ór matrix G with the r√ón matrix F to
yield the m√ón result GF. Briefly: m√ór times r√ón equals m√ón.
2.8 Remark The order of the dimensions can be confusing. In ‚Äòm√ór times r√ó
n equals m√ón‚Äô the number written first is m. But m appears last in the map
dimension description line (‚àó) above, and the other dimensions also appear in
reverse. The explanation is that while h is done first, followed by g, we write
the composition as g ‚ó¶ h, with g on the left (arising from the notation g(h(~v))).
That carries over to matrices, so that g ‚ó¶ h is represented by GH.
We can get insight into matrix-matrix product operation by studying how
the entries combine. For instance, an alternative way to understand why we
require above that the sizes match is that the row of the left-hand matrix must
have the same number of entries as the column of the right-hand matrix, or else
some entry will be left without a matching entry from the other matrix.
Another aspect of the combinatorics of matrix multiplication, in the sum
defining the i, j entry, is brought out here by the boxing the equal subscripts.
pi,j = gi, 1 h 1 ,j + gi, 2 h 2 ,j + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + gi, r h r ,j
The highlighted subscripts on the g‚Äôs are column indices while those on the h‚Äôs
are for rows. That is, the summation takes place over the columns of G but

232

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

over the rows of H ‚Äî the definition treats left differently than right. So we may
reasonably suspect that GH can be unequal to HG.

2.11 Remark The fact that matrix multiplication is not commutative can seem
odd at first, perhaps because most mathematical operations in prior courses are
commutative. But matrix multiplication represents function composition and
function composition is not commutative: if f(x) = 2x and g(x) = x + 1 then
g ‚ó¶ f(x) = 2x + 1 while f ‚ó¶ g(x) = 2(x + 1) = 2x + 2.
Except for the lack of commutativity, matrix multiplication is algebraically
well-behaved. The next result gives some nice properties and more are in
Exercise 25 and Exercise 26.
2.12 Theorem If F, G, and H are matrices, and the matrix products are defined,
then the product is associative (FG)H = F(GH) and distributes over matrix
addition F(G + H) = FG + FH and (G + H)F = GF + HF.
Proof Associativity holds because matrix multiplication represents function

composition, which is associative: the maps (f ‚ó¶ g) ‚ó¶ h and f ‚ó¶ (g ‚ó¶ h) are equal
as both send ~v to f(g(h(~v))).
Distributivity is similar. For instance, the first one goes f ‚ó¶ (g + h) (~v) =


f (g + h)(~v) = f g(~v) + h(~v) = f(g(~v)) + f(h(~v)) = f ‚ó¶ g(~v) + f ‚ó¶ h(~v) (the
third equality uses the linearity of f). Right-distributivity goes the same way.
QED

2.13 Remark We could instead prove that result by slogging through indices. For

233

Section IV. Matrix Operations
example, for associativity the i, j entry of (FG)H is
(fi,1 g1,1 + fi,2 g2,1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + fi,r gr,1 )h1,j
+ (fi,1 g1,2 + fi,2 g2,2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + fi,r gr,2 )h2,j

fi,1 g1,1 h1,j + fi,2 g2,1 h1,j + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + fi,r gr,1 h1,j

+ fi,1 g1,s hs,j + fi,2 g2,s hs,j + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + fi,r gr,s hs,j

+ fi,2 (g2,1 h1,j + g2,2 h2,j + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + g2,s hs,j )
..
.
+ fi,r (gr,1 h1,j + gr,2 h2,j + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + gr,s hs,j )

to get the i, j entry of F(GH).
Contrast the two proofs. The index-heavy argument is hard to understand in
that while the calculations are easy to check, the arithmetic seems unconnected
to any idea. The argument in the proof is shorter and also says why this property
‚Äúreally‚Äù holds. This illustrates the comments made at the start of the chapter on
vector spaces ‚Äî at least sometimes an argument from higher-level constructs is
clearer.
We have now seen how to represent the composition of linear maps. The
next subsection will continue to explore this operation.

Mechanics of Matrix Multiplication

We can consider matrix multiplication as a mechanical process, putting aside for
the moment any implications about the underlying maps.
The striking thing about this operation is the way that rows and columns
combine. The i, j entry of the matrix product is the dot product of row i of the
left matrix with column j of the right one. For instance, here a second row and
a third column combine to make a 2, 3 entry.

We can view this as the left matrix acting by multiplying its rows into the
columns of the right matrix. Or, it is the right matrix using its columns to act
on the rows of the left matrix. Below, we will examine actions from the left and
from the right for some simple matrices.
Simplest is the zero matrix.

In short, an identity matrix is the identity element of the set of n√ón matrices
with respect to the operation of matrix multiplication.
We can generalize the identity matrix by relaxing the ones to arbitrary reals.
The resulting matrix rescales whole rows or columns.

3.23 Corollary For any matrix H there are elementary reduction matrices R1 , . . . ,
Rr such that Rr ¬∑ Rr‚àí1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ R1 ¬∑ H is in reduced echelon form.
Until now we have taken the point of view that our primary objects of study
are vector spaces and the maps between them, and we seemed to have adopted
matrices only for computational convenience. This subsection show that this
isn‚Äôt the entire story.
Understanding matrix operations by understanding the mechanics of how
the entries combine is also useful. In the rest of this book we shall continue to
focus on maps as the primary objects but we will be pragmatic ‚Äî if the matrix
point of view gives some clearer idea then we will go with it.

there are no roads directly connecting some pairs of towns. For instance, there is no way to go from
Winooski to Grand Isle without going through Colchester. (To simplify the graph many other roads
and towns have been omitted. From
top to bottom of this map is about

3.47 Give an example of two matrices of the same rank and size with squares of
differing rank.
3.48 On a computer multiplications have traditionally been more costly than additions, so people have tried to in reduce the number of multiplications used to
compute a matrix product.
(a) How many real number multiplications do we need in the formula we gave for
the product of a m√ór matrix and a r√ón matrix?
(b) Matrix multiplication is associative, so all associations yield the same result.
The cost in number of multiplications, however, varies. Find the association
requiring the fewest real number multiplications to compute the matrix product
of a 5√ó10 matrix, a 10√ó20 matrix, a 20√ó5 matrix, and a 5√ó1 matrix.

Inverses

We finish this section by considering how to represent the inverse of a linear map.
We first recall some things about inverses. Where œÄ : R3 ‚Üí R2 is the projection
map and Œπ : R2 ‚Üí R3 is the embedding

We say that Œπ is a right inverse of œÄ or, what is the same thing, that œÄ is a
left inverse of Œπ. However, composition in the other order Œπ ‚ó¶ œÄ doesn‚Äôt give the
identity map ‚Äî here is a vector that is not sent to itself under Œπ ‚ó¶ œÄ.

for all of the infinitely many z‚Äôs. But a function f cannot send a single argument

x
y to more than one value.
So a function can have a right inverse but no left inverse, or a left inverse
but no right inverse. A function can also fail to have an inverse on either side;
one example is the zero transformation on R2 .
Some functions have a two-sided inverse, another function that is the inverse
both from the left and from the right. For instance, the transformation given by
~v 7‚Üí 2 ¬∑ ~v has the two-sided inverse ~v 7‚Üí (1/2) ¬∑ ~v. The appendix shows that a
function has a two-sided inverse if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto.
The appendix also shows that if a function f has a two-sided inverse then it is
unique, so we call it ‚Äòthe‚Äô inverse and write f‚àí1 .
In addition, recall that we have shown in Theorem II.2.20 that if a linear
map has a two-sided inverse then that inverse is also linear.
Thus, our goal in this subsection is, where a linear h has an inverse, to find
the relationship between RepB,D (h) and RepD,B (h‚àí1 ).
4.1 Definition A matrix G is a left inverse matrix of the matrix H if GH is the
identity matrix. It is a right inverse if HG is the identity. A matrix H with
a two-sided inverse is an invertible matrix. That two-sided inverse is denoted
H‚àí1 .
Because of the correspondence between linear maps and matrices, statements
about map inverses translate into statements about matrix inverses.

248

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

4.2 Lemma If a matrix has both a left inverse and a right inverse then the two
are equal.
4.3 Theorem A matrix is invertible if and only if it is nonsingular.
Proof (For both results.) Given a matrix H, fix spaces of appropriate dimension

for the domain and codomain and fix bases for these spaces. With respect to
these bases, H represents a map h. The statements are true about the map and
therefore they are true about the matrix.
QED
4.4 Lemma A product of invertible matrices is invertible: if G and H are invertible
and GH is defined then GH is invertible and (GH)‚àí1 = H‚àí1 G‚àí1 .
Proof Because the two matrices are invertible they are square, and because

their product is defined they must both be n√ón. Fix spaces and bases ‚Äî say,
Rn with the standard bases ‚Äî to get maps g, h : Rn ‚Üí Rn that are associated
with the matrices, G = RepEn ,En (g) and H = RepEn ,En (h).
Consider h‚àí1 g‚àí1 . By the prior paragraph this composition is defined. This
map is a two-sided inverse of gh since (h‚àí1 g‚àí1 )(gh) = h‚àí1 (id)h = h‚àí1 h = id
and (gh)(h‚àí1 g‚àí1 ) = g(id)g‚àí1 = gg‚àí1 = id. The matrices representing the
maps reflect this equality.

Beyond its place in our program of seeing how to represent map operations,
another reason for our interest in inverses comes from linear systems. A linear
system is equivalent to a matrix equation, as here.

By fixing spaces and bases (for instance, R2 , R2 with the standard bases), we
take the matrix H to represent a map h. The matrix equation then becomes
this linear map equation.
h(~x) = ~d

249

Section IV. Matrix Operations

If we had a left inverse map g then we could apply it to both sides g‚ó¶h(~x) = g(~d)
to get ~x = g(~d). Restating in terms of the matrices, we want to multiply by the
inverse matrix RepC,B (g) ¬∑ RepC (~d) to get RepB (~x).
4.5 Example We can find a left inverse for the matrix just given

Answer: m = 1/3, n = 1/3, p = 2/3, and q = ‚àí1/3. (This matrix is actually
the two-sided inverse of H; the check is easy.) With it, we can solve the system
from the prior example.

4.6 Remark Why do inverse matrices when we have Gauss‚Äôs Method? Beyond
the conceptual appeal of representing the map inverse operation, solving linear
systems this way has two advantages.
First, once we have done the work of finding an inverse then solving a
system with the same coefficients but different constants is fast: if we change
the constants on the right of the system above then we get a related problem

Another advantage of inverses is that we can explore a system‚Äôs sensitivity
to changes in the constants. For example, tweaking the 3 on the right of the
prior example‚Äôs system to

shows that the first component of the solution changes by 1/3 of the tweak,
while the second component moves by 2/3 of the tweak. This is sensitivity
analysis. We could use it to decide how accurately we must specify the data in
a linear model to ensure that the solution has a desired accuracy.
4.7 Lemma A matrix H is invertible if and only if it can be written as the product
of elementary reduction matrices. We can compute the inverse by applying to
the identity matrix the same row steps, in the same order, that Gauss-Jordan
reduce H.
Proof The matrix H is invertible if and only if it is nonsingular and thus

Gauss-Jordan reduces to the identity. By Corollary 3.23 we can do this reduction
with elementary matrices.
Rr ¬∑ Rr‚àí1 . . . R1 ¬∑ H = I

(‚àó)

For the first sentence of the result, note that elementary matrices are invertible
because elementary row operations are reversible, and that their inverses are also
elementary. Apply R‚àí1
from the left to both sides of (‚àó). Then apply R‚àí1
r
r‚àí1 , etc.
The result gives H as the product of elementary matrices H = R‚àí1
¬∑

(The I there covers the case r = 0.)
For the second sentence, group (‚àó) as (Rr ¬∑ Rr‚àí1 . . . R1 ) ¬∑ H = I and recognize
what‚Äôs in the parentheses as the inverse H‚àí1 = Rr ¬∑ Rr‚àí1 . . . R1 ¬∑ I. Restated:
applying R1 to the identity, followed by R2 , etc., yields the inverse of H. QED

QED

We have seen in this subsection, as in the subsection on Mechanics of Matrix
Multiplication, how to exploit the correspondence between linear maps and
matrices. We can fruitfully study both maps and matrices, translating back and
forth to use whichever is handiest.
Over the course of this entire section we have developed an algebra system
for matrices. We can compare it with the familiar algebra of real numbers.

252

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

Matrix addition and subtraction work in much the same way as the real number
operations except that they only combine same-sized matrices. Scalar multiplication is in some ways an extension of real number multiplication. We also have
a matrix multiplication operation and its inverse that are somewhat like the
familiar real number operations (associativity, and distributivity over addition,
for example), but there are differences (failure of commutativity). This section
provides an example that algebra systems other than the usual real number one
can be interesting and useful.

Changing Representations of Vectors

In converting RepB (~v) to RepD (~v) the underlying vector ~v doesn‚Äôt change. Thus,
the translation between these two ways of expressing the vector is accomplished
by the identity map on the space, described so that the domain space vectors are
represented with respect to B and the codomain space vectors are represented
with respect to D.

1.3 Lemma Left-multiplication by the change of basis matrix for B, D converts
a representation with respect to B to one with respect to D. Conversely, if
left-multiplication by a matrix changes bases M ¬∑ RepB (~v) = RepD (~v) then M is
a change of basis matrix.
Proof The first sentence holds because matrix-vector multiplication represents

a map application and so RepB,D (id) ¬∑ RepB (~v) = RepD ( id(~v) ) = RepD (~v) for
each ~v. For the second sentence, with respect to B, D the matrix M represents
a linear map whose action is to map each vector to itself, and is therefore the
identity map.

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

1.5 Lemma A matrix changes bases if and only if it is nonsingular.
Proof For the ‚Äòonly if‚Äô direction, if left-multiplication by a matrix changes

bases then the matrix represents an invertible function, simply because we can
invert the function by changing the bases back. Because it represents a function
that is invertible, the matrix itself is invertible, and so is nonsingular.
For ‚Äòif‚Äô we will show that any nonsingular matrix M performs a change of
basis operation from any given starting basis B (having n vectors, where the
matrix is n√ón) to some ending basis.
If the matrix is the identity I then the statement is obvious. Otherwise
because the matrix is nonsingular Corollary IV.3.23 says there are elementary
reduction matrices such that Rr ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ R1 ¬∑ M = I with r > 1. Elementary matrices
are invertible and their inverses are also elementary so multiplying both sides of
that equation from the left by Rr ‚àí1 , then by Rr‚àí1 ‚àí1 , etc., gives M as a product
of elementary matrices M = R1 ‚àí1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Rr ‚àí1 .
We will be done if we show that elementary matrices change a given basis to
another basis, since then Rr ‚àí1 changes B to some other basis Br and Rr‚àí1 ‚àí1
changes Br to some Br‚àí1 , etc. We will cover the three types of elementary
matrices separately; recall the notation for the three.

Changing Map Representations

The first subsection shows how to convert the representation of a vector with
respect to one basis to the representation of that same vector with respect to
another basis. We next convert the representation of a map with respect to one
pair of bases to the representation with respect to a different pair ‚Äî we convert
from RepB,D (h) to RepBÃÇ,DÃÇ (h). Here is the arrow diagram.

To move from the lower-left to the lower-right we can either go straight over,
or else up to VB then over to WD and then down. So we can calculate HÃÇ =
RepBÃÇ,DÃÇ (h) either by directly using BÃÇ and DÃÇ, or else by first changing bases with
RepBÃÇ,B (id) then multiplying by H = RepB,D (h) and then changing bases with
RepD,DÃÇ (id).

top, and then down on the right, with TÃÇ = RepE2 ,DÃÇ (id) ¬∑ T ¬∑ RepBÃÇ,E2 (id). (Note
again that the matrix multiplication reads right to left, as the three functions
are composed and function composition reads right to left.)
Find the matrix for the left-hand side, the matrix RepBÃÇ,E2 (id), in the usual
way: find the effect of the identity matrix on the starting basis BÃÇ ‚Äî which of
course is no effect at all ‚Äî and then represent those basis elements with respect
to the ending basis E3 .

This calculation is easy when the ending basis is the standard one.
There are two ways to compute the matrix for going down the square‚Äôs right
side, RepE2 ,DÃÇ (id). We could calculate it directly as we did for the other change
of basis matrix. Or, we could instead calculate it as the inverse of the matrix
for going up RepDÃÇ,E2 (id). Find that matrix is easy, and we have a formula for
the 2√ó2 inverse so that‚Äôs what is in the equation below.

Naturally we usually prefer representations that are easier to understand.
We say that a map or matrix has been diagonalized when we find a basis B such
that the representation is diagonal with respect to B, B, that is, with respect
to the same starting basis as ending basis. Chapter Five finds which maps and
matrices are diagonalizable.

262

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

The rest of this subsection develops the easier case of finding two bases B, D
such that a representation is simple. Recall that the prior subsection shows that
a matrix is a change of basis matrix if and only if it is nonsingular.
2.3 Definition Same-sized matrices H and HÃÇ are matrix equivalent if there are
nonsingular matrices P and Q such that HÃÇ = PHQ.
2.4 Corollary Matrix equivalent matrices represent the same map, with respect
to appropriate pairs of bases.
Proof This is immediate from equation (‚àó) above.

QED

Exercise 23 checks that matrix equivalence is an equivalence relation. Thus
it partitions the set of matrices into matrix equivalence classes.
All matrices:

H
HÃÇ

...

H matrix equivalent
to HÃÇ

We can get insight into the classes by comparing matrix equivalence with row
equivalence (remember that matrices are row equivalent when they can be
reduced to each other by row operations). In HÃÇ = PHQ, the matrices P and Q
are nonsingular and thus each is a product of elementary reduction matrices
by Lemma IV.4.7. Left-multiplication by the reduction matrices making up P
performs row operations. Right-multiplication by the reduction matrices making
up Q performs column operations. Hence, matrix equivalence is a generalization
of row equivalence ‚Äî two matrices are row equivalent if one can be converted to
the other by a sequence of row reduction steps, while two matrices are matrix
equivalent if one can be converted to the other by a sequence of row reduction
steps followed by a sequence of column reduction steps.
Consequently, if matrices are row equivalent then they are also matrix
equivalent since we can take Q to be the identity matrix. The converse, however,
does not hold: two matrices can be matrix equivalent but not row equivalent.
2.5 Example These two are matrix equivalent
!
!
1 0

because the second reduces to the first by the column operation of taking ‚àí1
times the first column and adding to the second. They are not row equivalent
because they have different reduced echelon forms (both are already in reduced
form).

263

Section V. Change of Basis

We close this section by giving a set of representatives for the matrix equivalence classes.

Projection

This section is optional. It is a prerequisite only for the final two sections
of Chapter Five, and some Topics.

So perhaps a better description is: the projection of ~v is the vector ~p in the plane
with the property that someone standing on ~p and looking straight up or down ‚Äî
that is, looking orthogonally to the plane ‚Äî sees the tip of ~v. In this section we
will generalize this to other projections, orthogonal and non-orthogonal.

VI.1

Orthogonal Projection Into a Line

We first consider orthogonal projection of a vector ~v into a line `. This shows
a figure walking out on the line to a point ~p such that the tip of ~v is directly
above them, where ‚Äúabove‚Äù does not mean parallel to the y-axis but instead
means orthogonal to the line.

Since the line is the span of some vector ` = {c ¬∑ ~s | c ‚àà R }, we have a coefficient
c~p with the property that ~v ‚àí c~p~s is orthogonal to c~p~s.

~v

~v ‚àí c~p ~s
c~p ~s

268

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

To solve for this coefficient, observe that because ~v ‚àí c~p~s is orthogonal to a
scalar multiple of ~s, it must be orthogonal to ~s itself. Then (~v ‚àí c~p~s) ‚Ä¢ ~s = 0
gives that c~p = ~v ‚Ä¢ ~s/~s ‚Ä¢ ~s.
1.1 Definition The orthogonal projection of ~v into the line spanned by a
nonzero ~s is this vector.
~v ‚Ä¢ ~s
proj[~s ] (~v) =
¬∑ ~s
~s ‚Ä¢ ~s
(That says ‚Äòspanned by ~s ‚Äô instead the more formal ‚Äòspan of the set {~s }‚Äô. This
more casual phrase is common.)

The picture above showing the figure walking out on the line until ~v‚Äôs tip is
overhead is one way to think of the orthogonal projection of a vector into a line.
We finish this subsection with two other ways.

269

Section VI. Projection

1.4 Example A railroad car left on an east-west track without its brake is pushed
by a wind blowing toward the northeast at fifteen miles per hour; what speed
will the car reach?

For the wind we use a vector of length 15 that points toward the northeast.
!
p
15p1/2
~v =
15 1/2
The car is only affected by the part of the wind blowing in the east-west
direction ‚Äî the part of ~v in the direction of the x-axis is this (the picture has
the same perspective as the railroad car picture above).
north

~p =
east

So the car will reach a velocity of 15

p

15

!
p
1/2
0

1/2 miles per hour toward the east.

Thus, another way to think of the picture that precedes the definition is that
it shows ~v as decomposed into two parts, the part ~p with the line, and the part
that is orthogonal to the line (shown above on the north-south axis). These
two are non-interacting in the sense that the east-west car is not at all affected
by the north-south part of the wind (see Exercise 10). So we can think of the
orthogonal projection of ~v into the line spanned by ~s as the part of ~v that lies
in the direction of ~s.
Still another useful way to think of orthogonal projection into a line is to
have the person stand on the vector, not the line. This person holds a rope
looped over the line. As they pull, the loop slides on the line.

When it is tight, the rope is orthogonal to the line. That is, we can think of the
projection ~p as being the vector in the line that is closest to ~v (see Exercise 17).
1.5 Example A submarine is tracking a ship moving along the line y = 3x + 2.
Torpedo range is one-half mile. If the sub stays where it is, at the origin on the
chart below, will the ship pass within range?

270

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

east

The formula for projection into a line does not immediately apply because the
line doesn‚Äôt pass through the origin, and so isn‚Äôt the span of any ~s. To adjust
for this, we start by shifting the entire map down two units. Now the line is
y = 3x, a subspace. We project to get the point ~p on the line closest to

Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization

decomposes that vector into two parts

that are orthogonal and so are ‚Äúnon-interacting.‚Äù We now develop that suggestion.
2.1 Definition Vectors ~v1 , . . . ,~vk ‚àà Rn are mutually orthogonal when any two
are orthogonal: if i 6= j then the dot product ~vi ‚Ä¢ ~vj is zero.
2.2 Theorem If the vectors in a set {~v1 , . . . ,~vk } ‚äÇ Rn are mutually orthogonal
and nonzero then that set is linearly independent.
Proof Consider ~0 = c1~v1 + c2~v2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck~vk . For i ‚àà { 1, .. , k }, taking the dot

product of ~vi with both sides of the equation ~vi ‚Ä¢ (c1~v1 +c2~v2 +¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑+ck~vk ) = ~vi ‚Ä¢~0,
which gives ci ¬∑ (~vi ‚Ä¢ ~vi ) = 0, shows that ci = 0 since ~vi 6= ~0.

2.3 Corollary In a k dimensional vector space, if the vectors in a size k set are

Proof Any linearly independent size k subset of a k dimensional space is a

QED

Of course, the converse of Corollary 2.3 does not hold ‚Äî not every basis of
every subspace of Rn has mutually orthogonal vectors. However, we can get
the partial converse that for every subspace of Rn there is at least one basis

normalize each vector by dividing by its length, to end with an orthonormal

Projection Into a Subspace

This subsection uses material from the optional earlier subsection on Combining Subspaces.
The prior subsections project a vector into a line by decomposing it into two
parts: the part in the line proj[~s ] (~v ) and the rest ~v ‚àí proj[~s ] (~v ). To generalize
projection to arbitrary subspaces we will follow this decomposition idea.

Notice that the projection along N is not orthogonal since there are members
of the plane M that are not orthogonal to the dotted line. But the projection
along NÃÇ is orthogonal.
We have seen two projection operations, orthogonal projection into a line as
well as this subsections‚Äôs projection into an M and along an N, and we naturally
ask whether they are related. The right-hand picture above suggests the answer ‚Äî
orthogonal projection into a line is a special case of this subsection‚Äôs projection;
it is projection along a subspace perpendicular to the line.

3.4 Definition The orthogonal complement of a subspace M of Rn is
M‚ä• = {~v ‚àà Rn | ~v is perpendicular to all vectors in M}
(read ‚ÄúM perp‚Äù). The orthogonal projection projM (~v ) of a vector is its projection into M along M‚ä• .

3.7 Lemma If M is a subspace of Rn then its orthogonal complement M‚ä• is also
a subspace. The space is the direct sum of the two Rn = M ‚äï M‚ä• . And, for
any ~v ‚àà Rn the vector ~v ‚àí projM (~v ) is perpendicular to every vector in M.
Proof First, the orthogonal complement M‚ä• is a subspace of Rn because it is

a null space, namely the null space of the orthogonal projection map.
To show that the space M is the direct sum of the two, start with any basis
BM = h~¬µ1 , . . . , ~¬µk i for M and expand it to a basis for the entire space. Apply

282

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

the Gram-Schmidt process to get an orthogonal basis K = h~Œ∫1 , . . . , ~Œ∫n i for Rn .
This K is the concatenation of two bases: h~Œ∫1 , . . . , ~Œ∫k i with the same number of
members k as BM , and h~Œ∫k+1 , . . . , ~Œ∫n i. The first is a basis for M so if we show
that the second is a basis for M‚ä• then we will have that the entire space is the
direct sum.
Exercise 22 from the prior subsection proves this about any orthogonal
basis: each vector ~v in the space is the sum of its orthogonal projections into
the lines spanned by the basis vectors.
~v = proj[~Œ∫1 ] (~v ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + proj[~Œ∫n ] (~v )

(‚àó)

To check this, represent the vector as ~v = r1~Œ∫1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + rn~Œ∫n , apply ~Œ∫i to both
sides ~v ‚Ä¢ ~Œ∫i = (r1~Œ∫1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + rn~Œ∫n ) ‚Ä¢ ~Œ∫i = r1 ¬∑ 0 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ri ¬∑ (~Œ∫i ‚Ä¢ ~Œ∫i ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + rn ¬∑ 0,
and solve to get ri = (~v ‚Ä¢ ~Œ∫i )/(~Œ∫i ‚Ä¢ ~Œ∫i ), as desired.
Since obviously any member of the span of h~Œ∫k+1 , . . . , ~Œ∫n i is orthogonal to
any vector in M, to show that this is a basis for M‚ä• we need only show the
other containment ‚Äî that any w
~ ‚àà M‚ä• is in the span of this basis. The prior
paragraph does this. Any w
~ ‚àà M‚ä• gives this on projections into basis vectors
from M: proj[~Œ∫1 ] (~
w ) = ~0, . . . , proj[~Œ∫k ] (~
w ) = ~0. Therefore equation (‚àó) gives
that w
~ is a linear combination of ~Œ∫k+1 , . . . , ~Œ∫n . Thus this is a basis for M‚ä• and
n
R is the direct sum of the two.
The final sentence of the lemma is proved in much the same way. Write
~v = proj[~Œ∫1 ] (~v ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + proj[~Œ∫n ] (~v ). Then projM (~v ) keeps only the M part and
drops the M‚ä• part projM (~v ) = proj[~Œ∫k+1 ] (~v ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + proj[~Œ∫k ] (~v ). Therefore
~v ‚àí projM (~v ) consists of a linear combination of elements of M‚ä• and so is
perpendicular to every vector in M.
QED
Given a subspace, we could compute the orthogonal projection into that
subspace by following the steps of that proof: finding a basis, expanding it
to a basis for the entire space, applying Gram-Schmidt to get an orthogonal
basis, and projecting into each linear subspace. However we will instead use a
convenient formula.

Line of Best Fit
This Topic requires the formulas from the subsections on Orthogonal Projection Into a Line and Projection Into a Subspace.
Scientists are often presented with a system that has no solution and they
must find an answer anyway. More precisely, they must find a best answer.
For instance, this is the result of flipping a penny, including some intermediate
numbers.

Because of the randomness in this experiment we expect that the ratio of heads
to flips will fluctuate around a penny‚Äôs long-term ratio of 50-50. So the system
for such an experiment likely has no solution, and that‚Äôs what happened here.
30m = 16
60m = 34

it would be.

An orthogonal projection of the data vector into the line subspace gives a best

The estimate (m = 7110/12600 ‚âà 0.56) is a bit more than one half, but not
much more than half, so probably the penny is fair enough.
The line with the slope m ‚âà 0.56 is the line of best fit for this data.

Minimizing the distance between the given vector and the vector used as the
right-hand side minimizes the total of these vertical lengths, and consequently
we say that the line comes from fitting by least-squares.

This diagram exaggerates the vertical scale by a factor of ten to make the lengths
more visible.
In the above equation the line must pass through (0, 0), because we take it
to be the line whose slope is this coin‚Äôs true proportion of heads to flips. We
can also handle cases where the line need not pass through the origin.
Here is the progression of world record times for the men‚Äôs mile race
[Oakley & Baker]. In the early 1900‚Äôs many people wondered when, or if, this
record would fall below the four minute mark. Here are the times that were in
force on January first of each decade through the first half of that century.

We can use this to give a circa 1950 prediction of the date for 240 seconds, and
then compare that to the actual date. As with the penny data, these numbers
do not lie in a perfect line. That is, this system does not have an exact solution
for the slope and intercept.

.
b + 1950m = 241.4
We find a best approximation by using orthogonal projection.

the same result as entering all of the dates and records. There are different
sequences of times from competing standards bodies but the ones here are from
[Wikipedia, Mens Mile]. We‚Äôve started the plot at 1870 because at one point
there were two classes of records, called ‚Äòprofessional‚Äô and ‚Äòamateur‚Äô, and after a
while the first class stopped being active so we‚Äôve followed the second class.)

The final example compares team salaries from US major league baseball
against the number of wins the team had, for the year 2002. In this year the

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

Oakland Athletics used mathematical techniques to optimize the players that
they fielded for the money that they could spend, as told in the film Moneyball.
(Salaries are in millions of dollars and the number of wins is out of 162 games).
To do the computations we again use Sage.

Judging this line by eye would be error-prone. So the equations give us a
certainty about the ‚Äòbest‚Äô in best fit. In addition, the model‚Äôs equation tells us
roughly that by spending an additional million dollars a team owner can expect
to buy 1/4 of a win (and that expectation is not very sure, thank goodness).

and that the line of best fit doesn‚Äôt in that case have any predictive value.) In a
highway restaurant a trucker told me that his boss often sends him by a roundabout
route, using more gas but paying lower bridge tolls. He said that New York State
calibrates the toll for each bridge across the Hudson, playing off the extra gas to
get there from New York City against a lower crossing cost, to encourage people to
go upstate. This table, from [Cost Of Tolls] and [Google Maps], lists for each toll
crossing of the Hudson River, the distance to drive from Times Square in miles
and the cost in US dollars for a passenger car (if a crossings has a one-way toll
then it shows half that number).

294

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

The nonlinear maps distort the domain in transforming it into the range. For
instance, f1 (1) is further from f1 (2) than it is from f1 (0) ‚Äî this map spreads the
domain out unevenly so that a domain interval near x = 2 is spread apart more
than is a domain interval near x = 0. The linear maps are nicer, more regular,
in that for each map all of the domain spreads by the same factor. The map h1
on the left spreads all intervals apart to be twice as wide while on the right h2
keeps intervals the same length but reverses their orientation, as with the rising
interval from 1 to 2 being transformed to the falling interval from ‚àí1 to ‚àí2.
The only linear maps from R to R are multiplications by a scalar but in
higher dimensions more can happen. For instance, this linear transformation of
R2 rotates vectors counterclockwise.

Despite this additional variety, even in higher dimensions linear maps behave
nicely. Consider a linear h : Rn ‚Üí Rm and use the standard bases to represent it
by a matrix H. Recall from Theorem V.2.6 that H factors into H = PBQ where P
and Q are nonsingular and B is a partial-identity matrix. Recall also that nonsingular matrices factor into elementary matrices PBQ = Tn Tn‚àí1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Ts BTs‚àí1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ T1 ,
which are matrices that come from the identity I after one Gaussian row operation, so each T matrix is one of these three kinds

the effect of any linear map. (The pictures below stick to transformations of R2
for ease of drawing but the principles extend for maps from any Rn to any Rm .)

slide up 4, as was ~v. That is, the transformation represented by Ci,j (k) affects
vectors depending on their i-th component.
Another way to see this point is to consider the action of this map on the
unit square. In the next picture, vectors with a first component of 0, such as the
origin, are not pushed vertically at all but vectors with a positive first component
slide up. Here, all vectors with a first component of 1, the entire right side of
the square, slide to the same extent. In general, vectors on the same vertical
line slide by the same amount, by twice their first component. The resulting
shape has the same base and height as the square (and thus the same area) but
the right angle corners are gone.

In general, for any Ci,j (k), the sliding happens so that vectors with the same
i-th component are slid by the same amount. This kind of map is a shear.
With that we understand the geometric effect of the four types of matrices
on the right-hand side of H = Tn Tn‚àí1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Tj BTj‚àí1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ T1 and so in some sense we
understand the action of any matrix H. Thus, even in higher dimensions the
geometry of linear maps is easy: it is built by putting together a number of
components, each of which acts in a simple way.
We will apply this understanding in two ways. The first way is to prove
something general about the geometry of linear maps. Recall that under a linear
map, the image of a subspace is a subspace and thus the linear transformation
h represented by H maps lines through the origin to lines through the origin.
(The dimension of the image space cannot be greater than the dimension of the
domain space, so a line can‚Äôt map onto, say, a plane.) We will show that h maps
any line ‚Äî not just one through the origin ‚Äî to a line. The proof is simple: the
partial-identity projection B and the elementary Ti ‚Äôs each turn a line input into
a line output; verifying the four cases is Exercise 5. Therefore their composition
also preserves lines.

Topic: Geometry of Linear Maps

The second way that we will apply the geometric understanding of linear
maps is to elucidate a point from Calculus. Below is a picture of the action of
the one-variable real function y(x) = x2 + x. As with the nonlinear functions
pictured earlier, the geometric effect of this map is irregular in that at different
domain points it has different effects; for example as the input x goes from 2 to
‚àí2, the associated output f(x) at first decreases, then pauses for an instant, and
then increases.

But in Calculus we focus less on the map overall and more on the local effect
of the map. Below we look closely at what this map does near x = 1. The
derivative is dy/dx = 2x + 1 so that near x = 1 we have ‚àÜy ‚âà 3 ¬∑ ‚àÜx. That is, in
a neighborhood of x = 1, in carrying the domain over this map causes it to grow
by a factor of 3 ‚Äî it is, locally, approximately, a dilation. The picture below
shows this as a small interval in the domain (1 ‚àí ‚àÜx .. 1 + ‚àÜx) carried over to an
interval in the codomain (2 ‚àí ‚àÜy .. 2 + ‚àÜy) that is three times as wide.

y=2
x=1

In higher dimensions the core idea is the same but more can happen. For a
function y : Rn ‚Üí Rm and a point ~x ‚àà Rn , the derivative is defined to be the
linear map h : Rn ‚Üí Rm that best approximates how y changes near y(~x). So
the geometry described above directly applies to the derivative.
We close by remarking how this point of view makes clear an often misunderstood result about derivatives, the Chain Rule. Recall that, under suitable

conditions on the two functions, the derivative of the composition is this.

For instance the derivative of sin(x2 + 3x) is cos(x2 + 3x) ¬∑ (2x + 3).
Where does this come from? Consider f, g : R ‚Üí R.

g(f(x))

f(x)
x

The first map f dilates the neighborhood of x by a factor of
df
(x)
dx
and the second map g follows that by dilating a neighborhood of f(x) by a factor
of
dg
( f(x) )
dx
and when combined, the composition dilates by the product of the two. In
higher dimensions the map expressing how a function changes near a point is
a linear map, and is represented by a matrix. The Chain Rule multiplies the
matrices.

determined by p. That is, although a particular permutation could be expressed in
two different ways with two different numbers of swaps, either both ways use an
even number of swaps, or both use an odd number.)

Magic Squares
A Chinese legend tells the story of a flood by the Lo river. People offered
sacrifices to appease the river. Each time a turtle emerged, walked around the
sacrifice, and returned to the water. Fuh-Hi, the founder of Chinese civilization,
interpreted this to mean that the river was still cranky. Fortunately, a child
noticed that on its shell the turtle had the pattern on the left below, which is
today called Lo Shu (‚Äúriver scroll‚Äù).

The dots make the matrix on the right where the rows, columns, and diagonals
add to 15. Now that the people knew how much to sacrifice, the river‚Äôs anger
cooled.
A square matrix is magic if each row, column, and diagonal add to the same
number, the matrix‚Äôs magic number.
Another magic square appears in the engraving Melencolia I by D√ºrer.

One interpretation is that it depicts melancholy, a depressed state. The figure,
genius, has a wealth of fascinating things to explore including the compass, the
geometrical solid, the scale, and the hourglass. But the figure is unmoved; all of
the things lie unused. One of the potential delights, in the upper right, is a 4√ó4
matrix whose rows, columns, and diagonals add to 34.

The middle entries on the bottom row give 1514, the date of the engraving.
The above two squares are arrangements of 1 . . . n2 . They are normal. The
1√ó1 square whose sole entry is 1 is normal, Exercise 2 shows that there is no normal 2√ó2 magic square, and there are normal magic squares of every other size; see
[Wikipedia, Magic Square]. Finding how many normal magic squares there are of
each size is an unsolved problem; see [Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences].
If we don‚Äôt require that the squares be normal then we can say much more.
Every 1√ó1 square is magic, trivially. If the rows, columns, and diagonals of a
2√ó2 matrix
!
a b
c d
add to s then a + b = s, c + d = s, a + c = s, b + d = s, a + d = s, and b + c = s.
Exercise 2 shows that this system has the unique solution a = b = c = d = s/2.
So the set of 2√ó2 magic squares is a one-dimensional subspace of M2√ó2 .
A sum of two same-sized magic squares is magic and a scalar multiple of a
magic square is magic so the set of n√ón magic squares Mn is a vector space,
a subspace of Mn√ón . This Topic shows that for n > 3 the dimension of Mn is
n2 ‚àí n. The set Mn,0 of n√ón magic squares with magic number 0 is another
subspace and we will verify the formula for its dimension also: n2 ‚àí 2n ‚àí 1 when
n > 3.
We will first prove that dim Mn = dim Mn,0 + 1. Define the trace of a
matrix to be the sum down its upper-left to lower-right diagonal Tr(M) =
m1,1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + mn,n . Consider the restriction of the trace to the magic squares
Tr : Mn ‚Üí R. The null space N (Tr) is the set of magic squares with magic
number zero Mn,0 . Observe that the trace is onto because for any r in the
codomain R the n√ón matrix whose entries are all r/n is a magic square with
magic number r. Theorem Two.II.2.14 says that for any linear map the dimension

302

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

of the domain equals the dimension of the range space plus the dimension of the
null space, the map‚Äôs rank plus its nullity. Here the domain is Mn , the range
space is R and the null space is Mn,0 , so we have that dim Mn = 1 + dim Mn,0 .
We will finish by finding the dimension of the vector space Mn,0 . For n = 1
the dimension is clearly 0. Exercise 3 shows that dim Mn,0 is also 0 for n = 2.
That leaves showing that dim Mn,0 = n2 ‚àí 2n ‚àí 1 for n > 3. The fact that
the squares in this vector space are magic gives us a linear system of restrictions,
and the fact that they have magic number zero makes this system homogeneous:
for instance consider the 3√ó3 case. The restriction that the rows, columns, and
diagonals of

We will find the dimension of the space by finding the number of free variables
in the linear system.
The matrix of coefficients for the particular cases of n = 3 and n = 4 are
below, with the rows and columns numbered to help in reading the proof. With
2
respect to the standard basis, each represents a linear map h : Rn ‚Üí R2n+2 .
The domain has dimension n2 so if we show that the rank of the matrix is 2n + 1
then we will have what we want, that the dimension of the null space Mn,0 is
n2 ‚àí (2n + 1).

We want to show that the rank of the matrix of coefficients, the number of
rows in a maximal linearly independent set, is 2n + 1. The first n rows of the
matrix of coefficients add to the same vector as the second n rows, the vector of
all ones. So a maximal linearly independent must omit at least one row. We will
show that the set of all rows but the first {~œÅ2 . . . ~œÅ2n+2 } is linearly independent.
So consider this linear relationship.
c2~œÅ2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c2n~œÅ2n + c2n+1~œÅ2n+1 + c2n+2~œÅ2n+2 = ~0

(‚àó)

Now it gets messy. Focus on the lower left of the tables. Observe that in the
final two rows, in the first n columns, is a subrow that is all zeros except that it
starts with a one in column 1 and a subrow that is all zeros except that it ends
with a one in column n.
First, with ~œÅ1 omitted, both column 1 and column n contain only two ones.
Since the only rows in (‚àó) with nonzero column 1 entries are rows ~œÅn+1 and
~œÅ2n+1 , which have ones, we must have c2n+1 = ‚àícn+1 . Likewise considering
the n-th entries of the vectors in (‚àó) gives that c2n+2 = ‚àíc2n .
Next consider the columns between those two ‚Äî in the n = 3 table this
includes only column 2 while in the n = 4 table it includes both columns 2
and 3. Each such column has a single one. That is, for each column index
j ‚àà {2 . . . n ‚àí 2} the column consists of only zeros except for a one in row n + j,
and hence cn+j = 0.
On to the next block of columns, from n + 1 through 2n. Column n + 1 has
only two ones (because n > 3 the ones in the last two rows do not fall in the first
column of this block). Thus c2 = ‚àícn+1 and therefore c2 = c2n+1 . Likewise,
from column 2n we conclude that c2 = ‚àíc2n and so c2 = c2n+2 .
Because n > 3 there is at least one column between column n + 1 and
column 2n ‚àí 1. In at least one of those columns a one appears in ~œÅ2n+1 . If a one
also appears in that column in ~œÅ2n+2 then we have c2 = ‚àí(c2n+1 + c2n+2 ) since

304

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

cn+j = 0 for j ‚àà {2 . . . n ‚àí 2}. If a one does not appear in that column in ~œÅ2n+2
then we have c2 = ‚àíc2n+1 . In either case c2 = 0, and thus c2n+1 = c2n+2 = 0
and cn+1 = c2n = 0.
If the next block of n-many columns is not the last then similarly conclude
from its first column that c3 = cn+1 = 0.
Keep this up until we reach the last block of columns, those numbered
(n ‚àí 1)n + 1 through n2 . Because cn+1 = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = c2n = 0 column n2 gives that
cn = ‚àíc2n+1 = 0.
Therefore the rank of the matrix is 2n + 1, as required.
The classic source on normal magic squares is [Ball & Coxeter]. More on the
Lo Shu square is at [Wikipedia, Lo Shu Square]. The proof given here began
with [Ward].

Markov Chains
Here is a simple game: a player bets on coin tosses, a dollar each time, and the
game ends either when the player has no money or is up to five dollars. If the
player starts with three dollars, what is the chance that the game takes at least
five flips? Twenty-five flips?
At any point, this player has either $0, or $1, . . . , or $5. We say that the
player is in the state s0 , s1 , . . . , or s5 . In the game the player moves from state
to state. For instance, a player now in state s3 has on the next flip a 0.5 chance
of moving to state s2 and a 0.5 chance of moving to s4 . The boundary states
are different; a player never leaves state s0 or state s5 .
Let pi (n) be the probability that the player is in state si after n flips. Then
for instance the probability of being in state s0 after flip n + 1 is p0 (n + 1) =
p0 (n) + 0.5 ¬∑ p1 (n). This equation summarizes.

This game is not likely to go on for long since the player quickly moves to an
ending state. For instance, after the fourth flip there is already a 0.50 probability
that the game is over.
This is a Markov chain. Each vector is a probability vector, whose entries
are nonnegative real numbers that sum to 1. The matrix is a transition matrix
or stochastic matrix, whose entries are nonnegative reals and whose columns
sum to 1.
A characteristic feature of a Markov chain model is that it is historyless in
that the next state depends only on the current state, not on any prior ones.
Thus, a player who arrives at s2 by starting in state s3 and then going to state s2
has exactly the same chance of moving next to s3 as does a player whose history

Here is a Markov chain from sociology. A study ([Macdonald & Ridge],
p. 202) divided occupations in the United Kingdom into three levels: executives
and professionals, supervisors and skilled manual workers, and unskilled workers.
They asked about two thousand men, ‚ÄúAt what level are you, and at what level
was your father when you were fourteen years old?‚Äù Here the Markov model
assumption about history may seem reasonable ‚Äî we may guess that while a
parent‚Äôs occupation has a direct influence on the occupation of the child, the
grandparent‚Äôs occupation likely has no such direct influence. This summarizes
the study‚Äôs conclusions.

One more example. In professional American baseball there are two leagues,
the American League and the National League. At the end of the annual season
the team winning the American League and the team winning the National
League play the World Series. The winner is the first team to take four games.
That means that a series is in one of twenty-four states: 0-0 (no games won
yet by either team), 1-0 (one game won for the American League team and no
games for the National League team), etc.
Consider a series with a probability p that the American League team wins
each game. We have this.

Markov chains are a widely used application of matrix operations. They
also give us an example of the use of matrices where we do not consider the
significance of the maps represented by the matrices. For more on Markov chains,
there are many sources such as [Kemeny & Snell] and [Iosifescu].

jump right from undecided to sure that A is the correct thing to do (or B). Instead,
the learner spends some time in a ‚Äútentative-A‚Äù state, or a ‚Äútentative-B‚Äù state,
trying the response out (denoted here tA and tB ). Imagine that once the learner has

Orthonormal Matrices
In The Elements, Euclid considers two figures to be the same if they have the
same size and shape. That is, while the triangles below are not equal because
they are not the same set of points, they are, for Euclid‚Äôs purposes, essentially
indistinguishable because we can imagine picking the plane up, sliding it over
and rotating it a bit, although not warping or stretching it, and then putting it
back down, to superimpose the first figure on the second. (Euclid never explicitly
states this principle but he uses it often [Casey].)
P2
P1

Q2
P3

Q1
Q3

In modern terms ‚Äúpicking the plane up . . . ‚Äù is taking a map from the plane to
itself. Euclid considers only transformations that may slide or turn the plane but
not bend or stretch it. Accordingly, define a map f : R2 ‚Üí R2 to be distancepreserving or a rigid motion or an isometry if for all points P1 , P2 ‚àà R2 , the
distance from f(P1 ) to f(P2 ) equals the distance from P1 to P2 . We also define a
plane figure to be a set of points in the plane and we say that two figures are
congruent if there is a distance-preserving map from the plane to itself that
carries one figure onto the other.
Many statements from Euclidean geometry follow easily from these definitions.
Some are: (i) collinearity is invariant under any distance-preserving map (that is,
if P1 , P2 , and P3 are collinear then so are f(P1 ), f(P2 ), and f(P3 )), (ii) betweeness
is invariant under any distance-preserving map (if P2 is between P1 and P3 then
so is f(P2 ) between f(P1 ) and f(P3 )), (iii) the property of being a triangle is
invariant under any distance-preserving map (if a figure is a triangle then the
image of that figure is also a triangle), (iv) and the property of being a circle is
invariant under any distance-preserving map. In 1872, F. Klein suggested that
we can define Euclidean geometry as the study of properties that are invariant

312

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

under these maps. (This forms part of Klein‚Äôs Erlanger Program, which proposes
the organizing principle that we can describe each kind of geometry ‚Äî Euclidean,
projective, etc. ‚Äî as the study of the properties that are invariant under some
group of transformations. The word ‚Äògroup‚Äô here means more than just ‚Äòcollection‚Äô
but that lies outside of our scope.)
We can use linear algebra to characterize the distance-preserving maps of
the plane.
To begin, observe that there are distance-preserving transformations of the
plane that are not linear. The obvious example is this translation.

However, this example turns out to be the only one, in that if f is distancepreserving and sends ~0 to ~v0 then the map ~v 7‚Üí f(~v) ‚àí ~v0 is linear. That will
follow immediately from this statement: a map t that is distance-preserving
and sends ~0 to itself is linear. To prove this equivalent statement, consider the
standard basis and suppose that

Recall that if we fix three non-collinear points then we can determine any point
by giving its distance from those three. So we can determine any point ~v in the
domain by its distance from ~0, ~e1 , and ~e2 . Similarly, we can determine any point
t(~v) in the codomain by its distance from the three fixed points t(~0), t(~e1 ), and
t(~e2 ) (these three are not collinear because, as mentioned above, collinearity is
invariant and ~0, ~e1 , and ~e2 are not collinear). Because t is distance-preserving
we can say more: for the point ~v in the plane that is determined by being the
distance d0 from ~0, the distance d1 from ~e1 , and the distance d2 from ~e2 , its
image t(~v) must be the unique point in the codomain that is determined by
being d0 from t(~0), d1 from t(~e1 ), and d2 from t(~e2 ). Because of the uniqueness,

suffices to show that (‚àó) describes t. Those checks are routine.
Thus any distance-preserving f : R2 ‚Üí R2 is a linear map plus a translation,
f(~v) = t(~v) + ~v0 for some constant vector ~v0 and linear map t that is distancepreserving. So in order to understand distance-preserving maps what remains is
to understand distance-preserving linear maps.
Not every linear map is distance-preserving. For example ~v 7‚Üí 2~v does not
preserve distances.
But there is a neat characterization: a linear transformation t of the plane
is distance-preserving if and only if both kt(~e1 )k = kt(~e2 )k = 1, and t(~e1 ) is
orthogonal to t(~e2 ). The ‚Äòonly if‚Äô half of that statement is easy ‚Äî because t
is distance-preserving it must preserve the lengths of vectors and because t
is distance-preserving the Pythagorean theorem shows that it must preserve
orthogonality. To show the ‚Äòif‚Äô half we can check that the map preserves lengths
of vectors because then for all ~p and ~q the distance between the two is preserved
kt(~p ‚àí ~q )k = kt(~p) ‚àí t(~q )k = k~p ‚àí ~q k. For that check let
!

t(~e1 ) =
t(~e2 ) =

and with the ‚Äòif‚Äô assumptions that a2 + b2 = c2 + d2 = 1 and ac + bd = 0 we
have this.
kt(~v )k2 = (ax + cy)2 + (bx + dy)2
= a2 x2 + 2acxy + c2 y2 + b2 x2 + 2bdxy + d2 y2
= x2 (a2 + b2 ) + y2 (c2 + d2 ) + 2xy(ac + bd)
= x2 + y2
= k~v k2
One thing that is neat about this characterization is that we can easily
recognize matrices that represent such a map with respect to the standard
bases: the columns are of length one and are mutually orthogonal. This is an
orthonormal matrix (or, more informally, orthogonal matrix since people

314

Chapter Three. Maps Between Spaces

often use this term to mean not just that the columns are orthogonal but also
that they have length one).
We can leverage this characterization to understand the geometric actions
of distance-preserving maps. Because kt(~v )k = k~v k, the map t sends any ~v
somewhere on the circle about the origin that has radius equal to the length of
~v. In particular, ~e1 and ~e2 map to the unit circle. What‚Äôs more, once we fix the
unit vector ~e1 as mapped to the vector with components a and b then there
are only two places where ~e2 can go if its image is to be perpendicular to the
first vector‚Äôs image: it can map either to one where ~e2 maintains its position a
quarter circle clockwise from ~e1

The geometric description of these two cases is easy. Let Œ∏ be the counterclockwise angle between the x-axis and the image of ~e1 . The first matrix above

radians.

(This picture shows ~e1 reflected up into the first quadrant and ~e2 reflected down
into the fourth quadrant.)
Note: in the domain the angle between ~e1 and ~e2 runs counterclockwise, and
in the first map above the angle from t(~e1 ) to t(~e2 ) is also counterclockwise,
so it preserves the orientation of the angle. But the second map reverses the
orientation. A distance-preserving map is direct if it preserves orientations and
opposite if it reverses orientation.
With that, we have characterized the Euclidean study of congruence. It
considers, for plane figures, the properties that are invariant under combinations
of (i) a rotation followed by a translation, or (ii) a reflection followed by a
translation (a reflection followed by a non-trivial translation is a glide reflection).
Another idea encountered in elementary geometry, besides congruence of
figures, is that figures are similar if they are congruent after a change of scale.
The two triangles below are similar since the second is the same shape as the
first but 3/2-ths the size.

Q3

From the above work we have that figures are similar if there is an orthonormal
matrix T such that the points ~q on one figure are the images of the points ~p on
the other figure by ~q = (kT )~v + ~p0 for some nonzero real number k and constant
vector ~p0 .
Although these ideas are from Euclid, mathematics is timeless and they are
still in use today. One application of the maps studied above is in computer
graphics. We can, for example, animate this top view of a cube by putting
together film frames of it rotating; that‚Äôs a rigid motion.

We could also make the cube appear to be moving away from us by producing
film frames of it shrinking, which gives us figures that are similar.

Computer graphics incorporates techniques from linear algebra in many other
ways (see Exercise 4).
A beautiful book that explores some of this area is [Weyl]. More on groups,
of transformations and otherwise, is in any book on Modern Algebra, for instance
[Birkhoff & MacLane]. More on Klein and the Erlanger Program is in [Yaglom].

Chapter Four

Determinants
In the first chapter we highlighted the special case of linear systems with the
same number of equations as unknowns, those of the form T~x = ~b where T is a
square matrix. We noted that there are only two kinds of T ‚Äôs. If T is associated
with a unique solution for any ~b, such as for the homogeneous system T~x = ~0,
then T is associated with a unique solution for every such ~b. We call such a
matrix nonsingular. The other kind of T , where every linear system for which it
is the matrix of coefficients has either no solution or infinitely many solutions,
we call singular.
In our work since then this distinction has been a theme. For instance, we
now know that an n√ón matrix T is nonsingular if and only if each of these holds:
‚Ä¢ any system T~x = ~b has a solution and that solution is unique;
‚Ä¢ Gauss-Jordan reduction of T yields an identity matrix;
‚Ä¢ the rows of T form a linearly independent set;
‚Ä¢ the columns of T form a linearly independent set, a basis for Rn ;
‚Ä¢ any map that T represents is an isomorphism;
‚Ä¢ an inverse matrix T ‚àí1 exists.
So when we look at a square matrix, one of the first things that we ask is whether
it is nonsingular.
This chapter develops a formula that determines whether T is nonsingular.
More precisely, we will develop a formula for 1√ó1 matrices, one for 2√ó2 matrices,
etc. These are naturally related; that is, we will develop a family of formulas, a
scheme that describes the formula for each size.
Since we will restrict the discussion to square matrices, in this chapter we
will often simply say ‚Äòmatrix‚Äô in place of ‚Äòsquare matrix‚Äô.

n the formula defines a determinant function detn√ón : Mn√ón ‚Üí R such that an
n√ón matrix T is nonsingular if and only if detn√ón (T ) 6= 0. (We usually omit
the subscript n√ón because the size of T describes which determinant function
we mean.)

I.1

Exploration

This subsection is an optional motivation and development of the general
definition. The definition is in the next subsection.
Above, in each case the matrix is nonsingular if and only if some formula is
nonzero. But the three formulas don‚Äôt show an obvious pattern. We may spot
that the 1√ó1 term a has one letter, that the 2√ó2 terms ad and bc have two
letters, and that the 3√ó3 terms each have three letters. We may even spot that
in those terms there is a letter from each row and column of the matrix, e.g., in
the cdh term one letter comes from each row and from each column.

Section I. Definition

A good strategy for solving problems is to explore which properties the
solution must have, and then search for something with those properties. So we
shall start by asking what properties we‚Äôd like the determinant formulas to have.
At this point, our main way to decide whether a matrix is singular or not is
to do Gaussian reduction and then check whether the diagonal of the echelon
form matrix has any zeroes, that is, whether the product down the diagonal
is zero. So we could guess that whatever determinant formula we find, the proof
that it is right may involve applying Gauss‚Äôs Method to the matrix to show that
in the end the product down the diagonal is zero if and only if our formula gives
zero.
This suggests a plan: we will look for a family of determinant formulas that
are unaffected by row operations and such that the determinant of an echelon
form matrix is the product of its diagonal entries. In the rest of this subsection
we will test this plan against the 2√ó2 and 3√ó3 formulas. In the end we will
have to modify the ‚Äúunaffected by row operations‚Äù part, but not by much.
First we check whether the 2√ó2 and 3√ó3 formulas are unaffected by the row
operation of combining: if
T

kœÅi +œÅj

‚àí‚Üí

TÃÇ

then is det(TÃÇ ) = det(T )? This check of the 2√ó2 determinant after the kœÅ1 + œÅ2
operation
a
det(
ka + c

!
b
) = a(kb + d) ‚àí (ka + c)b = ad ‚àí bc
kb + d

shows that it is indeed unchanged, and the other 2√ó2 combination kœÅ2 + œÅ1 gives
the same result. Likewise, the 3√ó3 combination kœÅ3 + œÅ2 leaves the determinant
unchanged

i
= aei + bfg + cdh ‚àí hfa ‚àí idb ‚àí gec

as do the other 3√ó3 row combination operations.
So there seems to be promise in the plan. Of course, perhaps if we had
worked out the 4√ó4 determinant formula and tested it then we might have found
that it is affected by row combinations. This is an exploration and we do not
yet have all the facts. Nonetheless, so far, so good.
Next we compare det(TÃÇ ) with det(T ) for row swaps. Here we hit a snag: the

2√ó2 row swap œÅ1 ‚Üî œÅ2 does not yield ad ‚àí bc.

Ô£¨
Ô£∑
det(Ô£≠a b cÔ£∏) = dbi + ecg + fah ‚àí hcd ‚àí iae ‚àí gbf

also gives a change of sign.
So row swaps appear in this experiment to change the sign of a determinant.
This does not wreck our plan entirely. We hope to decide nonsingularity by
considering only whether the formula gives zero, not by considering its sign.
Therefore, instead of expecting determinant formulas to be entirely unaffected
by row operations we modify our plan so that on a swap they will change sign.
Obviously we finish by comparing det(TÃÇ ) with det(T ) for the operation of
multiplying a row by a scalar. This
!
a
b
det(
) = a(kd) ‚àí (kc)b = k ¬∑ (ad ‚àí bc)

ends with the entire determinant multiplied by k, and the other 2√ó2 case has
the same result. This 3√ó3 case ends the same way

kg kh ki
= k ¬∑ (aei + bfg + cdh ‚àí hfa ‚àí idb ‚àí gec)
as do the other two 3√ó3 cases. These make us suspect that multiplying a row
by k multiplies the determinant by k. As before, this modifies our plan but does
not wreck it. We are asking only that the zero-ness of the determinant formula
be unchanged, not focusing on the its sign or magnitude.
So in this exploration our plan got modified in some inessential ways and is
now: we will look for n√ón determinant functions that remain unchanged under

Section I. Definition

the operation of row combination, that change sign on a row swap, that rescale
on the rescaling of a row, and such that the determinant of an echelon form
matrix is the product down the diagonal. In the next two subsections we will
see that for each n there is one and only one such function.
Finally, for the next subsection note that factoring out scalars is a row-wise
operation: here

the 3 comes only out of the top row only, leaving the other rows unchanged.
Consequently in the definition of determinant we will write it as a function of
the rows det(~œÅ1 , ~œÅ2 , . . . ~œÅn ), rather than as det(T ) or as a function of the entries
det(t1,1 , . . . , tn,n ).

Properties of Determinants

We want a formula to determine whether an n√ón matrix is nonsingular. We will
not begin by stating such a formula. Instead we will begin by considering, for

324

Chapter Four. Determinants

each n, the function that such a formula calculates. We will define this function
by a list of properties. We will then prove that a function with these properties
exists and is unique, and also describe how to compute it. (Because we will
eventually prove this, from the start we will just say ‚Äòdet(T )‚Äô instead of ‚Äòif there
is a unique determinant function then det(T )‚Äô.)
2.1 Definition A n√ón determinant is a function det : Mn√ón ‚Üí R such that
(1) det(~œÅ1 , . . . , k ¬∑ ~œÅi + ~œÅj , . . . , ~œÅn ) = det(~œÅ1 , . . . , ~œÅj , . . . , ~œÅn ) for i 6= j
(2) det(~œÅ1 , . . . , ~œÅj , . . . , ~œÅi , . . . , ~œÅn ) = ‚àí det(~œÅ1 , . . . , ~œÅi , . . . , ~œÅj , . . . , ~œÅn ) for i 6= j
(3) det(~œÅ1 , . . . , k~œÅi , . . . , ~œÅn ) = k ¬∑ det(~œÅ1 , . . . , ~œÅi , . . . , ~œÅn ) for any scalar k
(4) det(I) = 1 where I is an identity matrix
(the ~œÅ ‚Äôs are the rows of the matrix). We often write |T | for det(T ).
2.2 Remark Condition (2) is redundant since

‚àíœÅi

‚àí‚Üí ‚àí‚Üí TÃÇ

swaps rows i and j. We have listed it for consistency with the Gauss‚Äôs Method
presentation in earlier chapters.
2.3 Remark Condition (3) does not have a k 6= 0 restriction, although the Gauss‚Äôs
Method operation of multiplying a row by k does have it. The next result shows
that we do not need that restriction here.
2.4 Lemma A matrix with two identical rows has a determinant of zero. A matrix
with a zero row has a determinant of zero. A matrix is nonsingular if and only
if its determinant is nonzero. The determinant of an echelon form matrix is the
product down its diagonal.
Proof To verify the first sentence swap the two equal rows. The sign of the

determinant changes but the matrix is the same and so its determinant is the
same. Thus the determinant is zero.
For the second sentence multiply the zero row by two. That doubles the determinant but it also leaves the row unchanged, and hence leaves the determinant
unchanged. Thus the determinant must be zero.
Do Gauss-Jordan reduction for the third sentence, T ‚Üí ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚Üí TÃÇ . By the first
three properties the determinant of T is zero if and only if the determinant of TÃÇ is
zero (although the two could differ in sign or magnitude). A nonsingular matrix
T Gauss-Jordan reduces to an identity matrix and so has a nonzero determinant.

325

Section I. Definition

A singular T reduces to a TÃÇ with a zero row; by the second sentence of this
lemma its determinant is zero.
The fourth sentence has two cases. If the echelon form matrix is singular
then it has a zero row. Thus it has a zero on its diagonal and the product down
its diagonal is zero. By the third sentence of this result the determinant is zero
and therefore this matrix‚Äôs determinant equals the product down its diagonal.
If the echelon form matrix is nonsingular then none of its diagonal entries is
zero. This means that we can divide by those entries and use condition (3) to
get 1‚Äôs on the diagonal.

So in this case also, the determinant is the product down the diagonal.

QED

That gives us a way to compute the value of a determinant function on a
matrix: do Gaussian reduction, keeping track of any changes of sign caused by
row swaps and any scalars that we factor out, and finish by multiplying down
the diagonal of the echelon form result. This algorithm is as fast as Gauss‚Äôs
Method and so is practical on all of the matrices that we will see.

The prior example illustrates an important point. Although we have not yet
found a 4√ó4 determinant formula, if one exists then we know what value it gives
to the matrix ‚Äî if there is a function with properties (1) ‚Äì (4) then on the above
matrix the function must return 5.
2.7 Lemma For each n, if there is an n√ón determinant function then it is unique.
Proof Perform Gauss‚Äôs Method on the matrix, keeping track of how the sign

alternates on row swaps and any row-scaling factors, and then multiply down
the diagonal of the echelon form result. By the definition and the lemma, all
n√ón determinant functions must return this value on the matrix.
QED
The ‚Äòif there is an n√ón determinant function‚Äô emphasizes that, although we
can use Gauss‚Äôs Method to compute the only value that a determinant function
could possibly return, we haven‚Äôt yet shown that such a function exists for all n.
The rest of this section does that.

The Permutation Expansion

The prior subsection defines a function to be a determinant if it satisfies four
conditions and shows that there is at most one n√ón determinant function for
each n. What is left is to show that for each n such a function exists.
But, we easily compute determinants: we use Gauss‚Äôs Method, keeping track
of the sign changes from row swaps, and end by multiplying down the diagonal.
How could they not exist?
The difficulty is to show that the computation gives a well-defined ‚Äî that
is, unique ‚Äî result. Consider these two Gauss‚Äôs Method reductions of the same
matrix, the first without any row swap

Both yield the determinant ‚àí2 since in the second one we note that the row

Section I. Definition

The fact that we are able to proceed in two ways opens the possibility that the
two give different answers. That is, the way that we have given to compute
determinant values does not plainly eliminate the possibility that there might be,
say, two reductions of some 7√ó7 matrix that lead to different determinant values.
In that case we would not have a function, since the definition of a function is
that for each input there must be exactly associated one output. The rest of
this section shows that the definition Definition 2.1 never leads to a conflict.
To do this we will define an alternative way to find the value of a determinant.
(This alternative is less useful in practice because it is slow. But it is very useful
for theory.) The key idea is that condition (3) of Definition 2.1 shows that the
determinant function is not linear.
3.1 Example With condition (3) scalars come out of each row separately,
4 2
2 1
2 1
=2¬∑
=4¬∑
‚àí2 6
‚àí2 6
‚àí1 3
not from the entire matrix at once. So, where
!
2 1
A=
‚àí1 3
then det(2A) 6= 2 ¬∑ det(A) (instead, det(2A) = 4 ¬∑ det(A)).
Since scalars come out a row at a time we might guess that determinants are
linear a row at a time.
3.2 Definition Let V be a vector space. A map f : V n ‚Üí R is multilinear if
(1) f(~œÅ1 , . . . ,~v + w
~ , . . . , ~œÅn ) = f(~œÅ1 , . . . ,~v, . . . , ~œÅn ) + f(~œÅ1 , . . . , w
~ , . . . , ~œÅn )
(2) f(~œÅ1 , . . . , k~v, . . . , ~œÅn ) = k ¬∑ f(~œÅ1 , . . . ,~v, . . . , ~œÅn )
for ~v, w
~ ‚àà V and k ‚àà R.
3.3 Lemma Determinants are multilinear.
Proof Property (2) here is just Definition 2.1‚Äôs condition (3) so we need only
verify property (1).
There are two cases. If the set of other rows {~œÅ1 , . . . , ~œÅi‚àí1 , ~œÅi+1 , . . . , ~œÅn }
is linearly dependent then all three matrices are singular and so all three
determinants are zero and the equality is trivial.
Therefore assume that the set of other rows is linearly independent. We can
~ ~œÅi+1 , . . . , ~œÅn i. Express
make a basis by adding one more vector h~œÅ1 , . . . , ~œÅi‚àí1 , Œ≤,

Consider the left side of (1) and expand ~v + w
~.
~ + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (vn + wn )~œÅn , . . . , ~œÅn ) (‚àó)
det(~œÅ1 , . . . , (v1 + w1 )~œÅ1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (vi + wi )Œ≤
By the definition of determinant‚Äôs condition (1), the value of (‚àó) is unchanged
by the operation of adding ‚àí(v1 + w1 )~œÅ1 to the i-th row ~v + w
~ . The i-th row
becomes this.
~ + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (vn + wn )~œÅn
~v + w
~ ‚àí (v1 + w1 )~œÅ1 = (v2 + w2 )~œÅ2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + (vi + wi )Œ≤
Next add ‚àí(v2 + w2 )~œÅ2 , etc., to eliminate all of the terms from the other rows.
Apply condition (3) from the definition of determinant.
det(~œÅ1 , . . . ,~v + w
~ , . . . , ~œÅn )
~ . . . , ~œÅn )
= det(~œÅ1 , . . . , (vi + wi ) ¬∑ Œ≤,

~ . . . , ~œÅn ) + wi ¬∑ det(~œÅ1 , . . . , Œ≤,
~ . . . , ~œÅn )
= vi ¬∑ det(~œÅ1 , . . . , Œ≤,
Now this is a sum of two determinants. To finish, bring vi and wi back inside
~ and use row combinations again, this time to reconstruct the
in front of the Œ≤‚Äôs
expressions of ~v and w
~ in terms of the basis. That is, start with the operations
~
of adding v1~œÅ1 to vi Œ≤ and w1~œÅ1 to wi~œÅ1 , etc., to get the expansions of ~v and w
~.

Multilinearity allows us to expand a determinant into a sum of determinants,
each of which involves a simple matrix.

The result is four determinants. In each row of each of the four there is a single
entry from the original matrix.

331

Section I. Definition

3.5 Example In the same way, a 3√ó3 determinant separates into a sum of many
simpler determinants. Splitting along the first row produces three determinants
(we have highlighted the zero in the 1, 3 position to set it off visually from the
zeroes that appear as part of the splitting).

In turn, each of the above splits in three along the second row. Then each of the
nine splits in three along the third row. The result is twenty seven determinants,
such that each row contains a single entry from the starting matrix.

So multilinearity will expand an n√ón determinant into a sum of nn -many
determinants, where each row of each determinant contains a single entry from
the starting matrix.
In this expansion, although there are lots of terms, most of them have a
determinant of zero.
3.6 Example In each of these examples from the prior expansion, two of the
entries from the original matrix are in the same column.

For instance, in the first matrix the 2 and the 4 both come from the first column
of the original matrix. In the second matrix the ‚àí1 and 5 both come from the
third column. And in the third matrix the 0 and 5 both come from the third
column. Any such matrix is singular because one row is a multiple of the other.
Thus any such determinant is zero, by Lemma 2.4.
With that observation the above expansion of the 3√ó3 determinant into the
sum of the twenty seven determinants simplifies to the sum of these six where

332

the entries from the original matrix come one per row, and also one per column.

To finish, evaluate those six determinants by row-swapping them to the identity
matrix, keeping track of the sign changes.

+ 20 ¬∑ (‚àí1) + 0 ¬∑ (+1)
‚àí 4 ¬∑ (+1) ‚àí 6 ¬∑ (‚àí1) = 12
That example captures this subsection‚Äôs new calculation scheme. Multilinearity expands a determinant into many separate determinants, each with
one entry from the original matrix per row. Most of these have one row that
is a multiple of another so we omit them. We are left with the determinants
that have one entry per row and column from the original matrix. Factoring
out the scalars further reduces the determinants that we must compute to the
one-entry-per-row-and-column matrices where all entries are 1‚Äôs.
Recall Definition Three.IV.3.14, that a permutation matrix is square, with
entries 0‚Äôs except for a single 1 in each row and column. We now introduce a
notation for permutation matrices.

333

Section I. Definition

3.7 Definition An n-permutation is a function on the first n positive integers
œÜ : { 1, . . . , n} ‚Üí {1, . . . , n} that is one-to-one and onto.
In a permutation each number 1, . . . , n appears as output for one and only one
input. We can denote a permutation as a sequence œÜ = hœÜ(1), œÜ(2), . . . , œÜ(n)i.
3.8 Example The 2-permutations are the functions œÜ1 : {1, 2 } ‚Üí {1, 2 } given by
œÜ1 (1) = 1, œÜ1 (2) = 2, and œÜ2 : { 1, 2 } ‚Üí {1, 2 } given by œÜ2 (1) = 2, œÜ2 (2) = 1.
The sequence notation is shorter: œÜ1 = h1, 2i and œÜ2 = h2, 1i.
3.9 Example In the sequence notation the 3-permutations are œÜ1 = h1, 2, 3i,
œÜ2 = h1, 3, 2i, œÜ3 = h2, 1, 3i, œÜ4 = h2, 3, 1i, œÜ5 = h3, 1, 2i, and œÜ6 = h3, 2, 1i.
We denote the row vector that is all 0‚Äôs except for a 1 in entry j with Œπj so
that the four-wide Œπ2 is (0 1 0 0). Now our notation for permutation matrices
is: with any œÜ = hœÜ(1), . . . , œÜ(n)i associate the matrix whose rows are ŒπœÜ(1) ,
. . . , ŒπœÜ(n) . For instance, associated with the 4-permutation œÜ = h3, 2, 1, 4i is the
matrix whose rows are the corresponding Œπ‚Äôs.

Computing a determinant with the permutation expansion typically takes
longer than with Gauss‚Äôs Method. However, we will use it to prove that the
determinant function is well-defined. We will just state the result here and defer
its proof to the following subsection.
3.14 Theorem For each n there is an n√ón determinant function.
Also in the next subsection is the proof of the result below (they are together
because the two proofs overlap).
3.15 Theorem The determinant of a matrix equals the determinant of its transpose.
Because of this theorem, while we have so far stated determinant results in
terms of rows, all of the results also hold in terms of columns.

335

Section I. Definition

3.16 Corollary A matrix with two equal columns is singular. Column swaps
change the sign of a determinant. Determinants are multilinear in their columns.
Proof For the first statement, transposing the matrix results in a matrix with

the same determinant, and with two equal rows, and hence a determinant of
zero. Prove the other two in the same way.

We finish this subsection with a summary: determinant functions exist, are
unique, and we know how to compute them. As for what determinants are
about, perhaps these lines [Kemp] help make it memorable.

This subsection contains proofs of two results from the prior subsection.
It is optional. We will use the material developed here only in the Jordan
Canonical Form subsection, which is also optional.
We wish to show that for any size n, the determinant function on n√ón matrices
is well-defined. The prior subsection develops the permutation expansion formula.

This reduces the problem of showing that the determinant is well-defined to only
showing that the determinant is well-defined on the set of permutation matrices.
A permutation matrix can be row-swapped to the identity matrix. So one
way that we can calculate its determinant is by keeping track of the number of
swaps. However, we still must show that the result is well-defined. Recall what
the difficulty is: the determinant of

Section I. Definition

we would have the determinant giving two different outputs from a single input.
Below, Corollary 4.5 proves that this cannot happen ‚Äî there is no permutation
matrix that can be row-swapped to an identity matrix in two ways, one with an
even number of swaps and the other with an odd number of swaps.
4.1 Definition In a permutation œÜ = h. . . , k, . . . , j, . . .i, elements such that k > j
are in an inversion of their natural order. Similarly, in a permutation matrix

then since inversions involving rows not in this pair are not affected, the swap
changes the total number of inversions by one, either removing or producing one
inversion depending on whether œÜ(j) > œÜ(k) or not. Consequently, the total
number of inversions changes from odd to even or from even to odd.

Each of these adjacent swaps changes the number of inversions from odd to even
or from even to odd. The total number of swaps (k ‚àí j) + (k ‚àí j ‚àí 1) is odd.
Thus, in aggregate, the number of inversions changes from even to odd, or from
odd to even.
QED
4.5 Corollary If a permutation matrix has an odd number of inversions then
swapping it to the identity takes an odd number of swaps. If it has an even
number of inversions then swapping to the identity takes an even number.
Proof The identity matrix has zero inversions. To change an odd number to

zero requires an odd number of swaps, and to change an even number to zero
requires an even number of swaps.
QED
4.6 Example The matrix in Example 4.3 can be brought to the identity with one
swap œÅ1 ‚Üî œÅ3 . (So the number of swaps needn‚Äôt be the same as the number of
inversions, but the oddness or evenness of the two numbers is the same.)

341

Section I. Definition

4.7 Definition The signum of a permutation sgn(œÜ) is ‚àí1 if the number of
inversions in œÜ is odd and is +1 if the number of inversions is even.
4.8 Example Using the notation
have

so sgn(œÜ1 ) = 1 because there are no inversions, while sgn(œÜ2 ) = ‚àí1 because
there is one.
We still have not shown that the determinant function is well-defined because
we have not considered row operations on permutation matrices other than row
swaps. We will finesse this issue. Define a function d : Mn√ón ‚Üí R by altering
the permutation expansion formula, replacing |PœÜ | with sgn(œÜ).
X
d(T ) =
t1,œÜ(1) t2,œÜ(2) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ tn,œÜ(n) ¬∑ sgn(œÜ)
permutations œÜ

The advantage of this formula is that the number of inversions is clearly welldefined ‚Äî just count them. Therefore, we will be finished showing that an n√ón
determinant function exists when we show that this d satisfies the conditions
required of a determinant.
4.9 Lemma The function d above is a determinant. Hence determinants exist
for every n.
Proof We must check that it has the four conditions from the definition of

determinant, Definition 2.1.
Condition (4) is easy: where I is the n√ón identity, in
X
d(I) =
Œπ1,œÜ(1) Œπ2,œÜ(2) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Œπn,œÜ(n) sgn(œÜ)

all of the terms in the summation are zero except for the one where the permutation œÜ is the identity, which gives the product down the diagonal, which is
one.

That is, the term with hatted t‚Äôs is associated with this term from the d(T )
expansion: t1,œÉ(1) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ tj,œÉ(j) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ti,œÉ(i) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ tn,œÉ(n) sgn(œÉ), where the permutation
œÉ equals œÜ but with the i-th and j-th numbers interchanged, œÉ(i) = œÜ(j) and
œÉ(j) = œÜ(i). The two terms have the same multiplicands tÃÇ1,œÜ(1) = t1,œÉ(1) ,
. . . , including the entries from the swapped rows tÃÇi,œÜ(i) = tj,œÜ(i) = tj,œÉ(j) and
tÃÇj,œÜ(j) = ti,œÜ(j) = ti,œÉ(i) . But the two terms are negatives of each other since
sgn(œÜ) = ‚àí sgn(œÉ) by Lemma 4.4.
Now, any permutation œÜ can be derived from some other permutation œÉ by
such a swap, in one and only one way. Therefore the summation in (‚àó) is in fact
a sum over all permutations, taken once and only once.

of a matrix S that is equal to T except that row j of S is a copy of row i of T ,
that is, S has two equal rows. In the same way that we proved Lemma 2.4 we
can see that d(S) = 0: a swap of S‚Äôs equal rows will change the sign of d(S)
but since the matrix is unchanged by that swap the value of d(S) must also be
unchanged, and so that value must be zero.
QED
We have now proved that determinant functions exist for each size n√ón. We
already know that for each size there is at most one determinant. Therefore, for
each size there is one and only one determinant function.
We end this subsection by proving the other result remaining from the prior
subsection.
4.10 Theorem The determinant of a matrix equals the determinant of its transpose.
Proof The proof is best understood by doing the general 3√ó3 case. That the

argument applies to the n√ón case will be clear.

Compare first the six products of t‚Äôs. The ones in the expansion of T are the
same as the ones in the expansion of the transpose; for instance, t1,2 t2,3 t3,1 is
in the top and t3,1 t1,2 t2,3 is in the bottom. That‚Äôs perfectly sensible ‚Äî the six
in the top arise from all of the ways of picking one entry of T from each row and
column while the six in the bottom are all of the ways of picking one entry of T
from each column and row, so of course they are the same set.
Next observe that in the two expansions, each t-product expression is not
necessarily associated with the same permutation matrix. For instance, on the
top t1,2 t2,3 t3,1 is associated with the matrix for the map 1 7‚Üí 2, 2 7‚Üí 3, 3 7‚Üí 1.
On the bottom t3,1 t1,2 t2,3 is associated with the matrix for the map 1 7‚Üí 3,
2 7‚Üí 1, 3 7‚Üí 2. The second map is inverse to the first. This is also perfectly
sensible ‚Äî both the matrix transpose and the map inverse flip the 1, 2 to 2, 1,
flip the 2, 3 to 3, 2, and flip 3, 1 to 1, 3.
We finish by noting that the determinant of PœÜ equals the determinant of
PœÜ‚àí1 , as Exercise 16shows.

Geometry of Determinants

The prior section develops the determinant algebraically, by considering formulas
satisfying certain conditions. This section complements that with a geometric
approach. Beyond its intuitive appeal, an advantage of this approach is that
while we have so far only considered whether or not a determinant is zero, here
we shall give a meaning to the value of the determinant. (The prior section
treats the determinant as a function of the rows but this section focuses on
columns.)

1.1 Definition In Rn the box (or parallelepiped) formed by h~v1 , . . . ,~vn i is the
set {t1~v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + tn~vn | t1 , . . . , tn ‚àà [0 . . . 1] }.

Thus the parallelogram above is the box formed by h yx11 , yx22 i. A three-space
box is shown in Example 1.4.
We can find the area of the above box by drawing an enclosing rectangle and
subtracting away areas not in the box.

is no coincidence. The definition of determinants contains four properties that
we know lead to a unique function for each dimension n. We shall argue that
these properties make good postulates for a function that measure the size of
boxes in n-space.
For instance, a function that measures the size of the box should have the
property that multiplying one of the box-defining vectors by a scalar will multiply
the size by that scalar.
w
~

w
~
~
v

k~
v

Shown here is k = 1.4. On the right the rescaled region is in solid lines with the
original region shaded for comparison.
That is, we can reasonably expect that size(. . . , k~v, . . . ) = k ¬∑ size(. . . ,~v, . . . ).
Of course, this condition is one of those in the definition of determinants.
Another property of determinants that should apply to any function measuring the size of a box is that it is unaffected by row combinations. Here are
before-combining and after-combining boxes (the scalar shown is k = ‚àí0.35).
k~
v+w
~

w
~
~
v

~
v

The box formed by v and k~v + w
~ slants differently than the original one but
the two have the same base and the same height, and hence the same area. So
we expect that size is not affected by a shear operation size(. . . ,~v, . . . , w
~ ,...) =
size(. . . ,~v, . . . , k~v + w
~ , . . . ). Again, this is a determinant condition.
We expect that the box formed by unit vectors has unit size
~
e2
~
e1

and we naturally extend that to any n-space size(~e1 , . . . , ~en ) = 1.
Condition (2) of the definition of determinant is redundant, as remarked
following the definition. We know from the prior section that for each n the
determinant exists and is unique so we know that these postulates for size
functions are consistent and that we do not need any more postulates. Therefore,
we are justified in interpreting det(~v1 , . . . ,~vn ) as giving the size of the box
formed by the vectors.
1.2 Remark Although condition (2) is redundant it raises an important point.
Consider these two.

Swapping the columns changes the sign. On the left, starting with ~u and
following the arc inside the angle to ~v (that is, going counterclockwise), we get
a positive size. On the right, starting at ~v and going to ~u, and so following
the clockwise arc, gives a negative size. The sign returned by the size function
reflects the orientation or sense of the box. (We see the same thing if we
picture the effect of scalar multiplication by a negative scalar.)
1.3 Definition The volume of a box is the absolute value of the determinant of a
matrix with those vectors as columns.
1.4 Example By the formula that takes the area of the base times the height, the
volume of this parallelepiped is 12. That agrees with the determinant.

1.5 Theorem A transformation t : Rn ‚Üí Rn changes the size of all boxes by the
same factor, namely, the size of the image of a box |t(S)| is |T | times the size of
the box |S|, where T is the matrix representing t with respect to the standard
basis.
That is, the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants
|T S| = |T | ¬∑ |S|.
The two sentences say the same thing, first in map terms and then in matrix
terms. This is because |t(S)| = |T S|, as both give the size of the box that is

349

Section II. Geometry of Determinants

the image of the unit box En under the composition t ‚ó¶ s, where the maps
are represented with respect to the standard basis. We will prove the second
sentence.
Proof First consider the case that T is singular and thus does not have an

inverse. Observe that if T S is invertible then there is an M such that (T S)M = I,
so T (SM) = I, and so T is invertible. The contrapositive of that observation is
that if T is not invertible then neither is T S ‚Äî if |T | = 0 then |T S| = 0.
Now consider the case that T is nonsingular. Any nonsingular matrix factors
into a product of elementary matrices T = E1 E2 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Er . To finish this argument
we will verify that |ES| = |E| ¬∑ |S| for all matrices S and elementary matrices E.
The result will then follow because |T S| = |E1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Er S| = |E1 | ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ |Er | ¬∑ |S| =
|E1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Er | ¬∑ |S| = |T | ¬∑ |S|.
There are three types of elementary matrix. We will cover the Mi (k) case;
the Pi,j and Ci,j (k) checks are similar. The matrix Mi (k)S equals S except that
row i is multiplied by k. The third condition of determinant functions then
gives that |Mi (k)S| = k ¬∑ |S|. But |Mi (k)| = k, again by the third condition
because Mi (k) is derived from the identity by multiplication of row i by k. Thus
|ES| = |E| ¬∑ |S| holds for E = Mi (k).

while only increasing its surface area by an amount proportional to a factor of c2
is the Square-cube law [Wikipedia, Square-cube Law].)

Section III. Laplace‚Äôs Formula

The formulas from this subsection are often used for by-hand calculation
and are sometimes useful with special types of matrices. However, for generic
matrices they are not the best choice because they require more arithmetic than,
for instance, the Gauss-Jordan method.

Cramer‚Äôs Rule lets us by-eye solve systems that are small and simple. For
example, we can solve systems with two equations and two unknowns, or three
equations and three unknowns, where the numbers are small integers. Such
cases appear often enough that many people find this formula handy.
But using it to solving large or complex systems is not practical, either by
hand or by a computer. A Gauss‚Äôs Method-based approach is faster.

Topic
Speed of Calculating Determinants
For large matrices, finding the determinant by using row operations is typically
much faster than using the permutation expansion. We make this statement
precise by finding how many operations each method performs.
To compare the speed of two algorithms, we find for each one how the time
taken grows as the size of its input data set grows. For instance, if we increase
the size of the input by a factor of ten does the time taken grow by a factor of
ten, or by a factor of a hundred, or by a factor of a thousand? That is, is the
time taken proportional to the size of the data set, or to the square of that size,
or to the cube of that size, etc.? An algorithm whose time is proportional to the
square is faster than one that takes time proportional to the cube.
First consider the permutation expansion formula.

There are n! = n ¬∑ (n ‚àí 1) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ 2 ¬∑ 1 different n-permutations so for a matrix with
n rows this sum has n! terms (and inside each term is n-many multiplications).
The factorial function grows quickly: when n is only 10 the expansion already
has 10! = 3, 628, 800 terms. Observe that growth proportional to the factorial is
bigger than growth proportional to the square n! > n2 because multiplying the
first two factors in n! gives n ¬∑ (n ‚àí 1), which for large n is approximately n2 and
then multiplying in more factors will make the factorial even larger. Similarly,
the factorial function grows faster than n3 , etc. So an algorithm that uses the
permutation expansion formula, and thus performs a number of operations at
least as large as the factorial of the number of rows, would be very slow.
In contrast, the time taken by the row reduction method does not grow
so fast. Below is a script for row reduction in the computer language Python.
(Note: The code here is naive; for example it does not handle the case that the

the tests and subcases is messier but would gives us roughly the same speed
results.)

involves operating on every entry in that row. That is a triply-nested loop. So
this program has a running time that is something like the cube of the number of
rows in the matrix. (Comment. We are glossing over many issues. For example,
we may worry that the time taken by the program is dominated by the time
to store and retrieve entries from memory, rather than by the row operations.
However, development of a computation model is outside of our scope.)
If we add this code at the bottom,
def do_matrix(num_rows):

for num_rows in [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100]:

t = timeit.timeit(stmt=s, setup="from __main__ import do_matrix",

Finding the fastest algorithm to compute the determinant is a topic of current
research. So far, researchers have found algorithms that run in time between
the square and cube of the number of rows.
The contrast between the times taken by the two determinant computation
methods of permutation expansion and row operations makes the point that
although in principle they give the same answer, in practice we want the one
with the best performance.

Exercises
1 To get an idea of what happens for typical matrices we can use the ability of
computer systems to generate random numbers (of course, these are only pseudorandom in that they come from an algorithm but they pass a number of reasonable
statistical tests for randomness).
(a) Fill a 5√ó5 array with random numbers say, in the range [0 . . . 1)). See if it is
singular. Repeat that experiment a few times. Are singular matrices frequent or
rare in this sense?
(b) Time your computer algebra system at finding the determinant of ten 10√ó10
arrays of random numbers. Find the average time per array. Repeat the prior
item for 20√ó20 arrays, 30√ó30 arrays, . . . 100√ó100 arrays, and compare to the
numbers given above. (Notice that, when an array is singular, we can sometimes
decide that quickly, for instance if the first row equals the second. In the light of
your answer to the first part, do you expect that singular systems play a large
role in your average?)
(c) Graph the input size versus the average time.

above.

Count the number of multiplications and divisions used in each case, for each of

3 The use by the timing routine of do_matrix has a bug. That routine does
two things, generate a random matrix and then do gauss_method on it, and the
timing number returned is for the combination. Produce code that times only the
gauss_method routine.
4 What 10√ó10 array can you invent that takes your computer the longest time to
reduce? The shortest?
5 Some computer language specifications requires that arrays be stored ‚Äúby column,‚Äù
that is, the entire first column is stored contiguously, then the second column, etc.
Does the code fragment given take advantage of this, or can it be rewritten to
make it faster, by taking advantage of the fact that computer fetches are faster
from contiguous locations?

This all-integer approach is easier for mental calculations. And, using integer
arithmetic on a computer avoids some sticky issues involving floating point
calculations [Kahan]. So there are sound reasons for this approach.
Another advantage of this approach is that we can easily apply Laplace‚Äôs expansion to the first column of (‚àó‚àó) and then get the determinant by remembering
to divide by 4 because of (‚àó).
Here is the general 3√ó3 case of this approach to finding the determinant.

Let C be the 1, 1 minor. By Laplace the determinant of the above matrix is
a1,1 det(C). We thus have a21,1 det(A) = a1,1 det(C) and since a1,1 6= 0 this
gives det(A) = det(C)/a1,1 .
To do larger matrices we must see how to compute the minor‚Äôs entries. The
pattern above is that each element of the minor is a 2 √ó 2 determinant. For
instance, the entry in the minor‚Äôs upper left a2,2 a1,1 ‚àí a2,1 a1,2 , which is the
2, 2 entry in the above matrix, is the determinant of the matrix of these four
elements of A.

Chapter Four. Determinants

The formula for 3√ó3 matrices det(A) = det(C)/a1,1 gives det(A) = (50/2) = 25.
For a larger determinant we must do multiple steps but each involves only
2√ó2 determinants. So we can often calculate the determinant just by writing
down a bit of intermediate information. For instance, with this 4√ó4 matrix

Laplace‚Äôs expansion formula reduces the calculation of an n√ón determinant
to the evaluation of a number of (n ‚àí 1) √ó (n ‚àí 1) ones. Chi√≤‚Äôs formula is
also recursive but it reduces an n√ón determinant to a single (n ‚àí 1)√ó(n ‚àí 1)
determinant, calculated from a number of 2√ó2 determinants. However, for large
matrices Gauss‚Äôs Method is better than either of these; for instance, it takes
roughly half as many operations as Chi√≤‚Äôs Method [Fuller & Logan].

Projective Geometry
There are geometries other than the familiar Euclidean one. One such geometry
arose when artists observed that what a viewer sees is not necessarily what is
there. As an example, here is Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs The Last Supper.

Look at where the ceiling meets the left and right walls. In the room those lines
are parallel but da Vinci has painted lines that, if extended, would intersect.
The intersection is the vanishing point. This aspect of perspective is familiar
as an image of railroad tracks that appear to converge at the horizon.
Da Vinci has adopted a model of how we see. Imagine a person viewing a
room. From the person‚Äôs eye, in every direction, carry a ray outward until it
intersects something, such as a point on the line where the wall meets the ceiling.
This first intersection point is what the person sees in that direction. Overall
what the person sees is the collection of three-dimensional intersection points
projected to a common two dimensional image.

Topic: Projective Geometry

This is a central projection from a single point. As the sketch shows, this
projection is not orthogonal like the ones we have seen earlier because the line
from the viewer to C is not orthogonal to the image plane. (This model is only
an approximation ‚Äî it does not take into account such factors as that we have
binocular vision or that our brain‚Äôs processing greatly affects what we perceive.
Nonetheless the model is interesting, both artistically and mathematically.)
The operation of central projection preserves some geometric properties, for
instance lines project to lines. However, it fails to preserve some others. One
example is that equal length segments can project to segments of unequal length
(above, AB is longer than BC because the segment projected to AB is closer to
the viewer and closer things look bigger). The study of the effects of central
projections is projective geometry.
There are three cases of central projection. The first is the projection done
by a movie projector.

projector P

source S

image I

We can think that each source point is pushed from the domain plane S outward
to the image plane I. The second case of projection is that of the artist pulling
the source back to a canvas.

painter P

image I

source S

The two are different because first S is in the middle and then I. One more
configuration can happen, with P in the middle. An example of this is when we
use a pinhole to shine the image of a solar eclipse onto a paper.

372

Chapter Four. Determinants

image I

pinhole P

source S

Although the three are not exactly the same, they are similar. We shall say
that each is a central projection by P of S to I. We next look at three models of
central projection, of increasing abstractness but also of increasing uniformity.
The last model will bring out the linear algebra.
Consider again the effect of railroad tracks that appear to converge to a point.
Model this with parallel lines in a domain plane S and a projection via a P to
a codomain plane I. (The gray lines shown are parallel to the S plane and to
the I plane.)

S
P

I

This single setting shows all three projection cases. The first picture below shows
P acting as a movie projector by pushing points from part of S out to image
points on the lower half of I. The middle picture shows P acting as the artist by
pulling points from another part of S back to image points in the middle of I.
In the third picture P acts as the pinhole, projecting points from S to the upper
part of I. This third picture is the trickiest ‚Äî the points that are projected near
to the vanishing point are the ones that are far out on the lower left of S. Points
in S that are near to the vertical gray line are sent high up on I.

There are two awkward things here. First, neither of the two points in the
domain nearest to the vertical gray line (see below) has an image because a
projection from those two is along the gray line that is parallel to the codomain
plane (we say that these two are projected to infinity). The second is that the
vanishing point in I isn‚Äôt the image of any point from S because a projection to
this point would be along the gray line that is parallel to the domain plane (we
say that the vanishing point is the image of a projection from infinity).

For a model that eliminates this awkwardness, cover the projector P with
a hemispheric dome. In any direction, defined by a line through the origin,
project anything in that direction to the single spot on the dome where the line
intersects. This includes projecting things on the line between P and the dome,
as with the movie projector. It includes projecting things on the line further
from P than the dome, as with the painter. More subtly, it also includes things
on the line that lie behind P, as with the pinhole case.

More formally, for any nonzero vector ~v ‚àà R3 , let the associated point v in the
projective plane be the set {k~v | k ‚àà R and k 6= 0 } of nonzero vectors lying on
the same line through the origin as ~v. To describe a projective point we can give
any representative member of the line, so that the projective point shown above
can be represented in any of these three ways.

Chapter Four. Determinants

This picture and definition clarifies central projection but there is still
something ungainly about the dome model: what happens when P looks down?
Consider, in the sketch above, the part of P‚Äôs line of sight that comes up towards
us, out of the page. Imagine that this part of the line falls, to the equator and
below. Now the part of the line ` that intersects the dome lies behind the page.
That is, as the line of sight continues down past the equator, the projective
point suddenly shifts from the front of the dome to the back of the dome. (This
brings out that the dome does not include the entire equator or else when the
viewer is looking exactly along the equator then there would be two points in the
line that are both on the dome. Instead we define the dome so that it includes
the points on the equator with a positive y coordinate, as well as the point
where y = 0 and x is positive.) This discontinuity means that we often have to
treat equatorial points as a separate case. So while the railroad track model of
central projection has three cases, the dome has two.
We can do better, we can reduce to a model having a single case. Consider a
sphere centered at the origin. Any line through the origin intersects the sphere
in two spots, said to be antipodal. Because we associate each line through
the origin with a point in the projective plane, we can draw such a point as a
pair of antipodal spots on the sphere. Below, we show the two antipodal spots
connected by a dashed line to emphasize that they are not two different points,
the pair of spots together make one projective point.

While drawing a point as a pair of antipodal spots on the sphere is not as intuitive
as the one-spot-per-point dome mode, on the other hand the awkwardness of
the dome model is gone in that as a line of view slides from north to south, no
sudden changes happen. This central projection model is uniform.
So far we have described points in projective geometry. What about lines?
What a viewer P at the origin sees as a line is shown below as a great circle, the
intersection of the model sphere with a plane through the origin.

375

Topic: Projective Geometry

(We‚Äôve included one of the projective points on this line to bring out a subtlety.
Because two antipodal spots together make up a single projective point, the
great circle‚Äôs behind-the-paper part is the same set of projective points as its
in-front-of-the-paper part.) Just as we did with each projective point, we can
also describe a projective line with a triple of reals. For instance, the members
of this plane through the origin in R3
Ô£´ Ô£∂
x
Ô£¨ Ô£∑
{ Ô£≠yÔ£∏ | x + y ‚àí z = 0 }
z
project to a line that we can describe with (1 1 ‚àí1) (using a row vector for
this typographically distinguishes lines from points). In general, for any nonzero
three-wide row vector ~L we define the associated line in the projective plane,
to be the set L = { k~L | k ‚àà R and k 6= 0 }.
The reason this description of a line as a triple is convenient is that in
the projective plane a point v and a line L are incident ‚Äî the point lies on
the line, the line passes through the point ‚Äî if and only if a dot product of
their representatives v1 L1 + v2 L2 + v3 L3 is zero (Exercise 4 shows that this is
independent of the choice of representatives ~v and ~L). For instance, the projective
point described above by the column vector with components 1, 2, and 3 lies
in the projective line described by (1 1 ‚àí1), simply because any vector in R3
whose components are in ratio 1 : 2 : 3 lies in the plane through the origin whose
equation is of the form k ¬∑ x + k ¬∑ y ‚àí k ¬∑ z = 0 for any nonzero k. That is, the
incidence formula is inherited from the three-space lines and planes of which v
and L are projections.
With this, we can do analytic projective geometry. For instance, the projective
line L = (1 1 ‚àí1) has the equation 1v1 + 1v2 ‚àí 1v3 = 0, meaning that for any
projective point v incident with the line, any of v‚Äôs representative homogeneous
coordinate vectors will satisfy the equation. This is true simply because those
vectors lie on the three space plane. One difference from Euclidean analytic
geometry is that in projective geometry besides talking about the equation of a
line, we also talk about the equation of a point. For the fixed point
Ô£´ Ô£∂
1
Ô£¨ Ô£∑
v = Ô£≠2 Ô£∏

the property that characterizes lines incident on this point is that the components
of any representatives satisfy 1L1 + 2L2 + 3L3 = 0 and so this is the equation of
v.

376

Chapter Four. Determinants

This symmetry of the statements about lines and points is the Duality
Principle of projective geometry: in any true statement, interchanging ‚Äòpoint‚Äô
with ‚Äòline‚Äô results in another true statement. For example, just as two distinct
points determine one and only one line, in the projective plane two distinct lines
determine one and only one point. Here is a picture showing two projective lines
that cross in antipodal spots and thus cross at one projective point.

(‚àó)

Contrast this with Euclidean geometry, where two unequal lines may have a
unique intersection or may be parallel. In this way, projective geometry is
simpler, more uniform, than Euclidean geometry.
That simplicity is relevant because there is a relationship between the two
spaces: we can view the projective plane as an extension of the Euclidean plane.
Draw the sphere model of the projective plane as the unit sphere in R3 . Take
Euclidean 2-space to be the plane z = 1. As shown below, all of the points on the
Euclidean plane are projections of antipodal spots from the sphere. Conversely,
we can view some points in the projective plane as corresponding to points in
Euclidean space. (Note that projective points on the equator don‚Äôt correspond
to points on the plane; instead we say these project out to infinity.)

(‚àó‚àó)

Thus we can think of projective space as consisting of the Euclidean plane with
some extra points adjoined ‚Äî the Euclidean plane is embedded in the projective
plane. The extra points in projective space, the equatorial points, are called
ideal points or points at infinity and the equator is called the ideal line or
line at infinity (it is not a Euclidean line, it is a projective line).
The advantage of this extension from the Euclidean plane to the projective
plane is that some of the nonuniformity of Euclidean geometry disappears. For
instance, the projective lines shown above in (‚àó) cross at antipodal spots, a
single projective point, on the sphere‚Äôs equator. If we put those lines into (‚àó‚àó)
then they correspond to Euclidean lines that are parallel. That is, in moving

377

Topic: Projective Geometry

from the Euclidean plane to the projective plane, we move from having two
cases, that distinct lines either intersect or are parallel, to having only one case,
that distinct lines intersect (possibly at a point at infinity).
A disadvantage of the projective plane is that we don‚Äôt have the same
familiarity with it as we have with the Euclidean plane. Doing analytic geometry
in the projective plane helps because the equations lead us to the right conclusions.
Analytic projective geometry uses linear algebra. For instance, for three points
of the projective plane t, u, and v, setting up the equations for those points by
fixing vectors representing each shows that the three are collinear if and only
if the resulting three-equation system has infinitely many row vector solutions
representing their line. That in turn holds if and only if this determinant is zero.

Thus, three points in the projective plane are collinear if and only if any three
representative column vectors are linearly dependent. Similarly, by duality, three
lines in the projective plane are incident on a single point if and only if any
three row vectors representing them are linearly dependent.
The following result is more evidence of the niceness of the geometry of
the projective plane. These two triangles are in perspective from the point O
because their corresponding vertices are collinear.

Consider the pairs of corresponding sides: the sides T1 U1 and T2 U2 , the sides
T1 V1 and T2 V2 , and the sides U1 V1 and U2 V2 . Desargue‚Äôs Theorem is that
when we extend the three pairs of corresponding sides, they intersect (shown
here as the points T U, T V, and UV). What‚Äôs more, those three intersection
points are collinear.

Chapter Four. Determinants

We will prove this using projective geometry. (We‚Äôve drawn Euclidean figures
because that is the more familiar image. To consider them as projective figures
we can imagine that, although the line segments shown are parts of great circles
and so are curved, the model has such a large radius compared to the size of the
figures that the sides appear in our sketch to be straight.)
For the proof we need a preliminary lemma [Coxeter]: if W, X, Y, Z are four
points in the projective plane, no three of which are collinear, then there are
homogeneous coordinate vectors w
~ , ~x, ~y, and ~z for the projective points, and a
basis B for R3 , satisfying this.

To prove the lemma, because W, X, and Y are not on the same projective line,
any homogeneous coordinate vectors w
~ 0 , ~x0 , and ~y0 do not line on the same
plane through the origin in R3 and so form a spanning set for R3 . Thus any
homogeneous coordinate vector for Z is a combination ~z0 = a ¬∑ w
~ 0 + b ¬∑~x0 + c ¬∑ ~y0 .
Then let the basis be B = h~

Finish the proof by noting that these projective points are on one projective
line because the sum of the three homogeneous coordinate vectors is zero.
Every projective theorem has a translation to a Euclidean version, although
the Euclidean result may be messier to state and prove. Desargue‚Äôs theorem
illustrates this. In the translation to Euclidean space, we must treat separately
the case where O lies on the ideal line, for then the lines T1 T2 , U1 U2 , and V1 V2
are parallel.
The remark following the statement of Desargue‚Äôs Theorem suggests thinking
of the Euclidean pictures as figures from projective geometry for a sphere model
with very large radius. That is, just as a small area of the world seems to people
living there to be flat, the projective plane is locally Euclidean.
We finish by pointing out one more thing about the projective plane. Although its local properties are familiar, the projective plane has a perhaps
unfamiliar global property. The picture below shows a projective point. At that
point we have drawn Cartesian axes, xy-axes. Of course, the axes appear in
the picture at both antipodal spots, one in the northern hemisphere (that is,

380

Chapter Four. Determinants

shown on the right) and the other in the south. Observe that in the northern
hemisphere a person who puts their right hand on the sphere, palm down, with
their thumb on the y axis will have their fingers pointing along the x-axis in the
positive direction.

The sequence of pictures below show a trip around this space: the antipodal spots
rotate around the sphere with the spot in the northern hemisphere moving up
and over the north pole, ending on the far side of the sphere, and its companion
coming to the front. (Be careful: the trip shown is not halfway around the
projective plane. It is a full circuit. The spots at either end of the dashed line
are the same projective point. So by the third sphere below the trip has pretty
much returned to the same projective point where we drew it starting above.)

=‚áí

=‚áí

At the end of the circuit, the x part of the xy-axes sticks out in the other
direction. That is, for a person to put their thumb on the y-axis and have
their fingers point positively on the x-axis, they must use their left hand. The
projective plane is not orientable ‚Äî in this geometry, left and right handedness
are not fixed properties of figures (said another way, we cannot describe a spiral
as clockwise or counterclockwise).
This exhibition of the existence of a non-orientable space raises the question
of whether our universe orientable. Could an astronaut leave earth right-handed
and return left-handed? [Gardner] is a nontechnical reference. [Clarke] is a
classic science fiction story about orientation reversal.
For an overview of projective geometry see [Courant & Robbins]. The approach we‚Äôve taken here, the analytic approach, leads to quick theorems and
illustrates the power of linear algebra; see [Hanes], [Ryan], and [Eggar]. But
another approach, the synthetic approach of deriving the results from an axiom
system, is both extraordinarily beautiful and is also the historical route of
development. Two fine sources for this approach are [Coxeter] or [Seidenberg].
An easy and interesting application is in [Davies].

This chapter considers the special case where the domain and codomain are
the same. Here we naturally ask for the domain basis and codomain basis to be
the same. That is, we want a basis B so that RepB,B (t) is as simple as possible,
where we take ‚Äòsimple‚Äô to mean that it has many zeroes. We will find that we
cannot always get a matrix having the above block partial-identity form but we
will develop a form that comes close, a representation that is nearly diagonal.

Complex Vector Spaces

This chapter requires that we factor polynomials. But many polynomials do not
factor over the real numbers; for instance, x2 + 1 does not factor into a product
of two linear polynomials with real coefficients; instead it requires complex
numbers x2 + 1 = (x ‚àí i)(x + i).

Chapter Five. Similarity

Consequently in this chapter we shall use complex numbers for our scalars,
including entries in vectors and matrices. That is, we shift from studying vector
spaces over the real numbers to vector spaces over the complex numbers. Any
real number is a complex number and in this chapter most of the examples use
only real numbers but nonetheless, the critical theorems require that the scalars
be complex. So this first section is a review of complex numbers.
In this book our approach is to shift to this more general context of taking
scalars to be complex for the pragmatic reason that we must do so in order
to move forward. However, the idea of doing vector spaces by taking scalars
from a structure other than the real numbers is an interesting and useful one.
Delightful presentations that take this approach from the start are in [Halmos]
and [Hoffman & Kunze].

I.1

Polynomial Factoring and Complex Numbers

This subsection is a review only. For a full development, including proofs,
see [Ebbinghaus].
Consider a polynomial p(x) = cn xn + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1 x + c0 with leading coefficient
cn 6= 0. The degree of the polynomial is n. If n = 0 then p is a constant
polynomial p(x) = c0 . Constant polynomials that are not the zero polynomial,
c0 6= 0, have degree zero. We define the zero polynomial to have degree ‚àí‚àû.
1.1 Remark Defining the degree of the zero polynomial to be ‚àí‚àû allows the
equation degree(fg) = degree(f) + degree(g) to hold for all polynomials.
Just as integers have a division operation ‚Äî e.g., ‚Äò4 goes 5 times into 21 with
remainder 1‚Äô ‚Äî so do polynomials.
1.2 Theorem (Division Theorem for Polynomials) Let p(x) be a polynomial. If d(x)
is a non-zero polynomial then there are quotient and remainder polynomials
q(x) and r(x) such that
p(x) = d(x) ¬∑ q(x) + r(x)
where the degree of r(x) is strictly less than the degree of d(x).
The point of the integer statement ‚Äò4 goes 5 times into 21 with remainder
1‚Äô is that the remainder is less than 4 ‚Äî while 4 goes 5 times, it does not go 6
times. Similarly, the final clause of the polynomial division statement is crucial.
1.3 Example If p(x) = 2x3 ‚àí 3x2 + 4x and d(x) = x2 + 1 then q(x) = 2x ‚àí 3 and

Section I. Complex Vector Spaces

385

r(x) = 2x + 3. Note that r(x) has a lower degree than does d(x).
1.4 Corollary The remainder when p(x) is divided by x ‚àí Œª is the constant
polynomial r(x) = p(Œª).
Proof The remainder must be a constant polynomial because it is of degree less

than the divisor x ‚àí Œª. To determine the constant, take the theorem‚Äôs divisor
d(x) to be x ‚àí Œª and substitute Œª for x.
QED
If a divisor d(x) goes into a dividend p(x) evenly, meaning that r(x) is the
zero polynomial, then d(x) is a called a factor of p(x). Any root of the factor,
any Œª ‚àà R such that d(Œª) = 0, is a root of p(x) since p(Œª) = d(Œª) ¬∑ q(Œª) = 0.
1.5 Corollary If Œª is a root of the polynomial p(x) then x ‚àí Œª divides p(x) evenly,
that is, x ‚àí Œª is a factor of p(x).
Proof By the above corollary p(x) = (x ‚àí Œª) ¬∑ q(x) + p(Œª). Since Œª is a root,

p(Œª) = 0 so x ‚àí Œª is a factor.

QED

A repeated root of a polynomial is a number Œª such that the polynomial is
evenly divisible by (x ‚àí Œª)n for some power larger than one. The largest such
power is called the multiplicity of Œª.
Finding the roots and factors of a high-degree polynomial can be hard.
But for second-degree polynomials we have the quadratic formula: the roots of
ax2 + bx + c are these
‚àö
‚àö
‚àíb + b2 ‚àí 4ac
‚àíb ‚àí b2 ‚àí 4ac
Œª1 =
Œª2 =
2a
2a
(if the discriminant b2 ‚àí 4ac is negative then the polynomial has no real number
roots). A polynomial that cannot be factored into two lower-degree polynomials
with real number coefficients is said to be irreducible over the reals.
1.6 Theorem Any constant or linear polynomial is irreducible over the reals. A
quadratic polynomial is irreducible over the reals if and only if its discriminant
is negative. No cubic or higher-degree polynomial is irreducible over the reals.
1.7 Corollary Any polynomial with real coefficients can be factored into linear
and irreducible quadratic polynomials. That factorization is unique; any two
factorizations have the same powers of the same factors.
Note the analogy with the prime factorization of integers. In both cases the
uniqueness clause is very useful.

1.8 Example Because of uniqueness we know, without multiplying them out, that
(x + 3)2 (x2 + 1)3 does not equal (x + 3)4 (x2 + x + 1)2 .
1.9 Example By uniqueness, if c(x) = m(x)¬∑q(x) then where c(x) = (x‚àí3)2 (x+2)3
and m(x) = (x ‚àí 3)(x + 2)2 , we know that q(x) = (x ‚àí 3)(x + 2).
While x2 +1 has no real roots and so doesn‚Äôt factor over the real numbers, if we
imagine a root ‚Äî traditionally denoted i, so that i2 + 1 = 0 ‚Äî then x2 + 1 factors
into a product of linears (x‚àíi)(x+i). When we adjoin this root i to the reals and
close the new system with respect to addition and multiplication then we have
the complex numbers C = {a + bi | a, b ‚àà R and i2 = ‚àí1 }. (These are often
pictured on a plane with a plotted on the horizontal axis and b on the vertical;
‚àö
note that the distance of the point from the origin is |a + bi| = a2 + b2 .)
In C all quadratics factor. That is, in contrast with the reals, C has no
irreducible quadratics.

1.2 Definition The matrices T and TÃÇ are similar if there is a nonsingular P such
that TÃÇ = PT P‚àí1 .
Since nonsingular matrices are square, T and TÃÇ must be square and of the same
size. Exercise 15 checks that similarity is an equivalence relation.

1.4 Example The only matrix similar to the zero matrix is itself: PZP‚àí1 = PZ = Z.
The identity matrix has the same property: PIP‚àí1 = PP‚àí1 = I.
Matrix similarity is a special case of matrix equivalence so if two matrices
are similar then they are matrix equivalent. What about the converse: if they
are square, must any two matrix equivalent matrices be similar? No; the matrix
equivalence class of an identity matrix consists of all nonsingular matrices of
that size while the prior example shows that the only member of the similarity
class of an identity matrix is itself. Thus these two are matrix equivalent but
not similar.

To understand the similarity relation we shall study the similarity classes.
We approach this question in the same way that we‚Äôve studied both the row
equivalence and matrix equivalence relations, by finding a canonical form for
representatives of the similarity classes, called Jordan form. With this canonical
form, we can decide if two matrices are similar by checking whether they are in
a class with the same representative. We‚Äôve also seen with both row equivalence
and matrix equivalence that a canonical form gives us insight into the ways in
which members of the same class are alike (e.g., two identically-sized matrices
are matrix equivalent if and only if they have the same rank).

Diagonalizability

The prior subsection shows that although similar matrices are necessarily matrix
equivalent, the converse does not hold. Some matrix equivalence classes break
into two or more similarity classes; for instance, the nonsingular 2√ó2 matrices
form one matrix equivalence class but more than one similarity class.
Thus we cannot use the canonical form for matrix equivalence, a block
partial-identity matrix, as a canonical form for matrix similarity. The diagram
below illustrates. The stars are similarity class representatives. Each dashed-line
similarity class subdivision has one star but each solid-curve matrix equivalence
class division has only one partial identity matrix.

To develop a canonical form for representatives of the similarity classes we
naturally build on previous work. This means first that the partial identity
matrices should represent the similarity classes into which they fall. Beyond
that, the representatives should be as simple as possible. The simplest extension
of the partial identity form is the diagonal form.
2.1 Definition A transformation is diagonalizable if it has a diagonal representation with respect to the same basis for the codomain as for the domain. A
diagonalizable matrix is one that is similar to a diagonal matrix: T is diagonalizable if there is a nonsingular P such that PT P‚àí1 is diagonal.

The fact that N is not the zero matrix means that it cannot be similar to the
zero matrix, because the zero matrix is similar only to itself. Thus if N were to

394

Chapter Five. Similarity

be similar to a diagonal matrix then that matrix would have have at least one
nonzero entry on its diagonal.
The square of N is the zero matrix. This implies that for any map n
represented by N (with respect to some B, B) the composition n ‚ó¶ n is the zero
map. This in turn implies that for any matrix representing n (with respect to
some BÃÇ, BÃÇ), its square is the zero matrix. But the square of a nonzero diagonal
matrix cannot be the zero matrix, because the square of a diagonal matrix is the
diagonal matrix whose entries are the squares of the entries from the starting
matrix. Thus there is no BÃÇ, BÃÇ such that n is represented by a diagonal matrix ‚Äî
the matrix N is not diagonalizable.
That example shows that a diagonal form will not suffice as a canonical form
for similarity ‚Äî we cannot find a diagonal matrix in each matrix similarity class.
However, some similarity classes contain a diagonal matrix and the canonical
form that we are developing has the property that if a matrix can be diagonalized
then the diagonal matrix is the canonical representative of its similarity class.

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

We will next focus on the property of Lemma 2.4.
3.1 Definition A transformation t : V ‚Üí V has a scalar eigenvalue Œª if there is a
nonzero eigenvector ~Œ∂ ‚àà V such that t(~Œ∂) = Œª ¬∑ ~Œ∂.
(‚ÄúEigen‚Äù is German for ‚Äúcharacteristic of‚Äù or ‚Äúpeculiar to.‚Äù Some authors call
these characteristic values and vectors. No authors call them ‚Äúpeculiar.‚Äù)

Ô£¨ Ô£∑
Ô£≠yÔ£∏

where x and y are scalars that are not both zero.
In contrast, a number that is not an eigenvalue of of this map is 2, since
assuming that œÄ doubles a vector leads to the equations x = 2x, y = 2y, and
0 = 2z, and thus no non-~0 vector is doubled.
Note that the definition requires that the eigenvector be non-~0. Some authors
allow ~0 as an eigenvector for Œª as long as there are also non-~0 vectors associated
with Œª. The key point is to disallow the trivial case where Œª is such that t(~v) = Œª~v
for only the single vector ~v = ~0.
Also, note that the eigenvalue Œª could be 0. The issue is whether ~Œ∂ equals ~0.

398

Chapter Five. Similarity

3.3 Example The only transformation on the trivial space {~0 } is ~0 7‚Üí ~0. This
map has no eigenvalues because there are no non-~0 vectors ~v mapped to a scalar
multiple Œª ¬∑ ~v of themselves.
3.4 Example Consider the homomorphism t : P1 ‚Üí P1 given by c0 + c1 x 7‚Üí
(c0 + c1 ) + (c0 + c1 )x. While the codomain P1 of t is two-dimensional, its range
is one-dimensional R(t) = {c + cx | c ‚àà C}. Application of t to a vector in that
range will simply rescale the vector c + cx 7‚Üí (2c) + (2c)x. That is, t has an
eigenvalue of 2 associated with eigenvectors of the form c + cx where c 6= 0.
This map also has an eigenvalue of 0 associated with eigenvectors of the form
c ‚àí cx where c 6= 0.
The definition above is for maps. We can give a matrix version.
3.5 Definition A square matrix T has a scalar eigenvalue Œª associated with the
nonzero eigenvector ~Œ∂ if T ~Œ∂ = Œª ¬∑ ~Œ∂.
This extension of the definition for maps to a definition for matrices is natural
but there is a point on which we must take care. The eigenvalues of a map are also
the eigenvalues of matrices representing that map, and so similar matrices have
the same eigenvalues. However, the eigenvectors can differ ‚Äî similar matrices
need not have the same eigenvectors. The next example explains.

3.9 Definition The characteristic polynomial of a square matrix T is the
determinant |T ‚àí xI| where x is a variable. The characteristic equation is
|T ‚àí xI| = 0. The characteristic polynomial of a transformation t is the
characteristic polynomial of any matrix representation RepB,B (t).
Exercise 34 checks that the characteristic polynomial of a transformation is
well-defined, that is, that the characteristic polynomial is the same no matter
which basis we use for the representation.
3.10 Lemma A linear transformation on a nontrivial vector space has at least
one eigenvalue.
Proof Any root of the characteristic polynomial is an eigenvalue. Over the

complex numbers, any polynomial of degree one or greater has a root.

QED

3.11 Remark That result is the reason that in this chapter we use scalars that
are complex numbers. Had we stuck to real number scalars then there would be
characteristic polynomials, such as x2 + 1, that do not factor.
3.12 Definition The eigenspace of a transformation t associated with the
eigenvalue Œª is VŒª = { ~Œ∂ | t(~Œ∂ ) = Œª~Œ∂ }. The eigenspace of a matrix is analogous.
3.13 Lemma An eigenspace is a subspace. It is a nontrivial subspace.

402

Chapter Five. Similarity

Proof Notice first that VŒª is not empty; it contains the zero vector since t(~0) = ~0,
which equals Œª ¬∑ ~0. To show that an eigenspace is a subspace, what remains is to
check closure of this set under linear combinations. Take ~Œ∂1 , . . . , ~Œ∂n ‚àà VŒª and
then

t(c1 ~Œ∂1 + c2 ~Œ∂2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn ~Œ∂n ) = c1 t(~Œ∂1 ) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn t(~Œ∂n )
= c1 Œª~Œ∂1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn Œª~Œ∂n
= Œª(c1 ~Œ∂1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn ~Œ∂n )
that the combination is also an element of VŒª .
The space VŒª contains more than just the zero vector because by definition
Œª is an eigenvector only if t(~Œ∂ ) = Œª~Œ∂ has solutions for ~Œ∂ other than ~0.

The characteristic equation in Example 3.7 is 0 = x(x ‚àí 2)2 so in some sense
2 is an eigenvalue twice. However there are not twice as many eigenvectors in
that the dimension of the associated eigenspace V2 is one, not two. The next
example is a case where a number is a double root of the characteristic equation
and the dimension of the associated eigenspace is two.

3.17 Definition Where a characteristic polynomial factors into (x ‚àí Œª1 )m1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (x ‚àí
Œªk )mk then the eigenvalue Œªi has algebraic multiplicity mi . Its geometric
multiplicity is the dimension of the associated eigenspace VŒªi .
In Example 3.16, there are two eigenvalues, For Œª1 = 1 both the algebraic
and geometric multiplicities are 2. For Œª2 = 0 both the algebraic and geometric
multiplicities are 1. In contrast, Example 3.14 shows that the eigenvalue Œª = 2
has algebraic multiplicity 2 but geometric multiplicity 1. For every transformation, each eigenvalue has geometric multiplicity greater than or equal to 1 by
Lemma 3.13. (And, an eigenvalue must have geometric multiplicity less than or
equal to its algebraic multiplicity, although proving this is beyond our scope.)
By Lemma 3.13 if two eigenvectors ~v1 and ~v2 are associated with the same
eigenvalue then a linear combination of those two is also an eigenvector, associated
with the same eigenvalue. As an illustration, referring to the prior example, this
sum of two members of V1

eigenspaces.

3.18 Theorem For any set of distinct eigenvalues of a map or matrix, a set of
associated eigenvectors, one per eigenvalue, is linearly independent.
Proof We will use induction on the number of eigenvalues. The base step is

that there are zero eigenvalues. Then the set of associated vectors is empty and
so is linearly independent.
For the inductive step assume that the statement is true for any set of
k > 0 distinct eigenvalues. Consider distinct eigenvalues Œª1 , . . . , Œªk+1 and let
~v1 , . . . ,~vk+1 be associated eigenvectors. Suppose that ~0 = c1~v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck~vk +
ck+1~vk+1 . Derive two equations from that, the first by multiplying by Œªk+1 on
both sides ~0 = c1 Œªk+1~v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck+1 Œªk+1~vk+1 and the second by applying the
map to both sides ~0 = c1 t(~v1 )+¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑+ck+1 t(~vk+1 ) = c1 Œª1~v1 +¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑+ck+1 Œªk+1~vk+1
(applying the matrix gives the same result). Subtract the second from the first.
~0 = c1 (Œªk+1 ‚àí Œª1 )~v1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck (Œªk+1 ‚àí Œªk )~vk + ck+1 (Œªk+1 ‚àí Œªk+1 )~vk+1
The ~vk+1 term vanishes. Then the induction hypothesis gives that c1 (Œªk+1 ‚àí
Œª1 ) = 0, . . . , ck (Œªk+1 ‚àí Œªk ) = 0. The eigenvalues are distinct so the coefficients
c1 , . . . , ck are all 0. With that we are left with the equation ~0 = ck+1~vk+1 so
ck+1 is also 0.

QED

This section observes that some matrices are similar to a diagonal matrix.
The idea of eigenvalues arose as the entries of that diagonal matrix, although
the definition applies more broadly than just to diagonalizable matrices. To find
eigenvalues we defined the characteristic equation and that led to the final result,
a criterion for diagonalizability. (While it is useful for the theory, note that in

405

Section II. Similarity

applications finding eigenvalues this way is typically impractical; for one thing
the matrix may be large and finding roots of large-degree polynomials is hard.)
In the next section we study matrices that cannot be diagonalized.

This chapter shows that every square matrix is similar to one that is a sum of
two kinds of simple matrices. The prior section focused on the first simple kind,
diagonal matrices. We now consider the other kind.

III.1

Self-Composition

Because a linear transformation t : V ‚Üí V has the same domain as codomain,
we can compose t with itself t2 = t ‚ó¶ t, and t3 = t ‚ó¶ t ‚ó¶ t, etc.‚àó

t(~v )
t2 (~v )

Note that the superscript power notation tj for iterates of the transformations
fits with the notation that we‚Äôve used for their square matrix representations
because if RepB,B (t) = T then RepB,B (tj ) = T j .

1.4 Lemma For any transformation t : V ‚Üí V, the range spaces of the powers
form a descending chain
V ‚äá R(t) ‚äá R(t2 ) ‚äá ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑
and the null spaces form an ascending chain.
{~0 } ‚äÜ N (t) ‚äÜ N (t2 ) ‚äÜ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑
Further, there is a k such that for powers less than k the subsets are proper so that
if j < k then R(tj ) ‚äÉ R(tj+1 ) and N (tj ) ‚äÇ N (tj+1 ), while for higher powers
the sets are equal so that if j > k then R(tj ) = R(tj+1 ) and N (tj ) = N (tj+1 )).
Proof First recall that for any map the dimension of its range space plus

the dimension of its null space equals the dimension of its domain. So if the

410

Chapter Five. Similarity

dimensions of the range spaces shrink then the dimensions of the null spaces
must rise. We will do the range space half here and leave the rest for Exercise 14.
We start by showing that the range spaces form a chain. If w
~ ‚àà R(tj+1 ), so
j+1
j
that w
~ = t (~v) for some ~v, then w
~ = t ( t(~v) ). Thus w
~ ‚àà R(tj ).
Next we verify the ‚Äúfurther‚Äù property: in the chain the subsets containments
are proper initially, and then from some power k onward the range spaces
are equal. We first show that if any pair of adjacent range spaces in the
chain are equal R(tk ) = R(tk+1 ) then all subsequent ones are also equal
R(tk+1 ) = R(tk+2 ), etc. This holds because t : R(tk+1 ) ‚Üí R(tk+2 ) is the
same map, with the same domain, as t : R(tk ) ‚Üí R(tk+1 ) and it therefore has
the same range R(tk+1 ) = R(tk+2 ) (it holds for all higher powers by induction).
So if the chain of range spaces ever stops strictly decreasing then from that point
onward it is stable.
We end by showing that the chain must eventually stop decreasing. Each
range space is a subspace of the one before it. For it to be a proper subspace it
must be of strictly lower dimension (see Exercise 12). These spaces are finitedimensional and so the chain can fall for only finitely many steps. That is, the
power k is at most the dimension of V.

1.5 Example The derivative map a + bx + cx2 + dx3 7‚àí‚Üí b + 2cx + 3dx2 on P3
has this chain of range spaces.
R(t0 ) = P3 ‚äÉ R(t1 ) = P2 ‚äÉ R(t2 ) = P1 ‚äÉ R(t3 ) = P0 ‚äÉ R(t4 ) = {~0 }
All later elements of the chain are the trivial space. It has this chain of null
spaces.
N (t0 ) = {~0 } ‚äÇ N (t1 ) = P0 ‚äÇ N (t2 ) = P1 ‚äÇ N (t3 ) = P2 ‚äÇ N (t4 ) = P3
Later elements are the entire space.
1.6 Example Let t : P2 ‚Üí P2 be the map d0 + d1 x + d2 x2 7‚Üí 2d0 + d2 x. As the
lemma describes, on iteration the range space shrinks
R(t0 ) = P2

R(t) = {a0 + a1 x | a0 , a1 ‚àà C }

R(t2 ) = {a0 | a0 ‚àà C}

and then stabilizes, so that R(t2 ) = R(t3 ) = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ . The null space grows
N (t0 ) = {0 }

N (t) = {b1 x | b1 ‚àà C } N (t2 ) = {b1 x + b2 x2 | b1 , b2 ‚àà C}

and then stabilizes N (t2 ) = N (t3 ) = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ .

1.8 Definition Let t be a transformation on an n-dimensional space. The generalized range space (or closure of the range space) is R‚àû (t) = R(tn ). The
generalized null space (or closure of the null space) is N‚àû (t) = N (tn ).
This graph illustrates. The horizontal axis gives the power j of a transformation. The vertical axis gives the dimension of the range space of tj as the
distance above zero, and thus also shows the dimension of the null space because
the two add to the dimension n of the domain.

On iteration the rank falls and the nullity rises until there is some k such
that the map reaches a steady state R(tk ) = R(tk+1 ) = R‚àû (t) and N (tk ) =
N (tk+1 ) = N‚àû (t). This must happen by the n-th iterate.

Strings

This requires material from the optional Combining Subspaces subsection.
The prior subsection shows that as j increases the dimensions of the R(tj )‚Äôs
fall while the dimensions of the N (tj )‚Äôs rise, in such a way that this rank and
nullity split between them the dimension of V. Can we say more; do the two
split a basis ‚Äî is V = R(tj ) ‚äï N (tj )?
The answer is yes for the smallest power j = 0 since V = R(t0 ) ‚äï N (t0 ) =
V ‚äï {~0 }. The answer is also yes at the other extreme.
2.1 Lemma For any linear t : V ‚Üí V the function t : R‚àû (t) ‚Üí R‚àû (t) is one-toone.
Proof Let the dimension of V be n. Because R(tn ) = R(tn+1 ), the map

t : R‚àû (t) ‚Üí R‚àû (t) is a dimension-preserving homomorphism. Therefore, by
Theorem Two.II.2.20 it is one-to-one.
QED
2.2 Corollary Where t : V ‚Üí V is a linear transformation, the space is the direct
sum V = R‚àû (t)‚äïN‚àû (t). That is, both (1) dim(V) = dim(R‚àû (t))+dim(N‚àû (t))
and (2) R‚àû (t) ‚à© N‚àû (t) = {~0 }.
Proof Let the dimension of V be n. We will verify the second sentence, which

is equivalent to the first. Clause (1) is true because any transformation satisfies

413

Section III. Nilpotence

that its rank plus its nullity equals the dimension of the space, and in particular
this holds for the transformation tn .
For clause (2), assume that ~v ‚àà R‚àû (t) ‚à© N‚àû (t) to prove that ~v = ~0. Because
~v is in the generalized null space, tn (~v) = ~0. On the other hand, by the lemma
t : R‚àû (t) ‚Üí R‚àû (t) is one-to-one and a composition of one-to-one maps is oneto-one, so tn : R‚àû (t) ‚Üí R‚àû (t) is one-to-one. Only ~0 is sent by a one-to-one
linear map to ~0 so the fact that tn (~v) = ~0 implies that ~v = ~0.
QED
2.3 Remark Technically there is a difference between the map t : V ‚Üí V and
the map on the subspace t : R‚àû (t) ‚Üí R‚àû (t) if the generalized range space is
not equal to V, because the domains are different. But the difference is small
because the second is the restriction of the first to R‚àû (t).
For powers between j = 0 and j = n, the space V might not be the direct
sum of R(tj ) and N (tj ). The next example shows that the two can have a
nontrivial intersection.

The new matrix is nilpotent; its fourth power is the zero matrix. We could
verify this with a tedious computation or we can instead just observe that it is
nilpotent since its fourth power is similar to NÃÇ4 , the zero matrix, and the only
matrix similar to the zero matrix is itself.
(PNÃÇP‚àí1 )4 = PNÃÇP‚àí1 ¬∑ PNÃÇP‚àí1 ¬∑ PNÃÇP‚àí1 ¬∑ PNÃÇP‚àí1 = PNÃÇ4 P‚àí1
The goal of this subsection is to show that the prior example is prototypical
in that every nilpotent matrix is similar to one that is all zeros except for blocks
of subdiagonal ones.
2.11 Definition Let t be a nilpotent transformation on V. A t-string of length
k generated by ~v ‚àà V is a sequence h~v, t(~v), . . . , tk‚àí1 (~v)i. A t-string basis is a
basis that is a concatenation of t-strings.
2.12 Example Consider differentiation d/dx : P2 ‚Üí P2 . The sequence hx2 , 2x, 2, 0i
is a d/dx-string of length 4. The sequence hx2 , 2x, 2i is a d/dx-string of length 3
that is a basis for P2 .
Note that the strings cannot form a basis under concatenation if they are

2.14 Lemma If a space has a t-string basis then the index of nilpotency of t is
the length of the longest string in that basis.
Proof Let the space have a basis of t-strings and let t‚Äôs index of nilpotency

be k. We cannot have that the longest string in that basis is longer than t‚Äôs
index of nilpotency because tk sends any vector, including the vector starting
the longest string, to ~0. Therefore instead suppose that the space has a t-string
basis B where all of the strings are shorter than length k. Because t has index k,
there is a vector ~v such that tk‚àí1 (~v) 6= ~0. Represent ~v as a linear combination
of elements from B and apply tk‚àí1 . We are supposing that tk‚àí1 maps each
element of B to ~0, and therefore maps each term in the linear combination to ~0,
but also that it does not map ~v to ~0. That is a contradiction.
QED
We shall show that each nilpotent map has an associated string basis, a basis
of disjoint strings.
To see the main idea of the argument, imagine that we want to construct
a counterexample, a map that is nilpotent but without an associated disjoint
string basis. We might think to make something like the map t : C5 ‚Üí C5 with
this action.

But, the fact that the shown basis isn‚Äôt disjoint doesn‚Äôt mean that there isn‚Äôt
another basis that consists of disjoint strings.
To produce such a basis for this map we will first find the number and lengths
of its strings. Observer that t‚Äôs index of nilpotency is two. Lemma 2.14 says
that at least one string in a disjoint string basis has length two. There are five
basis elements so if there is a disjoint string basis then the map must act in one
of these ways.

While the basis is not unique, the number and the length of the strings is

For the inductive step, assume that the theorem holds for any transformation
t : V ‚Üí V with an index of nilpotency between 1 and k ‚àí 1 (with k > 1) and
consider the index k case.
Observe that the restriction of t to the range space t : R(t) ‚Üí R(t) is also
nilpotent, of index k ‚àí 1. Apply the inductive hypothesis to get a string basis
for R(t), where the number and length of the strings is determined by t.

(In the illustration the ~Œæ‚Äôs are the vectors of kind 2 and so the set CÃÇ is the set of

by t, what is uniquely determined is the number of them: it is the dimension of
N (t) minus the dimension of R(t) ‚à© N (t).
_
Finally, B CÃÇ is a basis for R(t) + N (t) because any sum of something in the
range space with something in the null space can be represented using elements
of B for the range space part and elements of CÃÇ for the part from the null space.

This form is unique in the sense that if a nilpotent matrix is similar to two
such matrices then those two simply have their blocks ordered differently. Thus
this is a canonical form for the similarity classes of nilpotent matrices provided

The table tells us this about any string basis: the null space after one map
application has dimension two so two basis vectors map directly to zero, the
null space after the second application has dimension four so two additional
basis vectors map to zero by the second iteration, and the null space after three
applications is of dimension five so the remaining one basis vector maps to zero

Section IV. Jordan Form

IV

Jordan Form

This section uses material from three optional subsections: Combining
Subspaces, Determinants Exist, and Laplace‚Äôs Expansion.
We began this chapter by remembering that every linear map h : V ‚Üí W can
be represented by a partial identity matrix with respect to some bases B ‚äÇ V
and D ‚äÇ W. That is, the partial identity form is a canonical form for matrix
equivalence. This chapter considers transformations, where the codomain equals
the domain, so we naturally ask what is possible when the two bases are equal
RepB,B (t). In short, we want a canonical form for matrix similarity.
We noted that in the B, B case a partial identity matrix is not always possible.
We therefore extended the matrix forms of interest to the natural generalization,
diagonal matrices, and showed that a transformation or square matrix can be
diagonalized if its eigenvalues are distinct. But at the same time we gave an
example of a square matrix that cannot be diagonalized (because it is nilpotent)
and thus diagonal form won‚Äôt suffice as the canonical form for matrix similarity.
The prior section developed that example to get a canonical form, subdiagonal
ones, for nilpotent matrices.
This section finishes our program by showing that for any linear transformation there is a basis such that the matrix representation RepB,B (t) is the sum of
a diagonal matrix and a nilpotent matrix. This is Jordan canonical form.

IV.1

Polynomials of Maps and Matrices

Recall that the set of square matrices Mn√ón is a vector space under entry-byentry addition and scalar multiplication, and that this space has dimension n2 .
2
Thus, for any n√ón matrix T the n2 + 1-member set {I, T, T 2 , . . . , T n } is linearly
dependent and so there are scalars c0 , . . . , cn2 , not all zero, such that
2

cn2 T n + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1 T + c0 I
is the zero matrix. Therefore every transformation has a kind of generalized
nilpotency: the powers of a square matrix cannot climb forever without a ‚Äúrepeat.‚Äù

424

Chapter Five. Similarity

1.2 Definition Let t be a linear transformation of a vector space V. Where
f(x) = cn xn + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1 x + c0 is a polynomial, f(t) is the transformation cn tn +
¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1 t + c0 (id) on V. In the same way, if T is a square matrix then f(T ) is
the matrix cn T n + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1 T + c0 I.
The polynomial of the matrix represents the polynomial of the map: if T =
RepB,B (t) then f(T ) = RepB,B (f(t)). This is because T j = RepB,B (tj ), and
cT = RepB,B (ct), and T1 + T2 = RepB,B (t1 + t2 ).
1.3 Remark Most authors write the matrix polynomial slightly differently than the
map polynomial. For instance, if f(x) = x ‚àí 3 then most authors explicitly write
the identity matrix f(T ) = T ‚àí 3I but don‚Äôt write the identity map f(t) = t ‚àí 3.
We shall follow this convention.
Consider again Example 1.1. The space M2√ó2 has dimension four so we know
that for any 2√ó2 matrix there is a fourth degree polynomial f such that f(T )
equals the zero matrix. But for the T in that example we exhibited a polynomial
of degree less than four that gives the zero matrix. So while degree n2 always
suffices, in some cases a smaller-degree polynomial works.
1.4 Definition The minimal polynomial m(x) of a transformation t or a square
matrix T is the polynomial of least degree and with leading coefficient one such
that m(t) is the zero map or m(T ) is the zero matrix.
A minimal polynomial cannot be the zero polynomial because of the restriction
on the leading coefficient. Obviously no other constant polynomial would do, so
a minimal polynomial must have degree at least one. Thus, the zero matrix has
minimal polynomial p(x) = x while the identity matrix has minimal polynomial
pÃÇ(x) = x ‚àí 1.
1.5 Lemma Any transformation or square matrix has a unique minimal polynomial.
Proof We first prove existence. By the earlier observation that degree n2

suffices, there is at least one polynomial p(x) = ck xk + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c0 that takes the
map or matrix to zero, and it is not the zero polynomial by the prior paragraph.
From among all such polynomials there must be at least one with minimal degree.
Divide this polynomial by its leading coefficient ck to get a leading 1. Hence
any map or matrix has a minimal polynomial.
Now for uniqueness. Suppose that m(x) and mÃÇ(x) both take the map or
matrix to zero, are both of minimal degree and are thus of equal degree, and
both have a leading 1. Subtract: d(x) = m(x) ‚àí mÃÇ(x). This polynomial takes

425

Section IV. Jordan Form

the map or matrix to zero and since the leading terms of m and mÃÇ cancel, d is of
smaller degree than the other two. If d were to have a nonzero leading coefficient
then we could divide by it to get a polynomial that takes the map or matrix to
zero and has leading coefficient 1. This would contradict the minimality of the
degree of m and mÃÇ. Thus the leading coefficient of d is zero, so m(x) ‚àí mÃÇ(x) is
the zero polynomial, and so the two are equal.

Setting c4 , c3 , and c2 to zero forces c1 and c0 to also come out as zero. To get
a leading one, the most we can do is to set c4 and c3 to zero. Thus the minimal
polynomial is quadratic.
Using the method of that example to find the minimal polynomial of a 3√ó3
matrix would mean doing Gaussian reduction on a system with nine equations
in ten unknowns. We shall develop an alternative.
1.7 Lemma Suppose that the polynomial f(x) = cn xn + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1 x + c0 factors
as k(x ‚àí Œª1 )q1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (x ‚àí Œªz )qz . If t is a linear transformation then these two are
equal maps.
cn tn + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1 t + c0 = k ¬∑ (t ‚àí Œª1 )q1 ‚ó¶ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚ó¶ (t ‚àí Œªz )qz
Consequently, if T is a square matrix then f(T ) and k ¬∑ (T ‚àí Œª1 I)q1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (T ‚àí Œªz I)qz
are equal matrices.
Proof We use induction on the degree of the polynomial. The cases where

the polynomial is of degree zero and degree one are clear. The full induction
argument is Exercise 1.7 but we will give its sense with the degree two case.

A quadratic polynomial factors into two linear terms f(x) = k(x ‚àí Œª1 ) ¬∑ (x ‚àí

check that substituting t for x in the factored and unfactored versions gives the
same map.

The third equality holds because the scalar Œª2 comes out of the second term,
since t is linear.
QED
In particular, if a minimal polynomial m(x) for a transformation t factors
as m(x) = (x ‚àí Œª1 )q1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (x ‚àí Œªz )qz then m(t) = (t ‚àí Œª1 )q1 ‚ó¶ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚ó¶ (t ‚àí Œªz )qz is
the zero map. Since m(t) sends every vector to zero, at least one of the maps
t ‚àí Œªi sends some nonzero vectors to zero. Exactly the same holds in the matrix
case ‚Äî if m is minimal for T then m(T ) = (T ‚àí Œª1 I)q1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (T ‚àí Œªz I)qz is the zero
matrix and at least one of the matrices T ‚àí Œªi I sends some nonzero vectors to
zero. That is, in both cases at least some of the Œªi are eigenvalues. (Exercise 29
expands on this.)
The next result is that every root of the minimal polynomial is an eigenvalue,
and further that every eigenvalue is a root of the minimal polynomial (i.e, below
it says ‚Äò1 6 qi ‚Äô and not just ‚Äò0 6 qi ‚Äô). For that result, recall that to find
eigenvalues we solve |T ‚àí xI| = 0 and this determinant gives a polynomial in x,
called the characteristic polynomial, whose roots are the eigenvalues.
1.8 Theorem (Cayley-Hamilton) If the characteristic polynomial of a transformation or square matrix factors into
k ¬∑ (x ‚àí Œª1 )p1 (x ‚àí Œª2 )p2 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (x ‚àí Œªz )pz
then its minimal polynomial factors into
(x ‚àí Œª1 )q1 (x ‚àí Œª2 )q2 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (x ‚àí Œªz )qz
where 1 6 qi 6 pi for each i between 1 and z.
The proof takes up the next three lemmas. We will state them in matrix terms
but they apply equally well to maps. (The matrix version is convenient for the
first proof.)
The first result is the key. For the proof, observe that we can view a matrix

The left side of (‚àó) is cn Ixn +cn‚àí1 Ixn‚àí1 +¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑+c1 Ix+c0 I. For the right side, the
entries of adj(C) are polynomials, each of degree at most n ‚àí 1 since the minors
of a matrix drop a row and column. As suggested before the proof, rewrite it
as a polynomial with matrix coefficients: adj(C) = Cn‚àí1 xn‚àí1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + C1 x + C0
where each Ci is a matrix of scalars. Now this is the right side of (‚àó).

The total on the right is the zero matrix.
QED
We refer to that result by saying that a matrix or map satisfies its characteristic polynomial.
1.10 Lemma Where f(x) is a polynomial, if f(T ) is the zero matrix then f(x)
is divisible by the minimal polynomial of T . That is, any polynomial that is
satisfied by T is divisible by T ‚Äôs minimal polynomial.
Proof Let m(x) be minimal for T . The Division Theorem for Polynomials gives

f(x) = q(x)m(x) + r(x) where the degree of r is strictly less than the degree of
m. Because T satisfies both f and m, plugging T into that equation gives that
r(T ) is the zero matrix. That contradicts the minimality of m unless r is the
zero polynomial.
QED
Combining the prior two lemmas shows that the minimal polynomial divides
the characteristic polynomial. Thus any root of the minimal polynomial is
also a root of the characteristic polynomial. That is, so far we have that if
m(x) = (x‚àíŒª1 )q1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (x‚àíŒªi )qi then c(x) has the form (x‚àíŒª1 )p1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (x‚àíŒªi )pi (x‚àí
Œªi+1 )pi+1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (x ‚àí Œªz )pz where each qj is less than or equal to pj . We finish
the proof of the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem by showing that the characteristic
polynomial has no additional roots, that is, there are no Œªi+1 , Œªi+2 , etc.
1.11 Lemma Each linear factor of the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix
is also a linear factor of the minimal polynomial.
Proof Let T be a square matrix with minimal polynomial m(x) and assume

that x ‚àí Œª is a factor of the characteristic polynomial of T , that Œª is an eigenvalue
of T . We must show that x ‚àí Œª is a factor of m, i.e., that m(Œª) = 0.
Suppose that Œª is an eigenvalue of T with associated eigenvector ~v. Then
T ¬∑ T~v = T ¬∑ Œª~v = ŒªT~v = Œª2~v. Similarly, T n~v = Œªn~v. With that, we have that for

429

Section IV. Jordan Form

any polynomial function p(x), application of the matrix p(T ) to ~v equals the
result of multiplying ~v by the scalar p(Œª).
p(T ) ¬∑ ~v = (ck T k + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1 T + c0 I) ¬∑ ~v = ck T k~v + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1 T~v + c0~v
= ck Œªk~v + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + c1 Œª~v + c0~v = p(Œª) ¬∑ ~v
Since m(T ) is the zero matrix, ~0 = m(T )(~v) = m(Œª) ¬∑ ~v for all ~v, and hence
m(Œª) = 0.
QED
That concludes the proof of the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem.

Jordan Canonical Form

We are looking for a canonical form for matrix similarity. This subsection
completes this program by moving from the canonical form for the classes of
nilpotent matrices to the canonical form for all classes.
2.1 Lemma A linear transformation on a nontrivial vector space is nilpotent if
and only if its only eigenvalue is zero.
Proof Let the linear transformation be t : V ‚Üí V. If t is nilpotent then there

is an n such that tn is the zero map, so t satisfies the polynomial p(x) = xn =
(x ‚àí 0)n . By Lemma 1.10 the minimal polynomial of t divides p, so the minimal

432

Chapter Five. Similarity

polynomial has only zero for a root. By Cayley-Hamilton, Theorem 1.8, the
characteristic polynomial has only zero for a root. Thus the only eigenvalue of t
is zero.
Conversely, if a transformation t on an n-dimensional space has only the
single eigenvalue of zero then its characteristic polynomial is xn . Lemma 1.9
says that a map satisfies its characteristic polynomial so tn is the zero map.
Thus t is nilpotent.
QED
The ‚Äònontrivial vector space‚Äô is in the statement of that lemma because on a
trivial space {~0 } the only transformation is the zero map, which has no eigenvalues
because there are no associated nonzero eigenvectors.
2.2 Corollary The transformation t‚àíŒª is nilpotent if and only if t‚Äôs only eigenvalue
is Œª.
Proof The transformation t ‚àí Œª is nilpotent if and only if t ‚àí Œª‚Äôs only eigenvalue

is 0. That holds if and only if t‚Äôs only eigenvalue is Œª, because t(~v) = Œª~v if and
only if (t ‚àí Œª) (~v) = 0 ¬∑ ~v.
QED
We already have the canonical form that we want for the case of nilpotent
matrices, that is, for each matrix whose only eigenvalue is zero. Corollary III.2.16
says that each such matrix is similar to one that is all zeroes except for blocks
of subdiagonal ones.
2.3 Lemma If the matrices T ‚àí ŒªI and N are similar then T and N + ŒªI are also
similar, via the same change of basis matrices.
Proof With N = P(T ‚àí ŒªI)P‚àí1 = PT P‚àí1 ‚àí P(ŒªI)P‚àí1 we have N = PT P‚àí1 ‚àí

PP‚àí1 (ŒªI) since the diagonal matrix ŒªI commutes with anything, and so N =
PT P‚àí1 ‚àí ŒªI. Therefore N + ŒªI = PT P‚àí1 .

An array that is all zeroes, except for some number Œª down the diagonal and
blocks of subdiagonal ones, is a Jordan block. We have shown that Jordan block
matrices are canonical representatives of the similarity classes of single-eigenvalue
matrices.

In particular, this matrix

belongs to the similarity class represented by the middle one, because we have
adopted the convention of ordering the blocks of subdiagonal ones from the
longest block to the shortest.
We will finish the program of this chapter by extending this work to cover
maps and matrices with multiple eigenvalues. The best possibility for general
maps and matrices would be if we could break them into a part involving their
first eigenvalue Œª1 (which we represent using its Jordan block), a part with Œª2 ,
etc.
This best possibility is what happens. For any transformation t : V ‚Üí V, we
shall break the space V into the direct sum of a part on which t ‚àí Œª1 is nilpotent,
a part on which t ‚àí Œª2 is nilpotent, etc.
Suppose that t : V ‚Üí V is a linear transformation. The restriction of t to a
subspace M need not be a linear transformation on M because there may be an
m
~ ‚àà M with t(m)
~ 6‚àà M (for instance, the transformation that rotates the plane
by a quarter turn does not map most members of the x = y line subspace back
within that subspace). To ensure that the restriction of a transformation to a
part of a space is a transformation on the part we need the next condition.

Section IV. Jordan Form

2.7 Definition Let t : V ‚Üí V be a transformation. A subspace M is t invariant
if whenever m
~ ‚àà M then t(m)
~ ‚àà M (shorter: t(M) ‚äÜ M).
Recall that Lemma III.1.4 shows that for any transformation t on an n dimensional space the range spaces of iterates are stable
R(tn ) = R(tn+1 ) = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = R‚àû (t)
as are the null spaces.
N (tn ) = N (tn+1 ) = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = N‚àû (t)
Thus, the generalized null space N‚àû (t) and the generalized range space R‚àû (t)
are t invariant. In particular, N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) and R‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) are t ‚àí Œªi invariant.
The action of the transformation t ‚àí Œªi on N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) is especially easy to
understand. Observe that any transformation t is nilpotent on N‚àû (t), because if
~v ‚àà N‚àû (t) then by definition tn (~v) = ~0. Thus t ‚àí Œªi is nilpotent on N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ).
We shall take three steps to prove this section‚Äôs major result. The next result
is the first.
2.8 Lemma A subspace is t invariant if and only if it is t ‚àí Œª invariant for all
scalars Œª. In particular, if Œªi is an eigenvalue of a linear transformation t then
for any other eigenvalue Œªj the spaces N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) and R‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) are t ‚àí Œªj
invariant.
Proof For the first sentence we check the two implications separately. The
‚Äòif‚Äô half is easy: if the subspace is t ‚àí Œª invariant for all scalars Œª then using
Œª = 0 shows that it is t invariant. For ‚Äòonly if‚Äô suppose that the subspace is t
invariant, so that if m
~ ‚àà M then t(m)
~ ‚àà M, and let Œª be a scalar. The subspace
M is closed under linear combinations and so if t(m)
~ ‚àà M then t(m)
~ ‚àí Œªm
~ ‚àà M.
Thus if m
~ ‚àà M then (t ‚àí Œª) (m)
~ ‚àà M.
The lemma‚Äôs second sentence follows from its first. The two spaces are
t ‚àí Œªi invariant so they are t invariant. Apply the first sentence again to
conclude that they are also t ‚àí Œªj invariant.
QED

The second step of the three that we will take to prove this section‚Äôs major
result makes use of an additional property of N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) and R‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ), that
they are complementary. Recall that if a space is the direct sum of two others
V = N ‚äï R then any vector ~v in the space breaks into two parts ~v = n
~ +~r where
n
~ ‚àà N and ~r ‚àà R, and recall also that if BN and BR are bases for N and R
_
then the concatenation BN BR is linearly independent. The next result says
that for any subspaces N and R that are complementary as well as t invariant,
the action of t on ~v breaks into the actions of t on n
~ and on ~r.

2.9 Lemma Let t : V ‚Üí V be a transformation and let N and R be t invariant
complementary subspaces of V. Then we can represent t by a matrix with blocks

Proof Since the two subspaces are complementary, the concatenation of a basis

has the desired form.
Any vector ~v ‚àà V is a member of N if and only if when it is represented
with respect to B the final q coefficients are zero. As N is t invariant, each of
the vectors RepB (t(~ŒΩ1 )), . . . , RepB (t(~ŒΩp )) has this form. Hence the lower left
of RepB,B (t) is all zeroes. The argument for the upper right is similar. QED
To see that we have decomposed t into its action on the parts, let BN =
h~ŒΩ1 , . . . , ~ŒΩp i and BR = h~¬µ1 , . . . , ~¬µq i. The restrictions of t to the subspaces N
and R are represented with respect to the bases BN , BN and BR , BR by the
matrices T1 and T2 . So with subspaces that are invariant and complementary
we can split the problem of examining a linear transformation into two lowerdimensional subproblems. The next result illustrates this decomposition into
blocks.
2.10 Lemma If T is a matrix with square submatrices T1 and T2

where the Z‚Äôs are blocks of zeroes, then |T | = |T1 | ¬∑ |T2 |.

permutation formula for the determinant

437

Section IV. Jordan Form

each term comes from a rearrangement of the column numbers 1, . . . , n into a
new order œÜ(1), . . . , œÜ(n). The upper right block Z2 is all zeroes, so if a œÜ has
at least one of p + 1, . . . , n among its first p column numbers œÜ(1), . . . , œÜ(p)
then the term arising from œÜ does not contribute to the sum because it is zero,
e.g., if œÜ(1) = n then t1,œÜ(1) t2,œÜ(2) . . . tn,œÜ(n) = 0 ¬∑ t2,œÜ(2) . . . tn,œÜ(n) = 0.
So the above formula reduces to a sum over all permutations with two
halves: any contributing œÜ is the composition of a œÜ1 that rearranges only
1, . . . , p and a œÜ2 that rearranges only p + 1, . . . , p + q. Now, the distributive
law and the fact that the signum of a composition is the product of the signums
gives that this

From Lemma 2.10 we conclude that if two subspaces are complementary and
t invariant then t is one-to-one if and only if its restriction to each subspace is
nonsingular.
Now for the promised third, and final, step to the main result.
2.12 Lemma If a linear transformation t : V ‚Üí V has the characteristic polynomial
(x ‚àí Œª1 )p1 . . . (x ‚àí Œªk )pk then (1) V = N‚àû (t ‚àí Œª1 ) ‚äï ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äï N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªk ) and
(2) dim(N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi )) = pi .
Proof This argument consists of proving two preliminary claims, followed by

proofs of clauses (1) and (2).
The first claim is that N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) ‚à© N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªj ) = {~0 } when i 6= j. By
Lemma 2.8 both N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) and N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªj ) are t invariant. The intersection
of t invariant subspaces is t invariant and so the restriction of t to N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) ‚à©
N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªj ) is a linear transformation. Now, t ‚àí Œªi is nilpotent on N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) and
t ‚àí Œªj is nilpotent on N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªj ), so both t ‚àí Œªi and t ‚àí Œªj are nilpotent on the
intersection. Therefore by Lemma 2.1 and the observation following it, if t has

438

Chapter Five. Similarity

any eigenvalues on the intersection then the ‚Äúonly‚Äù eigenvalue is both Œªi and Œªj .
This cannot be, so the restriction has no eigenvalues: N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) ‚à© N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªj )
is the trivial space (Lemma 3.10 shows that the only transformation that is
without any eigenvalues is the transformation on the trivial space).
The second claim is that N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) ‚äÜ R‚àû (t ‚àí Œªj ), where i 6= j. To verify it
we will show that t ‚àí Œªj is one-to-one on N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) so that, since N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi )
is t ‚àí Œªj invariant by Lemma 2.8, the map t ‚àí Œªj is an automorphism of the
subspace N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) and therefore that N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) is a subset of each R(t ‚àí Œªj ),
R((t ‚àí Œªj )2 ), etc. For the verification that the map is one-to-one suppose that
~v ‚àà N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) is in the null space of t ‚àí Œªj , aiming to show that ~v = ~0.
Consider the map [(t ‚àí Œªi ) ‚àí (t ‚àí Œªj )]n . On the one hand, the only vector that
(t ‚àí Œªi ) ‚àí (t ‚àí Œªj ) = Œªi ‚àí Œªj maps to zero is the zero vector. On the other hand,
as in the proof of Lemma 1.7 we can apply the binomial expansion to get this.

2
The first term is zero because ~v ‚àà N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) while the remaining terms are
zero because ~v is in the null space of t ‚àí Œªj . Therefore ~v = ~0.
With those two preliminary claims done we can prove clause (1), that the space
is the direct sum of the generalized null spaces. By Corollary III.2.2 the space is
the direct sum V = N‚àû (t ‚àí Œª1 ) ‚äï R‚àû (t ‚àí Œª1 ). By the second claim N‚àû (t ‚àí Œª2 ) ‚äÜ
R‚àû (t ‚àí Œª1 ) and so we can get a basis for R‚àû (t ‚àí Œª1 ) by starting with a basis for
N‚àû (t ‚àí Œª2 ) and adding extra basis elements taken from R‚àû (t ‚àí Œª1 ) ‚à© R‚àû (t ‚àí Œª2 ).
Thus V = N‚àû (t ‚àí Œª1 ) ‚äï N‚àû (t ‚àí Œª2 ) ‚äï (R‚àû (t ‚àí Œª1 ) ‚à© R‚àû (t ‚àí Œª2 )). Continuing
in this way we get this.
V = N‚àû (t ‚àí Œª1 ) ‚äï ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äï R‚àû (t ‚àí Œªk ) ‚äï (R‚àû (t ‚àí Œª1 ) ‚à© ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚à© R‚àû (t ‚àí Œªk ))
The first claim above shows that the final space is trivial.
We finish by verifying clause (2). Decompose V as N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) ‚äï R‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi )
and apply Lemma 2.9.

Lemma 2.10 says that |T ‚àí xI| = |T1 ‚àí xI| ¬∑ |T2 ‚àí xI|. By the uniqueness clause
of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, Theorem I.1.11, the determinants of
the blocks have the same factors as the characteristic polynomial |T1 ‚àí xI| =
(x‚àíŒª1 )q1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (x‚àíŒªz )qk and |T2 ‚àíxI| = (x‚àíŒª1 )r1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (x‚àíŒªz )rk , where q1 +r1 = p1 ,
. . . , qk + rk = pk . We will finish by establishing that (i) qj = 0 for all j 6= i,
and (ii) qi = pi . Together these prove clause (2) because they show that the

Section IV. Jordan Form

439

degree of the polynomial |T1 ‚àí xI| is qi and the degree of that polynomial equals
the dimension of the generalized null space N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ).
For (i), because the restriction of t ‚àí Œªi to N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) is nilpotent on that
space, t‚Äôs only eigenvalue on that space is Œªi , by Lemma 2.2. So qj = 0 for j 6= i.
For (ii), consider the restriction of t to R‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ). By Lemma III.2.1, the
map t ‚àí Œªi is one-to-one on R‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) and so Œªi is not an eigenvalue of t on
that subspace. Therefore x ‚àí Œªi is not a factor of |T2 ‚àí xI|, so ri = 0, and so
qi = pi .

Proof Given an n√ón matrix T , consider the linear map t : Cn ‚Üí Cn that it

Because each N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ) is t invariant, Lemma 2.9 and the prior lemma show
that t is represented by a matrix that is all zeroes except for square blocks along
the diagonal. To make those blocks into Jordan blocks, pick each BŒªi to be a
string basis for the action of t ‚àí Œªi on N‚àû (t ‚àí Œªi ).
QED
2.14 Corollary Every square matrix is similar to the sum of a diagonal matrix
and a nilpotent matrix.
For Jordan form a canonical form for matrix similarity, strictly speaking it
must be unique. That is, for any square matrix there needs to be one and only
one matrix J similar to it and of the specified form. As stated the theorem allows
us to rearrange the Jordan blocks. We could make this form unique, say by
arranging the Jordan blocks so the eigenvalues are in order, and then arranging
the blocks of subdiagonal ones from longest to shortest. Below, we won‚Äôt bother
with that.

So the contrast with the prior example is that while the characteristic
polynomial tells us to look at the action of t ‚àí 2 on its generalized null space, the
characteristic polynomial does not completely describe t ‚àí 2‚Äôs action. We must
do some computations to find that the minimal polynomial is (x ‚àí 2)(x ‚àí 6).
For the eigenvalue 6 the arguments for the second eigenvalue of the prior

Method of Powers
In applications matrices can be large. Calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors
by finding and solving the characteristic polynomial is impractical, too slow and
too error-prone. Some techniques avoid the characteristic polynomial. Here we
shall see a method that is suitable for large matrices that are sparse, meaning
that the great majority of the entries are zero.
Suppose that the n√ón matrix T has n distinct eigenvalues Œª1 , Œª2 , . . . , Œªn .
Then Cn has a basis made of the associated eigenvectors h~Œ∂1 , . . . , ~Œ∂n i. For any
~v ‚àà Cn , writing ~v = c1 ~Œ∂1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn ~Œ∂n and iterating T on ~v gives these.
T~v = c1 Œª1 ~Œ∂1 + c2 Œª2 ~Œ∂2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn Œªn ~Œ∂n
T 2~v = c1 Œª21 ~Œ∂1 + c2 Œª22 ~Œ∂2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn Œª2n ~Œ∂n
T 3~v = c1 Œª31 ~Œ∂1 + c2 Œª32 ~Œ∂2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn Œª3n ~Œ∂n
..
.
T k~v = c1 Œªk1 ~Œ∂1 + c2 Œªk2 ~Œ∂2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn Œªkn ~Œ∂n
Assuming that |Œª1 | is the largest and dividing through
Œªk
T k~v
Œªk ~
= c1 ~Œ∂1 + c2 2k ~Œ∂2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + cn n
Œ∂n
k
Œª1
Œª1
Œªk1
shows that as k gets larger the fractions go to zero and so Œª1 ‚Äôs term will dominate
the expression and that expression has a limit of c1 ~Œ∂1 .
Thus if c1 6= 0, as k increases the vectors T k~v will tend toward the direction
of the eigenvectors associated with the dominant eigenvalue. Consequently, the
ratios of the vector lengths |T k~v|/|T k‚àí1~v| tend to that dominant eigenvalue.
For example, the eigenvalues of the matrix
!
3 0
T=
8 ‚àí1
are 3 and ‚àí1. If ~v has the components 1 and 1 then iterating gives this.

The ratio between the lengths of the last two is 2.999 9.
We note two implementation issues. First, instead of finding the powers of
T and applying them to ~v, we will compute ~v1 as T~v and then compute ~v2 as
T~v1 , etc. (that is, we do not separately calculate T 2, T 3, . . . ). We can quickly
do these matrix-vector products even if T is large, provided that it is sparse.
The second issue is that to avoid generating numbers that are so large that they
overflow our computer‚Äôs capability, we can normalize the ~vi ‚Äôs at each step. For
instance, we can divide each ~vi by its length (other possibilities are to divide it
by its largest component, or simply by its first component). We thus implement
this method by generating
w
~ 0 = ~v0 /|~v0 |
~v1 = T w
~0
w
~ 1 = ~v1 /|~v1 |
~v2 = T w
~2
..
.
w
~ k‚àí1 = ~vk‚àí1 /|~vk‚àí1 |
~vk = T w
~k
until we are satisfied. Then ~vk is an approximation of an eigenvector, and
the approximation of the dominant eigenvalue is the ratio (T ‚Ä¢ ~vk )/(~vk ‚Ä¢ ~vk ) ‚âà
(Œª1~vk ¬∑ ~vk )/(~vk ‚Ä¢ ~vk ) = Œª1 .
One way that we could be ‚Äòsatisfied‚Äô is to iterate until our approximation of
the eigenvalue settles down. We could decide for instance to stop the iteration
process not after some fixed number of steps, but instead when |~vk | differs from
|~vk‚àí1 | by less than one percent, or when they agree up to the second significant
digit.
The rate of convergence is determined by the rate at which the powers of
|Œª2 /Œª1 | go to zero, where Œª2 is the eigenvalue of second largest length. If that
ratio is much less than one then convergence is fast but if it is only slightly
less than one then convergence can be quite slow. Consequently, the method
of powers is not the most commonly used way of finding eigenvalues (although
it is the simplest one, which is why it is here). Instead, there are a variety of
methods that generally work by first replacing the given matrix T with another
that is similar to it and so has the same eigenvalues, but is in some reduced form

448

Chapter Five. Similarity

such as tridiagonal form, where the only nonzero entries are on the diagonal, or
just above or below it. Then special case techniques can find the eigenvalues.
Once we know the eigenvalues then we can easily compute the eigenvectors of T .
These other methods are outside of our scope. A good reference is [Goult, et al.]

Stable Populations
Imagine a reserve park with animals from a species that we are protecting. The
park doesn‚Äôt have a fence so animals cross the boundary, both from the inside
out and from the outside in. Every year, 10% of the animals from inside of the
park leave and 1% of the animals from the outside find their way in. Can we
reach a stable level; are there populations for the park and the rest of the world
that will stay constant over time, with the number of animals leaving equal to
the number of animals entering?
Let pn be the year n population in the park and let rn be the population in
the rest of the world.
pn+1 = .90pn + .01rn
rn+1 = .10pn + .99rn
We have this matrix equation.

The population will be stable if pn+1 = pn and rn+1 = rn so that the matrix
equation ~vn+1 = T~vn becomes ~v = T~v. We are therefore looking for eigenvectors
for T that are associated with the eigenvalue Œª = 1. The equation ~0 = (ŒªI‚àíT )~v =
(I ‚àí T )~v is

and gives the eigenspace of vectors with the restriction that p = .1r. For
example, if we start with a park population p = 10 000 animals and a rest of the
world population of r = 100 000 animals then every year ten percent of those
inside leave the park (this is a thousand animals), and every year one percent of
those from the rest of the world enter the park (also a thousand animals). The
population is stable, self-sustaining.

Topic: Stable Populations

451

Now imagine that we are trying to raise the total world population of this
species. We are trying to have the world population grow at 1% per year.
This makes the population level stable in some sense, although it is a dynamic
stability, in contrast to the static population level of the Œª = 1 case. The equation
~vn+1 = 1.01 ¬∑ ~vn = T~vn leads to ((1.01I ‚àí T )~v = ~0, which gives this system.

This matrix is nonsingular and so the only solution is p = 0, r = 0. Thus there is
no nontrivial initial population that would lead to a regular annual one percent
growth rate in p and r.
We can look for the rates that allow an initial population for the park that
results in a steady growth behavior. We consider Œª~v = T~v and solve for Œª.
0=

Œª ‚àí .9

= (Œª ‚àí .9)(Œª ‚àí .99) ‚àí (.10)(.01) = Œª2 ‚àí 1.89Œª + .89
Œª ‚àí .99

We already know that Œª = 1 is one solution of this characteristic equation. The
other is 0.89. Thus there are two ways to have a dynamically stable p and r,
where the two grow at the same rate despite the leaky park boundaries: have a
world population that is does not grow or shrink, and have a world population
that shrinks by 11% every year.
So one way to look at eigenvalues and eigenvectors is that they give a stable
state for a system. If the eigenvalue is one then the system is static and if the
eigenvalue isn‚Äôt one then it is a dynamic stability.
Exercises
1 For the park discussed above, what should be the initial park population in the
case where the populations decline by 11% every year?
2 What will happen to the population of the park in the event of a growth in world
population of 1% per year? Will it lag the world growth, or lead it? Assume
that the initial park population is ten thousand, and the world population is one
hundred thousand, and calculate over a ten year span.
3 The park discussed above is partially fenced so that now, every year, only 5% of
the animals from inside of the park leave (still, about 1% of the animals from the
outside find their way in). Under what conditions can the park maintain a stable
population now?
4 Suppose that a species of bird only lives in Canada, the United States, or in Mexico.
Every year, 4% of the Canadian birds travel to the US, and 1% of them travel to
Mexico. Every year, 6% of the US birds travel to Canada, and 4% go to Mexico.
From Mexico, every year 10% travel to the US, and 0% go to Canada.
(a) Give the transition matrix.
(b) Is there a way for the three countries to have constant populations?

Page Ranking
Imagine that you are looking for the best book on Linear Algebra. You probably
would try a web search engine such as Google. These lists pages ranked by importance. The ranking is defined, as Google‚Äôs founders have said in [Brin & Page],
that a page is important if other important pages link to it: ‚Äúa page can have
a high PageRank if there are many pages that point to it, or if there are some
pages that point to it and have a high PageRank.‚Äù But isn‚Äôt that circular ‚Äî
how can they tell whether a page is important without first deciding on the
important pages? With eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
We will present a simplified version of the Page Rank algorithm. For that
we will model the World Wide Web as a collection of pages connected by links.
This diagram, from [Wills], shows the pages as circles, and the links as arrows;
for instance, page p1 has a link to page p2 .

p1

p2

p4

p3

The key idea is that pages that should be highly ranked if they are cited often
by other pages. That is, we raise the importance of a page pi if it is linked-to
from page pj . The increment depends on the importance of the linking page pj
divided by how many out-links aj are on that page.
I(pi ) =

The algorithm‚Äôs inventors describe a way to think about that matrix.
PageRank can be thought of as a model of user behavior. We
assume there is a ‚Äòrandom surfer‚Äô who is given a web page at random
and keeps clicking on links, never hitting ‚Äúback‚Äù . . . The probability
that the random surfer visits a page is its PageRank. [Brin & Page]
In the diagram, a surfer on page p3 has a probability 1/3 of going next to each
of the other pages.
That leads us to the problem of page p4 . Many pages are dangling or sink
links, without any outbound links. The simplest model of what happens here is
to imagine that the surfer goes to a next page entirely at random.

We will find vector ~I whose components are the importance rankings of each
page I(pi ). With this notation, our requirements for the page rank are that
H~I = ~I. That is, we want an eigenvector of the matrix associated with the
eigenvalue Œª = 1.
Here is Sage‚Äôs calculation of the eigenvectors (slightly edited to fit on the
page).
sage: H=matrix([[0,0,1/3,1/4], [1,0,1/3,1/4], [0,1,0,1/4], [0,0,1/3,1/4]])
sage: H.eigenvectors_right()
[(1, [
(1, 2, 9/4, 1)

(0, 1, 3, -4)

[(1, -0.1250000000000000? + 1.316956719106593?*I,
-1.875000000000000? - 1.316956719106593?*I, 1)], 1),

Of course, there are many vectors in that eigenspace. To get a page rank number
we normalize to length one.
sage: v=vector([1, 2, 9/4, 1])

So we rank the first and fourth pages as of equal importance. We rank the
second and third pages as much more important than those, and about equal in
importance as each other.

Linear Recurrences
In 1202 Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, posed this problem.
A certain man put a pair of rabbits in a place surrounded on all sides
by a wall. How many pairs of rabbits can be produced from that
pair in a year if it is supposed that every month each pair begets a
new pair which from the second month on becomes productive?
This moves past an elementary exponential growth model for populations to
include that newborns are not fertile for some period, here a month. However,
it retains other simplifying assumptions such as that there is an age after which
the rabbits are infertile.
To get next month‚Äôs total number of pairs we add the number of pairs alive
going into next month to the number of pairs that will be newly born next
month. The latter equals the number of pairs that will be productive going into
next month, which is the number that next month will have been alive for at
least two months.
where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1

On the left is a recurrence relation. It gets that name because F recurs in its
own defining equation. On the right are the initial conditions. From (‚àó) we can

Write T for the matrix and ~vn for the vector with components F(n) and F(n ‚àí 1)
so that ~vn = T n‚àí1~v1 for n > 1. If we diagonalize T then we have a fast way
to compute its powers: where T = PDP‚àí1 then T n = PDn P‚àí1 and the n-th
power of the diagonal matrix D is the diagonal matrix whose entries are the
n-th powers of the entries of D.

Because (1 ‚àí 5)/2 ‚âà ‚àí0.618 has absolute value less than one, its powers

have extended the elementary model of population growth by adding a delay
period before the onset of fertility, we nonetheless still get a function that is
asymptotically exponential.
In general, a homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order k has this
form.
f(n) = an‚àí1 f(n ‚àí 1) + an‚àí2 f(n ‚àí 2) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an‚àík f(n ‚àí k)
This recurrence relation is homogeneous because it has no constant term, i.e, we
can rewrite it as 0 = ‚àíf(n) + an‚àí1 f(n ‚àí 1) + an‚àí2 f(n ‚àí 2) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an‚àík f(n ‚àí k).
It is of order k because it uses k-many prior terms to calculate f(n). The relation,
cimbined with initial conditions giving values for f(0), . . . , f(k ‚àí 1), completely
determines a sequence, simply because we can compute f(n) by first computing
f(k), f(k + 1), etc. As with the Fibonacci case we will find a formula that solves
the recurrence, that directly gives f(n)
Let V be the set of functions with domain N = { 0, 1, 2, . . . } and codomain
C. (Where convenient we sometimes use the domain Z+ = {1, 2, . . . }.) This is
a vector space under the usual meaning for addition and scalar multiplication,
that f + g is the map x 7‚Üí f(x) + g(x) and cf is the map x 7‚Üí c ¬∑ f(x).
If we put aside any initial conditions and look only at the recurrence, then
there may be many functions satisfying the relation. For example, the Fibonacci
recurrence that each value beyond the initial ones is the sum of the prior two is
satisfied by the function L whose first few values are L(0) = 2, L(1) = 1, L(2) = 3,
L(3) = 4, and L(4) = 7.
Fix a homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order k and consider the
subset S of functions satisfying the relation (without initial conditions). This S
is a subspace of V. It is nonempty because the zero function is a solution, by
homogeneity. It is closed under addition because if f1 and f2 are solutions then
this holds.

Exercise 4 shows that this is linear. Any solution of the recurrence is uniquely
determined by the k-many initial conditions so this map is one-to-one and onto.
Thus it is an isomorphism, and S has dimension k.
So we can describe the set of solutions of our linear homogeneous recurrence
relation of order k by finding a basis consisting of k-many linearly independent
functions. To produce those we give the recurrence a matrix formulation.

The ¬± is not relevant to find the roots so we drop it. We say that the polynomial
‚àíŒªk + an‚àí1 Œªk‚àí1 + an‚àí2 Œªk‚àí2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an‚àík+1 Œª + an‚àík is associated with the
recurrence relation.
If the characteristic equation has no repeated roots then the matrix is
diagonalizable and we can, in theory, get a formula for f(n), as in the Fibonacci
case. But because we know that the subspace of solutions has dimension k we
do not need to do the diagonalization calculation, provided that we can exhibit
k different linearly independent functions satisfying the relation.
Where r1 , r2 , . . . , rk are the distinct roots, consider the functions of powers
n
of those roots, fr1 (n) = rn
1 through frk (n) = rk . Exercise 6 shows that each is
a solution of the recurrence and that they form a linearly independent set. So, if
the roots of the associated polynomial are distinct, any solution of the relation
n
n
has the form f(n) = c1 rn
1 + c2 r2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + ck rk for some scalars c1 , . . . , cn . (The
case of repeated roots is similar but we won‚Äôt cover it here; see any text on
Discrete Mathematics.)
Now we bring in the initial conditions. Use them to solve for c1 , . . . , cn . For
instance, the polynomial associated with the Fibonacci relation is ‚àíŒª2 + Œª + 1,
‚àö
‚àö
whose roots are r1 = (1 + 5)/2 and r2 = (1 ‚àí 5)/2 and so any solution of the
‚àö
‚àö
Fibonacci recurrence has the form f(n) = c1 ((1 + 5)/2)n + c2 ((1 ‚àí 5)/2)n .
Use the Fibonacci initial conditions for n = 0 and n = 1
c1 +
c2 = 0
‚àö
‚àö
(1 + 5/2)c1 + (1 ‚àí 5/2)c2 = 1
‚àö
‚àö
and solve to get c1 = 1/ 5 and c2 = ‚àí1/ 5, as we found above.
We close by considering the nonhomogeneous case, where the relation has
the form f(n + 1) = an f(n) + an‚àí1 f(n ‚àí 1) + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an‚àík f(n ‚àí k) + b for some
nonzero b. We only need a small adjustment to make the transition from the
homogeneous case.
This classic example illustrates: in 1883, Edouard Lucas posed the Tower of
Hanoi problem.
In the great temple at Benares, beneath the dome which marks
the center of the world, rests a brass plate in which are fixed three
diamond needles, each a cubit high and as thick as the body of a
bee. On one of these needles, at the creation, God placed sixty four
disks of pure gold, the largest disk resting on the brass plate, and
the others getting smaller and smaller up to the top one. This is the
Tower of Brahma. Day and night unceasingly the priests transfer
the disks from one diamond needle to another according to the fixed
and immutable laws of Bram-ah, which require that the priest on
duty must not move more than one disk at a time and that he must

461

Topic: Linear Recurrences
place this disk on a needle so that there is no smaller disk below
it. When the sixty-four disks shall have been thus transferred from
the needle on which at the creation God placed them to one of the
other needles, tower, temple, and Brahmins alike will crumble into
dusk, and with a thunderclap the world will vanish. (Translation of
[De Parville] from [Ball & Coxeter].)

We put aside the question of why the priests don‚Äôt sit down for a while and
have the world last a little longer, and instead ask how many disk moves it will
take. Before tackling the sixty four disk problem we will consider the problem
for three disks.
To begin, all three disks are on the same needle.

After the three moves of taking the small disk to the far needle, the mid-sized
disk to the middle needle, and then the small disk to the middle needle, we have
this.

Now we can move the big disk to the far needle. Then to finish we repeat the
three-move process on the two smaller disks, this time so that they end up on
the third needle, on top of the big disk.
That sequence of moves is the best that we can do. To move the bottom disk
at a minimum we must first move the smaller disks to the middle needle, then
move the big one, and then move all the smaller ones from the middle needle to
the ending needle. Since this minimum suffices, we get this recurrence.
T (n) = T (n ‚àí 1) + 1 + T (n ‚àí 1) = 2T (n ‚àí 1) + 1

where T (1) = 1

Of course, these numbers are one less than a power of two. To derive this write

a linear homogeneous recurrence of order 1. Its associated polynomial is ‚àíŒª + 2,
with the single root r1 = 2. Thus functions satisfying the homogeneous relation
take the form c1 2n .
That‚Äôs the homogeneous solution. Now we need a particular solution. Because
the nonhomogeneous relation ‚àí1 = ‚àíT (n) + 2T (n ‚àí 1) is so simple, we can
by eye spot a particular solution T (n) = ‚àí1. Any solution of the recurrence
T (n) = 2T (n ‚àí 1) + 1 (without initial conditions) is the sum of the homogeneous
solution and the particular solution: c1 2n ‚àí1. Now the initial condition T (1) = 1
gives that c1 = 1 and we‚Äôve gotten the formula that generates the table: the
n-disk Tower of Hanoi problem requires T (n) = 2n ‚àí 1 moves.
Finding a particular solution in more complicated cases is, perhaps not
surprisingly, more complicated. A delightful and rewarding, but challenging,
source is [Graham, Knuth, Patashnik]. For more on the Tower of Hanoi see

Coupled Oscillators
This is a Wilberforce pendulum. Hanging on the spring is a mass, or bob. Push
it up a bit and release, and it will oscillate up and down.

But then, if the device is properly adjusted, something fascinating happens.
After a few seconds, in addition to going up and down, the mass begins to
rotate, to spin about the axis of the spring. This yaw increases until the mass‚Äôs
motion becomes almost entirely rotary, with very little up and down. Perhaps
five seconds later the motion evolves back to a combination. After some more
time, order reappears. Amazingly, now the motion is almost entirely vertical.
This continues, with the device trading off periods of pure vertical motion with
periods of pure rotational motion, interspersed with mixtures. (Search online
for ‚Äúwilberforce pendulum video‚Äù to get some excellent demonstrations.)
Each pure motion state is a normal mode of oscillation. We will analyze
this device‚Äôs behavior when it is in a normal mode. It is all about eigenvalues.

x(t)
Œ∏(t)

Write x(t) for the vertical motion over time and Œ∏(t) for the rotational motion.
Fix the coordinate system so that in rest position x = 0 and Œ∏ = 0, so that
positive x‚Äôs are up, and so that positive Œ∏‚Äôs are counterclockwise when viewed
from above.

Topic: Coupled Oscillators

We start by modeling the motion of a mass on a spring constrained to have
no twist. This is simpler because there is only one motion, one degree of freedom.
Put the mass in rest position and push it up to compress the spring. Hooke‚Äôs
Law is that for small distances the restoring force is proportional to the distance,
F = ‚àík ¬∑ x. The constant k is the stiffness of the spring.
Newton‚Äôs Law is that a force is proportional to the associated acceleration
F = m ¬∑ d2 x(t)/dt. The constant of proportionality, m, is the mass of the
object. Combining Hooke‚Äôs Law with Newton‚Äôs gives the differential equation
expressing the mass‚Äôs motion m ¬∑ d2 x(t)/dt = ‚àík ¬∑ x(t). We prefer the from
with the variables all on one side.
m¬∑

+ k ¬∑ x(t) = 0

(‚àó)

Our physical intuition is that over time the bob oscillates. It started high so
the graph should look like this.

position x
time t
Of course, this looks like a cosine graph and we recognize that the
p differential
equation of motion (‚àó) is satisfied by x(t) = cos œât, where œâ = m/k, since
dx/dt = œâ ¬∑ sin œât and d2 x/dt2 = ‚àíœâ2 ¬∑ cos œât. Here, œâ is the angular
frequency. It governs the period of the oscillation since if œâ = 1 then the period
is 2œÄ, while if œâ = 2 then the period is œÄ, etc.
We can give a more general solution of (‚àó). For a general amplitude we put
a factor A in front x(t) = A ¬∑ cos wt. And we can allow a phase shift, so we are
not required to start the clock when the mass is high, with x(t) = A cos(wt + œÜ).
This is the equation of simple harmonic motion.
Now back to consideration of the coupled pair of motions, vertical and
rotational. These two interact because a spring that is twisted will lengthen
or shorten just a bit; for instance, it could work as here or could be reversed,
depending on the spring.

spring lengthens

spring shortens

And, a spring that is stretched or compressed from its rest position will twist
slightly. The interaction of the two produces coupled oscillations.

466

Chapter Five. Similarity

To see how the interaction can produce the dramatic behavior that we see in
a normal mode imagine that the mass is rotating in the direction that will will
make the spring longer. If at the same moment the vertical motion is that the
spring is getting shorter, then superimposing the two could result in their almost
canceling. The bob ends up not moving vertically much at all, just twisting.
With a properly adjusted device this could last for a number of seconds.
‚ÄúProperly adjusted‚Äù means that the period of the pure vertical motion is the
same as, or close to, the period of the pure rotational motion. With that, the
cancellation will go on for some time.
The interaction between the motions can also produce the other normal
mode behavior, where the bob moves mostly vertically without much rotation,
if the spring‚Äôs motion x(t) produces a twist that opposes the bob‚Äôs twist Œ∏(t).
The bob will stop rotating, almost, so that its motion is almost entirely vertical.
To get the equations of motion in this two degrees of freedom case, we make
the same assumption as in the one degree case, that for small displacements
the restoring force is proportional to the displacement. But now we take that
assumption both for the vertical motion and for the rotation. Let the constant
of proportionality in the rotational motion be Œ∫. Similarly we also use Newton‚Äôs
Law that force is proportional to acceleration for the rotational motion as well,
and take the constant of proportionality to be I.
Most crucially, we add a coupling between the two motions, which we take
to be proportional to each, with constant of proportionality /2.
That gives a system of two differential equations, the first for vertical motion
and the second for rotation. These equations describe the behavior of the coupled
system at any time t.

(‚àó‚àó)

We will use them to analyze the system‚Äôs behavior at times when it is in a
normal mode.
First consider the uncoupled motions, as given by the equations without the
 terms. Without those terms these describe simple harmonic functions, and
we write œâ2x for k/m, and œâ2Œ∏ for Œ∫/I. We have argued above that to observe
the stand-still behavior we should adjust the device so that the periods are the
same œâ2x = œâ2Œ∏ . Write œâ0 for that number.
Now consider the coupled motions x(t) and Œ∏(t). By the same principle, to
observe the stand-still behavior we want them in in sync, for instance so that
the rotation is at its peak when the stretch is at its peak. That is, in a normal
mode the oscillations have the same angular frequency œâ. As to phase shift, as

467

Topic: Coupled Oscillators

we also discussed there are two cases: when the twist imparted by the spring‚Äôs
motion is in the same direction as the twist given by the rotational oscillation
and when they are opposed. In either case to get a normal mode the peaks must
coincide.
x(t) = A1 cos(œât + œÜ)

x(t) = A1 cos(œât + œÜ)

Œ∏(t) = A2 cos(œât + œÜ)

Œ∏(t) = A2 cos(œât + (œÜ + œÄ))

We will work through the left-hand case, leaving the other as an exercise.
We want to find which œâ‚Äôs are possible. Take the second derivatives
d2 Œ∏(t)
= ‚àíA2 œâ2 cos(œât + œÜ)

d2 x(t)

Although the argument is beyond our scope, the general formula for the
motion of the pendulum is a linear combination of the motions during the normal
modes. Thus, the pendulum‚Äôs motion is entirely determined by the eigenvalues
of the above matrix. See [Berg & Marshall].

4 Build a Wilberforce pendulum out of a Slinky Jr and a soup can. You can drill
holes in the can for bolts, either two or four of them, that you can use to adjust
the moment of inertia of the can so the periods of vertical and rotational motion
coincide.

Appendix
Mathematics is made of arguments (reasoned discourse that is, not crockerythrowing). This section sketches the background material and argument techniques that we use in the book.
This section informally outlines the topics, skipping proofs. For more,
[Velleman2] is excellent. Two other sources, available online, are [Hefferon]
and [Beck].

Statements
Formal mathematical statements come labelled as a Theorem for major points,
a Corollary for results that follow immediately from a prior one, or a Lemma
for results chiefly used to prove others.
Statements can be complex and have many parts. The truth or falsity of the
entire statement depends both on the truth value of the parts and on how the
statement is put together.
Not Where P is a proposition, ‚Äòit is not the case that P‚Äô is true provided that
P is false. For instance, ‚Äòn is not prime‚Äô is true only when n is the product of
smaller integers.
To prove that a ‚Äònot P‚Äô statement holds, show that P is false.
And For a statement of the form ‚ÄòP and Q‚Äô to be true both halves must hold:
‚Äò7 is prime and so is 3‚Äô is true, while ‚Äò7 is prime and 3 is not‚Äô is false.
To prove a ‚ÄòP and Q‚Äô, prove each half.
Or A ‚ÄòP or Q‚Äô statement is true when either half holds: ‚Äò7 is prime or 4 is prime‚Äô
is true, while ‚Äò8 is prime or 4 is prime‚Äô is false. In the case that both clauses of
the statement are true, as in ‚Äò7 is prime or 3 is prime‚Äô, we take the statement
as a whole to be true. (In everyday speech people occasionally use ‚Äòor‚Äô in an
exclusive way ‚Äî ‚ÄúLive free or die‚Äù does not intend both halves to hold ‚Äî but we
will not use ‚Äòor‚Äô in that way.)

A-2
To prove ‚ÄòP or Q‚Äô, show that in all cases at least one half holds (perhaps
sometimes one half and sometimes the other, but always at least one).
If-then An ‚Äòif P then Q‚Äô statement may also appear as ‚ÄòP implies Q‚Äô or ‚ÄòP =‚áí Q‚Äô
or ‚ÄòP is sufficient to give Q‚Äô or ‚ÄòQ if P‚Äô. It is true unless P is true while Q is
false. Thus ‚Äòif 7 is prime then 4 is not‚Äô is true while ‚Äòif 7 is prime then 4 is also
prime‚Äô is false. (Contrary to its use in casual speech, in mathematics ‚Äòif P then
Q‚Äô does not connote that P precedes Q or causes Q.)
Note this consequence of the prior paragraph: if P is false then ‚Äòif P then Q‚Äô
is true irrespective of the value of Q: ‚Äòif 4 is prime then 7 is prime‚Äô and ‚Äòif 4 is
prime then 7 is not‚Äô are both true statements. (They are vacuously true.) Also
observe that ‚Äòif P then Q‚Äô is true when Q is true: ‚Äòif 4 is prime then 7 is prime‚Äô
and ‚Äòif 4 is not prime then 7 is prime‚Äô are both true.
There are two main ways to establish an implication. The first way is
direct: assume that P is true and use that assumption to prove Q. For instance,
to show ‚Äòif a number is divisible by 5 then twice that number is divisible by
10‚Äô we can assume that the number is 5n and deduce that 2(5n) = 10n. The
indirect way is to prove the contrapositive statement: ‚Äòif Q is false then P is
false‚Äô (rephrased, ‚ÄòQ can only be false when P is also false‚Äô). Thus to show ‚Äòif a
natural number is prime then it is not a perfect square‚Äô we can argue that if it
were a square p = n2 then it could be factored p = n ¬∑ n where n < p and so
wouldn‚Äôt be prime (p = 0 or p = 1 don‚Äôt satisfy n < p but they are nonprime).
Equivalent statements Sometimes, not only does P imply Q but also Q implies P.
Some ways to say this are: ‚ÄòP if and only if Q‚Äô, ‚ÄòP iff Q‚Äô, ‚ÄòP and Q are logically
equivalent‚Äô, ‚ÄòP is necessary and sufficient to give Q‚Äô, ‚ÄòP ‚áê‚áí Q‚Äô. An example is
‚Äòan integer is divisible by ten if and only if that number ends in 0‚Äô.
Although in simple arguments a chain like ‚ÄúP if and only if R, which holds if
and only if S . . . ‚Äù may be practical, to prove that statements are equivalent we
more often prove the two halves ‚Äòif P then Q‚Äô and ‚Äòif Q then P‚Äô separately.

Quantifiers
Compare these statements about natural numbers: ‚Äòthere is a natural number x
such that x is divisible by x2 ‚Äô is true, while ‚Äòfor all natural numbers x, that x is
divisible by x2 ‚Äô is false. The prefixes ‚Äòthere is‚Äô and ‚Äòfor all‚Äô are quantifiers.
For all The ‚Äòfor all‚Äô prefix is the universal quantifier, symbolized ‚àÄ.
The most straightforward way to prove that a statement holds in all cases is
to prove that it holds in each case. Thus to show that ‚Äòevery number divisible by
p has its square divisible by p2 ‚Äô, take a single number of the form pn and square
it (pn)2 = p2 n2 . This is a typical element proof. (In this kind of argument
be careful not to assume properties for that element other than the ones in the

A-3
hypothesis. This argument is wrong: ‚ÄúIf n is divisible by a prime, say 2, so that
n = 2k for some natural number k, then n2 = (2k)2 = 4k2 and the square of n
is divisible by the square of the prime.‚Äù That is a proof for the special case p = 2
but it isn‚Äôt a proof for all p. Contrast it with a correct one: ‚ÄúIf n is divisible
by a prime so that n = pk for some natural number k then n2 = (pk)2 = p2 k2
and so the square of n is divisible by the square of the prime.‚Äù)
There exists The ‚Äòthere exists‚Äô prefix is the existential quantifier, symbolized ‚àÉ.
We can prove an existence proposition by producing something satisfying
5
the property: for instance, to settle the question of primality of 22 + 1, Euler
exhibited the divisor 641[Sandifer]. But there are proofs showing that something
exists without saying how to find it; Euclid‚Äôs argument given in the next
subsection shows there are infinitely many primes without giving a formula
naming them.
Finally, after ‚ÄúAre there any?‚Äù we often ask ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù That is, the
question of uniqueness often arises in conjunction with the question of existence.
Sometimes the two arguments are simpler if separated so note that just as
proving something exists does not show that it is unique, neither does proving
that something is unique show that it exists.

Techniques of Proof
We have many ways to prove mathematical statements. Here we will outline
two techniques that we use often, and that might not come naturally, even to a
person with a technical turn of mind.
Induction Many proofs are iterative, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs why the statement is true for the
number 0, it then follows for 1 and from there to 2 . . . ‚Äù. These are proofs by
mathematical induction. We will see two examples.
We will first prove that 1 + 2 + 3 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + n = n(n + 1)/2. That formula has
a natural number variable n that is free, meaning that setting n to be 1, or
2, etc., gives a family of cases of the statement: first that 1 = 1(2)/2, second
that 1 + 2 = 2(3)/2, etc. Our induction proofs involve statements with one free
natural number variable.
Each such proof has two steps. In the base step we show that the statement
holds for some intial number i ‚àà N. Often this step is a routine verification.
The second step, the inductive step, is more subtle; we will show that this
implication holds:
If the statement holds from n = i up to and including n = k
then the statement holds also in the n = k + 1 case

(‚àó)

(the first line is the inductive hypothesis). Completing both steps proves that
the statement is true for all natural numbers greater than or equal to i.

A-4
For the sum of the initial n numbers statement the intuition behind the
principle is that first, the base step directly verifies the statement for the case
of the initial number n = 1. Then, because the inductive step verifies the
implication (‚àó) for all k, that implication applied to k = 1 gives that the
statement is true for the case of the number n = 2. Now, with the statement
established for both 1 and 2, apply (‚àó) again to conclude that the statement is
true for the number n = 3. In this way, we bootstrap to all numbers n > 1.
Here is a proof of 1 + 2 + 3 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + n = n(n + 1)/2, with separate paragraphs
for the base step and the inductive step.
For the base step we show that the formula holds when n = 1. That‚Äôs
easy; the sum of the first 1 natural number equals 1(1 + 1)/2.
For the inductive step, assume the inductive hypothesis that the formula
holds for the numbers n = 1, n = 2, . . . , n = k with k > 1. That is,
assume 1 = 1(1)/2, and 1 + 2 = 2(3)/2, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 3(4)/2, through
1 + 2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + k = k(k + 1)/2. With that, the formula holds also in the
n = k + 1 case:
1 + 2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + k + (k + 1) =

k(k + 1)
(k + 1)(k + 2)
+ (k + 1) =
2
2

(the first equality follows from the inductive hypothesis).

Here is another example, proving that every integer greater than or equal to
2 is a product of primes.
The base step is easy: 2 is the product of a single prime.
For the inductive step assume that each of 2, 3, . . . , k is a product of primes,
aiming to show k+1 is also a product of primes. There are two possibilities.
First, if k + 1 is not divisible by a number smaller than itself then it is a
prime and so is the product of primes. The second possibility is that k + 1
is divisible by a number smaller than itself, and then by the inductive
hypothesis its factors can be written as a product of primes. In either case
k + 1 can be rewritten as a product of primes.

Contradiction Another technique of proof is to show that something is true by
showing that it cannot be false. A proof by contradiction assumes that the
proposition is false and derives some contradiction to known facts.
The classic example of proof by contradiction is Euclid‚Äôs argument that there
are infinitely many primes.
Suppose that there are only finitely many primes p1 , . . . , pk . Consider the
number p1 ¬∑ p2 . . . pk + 1. None of the primes on the supposedly exhaustive
list divides this number evenly since each leaves a remainder of 1. But
every number is a product of primes so this can‚Äôt be. Therefore there
cannot be only finitely many primes.

A-5
Another example is this proof that

‚àö
2 is not a rational number.

‚àö
Suppose that 2 = m/n, so that 2n2 = m2 . Factor out any 2‚Äôs, giving
n = 2kn ¬∑ nÃÇ and m = 2km ¬∑ mÃÇ. Rewrite.
2 ¬∑ (2kn ¬∑ nÃÇ)2 = (2km ¬∑ mÃÇ)2
The Prime Factorization Theorem says that there must be the same number
of factors of 2 on both sides, but there are an odd number of them 1 + 2kn
on the left and an even number 2km on the right. That‚Äôs a contradiction,
so a rational number with a square of 2 is impossible.

Sets, Functions, and Relations
The material here forms the backdrop, the vocabulary, for all of the development
that we do.
Sets Mathematicians often work with collections. The most commonly-used kind
of collection is a set. Sets are characterized by the Principle of Extensionality:
two sets with the same elements are equal. Because of this, the order of the
elements does not matter {2, œÄ } = {œÄ, 2 }, and repeats collapse { 7, 7 } = {7 }.
We can describe a set using a listing between curly braces {1, 4, 9, 16 } (as
in the prior paragraph), or by using set-builder notation {x | x5 ‚àí 3x3 + 2 = 0 }
(read ‚Äúthe set of all x such that . . . ‚Äù). We name sets with capital roman letters;
for instance the set of primes is P = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, . . . } (except that a few sets
are so important that their names are reserved, such as the real numbers R and
the complex numbers C). To denote that something is an element, or member,)
of a set we use ‚Äò‚àà‚Äô, so that 7 ‚àà {3, 5, 7 } while 8 6‚àà {3, 5, 7 }.
We say that A is a subset of B, written A ‚äÜ B, when x ‚àà A implies that
x ‚àà B. In this book we use ‚Äò‚äÇ‚Äô for the proper subset relationship that A is a
subset of B but A 6= B (some authors use this symbol for any kind of subset,
proper or not). An example is { 2, œÄ } ‚äÇ { 2, œÄ, 7 }. These symbols may be flipped,
for instance { 2, œÄ, 5 } ‚äÉ {2, 5 }.
Because of Extensionality, to prove that two sets are equal A = B show that
they have the same members. Often we do this by showing mutual inclusion,
that both A ‚äÜ B and A ‚äá B. Such a proof will have a part showing that if
x ‚àà A then x ‚àà B, and a second part showing that if x ‚àà B then x ‚àà A.
When a set has no members then it is the empty set { }, symbolized ‚àÖ.
Any set has the empty set for a subset by the ‚Äòvacuously true‚Äô property of the
definition of implication.
Diagrams We picture basic set operations with a Venn diagram. This shows
x ‚àà P.

The outer rectangle contains the universe ‚Ñ¶ of all objects under discussion. For
instance, in a statement about real numbers, the rectangle encloses all members

Multisets As described above, a set is a collection in which order does not matter,
so that the sets {2, œÄ } and {œÄ, 2 } are equal, and in which repeats collapse, so
that the sets { 7, 7 } and { 7 } are equal.

A-7
A collection that is like a set in that order does not matter, but in which
repeats do not collapse is a multiset. Thus the multiset {1, 2, 2 } differs from
the multiset { 1, 2 }. Because order does not matter, these multisets are all
equal: { 1, 2, 2 }, {2, 1, 2 }, and {2, 2, 1 }. (Note that we use the same curly brackets
notation { . . . } as for sets.) We only mention multisets in a remark so more, such
as how subsets work, or unions and intersections, is beyond our scope.
Sequences In addition to sets and multisets, we also use collections where order
matters and where repeats do not collapse. These are sequences, denoted with
angle brackets: h2, 3, 7i 6= h2, 7, 3i. A sequence of length 2 is an ordered pair,
and is often written with parentheses: (œÄ, 3). We also sometimes say ‚Äòordered
triple‚Äô, ‚Äòordered 4-tuple‚Äô, etc. The set of ordered n-tuples of elements of a set A
is denoted An . Thus R2 is the set of pairs of reals.
Functions A function or map f : D ‚Üí C is is an association between input
arguments x ‚àà D and output values f(x) ‚àà C subject to the the requirement that
the function must be well-defined, that x suffices to determine f(x). Restated,
the condition is that if x1 = x2 then f(x1 ) = f(x2 ).
The set of all arguments D is f‚Äôs domain and the set of output values is
its range R(f). Often we don‚Äôt work with the range and instead work with
a convenient superset, the codomain C. For instance, we might describe the
squaring function with s : R ‚Üí R instead of s : R ‚Üí R+ ‚à™ {0 }.
We picture functions with a bean diagram.

The blob on the left is the domain while on the right is the codomain. The
function associates the three points of the domain with three in the codomain.
Note that by the definition of a function every point in the domain is associated
with a unique point in the codomain, but the converse needn‚Äôt be true.
The association is arbitrary; no formula or algorithm is required, although in
this book there typically is one. We often use y to denote f(x). We also use the
f

notation x 7‚àí‚Üí 16x2 ‚àí 100, read ‚Äòx maps under f to 16x2 ‚àí 100‚Äô or ‚Äò16x2 ‚àí 100
is the image of x‚Äô.
A map such as x 7‚Üí sin(1/x) is a combinations of simpler maps, here g(y) =
sin(y) applied to the image of f(x) = 1/x. The composition of g : Y ‚Üí Z with
f : X ‚Üí Y, is the map sending x ‚àà X to g( f(x) ) ‚àà Z. It is denoted g ‚ó¶ f : X ‚Üí Z.
This definition only makes sense if the range of f is a subset of the domain of g.

A-8
An identity map id : Y ‚Üí Y defined by id(y) = y has the property that for
any f : X ‚Üí Y, the composition id ‚ó¶f is equal to f. So an identity map plays the
same role with respect to function composition that the number 0 plays in real
number addition or that 1 plays in multiplication.
In line with that analogy, we define a left inverse of a map f : X ‚Üí Y to be
a function g : range(f) ‚Üí X such that g ‚ó¶ f is the identity map on X. A right
inverse of f is a h : Y ‚Üí X such that f ‚ó¶ h is the identity.
For some f‚Äôs there is a map that is both a left and right inverse of f. If such
a map exists then it is unique because if both g1 and g2 have this property
then g1 (x) = g1 ‚ó¶ (f ‚ó¶ g2 ) (x) = (g1 ‚ó¶ f) ‚ó¶ g2 (x) = g2 (x) (the middle equality
comes from the associativity of function composition) so we call it a two-sided
inverse or just ‚Äúthe‚Äù inverse, and denote it f‚àí1 . For instance, the inverse of
the function f : R ‚Üí R given by f(x) = 2x ‚àí 3 is the function f‚àí1 : R ‚Üí R given
by f‚àí1 (x) = (x + 3)/2.
The superscript notation for function inverse ‚Äòf‚àí1 ‚Äô fits into a larger scheme.
Functions with the same codomain as domain f : X ‚Üí X can be iterated, so that
we can consider the composition of f with itself: f ‚ó¶ f, and f ‚ó¶ f ‚ó¶ f, etc. We write
f ‚ó¶ f as f2 and f ‚ó¶ f ‚ó¶ f as f3 , etc. Note that the familiar exponent rules for real
numbers hold: fi ‚ó¶ fj = fi+j and (fi )j = fi¬∑j . Then where f is invertible, writing
f‚àí1 for the inverse and f‚àí2 for the inverse of f2 , etc., gives that these familiar
exponent rules continue to hold, since we define f0 to be the identity map.
The definition of function requires that for every input there is one and only
one associated output value. If a function f : D ‚Üí C has the additional property
that for every output value there is at least one associated input value ‚Äî that is,
the additional property that f‚Äôs codomain equals its range C = R(f) ‚Äî then the
function is onto.

A function has a right inverse if and only if it is onto. (The f pictured above
has a right inverse g : C ‚Üí D given by following the arrows backwards, from
right to left. For the codomain point on the top, choose either one of the arrows
to follow. With that, applying g first followed by f takes elements y ‚àà C to
themselves, and so is the identity function.)
If a function f : D ‚Üí C has the property that for every output value there is
at most one associated input value ‚Äî that is, if no two arguments share an image
so that f(x1 ) = f(x2 ) implies that x1 = x2 ‚Äî then the function is one-to-one.
The bean diagram from earlier illustrates.

A-9

A function has a left inverse if and only if it is one-to-one. (In the picture define
g : C ‚Üí D to follow the arrows backwards for those y ‚àà C that are at the end of
an arrow, and to send the point to an arbitrary element in D otherwise. Then
applying f followed by g to elements of D will act as the identity.)
By the prior paragraphs, a map has a two-sided inverse if and only if that map
is both onto and one-to-one. Such a function is a correspondence. It associates
one and only one element of the domain with each element of the codomain.
Because a composition of one-to-one maps is one-to-one, and a composition of
onto maps is onto, a composition of correspondences is a correspondence.
We sometimes want to shrink the domain of a function. For instance, we
may take the function f : R ‚Üí R given by f(x) = x2 and, in order to have an
inverse, limit input arguments to nonnegative reals fÃÇ : R+ ‚à™ {0 } ‚Üí R. Then fÃÇ is
the restriction of f to the smaller domain.
Relations Some familiar mathematical things, such as ‚Äò<‚Äô or ‚Äò=‚Äô, are most
naturally understood as relations between things. A binary relation on a set
A is a set of ordered pairs of elements of A. For example, some elements of
the set that is the relation ‚Äò<‚Äô on the integers are (3, 5), (3, 7), and (1, 100).
Another binary relation on the integers is equality; this relation is the set
{. . . , (‚àí1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1), . . . }. Still another example is ‚Äòcloser than 10‚Äô, the set
{(x, y) | |x ‚àí y| < 10 }. Some members of this relation are (1, 10), (10, 1), and
(42, 44). Neither (11, 1) nor (1, 11) is a member.
Those examples illustrate the generality of the definition. All kinds of
relationships (e.g., ‚Äòboth numbers even‚Äô or ‚Äòfirst number is the second with the
digits reversed‚Äô) are covered.
Equivalence Relations We shall need to express that two objects are alike in
some way. They aren‚Äôt identical, but they are related (e.g., two integers that
give the same remainder when divided by 2).
A binary relation { (a, b), . . . } is an equivalence relation when it satisfies
(1) reflexivity: any object is related to itself, (2) symmetry: if a is related
to b then b is related to a, and (3) transitivity: if a is related to b and b is
related to c then a is related to c. Some examples (on the integers): ‚Äò=‚Äô is an
equivalence relation, ‚Äò<‚Äô does not satisfy symmetry, ‚Äòsame sign‚Äô is a equivalence,
while ‚Äònearer than 10‚Äô fails transitivity.
Partitions In the ‚Äòsame sign‚Äô relation {(1, 3), (‚àí5, ‚àí7), (0, 0), . . . } there are three

A-10
kinds of pairs, pairs with both numbers positive, pairs with both negative, and
the one pair with both zero. So integers fall into exactly one of three classes,
positive, or negative, or zero.
A partition of a set ‚Ñ¶ is a collection of subsets {S0 , S1 , S2 , . . . } such that
every element of S is an element of a subset S1 ‚à™ S2 ‚à™ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = ‚Ñ¶ and overlapping
parts are equal: if Si ‚à© Sj 6= ‚àÖ then Si = Sj . Picture that ‚Ñ¶ is decomposed into
non-overlapping parts.
S1
S0

S2

...

S3

Thus the prior paragraph says that ‚Äòsame sign‚Äô partitions the integers into the
set of positives, the set of negatives, and the set containing only zero. Similarly,
the equivalence relation ‚Äò=‚Äô partitions the integers into one-element sets.
Another example is the set of strings consisting of a number, followed by
a slash, followed by a nonzero number ‚Ñ¶ = {n/d | n, d ‚àà Z and d 6= 0 }. Define
Sn,d by: nÃÇ/dÃÇ ‚àà Sn,d if nÃÇd = ndÃÇ. Checking that this is a partition of ‚Ñ¶ is
routine (observe for instance that S4,3 = S8,6 ). This shows some parts, listing
in each a couple of its infinitely many members.
. 1/1 . ‚àí2 2/ ‚àí 4
. /4
. 2/2
. 0/1
...
. 0/3
. 4/3
. 8/6
Every equivalence relation induces a partition, and every partition is induced
by an equivalence. (This is routine to check.) Below are two examples.
Consider the equivalence relationship between two integers of ‚Äògives the same
remainder when divided by 2‚Äô, the set P = {(‚àí1, 3), (2, 4), (0, 0), . . . }. In the set P
are two kinds of pairs, the pairs with both members even and the pairs with both
members odd. This equivalence induces a partition where the parts are found
by: for each x we define the set of numbers related to it Sx = {y | (x, y) ‚àà P }.
The parts are { . . . , ‚àí3, ‚àí1, 1, 3, . . . } and {. . . , ‚àí2, 0, 2, 4, . . .}. Each part can be
named in many ways; for instance, { . . . , ‚àí3, ‚àí1, 1, 3, . . . } is S1 and also is S‚àí3 .
Now consider the partition of the natural numbers where two numbers are
in the same part if they leave the same remainder when divided by 10, that
is, if they have the same least significant digit. This partition is induced by
the equivalence relation R defined by: two numbers n, m are related if they
are together in the same part. For example, 3 is related to 33, but 3 is not

A-11
related to 102. Verifying the three conditions in the definition of equivalence
are straightforward.
We call each part of a partition an equivalence class. We sometimes pick a
single element of each equivalence class to be the class representative.

Usually when we pick representatives we have some natural scheme in mind. In
that case we call them the canonical representatives. An example is that two
fractions 3/5 and 9/15 are equivalent. In everyday work we often prefer to use
the ‚Äòsimplest form‚Äô or ‚Äòreduced form‚Äô fraction 3/5 as the class representative.
