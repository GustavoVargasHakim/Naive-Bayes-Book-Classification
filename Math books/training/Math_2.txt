Preface
A free and open-source calculus
As we have noted in the single-variable edition of Active Calculus, several fundamental ideas in
calculus are more than 2000 years old, and calculus as a formal subdiscipline of mathematics was
first introduced and developed in the late 1600s. Mathematicians agree that the subject has been
understood – rigorously and by experts – since the mid 1800s. The discipline is one of our great
human intellectual achievements.
While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative perspective on
the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas the author presents are new. Indeed, the
mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their
justification and their importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar.
As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century – an age where the internet permits seamless and
immediate transmission of information – no one should be required to purchase a calculus text
to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs
to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, a main purpose of this
work is to present a new multivariable calculus text that is free. In addition, instructors who are
looking for a multivariable calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files
and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is open-source.
Any professor or student may use an electronic version of the text for no charge. A .pdf copy
of the text may be obtained by download from the Active Calculus home page, or directly from
http://gvsu.edu/s/Wb.
Because the text is open-source, any instructor may acquire the full set of source files, by request
via email to Steve Schlicker.

Active Calculus - Multivariable: our goals
In Active Calculus - Multivariable, we endeavor to actively engage students in learning the subject
through an activity-driven approach in which the vast majority of the examples are completed by
students. Where many texts present a general theory of calculus followed by substantial collections of worked examples, we instead pose problems or situations, consider possibilities, and then
ask students to investigate and explore. Following key activities or examples, the presentation
normally includes some overall perspective and a brief synopsis of general trends or properties,
followed by formal statements of rules or theorems. While we often offer plausibility arguments
for such results, rarely do we include formal proofs. It is not the intent of this text for the instructor
or author to demonstrate to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent and true, but rather for
students to encounter these ideas in a supportive, leading manner that enables them to begin to
understand for themselves why calculus is both coherent and true.
This approach is consistent with the following goals:
• To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach, where learners strive to construct solutions and approaches to ideas on their own, with appropriate support through
questions posed, hints, and guidance from the instructor and text.
• To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in multivariable calculus are natural
and true. We strive to accomplish this by using specific cases to highlight the ideas for the
general situation using contexts that are common and familiar.
• To challenge students to acquire deep, personal understanding of multivariable calculus
through reading the text and completing preview activities on their own, through working
on activities in small groups in class, and through doing substantial exercises outside of class
time.
• To strengthen students’ written and oral communicating skills by having them write about
and explain aloud the key ideas of multivariable calculus.

vii

Features of the Text
Similar to the presentation of the single-variable Active Calculus, instructors and students alike
will find several consistent features in the presentation, including:
• Motivating Questions. At the start of each section, we list motivating questions that provide
motivation for why the following material is of interest to us. One goal of each section is to
answer each of the motivating questions.
• Preview Activities. Each section of the text begins with a short introduction, followed by
a preview activity. This brief reading and the preview activity are designed to foreshadow
the upcoming ideas in the remainder of the section; both the reading and preview activity
are intended to be accessible to students in advance of class, and indeed to be completed by
students before a day on which a particular section is to be considered.
• Activities. Every section in the text contains several activities. These are designed to engage students in an inquiry-based style that encourages them to construct solutions to key
examples on their own, working either individually or in small groups.
• Exercises. There are dozens of calculus texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises. Rather than repeat standard and routine exercises in this text, we recommend the use
of WeBWorK with its access to the National Problem Library and its many multivariable
calculus problems. In this text, there are a small number of challenging exercises in each section. Almost every such exercise has multiple parts, requires the student to connect several
key ideas, and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer
the questions and explain their findings. For instructors interested in a more conventional
source of exercises, consider the freely available text by Gilbert Strang of MIT, available in
.pdf format from the MIT open courseware site via http://gvsu.edu/s/bh.
• Graphics. As much as possible, we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually,
and to encourage students to do the same. Throughout the text, we use full-color graphics
to exemplify and magnify key ideas, and to use this graphical perspective alongside both
numerical and algebraic representations of calculus. The figures and the software to generate
them have been created by David Austin.
• Links to Java Applets. Many of the ideas of multivariable calculus are best understood
dynamically, and there are a number of applets referenced in the text that can be used by
instructors and students to assist in the investigations and demonstrations. The use of these
freely available applets is in accord with our philosophy that no one should be required to
purchase materials to learn calculus. We are indebted to everyone who allows their expertise
to be openly shared.
• Summary of Key Ideas. Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section; this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating
questions that began the section.

How to Use this Text
This text may be used as a stand-alone textbook for a standard multivariable calculus course or as
a supplement to a more traditional text.

Electronically
Because students and instructors alike have access to the book in .pdf format, there are several
advantages to the text over a traditional print text. One is that the text may be projected on a
screen in the classroom (or even better, on a whiteboard) and the instructor may reference ideas
in the text directly, add comments or notation or features to graphs, and indeed write right on
the text itself. Students can do likewise, choosing to print only whatever portions of the text are
needed for them. In addition, the electronic version of the text includes live html links to java
applets, so student and instructor alike may follow those links to additional resources that lie
outside the text itself. Finally, students can have access to a copy of the text anywhere they have
an internet-enabled device.

Activities Workbook
Each section of the text has a preview activity and at least three in-class activities embedded in the
discussion. As it is the expectation that students will complete all of these activities, it is ideal for
them to have room to work on them adjacent to the problem statements themselves. As a separate
document, we have compiled a workbook of activities that includes only the individual activity
prompts, along with space provided for students to write their responses. This workbook is the
one printing expense that students will almost certainly have to undertake, and is available upon
request to the authors.
There are also options in the source files for compiling the activities workbook with hints for
each activity, or even full solutions. These options can be engaged at the instructor’s discretion.

Community of Users
Because this text is free and open-source, we hope that as people use the text, they will contribute
corrections, suggestions, and new material. At this time, the best way to communicate typographical errors or suggestions for changes is by email to Matt Boelkins at boelkinm@gvsu.edu.
At Matt’s blog, http://opencalculus.wordpress.com/, we also share new developments,
post feedback received by email, and include other points of discussion; readers may post additional comments and feedback.

Multivariable and Vector Functions
9.1

Functions of Several Variables and Three Dimensional Space

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What is a function of several variables? What do we mean by the domain of a function of
several variables?
• How do we find the distance between two points in R3 ? What is the equation of a sphere
in R3 ?
• What is a trace of a function of two variables? What does a trace tell us about a function?
• What is a level curve of a function of two variables? What does a level curve tell us about a
function?

Introduction
Throughout our mathematical careers we have studied functions of a single variable. We define a
function of one variable as a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input. We analyze these
functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. In
this and following sections, we will study functions whose input is defined in terms of more than
one variable, and then analyze these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. We will see that many of the ideas from single variable calculus
translate well to functions of several variables, but we will have to make some adjustments as
well.
Preview Activity 9.1. When people buy a large ticket item like a car or a house, they often take
out a loan to make the purchase. The loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire
1

amount of the loan, plus interest, is paid. The monthly payment that the borrower has to make
depends on the amount P of money borrowed (called the principal), the duration t of the loan in
years, and the interest rate r. For example, if we borrow $18,000 to buy a car, the monthly payment
M that we need to make to pay off the loan is given by the formula
M=

Functions of Several Variables
Suppose we launch a projectile, using a golf club, a cannon, or some other device, from ground
level. Under ideal conditions (ignoring wind resistance, spin, or any other forces except the force
of gravity) the horizontal distance the object will travel depends on the initial velocity x the object
is given, and the angle y at which it is launched. If we let f represent the horizontal distance the
object travels (its range), then f is a function of the two variables x and y, and we represent f in
functional notation by
x2 sin(2y)
f (x, y) =
,
g
where g is the acceleration due to gravity.1
Definition 9.1. A function f of two independent variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair (x, y) in some set D exactly one real number f (x, y).

There is, of course, no reason to restrict ourselves to functions of only two variables—we can
use any number of variables we like. For example,
f (x, y, z) = x2 − 2xz + cos(y)
defines f as a function of the three variables x, y, and z. In general, a function of n independent
variables is a rule that assigns to an ordered n-tuple (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) in some set D exactly one real
number.
As with functions of a single variable, it is important to understand the set of inputs for which
the function is defined.
Definition 9.2. The domain of a function f is the set of all inputs at which the function is
defined.

Activity 9.1.
Identify the domain of each of the following functions. Draw a picture of each domain in the
x-y plane.
(a) f (x, y) = x2 + y 2

(b) f (x, y) = x2 + y 2
(c) Q(x, y) =

9.1. FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES AND THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE

Representing Functions of Two Variables
One of the techniques we use to study functions of one variable is to create a table of values. We
can do the same for functions of two variables, except that our tables will have to allow us to
keep track of both input variables. We can do this with a 2-dimensional table, where we list the
x-values down the first column and the y-values across the first row. Let f be the function defined
2
by f (x, y) = x sin(2y)
that gives the range of a projectile as a function of the initial velocity x and
g
launch angle y of the projectile. The value f (x, y) is then displayed in the location where the x row
intersects the y column, as shown in Table 9.3 (where we measure x in feet and y in radians).

Activity 9.2.
Complete the last row in Table 9.3 to provide the needed values of the function f .
C
If f is a function of a single variable x, then we define the graph of f to be the set of points of
the form (x, f (x)), where x is in the domain of f . We then plot these points using the coordinate
axes in order to visualize the graph. We can do a similar thing with functions of several variables.
Table 9.3 identifies points of the form (x, y, f (x, y)), and we define the graph of f to be the set of
these points.
Definition 9.3. The graph of a function f = f (x, y) is the set of points of the form (x, y, f (x, y)),
where the point (x, y) is in the domain of f .

We also often refer to the graph of a function f of two variables as the surface generated by
f . Points in the form (x, y, f (x, y)) are in three dimensions, so plotting these points takes a bit
more work than graphs of functions in two dimensions. To plot these three-dimensional points,
we need to set up a coordinate system with three mutually perpendicular axes – the x-axis, the

9.1. FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES AND THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE

5

y-axis, and the z-axis (called the coordinate axes). There are essentially two different ways we could
set up a 3D coordinate system, as shown in Figures 9.1 and 9.2; thus, before we can proceed, we
need to establish a convention.
z

Figure 9.1: A right hand system

Figure 9.2: A left hand system

The distinction between these two figures is subtle, but important. In the coordinate system
shown in 9.1, imagine that you are sitting on the positive z-axis next to the label “z.” Looking
down at the x- and y-axes, you see that the y-axis is obtained by rotating the x-axis by 90◦ in the
counterclockwise direction. Again sitting on the positive z-axis in Figure 9.2, you see that the y-axis
is obtained by rotating the x-axis by 90◦ in the clockwise direction.
We call the coordinate system in 9.1 a right-hand system; if we point the index finger of our right
hand along the positive x-axis and our middle finger along the positive y-axis, then our thumb
points in the direction of the positive z-axis. Following mathematical conventions, we choose to
use a right-hand system throughout this book.
Now that we have established a convention for a right hand system, we can draw a graph of
2
the range function defined by f (x, y) = x sin(2y)
. Note that the function f is continuous in both
g
variables, so when we plot these points in the right hand coordinate system, we can connect them
all to form a surface in 3-space. The graph of the range function f is shown in Figure 9.3.
There are many graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional surfaces.2 Since we
will be able to visualize graphs of functions of two variables, but not functions of more than two
variables, we will primarily deal with functions of two variables in this course. It is important to
note, however, that the techniques we develop apply to functions of any number of variables.
Notation: We let R2 denote the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers in the plane (two copies of
the real number system) and let R3 represent the set of all ordered triples of real numbers (which
constitutes three-space).

Some Standard Equations in Three-Space
In addition to graphing functions, we will also want to understand graphs of some simple equations in three dimensions. For example, in R2 , the graphs of the equations x = a and y = b, where
a and b are constants, are lines parallel to the coordinate axes. In the next activity we consider
their three-dimensional analogs.

Activity 9.3.
(a) Consider the set of points (x, y, z) that satisfy the equation x = 2. Describe this set as
best you can.
(b) Consider the set of points (x, y, z) that satisfy the equation y = −1. Describe this set as
best you can.
(c) Consider the set of points (x, y, z) that satisfy the equation z = 0. Describe this set as
best you can.
C
Activity 9.3 shows that the equations where one independent variable is constant lead to
planes parallel to ones that result from a pair of the coordinate axes. When we make the constant 0, we get the coordinate planes. The xy-plane satisfies z = 0, the xz-plane satisfies y = 0, and
the yz-plane satisfies z = 0 (see Figure 9.4).
On a related note, we define a circle in R2 as the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point.
In R3 , we call the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point a sphere. To find the equation of
a sphere, we need to understand how to calculate the distance between two points in three-space,
and we explore this idea in the next activity.

Activity 9.4.
Let P = (x0 , y0 , z0 ) and Q = (x1 , y1 , z1 ) be two points in R3 . These two points form opposite
vertices of a rectangular box whose sides are planes parallel to the coordinate planes as illus-

Figure 9.5: The distance formula in R3 .
(a) Consider one of the right triangles in the base of the box whose hypotenuse is shown as
the red line in Figure 9.5. What are the vertices of this triangle? Since this right triangle
lies in a plane, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find a formula for the length of
the hypotenuse of this triangle. Find such a formula, which will be in terms of x0 , y0 ,
x1 , and y1 .
(b) Now notice that the triangle whose hypotenuse is the blue segment connecting the
points P and Q with a leg as the hypotenuse of the triangle found in part (a) lies entirely in a plane, so we can again use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of its
hypotenuse. Explain why the length of this hypotenuse, which is the distance between
the points P and Q, is
p
(x1 − x0 )2 + (y1 − y0 )2 + (z1 − z0 )2 .
C

9.1. FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES AND THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE
The formula developed in Activity 9.4 is important to remember.
The distance between points P = (x0 , y0 , z0 ) and Q = (x1 , y1 , z1 ) (denoted as |P Q|) in R3 is
given by the formula
p
|P Q| = (x1 − x0 )2 + (y1 − y0 )2 + (z1 − z0 )2 .

Equation (9.2) can be used to derive the formula for a sphere centered at a point (x0 , y0 , z0 )
with radius r. Since the distance from any point (x, y, z) on such a sphere to the point (x0 , y0 , z0 )
is r, the point (x, y, z) will satisfy the equation
p
(x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 + (z − z0 )2 = r
Squaring both sides, we come to the standard equation for a sphere.
The equation of a sphere with center (x0 , y0 , z0 ) and radius r is
(x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 + (z − z0 )2 = r2 .
This makes sense if we compare this equation to its two-dimensional analogue, the equation
of a circle of radius r in the plane centered at (x0 , y0 ):
(x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 = r2 .

Traces
When we study functions of several variables we are often interested in how each individual variable affects the function in and of itself. In Preview Activity 9.1, we saw that the monthly payment
on an $18,000 loan depends on the interest rate and the duration of the loan. However, if we fix
the interest rate, the monthly payment depends only on the duration of the loan, and if we set the
duration the payment depends only on the interest rate. This idea of keeping one variable constant while we allow the other to change will be an important tool for us when studying functions
of several variables.
As another example, consider again the range function f defined by
f (x, y) =

x2 sin(2y)
g

where x is the initial velocity of an object in feet per second, y is the launch angle in radians, and g
is the acceleration due to gravity (32 feet per second squared). If we hold the launch angle constant
at y = 0.6 radians, we can consider f a function of the initial velocity alone. In this case we have
f (x) =

x2
sin(2 · 0.6).
32

9.1. FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES AND THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE

We can plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the surface when y = 0.6, as
shown in Figure 9.6. The graph and the formula clearly show that f is quadratic in the x-direction.
More descriptively, as we increase the launch velocity while keeping the launch angle constant,
the range increases proportional to the square of the initial velocity.
Similarly, if we fix the initial velocity at 150 feet per second, we can consider the range as a
function of the launch angle only. In this case we have
f (y) =

1502 sin(2y)
.
32

We can again plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the surface when x = 150,
as shown in Figure 9.7. The graph and the formula clearly show that f is sinusoidal in the ydirection. More descriptively, as we increase the launch angle while keeping the initial velocity
constant, the range is proportional to the sine of twice the launch angle.

The curves we define when we fix one of the independent variables in our two variable function are called traces.
Definition 9.4. A trace of a function f of two independent variables x and y is a curve of the
form z = f (c, y) or z = f (x, c), where c is a constant.

Understanding trends in the behavior of functions of two variables can be challenging, as can
sketching their graphs; traces help us with each of these tasks.

Activity 9.5.
In the following questions, we investigate the use of traces to better understand a function
through both tables and graphs.

Contour Maps and Level Curves
We have all seen topographic maps such as the one of the Porcupine Mountains in the upper
peninsula of Michigan shown in Figure 9.9.3 The curves on these maps show the regions of constant altitude. The contours also depict changes in altitude: contours that are close together signify
steep ascents or descents, while contours that are far apart indicate only slight changes in elevation. Thus, contour maps tell us a lot about three-dimensional surfaces. Mathematically, if f (x, y)
represents the altitude at the point (x, y), then each contour is the graph of an equation of the form
f (x, y) = k, for some constant k.

(a) identify the highest and lowest points you can find;
(b) from a point of your choice, determine a path of steepest ascent that leads to the highest

Definition 9.5. A level curve (or contour) of a function f of two independent variables x and
y is a curve of the form k = f (x, y), where k is a constant.

Topographical maps can be used to create a three-dimensional surface from the two-dimensional
contours or level curves. For example, level curves of the range function defined by f (x, y) =
x2 sin(2y)
plotted in the xy-plane are shown in Figure 9.10. If we lift these contours and plot them
32
at their respective heights, then we get a picture of the surface itself, as illustrated in Figure 9.11.

C
The traces and level curves of a function of two variables are curves in space. In order to
understand these traces and level curves better, we will first spend some time learning about
vectors and vector-valued functions in the next few sections and return to our study of functions
of several variables once we have those more mathematical tools to support their study.

Summary
• A function f of several variables is a rule that assigns a unique number to an ordered collection
of independent inputs. The domain of a function of several variables is the set of all inputs for
which the function is defined.
• In R3 , the distance between points P = (x0 , y0 , z0 ) and Q = (x1 , y1 , z1 ) (denoted as |P Q|) is
given by the formula
p
|P Q| = (x1 − x0 )2 + (y1 − y0 )2 + (z1 − z0 )2 .
and thus the equation of a sphere with center (x0 , y0 , z0 ) and radius r is
(x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 + (z − z0 )2 = r2 .
• A trace of a function f of two independent variables x and y is a curve of the form z = f (c, y)
or z = f (x, c), where c is a constant. A trace tells us how the function depends on a single
independent variable if we treat the other independent variable as a constant.

• A level curve of a function f of two independent variables x and y is a curve of the form
k = f (x, y), where k is a constant. A level curve describes the set of inputs that lead to a
specific output of the function.

2. The Ideal Gas Law, P V = RT , relates the pressure (P , in pascals), temperature (T , in Kelvin),
and volume (V , in cubic meters) of 1 mole of a gas (R = 8.314 molJ K is the universal gas constant), and describes the behavior of gases that do not liquefy easily, such as oxygen and hydrogen. We can solve the ideal gas law for the volume and hence treat the volume as a function
of the pressure and temperature:
8.314T

.

Vectors

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What is a vector?
• What does it mean for two vectors to be equal?
• How do we add two vectors together and multiply a vector by a scalar?
• How do we determine the magnitude of a vector? What is a unit vector, and how do we
find a unit vector in the direction of a given vector?

Introduction
If we are at a point x in the domain of a function of one variable, there are only two directions in
which we can move: in the positive or negative x-direction. If, however, we are at a point (x, y) in
the domain of a function of two variables, there are many directions in which we can move. Thus,
it is important for us to have a means to indicate direction, and we will do so using vectors.
Preview Activity 9.2. After working out, Sarah and John leave the Recreation Center on the Grand
Valley State University Allendale campus (a map of which is given in Figure 9.20) to go to their
next classes.4 Suppose we record Sarah’s movement on the map in a pair hx, yi (we will call this
pair a vector), where x is the horizontal distance (in feet) she moves (with east as the positive
direction) and y as the vertical distance (in feet) she moves (with north as the positive direction).
We do the same for John. Throughout, use the legend to estimate your responses as best you can.
(a) What is the vector v1 = hx, yi that describes Sarah’s movement if she walks directly in a
straight line path from the Recreation Center to the entrance at the northwest end of Mackinac Hall? (Assume a straight line path, even if there are buildings in the way.) Explain
how you found this vector. What is the total distance in feet between the Recreation Center
and the entrance to Mackinac Hall? Measure the number of feet directly and then explain
how to calculate this distance in terms of x and y.
(b) What is the vector v2 = hx, yi that describes John’s change in position if he walks directly
from the Recreation Center to Au Sable Hall? How many feet are there between Recreation
Center to Au Sable Hall in terms of x and y?
(c) What is the vector v3 = hx, yi that describes the change in position if John walks directly
from Au Sable Hall to the northwest entrance of Mackinac Hall to meet up with Sarah after

Representations of Vectors
Preview Activity 9.2 shows how we can record the magnitude and direction of a change in position using an ordered pair of numbers hx, yi. There are many other quantities, such as force
and velocity, that possess the attributes of magnitude and direction, and we will call each such
quantity a vector.
Definition 9.6. A vector is any quantity that possesses the attributes of magnitude and direction.
We can represent a vector geometrically as a directed line segment, with the magnitude as the
length of the segment and an arrowhead indicating direction, as shown in Figure 9.21.

Figure 9.21: A vector.

Figure 9.22: Representations of the same vector.

According to the definition, a vector possesses the attributes of length (magnitude) and direction; the vector’s position, however, is not mentioned. Consequently, we regard as equal any two
vectors having the same magnitude and direction, as shown in Figure 9.22.
Two vectors are equal provided they have the same magnitude and direction.
This means that the same vector may be drawn in the plane in many different ways. For
instance, suppose that we would like to draw the vector h3, 4i, which represents a horizontal
change of three units and a vertical change of four units. We may place the tail of the vector (the
point from which the vector originates) at the origin and the tip (the terminal point of the vector)
at (3, 4), as illustrated in Figure 9.23. A vector with its tail at the origin is said to be in standard
position.
Alternatively, we may place the tail of the vector h3, 4i at another point, such as Q(1, 1). After
a displacement of three units to the right and four units up, the tip of the vector is at the point
R(4, 5) (see Figure 9.24).

h3, 4i because we move horizontally three units and vertically four units to get from Q to R. In

We will use boldface letters to represent vectors, such as v = h3, 4i, to distinguish them from
scalars. The entries of a vector are called its components; in the vector h3, 4i, the x component is 3
and the y component is 4. We use pointed brackets h , i and the term components to distinguish a
vector from a point ( , ) and its coordinates. There is, however, a close connection between vectors

While we often illustrate vectors in the plane since it is easier to draw pictures, different situations call for the use of vectors in three or more dimensions. For instance, a vector v in n-

dimensional space, Rn , has n components and may be represented as
v = hv1 , v2 , v3 , . . . , vn i.
The next activity will help us to become accustomed to vectors and operations on vectors in
three dimensions.

Equality of Vectors
Because location is not mentioned in the definition of a vector, any two vectors that have the same
magnitude and direction are equal. It is helpful to have an algebraic way to determine when this
occurs. That is, if we know the components of two vectors u and v, we will want to be able to
determine algebraically when u and v are equal. There is an obvious set of conditions that we use.
Two vectors u = hu1 , u2 i and v = hv1 , v2 i in R2 are equal if and only if their corresponding
components are equal: u1 = v1 and u2 = v2 . More generally, two vectors u = hu1 , u2 , . . . , un i
and v = hv1 , v2 , . . . , vn i in Rn are equal if and only if ui = vi for each possible value of i.

Operations on Vectors
Vectors are not numbers, but we can now represent them with components that are real numbers.
As such, we naturally wonder if it is possible to add two vectors together, multiply two vectors,
or combine vectors in any other ways. In this section, we will study two operations on vectors:
vector addition and scalar multiplication. To begin, we investigate a natural way to add two
vectors together, as well as to multiply a vector by a scalar.

Activity 9.9.
Let u = h2, 3i, v = h−1, 4i.

u + v?

(b) In general, how do you think the vector sum a+b of vectors a = ha1 , a2 i and b = hb1 , b2 i
in R2 should be defined? Write a formal definition of a vector sum based on your
intuition.
(c) In general, how do you think the vector sum a + b of vectors a = ha1 , a2 , a3 i and
b = hb1 , b2 , b3 i in R3 should be defined? Write a formal definition of a vector sum
based on your intuition.
(d) Returning to the specific vector v = h−1, 4i given above, what is the natural way to
define the scalar multiple 12 v?
(e) In general, how do you think a scalar multiple of a vector a = ha1 , a2 i in R2 by a scalar
c should be defined? how about for a scalar multiple of a vector a = ha1 , a2 , a3 i in R3
by a scalar c? Write a formal definition of a scalar multiple of a vector based on your
intuition.
C

We can now add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars, and thus we can add together scalar
multiples of vectors. This allows us to define vector subtraction, v − u, as the sum of v and −1 times
u, so that
v − u = v + (−1)u.
Using vector addition and scalar multiplication, we will often represent vectors in terms of the
special vectors i = h1, 0i and j = h0, 1i. For instance, we can write the vector ha, bi in R2 as
ha, bi = ah1, 0i + bh0, 1i = ai + bj,
which means that
h2, −3i = 2i − 3j.
In the context of R3 , we let i = h1, 0, 0i, j = h0, 1, 0i, and k = h0, 0, 1i, and we can write the vector
ha, b, ci in R3 as
ha, b, ci = ah1, 0, 0i + bh0, 1, 0i + ch0, 0, 1i = ai + bj + ck.
The vectors i, j, and k are called the standard unit vectors5 , and are important in the physical sciences.

Properties of Vector Operations
We know that the scalar sum 1 + 2 is equal to the scalar sum 2 + 1. This is called the commutative
property of scalar addition. Any time we define operations on objects (like addition of vectors) we
usually want to know what kinds of properties the operations have. For example, is addition of
vectors a commutative operation? To answer this question we take two arbitrary vectors v and u
5

As we will learn momentarily, unit vectors have length 1.

9.2. VECTORS

25

and add them together and see what happens. Let v = hv1 , v2 i and u = hu1 , u2 i. Now we use the
fact that v1 , v2 , u1 , and u2 are scalars, and that the addition of scalars is commutative to see that
v + u = hv1 , v2 i + hu1 , u2 i = hv1 + u1 , v2 + u2 i = hu1 + v1 , u2 + v2 i = hu1 , u2 i + hv1 , v2 i = u + v.
So the vector sum is a commutative operation. Similar arguments can be used to show the following properties of vector addition and scalar multiplication.
Let v, u, and w be vectors in Rn and let a and b be scalars. Then
1. v + u = u + v
2. (v + u) + w = v + (u + w)
3. The vector 0 = h0, 0, . . . , 0i has the property that v + 0 = v. The vector 0 is called the
zero vector.
4. (−1)v + v = 0. The vector (−1)v = −v is called the additive inverse of the vector v.
5. (a + b)v = av + bv
6. a(v + u) = av + au
7. (ab)v = a(bv)
8. 1v = v.
We verified the first property for vectors in R2 ; it is straightforward to verify that the rest of
the eight properties just noted hold for all vectors in Rn .

Geometric Interpretation of Vector Operations
Next, we explore a geometric interpretation of vector addition and scalar multiplication that allows us to visualize these operations. Let u = h4, 6i and v = h3, −2i. Then w = u + v = h7, 4i, as
shown on the left in Figure 9.26.
If we think of these vectors as displacements in the plane, we find a geometric way to envision
vector addition. For instance, the vector u + v will represent the displacement obtained by following the displacement u with the displacement v. We may picture this by placing the tail of v at the
tip of u, as seen in the center of Figure 9.26.
Of course, vector addition is commutative so we obtain the same sum if we place the tail of u
at the tip of v. We therefore see that u+v appears as the diagonal of the parallelogram determined
by u and v, as shown on the right of Figure 9.26.
Vector subtraction has a similar interpretation. On the left in Figure 9.27, we see vectors u, v,
and w = u + v. If we rewrite v = w − u, we have the arrangement of Figure 9.28. In other words,
to form the difference w − u, we draw a vector from the tip of u to the tip of w.

In a similar way, we may geometrically represent a scalar multiple of a vector. For instance,
if v = h2, 3i, then 2v = h4, 6i. As shown in Figure 9.29, multiplying v by 2 leaves the direction
unchanged, but stretches v by 2. Also, −2v = h−4, −6i, which shows that multiplying by a
negative scalar gives a vector pointing in the opposite direction of v.

C

The Magnitude of a Vector
By definition, vectors have both direction and magnitude (or length). We now investigate how to
calculate the magnitude of a vector. Since a vector v can be represented by a directed line segment,

28

we can use the distance formula to calculate the length of the segment. This length is the magnitude
of the vector v and is denoted |v|.

Summary
• A vector is any object that possesses the attributes of magnitude and direction. Examples of
vector quantities are position, velocity, acceleration, and force.

9.2. VECTORS

• Two vectors are equal if they have the same direction and magnitude. Notice that position is
not considered, so a vector is independent of its location.
• If u = hu1 , u2 , . . . , un i and v = hv1 , v2 , . . . , vn i are two vectors in Rn , then their vector sum is
the vector
u + v = hu1 + v1 , u2 + v2 , . . . , un + vn i.
If u = hu1 , u2 , . . . , un i is a vector in Rn and c is a scalar, then the scalar multiple cu is the vector
cu = hcu1 , cu2 , . . . , cun i.

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• How is the dot product of two vectors defined and what geometric information does it tell
us?
• How can we tell if two vectors in Rn are perpendicular?
• How do we find the projection of one vector onto another?

Introduction
In the last section, we considered vector addition and scalar multiplication and found that each
operation had a natural geometric interpretation. In this section, we will introduce a means of
multiplying vectors.

9.3. THE DOT PRODUCT

33

The Dot Product
If we have two n-dimensional vectors u = hu1 , u2 , . . . , un i and v = hv1 , v2 , . . . , vn i, we define their
dot product6 as
u · v = u1 v1 + u2 v2 + . . . + un vn .
For instance, we find that
h3, 0, 1i · h−2, 1, 4i = 3 · (−2) + 0 · 1 + 1 · 4 = −6 + 0 + 4 = −2.
Notice that the resulting quantity is a scalar. Our work in Preview Activity 9.3 examined dot
products of two-dimensional vectors.

Activity 9.12.
Determine each of the following.
(a) h1, 2, −3i · h4, −2, 0i.
(b) h0, 3, −2, 1i · h5, −6, 0, 4i
C
The dot product is a natural way to define a product of two vectors. In addition, it behaves in
ways that are similar to the product of, say, real numbers.
Let u, v, and w be vectors in Rn . Then
(a) u · v = v · u (the dot product is commutative), and
(b) if c is a scalar, then (cu + v) · w = c(u · w) + v · w (the dot product is bilinear),
Moreover, the dot product gives us valuable geometric information about the vectors and their
relative orientation. For instance, let’s consider what happens when we dot a vector with itself:
u · u = hu1 , u2 , . . . , un i · hu1 , u2 , . . . , un i = u21 + u22 + . . . + u2n = |u|2 .
In other words, the dot product of a vector with itself gives the square of the length of the vector:
u · u = |u|2 .

The angle between vectors
The dot product can help us understand the angle between two vectors. For instance, if we are
given two vectors u and v, there are two angles that these vectors create, as depicted in Figure
9.37. We will call θ, the smaller of these angles, the angle between these vectors. Notice that θ lies
between 0 and π.
6

As we will see shortly, the dot product arises in physics to calculate the work done by a vector force in a given direction. It might be more natural to define the dot product in this context, but it is more convenient from a mathematical
perspective to define the dot product algebraically and then view work as an application of this definition.

Figure 9.38: The triangle formed by u, v, and

To determine this angle, we may apply the Law of Cosines to the triangle shown in Figure 9.38.
Using the fact that the dot product of a vector with itself gives us the square of its length,
together with the bilinearity of the dot product, we find:
|u − v|2 = |u|2 + |v|2 − 2|u||v| cos(θ)

(u − v) · (u − v) = u · u + v · v − 2|u||v| cos(θ)

u · (u − v) − v · (u − v) = u · u + v · v − 2|u||v| cos(θ)
u · u − 2u · v + v · v = u · u + v · v − 2|u||v| cos(θ)
−2u · v = −2|u||v| cos(θ)
u · v = |u||v| cos(θ).

To summarize, we have the important relationship
u · v = u1 v1 + u2 v2 + . . . + un vn = |u||v| cos(θ).

It is sometimes useful to think of Equation (9.3) as giving us an expression for the angle between two vectors:

The real beauty of this expression is this: the dot product is a very simple algebraic operation to
perform yet it provides us with important geometric information – namely the angle between the
vectors – that would be difficult to determine otherwise.

Activity 9.13.
Determine each of the following.
(a) The length of the vector u = h1, 2, −3i using the dot product.
(b) The angle between the vectors u = h1, 2i and v = h4, −1i to the nearest tenth of a
degree.

(c) The angle between the vectors y = h1, 2, −3i and z = h−2, 1, 1i to the nearest tenth of a

(d) If the angle between the vectors u and v is a right angle, what does the expression
u · v = |u||v| cos θ say about their dot product?
(e) If the angle between the vectors u and v is acute—that is, less than π/2—what does the
expression u · v = |u||v| cos θ say about their dot product?
(f) If the angle between the vectors u and v is obtuse—that is, greater than π/2—what does
the expression u · v = |u||v| cos θ say about their dot product?
C

The Dot Product and Orthogonality
When the angle between two vectors is a right angle, it is frequently the case that something
important is happening. In this case, we say the vectors are orthogonal. For instance, orthogonality
often plays a role in optimization problems; to determine the shortest path from a point in R3 to a
given plane, we move along a line orthogonal to the plane.
As Activity 9.13 indicates, the dot product provides a simple means to determine whether two
vectors are orthogonal to one another. In this case, u · v = |u||v| cos(π/2) = 0, so we make the
following important observation.
Two vectors u and v in Rn are orthogonal to each other if u · v = 0.
More generally, the sign of the dot product gives us useful information about the relative orientation of the vectors. If we remember that
cos(θ) > 0
cos(θ) = 0
and cos(θ) < 0

if θ is an acute angle,
if θ is a right angle,
if θ is an obtuse angle,

we see that
u·v >0
u·v =0
and u · v < 0
This is illustrated in Figure 9.39.

if θ is an acute angle,
if θ is a right angle,
if θ is an obtuse angle.

W = F · AB = |F||AB| cos(θ).
This means that the work is determined only by the magnitude of the force applied parallel to the
displacement. Consequently, if we are given two vectors u and v, we would like to write u as a
sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel to v and one of which is orthogonal to v. We take up
this task after the next activity.

Figure 9.41: The projection of u onto v.

Suppose we are given two vectors u and v as shown in Figure 9.41. Motivated by our discussion of work, we would like to write u as a sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel to v and
one of which is orthogonal. That is, we would like to write
u = projv u + proj⊥v u,

(9.4)

where projv u is parallel to v and proj⊥v u is orthogonal to v. We call the vector projv u the projection
of u onto v.
To find the vector projv u, we will dot both sides of Equation (9.4) with the vector v, to find that
u · v = (projv u + proj⊥v u) · v

= (projv u) · v + (proj⊥v u) · v

= (projv u) · v.

Notice that (proj⊥v u) · v = 0 since proj⊥v u is orthogonal to v. Also, projv u must be a scalar
multiple of v since it is parallel to v, so we will write projv u = sv. It follows that
u · v = (projv u) · v = sv · v,
which means that
s=
and hence
projv u =

u·v

It is sometimes useful to write projv u as a scalar times a unit vector in the direction of v. We
call this scalar the component of u along v and denote it as compv u. We therefore have

compv u =

and the projection of u onto v is the vector

v·v

Moreover, since
u = projv u + proj⊥v u,
it follows that
proj⊥v u = u − projv u.

This shows that once we have computed projv u, we can find proj⊥v u simply by calculating the
difference of two known vectors.

Activity 9.15.
Let u = h2, 6i and v = h4, −8i. Find compv u, projv u and proj⊥v u, and draw a picture to
illustrate. Finally, express u as the sum of two vectors where one is parallel to v and the other
is perpendicular to v.

Summary
• The dot product of two vectors in Rn , u = hu1 , u2 , . . . , un i and v = hv1 , v2 , . . . , vn i, is the scalar
u · v = u1 v1 + u2 v2 + · · · + un vn .
• The dot product is related to the length of a vector since u · u = |u|2 .
• The dot product provides us with information about the angle between the vectors since
u · v = |u| |v| cos(θ),
where θ is the angle between u and v.
• Two vectors are orthogonal if the angle between them is π/2. In terms of the dot product, the
vectors u and v are orthogonal if and only if u · v = 0.

The Cross Product

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• How and when is the cross product of two vectors defined?
• What geometric information does the cross product provide?
The last two sections have introduced some basic algebraic operations on vectors—addition,
scalar multiplication, and the dot product—with useful geometric interpretations. In this section,
we will meet a final algebraic operation, the cross product, which again conveys important geometric information.
To begin, we must emphasize that the cross product is only defined for vectors u and v in
Also, remember that we use a right-hand coordinate system, as described in Section 9.1. In
particular, recall that the vectors i, j, and k are oriented as shown below in Figure 9.43. Earlier,
we noticed that if we point the index finger of our right hand in the direction of i and our middle
finger in the direction of j, then our thumb points in the direction of k.

Preview Activity 9.4. The cross product of two vectors, u and v, will itself be a vector denoted
u × v. The direction of u × v is determined by the right-hand rule: if we point the index finger of
our right hand in the direction of u and our middle finger in the direction of v, then our thumb
points in the direction of u × v.
(a) We begin by defining the cross products using the vectors i, j, and k. Referring to Figure
9.43, explain why i, j, k in that order form a right-hand system. We then define i × j to be
k – that is i × j = k.
(b) Now explain why i, k, and −j in that order form a right-hand system. We then define i × k
to be −j – that is i × k = −j.
(c) Continuing in this way, complete the missing entries in Table 9.4.

Table 9.4: Table of cross products involving i, j, and k.
(d) Up to this point, the products you have seen, such as the product of real numbers and the
dot product of vectors, have been commutative, meaning that the product does not depend
on the order of the terms. For instance, 2 · 5 = 5 · 2. The table above suggests, however,
that the cross product is anti-commutative: for any vectors u and v in R3 , u × v = −v × u.
If we consider the case when u = v, this shows that v × v = −v × v. What does this tell
us about v × v; in particular, what vector is unchanged by scalar multiplication by −1?

(e) The cross product is also a bilinear operation, meaning that it interacts with scalar multiplication and vector addition as one would expect: (cu + v) × w = c(u × w) + v × w. For
example,
(2i + j) × k = 2(i × k) + (j × k) = −2j + i.
Using this property along with Table 9.4, find the cross product u × v if u = 2i + 3j and
v = −i + k.

(f) Verify that the cross product u × v you just found in part (e) is orthogonal to both u and v.
(g) Consider the vectors u and v in the xy-plane as shown below in Figure 9.44.

Explain why u = |u|i and v = |v| cos(θ)i + |v| sin(θ)j. Then compute the length of |u × v|.
(h) Multiplication of real numbers is associative, which means, for instance, that (2 · 5) · 3 =
2 · (5 · 3). Is it true that the cross product of vectors is associative? For instance, is it true
that (i × j) × j = i × (j × j)?

9.4. THE CROSS PRODUCT

Computing the cross product
As we have seen in Preview Activity 9.4, the cross product u × v is defined for two vectors u and
v in R3 and produces another vector in R3 . Using the right-hand rule, we saw that
i × j = k,

i × k = −j,

j×k=i

j × i = −k

k×i=j

k × j = −i

If in addition we apply the bilinearity property to compute the cross product in terms of the
components of general vectors, u and v we see that7
u × v = (u1 i + u2 j + u3 k) × (v1 i + v2 j + v3 k)
= u1 i × (v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) +

u2 j × (v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) +
u3 k × (v1 i + v2 j + v3 k)

= u1 v1 i × i + u1 v2 i × j + u1 v3 i × k +

u2 v1 j × i + u2 v2 j × j + u2 v3 j × k +
u3 v1 k × i + u3 v2 k × j + u3 v3 k × k

= u1 v2 k − u1 v3 j − u2 v1 k + u2 v3 i + u3 v1 j − u3 v2 i

= (u2 v3 − u3 v2 )i − (u1 v3 − u3 v1 )j + (u1 v2 − u2 v1 )k

To summarize, we have shown that
(u1 i + u2 j + u3 k) × (v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) = (u2 v3 − u3 v2 )i − (u1 v3 − u3 v1 )j + (u1 v2 − u2 v1 )k.

(9.5)

At first, this may look intimidating and difficult to remember. However, if we rewrite the
expression in Equation (9.5) using determinants, important structure emerges. The determinant
of a 2 × 2 matrix is
a b
= ad − bc.
c d
It follows that we can thus rewrite Equation (9.5) in the form
u×v =

.

Like the dot product, the cross product arises in physical applications, e.g., torque, but is it more convenient mathematically to begin from an algebraic perspective.

9.4. THE CROSS PRODUCT

Activity 9.16.
Suppose u = h2, −1, 0i and v = h0, 1, 3i. Use the formula (9.5) for the following.
(a) Find the cross product u × v.
(b) Find the cross product u × i.
(c) Find the cross product u × u.
(d) Evaluate the dot products u · (u × v) and v · (u × v). What does this tell you about the
geometric relationship among u, v, and u × v?

C
The cross product satisfies the following properties, which were illustrated in Preview Activity
9.4 and may be easily verified from the definition (9.5).
Let u, v, and w be vectors in R3 , and let c be a scalar. Then
1. u × v = −(v × u)
2. (cu + v) × w = c(u × w) + v × w
3. u × v = 0 if u and v are parallel.
4. The cross product is not associative; that is, in general
(u × v) × w 6= u × (v × w).

Just as we found for the dot product, the cross product provides us with useful geometric information. In particular, both the length and direction of the cross product u × v encode information
about the geometric relationship between u and v.

The Length of u × v
We may ask whether the length |u × v| has any relationship to the lengths of u and v. To investigate, we will compute the square of the length |u × v|2 and denote by θ the angle between u and
v, as in Section 9.3. Doing so, we find through some significant algebra that

44

9.4. THE CROSS PRODUCT

|u × v|2 = (u2 v3 − u3 v2 )2 + (u1 v3 − u3 v1 )2 + (u1 v2 − u2 v1 )2

= u22 v32 − 2u2 u3 v2 v3 + u23 v22 + u21 v32 − 2u1 u3 v1 v3 + u23 v12 + u21 v22 − 2u1 u2 v1 v2 + u22 v12
= u21 (v22 + v32 ) + u22 (v12 + v32 ) + u23 (v12 + v22 ) − 2(u1 u2 v1 v2 + u1 u3 v1 v3 + u2 u3 v2 v3 )
= u21 (v12 + v22 + v32 ) + u22 (v12 + v22 + v32 ) + u23 (v12 + v22 + v32 ) −

(u21 v12 + u22 v22 + u23 v32 + 2(u1 u2 v1 v2 + u1 u3 v1 v3 + u2 u3 v2 v3 ))

= (u21 + u22 + u23 )(v12 + v22 + v32 ) − (u1 v1 + u2 v2 + u3 v3 )2
= |u|2 |v|2 − (u · v)2

= |u|2 |v|2 (1 − cos2 (θ))
= |u|2 |v|2 sin2 (θ).

Therefore, we have found |u × v|2 = |u|2 |v|2 sin2 (θ), which means that
|u × v| = |u||v| sin(θ).

(9.6)

Note that the third property stated above says that u × v = 0 if u and v are parallel. This is
reflected in Equation (9.6) since sin(θ) = 0 if u and v are parallel, which implies that u × v = 0.
Equation (9.6) also has a geometric implication. Consider the parallelogram formed by two
vectors u and v, as shown in Figure 9.45.
v

|v| sin θ

u

Figure 9.45: The parallelogram formed by u and v
Remember that the area of a parallelogram is the product of its base and height. As shown in
the figure, we may consider the base of the parallelogram to be |u| and the height to be |v| sin(θ).
This means that the area of the parallelogram formed by u and v is
|u||v| sin(θ) = |u × v|.
This leads to the following interesting fact.
The length, |u × v|, of the cross product of vectors u and v is the area of the parallelogram
determined by u and v.

9.4. THE CROSS PRODUCT

Activity 9.17.
(a) Find the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors u = h1, 3, −2i and v = h3, 0, 1i.
(b) Find the area of the parallelogram in R3 whose vertices are (1, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0),
and (1, 1, 0).
C

The Direction of u × v
Now that we understand the length of u × v, we will investigate its direction. Remember from
Preview Activity 9.4 that cross products involving the vectors i, j, and k resulted in vectors that
are orthogonal to the two terms. We will see that this holds more generally.
We begin by computing u · (u × v), and see that
u · (u × v) = u1 (u2 v3 − u3 v2 ) − u2 (u1 v3 − u3 v1 ) + u3 (u1 v2 − u2 v1 )

= u1 u2 v3 − u1 u3 v2 − u2 u1 v3 + u2 u3 v1 + u3 u1 v2 − u3 u2 v1
= 0

To summarize, we have u · (u × v) = 0, which implies that u is orthogonal to u × v. In the same
way, we can show that v is orthogonal to u × v. The net effect is that u × v is a vector that is
perpendicular to both u and v, and hence u × v is perpendicular to the plane determined by u
and v. Moreover, the direction of u × v is determined by applying the right-hand rule to u and v,
as we saw in Preview Activity 9.4. In light of our earlier work that showed |u||v| sin(θ) = |u × v|.,
we may now express u × v in the following different way.
Suppose that u and v are not parallel and that n is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane
containing u and v determined by the right-hand rule. Then
u × v = |u||v| sin(θ) n.
There is yet one more geometric implication we may draw from this result. Suppose u, v, and
w are vectors in R3 that are not coplanar and that form a three-dimension parallelepiped as shown
in Figure 9.46.
The volume of the parallelepiped is determined by multiplying A, the area of the base, by the
height h. As we have just seen, the area of the base is |u × v|. Moreover, the height h = |w| cos(α)
where α is the angle between w and the vector n, which is orthogonal to the plane formed by u
and v. Since n is parallel to u × v, the angle between w and u × v is also α. This shows that
|(u × v) · w| = |u × w||w| cos(α) = Ah,

Torque is measured by a cross product
We have seen that the cross product enables us to produce a vector perpendicular to two given
vectors, to measure the area of a parallelogram, and to measure the volume of a parallelepiped.
Besides these geometric applications, the cross product also enables us to describe a physical quantity called torque.
Suppose that we would like to turn a bolt using a wrench as shown in Figure 9.48. If a force F
is applied to the wrench and r is the vector from the position on the wrench at which the force is
applied to center of the bolt, we define the torque, τ , to be
τ = F × r.
When a force is applied to an object, Newton’s Second Law tells us that the force is equal to
the rate of change of the object’s linear momentum. Similarly, the torque applied to an object is
equal to the rate of change of the object’s angular momentum. In other words, torque will cause
the bolt to rotate.
In many industrial applications, bolts are required to be tightened using a specified torque.
Of course, the magnitude of the torque is |τ | = |F × r| = |F||r|| sin(θ). Thus, to produce a larger
torque, we can increase either |F| or |r|, which you may know if you have ever removed lug nuts
when changing a flat tire. The ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes said: “Give me a lever
long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.” A modern spin on
this statement is: “Allow me to make |r| large enough, and I shall produce a torque large enough
to move the world.”

Comparing the dot and cross products
Finally, it is worthwhile to compare and contrast the dot and cross products.

(a) u · v is a scalar, while u × v is a vector.
(b) u · v = v · u, while u × v = −v × u
(c) u · v = |u||v| cos(θ), while |u × v| = |u||v| sin(θ).
(d) u · v = 0 if u and v are perpendicular, while u × v = 0 if u and v are parallel.

Summary
• The cross product is defined only for vectors in R3 . The cross product of vectors u and v in R3
is the vector
(u1 i + u2 j + u3 k) × (v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) = (u2 v3 − u3 v2 )i − (u1 v3 − u3 v1 )j + (u1 v2 − u2 v1 )k.
• Geometrically, the cross product is
u × v = |u| |v| sin(θ) n,
where θ is the angle between u and v and n is a unit vector perpendicular to both u and v as
determined by the right-hand rule.
• The cross product of vectors u and v is a vector perpendicular to both u and v.
• The magnitude |u × v| of the cross product of the vectors u and v gives the area of the parallelogram determined by u and v. Also, the scalar triple product |(u × v) · w| gives the volume of
the parallelepiped determined by u, v, and w.

Lines and Planes in Space

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• How are lines in R3 similar to and different from lines in R2 ?
• What is the role that vectors play in representing equations of lines, particularly in R3 ?
• How can we think of a plane as a set of points determined by a point and a vector?
• How do we find the equation of a plane through three given non-collinear points?

Introduction
In single variable calculus, we learn that a differentiable function is locally linear . In other words,
if we zoom in on the graph of a differentiable function at a point, the graph looks like the tangent
line to the function at that point. In multivariable calculus, we will soon study curves in space;
differentiable curves turn out to be locally linear as well. In addition, as we study functions of two
variables, we will see that such a function is locally linear at a point if the surface defined by the
function looks like a plane (the tangent plane) as we zoom in on the graph.
Consequently, it is important for us to understand both lines and planes in space. We begin
our work by considering some familiar ideas in R2 but from a new perspective.
Preview Activity 9.5. We are familiar with equations of lines in the plane in the form y = mx + b,
where m is the slope of the line and (0, b) is the y-intercept. In this activity, we explore a more
flexible way of representing lines that we can use not only in the plane, but in higher dimensions
as well.
To begin, consider the line through the point (2, −1) with slope 32 .

51

(b) Suppose we decrease x by 3.25 from the point (2, −1). How does the y-value change? What
is the point on the line with x-coordinate −1.25?
(c) Now, suppose we increase x by some arbitrary value 3t from the point (2, −1). How does
the y-value change? What is the point on the line with x-coordinate 2 + 3t?
(d) Observe that the slope of the line is related to any vector whose y-component divided by
the x-component is the slope of the line. For the line in this exercise, we might use the
vector h3, 2i, which describes the direction of the line. Explain why the terminal points of
the vectors r(t), where
r(t) = h2, −1i + h3, 2it,
trace out the graph of the line through the point (2, −1) with slope 32 .

(e) Now we extend this vector approach to R3 and consider a second example. Let L be the
line in R3 through the point (1, 0, 2) in the direction of the vector h2, −1, 4i.
Find the coordinates of three distinct points on line L. Explain your thinking.

(f) Find a vector in form
r(t) = hx0 , y0 , z0 i + ha, b, cit
whose terminal points trace out the line L that is described in (e). That is, you should be
able to locate any point on the line by determining a corresponding value of t.
./

Lines in Space
In two-dimensional space, a non-vertical line is defined to be the set of points satisfying the equation
y = mx + b,
for some constants m and b. The value of m (the slope) tells us how the dependent variable
changes for every one unit increase in the independent variable, while the point (0, b) is the yintercept and anchors the line to a location on the y-axis. Alternatively, we can think of the slope
as being related to the vector h1, mi, which tells us the direction of the line, as shown on the left in
Figure 9.49. Thus, we can identify a line in space by fixing a point P and a direction v, as shown
on the right.
Definition 9.7. A line in space is the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given
point P that are parallel to a fixed vector v.

The fixed vector v in the definition is called a direction vector for the line. As we saw in Preview
Activity 9.5, to find an equation for a line through point P in the direction of vector v, observe that

OP and the vector tv as in Equation (9.7). Here, OP is the fixed vector shown in blue, while
the direction vector v is the vector parallel to the vector shown in green (that is, the green vector
represents tv, and the line is traced out by the terminal points of the magenta vector). In other
−−→
words, the tips (terminal points) of the magenta vectors (the vectors of the form OP + tv) trace
out the line as t changes.
In particular, the terminal points of the vectors of the form in (9.7) define a linear function r in
space of the following form, which is valid in any dimension.
The vector form of a line through the point P in the direction of the vector v is
r(t) = r0 + tv,

where r0 is the vector OP from the origin to the point P .

(9.8)

9.5. LINES AND PLANES IN SPACE

53

Of course, it is common to represent lines in the plane using the slope-intercept equation y =
mx + b. The vector form of the line, described above, is an alternative way to represent lines that
has the following two advantages. First, in two dimensions, we are able to represent vertical lines,
whose slope m is not defined, using a vertical direction vector, such as v = h0, 1i. Second, this
description of lines works in any dimension even though there is no concept of the slope of a line
in more than two dimensions.

The Parametric Equations of a Line
The vector form of a line, r(t) = r0 + tv in Equation (9.8), describes a line as the set of terminal
points of the vectors r(t). If we write this in terms of components letting
r(t) = hx(t), y(t), z(t)i, r0 = hx0 , y0 , z0 i,

and v = ha, b, ci,

then we can equate the components on both sides of r(t) = r0 + tv to obtain the equations
x(t) = x0 + at,

y(t) = y0 + bt,

and z(t) = z0 + ct,

54

9.5. LINES AND PLANES IN SPACE

which describe the coordinates of the points on the line. The variable t represents an arbitrary
scalar and is called a parameter. In particular, we use the following language.
The parametric equations for a line through the point P = (x0 , y0 , z0 ) in the direction of the
vector v = ha, b, ci are
x(t) = x0 + at,

y(t) = y0 + bt,

z(t) = z0 + ct.

Notice that there are many different parametric equations for the same line. For example,
choosing another point P on the line or another direction vector v produces another set of parametric equations. It is sometimes useful to think of t as a time parameter and the parametric
equations as telling us where we are on the line at each time. In this way, the parametric equations
describe a particular walk taken along the line; there are, of course, many possible ways to walk
along a line.

Activity 9.20.

(b) Does the point (1, 2, 1) lie on L? If so, what value of t results in this point?
(c) Consider another line, K, whose parametric equations are

What is the direction of line K?
(d) Do lines L and K intersect? If so, provide the point of intersection and the t and s values,
respectively, that result in the point. If not, explain why.
C

Planes in Space
Now that we have a way of describing lines, we would like to develop a means of describing
planes in three dimensions. We studied the coordinate planes and planes parallel to them in
Section 9.1. Each of those planes had one of the variables x, y, or z equal to a constant. We can
note that any vector in a plane with x constant is orthogonal to the vector h1, 0, 0i, any vector in a
plane with y constant is orthogonal to the vector h0, 1, 0i, and any vector in a plane with z constant
is orthogonal to the vector h0, 0, 1i. This idea works in general to define a plane.
Definition 9.8. A plane p in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating from a
given point P0 perpendicular to a fixed vector n, as shown in Figure 9.52.

P = (x, y, z)

P0 = (x0 , y0 , z0 )

Figure 9.52: A point P0 on a plane p with a normal vector n

The definition allows us to find the equation of a plane. Assume that n = ha, b, ci, P0 =
−−→
(x0 , y0 , z0 ), and that P = (x, y, z) is an arbitrary point on the plane. Since the vector P P0 lies in the
plane, it must be perpendicular to n. This means that
−−→
0 = n · P P0


= n · hx, y, zi − hx0 , y0 , z0 i
= n · hx − x0 , y − y0 , z − z0 i

= a(x − x0 ) + b(y − y0 ) + c(z − z0 ).

The fixed vector n perpendicular to the plane is frequently called a normal vector to the plane.
We may now summarize as follows.
The scalar equation of the plane with normal vector n = ha, b, ci containing the point P0 =
(x0 , y0 , z0 ) is
a(x − x0 ) + b(y − y0 ) + c(z − z0 ) = 0.
(9.9)
We may take this a little further and note that since
a(x − x0 ) + b(y − y0 ) + c(z − z0 ) = 0,
it equivalently follows that
ax + by + cz = ax0 + by0 + cz0 .
That is, we may write the equation of a plane as ax + by + cz = d where where d = n · hx0 , y0 , z0 i.

For instance, if we would like to describe the plane passing through the point P0 = (4, −2, 1)
and perpendicular to the vector n = h1, 2, 1i, we have
h1, 2, 1i · hx, y, zi = h1, 2, 1i · h4, −2, 1i

56

9.5. LINES AND PLANES IN SPACE

or
x + 2y + z = 1.
Notice that the coefficients of x, y, and z in this description give a vector perpendicular to the
plane. For instance, if we are presented with the plane
−2x + y − 3z = 4,
we know that n = h−2, 1, −3i is a vector perpendicular to the plane.

Activity 9.21.

(a) Write the equation of the plane p1 passing through the point (0, 2, 4) and perpendicular

(b) Is the point (2, 0, 2) on the plane p1 ?
(c) Write the equation of the plane p2 that is parallel to p1 and passing through the point
(3, 0, 4).

perpendicular to the plane p3 described the equation x + 2y − 2z = 7.
(e) Find the point at which l intersects the plane p3 .
C
Just as two distinct points in space determine a line, three non-collinear points in space determine a plane. Consider three points P0 , P1 , and P2 in space, not all lying on the same line as

Summary
• While lines in R3 do not have a slope, like lines in R2 they can be characterized by a point and
a direction vector. Indeed, we define a line in space to be the set of terminal points of vectors
emanating from a given point that are parallel to a fixed vector.
• Vectors play a critical role in representing the equation of a line. In particular, the terminal
points of the vector r(t) = r0 + tv define a linear function r in space through the terminal point
of the vector r0 in the direction of the vector v, tracing out a line in space.
• A plane in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point perpendicular to a fixed vector.

the plane satisfies the equation P P1 · n = 0. If we let P = (x, y, z), n = ha, b, ci be the normal
vector, and P1 = (x0 , y0 , z0 ), we can also represent the plane with the equation
a(x − x0 ) + b(y − y0 ) + c(z − z0 ) = 0.

Vector-Valued Functions

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What is a vector-valued function? What do we mean by the graph of a vector-valued function?
• What is a parameterization of a curve in R2 ? In R3 ? What can the parameterization of a
curve can tell us?

Introduction
So far, we have seen several different examples of curves in space, including traces and contours
of functions of two variables, as well as lines in 3-space. Recall that for a line through a fixed point
r0 in the direction of vector v, we may express the line parametrically through the single vector
equation
r(t) = r0 + tv.
From this perspective, the vector r(t) is a function that depends on the parameter t, and the terminal points of this vector trace out the line in space.
Like lines, other curves in space are one-dimensional objects, and thus we aspire to similarly
express the coordinates of points on a given curve in terms of a single variable. Vectors are a
perfect vehicle for doing so – we can use vectors based at the origin to identify points in space,
and connect the terminal points of these vectors to draw a curve in space. This approach will allow
us to draw an incredible variety of graphs in 2- and 3-space, as well as to identify and describe
curves in n-space for any n.
Preview Activity 9.6. In this activity we consider how we might use vectors to define a curve in
space.

9.6. VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

Vector-Valued Functions
Consider the curve shown in Figure 9.54. As in Preview Activity 9.6, we can think of a point on
this curve as resulting from a vector from the origin to the point. As the point travels along the
curve, the vector changes in order to terminate at the desired point. A few still pictures of this
motion are shown in Figure 9.54.

Figure 9.54: The graph of a curve in space.

Thus, we can think of the curve as a collection of terminal points of vectors emanating from
the origin. We therefore view a point traveling along this curve as a function of time t, and define
a function r whose input is the variable t and whose output is the vector from the origin to the
point on the curve at time t. In so doing, we have introduced a new type of function, one whose
input is a scalar and whose output is a vector.
The terminal points of the vector outputs of r then trace out the curve in space. From this
perspective, the x, y, and z coordinates of the point are functions of time, t, say

x = x(t), y = y(t),

and

z = z(t),

and thus we have three coordinate functions that enable us to represent the curve. The variable t is
called a parameter and the equations x = x(t), y = y(t), and z = z(t) are called parametric equations
(or a parameterization of the curve). The function r whose output is the vector from the origin to a
point on the curve is defined by
r(t) = hx(t), y(t), z(t)i.
Note that the input of r is the real-valued parameter t and the corresponding output is vector
hx(t), y(t), z(t)i. Such a function is called a vector-valued function because each real number input

62

9.6. VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

generates a vector output. More formally, we state the following definition.
Definition 9.9. A vector-valued function is a function whose input is a real parameter t and
whose output is a vector that depends on t. The graph of a vector-valued function is the set of
all terminal points of the output vectors with their initial points at the origin.
Parametric equations for a curve are equations of the form
x = x(t), y = y(t),

and

z = z(t)

that describe the (x, y, z) coordinates of a point on a curve in R3 .

Note particularly that every set of parametric equations determines a vector-valued function
of the form
r(t) = hx(t), y(t), z(t)i,
and every vector-valued function defines a set of parametric equations for a curve. Moreover, we
can consider vector-valued functions and parameterizations in R2 , R4 , or indeed a real space of
any dimension. As a reminder, in Section 9.5, we determined the parametric equations of a line in
space using a point and a direction vector. For a nonlinear example, the curve in Figure 9.54 has
the parametric equations
x(t) = cos(t), y(t) = sin(t),

and z(t) = cos(t) sin(t).

Represented as a vector-valued function r, the curve in Figure 9.54 is the graph of
r(t) = hcos(t), sin(t), cos(t) sin(t)i.

Activity 9.23.
The same curve can be represented with different parameterizations. Use your calculator,8

(a) r(t) = hsin(t), cos(t)i
(b) r(t) = hsin(2t), cos(2t)i

If you have a graphing calculator you can draw graphs of vector-valued functions in R2 using the parametric mode
(often found in the MODE menu).

e.g., http://webspace.ship.edu/msrenault/ggb/parametric_grapher.html

9.6. VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

63

The examples in Activity 9.23 illustrate that a parameterization allows us to look not only at
the graph, but at the direction and speed at which the graph is traversed as t changes. In the
different parameterizations of the circle, we see that we can start at different points and move
around the circle in either direction. The calculus of vector-valued functions – which we will
begin to investigate in Section 9.7 – will enable us to precisely quantify the direction, speed, and
acceleration of a particle moving along a curve in space. As such, describing curves parametrically
will allow us to not only indicate the curve itself, but also to describe how motion occurs along
the curve.
Using parametric equations to define vector-valued functions in two dimensions is much more
versatile than just defining y as a function of x. In fact, if y = f (x) is a function of x, then we can
parameterize the graph of f by
r(t) = ht, f (t)i,
and thus every single-variable function may be described parametrically. In addition, as we saw
in Preview Activity 9.6 and Activity 9.23, we can use vector-valued functions to represent curves
in the plane that do not define y as a function of x (or x as a function of y).10

Activity 9.24.
Vector-valued functions can be used to generate many interesting curves. Graph each of the
following using an appropriate tool11 , and then write one sentence for each function to describe
the behavior of the resulting curve.
(a) r(t) = ht cos(t), t sin(t)i
(b) r(t) = hsin(t) cos(t), t sin(t)i
(c) r(t) = ht2 sin(t) cos(t), 0.9t cos(t2 ), sin(t)i
(d) r(t) = hsin(5t), sin(4t)i
(e) Experiment with different formulas for x(t) and y(t) and ranges for t to see what other
interesting curves you can generate. Share your best results with peers.
C
Recall from our earlier work that the traces and level curves of a function are themselves curves
in space. Thus, we may determine parameterizations for them. For example, if z = f (x, y) =
cos(x2 + y 2 ), the y = 1 trace of the function is given by setting y = 1 and letting x be parameterized
by the variable t; then, the trace is the curve whose parameterization is ht, 1, cos(t2 + 1)i.

Activity 9.25.

Consider the paraboloid defined by f (x, y) = x2 + y 2 .
10

As an aside, vector-valued functions make it easy to plot the inverse of a one-to-one function in two dimensions.
To see how, if y = f (x) defines a one-to-one function, then we can parameterize this function by r(t) = ht, f (t)i. Since
the inverse function just reverses the role of input and output, a parameterization for f −1 is hf (t), ti.

Summary
• A vector-valued function is a function whose input is a real parameter t and whose output is a
vector that depends on t. The graph of a vector-valued function is the set of all terminal points
of the output vectors with their initial points at the origin.
• Every vector-valued function provides a parameterization of a curve. In R2 , a parameterization
of a curve is a pair of equations x = x(t) and y = y(t) that describes the coordinates of a point
(x, y) on the curve in terms of a parameter t. In R3 , a parameterization of a curve is a set of
three equations x = x(t), y = y(t), and z = z(t) that describes the coordinates of a point (x, y, z)
on the curve in terms of a parameter t.

9.7. DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS OF VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

Derivatives and Integrals of Vector-Valued Functions

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What do we mean by the derivative of a vector-valued function and how do we calculate
it?
• What does the derivative of a vector-valued function measure?
• What do we mean by the integral of a vector-valued function and how do we compute it?
• How do we describe the motion of a projectile if the only force acting on the object is acceleration due to gravity?

Introduction
A vector-valued function r determines a curve in space as the collection of terminal points of the
vectors r(t). If the curve is smooth, it is natural to ask whether r(t) has a derivative. In the same
way, our experiences with integrals in single-variable calculus prompt us to wonder what the
integral of a vector-valued function might be and what it might tell us. We explore both of these
questions in detail in this section.
For now, let’s recall some important ideas from calculus I. Given a function s that measures
the position of an object moving along an axis, its derivative, s0 , is defined by
s(t + h) − s(t)
,
h→0
h

s0 (t) = lim

and measures the instantaneous rate of change of s with respect to time. In particular, for a fixed
value t = a, s0 (a) measures the velocity of the moving object, as well as the slope of the tangent
line to the curve y = s(t) at the point (a, s(a)).
As we work with vector-valued functions, we will strive to update these ideas and perspectives
into the context of curves in space and outputs that are vectors.
Preview Activity 9.7. Let r(t) = cos(t)i + sin(2t)j describe the path traveled by an object at time t.
(a) Use appropriate technology to help you sketch the graph of the vector-valued function r,
and then locate and label the point on the graph when t = π.
(b) Recall that for functions of a single variable, the derivative of a sum is the sum of the

The Derivative
In single variable calculus, we define the derivative, f 0 , of a given function f by
f (x + h) − f (x)
,
h→0
h

f 0 (x) = lim

provided the limit exists. At a given value of a, f 0 (a) measures the instantaneous rate of change
of f , and also tells us the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = f (x) at the point (a, f (a)). The
definition of the derivative extends naturally to vector-valued functions and curves in space.
Definition 9.10. The derivative of a vector-valued function r is defined to be
r0 (t) = lim

h→0

r(t + h) − r(t)
h

for those values of t at which the limit exists. We also use the notation

dr
dt

and

d
dt [r(t)]

for r0 (t).

Activity 9.26.
Let’s investigate how we can interpret the derivative r0 (t). Let r be the vector-valued function
whose graph is shown in Figure 9.55, and let h be a scalar that represents a small change in
time. The vector r(t) is the blue vector in Figure 9.55 and r(t + h) is the green vector.

As Activity 9.26 indicates, if r(t) determines the position of an object at time t, then r(t+h)−r(t)
h
represents the average rate of change in the position of the object over the interval [t, t + h], which
is also the average velocity of the object on this interval. Thus, the derivative
r0 (t) = lim

h→0

r(t + h) − r(t)
h

is the instantaneous rate of change of r(t) at time t (for those values of t for which the limit exists),
so r0 (t) = v(t) is the instantaneous velocity of the object at time t. Furthermore, we can interpret
the derivative r0 (t) as the direction vector of the line tangent to the graph of r at the value t.
Similarly,
v(t + h) − v(t)
h→0
h

v0 (t) = r00 (t) = lim

is the instantaneous rate of change of the velocity of the object at time t, for those values of t for
which the limits exists, and thus v0 (t) = a(t) is the acceleration of the moving object.

9.7. DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS OF VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

69

Note well: Both the velocity and acceleration are vector quantities: they have magnitude and
direction. By contrast, the magnitude of the velocity vector, |v(t)|, which is the speed of the object
at time t, is a scalar quantity.

Computing Derivatives
As we learned in single variable calculus, computing derivatives from the definition is often difficult. Fortunately, properties of the limit make it straightforward to calculate the derivative of a
vector-valued function similar to how we developed shortcut differentiation rules in calculus I.
To see why, recall that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, and that we can remove constant factors from limits. Thus, as we observed in a particular example in Preview Activity 9.7, if
r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, it follows that
r(t + h) − r(t)
h→0
h
[x(t + h) − x(t)]i + [y(t + h) − y(t)]j + [z(t + h) − z(t)]k

Thus, we can calculate the derivative of a vector-valued function by simply differentiating its
components.
If r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, then
d
r(t) = x0 (t)i + y 0 (t)j + z 0 (t)k

for those values of t at which x, y, and z are differentiable.

(d) r(t) = h t4 + 4, sin(3t), cos(4t)i.
C
In first-semester calculus, we developed several important differentiation rules, including the
constant multiple, product, quotient, and chain rules. For instance, recall that we formally state

70

9.7. DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS OF VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

the product rule as
d
[f (x) · g(x)] = f (x) · g 0 (x) + g(x) · f 0 (x).
dx
There are several analogous rules for vector-valued functions, including a product rule for scalar
functions and vector-valued functions. These rules, which are easily verified, are summarized in
the following theorem.
Theorem. Let f be a differentiable real-valued function of a real variable t and let r and s be
differentiable vector-valued functions of the real variable t. Then
1.

d
[r(t) + s(t)] = r0 (t) + s0 (t)

2.

d
[f (t)r(t)] = f (t)r0 (t) + f 0 (t)r(t)

3.

d
[r(t) · s(t)] = r0 (t) · s(t) + r(t) · s0 (t)

[r(t) × s(t)] = r0 (t) × s(t) + r(t) × s0 (t)
dt

5.

d
[r(f (t))] = f 0 (t)r0 (f (t)).
dt

Note well. When applying these properties, use care to interpret the quantities involved as
either scalars or vectors. For example, r(t) · s(t) defines a scalar function because we have taken
the dot product of two vector-valued functions. However, r(t) × s(t) defines a vector-valued
function since we have taken the cross product of two vector-valued functions.

Tangent Lines
One of the most important ideas in first-semester calculus is that a differentiable function is locally
linear: that is, when viewed up close, the curve generated by a differentiable function looks very
much like a line. Indeed, when we zoom in sufficiently far on a particular point, the curve looks
indistinguishable from its tangent line.
In the same way, we expect that a smooth curve in 3-space will be locally linear. In the following activity, we investigate how to find the tangent line to such a curve. Recall from our work in
Section 9.5 that the vector equation of a line that passes through the point at the tip of the vector
L0 = hx0 , y0 , z0 i in the direction of the vector u = ha, b, ci can be written as
L(t) = L0 + tu.
In parametric form, the line L is given by
x(t) = x0 + at, y(t) = y0 + bt, z(t) = z0 + ct.

Let
r(t) = cos(t)i − sin(t)j + tk.12
(a) Determine the coordinates of the point on the curve traced out by r(t) when t = π.
(b) Find a direction vector for the line tangent to the graph of r at the point where t = π.
(c) Find the parametric equations of the line tangent to the graph of r when t = π.
(d) Sketch a plot of the curve r(t) and its tangent line near the point where t = π. In
addition, include a sketch of r0 (π). What is the important role of r0 (π) in this activity?
C
We see that our work in Activity 9.29 can be generalized. Given a differentiable vector-valued
function r, the tangent line to the curve at the input value a is given by
L(t) = r(a) + tr0 (a).

(9.11)

Here we see that because the tangent line is determined entirely by a given point and direction,
the point is provided by the function r, evaluated at t = a, while the direction is provided by the
derivative, r0 , again evaluated at t = a. Note how analogous the formula for L(t) is to the tangent
line approximation from single-variable calculus: in that context, for a given function y = f (x) at
a value x = a, we found that the tangent line can be expressed by the linear function y = L(x)
whose formula is
L(x) = f (a) + f 0 (a)(x − a).
Equation (9.11) for the tangent line L(t) to the vector-valued function r(t) is nearly identical. Indeed, because there are multiple parameterizations for a single line, it is even possible13 to write
the parameterization as
L(t) = r(a) + (t − a)r0 (a).
(9.12)
As we will learn more in Chapter 10, a smooth surface in 3-space is also locally linear. That
means that the surface will look like a plane, which we call its tangent plane, as we zoom in on
the graph. It is possible to use tangent lines to traces of the surface to generate a formula for the
tangent plane; see Exercise 3 at the end of this section for more details.

Integrating a Vector-Valued Function
Recall from single variable calculus that an antiderivative of a function f of the independent
variR
able x is a function F that satisfies F 0 (x) = f (x). We then defined the indefinite integral f (x) dx
12
You can sketch the graph with Wolfram Alpha, the applet at http://gvsu.edu/s/LR, or some other appropriate
technology.
13
In Equation (9.11), L(0) = r(a), so the line’s parameterization “starts” at t = 0. When we write the parameterization
in the form of Equation (9.12), L(a) = r(a), so the line’s parameterization “starts” at t = a.

9.7. DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS OF VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

73

to be the general antiderivative of f . Recall that the general antiderivative includes an added constant C in order to indicate that the general antiderivative is in fact an entire family of functions.
We can do the similar work with vector-valued functions.
Definition 9.11. An antiderivative of a vector-valued function r is a vector-valued function R
such that
R0 (t) = r(t).
R
The indefinite integral r(t) dt of a vector-valued function r is the general antiderivative of r
and represents the collection of all antiderivatives of r.

The same reasoning that allows us to differentiate a vector-valued function componentwise
applies to integrating as well. Recall that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals and
also that we can remove constant factors from integrals. So, given r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, it
follows that we can integrate componentwise. Expressed more formally,
If r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, then

In light of being able to integrate and differentiate componentwise with vector-valued functions, we can solve many problems that are analogous to those we encountered in single-variable
calculus. For instance, recall problems where we were given an object moving along an axis with
velocity function v and an initial position s(0). In that context, we were able to differentiate v in
order to find acceleration, and integrate v and use the initial condition in order to find the position
function s. In the following activity, we explore similar ideas with vector-valued functions.

Projectile Motion
Any time that an object is launched into the air with a given velocity and launch angle, the path
the object travels is determined almost exclusively by the force of gravity. Whether in sports such
as archery or shotput, in military applications with artillery, or in important fields like firefighting,
it is important to be able to know when and where a launched projectile will land. We can use
our knowledge of vector-valued functions in order to completely determine the path traveled by
an object that is launched from a given position at a given angle from the horizontal with a given
initial velocity.

Figure 9.59: Projectile motion.
Assume we fire a projectile from a launcher and the only force acting on the fired object is the
force of gravity pulling down on the object. That is, we assume no effect due to spin, wind, or air
resistance. With these assumptions, the motion of the object will be planar, so we can also assume
that the motion occurs in two-dimensional space. Suppose we launch the object from an initial
position (x0 , y0 ) at an angle θ with the positive x-axis as illustrated in Figure 9.59, and that we fire
the object with an initial speed of v0 = |v(0)|, where v(t) is the velocity vector of the object at time
t. Assume g is the positive constant acceleration force due to gravity, which acts to pull the fired
object toward the ground (in the negative y direction). Note particularly that there is no external
force acting on the object to move it in the x direction.
We first observe that since gravity only acts in the downward direction and that the acceleration due to gravity is constant, the acceleration vector is h0, −gi. That is, a(t) = h0, −gi. We may
use this fact about acceleration, together with the initial position and initial velocity in order to

9.7. DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS OF VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

75

fully determine the position r(t) of the object at time t. In Exercise 5, you can work through the
details to show that the following general formula holds.
If an object is launched from a point (x0 , y0 ) with initial velocity v0 at an angle θ with the
horizontal, then the position of the object at time t is given by
D
E
g
r(t) = v0 cos(θ)t + x0 , − t2 + v0 sin(θ)t + y0 .

This assumes that the only force acting on the object is the acceleration g due to gravity.

Summary
• If r is a vector-valued function, then the derivative of r is defined by
r(t + h) − r(t)
h→0
h

r0 (t) = lim

for those values of t at which the limit exists, and is computed componentwise by the formula
r0 (t) = x0 (t)i + y 0 (t)j + z 0 (t)k
for those values of t at which x, y, and z are differentiable, where r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k.
• The derivative r0 (t) of the vector-valued function r tells us the instantaneous rate of change of
r with respect to time, t, which can be interpreted as a direction vector for the line tangent to
the graph of r at the point r(t), or also as the instantaneous velocity of an object traveling along
the graph defined by r(t) at time t.
• An antiderivative
of r is a vector-valued function R such that R0 (t) = r(t). The indefinite
R
integral r(t) dt of a vector-valued function r is the general antiderivative of r (which is a
collection of all of the antiderivatives of r, with any two antiderivatives differing by at most a
constant vector). Moreover, if r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, then

6. A central force is one that acts on an object so that the force F is parallel to the object’s position
r. Since Newton’s Second Law says that an object’s acceleration is proportional to the force
exerted on it, the acceleration a of an object moving under a central force will be parallel to
its position r. For instance, the Earth’s acceleration due to the gravitational force that the sun
exerts on the Earth is parallel to the Earth’s position vector as shown in Figure 9.60.

Arc Length and Curvature

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• How can a definite integral be used to measure the length of a curve in 2- or 3-space?
• Why is arc length useful as a parameter?
• What is the curvature of a curve?

Introduction
Given a space curve, there are two natural geometric questions one might ask: how long is the
curve and how much does it bend? In this section, we answer both questions by developing
techniques for measuring the length of a space curve as well as its curvature.
Preview Activity 9.8. In earlier investigations, we have used integration to calculate quantities
such as area, volume, mass, and work. We are now interested in determining the length of a space
curve.
Consider the smooth curve in 3-space defined by the vector-valued function r, where
r(t) = hx(t), y(t), z(t)i = hcos(t), sin(t), ti
for t in the interval [0, 2π]. Pictures of the graph of r are shown in Figure 9.61. We will use the
integration process to calculate the length of this curve. In this situation we partition the interval
[0, 2π] into n subintervals of equal length and let 0 = t0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tn = b be the endpoints
of the subintervals. We then approximate the length of the curve on each subinterval with some
related quantity that we can compute. In this case, we approximate the length of the curve on
each subinterval with the length of the segment connecting the endpoints. Figure 9.61 illustrates
the process in three different instances using increasing values of n.

Arc Length
Consider a smooth curve in 3-space that is parametrically described by the vector-valued function
r defined by r(t) = hx(t), y(t), z(t)i. Preview Activity 9.8 shows that to approximate the length of
the curve defined by r(t) as the values of t run over an interval [a, b], we partition the interval [a, b]
into n subintervals of equal length ∆t, with a = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = b as the endpoints of the
subintervals. On each subinterval, we approximate the length of the curve by the length of the line
segment connecting the endpoints. The points on the curve corresponding to t = ti−1 and t = ti
are (x(ti−1 ), y(ti−1 ), z(ti−1 )) and (x(ti ), y(ti ), z(ti )), respectively, so the length of the line segment
connecting these points is
p
(x(ti ) − x(ti−1 ))2 + (y(ti ) − y(ti−1 ))2 + (z(ti ) − z(ti−1 ))2 .
Now we add all of these approximations together to obtain an approximation to the length L of
the curve:
n p

L≈
(x(ti ) − x(ti−1 ))2 + (y(ti ) − y(ti−1 ))2 + (z(ti ) − z(ti−1 ))2 .

We now want to take the limit of this sum as n goes to infinity, but in its present form it might be
difficult to see how. We first introduce ∆t by multiplying by ∆t
∆t , and see that

Noting further that

If r(t) defines a smooth curve C on an interval [a, b], then the length L of C is given by

|r0 (t)| dt.

(9.14)

Note that formula (9.14) applies to curves in any dimensional space. Moreover, this formula
has a natural interpretation: if r(t) records the position of a moving object, then r0 (t) is the object’s
velocity and |r0 (t)| its speed. Formula (9.14) says that we simply integrate the speed of an object
traveling over the curve to find the distance traveled by the object, which is the same as the length
of the curve, just as in one-variable calculus.

Parameterizing With Respect To Arc Length
In addition to helping us to find the length of space curves, the expression for the length of a
curve enables us to find a natural parametrization of space curves in terms of arc length, as we
now explain.
Shown below in Figure 9.62 is a portion of the parabola y = x2 /2. Of course, this space curve
may be parametrized by the vector-valued function r defined by r(t) = ht, t2 /2i as shown on the
left, where we see the location at a few different times t. Notice that the points are not equally
spaced on the curve.
A more natural parameter describing the points along the space curve is the distance traveled
s as we move along the parabola starting at the origin. For instance, the right side of Figure 9.62
shows the points corresponding to various values of s. We call this an arc length parametrization.

To see that this is a more natural parametrization, consider an interstate highway cutting across
a state. One way to parametrize the curve defined by the highway is to drive along the highway
and record our position at every time, thus creating a function r. If we encounter an accident or
road construction, however, this parametrization might not be at all relevant to another person
driving the same highway. An arc length parametrization, however, is like using the mile markers
on the side of road to specify our position on the highway. If we know how far we’ve traveled
along the highway, we know exactly where we are.
If we begin with a parametrization of a space curve, we can modify it to find an arc length
parametrization, as we now describe. Suppose that the curve is parametrized by the vector-valued
function r = r(t) where t is in the interval [a, b]. We define the parameter s through the function
Z tp
s = L(t) =
(x0 (w))2 + (y 0 (w))2 + (z 0 (w))2 dw,
a

which measures the length along the curve from r(a) to r(t).
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus shows us that
p

= L0 (t) = (x0 (t))2 + (y 0 (t))2 + (z 0 (t))2 = |r0 (t)|
dt
and so

L(t) =

If we assume that
is never 0, then
> 0 for all t and s = L(t) is always increasing. This
should seem reasonable: unless we stop, the distance traveled along the curve increases as we
move along the curve.
Since s = L(t) is an increasing function, it is invertible, which means we may view the time t
as a function of the distance traveled; that is, we have the relationship t = L−1 (s). We then obtain
the arc length parametrization by composing r(t) with t = L−1 (s) to obtain r(s). Let’s illustrate
this with an example.
Example 9.1. Consider a circle of radius 5 in 2-space centered at the origin. We know that we can
parameterize this circle as
r(t) = h5 cos(t), 5 sin(t)i,
where t runs from 0 to 2π. We see that r0 (t) = h−5 sin(t), 5 cos(t)i, and hence |r0 (t)| = 5. It then
follows that
Z t
Z t

s = L(t) =
|r (w)| dw =
5 dw = 5t.

Since s = L(t) = 5t, we may solve for t in terms of s to obtain t = L−1 (s) = s/5. We then find the
arc length parametrization by composing

which means that we move along the curve with unit speed when we parameterize by arc length.

In this activity we parameterize a line in 2-space in terms of arc length. Consider the line with

These examples illustrate a general method. Of course, evaluating an arc length integral and
finding a formula for the inverse of a function can be difficult, so while this process is theoretically
possible, it is not always practical to parameterize a curve in terms of arc length. However, we can
guarantee that such a parameterization exists, and this observation plays an important role in the
next section.

Curvature
For a smooth space curve, the curvature measures how fast the curve is bending or changing direction at a given point. For example, we expect that a line should have zero curvature everywhere,
while a circle (which is bending the same at every point) should have constant curvature. Circles
with larger radii should have smaller curvatures.
To measure the curvature, we first need to describe the direction of the curve at a point. We
may do this using a continuously varying tangent vector to the curve, as shown in 9.63. The direction of the curve is then determined by the angle φ this tangent vector makes with a horizontal
vector, as shown in 9.64.
Informally speaking, the curvature will be the rate at which the angle φ is changing as we move
along the curve. Of course, this rate of change will depend on how we move along the curve; if
we move with a greater speed along the curve, then φ will change more rapidly. This is why the

speed limit is sometimes lowered when we enter a curve on a highway. In other words, the rate of
change of φ will depend on the parametrization we use to describe the space curve. To eliminate
this dependence on the parametrization, we choose to work with an arc length parametrization
r(s), which means we move along the curve with unit speed.
Using an arc length parametrization r(s), we define the tangent vector T(s) = r0 (s), and note
that |T(s)| = 1; that is, T(s) is a unit tangent vector. We then have T(s) = hcos(φ(s)), sin(φ(s))i,
which means that

Example 9.3. We should expect that the curvature of a line is 0 everywhere. To show that our
definition of curvature measures this correctly in 2-space, recall that (9.17) gives us the arc length
parameterization

Show that the curvature of this circle is the constant a1 . What can you say about the relationship
between the size of the radius of a circle and the value of its curvature? Why does this make
sense?
C
The definition of curvature relies on our ability to parameterize curves in terms of arc length.
Since we have seen that finding an arc length parametrization can be difficult, we would like to be
able to express the curvature in terms of a more general parametrization r(t).
To begin, we need to describe the vector T, which is a vector tangent to the curve having unit
length. Of course, the velocity vector r0 (t) is tangent to the curve; we simply need to normalize its
length to be one. This means that we may take
T(t) =

r0 (t)

There is another useful formula, given below, whose derivation is left for the exercises.
If r is a vector-valued function defining a smooth space curve C, and if r0 (t) is not zero and if
r00 (t) exists, then the curvature κ of C satisfies

r(t) = ha cos(t), b sin(t)i.

Find the curvature of the ellipse. Assuming 0 < b < a, at what points is the curvature
the greatest and at what points is the curvature the smallest? Does this agree with your
intuition?
(b) The standard helix has parameterization r(t) = cos(t)i + sin(t)j + tk. Find the curvature
of the helix. Does the result agree with your intuition?
C
The curvature has another interpretation. Recall that the tangent line to a curve at a point is the
line that best approximates the curve at that point. The curvature at a point on a curve describes
the circle that best approximates the curve at that point. Remembering that a circle of radius a
has curvature 1/a, then the circle that best approximates the curve near a point on a curve whose
curvature is κ has radius 1/κ and will be tangent to the tangent line at that point. This circle, called
the osculating circle of the curve at the point, is shown in Figure 9.65 for a portion of a parabola.

Summary
• The integration process shows that the length L of a smooth curve defined by r(t) on an interval
[a, b] is
Z b
L=
|r0 (t)| dt.

• Arc length is useful as a parameter because when we parameterize with respect to arc length,
we eliminate the role of speed in our calculation of curvature and the result is a measure that
depends only on the geometry of the curve and not on the parameterization of the curve.

Limits

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What do we mean by the limit of a function f of two variables at a point (a, b)?
• What techniques can we use to show that a function of two variables does not have a limit
at a point (a, b)?
• What does it mean for a function f of two variables to be continuous at a point (a, b)?

Introduction
In this section, we will study limits of functions of several variables, with a focus on limits of
functions of two variables. In single variable calculus, we studied the notion of limit, which turned
out to be a critical concept that formed the basis for the derivative and the definite integral. In this
section we will begin to understand how the concept of limit for functions of two variables is
similar to what we encountered for functions of a single variable. The limit will again be the
fundamental idea in multivariable calculus, and we will use this notion of the limit of a function
of several variables to define the important concept of differentiability later in this chapter. We
have already seen its use in the derivatives of vector-valued functions in Section 9.7.
Let’s begin by reviewing what we mean by the limit of a function of one variable. We say that
a function f has a limit L as x approaches a provided that we can make the values f (x) as close to
L as we like by taking x sufficiently close (but not equal) to a. We denote this behavior by writing
lim f (x) = L.

Limits of Functions of Two Variables
In Preview Activity 10.1, we recalled the notion of limit from single variable calculus and saw that
a similar concept applies to functions of two variables. Though we will focus on functions of two
variables, for the sake of discussion, all the ideas we establish here are valid for functions of any
number of variables. In a natural followup to our work in Preview Activity 10.1, we now formally

10.1. LIMITS

97

define what it means for a function of two variables to have a limit at a point.
Definition 10.1. Given a function f = f (x, y), we say that f has limit L as (x, y) approaches (a, b)
provided that we can make f (x, y) as close to L as we like by taking (x, y) sufficiently close
(but not equal) to (a, b). We write
lim

(x,y)→(a,b)

f (x, y) = L.

To investigate the limit of a single variable function, limx→a f (x), we often consider the behavior of f as x approaches a from the right and from the left. Similarly, we may investigate limits of
two-variable functions, lim(x,y)→(a,b) f (x, y) by considering the behavior of f as (x, y) approaches
(a, b) from various directions. This situation is more complicated because there are infinitely many
ways in which (x, y) may approach (a, b). In the next activity, we see how it is important to consider a variety of those paths in investigating whether or not a limit exists.

Based on these calculations, state whether f has a limit at (0, 0) and give an argument
supporting your statement. (Hint: The blank spaces in the table are there to help you
see the patterns.)
(c) Now let’s consider what happens if we restrict our attention to the x-axis; that is, consider what happens when y = 0. What is the behavior of f (x, 0) as x → 0? If we
approach (0, 0) by moving along the x-axis, what value do we find as the limit?
(d) What is the behavior of f along the line y = x when x > 0; that is, what is the value of
f (x, x) when x > 0? If we approach (0, 0) by moving along the line y = x in the first
quadrant (thus considering f (x, x) as x → 0, what value do we find as the limit?
(e) In general, if lim(x,y)→(0,0) f (x, y) = L, then f (x, y) approaches L as (x, y) approaches
(0, 0), regardless of the path we take in letting (x, y) → (0, 0). Explain what the last two
parts of this activity imply about the existence of lim(x,y)→(0,0) f (x, y).
(f) Shown below in Figure 10.6 is a set of contour lines of the function f . What is the
behavior of f (x, y) as (x, y) approaches (0, 0) along any straight line? How does this
observation reinforce your conclusion about the existence of lim(x,y)→(0,0) f (x, y) from
the previous part of this activity? (Hint: Use the fact that a non-vertical line has equation
y = mx for some constant m.)

As we have seen in Activity 10.1, if we approach (a, b) along two different paths and find that
f (x, y) has two different limits, we can conclude that lim(x,y)→(a,b) f (x, y) does not exist. This is
similar to the one-variable example f (x) = x/|x| as shown in 10.7; limx→0 f (x) does not exist
because we see different limits as x approaches 0 from the left and the right.

As a general rule, we have
If f (x, y) has two different limits as (x, y) approaches (a, b) along two different paths, then
lim(x,y)→(a,b) f (x, y) does not exist.
As the next activity shows, studying the limit of a two-variable function f by considering the
behavior of f along various paths can require subtle insights.

Activity 10.2.
Let’s consider the function g defined by
g(x, y) =

x2 y
x4 + y 2

and investigate the limit lim(x,y)→(0,0) g(x, y).
(a) What is the behavior of g on the x-axis? That is, what is g(x, 0) and what is the limit of
g as (x, y) approaches (0, 0) along the x-axis?
(b) What is the behavior of g on the y-axis? That is, what is g(0, y) and what is the limit of
g as (x, y) approaches (0, 0) along the y-axis?
(c) What is the behavior of g on the line y = mx? That is, what is g(x, mx) and what is the
limit of g as (x, y) approaches (0, 0) along the line y = mx?
(d) Based on what you have seen so far, do you think lim(x,y)→(0,0) g(x, y) exists? If so, what
do you think its value is?
(e) Now consider the behavior of g on the parabola y = x2 ? What is g(x, x2 ) and what is
the limit of g as (x, y) approaches (0, 0) along this parabola?

(f) State whether the limit lim(x,y)→(0,0) g(x, y) exists or not and provide a justification of
your statement.
C

This activity shows that we need to be careful when studying the limit of a two-variable functions by considering its behavior along different paths. If we find two different paths that result in
two different limits, then we may conclude that the limit does not exist. However, we can never
conclude that the limit of a function exists only by considering its behavior along different paths.
Generally speaking, concluding that a limit lim(x,y)→(a,b) f (x, y) exists requires a more careful
argument. For example, let’s consider the function f defined by
f (x, y) =

x2 y 2
x2 + y 2

and ask whether lim(x,y)→(0,0) f (x, y) exists.
Note that if either x or y is 0, then f (x, y) = 0. Therefore, if f has a limit at (0, 0), it must be 0.
We will therefore argue that
lim f (x, y) = 0,
(x,y)→(0,0)

by showing that we can make f (x, y) as close to 0 as we wish by taking (x, y) sufficiently close
(but not equal) to (0, 0). In what follows, we view x and y as being real numbers that are close, but
not equal, to 0.
Since 0 ≤ x2 , we have

y 2 ≤ x2 + y 2 ,

which implies that
y2
≤ 1.
x2 + y 2
Multiplying both sides by x2 and observing that f (x, y) ≥ 0 for all (x, y) gives
x2 y 2
0 ≤ f (x, y) = 2
= x2
x + y2



y2



≤ x2 .

This shows that we can make f (x, y) as close to 0 as we like by taking x sufficiently close to 0 (for
this example, it turns out that we don’t even need to worry about making y close to 0). Therefore,
x2 y 2
= 0.
(x,y)→(0,0) x2 + y 2

In spite of the fact that these two most recent examples illustrate some of the complications
that arise when studying limits of two-variable functions, many of the properties that are familiar

10.1. LIMITS

101

from our study of single variable functions hold in precisely the same way. For instance,
Properties of Limits. Let f = f (x, y) and g = g(x, y) be functions so that

g(x, y) 6= 0.

We can use these properties and results from single variable calculus to verify that many limits
exist. For example, these properties show that the function f defined by
f (x, y) = 3x2 y 3 + 2xy 2 − 3x + 1
has a limit at every point (a, b) and, moreover,
lim

(x,y)→(a,b)

f (x, y) = f (a, b).

The reason for this is that polynomial functions of a single variable have limits at every point.

Continuity
Recall that a function f of a single variable x is said to be continuous at x = a provided that the
following three conditions are satisfied:
1. f (a) exists,
2. limx→a f (x) exists, and
3. limx→a f (x) = f (a).
Using our understanding of limits of multivariable functions, we can define continuity in the same

102

10.1. LIMITS

way.
Definition 10.2. A function f = f (x, y) is continuous at the point (a, b) provided that
1. f is defined at the point (a, b),

3.

lim

f (x, y) exists, and

lim

f (x, y) = f (a, b).

(x,y)→(a,b)

(x,y)→(a,b)

For instance, we have seen that the function f defined by f (x, y) = 3x2 y 3 + 2xy 2 − 3x + 1
is continous at every point. And just as with single variable functions, continuity has certain
properties that are based on the properties of limits.
Properties of Continuity. Let f and g be functions of two variables that are continuous at the
point (a, b). Then
1. cf is continuous at (a, b) for any scalar c
2. f + g is continuous at (a, b)
3. f − g is continuous at (a, b)
4. f g is continuous at (a, b)
5.

f
g

is continuous at (a, b) if g(a, b) 6= 0

Using these properties, we can apply results from single variable calculus to decide about
continuity of multivariable functions. For example, the coordinate functions f and g defined by
f (x, y) = x and g(x, y) = y are continuous at every point. We can then use properties of continuity
listed to conclude that every polynomial function in x and y is continuous at every point. For
example, g(x, y) = x2 and h(x, y) = y 3 are continuous functions, so their product f (x, y) = x2 y 3 is
a continuous multivariable function.

Summary
• A function f = f (x, y) has a limit L at a point (a, b) provided that we can make f (x, y) as close
to L as we like by taking (x, y) sufficiently close (but not equal) to (a, b).
• If (x, y) has two different limits as (x, y) approaches (a, b) along two different paths, we can
conclude that lim(x,y)→(a,b) f (x, y) does not exist.
• Properties similar to those for one-variable functions allow us to conclude that many limits
exist and to evaluate them.

First-Order Partial Derivatives

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• How are the first-order partial derivatives of a function f of the independent variables x
and y defined?
• Given a function f of the independent variables x and y, what do the first-order partial
∂f
derivatives ∂f
∂x and ∂y tell us about f ?

Introduction
The derivative plays a central role in first semester calculus because it provides important information about a function. Thinking graphically, for instance, the derivative at a point tells us the
slope of the tangent line to the graph at that point. In addition, the derivative at a point also provides the instantaneous rate of change of the function with respect to changes in the independent
variable.
Now that we are investigating functions of two or more variables, we can still ask how fast the
function is changing, though we have to be careful about what we mean. Thinking graphically
again, we can try to measure how steep the graph of the function is in a particular direction.
Alternatively, we may want to know how fast a function’s output changes in response to a change
in one of the inputs. Over the next few sections, we will develop tools for addressing issues such
as these these. Preview Activity 10.2 explores some issues with what we will come to call partial
derivatives.
Preview Activity 10.2. Let’s return to the function we considered in Preview Activity 9.1. Suppose
we take out a $18,000 car loan at interest rate r and we agree to pay off the loan in t years. The
monthly payment, in dollars, is
M (r, t) =

1500r
1− 1+

.

r −12t
12

(a) What is the monthly payment if the interest rate is 3% so that r = 0.03, and we pay the
loan off in t = 4 years?
(b) Suppose the interest rate is fixed at 3%. Express M as a function f of t alone using r = 0.03.
That is, let f (t) = M (0.03, t). Sketch the graph of f on the left of Figure 10.8. Explain the
meaning of the function f .
(c) Find the instantaneous rate of change f 0 (4) and state the units on this quantity. What
information does f 0 (4) tell us about our car loan? What information does f 0 (4) tell us
about the graph you sketched in (b)?

./

First-Order Partial Derivatives
In Section 9.1, we studied the behavior of a function of two or more variables by considering the
traces of the function. Recall that in one example, we considered the function f defined by
f (x, y) =

x2 sin(2y)
,
32

which measures the range, or horizontal distance, in feet, traveled by a projectile launched with an
initial speed of x feet per second at an angle y radians to the horizontal. The graph of this function
is given again on the left in Figure 10.9. Moreover, if we fix the angle y = 0.6, we may view the
trace f (x, 0.6) as a function of x alone, as seen at right in Figure 10.9.
Since the trace is a one-variable function, we may consider its derivative just as we did in the
first semester of calculus. With y = 0.6, we have
f (x, 0.6) =
and therefore

which gives the slope of the tangent line shown on the right of Figure 10.9. Thinking of this derivative as an instantaneous rate of change implies that if we increase the initial speed of the projectile
by one foot per second, we expect the horizontal distance traveled to increase by approximately
8.74 feet if we hold the launch angle constant at 0.6 radians.
By holding y fixed and differentiating with respect to x, we obtain the first-order partial derivative of f with respect to x. Denoting this partial derivative as fx , we have seen that
fx (150, 0.6) =

d
f (150 + h, 0.6) − f (150, 0.6)
f (x, 0.6)|x=150 = lim

More generally, we have
fx (a, b) = lim

In the same way, we may obtain a trace by setting, say, x = 150 as shown in Figure 10.10. This
gives

f (150, y) =
sin(2y),

[f (150, y)]|y=0.6 =
cos(1.2) ≈ 509.5 feet per radian.

16
Once again, the derivative gives the slope of the tangent line shown on the right in Figure 10.10.
Thinking of the derivative as an instantaneous rate of change, we expect that the range of the

projectile increases by 509.5 feet for every radian we increase the launch angle y if we keep the
initial speed of the projectile constant at 150 feet per second.
By holding x fixed and differentiating with respect to y, we obtain the first-order partial derivative of f with respect to y. As before, we denote this partial derivative as fy and write
fy (150, 0.6) =

d
f (150, 0.6 + h) − f (150, 0.6)
f (150, y)|y=0.6 = lim

As with the partial derivative with respect to x, we may express this quantity more generally at
an arbitrary point (a, b). To recap, we have now arrived at the formal definition of the first-order
partial derivatives of a function of two variables.
Definition 10.3. The first-order partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y at a point (a, b)
are, respectively,
f (a + h, b) − f (a, b)
, and

As these examples show, each partial derivative at a point arises as the derivative of a onevariable function defined by fixing one of the coordinates. In addition, we may consider each partial derivative as defining a new function of the point (x, y), just as the derivative f 0 (x) defines a
new function of x in single-variable calculus. Due to the connection between one-variable derivatives and partial derivatives, we will often use Leibniz-style notation to denote partial derivatives
by writing
∂f
∂f
(a, b) = fx (a, b),
and
(a, b) = fy (a, b).
∂x
∂y
To calculate the partial derivative fx , we hold y fixed and thus we treat y as a constant. In
Leibniz notation, observe that

(x) = 1
∂x

and

∂
(y) = 0.

Interpretations of First-Order Partial Derivatives
Recall that the derivative of a single variable function has a geometric interpretation as the slope of
the line tangent to the graph at a given point. Similarly, we have seen that the partial derivatives
measure the slope of a line tangent to a trace of a function of two variables as shown in Figure
10.12.
Now we consider the first-order partial derivatives in context. Recall that the difference quo(a)
tient f (a+h)−f
for a function f of a single variable x at a point where x = a tells us the average
h
rate of change of f over the interval [a, a + h], while the derivative f 0 (a) tells us the instantaneous
rate of change of f at x = a. We can use these same concepts to explain the meanings of the partial
derivatives in context.

Using tables and contours to estimate partial derivatives
Remember that functions of two variables are often represented as either a table of data or a contour plot. In single variable calculus, we saw how we can use the difference quotient to approximate derivatives if, instead of an algebraic formula, we only know the value of the function at a
few points. The same idea applies to partial derivatives.

Activity 10.6.
The wind chill, as frequently reported, is a measure of how cold it feels outside when the wind
is blowing. In Table 10.1, the wind chill w, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, is a function of the
wind speed v, measured in miles per hour, and the ambient air temperature T , also measured
in degrees Fahrenheit. We thus view w as being of the form w = w(v, T ).
(a) Estimate the partial derivative wv (20, −10). What are the units on this quantity and

Summary
• If f = f (x, y) is a function of two variables, there are two first order partial derivatives of f : the
partial derivative of f with respect to x,
∂f
f (x + h, y) − f (x, y)
(x, y) = fx (x, y) = lim
,
h→0
∂x
h
and the partial derivative of f with respect to y,
∂f
f (x, y + h) − f (x, y)
(x, y) = fy (x, y) = lim
,
h→0
∂y
h
where each partial derivative exists only at those points (x, y) for which the limit exists.
• The partial derivative fx (a, b) tells us the instantaneous rate of change of f with respect to x at
(x, y) = (a, b) when y is fixed at b. Geometrically, the partial derivative fx (a, b) tells us the slope
of the line tangent to the y = b trace of the function f at the point (a, b, f (a, b)).

10.2. FIRST-ORDER PARTIAL DERIVATIVES

• The partial derivative fy (a, b) tells us the instantaneous rate of change of f with respect to y at
(x, y) = (a, b) when x is fixed at a. Geometrically, the partial derivative fy (a, b) tells us the slope
of the line tangent to the x = a trace of the function f at the point (a, b, f (a, b)).

Second-Order Partial Derivatives

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• Given a function f of two independent variables x and y, how are the second-order partial
derivatives of f defined?
• What do the second-order partial derivatives fxx , fyy , fxy , and fyx of a function f tell us
about the function’s behavior?

Introduction
Recall that for a single-variable function f , the second derivative of f is defined to be the derivative
d
[f 0 (x)], which can be stated in terms of the limit definition
of the first derivative. That is, f 00 (x) = dx
of the derivative by writing
f 0 (x + h) − f 0 (x)
f 00 (x) = lim
.
h→0

In what follows, we begin exploring the four different second-order partial derivatives of a function of two variables and seek to understand what these various derivatives tell us about the
function’s behavior.

Second-order Partial Derivatives
A function f of two independent variables x and y has two first order partial derivatives, fx and
fy . As we saw in Preview Activity 10.3, each of these first-order partial derivatives has two partial
derivatives, giving a total of four second-order partial derivatives:
• fxx = (fx )x =

The first two are called unmixed second-order partial derivatives while the last two are called
the mixed second-order partial derivatives.
One aspect of this notation can be a little confusing. The notation
 
∂2f
∂ ∂f
=
∂y∂x
∂y ∂x
means that we first differentiate with respect to x and then with respect to y; this can be expressed
in the alternate notation fxy = (fx )y . However, to find the second partial derivative
fyx = (fy )x
we first differentiate with respect to y and then x. This means that
∂2f
= fxy ,
∂y∂x

and

∂2f
= fyx .
∂x∂y

Be sure to note carefully the difference between Leibniz notation and subscript notation and the
order in which x and y appear in each. In addition, remember that anytime we compute a partial
derivative, we hold constant the variable(s) other than the one we are differentiating with respect
to.

Activity 10.8.
Find all second order partial derivatives of the following functions. For each partial derivative
you calculate, state explicitly which variable is being held constant.
(a) f (x, y) = x2 y 3
(b) f (x, y) = y cos(x)

(d) How many second order partial derivatives does the function h defined by h(x, y, z) =
9x9 z − xyz 9 + 9 have? Find hxz and hzx .
C

In Preview Activity 10.3 and Activity 10.8, you may have noticed that the mixed second-order
partial derivatives are equal. This observation holds generally and is known as Clairaut’s Theorem.
Clairaut’s Theorem. Let f be a function of two variables for which the partial derivatives fxy
and fyx are continuous near the point (a, b). Then
fxy (a, b) = fyx (a, b).

Interpreting the second-order Partial Derivatives
Recall from single variable calculus that the second derivative measures the instantaneous rate of
change of the derivative. This observation is the key to understanding the meaning of the secondorder partial derivatives.

Figure 10.19: The tangent lines to a trace with increasing x.
Furthermore, we remember that the second derivative of a function at a point provides us
with information about the concavity of the function at that point. Since the unmixed secondorder partial derivative fxx requires us to hold y constant and differentiate twice with respect to
x, we may simply view fxx as the second derivative of a trace of f where y is fixed. As such, fxx
will measure the concavity of this trace.
Consider, for example, f (x, y) = sin(x)e−y . Figure 10.19 shows the graph of this function along
with the trace given by y = −1.5. Also shown are three tangent lines to this trace, with increasing

x-values from left to right among the three plots in Figure 10.19.
That the slope of the tangent line is decreasing as x increases is reflected, as it is in one-variable
calculus, in the fact that the trace is concave down. Indeed, we see that fx (x, y) = cos(x)e−y and
so fxx (x, y) = − sin(x)e−y < 0, since e−y > 0 for all values of y, including y = −1.5.
In the following activity, we further explore what second-order partial derivatives tell us about
the geometric behavior of a surface.

Activity 10.9.
We continue to consider the function f defined by f (x, y) = sin(x)e−y .
(a) In Figure 10.20, we see the trace of f (x, y) = sin(x)e−y that has x held constant with
x = 1.75. Write a couple of sentences that describe whether the slope of the tangent

lines to this curve increase or decrease as y increases, and, after computing fyy (x, y),
explain how this observation is related to the value of fyy (1.75, y). Be sure to address
the notion of concavity in your response.
(b) In Figure 10.21, we start to think about the mixed partial derivative, fxy . Here, we
first hold y constant to generate the first-order partial derivative fx , and then we hold x
constant to compute fxy . This leads to first thinking about a trace with x being constant,
followed by slopes of tangent lines in the y-direction that slide along the original trace.
You might think of sliding your pencil down the trace with x constant in a way that
its slope indicates (fx )y in order to further animate the three snapshots shown in the
figure. Based on Figure 10.21, is fxy (1.75, −1.5) positive or negative? Why?
(c) Determine the formula for fxy (x, y), and hence evaluate fxy (1.75, −1.5). How does this

Just as with the first-order partial derivatives, we can approximate second-order partial derivatives in the situation where we have only partial information about the function.

As we have found in Activities 10.9 and 10.10, we may think of fxy as measuring the “twist”
of the graph as we increase y along a particular trace where x is held constant. In the same way,
fyx measures how the graph twists as we increase x. If we remember that Clairaut’s theorem tells
us that fxy = fyx , we see that the amount of twisting is the same in both directions. This twisting
is perhaps more easily seen in Figure 10.22, which shows the graph of f (x, y) = −xy, for which
fxy = −1.

Summary
• There are four second-order partial derivatives of a function f of two independent variables x
and y:
fxx = (fx )x , fxy = (fx )y , fyx = (fy )x , and fyy = (fy )y .
• The unmixed second-order partial derivatives, fxx and fyy , tell us about the concavity of the
traces. The mixed second-order partial derivatives, fxy and fyx , tell us how the graph of f
twists.

Linearization: Tangent Planes and Differentials

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What does it mean for a function of two variables to be locally linear at a point?
• How do we find the equation of the plane tangent to a locally linear function at a point?
• What does it mean to say that a multivariable function is differentiable?
• What is the differential of a multivariable function of two variables and what are its uses?

Introduction
One of the central concepts in single variable calculus is that the graph of a differentiable function,
when viewed on a very small scale, looks like a line. We call this line the tangent line and measure
its slope with the derivative. In this section, we will extend this concept to functions of several
variables.
Let’s see what happens when we look at the graph of a two-variable function on a small scale.
To begin, let’s consider the function f defined by
f (x, y) = 6 −

We choose to study the behavior of this function near the point (x0 , y0 ) = (1, 1). In particular,
we wish to view the graph on an increasingly small scale around this point, as shown in the two
plots in Figure 10.26

Just as the graph of a differentiable single-variable function looks like a line when viewed on
a small scale, we see that the graph of this particular two-variable function looks like a plane, as
seen in Figure 10.27. In the following preview activity, we explore how to find the equation of this
plane.

In what follows, we will also use the important fact1 that the plane passing through (x0 , y0 , z0 )
may be expressed in the form z = z0 + a(x − x0 ) + b(y − y0 ), where a and b are constants.
1
As we saw in Section 9.5, the equation of a plane passing through the point (x0 , y0 , z0 ) may be written in the form
A(x − x0 ) + B(y − y0 ) + C(z − z0 ) = 0. If the plane is not vertical, then C 6= 0, and we can rearrange this and hence
write C(z − z0 ) = −A(x − x0 ) − B(y − y0 ) and thus

this observation to determine z0 in the expression z = z0 + a(x − x0 ) + b(y − y0 ).

(e) Figure 10.29 shows the traces of the function and the traces of the tangent plane. Explain
how the tangent line of the trace of f , whose equation you found in the last part of this
activity, is related to the tangent plane. How does this observation help you determine the
constant a in the equation for the tangent plane z = z0 + a(x − x0 ) + b(y − y0 )? (Hint: How
do you think fx (x0 , y0 ) should be related to zx (x0 , y0 )?)
(f) In a similar way to what you did in (d), determine the equation of the tangent line of the
trace with x = 1 at the point y0 = 1. Explain how this tangent line is related to the tangent
plane, and use this observation to determine the constant b in the equation for the tangent
plane z = z0 + a(x − x0 ) + b(y − y0 ). (Hint: How do you think fy (x0 , y0 ) should be related
to zy (x0 , y0 )?)
(g) Finally, write the equation z = z0 + a(x − x0 ) + b(y − y0 ) of the tangent plane to the graph
of f (x, y) = 6 − x2 /2 − y 2 at the point (x0 , y0 ) = (1, 1).
C

The tangent plane
Before stating the formula for the equation of the tangent plane at a point for a general function
f = f (x, y), we need to discuss a mild technical condition. As we have noted, when we look at
the graph of a single-variable function on a small scale near a point x0 , we expect to see a line; in
this case, we say that f is locally linear near x0 since the graph looks like a linear function locally
around x0 . Of course, there are functions, such as the absolute value function given by f (x) = |x|,
that are not locally linear at every point. In single-variable calculus, we learn that if the derivative
of a function exists at a point, then the function is guaranteed to be locally linear there.
In a similar way, we say that a two-variable function f is locally linear near (x0 , y0 ) provided
that the graph of f looks like a plane when viewed on a small scale near (x0 , y0 ). There are, of
course, functions that are not locally linear at some points (x0 , y0 ). However, it turns out that if
the first-order partial derivatives, fx and fy , are continuous near (x0 , y0 ), then f is locally linear at
(x0 , y0 ) and the graph looks like a plane, which we call the tangent plane, when viewed on a small
scale. Moreover, when a function is locally linear at a point, we will also say it is differentiable at
that point.
If f is a function of the independent variables x and y and both fx and fy exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point (x0 , y0 ), then f is differentiable at (x0 , y0 ).
So, whenever a function z = f (x, y) is differentiable at a point (x0 , y0 ), it follows that the
function has a tangent plane at (x0 , y0 ). Viewed up close, the tangent plane and the function are
then virtually indistinguishable. In addition, as in Preview Activity 10.4, we find the following

10.4. LINEARIZATION: TANGENT PLANES AND DIFFERENTIALS

131

general formula for the tangent plane.
If f (x, y) has continuous first-order partial derivatives, then the equation of the plane tangent
to the graph of f at the point (x0 , y0 , f (x0 , y0 )) is
z = f (x0 , y0 ) + fx (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + fy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ).

(10.1)

Finally, one important note about the form of the equation for the tangent plane, z = f (x0 , y0 )+
fx (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + fy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ). Say, for example, that we have the particular tangent plane
z = 7−2(x−3)+4(y+1). Observe that we can immediately read from this form that fx (3, −1) = −2
and fy (3, −1) = 4; furthermore, fx (3, −1) = −2 is the slope of the trace to both f and the tangent
plane in the x-direction at (−3, 1). In the same way, fy (3, −1) = 4 is the slope of the trace of both
f and the tangent plane in the y-direction at (3, −1).

Find the equation of the tangent plane to f (x, y) = x2 y at the point (1, 2).
C

Linearization
In single variable calculus, an important use of the tangent line is to approximate the value of a
differentiable function. Near the point x0 , the tangent line to the graph of f at x0 is close to the
graph of f near x0 , as shown in Figure 10.30.

In this single-variable setting, we let L denote the function whose graph is the tangent line,
and thus
L(x) = f (x0 ) + f 0 (x0 )(x − x0 )

132

10.4. LINEARIZATION: TANGENT PLANES AND DIFFERENTIALS

Furthermore, observe that f (x) ≈ L(x) near x0 . We call L the linearization of f .

In the same way, the tangent plane to the graph of a differentiable function z = f (x, y) at
a point (x0 , y0 ) provides a good approximation of f (x, y) near (x0 , y0 ). Here, we define the linearization, L, to be the two-variable function whose graph is the tangent plane, and thus
L(x, y) = f (x0 , y0 ) + fx (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + fy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ).
Finally, note that f (x, y) ≈ L(x, y) for points near (x0 , y0 ). This is illustrated in Figure 10.31.

linearization L(v, T ) at the point (25, −10). Finally, use the linearization to estimate
w(25, −12), w(23, −10), and w(23, −12).

Differentials
As we have seen, the linearization L(x, y) enables us to estimate the value of f (x, y) for points
(x, y) near the base point (x0 , y0 ). Sometimes, however, we are more interested in the change in f
as we move from the base point (x0 , y0 ) to another point (x, y).
Figure 10.33 illustrates this situation. Suppose we are at the point (x0 , y0 ), and we know the
value f (x0 , y0 ) of f at (x0 , y0 ). If we consider the displacement h∆x, ∆yi to a new point (x, y) =
(x0 + ∆x, y0 + ∆y), we would like to know how much the function has changed. We denote this
change by ∆f , where
∆f = f (x, y) − f (x0 , y0 ).
A simple way to estimate the change ∆f is to approximate it by df , which represents the change

in the linearization L(x, y) as we move from (x0 , y0 ) to (x, y). This gives
∆f ≈ df = L(x, y) − f (x0 , y0 )

= [f (x0 , y0 ) + fx (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + fy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 )] − f (x0 , y0 )
= fx (x0 , y0 )∆x + fy (x0 , y0 )∆y.

For consistency, we will denote the change in the independent variables as dx = ∆x and dy = ∆y,
and thus
∆f ≈ df = fx (x0 , y0 ) dx + fy (x0 , y0 ) dy.

Expressed equivalently in Leibniz notation, we have

(10.3)

We call the quantities dx, dy, and df differentials, and we think of them as measuring small
changes in the quantities x, y, and f . Equations (10.2) and (10.3) express the relationship between
these changes. Equation (10.3) resembles an important idea from single-variable calculus: when y
depends on x, it follows in the notation of differentials that
dy = y 0 dx =

dy
dx.
dx

We will illustrate the use of differentials with an example. Suppose we have a machine that
manufactures rectangles of width x = 20 cm and height y = 10 cm. However, the machine isn’t
perfect, and therefore the width could be off by dx = ∆x = 0.2 cm and the height could be off by
dy = ∆y = 0.4 cm.
The area of the rectangle is
A(x, y) = xy,
so that the area of a perfectly manufactured rectangle is A(20, 10) = 200 square centimeters. Since
the machine isn’t perfect, we would like to know how much the area of a given manufactured

10.4. LINEARIZATION: TANGENT PLANES AND DIFFERENTIALS

135

rectangle could differ from the perfect rectangle. We will estimate the uncertainty in the area
using (10.2), and find that
∆A ≈ dA = Ax (20, 10) dx + Ay (20, 10) dy.
Since Ax = y and Ay = x, we have
∆A ≈ dA = 10 dx + 20 dy = 10 · 0.2 + 20 · 0.4 = 10.
That is, we estimate that the area in our rectangles could be off by as much as 10 square centimeters.

Activity 10.13.
The questions in this activity explore the differential in several different contexts.
(a) Suppose that the elevation of a landscape is given by the function h, where we additionally know that h(3, 1) = 4.35, hx (3, 1) = 0.27, and hy (3, 1) = −0.19. Assume that x
and y are measured in miles in the easterly and northerly directions, respectively, from
some base point (0, 0).
Your GPS device says that you are currently at the point (3, 1). However, you know
that the coordinates are only accurate to within 0.2 units; that is, dx = ∆x = 0.2 and
dy = ∆y = 0.2. Estimate the uncertainty in your elevation using differentials.
(b) The pressure, volume, and temperature of an ideal gas are related by the equation
P = P (T, V ) = 8.31T /V,
where P is measured in kilopascals, V in liters, and T in kelvin. Find the pressure
when the volume is 12 liters and the temperature is 310 K. Use differentials to estimate
the change in the pressure when the volume increases to 12.3 liters and the temperature
decreases to 305 K.
(c) Refer to Table 10.3, the table of values of the wind chill w(v, T ), in degrees Fahrenheit,
as a function of temperature, also in degrees Fahrenheit, and wind speed, in miles per
hour.
Suppose your anemometer says the wind is blowing at 25 miles per hour and your
thermometer shows a reading of −15◦ degrees. However, you know your thermometer
is only accurate to within 2◦ degrees and your anemometer is only accurate to within
3 miles per hour. What is the wind chill based on your measurements? Estimate the
uncertainty in your measurement of the wind chill.

Summary
• A function f of two independent variables is locally linear at a point (x0 , y0 ) if the graph of
f looks like a plane as we zoom in on the graph around the point (x0 , y0 ). In this case, the
equation of the tangent plane is given by
z = f (x0 , y0 ) + fx (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + fy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ).

10.4. LINEARIZATION: TANGENT PLANES AND DIFFERENTIALS

• The tangent plane L(x, y) = f (x0 , y0 ) + fx (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + fy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ), when considered
as a function, is called the linearization of a differentiable function f at (x0 , y0 ) and may be used
to estimate values of f (x, y); that is, f (x, y) ≈ L(x, y) for points (x, y) near (x0 , y0 ).
• A function f of two independent variables is differentiable at (x0 , y0 ) provided that both fx and
fy exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point (x0 , y0 ).
• The differential df of a function f = f (x, y) is related to the differentials dx and dy by
df = fx (x0 , y0 )dx + fy (x0 , y0 )dy.
We can use this relationship to approximate small changes in f that result from small changes
in x and y.

at the point (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 0). Hence use the linearization to estimate the value of
f (0.1, 0.2). Compare your estimate to the actual value of f (0.1, 0.2).
(b) The Heat Index, I, (measured in apparent degrees F) is a function of the actual temperature T outside (in degrees F) and the relative humidity H (measured as a percentage).

The Chain Rule

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What is the Chain Rule and how do we use it to find a derivative?
• How can we use a tree diagram to guide us in applying the Chain Rule?

Introduction
In single-variable calculus, we encountered situations in which some quantity z depends on y and,
in turn, y depends on x. A change in x produces a change in y, which consequently produces a
change in z. Using the language of differentials that we saw in the previous section, these changes
are naturally related by
dz
dy
dz =
dy
and
dy =
dx.
dy
dx
In terms of instantaneous rates of change, we then have
dz =

dz dy
dz
dx =
dx
dy dx
dx

and thus

dz
dz dy
=
.
dx
dy dx
This most recent equation we call the Chain Rule.
In the case of a function f of two variables where z = f (x, y), it might be that both x and y
depend on another variable t. A change in t then produces changes in both x and y, which then
cause z to change. In this section we will see how to find the change in z that is caused by a
change in t, leading us to multivariable versions of the Chain Rule involving both regular and
partial derivatives.
Preview Activity 10.5. Suppose you are driving around in the x-y plane in such a way that your
position r(t) at time t is given by function
r(t) = hx(t), y(t)i = h2 − t2 , t3 + 1i.
The path taken is shown on the left of Figure 10.35.
Suppose, furthermore, that the temperature at a point in the plane is given by

1
1
T (x, y) = 10 − x2 − y 2 ,
2
5
and note that the surface generated by T is shown on the right of Figure 10.35. Therefore, as time
passes, your position (x(t), y(t)) changes, and, as your position changes, the temperature T (x, y)
also changes.

Figure 10.35: At left, your position in the plane; at right, the corresponding temperature.
(a) The position function r provides a parameterization x = x(t) and y = y(t) of the position
at time t. By substituting x(t) for x and y(t) for y in the formula for T , we can write
T = T (x(t), y(t)) as a function of t. Make these substitutions to write T as a function of
t and then use the Chain Rule from single variable calculus to find dT
dt . (Do not do any
algebra to simplify the derivative, either before taking the derivative, nor after.)
(b) Now we want to understand how the result from part (a) can be obtained from T as a
multivariable function. Recall from the previous section that small changes in x and y
produce a change in T that is approximated by
∆T ≈ Tx ∆x + Ty ∆y.
The Chain Rule tells us about the instantaneous rate of change of T , and this can be found
as
Tx ∆x + Ty ∆y

a change in t is

(c) Using the original formulas for T , x, and y in the problem statement, calculate all of the
derivatives in Equation (10.5) (with Tx and Ty in terms of x and y, and x0 and y 0 in terms
of t), and hence write the right-hand side of Equation (10.5) in terms of x, y, and t.
(d) Compare the results of parts (a) and (c). Write a couple of sentences that identify specifically how each term in (c) relates to a corresponding terms in (a). This connection between
parts (a) and (c) provides a multivariable version of the Chain Rule.

10.5. THE CHAIN RULE

141

The Chain Rule
As Preview Activity 10.3 suggests, the following version of the Chain Rule holds in general.
Let z = f (x, y), where f is a differentiable function of the independent variables x and y, and
let x and y each be differentiable functions of an independent variable t. Then
dz
∂z dx ∂z dy
=
+
.
dt
∂x dt
∂y dt

(10.6)

It is important to note the differences among the derivatives in (10.6). Since z is a function
of the two variables x and y, the derivatives in the Chain Rule for z with respect to x and y are
partial derivatives. However, since x = x(t) and y = y(t) are functions of the single variable t,
their derivatives are the standard derivatives of functions of one variable. When we compose z
with x(t) and y(t), we then have z as a function of the single variable t, making the derivative of z
with respect to t a standard derivative from single variable calculus as well.
To understand why this Chain Rule works in general, suppose that some quantity z depends
on x and y so that
∂z

dz =
dx +

Next, suppose that x and y each depend on another quantity t, so that
dx =

and

which is the Chain Rule in this particular context, as expressed in Equation 10.6.

In the following questions, we apply the recently-developed Chain Rule in several different
contexts.
(a) Suppose that we have a function z defined by z(x, y) = x2 + xy 3 . In addition, suppose
that x and y are restricted to points that move around the plane by following a circle of
radius 2 centered at the origin that is parameterized by
x(t) = 2 cos(t),

and

y(t) = 2 sin(t).

(b) Suppose that the temperature on a metal plate is given by the function T with

where the temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and x and y are each measured in feet.
i. Find Tx and Ty . What are the units on these partial derivatives?
ii. Suppose an ant is walking along the x-axis at the rate of 2 feet per minute toward
the origin. When the ant is at the point (2, 0), what is the instantaneous rate of

response.
iii. Suppose instead that the ant walks along an ellipse with x = 6 cos(t) and y =

What does this seem to tell you about the path along which the ant is walking?
(c) Suppose that you are walking along a surface whose elevation is given by a function
f . Furthermore, suppose that if you consider how your location corresponds to points
in the x-y plane, you know that when you pass the point (2, 1), your velocity vector is
v = h−1, 2i. If some contours of f are as shown in Figure 10.36, estimate the rate of
change df /dt when you pass through (2, 1).

Tree Diagrams
Up to this point, we have applied the Chain Rule to situations where we have a function z of
variables x and y, with both x and y depending on another single quantity t. We may apply
the Chain Rule, however, when x and y each depend on more than one quantity, or when z is a
function of more than two variables. It can be challenging to keep track of all the dependencies

10.5. THE CHAIN RULE

143

among the variables, and thus a tree diagram can be a useful tool to organize our work. For
example, suppose that z depends on x and y, and x and y both depend on t. We may represent
these relationships using the tree diagram shown at left Figure 10.37. We place the dependent
variable at the top of the tree and connect it to the variables on which it depends one level below.
We then connect each of those variables to the variable on which each depends.

To represent the Chain Rule, we label every edge of the diagram with the appropriate derivative or partial derivative, as seen at right in Figure 10.37. To calculate an overall derivative according to the Chain Rule, we construct the product of the derivatives along all paths connecting the

Directional Derivatives and the Gradient

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• The partial derivatives of a function f tell us the rate of change of f in the direction of the
coordinate axes. How can we measure the rate of change of f in other directions?
• What is the gradient of a function and what does it tell us?

Introduction
The partial derivatives of a function tell us the instantaneous rate at which the function changes as
we hold all but one independent variable constant and allow the remaining independent variable
to change. It is natural to wonder how we can measure the rate at which a function changes in
directions other than parallel to a coordinate axes. In what follows, we investigate this question,
and see how the rate of change in any given direction is connected to the rates of change given by
the standard partial derivatives.
Preview Activity 10.6. Let’s consider the function f defined by

f (x, y) = 30 − x2 − y 2 ,

and suppose that f measures the temperature, in degrees Celsius, at a given point in the plane,
where x and y are measured in feet. Assume that the positive x-axis points due east, while the
positive y-axis points due north. A contour plot of f is shown in Figure 10.40

are the units on this rate of change?
(b) Next, determine the instantaneous rate of change of temperature at the point (2, 1) if the
person is instead walking due north. Again, include units on your result.
(c) Now, rather than walking due east or due north, let’s suppose that the person is walking
with velocity given by the vector v = h3, 4i, where time is measured in seconds. Note that
the person’s speed is thus |v| = 5 feet per second.
Find parametric equations for the person’s path; that is, parameterize the line through
(2, 1) using the direction vector v = h3, 4i. Let x(t) denote the x-coordinate of the line, and
y(t) its y-coordinate.
(d) With the parameterization in (c), we can now view the temperature f as not only a function
of x and y, but also of time, t. Hence, use the chain rule to determine the value of df
dt t=0 .
What are the units on your answer? What is the practical meaning of this result?

Directional Derivatives
Given a function z = f (x, y), the partial derivative fx (x0 , y0 ) measures the instantaneous rate of
change of f as only the x variable changes; likewise, fy (x0 , y0 ) measures the rate of change of f at
(x0 , y0 ) as only y changes. Note particularly that fx (x0 , y0 ) is measured in “units of f per unit of
change in x,” and that the units on fy (x0 , y0 ) are similar.
In Preview Activity 10.6, we saw how we could measure the rate of change of f in a situation
where both x and y were changing; in that activity, however, we found that this rate of change was
measured in “units of f per unit of time.” In a given unit of time, we may move more than one
unit of distance. In fact, in Preview Activity 10.6, in each unit increase in time we move a distance
of |v| = 5 feet. To generalize the notion of partial derivatives to any direction of our choice, we
instead want to have a rate of change whose units are “units of f per unit of distance in the given
direction.”
In this light, in order to formally define the derivative in a particular direction of motion, we
want to represent the change in f for a given unit change in the direction of motion. We can
represent this unit change in direction with a unit vector, say u = hu1 , u2 i. If we move a distance h
in the direction of u from a fixed point (x0 , y0 ), we then arrive at the new point (x0 +u1 h, y0 +u2 h).
It now follows that the slope of the secant line to the curve on the surface through (x0 , y0 ) in the
direction of u through the points (x0 , y0 ) and (x0 + u1 h, y0 + u2 h) is
msec =

f (x0 + u1 h, y0 + u2 h) − f (x0 , y0 )
.
h

(10.9)

10.6. DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES AND THE GRADIENT

149

To get the instantaneous rate of change of f in the direction u = hu1 , u2 i, we must take the
limit of the quantity in Equation (10.9) as h → 0. Doing so results in the formal definition of the
directional derivative.
Definition 10.4. Let f = f (x, y) be given. The derivative of f at the point (x, y) in the direction of the unit vector u = hu1 , u2 i is denoted Du f (x, y) and is given by
Du f (x, y) = lim

h→0

f (x + u1 h, y + u2 h) − f (x, y)
h

(10.10)

for those values of x and y for which the limit exists.

The quantity Du f (x, y) is called a directional derivative. When we evaluate the directional
derivative Du f (x, y) at a point (x0 , y0 ), the result Du f (x0 , y0 ) tells us the instantaneous rate at
which f changes at (x0 , y0 ) per unit increase in the direction of the vector u. In addition, the quantity Du f (x0 , y0 ) tells us the slope of the line tangent to the surface in the direction of u at the point
(x0 , y0 , f (x0 , y0 )).

Computing the Directional Derivative
In a similar way to how we developed shortcut rules for standard derivatives in single variable
calculus, and for partial derivatives in multivariable calculus, we can also find a way to evaluate
directional derivatives without resorting to the limit definition found in Equation (10.10). We do
so using a very similar approach to our work in Preview Activity 10.6.
Suppose we consider the situation where we are interested in the instantaneous rate of change
of f at a point (x0 , y0 ) in the direction u = hu1 , u2 i, where u is a unit vector. The variables x and y
are therefore changing according to the parameterization
x = x0 + u1 t

and

y = y0 + u2 t.

dy
Observe that dx
dt = u1 and dt = u2 for all values of t. Since u is a unit vector, it follows that a
point moving along this line moves one unit of distance per one unit of time; that is, each single
unit of time corresponds to movement of a single unit of distance in that direction. This observation allows us to use the Chain Rule to calculate the directional derivative, which measures the
instantaneous rate of change of f with respect to change in the direction u.

In particular, by the Chain Rule, it follows that
Du f (x0 , y0 ) = fx (x0 , y0 )

dx

+fy (x0 , y0 )

= fx (x0 , y0 )u1 + fy (x0 , y0 )u2 .

This now allows us to compute the directional derivative at an arbitrary point according to the

150

10.6. DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES AND THE GRADIENT

following formula.
Given a differentiable function f = f (x, y) and a unit vector u = hu1 , u2 i, we may compute
Du f (x, y) by
Du f (x, y) = fx (x, y)u1 + fy (x, y)u2 .
(10.11)
Note well: To use Equation (10.11), we must have a unit vector u = hu1 , u2 i in the direction of
motion. In the event that we have a direction prescribed by a non-unit vector, we must first scale
the vector to have length 1.

Activity 10.16.
Let f (x, y) = 3xy − x2 y 3 .
(a) Determine fx (x, y) and fy (x, y).
(b) Use Equation (10.11) to determine Di f (x, y) and Dj f (x, y). What familiar function is
Di f ? What familiar function is Dj f ?
(c) Use Equation (10.11) to find the derivative of f in the direction of the vector v = h2, 3i
at the point (1, −1). Remember that a unit direction vector is needed.
C

The Gradient
Via the Chain Rule, we have seen that for a given function f = f (x, y), its instantaneous rate of
change in the direction of a unit vector u = hu1 , u2 i is given by
Du f (x0 , y0 ) = fx (x0 , y0 )u1 + fy (x0 , y0 )u2 .

(10.12)

Recalling that the dot product of two vectors v = hv1 , v2 i and u = hu1 , u2 i is computed by
v · u = v1 u1 + v2 u2 ,
we see that we may recast Equation (10.12) in a way that has geometric meaning. In particular, we
see that Du f (x0 , y0 ) is the dot product of the vector hfx (x0 , y0 ), fy (x0 , y0 )i and the vector u.
We call this vector formed by the partial derivatives of f the gradient of f and denote it
∇f (x0 , y0 ) = hfx (x0 , y0 ), fy (x0 , y0 )i .
We read ∇f as “the gradient of f ,” “grad f ” or “del f ”.4 Notice that ∇f varies from point to point.
In the following activity, we investigate some of what the gradient tells us about the behavior of a
function f .

1/4.
• (x0 , y0 ) = (2, 0)
• (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 2)
• (x0 , y0 ) = (2, 2)
• (x0 , y0 ) = (2, 1)

• (x0 , y0 ) = (−3, 2)

• (x0 , y0 ) = (−2, −4)
• (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 0)

(c) What do you notice about the relationship between the gradient at (x0 , y0 ) and the contour line passing through that point?
(d) Does f increase or decrease in the direction of ∇f (x0 , y0 )? Provide a justification for
your response.
C
As a vector, ∇f (x0 , y0 ) defines a direction and a length. As we will soon see, both of these
convey important information about the behavior of f near (x0 , y0 ).

152

10.6. DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES AND THE GRADIENT

The Direction of the Gradient
Remember that the dot product also conveys information about the angle between the two vectors.
If θ is the angle between ∇f (x0 , y0 ) and u (where u is a unit vector), then we also have that
Du f (x0 , y0 ) = ∇f (x0 , y0 ) · u = |∇f (x0 , y0 )||u| cos(θ).
In particular, when θ is a right angle, as shown on the left of Figure 10.42, then Du f (x0 , y0 ) =
0, because cos(θ) = 0. Since the value of the directional derivative is 0, this means that f is
unchanging in this direction, and hence u must be tangent to the contour of f that passes through
(x0 , y0 ). In other words, ∇f (x0 , y0 ) is orthogonal to the contour through (x0 , y0 ). This shows that
the gradient vector at a given point is always perpendicular to the contour passing through the
point, confirming that what we saw in part (c) of Activity 10.17 holds in general.

Figure 10.42: The sign of Du f (x0 , y0 ) is determined by θ.
Moreover, when θ is an acute angle, it follows that cos(θ) > 0 so since
Du f (x0 , y0 ) = |∇f (x0 , y0 )||u| cos(θ),
and therefore Du f (x0 , y0 ) > 0, as shown in the middle image in Figure 10.42. This means that f
is increasing in any direction where θ is acute. In a similar way, when θ is an obtuse angle, then
cos(θ) < 0 so Du f (x0 , y0 ) < 0, as seen on the right in Figure 10.42. This means that f is decreasing
in any direction for which θ is obtuse.
Finally, as we can see in the following activity, we may also use the gradient to determine the
directions in which the function is increasing and decreasing most rapidly.

Activity 10.18.
In this activity we investigate how the gradient is related to the directions of greatest increase
and decrease of a function. Let f be a differentiable function and u a unit vector.
(a) Let θ be the angle between ∇f (x0 , y0 ) and u. Explain why
Du f (x0 , y0 ) = |hfx (x0 , y0 ), fy (x0 , y0 )i| cos(θ).

10.6. DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES AND THE GRADIENT

(b) At the point (x0 , y0 ), the only quantity in Equation (10.13) that can change is θ (which
determines the direction u of travel). Explain why θ = 0 makes the quantity
|hfx (x0 , y0 ), fy (x0 , y0 )i| cos(θ)
as large as possible.
(c) When θ = 0, in what direction does the unit vector u point relative to ∇f (x0 , y0 )? Why?
What does this tell us about the direction of greatest increase of f at the point (x0 , y0 )?
(d) In what direction, relative to ∇f (x0 , y0 ), does f decrease most rapidly at the point
(x0 , y0 )?
(e) State the unit vectors u and v (in terms of ∇f (x0 , y0 )) that provide the directions of
greatest increase and decrease for the function f at the point (x0 , y0 ). What important
assumption must we make regarding ∇f (x0 , y0 ) in order for these vectors to exist?
C

The Length of the Gradient
Having established in Activity 10.18 that the direction in which a function increases most rapidly
at a point (x0 , y0 ) is the unit vector u in the direction of the gradient, (that is, u = |∇f (x10 ,y0 )| ∇f (x0 , y0 ),
provided that ∇f (x0 , y0 ) 6= 0), it is also natural to ask, “in the direction of greatest increase for f
at (x0 , y0 ), what is the value of the rate of increase?” In this situation, we are asking for the value
of Du f (x0 , y0 ) where u = |∇f (x10 ,y0 )| ∇f (x0 , y0 ).
Using the now familiar way to compute the directional derivative, we see that


1
∇f (x0 , y0 ) .
Du f (x0 , y0 ) = ∇f (x0 , y0 ) ·
|∇f (x0 , y0 )|

Next, we recall two important facts about the dot product: (i) w · (cv) = c(w · v) for any scalar
c, and (ii) w · w = |w|2 . Applying these properties to the most recent equation involving the
directional derivative, we find that
1
1
Du f (x0 , y0 ) =
(∇f (x0 , y0 ) · ∇f (x0 , y0 )) =
|∇f (x0 , y0 )|2 .
|∇f (x0 , y0 )|
|∇f (x0 , y0 )|
Finally, since ∇f (x0 , y0 ) is a nonzero vector, its length |∇f (x0 , y0 )| is a nonzero scalar, and thus we
can simplify the preceding equation to establish that
Du f (x0 , y0 ) = |∇f (x0 , y0 )|.
We summarize our most recent work by stating two important facts about the gradient.
Let f be a differentiable function and (x0 , y0 ) a point for which ∇f (x0 , y0 ) 6= 0. Then ∇f (x0 , y0 )
points in the direction of greatest increase of f at (x0 , y0 ), and the instantaneous rate of change
of f in that direction is the length of the gradient vector. That is, if u = |∇f (x10 ,y0 )| ∇f (x0 , y0 ),
then u is a unit vector in the direction of greatest increase of f at (x0 , y0 ), and Du f (x0 , y0 ) =
|∇f (x0 , y0 )|.

Applications
The gradient finds many natural applications. For example, situations often arise – for instance,
constructing a road through the mountains or planning the flow of water across a landscape –
where we are interested in knowing the direction in which a function is increasing or decreasing
most rapidly.
For example, consider a two-dimensional version of how a heat-seeking missile might work.5

A heat-seeking missile will always travel in the direction in which the temperature increases
most rapidly; that is, it will always travel in the direction of the gradient ∇T . If a missile is fired
from the point (2, 4), then its path will be that shown on the right in Figure 10.44.
In the final activity of this section, we consider several questions related to this context of a
heat-seeking missile, and foreshadow some upcoming work in Section 10.7.

Summary
• The directional derivative of f at the point (x, y) in the direction of the unit vector u = hu1 , u2 i
is
f (x + u1 h, y + u2 h) − f (x, y)
Du f (x, y) = lim
h→0
h
for those values of x and y for which the limit exists. In addition, Du f (x, y) measures the slope
of the graph of f when we move in the direction u. Alternatively, Du f (x0 , y0 ) measures the
instantaneous rate of change of f in the direction u at (x0 , y0 ).
• The gradient of a function f = f (x, y) at a point (x0 , y0 ) is the vector
∇f (x0 , y0 ) = hfx (x0 , y0 ), fy (x0 , y0 )i .
• The directional derivative in the direction u may be computed by
Du f (x0 , y0 ) = ∇f (x0 , y0 ) · u.
• At any point where the gradient is nonzero, gradient is orthogonal to the contour through that
point and points in the direction in which f increases most rapidly; moreover, the slope of f
in this direction equals the length of the gradient |∇f (x0 , y0 )|. Similarly, the opposite of the
gradient points in the direction of greatest decrease, and that rate of decrease is the opposite of
the length of the gradient.

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• How can we find the points at which f (x, y) has a local maximum or minimum?
• How can we determine whether critical points of f (x, y) are local maxima or minima?
• How can we find the absolute maximum and minimum of f (x, y) on a closed and bounded
domain?

Introduction
We learn in single-variable calculus that the derivative is a useful tool for finding the local maxima
and minima of functions, and that these ideas may often be employed in applied settings. In
particular, if a function f , such as the one shown in Figure 10.48 is everywhere differentiable, we
know that the tangent line is horizontal at any point where f has a local maximum or minimum.
This, of course, means that the derivative f 0 is zero at any such point. Hence, one way that we
seek extreme values of a given function is to first find where the derivative of the function is zero.

In multivariable calculus, we are often similarly interested in finding the greatest and/or least
value(s) that a function may achieve. Moreover, there are many applied settings in which a quantity of interest depends on several different variables. In the following preview activity, we begin
to see how some key ideas in multivariable calculus can help us answer such questions by thinking
about the geometry of the surface generated by a function of two variables.
Preview Activity 10.7. Let z = f (x, y) be a differentiable function, and suppose that at the point
(x0 , y0 ), f achieves a local maximum. That is, the value of f (x0 , y0 ) is greater than the value

160

10.7. OPTIMIZATION

of f (x, y) for all (x, y) nearby (x0 , y0 ). You might find it helpful to sketch a rough picture of a
possible function f that has this property.
(a) If we consider the trace given by holding y = y0 constant, then the single-variable function
defined by f (x, y0 ) must have a local maximum at x0 . What does this say about the value
of the partial derivative fx (x0 , y0 )?
(b) In the same way, the trace given by holding x = x0 constant has a local maximum at y = y0 .
What does this say about the value of the partial derivative fy (x0 , y0 )?
(c) What may we now conclude about the gradient ∇f (x0 , y0 ) at the local maximum? How is
this consistent with the statement “f increases most rapidly in the direction ∇f (x0 , y0 )?”
(d) How will the tangent plane to the surface z = f (x, y) appear at the point (x0 , y0 , f (x0 , y0 ))?
(e) By first computing the partial derivatives, find any points at which f (x, y) = 2x − x2 − (y +
2)2 may have a local maximum.
./

Extrema and Critical Points
One of the important applications of single-variable calculus is the use of derivatives to identify
local extremes of functions (that is, local maxima and local minima). Using the tools we have
developed so far, we can naturally extend the concept of local maxima and minima to severalvariable functions.
Definition 10.5. Let f be a function of two variables x and y.
• The function f has a local maximum at a point (x0 , y0 ) provided that f (x, y) ≤ f (x0 , y0 )
for all points (x, y) near (x0 , y0 ). In this situation we say that f (x0 , y0 ) is a local maximum
value.
• The function f has a local minimum at a point (x0 , y0 ) provided that f (x, y) ≥ f (x0 , y0 )
for all points (x, y) near (x0 , y0 ). In this situation we say that f (x0 , y0 ) is a local minimum
value.
• An absolute maximum point is a point (x0 , y0 ) for which f (x, y) ≤ f (x0 , y0 ) for all points
(x, y) in the domain of f . The value of f at an absolute maximum point is the maximum

We use the term extremum point to refer to any point (x0 , y0 ) at which f has a local maximum
or minimum. In addition, the function value f (x0 , y0 ) at an extremum is called an extremal value.
Figure 10.49 illustrates the graphs of two functions that have an absolute maximum and minimum,
respectively, at the origin (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 0).

Figure 10.49: An absolute maximum and an absolute minimum
In single-variable calculus, we saw that the extrema of a continuous function f always occur
at critical points, values of x where f fails to be differentiable or where f 0 (x) = 0. Said differently,
critical points provide the locations where extrema of a function may appear. Our work in Preview
Activity 10.7 suggests that something similar happens with two-variable functions.
Suppose that a continuous function f has an extremum at (x0 , y0 ). In this case, the trace
f (x, y0 ) has an extremum at x0 , which means that x0 is a critical value of f (x, y0 ). Therefore, either
fx (x0 , y0 ) does not exist or fx (x0 , y0 ) = 0. Similarly, either fy (x0 , y0 ) does not exist or fy (x0 , y0 ) = 0.
This implies that the extrema of a two-variable function occur at points that satisfy the following
definition.
Definition 10.6. A critical point (x0 , y0 ) of a function f = f (x, y) is a point in the domain of
f at which fx (x0 , y0 ) = 0 and fy (x0 , y0 ) = 0, or such that one of fx (x0 , y0 ) or fy (x0 , y0 ) fails to
exist.
We can therefore find critical points of a function f by computing partial derivatives and identifying any values of (x, y) for which one of the partials doesn’t exist or for which both partial
derivatives are simultaneously zero. For the latter, note that we have to solve the system of equations
fx (x, y) = 0
fy (x, y) = 0.

Classifying Critical Points: The Second Derivative Test
While the extrema of a continuous function f always occur at critical points, it is important to
note that not every critical point leads to an extremum. Recall, for instance, f (x) = x3 from single
variable calculus. We know that x0 = 0 is a critical point since f 0 (x0 ) = 0, but x0 = 0 is neither a
local maximum nor a local minimum of f .
A similar situation may arise in a multivariable setting. Consider the function f defined by
f (x, y) = x2 − y 2 whose graph and contour plot are shown in Figure 10.50. Because ∇f =
h2x, −2yi, we see that the origin (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 0) is a critical point. However, this critical point
is neither a local maximum or minimum; the origin is a local minimum on the trace defined by
y = 0, while the origin is a local maximum on the trace defined by x = 0. We call such a critical
point a saddle point due to the shape of the graph near the critical point.

As in single-variable calculus, we would like to have some sort of test to help us identify
whether a critical point is a local maximum, local maximum, or neither. Before describing the test
that accomplishes this classification in a two-variable setting, we recall the Second Derivative Test
from single-variable calculus.
The Second Derivative Test for single-variable functions. If x0 is a critical point of a function
f so that f 0 (x0 ) = 0 and if f 00 (x0 ) exists, then
• if f 00 (x0 ) < 0, x0 is a local maximum,
• if f 00 (x0 ) > 0, x0 is a local minimum, and
• if f 00 (x0 ) = 0, this test yields no information.
For the analogous test for functions of two variables, we have to consider all of the secondorder partial derivatives.
The Second Derivative Test for two-variable functions. Suppose (x0 , y0 ) is a critical point of
the function f for which fx (x0 , y0 ) = 0 and fy (x0 , y0 ) = 0. Let D be the quantity defined by
D = fxx (x0 , y0 )fyy (x0 , y0 ) − fxy (x0 , y0 )2 .
• If D > 0 and fxx (x0 , y0 ) < 0, then f has a local maximum at (x0 , y0 ).
• If D > 0 and fxx (x0 , y0 ) > 0, then f has a local minimum at (x0 , y0 ).
• If D < 0, then f has a saddle point at (x0 , y0 ).
• If D = 0, then this test yields no information about what happens at (x0 , y0 ).
The quantity D is called the discriminant of the function f at (x0 , y0 ).
To properly understand the origin of the Second Derivative Test, we could introduce a “secondorder directional derivative.” If this second-order directional derivative were negative in every
direction, for instance, we could guarantee that the critical point is a local maximum. A complete
justification of the Second Derivative Test requires key ideas from linear algebra that are beyond
the scope of this course, so instead of presenting a detailed explanation, we will accept this test as
stated and demonstrate its use in three basic examples.

10.7. OPTIMIZATION

Example 10.1. Let f (x, y) = 4 − x2 − y 2 as shown in
Figure 10.51. Critical points occur when fx = −2x = 0
and fy = −2y = 0 so the origin (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 0) is the
only critical point. We then find that
fxx (0, 0) = −2, fyy (0, 0) = −2, and fxy (0, 0) = 0,
giving D = (−2)(−2) − 02 = 4 > 0. We then consider fxx (0, 0) = −2 < 0 and conclude, from the Second Derivative Test, that f (0, 0) = 4 is a local maximum
value.
Example 10.2. Let f (x, y) = x2 + y 2 as shown in Figure
10.52. Critical points occur when fx = 2x = 0 and fy =
2y = 0 so the origin (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 0) is the only critical
point. We then find that

Figure 10.51: z = 4 − x2 − y 2

fxx (0, 0) = 2, fyy (0, 0) = 2, and fxy (0, 0) = 0,
giving D = 2 · 2 − 02 = 4 > 0. We then consider
fxx (0, 0) = 2 > 0 and conclude, from the Second Derivative Test, that f (0, 0) = 0 is a local minimum value.

Example 10.3. Let f (x, y) = x2 − y 2 as shown in Figure
10.53. Critical points occur when fx = 2x = 0 and fy =
−2y = 0 so the origin (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 0) is the only critical
point. We then find that
fxx (0, 0) = 2, fyy (0, 0) = −2, and fxy (0, 0) = 0,
giving D = 2 · (−2) − 02 = −4 < 0. We then conclude,
from the Second Derivative Test, that (0, 0) is a saddle
point.

As we learned in single-variable calculus, finding extremal values of functions can be particularly useful in applied settings. For instance, we can often use calculus to determine the least

expensive way to construct something or to find the most efficient route between two locations.
The same possibility holds in settings with two or more variables.

Activity 10.23.
While the quantity of a product demanded by consumers is often a function of the price of
the product, the demand for a product may also depend on the price of other products. For
instance, the demand for blue jeans at Old Navy may be affected not only by the price of the
jeans themselves, but also by the price of khakis.
Suppose we have two goods whose respective prices are p1 and p2 . The demand for these
goods, q1 and q2 , depend on the prices as
q1 = 150 − 2p1 − p2

q2 = 200 − p1 − 3p2 .

(10.14)
(10.15)

The seller would like to set the prices p1 and p2 in order to maximize revenue. We will assume
that the seller meets the full demand for each product. Thus, if we let R be the revenue obtained
by selling q1 items of the first good at price p1 per item and q2 items of the second good at price
p2 per item, we have
R = p 1 q1 + p 2 q2 .
We can then write the revenue as a function of just the two variables p1 and p2 by using Equations (10.14) and (10.15), giving us
R(p1 , p2 ) = p1 (150 − 2p1 − p2 ) + p2 (200 − p1 − 3p2 ) = 150p1 + 200p2 − 2p1 p2 − 2p21 − 3p22 .
A graph of R as a function of p1 and p2 is shown in Figure 10.54.

Optimization on a Restricted Domain
The Second Derivative Test helps us classify critical points of a function, but it does not tell us
if the function actually has an absolute maximum or minimum at each such point. For singlevariable functions, the Extreme Value Theorem told us that a continuous function on a closed
interval [a, b] always has both an absolute maximum and minimum on that interval, and that these
absolute extremes must occur at either an endpoint or at a critical point. Thus, to find the absolute
maximum and minimum, we determine the critical points in the interval and then evaluate the
function at these critical point s and at the endpoints of the interval. A similar approach works for
functions of two variables.
For functions of two variables, closed and bounded regions play the role that closed intervals
did for functions of a single variable. A closed region is a region that contains its boundary (the
unit disk x2 + y 2 ≤ 1 is closed, while its interior x2 + y 2 < 1 is not, for example), while a bounded
region is one that does not stretch to infinity in any direction. Just as for functions of a single
variable, continuous functions of several variables that are defined on closed, bounded regions
must have absolute maxima and minima in those regions.
The Extreme Value Theorem. Let f = f (x, y) be a continuous function on a closed and
bounded region R. Then f has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum in R.
The absolute extremes must occur at either a critical point in the interior of R or at a boundary
point of R. We therefore must test both possibilities, as we demonstrate in the following example.
Example 10.4. Suppose the temperature T at each point on the circular plate x2 + y 2 ≤ 1 is given
by
T (x, y) = 2x2 + y 2 − y.

The domain R = {(x, y) : x2 + y 2 ≤ 1} is a closed and bounded region, as shown on the left
of Figure 10.55, so the Extreme Value Theorem assures us that T has an absolute maximum and
minimum on the plate. The graph of T over its domain R is shown in Figure 10.55. We will find
the hottest and coldest points on the plate.
If the absolute maximum or minimum occurs inside the disk, it will be at a critical point so we
begin by looking for critical points inside the disk. To do this, notice that critical points are given
by the conditions Tx = 4x = 0 and Ty = 2y − 1 = 0. This means that there is one critical point of
the function at the point (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 1/2), which lies inside the disk.
We now find the hottest and coldest points on the boundary of the disk, which is the circle of
radius 1. As we have seen, the points on the unit circle can be parametrized as
x(t) = cos(t), y(t) = sin(t),

where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. The temperature at a point on the circle is then described by
T (x(t), y(t)) = 2 cos2 (t) + sin2 (t) − sin(t).
To find the hottest and coldest point on the boundary, we look for the critical points of this
single-variable function on the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. We have
dT
= −4 cos(t) sin(t) + 2 cos(t) sin(t) − cos(t) = −2 cos(t) sin(t) − cos(t) = cos(t)(−2 sin(t) − 1) = 0.
dt
This shows that we have critical points when cos(t) = 0 or sin(t) = −1/2. This occurs when
t = π/2, 3π/2, 7π/6, and 11π/6. Since we have x(t) = cos(t) and y(t) = sin(t), the corresponding
points are
• (x, y) = (0, 1) when t = π2 ,
• (x, y) = (0, −1) when t =

• (x, y) = 23 , − 12 when t = 11π
6 .

These are the critical points of T on the boundary and so this collection of points includes the
hottest and coldest points on the boundary.
We now have a list of candidates for the hottest and coldest points: the critical point in the
interior of the disk and the critical points on the boundary. We find the hottest and coldest points
by evaluating the temperature at each of these points, and find that

• T 0, 12 = −14 ,

• T 23 , − 12 = 94 .

• T (0, −1) = 2,

So the maximum value of T on the disk x2 + y 2 ≤ 1 is 94 , which occurs at the two points
 √
± 23 , − 12 on the boundary, and the minimum value of T on the disk is − 41 which occurs at the

critical point 0, 21 in the interior of R.
From this example, we see that we use the following procedure for determining the absolute
maximum and absolute minimum of a function on a closed and bounded domain.
Step 1: Find all critical points of the function in the interior of the domain.
Step 2: Find all the critical points of the function on the boundary of the domain. Working on
the boundary of the domain reduces this part of the problem to one or more single variable
optimization problems.
Step 3: Evaluate the function at each of the points found in Steps 1 and 2.
Step 4: The maximum value of the function is the largest value obtained in Step 3, and the minimum value of the function is the smallest value obtained in Step 3.

Summary
• To find the extrema of a function f = f (x, y), we first find the critical points, which are points
where one of the partials of f fails to exist, or where fx = 0 and fy = 0.
• The Second Derivative Test helps determine whether a critical point is a local maximum, local
minimum, or saddle point.
• If f is defined on a closed and bounded domain, we find the absolute maxima and minima
by finding the critical points in the interior of the domain, finding the critical points on the
boundary, and testing the value of f at both sets of critical points.

Consider the function f defined by f (x, y) = 4x2 ey − 2x4 − e4y .8 Show that f has exactly two
critical points of f , and that f has relative maximum values at each of these critical points.
Explain how function illustrates that it really is possible to have two mountains without some

graphically how this happens.
3. If a continuous function f of a single variable has exactly one critical number with a relative

Let f (x, y) = 3xey − x3 − e3y9 Show that f has exactly one critical point, has a relative maximum value at that critical point, but that f has no absolute maximum value. Use appropriate
technology to draw the surface defined by f to see graphically how this happens.
4. A manufacturer wants to procure rectangular boxes to ship its product. The boxes must contain
20 cubic feet of space. To be durable enough to ensure the safety of the product, the material for
the sides of the boxes will cost $0.10 per square foot, while the material for the top and bottom
will cost $0.25 per square foot. In this activity we will help the manufacturer determine the box
of minimal cost.
(a) What quantities are constant in this problem? What are the variables in this problem?
Provide appropriate variable labels. What, if any, restrictions are there on the variables?
(b) Using your variables from (a), determine a formula for the total cost C of a box.
(c) Your formula in part (b) might be in terms of three variables. If so, find a relationship

(d) Find the dimensions that minimize the cost of a box. Be sure to verify that you have a
minimum cost.
5. A rectangular box with length x, width y, and height z is being built. The box is positioned
so that one corner is stationed at the origin and the box lies in the first octant where x, y,
and z are all positive. There is an added constraint on how the box is constructed: it must fit
underneath the plane with equation x + 2y + 3z = 6. In fact, we will assume that the corner of
the box “opposite” the origin must actually lie on this plane. The basic problem is to find the
maximum volume of the box.
(a) Sketch the plane x+2y +3z = 6, as well as a picture of a potential box. Label everything
appropriately.
(b) Explain how you can use the fact that one corner of the box lies on the plane to write

Let x, y, and z be the length, width, and height (in inches) of a carry on bag. In this problem we

Assume that we use all 45 inches to get a maximum volume. (Note that this bag of maximum

carry-on bags sold today measure 22 by 14 by 9 inches with a volume of 2772 cubic
inches, so that the bags will fit into the overhead bins.)
7. According to The Song of Insects by G.W. Pierce (Harvard College Press, 1948) the sound of
striped ground crickets chirping, in number of chirps per second, is related to the temperature.
So the number of chirps per second could be a predictor of temperature. The data Pierce collected is shown in the table below, where x is the (average) number of chirps per second and y
is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

A scatter plot of the data is given below. The relationship between x and y is not exactly
linear, but looks to have a linear pattern. It could be that the relationship is really linear but
experimental error causes the data to be slightly inaccurate. Or perhaps the data is not linear,
but only approximately linear.
If we want to use the data to make predications, then we need to fit a curve of some kind to
the data. Since the cricket data appears roughly linear, we will fit a linear function f of the
form f (x) = mx + b to the data. We will do this in such a way that we minimize the sums of
the squares of the distances between the y values of the data and the corresponding y values
of the line defined by f . This type of fit is called a least squares approximation. If the data is
represented by the points (x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ), . . ., (xn , yn ), then the square of the distance between
yi and f (xi ) is (f (xi ) − yi )2 = (mxi + b − yi )2 . So our goal is to minimize the sum of these

Constrained Optimization:Lagrange Multipliers

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What geometric condition enables us to optimize a function f = f (x, y) subject to a constraint given by g(x, y) = k, where k is a constant?
• How can we exploit this geometric condition to find the extreme values of a function subject
to a constraint?

Introduction
We previously considered how to find the extreme values of functions on both unrestricted domains and on closed, bounded domains. Other types of optimization problems involve maximizing or minimizing a quantity subject to an external constraint. In these cases the extreme values
frequently won’t occur at the points where the gradient is zero, but rather at other points that
satisfy an important geometric condition. These problems are often called constrained optimization
problems and can be solved with the method of Lagrange Multipliers, which we study in this
section.
Preview Activity 10.8. According to U.S. postal regulations, the girth plus the length of a parcel
sent by mail may not exceed 108 inches, where by “girth” we mean the perimeter of the smallest
end. Our goal is to find the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that
can be sent by mail.10 If we let x be the length of the side of one square end of the package and y
the length of the package, then we want to maximize the volume f (x, y) = x2 y of the box subject
to the constraint that the girth (4x) plus the length (y) is as large as possible, or 4x + y = 108. The
equation 4x + y = 108 is thus an external constraint on the variables.
(a) The constraint equation involves the function g that is given by
g(x, y) = 4x + y.
Explain why the constraint is a contour of g, and is therefore a two-dimensional curve.
(b) Figure 10.57 shows the graph of the constraint equation g(x, y) = 108 along with a few
contours of the volume function f . Since our goal is to find the maximum value of f
subject to the constraint g(x, y) = 108, we want to find the point on our constraint curve
that intersects the contours of f at which f has its largest value.
10
We solved this applied optimization problem in single variable Active Calculus, so it may look familiar. We take
a different approach in this section, and this approach allows us to view most applied optimization problems from
single variable calculus as constrained optimization problems, as well as provide us tools to solve a greater variety of
optimization problems.

Constrained Optimization and Lagrange Multipliers
In Preview Activity 10.8, we considered an optimization problem where there is an external constraint on the variables, namely that the girth plus the length of the package cannot exceed 108
inches. We saw that we can create a function g from the constraint, specifically g(x, y) = 4x + y.
The constraint equation is then just a contour of g, g(x, y) = c, where c is a constant (in our case
108). Figure 10.58 illustrates that the volume function f is maximized, subject to the constraint
g(x, y) = c, when the graph of g(x, y) = c is tangent to a contour of f . Moreover, the value of f on
this contour is the sought maximum value. To find this point where the graph of the constraint is
tangent to a contour of f , recall that ∇f is perpendicular to the contours of f and ∇g is perpendicular to the contour of g. At such a point, the vectors ∇g and ∇f are parallel, and thus we need

to determine the points where this occurs. Recall that two vectors are parallel if one is a nonzero
scalar multiple of the other, so we therefore look for values of a parameter λ that make
∇f = λ∇g.

(10.16)

The constant λ is called a Lagrange multiplier.
To find the values of λ that satisfy (10.16) for the volume function in Preview Activity 10.8, we
calculate both ∇f and ∇g. Observe that
∇f = 2xyi + x2 j

and

∇g = 4i + j,

and thus we need a value of λ so that
2xyi + x2 j = λ(4i + j).
Equating components in the most recent equation and incorporating the original constraint, we
have three equations
2xy = λ(4)
2

x = λ(1)
4x + y = 108

(10.17)
(10.18)
(10.19)

in the three unknowns x, y, and λ. First, note that if λ = 0, then equation (10.18) shows that
x = 0. From this, Equation (10.19) tells us that y = 108. So the point (0, 108) is a point we need
to consider. Next, provided that λ 6= 0 (from which it follows that x 6= 0 by Equation (10.18)), we
may divide both sides of Equation (10.17) by the corresponding sides of (10.18) to eliminate λ, and
thus find that
2y
= 4, so
x
y = 2x.

178

10.8. CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION:LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS

Substituting into Equation (10.19) gives us
4x + 2x = 108
or
x = 18.
Thus we have y = 2x = 36 and λ = x2 = 324 as another point to consider. So the points at which
the gradients of f and g are parallel, and thus at which f may have a maximum or minimum
subject to the constraint, are (0, 108) and (18, 36). By evaluating the function f at these points, we
see that we maximize the volume when the length of the square end of the box is 18 inches and the
length is 36 inches, for a maximum volume of f (18, 36) = 11664 cubic inches. Since f (0, 108) = 0,
we obtain a minimum value at this point.
We summarize the process of Lagrange multipliers as follows.
The general technique for optimizing a function f = f (x, y) subject to a constraint g(x, y) = c
is to solve the system ∇f = λ∇g for x, y, and λ. We then evaluate the function f at each point
(x, y) that results from a solution to the system in order to find the optimum values of f subject
to the constraint.

Summary
• The extrema of a function f = f (x, y) subject to a constraint g(x, y) = c occur at points for
which the contour of f is tangent to the curve that represents the constraint equation. This
occurs when
∇f = λ∇g.
• We use the condition ∇f = λ∇g to generate a system of equations, together with the constraint
g(x, y) = c, that may be solved for x, y, and λ. Once we have all the solutions, we evaluate f at
each of the (x, y) points to determine the extrema.

Exercises
1. The Cobb-Douglas production function is used in economics to model production levels based
on labor and equipment. Suppose we have a specific Cobb-Douglas function of the form
f (x, y) = 50x0.4 y 0.6 ,
where x is the dollar amount spent on labor and y the dollar amount spent on equipment. Use
the method of Lagrange multipliers to determine how much should be spent on labor and how
much on equipment to maximize productivity if we have a total of $1.5 million dollars to invest
in labor and equipment.
2. Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the point on the line x − 2y = 5 that is closest
to the point (1, 3). To do so, respond to the following prompts.
(a) Write the function f = f (x, y) that measures the square of the distance from (x, y) to
(1, 3). (The extrema of this function are the same as the extrema of the distance function,
but f (x, y) is simpler to work with.)
(b) What is the constraint g(x, y) = c?
(c) Write the equations resulting from ∇f = λ∇g and the constraint. Find all the points
(x, y) satisfying these equations.
(d) Test all the points you found to determine the extrema.
3. Apply the Method of Lagrange Multipliers solve each of the following constrained optimization problems.
(a) Determine the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of f (x, y) = (x − 1)2 +
(y − 2)2 subject to the constraint that x2 + y 2 = 16.
(b) Determine the points on the sphere x2 + y 2 + z 2 = 4 that are closest to and farthest from
the point (3, 1, −1). (As in the preceding exercise, you may find it simpler to work with
the square of the distance formula, rather than the distance formula itself.)

180

10.8. CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION:LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS
(c) Find the absolute maximum and minimum of f (x, y, z) = x2 + y 2 + z 2 subject to the
constraint that (x − 3)2 + (y + 2)2 + (z − 5)2 ≤ 16. (Hint: here the constraint is a closed,
bounded region. Use the boundary of that region for applying Lagrange Multipliers,
but don’t forget to also test any critical values of the function that lie in the interior of
the region.)

4. There is a useful interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier λ. Assume that we want to optimize
a function f with constraint g(x, y) = c. Recall that an optimal solution occurs at a point (x0 , y0 )
where ∇f = λ∇g. As the constraint changes, so does the point at which the optimal solution
occurs. So we can think of the optimal point as a function of the parameter c, that is x0 = x0 (c)
and y0 = y0 (c). The optimal value of f subject to the constraint can then be considered as a
function of c defined by f (x0 (c), y0 (c)). The Chain Rule shows that

Conclude that λ tells us the rate of change of the function f as the parameter c increases
(or by approximately how much the optimal value of the function f will change if we
increase the value of c by 1 unit).

Double Riemann Sums and Double Integrals over Rectangles

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What is a double Riemann sum?
• How is the double integral of a continuous function f = f (x, y) defined?
• What are two things the double integral of a function can tell us?

Introduction
In single-variable calculus, recall that we approximated the area under the graph of a positive
function f on an interval [a, b] by adding areas of rectangles whose heights are determined by
the curve. The general process involved subdividing the interval [a, b] into smaller subintervals,
constructing rectangles on each of these smaller intervals to approximate the region under the
curve on that subinterval, then summing the areas of these rectangles to approximate the area
under the curve. We will extend this process in this section to its three-dimensional analogs,
double Riemann sums and double integrals over rectangles.

the idea of the single-variable definite integral to functions of two variables over rectangular domains. To do so, we will need to understand how to partition a rectangle into
subrectangles. Let R be rectangular domain R = {(x, y) : 0 ≤ x ≤ 6, 2 ≤ y ≤ 4} (we can
also represent this domain with the notation [0, 6] × [2, 4]), as pictured in Figure 11.1.

To form a partition of the full rectangular region, R, we will partition both intervals [0, 6]
and [2, 4]; in particular, we choose to partition the interval [0, 6] into three uniformly sized
subintervals and the interval [2, 4] into two evenly sized subintervals as shown in Figure
11.1. In the following questions, we discuss how to identify the endpoints of each subinterval and the resulting subrectangles.
i. Let 0 = x0 < x1 < x2 < x3 = 6 be the endpoints of the subintervals of [0, 6] after
partitioning. What is the length ∆x of each subinterval [xi−1 , xi ] for i from 1 to 3?
ii. Explicitly identify x0 , x1 , x2 , and x3 . On Figure 11.1 or your own version of the
diagram, label these endpoints.
iii. Let 2 = y0 < y1 < y2 = 4 be the endpoints of the subintervals of [2, 4] after partitioning. What is the length ∆y of each subinterval [yj−1 , yj ] for j from 1 to 2? Identify y0 ,
y1 , and y2 and label these endpoints on Figure 11.1.
iv. Let Rij denote the subrectangle [xi−1 , xi ] × [yj−1 , yj ]. Appropriately label each subrectangle in your drawing of Figure 11.1. How does the total number of subrectangles
depend on the partitions of the intervals [0, 6] and [2, 4]?
v. What is area ∆A of each subrectangle?

Double Riemann Sums over Rectangles
For the definite integral in single-variable calculus, we considered a continuous function over a
closed, bounded interval [a, b]. In multivariable calculus, we will eventually develop the idea of a
definite integral over a closed, bounded region (such as the interior of a circle). We begin with a

simpler situation by thinking only about rectangular domains, and will address more complicated
domains in the following section.
Let f = f (x, y) be a continuous function defined on a rectangular domain R = {(x, y) : a ≤
x ≤ b, c ≤ y ≤ d}. As we saw in Preview Activity 11.1, the domain is a rectangle R and we want to
partition R into subrectangles. We do this by partitioning each of the intervals [a, b] and [c, d] into
subintervals and using those subintervals to create a partition of R into subrectangles. In the first
activity, we address the quantities and notations we will use in order to define double Riemann
sums and double integrals.

sized subintervals as shown in Figure 11.2. As we did in Preview Activity 11.1, we will need a

Double Riemann Sums and Double Integrals
Now we use the process from the most recent activity to formally define double Riemann sums
and double integrals.
Definition 11.1. Let f be a continuous function on a rectangle R = {(x, y) : a ≤ x ≤ b, c ≤ y ≤
d}. A double Riemann sum for f over R is created as follows.

m . Let x0 , x1 , . . .,
xm be the endpoints of these subintervals, where a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xm = b.

n . Let y0 , y1 , . . .,
yn be the endpoints of these subintervals, where c = y0 < y1 < y2 < · · · < yn = d.
• These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle R into mn subrectangles Rij with
opposite vertices (xi−1 , yj−1 ) and (xi , yj ) for i between 1 and m and j between 1 and n.
These rectangles all have equal area ∆A = ∆x · ∆y.

the rectangular boxes approaches the volume of the solid bounded above by f over R. The value
of this limit, provided it exists, is the double integral.

Summary
• Let f be a continuous function on a rectangle R = {(x, y) : a ≤ x ≤ b, c ≤ y ≤ d}. The double
Riemann sum for f over R is created as follows.
- Partition the interval [a, b] into m subintervals of equal length ∆x = b−a
m . Let x0 , x1 , . . .,
xm be the endpoints of these subintervals, where a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xm = b.

- Partition the interval [c, d] into n subintervals of equal length ∆y = d−c
n . Let y0 , y1 , . . ., yn
be the endpoints of these subintervals, where c = y0 < y1 < y2 < · · · < yn = d.

- These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle R into mn subrectangles Rij with
opposite vertices (xi−1 , yj−1 ) and (xi , yj ) for i between 1 and m and j between 1 and n.
These rectangles all have equal area ∆A = ∆x · ∆y.

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• How do we evaluate a double integral over a rectangle as an iterated integral, and why
does this process work?

where the different variables and notation are as described in Section 11.1. Thus R f (x, y) dA is
a limit of double Riemann sums, but while this definition tells us exactly what a double integral
is, it is not very helpful for determining the value of a double integral. Fortunately, there is a way
to view a double integral as an iterated integral, which will make computations feasible in many
cases.
The viewpoint of an iterated integral is closely connected to an important idea from singlevariable calculus. When we studied solids of revolution, such as the one shown in Figure 11.7, we
saw that in some circumstances we could slice the solid perpendicular to an axis and have each
slice be approximately a circular disk. From there, we were able to find the volume of each disk,
and then use an integral to add the volumes of the slices. In what follows, we are able to use single
integrals to generalize this approach to handle even more general geometric shapes.

As with partial derivatives, we may treat one of the variables in f as constant and think of
the resulting function as a function of a single variable. Now we investigate what happens if we
integrate instead of differentiate.

an iterated integral. Let f be a continuous function on a rectangular domain R = [a, b] × [c, d], and
let

The function A = A(x) determines the value of the cross sectional area1 in the y direction for the

Figure 11.10: Summing cross section slices.
The value of this cross sectional area is determined by the input x in A. Since A is a function of
x, it follows that we can integrate A with respect to x. In doing so, we use a partition of [a, b] and
make an approximation to the integral given by

∆x as illustrated in Figure 11.9. We add the signed volumes of these slices as shown in the frames
in Figure 11.10 to obtain an approximation of the total signed volume.
As we let the number of subintervals in the x direction approach infinity, we can see that

It is natural to wonder how we might define and evaluate a double integral over a nonrectangular region; we explore one such example in the following preview activity.
Preview Activity 11.3. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional figure with four faces, each of which
is a triangle. A picture of the tetrahedron T with vertices (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1) is
shown in Figure 11.11. If we place one vertex at the origin and let vectors a, b, and c be determined
by the edges of the tetrahedron that have one end at the origin, then a formula that tells us the
volume V of the tetrahedron is

V = |a · (b × c)|.

(a) Use the formula (11.1) to find the volume of the tetrahedron T .
(b) Instead of memorizing or looking up the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron, we can
use a double integral to calculate the volume of the tetrahedron T . To see how, notice that
the top face of the tetrahedron T is the plane whose equation is
z = 1 − (x + y).

the tetrahedron will be given by an iterated integral of the form

The issue that is new here is how we find the limits on the integrals; note that the outer
integral’s limits are in x, while the inner ones are in y, since we have chosen dA = dy dx.
To see the domain over which we need to integrate, think of standing way above the tetrahedron looking straight down on it, which means we are projecting the entire tetrahedron
onto the xy-plane. The resulting domain is the triangular region shown in Figure 11.12.
Explain why we can represent the triangular region with the inequalities
0≤y ≤1−x

and 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.

(c) Explain why it makes sense to now write the volume integral in the form

11.3. DOUBLE INTEGRALS OVER GENERAL REGIONS

Double Integrals over General Regions
So far, we have learned that a double integral over a rectangular region may be interpreted in one
of two ways:
•

ZZ
f (x, y) dA tells us the volume of the solids the graph of f bounds above the xy-plane
R

over the rectangle R minus the volume of the solids the graph of f bounds below the xyplane under the rectangle R;
•

ZZ
1
f (x, y) dA, where A(R) is the area of R tells us the average value of the function f
A(R) R
on R. If f (x, y) ≥ 0 on R, we can interpret this average value of f on R as the height of the
box with base R that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by f over R.

As we saw in Preview Activity 11.1, a function f = f (x, y) may be considered over regions
other than rectangular ones, and thus we want to understand how to set up and evaluate double
integrals over non-rectangular regions. Note that if we can, then the two interpretations of the
double integral noted above will naturally extend to solid regions with non-rectangular bases.
So, suppose f is a continuous function on a closed, bounded domain D. For example, consider
D as the circular domain shown in Figure 11.13. We can enclose D in a rectangular domain R as

shown in Figure 11.14 and extend the function f to be defined over R in order to be able to use
the definition of the double integral over a rectangle. We extend f in such a way that its values at
the points in R that are not in D contribute 0 to the value of the integral. In other words, define a

11.3. DOUBLE INTEGRALS OVER GENERAL REGIONS

201

function F = F (x, y) on R as
(
f (x, y),
F (x, y) =
0,

if (x, y) ∈ D,
.
if (x, y) 6∈ D

We then say that the double integral of f over D is the same as the double integral of F over R,
and thus
ZZ
ZZ
f (x, y) dA =
F (x, y) dA.
D

R

In practice, we just ignore everything that is in R but not in D, since these regions contribute 0 to
the value of the integral.
Just as with double integrals over rectangles, a double integral over a domain D can be evaluated as an iterated integral. If the region D can be described by the inequalities g1 (x) ≤ y ≤ g2 (x)
and a ≤ x ≤ b, where g1 = g1 (x) and g2 = g2 (x) are functions of only x, then
ZZ
Z x=b Z y=g2 (x)
f (x, y) dA =
f (x, y) dy dx.
D

x=a

y=g1 (x)

Alternatively, if the region D is described by the inequalities h1 (y) ≤ x ≤ h2 (y) and c ≤ y ≤ d,
where h1 = h1 (y) and h2 = h2 (y) are functions of only y, we have
ZZ
Z y=d Z x=h2 (y)
f (x, y) dA =
f (x, y) dx dy.
D

y=c

x=h1 (y)

The structure of an iterated integral is of particular note:
In an iterated double integral:
• the limits on the outer integral must be constants;
• the limits on the inner integral must be constants or in terms of only the remaining variable – that is, if the inner integral is with respect to y, then its limits may only involve x
and constants, and vice versa.

We next consider a detailed example.
Example 11.1. Let f (x, y) = x2 y be defined
on the triangle D with vertices (0, 0), (2, 0), and (2, 3)
ZZ
f (x, y) dA, we must first describe the region D in terms

as shown in Figure 11.15. To evaluate
D

of the variables x and y. We take two approaches.
Approach 1: Integrate first with respect to y. In this case we choose to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral in the form

will look like. Several slices of the domain are shown in Figure 11.16. On a slice with fixed x
value, the y values are bounded below by 0 and above by the y coordinate on the hypotenuse
of the right triangle. Thus, g1 (x) = 0; to find y = g2 (x), we need to write the hypotenuse as
a function of x. The hypotenuse connects the points (0,0) and (2,3) and hence has equation
y = 23 x. This gives the upper bound on y as g2 (x) = 32 x. The leftmost vertical cross section is
at x = 0 and the rightmost one is at x = 2, so we have a = 0 and b = 2. Therefore,

hypotenuse of the right triangle and above by 2. So h2 (y) = 2; to find h1 (y), we need to write
the hypotenuse as a function of y. Solving the earlier equation we have for the hypotenuse
(y = 32 x) for x gives us x = 32 y. This makes h1 (y) = 32 y. The lowest horizontal cross section

We see, of course, that in the situation where D can be described in two different ways, the order
in which we choose to set up and evaluate the double integral doesn’t matter, and the same value
results in either case.
The meaning of a double integral over a non-rectangular region, D, parallels the meaning over
a rectangular region. In particular,

on the inner integral must be constants or in terms of only the remaining variable. In other
words, an iterated double integral has one of the following forms (which result in the same

Applications of Double Integrals

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• If we have a mass density function for a lamina (thin plate), how does a double integral
determine the mass of the lamina?
• How may a double integral be used to find the area between two curves?
• Given a mass density function on a lamina, how can we find the lamina’s center of mass?
• What is a joint probability density function? How do we determine the probability of an
event if we know a probability density function?

Introduction
So far, we have
RR interpreted the double integral of a function f over a domain D in two different
ways. First, D f (x, y) dA tells us a difference of volumes – the volume the surface defined by

investigate several other applications of double integrals, using the integration process as seen in
Preview Activity 11.4: we partition into small regions, approximate the desired quantity on each
small region, then use the integral to sum these values exactly in the limit.
The following preview activity explores how a double integral can be used to determine the
density of a thin plate with a mass density distribution. Recall that in single-variable calculus,
we considered a similar problem and computed the mass of a one-dimensional rod with a massdensity distribution. There, as here, the key idea is that if density is constant, mass is the product
of density and volume.
Preview Activity 11.4. Suppose that we have a flat, thin object (called a lamina) whose density
varies across the object. We can think of the density on a lamina as a measure of mass per unit
area. As an example, consider a circular plate D of radius 1 cm centered at the origin whose
density δ varies depending on the distance from its center so that the density in grams per square
centimeter at point (x, y) is
δ(x, y) = 10 − 2(x2 + y 2 ).

Mass
Density is a measure of some quantity per unit area or volume. For example, we can measure the
human population density of some region as the number of humans in that region divided by the
area of that region. In physics, the mass density of an object is the mass of the object per unit area
or volume. As suggested by Preview Activity 11.4, the following holds in general.
If δ(x, y) describes the density

11.4. APPLICATIONS OF DOUBLE INTEGRALS

Area
If we consider the situation where the mass-density distribution is constant, we can also see how
a double integral may be used to determine the area of a region. Assuming that δ(x, y) =RR
1 over a
closed bounded region D, where the units of δ are “mass per unit of area,” it follows that D 1 dA
is the mass of the lamina. But since the density is constant, the numerical value of the integral is
simply the area.
As the following activity demonstrates, we can also see this fact by considering a three-dimensional
solid whose height is always 1.

Activity 11.10.
Suppose we want to find the area of the bounded region D between the curves
y = 1 − x2

and

y = x − 1.

A picture of this region is shown in Figure 11.19.
(a) We know that the volume of a solid with constant height is given by the area of the base
times the height. Hence, we may interpret the area of the region D as the volume of a
solid with base D and of uniform height 1. Determine a double integral whose value is
the area of D.

We now formally state the conclusion from our earlier discussion and Activity 11.10.
Given a closed, bounded region D in the plane, the area of D, denoted A(D), is given by the
double integral
ZZ
1 dA.

A(D) =

Center of Mass
The center of mass of an object is a point at which the object will balance perfectly. For example,
the center of mass of a circular disk of uniform density is located at its center. For any object, if
we throw it through the air, it will spin around its center of mass and behave as if all the mass is
located at the center of mass.
In order to understand the role that integrals play in determining the center of a mass of an
object with a nonuniform mass distribution, we start by finding the center of mass of a collection
of N distinct point-masses in the plane.
Let m1 , m2 , . . ., mN be N masses located in the plane. Think of these masses as connected by
rigid rods of negligible weight from some central point (x, y). A picture with four masses is shown
in Figure 11.20. Now imagine balancing this system by placing it on a thin pole at the point (x, y)
perpendicular to the plane containing the masses. Unless the masses are perfectly balanced, the
system will fall off the pole. The point (x, y) at which the system will balance perfectly is called
the center of mass of the system. Our goal is to determine the center of mass of a system of discrete
masses, then extend this to a continuous lamina.

Figure 11.20: A center of mass (x, y) of four masses.
Each mass exerts a force (called a moment) around the lines x = x and y = y that causes
the system to tilt in the direction of the mass. These moments are dependent on the mass and
the distance from the given line. Let (x1 , y1 ) be the location of mass m1 , (x2 , y2 ) the location of
mass m2 , etc. In order to balance perfectly, the moments in the x direction and in the y direction

212

11.4. APPLICATIONS OF DOUBLE INTEGRALS

must be in equilibrium. We determine these moments and solve the resulting system to find the
equilibrium point (x, y) at the center of mass.
The force that mass m1 exerts to tilt the system from the line y = y is
m1 g(y − y1 ),
where g is the gravitational constant. Similarly, the force mass m2 exerts to tilt the system from the
line y = y is
m2 g(y − y2 ).
In general, the force that mass mk exerts to tilt the system from the line y = y is
mk g(y − yk ).
For the system to balance, we need the forces to sum to 0, so that

If we take the limit as m and n go to infinity, we obtain the exact center of mass (x, y) of the

Probability
Calculating probabilities is a very important application of integration in the physical, social, and
life sciences. To understand the basics, consider the game of darts in which a player throws a dart
at a board and tries to hit a particular target. Let us suppose that a dart board is in the form of
a disk D with radius 10 inches. If we assume that a player throws a dart at random, and is not
aiming at any particular point, then it is equally probable that the dart will strike any single point
on the board. For instance, the probability that the dart will strike a particular 1 square inch region
1
is 100π
, or the ratio of the area of the desired target to the total area of D (assuming that the dart
thrower always hits the board itself at some point). Similarly, the probability that the dart strikes
a point in the disk D3 of radius 3 inches is given by the area of D3 divided by the area of D. In
other words, the probability that the dart strikes the disk D3 is

100π

The integrand, 100π
, may be thought of as a distribution function, describing how the dart strikes
are distributed across the board. In this case the distribution function is constant since we are
assuming a uniform distribution, but we can easily envision situations where the distribution
function varies. For example, if the player is fairly good and is aiming for the bulls eye (the center
of D), then the distribution function f could be skewed toward the center, say

f (x, y) = Ke−(x

2 +y 2 )

for some constant positive K. If we assume that the player is consistent enough so that the dart
always strikes the board, then the probability that the dart strikes the board somewhere is 1, and
the distribution function f will have to satisfy3
ZZ
f (x, y) dA = 1.
D

For such a function f , the probability that the dart strikes in the disk D1 of radius 1 would be
ZZ
f (x, y) dA.
D1

Indeed, the probability that the dart strikes in any region R that lies within D is given by
ZZ
f (x, y) dA.

The preceding discussion highlights the general idea behind calculating probabilities. We assume we have a joint probability density function f , a function of two independent variables x and
y defined on a domain D that satisfies the conditions

Activity 11.12.
A firm manufactures smoke detectors. Two components for the detectors come from different
suppliers – one in Michigan and one in Ohio. The company studies these components for
their reliability and their data suggests that if x is the life span (in years) of a randomly chosen
component from the Michigan supplier and y the life span (in years) of a randomly chosen
component from the Ohio supplier, then the joint probability density function f might be given
by
f (x, y) = e−x e−y .

Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What are the polar coordinates of a point in two-space?
• How do we convert between polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates?
• What is the area element in polar coordinates?
• How do we convert a double integral in rectangular coordinates to a double integral in
polar coordinates?

Introduction
While we have naturally defined double integrals in the rectangular coordinate system, starting
with domains that are rectangular regions, there are many of these integrals that are difficult,
if not impossible, to evaluate. For example, consider the domain D that is the unit circle and

For this particular integral, regardless of the order of integration, we are unable to find an antiderivative of the integrand; in addition, even if we were able to find an antiderivative, the inner
limits of integration involve relatively complicated functions.
It is useful, therefore, to be able to translate to other coordinate systems where the limits of
integration and evaluation of the involved integrals is simpler. In this section we provide a quick
discussion of one such system – polar coordinates – and then introduce and investigate their ramifications for double integrals. The rectangular coordinate system allows us to consider domains
and graphs relative to a rectangular grid. The polar coordinate system is an alternate coordinate
system that allows us to consider domains less suited to rectangular coordinates, such as circles.
Preview Activity 11.5. The coordinates of a point determine its location. In particular, the rectangular coordinates of a point P are given by an ordered pair (x, y), where x is the (signed) distance
the point lies from the y-axis to P and y is the (signed) distance the point lies from the x-axis to P .
In polar coordinates, we locate the point by considering the distance the point lies from the origin,
(0, 0), and the angle the line segment from the origin to P forms with the positive x-axis.
(a) Determine the rectangular coordinates of the following points:
i. The point P that lies 1 unit from the origin on the positive x-axis.

A Quick Overview of Polar Coordinates
The rectangular coordinate system is best suited for graphs and regions that are naturally considered over a rectangular grid. The polar coordinate system is an alternative that offers good
options for functions and domains that have more circular characteristics. A point P in rectangular coordinates that is described by an ordered pair (x, y), where x is the displacement from
P to the y-axis and y is the displacement from P to the x-axis, as seen in Preview Activity 11.5,
can also be described with polar coordinates (r, θ), where r is the distance from P to the origin
and θ is the angle formed by the line segment OP and the positive x-axis, as shown in Figure
11.22. Trigonometry and the Pythagorean Theorem allow for straightforward conversion from
rectangular to polar, and vice versa.
Converting from rectangular to polar. If we are given the rectangular coordinates (x, y) of a
point P , then the polar coordinates (r, θ) of P satisfy
r=

and

tan(θ) =

Converting from polar to rectangular. If we are given the polar coordinates (r, θ) of a point
P , then the rectangular coordinates (x, y) of P satisfy
x = r cos(θ)

and

y = r sin(θ).

We can draw graphs of curves in polar coordinates in a similar way to how we do in rectangular coordinates. However, when plotting in polar coordinates, we use a grid that considers
changes in angles and changes in distance from the origin. In particular, the angles θ and distances
r partition the plane into small wedges as shown in Figure 11.23.

Activity 11.13.
Most polar graphing devices4 can plot curves in polar coordinates of the form r = f (θ). Use
such a device to complete this activity.
(a) Before plotting the polar curve r = 1, think about what shape it should have, in light of
how r is connected to x and y. Then use appropriate technology to draw the graph and
test your intuition.
(b) The equation θ = 1 does not define r as a function of θ, so we can’t graph this equation
on many polar plotters. What do you think the graph of the polar curve θ = 1 looks
like? Why?
(c) Before plotting the polar curve r = θ, what do you think the graph looks like? Why?
Use technology to plot the curve and compare your intuition.
(d) What about the curve r = sin(θ)? After plotting this curve, experiment with others of
your choosing and think about why the curves look the way they do.

in rectangular coordinates, because we know that dA = dy dx in rectangular coordinates. To make
the change to polar coordinates, we not only need to represent the variables x and y in polar
coordinates, but we also must understand how to write the area element, dA, in polar coordinates.
That is, we must determine how the area element dA can be written in terms of dr and dθ in the
context of polar coordinates. We address this question in the following activity.

Consider a polar rectangle R, with r between ri and ri+1 and θ between θj and θj+1 as shown
in Figure 11.24. Let ∆r = ri+1 − ri and ∆θ = θj+1 − θj . Let ∆A be the area of this region.
(a) Explain why the area ∆A in polar coordinates is not ∆r ∆θ.
(b) Now find ∆A by the following steps:
i. Find the area of the annulus (the washer-like region) between ri and ri+1 , as shown
at right in Figure 11.25. This area will be in terms of ri and ri+1 .

222

11.5. DOUBLE INTEGRALS IN POLAR COORDINATES
ii. Observe that the region R is only a portion of the annulus, so the area ∆A of R is
only a fraction of the area of the annulus. For instance, if θi+1 − θi were π4 , then the
resulting wedge would be
π

of the entire annulus. In this more general context, using the wedge between the
two noted angles, what fraction of the area of the annulus is the area ∆A?
iii. Write an expression for ∆A in terms of ri , ri+1 , θj , and θj+1 .
iv. Finally, write the area ∆A in terms of ri , ri+1 , ∆r, and ∆θ, where each quantity
appears only once in the expression. (Hint: Think about how to factor a difference
of squares.)
(c) As we take the limit as ∆r and ∆θ go to 0, ∆r becomes dr, ∆θ becomes dθ, and ∆A
becomes dA, the area element. Using your work in (iv), write dA in terms of r, dr, and
dθ.
C

From the result of Activity 11.14, we see when we convert an integral from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we must not only convert x and y to being in terms of r and θ, but we
also have to change
RR the area element to dA = r dr dθ in polar coordinates. In other words, given
a double integral D f (x, y) dA in rectangular coordinates, to write a corresponding iterated integral in polar coordinates, we replace x with r cos(θ), y with r sin(θ) and dA with r dr dθ. Of course,
we need to describe the region D in polar coordinates as well. To summarize:

Surfaces Defined Parametrically and Surface Area

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What is a parameterization of a surface?
• How do we find the surface area of a parametrically defined surface?

Introduction
We have now studied at length how curves in space can be defined parametrically by functions
of the form r(t) = hx(t), y(t), z(t)i, and surfaces can be represented by functions z = f (x, y). In
what follows, we will see how we can also define surfaces parametrically. A one-dimensional
curve in space results from a vector function that relies upon one parameter, so a two-dimensional
surface naturally involves the use of two parameters. If x = x(s, t), y = y(s, t), and z = z(s, t) are
functions of independent parameters s and t, then the terminal points of all vectors of the form
r(s, t) = x(s, t)i + y(s, t)j + z(s, t)k
form a surface in space. The equations x = x(s, t), y = y(s, t), and z = z(s, t) are the parametric
equations for the surface, or a parametrization of the surface. In Preview Activity 11.6 we investigate
how to parameterize a cylinder and a cone.
Preview Activity 11.6. Recall the standard parameterization of the unit circle that is given by
x(t) = cos(t)

and

y(t) = sin(t),

where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π.
(a) Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in R3 that has its center at (0, 0, 1)
and lies in the plane z = 1.
(b) Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in 3-space that has its center at
(0, 0, −1) and lies in the plane z = −1.
(c) Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in 3-space that has its center at
(0, 0, 5) and lies in the plane z = 5.
(d) Taking into account your responses in (a), (b), and (c), describe the graph that results from
the set of parametric equations
x(s, t) = cos(t),

y(s, t) = sin(t),

and

where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π and −5 ≤ s ≤ 5. Explain your thinking.

z(s, t) = s,

11.6. SURFACES DEFINED PARAMETRICALLY AND SURFACE AREA

227

(e) Just as a cylinder can be viewed as a “stack” of circles of constant radius, a cone can be
viewed as a stack of circles with varying radius. Modify the parametrizations of the circles
above in order to construct the parameterization of a cone whose vertex lies at the origin,
whose base radius is 4, and whose height is 3, where the base of the cone lies in the plane
z = 3. Use appropriate technology5 to plot the parametric equations you develop. (Hint:
The cross sections parallel to the xz plane are circles, with the radii varying linearly as z
increases.)
./

Parametric Surfaces
In a single-variable setting, any function may have its graph expressed parametrically. For instance, given y = g(x), by considering the parameterization ht, g(t)i (where t belongs to the domain of g), we generate the same curve. What is more important is that certain curves that are not
functions may be represented parametrically; for instance, the circle (which cannot be represented
by a single function) can be parameterized by hcos(t), sin(t)i, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π.
In the same way, in a two-variable setting, the surface z = f (x, y) may be expressed parametrically by considering
hx(s, t), y(s, t), z(s, t)i = hs, t, f (s, t)i,

where (s, t) varies over the entire domain of f . Therefore, any familiar surface that we have studied so far can be generated as a parametric surface. But what is more powerful is that there are
surfaces that cannot be generated by a single function z = f (x, y) (such as the unit sphere), but
that can be represented parametrically. We now consider an important example.
Example 11.3. Consider the torus (or doughnut) shown in Figure 11.27.

Figure 11.27: A torus
To find a parametrization of this torus, we recall our work in Preview Activity 11.6. There,
we saw that a circle of radius r that has its center at the point (0, 0, z0 ) and is contained in the

where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π.

To obtain the torus in Figure 11.27, we begin with a circle of radius a in the xz-plane centered
at (b, 0), as shown on the left of Figure 11.29. We may parametrize the points on this circle, using
the parameter s, by using the equations
x(s) = b + a cos(s)

z(s) = a sin(s),

and

where 0 ≤ s ≤ 2π.

Let’s focus our attention on one point on this circle, such as the indicated point, which has
coordinates (x(s), 0, z(s)) for a fixed value of the parameter s. When this point is revolved about
the z-axis, we obtain a circle contained in a horizontal plane centered at (0, 0, z(s)) and having
radius x(s), as shown on the right of Figure 11.29. If we let t be the new parameter that generates
the circle for the rotation about the z-axis, this circle may be parametrized by
r(s, t) = x(s) cos(t)i + x(s) sin(t)j + z(s)k.

11.6. SURFACES DEFINED PARAMETRICALLY AND SURFACE AREA

229

Now using our earlier parametric equations for x(s) and z(s) for the original smaller circle, we
have an overall parameterization of the torus given by
r(s, t) = (b + a cos(s)) cos(t)i + (b + a cos(s)) sin(t)j + a sin(s)k.
To trace out the entire torus, we require that the parameters vary through the values 0 ≤ s ≤ 2π
and 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π.

Activity 11.17.
In this activity, we seek a parametrization of the sphere of radius R centered at the origin,
as shown on the left in Figure 11.30. Notice that this sphere may be obtained by revolving a
half-circle contained in the xz-plane about the z-axis, as shown on the right.

Be sure to state the domain of the parameter s.
(b) By revolving the points on this half-circle about the z-axis, obtain a parametrization
r(s, t) of the points on the sphere of radius R. Be sure to include the domain of both
parameters s and t. (Hint: What is the radius of the circle obtained when revolving a
point on the half-circle around the z axis?)
(c) Draw the surface defined by your parameterization with appropriate technology6 .

The Surface Area of Parametrically Defined Surfaces
Recall that a differentiable function is locally linear – that is, if we zoom in on the surface around
a point, the surface looks like its tangent plane. We now exploit this idea in order to determine

11.6. SURFACES DEFINED PARAMETRICALLY AND SURFACE AREA

the surface area generated by a parametrization hx(s, t), y(s, t), z(s, t)i. The basic idea is a familiar
one: we will subdivide the surface into small pieces, in the approximate shape of small parallelograms, and thus estimate the entire the surface area by adding the areas of these approximation
parallelograms. Ultimately, we use an integral to sum these approximations and determine the
exact surface area.
Let
r(s, t) = x(s, t)i + y(s, t)j + z(s, t)k
define a surface over a rectangular domain a ≤ s ≤ b and c ≤ t ≤ d. As a function of two variables,
s and t, it is natural to consider the two partial derivatives of the vector-valued function r, which
we define by
rs (s, t) = xs (s, t)i + ys (s, t)j + zs (s, t)k

and

rt (s, t) = xt (s, t)i + yt (s, t)j + zt (s, t)k.

In the usual way, we slice the domain into small rectangles. In particular, we partition the interval
[a, b] into m subintervals of length ∆s = b−a
n and let s0 , s1 , . . ., sm be the endpoints of these
subintervals, where a = s0 < s1 < s2 < · · · < sm = b. Also partition the interval [c, d] into n
subintervals of equal length ∆t = d−c
n and let t0 , t1 , . . ., tn be the endpoints of these subintervals,
where c = t0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tn = d. These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle
R = [a, b] × [c, d] in st-coordinates into mn sub-rectangles Rij with opposite vertices (si−1 , tj−1 )
and (si , tj ) for i between 1 and m and j between 1 and n. These rectangles all have equal area
∆A = ∆s · ∆t.
Now we want to think about the small piece of area on the surface itself that lies above one of
these small rectangles in the domain. Observe that if we increase s by a small amount ∆s from
the point (si−1 , tj−1 ) in the domain, then r changes by approximately rs (si−1 , tj−1 )∆s. Similarly,
if we increase t by a small amount ∆t from the point (si−1 , tj−1 ), then r changes by approximately
rt (si−1 , tj−1 )∆t. So we can approximate the surface defined by r on the st-rectangle [si−1 , si ] ×
[tj−1 , tj ] with the parallelogram determined by the vectors rs (si−1 , tj−1 )∆s and rt (si−1 , tj−1 )∆t,
as seen in Figure 11.31.

Figure 11.31: Approximation surface area with a parallelogram.
Say that the small parallelogram has area Sij . If we can find its area, then all that remains is to
sum the areas of all of the generated parallelograms and take a limit. Recall from our earlier work

11.6. SURFACES DEFINED PARAMETRICALLY AND SURFACE AREA

231

in the course that given two vectors u and v, the area of the parallelogram spanned by u and v is
given by the magnitude of their cross product, |u × v|. In the present context, it follows that the
area, Sij , of the parallelogram determined by the vectors rs (si−1 , tj−1 )∆s and rt (si−1 , tj−1 )∆t is
Sij = |(rs (si−1 , tj−1 )∆s) × (rt (si−1 , tj−1 )∆t)| = |rs (si−1 , tj−1 ) × rt (si−1 , tj−1 )|∆s∆t,

(11.3)

where the latter equality holds from standard properties of the cross product and length.
We sum the surface area approximations from Equation (11.3) over all sub-rectangles to obtain
an estimate for the total surface area, S, given by
S≈

As we noted earlier, we can take any surface z = f (x, y) and generate a corresponding parameterization for the surface by writing hs, t, f (s, t)i. Hence, we can use our recent work with
parametrically defined surfaces to find the surface area that is generated by a function f = f (x, y)
over a given domain.

the surface in terms of two independent parameters.

Triple Integrals

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• How are a triple Riemann sum and the corresponding triple integral of a continuous function f = f (x, y, z) defined?
• What are two things the triple integral of a function can tell us?

Introduction
We have now learned that we define the double integral of a continuous function f = f (x, y) over
a rectangle R = [a, b] × [c, d] as a limit of a double Riemann sum, and that these ideas parallel the
single-variable integral of a function g = g(x) on an interval [a, b]. Moreover, this double integral
has natural interpretations and applications, and can even be considered over non-rectangular
regions, D. For instance, given a continuous function f over a region D, the average value of f ,
fAVG(D) , is given by
ZZ
1
fAVG(R) =
f (x, y) dA,
A(D) D
where A(D) is the area of D. Likewise, if δ(x, y) describes a mass density function on a lamina
over D, the mass, M , of the lamina is given by
ZZ
M=
δ(x, y) dA.
D

It is natural to wonder if it is possible to extend these ideas of double Riemann sums and
double integrals for functions of two variables to triple Riemann sums and then triple integrals
for functions of three variables. We begin investigating in Preview Activity 11.7.
Preview Activity 11.7. Consider a solid piece granite in the shape of a box B = {(x, y, z) : 0 ≤
x ≤ 4, 0 ≤ y ≤ 6, 0 ≤ z ≤ 8}, whose density varies from point to point. Let δ(x, y, z) represent
the mass density of the piece of granite at point (x, y, z) in kilograms per cubic meter (so we are
measuring x, y, and z in meters). Our goal is to find the mass of this solid.
Recall that if the density was constant, we could find the mass by multiplying the density and
volume; since the density varies from point to point, we will use the approach we did with twovariable lamina problems, and slice the solid into small pieces on which the density is roughly
constant.
Partition the interval [0, 4] into 2 subintervals of equal length, the interval [0, 6] into 3 subintervals of equal length, and the interval [0, 8] into 2 subintervals of equal length. This partitions the
box B into sub-boxes as shown in Figure 11.33.

Triple Riemann Sums and Triple Integrals
Through the application of a mass density distribution over a three-dimensional solid, Preview
Activity 11.7 suggests that the generalization from double Riemann sums of functions of two
variables to triple Riemann sums of functions of three variables is natural. In the same way, so
is the generalization from double integrals to triple integrals. By simply adding a z-coordinate to

11.7. TRIPLE INTEGRALS

237

our earlier work, we can define both a triple Riemann sum and the corresponding triple integral.
The Triple Riemann Sum.
Definition 11.3. Let f = f (x, y, z) be a continuous function on a box B = [a, b] × [c, d] × [r, s].
The triple Riemann sum of f over B is created as follows.
• Partition the interval [a, b] into m subintervals of equal length ∆x = b−a
m . Let x0 , x1 , . . .,
xm be the endpoints of these subintervals, where a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xm = b. Do
likewise with the interval [c, d] using n subintervals of equal length ∆y = d−c
n to generate
c = y0 < y1 < y2 < · · · < yn = d, and with the interval [r, s] using ` subintervals of equal
length ∆z = s−r
` to have r = z0 < z1 < z2 < · · · < zl = s.
• Let Bijk be the sub-box of B with opposite vertices (xi−1 , yj−1 , zk−1 ) and (xi , yj , zk ) for i
between 1 and m, j between 1 and n, and k between 1 and `. The volume of each Bijk is
∆V = ∆x · ∆y · ∆z.

If f (x, y, z) represents the mass density of the box B, then, as we saw in Preview Activity 11.7,
the triple Riemann sum approximates the total mass of the box B. In order to find the exact mass
of the box, we need to let the number of sub-boxes increase without bound (in other words, let m,
n, and ` go to infinity); in this case, the finite sum of the mass approximations becomes the actual
mass of the solid B. More generally, we have the following definition of the triple integral.

boxed information. Note that each of these quantities may actually be considered over a general
domain S in R3 , not simply a box, B.

Figure 11.34: At right, the cone; at left, its projection.

i. If we think about slicing up the solid, we can consider slicing the domain of the
solid’s projection onto the xy-plane (just as we would slice a two-dimensional region in R2 ), and then slice in the z-direction as well. The projection of the solid
is onto the xy-plane is shown at left in Figure 11.34. If we decide to first slice the
domain of the solid’s projection perpendicular to the x-axis, over what range of
constant x-values would we have to slice?
ii. If we continue with slicing the domain, what are the limits on y on a typical slice?
How do these depend on x? What, therefore, are the limits on the middle integral?
iii. Finally, now that we have thought about slicing up the two-dimensional domain
that is the projection of the cone, what are the limits on z in the innermost integral?
Note that over any point (x, y) in the plane, a vertical slice in the z direction will
involve a range of values from the cone itself to its flat top. In particular, observe
that at least one of these limits is not constant but depends on x and y.
iv. In conclusion, write an iterated integral of the form (11.5) that represents the mass
of the cone S.
C
Note well: When setting up iterated integrals, the limits on a given variable can be only in terms
of the remaining variables. In addition, there are multiple different ways we can choose to set up
such

240

11.7. TRIPLE INTEGRALS

in any order. Of course, in many circumstances, an insightful choice of variable order will make it
easier to set up an iterated integral, just as was the case when we worked with double integrals.
Example 11.4. Find the mass of the tetrahedron in the first octant bounded by the coordinate
planes and the plane x + 2y + 3z = 6 if the density at point (x, y, z) is given by δ(x, y, z) = x + y + z.

We find the mass, M , of the tetrahedron by the triple integral
ZZZ
M=

δ(x, y, z) dV,
S

where S is the solid tetrahedron described above. In this example, we choose to integrate with
respect to z first for the innermost integral. The top of the tetrahedron is given by the equation
x + 2y + 3z = 6;
solving for z then yields
1
z = (6 − x − 2y).
3
The bottom of the tetrahedron is the xy-plane, so the limits on z in the iterated integral will be
0 ≤ z ≤ 13 (6 − x − 2y).

To find the bounds on x and y we project the tetrahedron onto the xy-plane; this corresponds
to setting z = 0 in the equation z = 31 (6 − x − 2y). The resulting relation between x and y is
x + 2y = 6.

The right image in Figure 11.35 shows the projection of the tetrahedron onto the xy-plane.
If we choose to integrate with respect to y for the middle integral in the iterated integral, then
the lower limit on y is the x-axis and the upper limit is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Note that
the hypotenuse joins the points (6, 0) and (0, 3) and so has equation y = 3 − 21 x. Thus, the bounds

11.7. TRIPLE INTEGRALS

241

on y are 0 ≤ y ≤ 3 − 12 x. Finally, the x values run from 0 to 6, so the iterated integral that gives the

Setting up limits on iterated integrals can require considerable geometric intuition. It is important to not only create carefully labeled figures, but also to think about how we wish to slice
the solid. Further, note that when we say “we will integrate first with respect to x,” by “first” we
are referring to the innermost integral in the iterated integral. The next activity explores several
different ways we might set up the integral in the preceding example.

Activity 11.21.
There are several other ways we could have set up the integral to give the mass of the tetrahedron in Example 11.4.
(a) How many different iterated integrals could be set up that are equal to the integral in
Equation (11.6)?
(b) Set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to z, then x, then y that is
equivalent to the integral in Equation (11.6). Before you write down the integral, think
about Figure 11.35, and draw an appropriate two-dimensional image of an important
projection.
(c) Set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to y, then z, then x that is equivalent to the integral in Equation (11.6). As in (b), think carefully about the geometry
first.

them to determine important quantities, such as those found in the next activity.

Triple Integrals in Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates

Motivating Questions
In this section, we strive to understand the ideas generated by the following important questions:
• What are the cylindrical coordinates of a point, and how are they related to Cartesian coordinates?
• What is the volume element in cylindrical coordinates? How does this inform us about
evaluating a triple integral as an iterated integral in cylindrical coordinates?
• What are the spherical coordinates of a point, and how are they related to Cartesian coordinates?
• What is the volume element in spherical coordinates? How does this inform us about evaluating a triple integral as an iterated integral in spherical coordinates?

Introduction
We have encountered two different coordinate systems in R2 – the rectangular and polar coordinates systems – and seen how in certain situations, polar coordinates form a convenient alternative. In a similar way, there there turn out to be two additional natural coordinate systems in R3 .
Given that we are already familiar with the Cartesian coordinate system for R3 , we next investigate
the cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems (each of which builds upon polar coordinates in
R2 ). In what follows, we will see how to convert among the different coordinate systems, how to
evaluate triple integrals using them, and some situations in which these other coordinate systems
prove advantageous.
Preview Activity 11.8. In the following questions, we investigate the two new coordinate systems
that are the subject of this section: cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Our goal is to consider
some examples of how to convert from rectangular coordinates to each of these systems, and vice
versa. Triangles and trigonometry prove to be particularly important.
The cylindrical coordinates of a point in R3 are given by (r, θ, z) where r and θ are the polar
coordinates of the point (x, y) and z is the same z coordinate as in Cartesian coordinates. An
illustration is given in Figure 11.41.

The spherical coordinates of a point in R3 are ρ (rho), θ, and φ (phi), where ρ is the distance from
the point to the origin, θ has the same interpretation it does in polar coordinates, and φ is the angle

(c) What is the distance from P to the origin? Your result is the value of ρ in the spherical
coordinates of P .
(d) Determine the point that is the projection of P onto the xy-plane. Then, use this projection to
find the value of θ in the polar coordinates of the projection of P that lies in the plane. Your
result is also the value of θ for the spherical coordinates of the point.
(e) Based on the illustration in Figure 11.42, how is the angle φ determined by ρ and the z coordinate of P ? Use a well-chosen right triangle to find the value of φ, which is the final
component in the spherical coordinates of P . Draw a carefully labeled picture that clearly
illustrates the values of ρ, θ, and φ in this example, along with the original rectangular coordinates of P .
(f) Based on your responses to (c), (d), and (e), if we are given the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z)
of a point Q, how are the values of ρ, θ, and φ in the spherical coordinates of Q determined
by x, y, and z?
./

Cylindrical Coordinates
As we stated in Preview Activity 11.8, the cylindrical coordinates of a point are (r, θ, z), where r
and θ are the polar coordinates of the point (x, y), and z is the same z coordinate as in Cartesian
coordinates. The general situation is illustrated Figure 11.41.

248

11.8. TRIPLE INTEGRALS IN CYLINDRICAL AND SPHERICAL COORDINATES

Since we already know how to convert between rectangular and polar coordinates in the plane,
and the z coordinate is identical in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates, the conversion
equations between the two systems in R3 are essentially those we found for polar coordinates:
x = r cos(θ)

y = r sin(θ)

r 2 = x2 + y 2

tan(θ) =

y
x

z=z
z = z.

Just as with rectangular coordinates, where we usually write z as a function of x and y to
plot the resulting surface, in cylindrical coordinates, we often express z as a function of r and
θ. In the following activity, we explore several basic equations in cylindrical coordinates and the
corresponding surface each generates.

Activity 11.23.
In this activity, we graph some surfaces using cylindrical coordinates. To improve your intuition and test your understanding, you should first think about what each graph should look
like before you plot it using technology.8
(a) Plot the graph of the cylindrical equation r = 2, where we restrict the values of θ and
z to the intervals 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π and 0 ≤ z ≤ 2. What familiar shape does the resulting
surface take? How does this example suggest that we call these coordinates cylindrical
coordinates?
(b) Plot the graph of the cylindrical equation θ = 2, where we restrict the other variables to
the values 0 ≤ r ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ z ≤ 2. What familiar surface results?
(c) Plot the graph of the cylindrical equation z = 2, using 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π and 0 ≤ r ≤ 2. What
does this surface look like?
(d) Plot the graph of the cylindrical equation z = r, where 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π and 0 ≤ r ≤ 2. What
familiar surface results?
(e) Plot the graph of the cylindrical equation z = θ for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 4π. What does this surface
look like?
C
As the name and Activity 11.23 suggest, cylindrical coordinates are useful for describing surfaces that are cylindrical in nature.

the volume element dV in cylindrical coordinates.

Activity 11.24.
A picture of a cylindrical box, B = {(r, θ, z) : r1 ≤ r ≤ r2 , θ1 ≤ θ ≤ θ2 , z1 ≤ z ≤ z2 }, is shown
in Figure 11.43. Let ∆r = r2 − r1 , ∆θ = θ2 − θ1 , and ∆z = z2 − z1 . We want to determine the
volume ∆V of B in terms of ∆r, ∆θ, ∆z, r, θ, and z.

blue in Figure 11.43. Recall that we previously determined the area ∆A in polar coordinates in terms of r, ∆r, and ∆θ. In light of the fact that we know ∆A and that z is the
standard z coordinate from Cartesian coordinates, what is the volume ∆V in cylindrical
coordinates?

Activity 11.24 demonstrates that the volume element dV in cylindrical coordinates is given by
dV = r dz dr dθ, and hence the following rule holds in general.

Of course, to complete the task of writing an iterated integral in cylindrical coordinates, we
need to determine the limits on the three integrals: θ, r, and z. In the following activity, we explore
how to do this in several situations where cylindrical coordinates are natural and advantageous.

Spherical Coordinates
As we saw in Preview Activity 11.8, the spherical coordinates of a point in 3-space have the form
(ρ, θ, φ), where ρ is the distance from the point to the origin, θ has the same meaning as in polar
coordinates, and φ is the angle between the positive z axis and the vector from the origin to the
point. The overall situation is illustrated in Figure 11.42.
The example in Preview Activity 11.8 suggests that given a point in rectangular coordinates,
(x, y, z), we can find the corresponding spherical coordinates. Indeed, this holds generally by

To convert from given spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, we use the equations

y = ρ sin(φ) sin(θ)

z = ρ cos(φ),

as illustrated in Figure 11.47.
When it comes to thinking about particular surfaces in spherical coordinates, similar to our
work with cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates, we usually write ρ as a function of θ and φ; this
is a natural analog to polar coordinates, where we often think of our distance from the origin in
the plane as being a function of θ. In spherical coordinates, we likewise often view ρ as a function
of θ and φ, thus viewing distance from the origin as a function of two key angles.

(with ∆φ = φ2 − φ1 ), and θ1 ≤ θ ≤ θ2 (with ∆θ = θ2 − θ1 ). An illustration of such a box is given
in Figure 11.48. This spherical box is a bit more complicated than the cylindrical box we encountered earlier. In this situation, it is easier to approximate the volume ∆V than to compute
it directly. Here we can approximate the volume ∆V of this spherical box with the volume of a
Cartesian box whose sides have the lengths of the sides of this spherical box. In other words,

we naturally consider the change of variable u = x2 + 1. From this substitution, it follows that
du = 2x dx, and since x = 0 implies u = 1 and x = 2 implies u = 5, we have transformed the
original integral in x into a new integral in u. In particular,

The latter integral, of course, is far easier to evaluate.
Through our work with polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates, we have already implicitly seen some of the issues that arise in using a change of variables with two or three variables
present. In what follows, we seek to understand the general ideas behind any change of variables
in a multiple integral.

11.9. CHANGE OF VARIABLES

When we write the double integral (11.7) as an iterated integral in polar coordinates we make a
change of variables, namely
x = r cos(θ)

and

y = r sin(θ).

(11.8)

We also then have to change dA to r dr dθ. This process also identifies a “polar rectangle” [r1 , r2 ] ×
[θ1 , θ2 ] with the original Cartesian rectangle, under the transformation10 in Equation (11.8). The
vertices of the polar rectangle are transformed into the vertices of a closed and bounded region in
rectangular coordinates.
To work with a numerical example, let’s now consider the polar rectangle P given by [1, 2]×[ π6 , π4 ],
so that r1 = 1, r2 = 2, θ1 = π6 , and θ2 = π4 .

(c) Use the transformation determined by the equations in (11.8) to find the rectangular vertices
that correspond to the polar vertices in the polar rectangle P . In other words, by substituting appropriate values of r and θ into the two equations in (11.8), find the values of the
corresponding x and y coordinates for the vertices of the polar rectangle P . Label the point
that corresponds to the polar vertex (r1 , θ1 ) as (x1 , y1 ), the point corresponding to the polar
vertex (r2 , θ1 ) as (x2 , y2 ), the point corresponding to the polar vertex (r1 , θ2 ) as (x3 , y3 ), and
the point corresponding to the polar vertex (r2 , θ2 ) as (x4 , y4 ).
(d) Draw a picture of the figure in rectangular coordinates that has the points (x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ),
(x3 , y3 ), and (x4 , y4 ) as vertices. (Note carefully that because of the trigonometric functions
in the transformation, this region will not look like a Cartesian rectangle.) What is the area
of this region in rectangular coordinates? How does this area compare to the area of the
original polar rectangle?
./

Change of Variables in Polar Coordinates
The general idea behind a change of variables is suggested by Preview Activity 11.9. There, we
saw that in a change of variables from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, a polar rectangle [r1 , r2 ] × [θ1 , θ2 ] gets mapped to a Cartesian rectangle under the transformation
x = r cos(θ)

and

y = r sin(θ).

The vertices of the polar rectangle P are transformed into the vertices of a closed and bounded
region P 0 in rectangular coordinates. If we view the standard coordinate system as having the
horizontal axis represent r and the vertical axis represent θ, then the polar rectangle P appears to
10
A transformation is another name for function: here, the equations x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ) define a function
T by T (r, θ) = (r cos(θ), r sin(θ)) so that T is a function (transformation) from R2 to R2 . We view this transformation
as mapping a version of the x-y plane where the axes are viewed as representing r and θ (the r-θ plane) to the familiar
x-y plane.

us at left in Figure 11.51. The image P 0 of the polar rectangle P under the transformation given
by (11.8) is shown at right in Figure 11.51. We thus see that there is a correspondence between a
simple region (a traditional, right-angled rectangle) and a more complicated region (a fraction of
an annulus) under the function T given by T (r, θ) = (r cos(θ), r sin(θ)).

Figure 11.51: A rectangle P and its image P 0 .
Furthermore, as Preview Activity 11.9 suggest, it follows generally that for an original polar
1
rectangle P = [r1 , r2 ] × [θ1 , θ2 ], the area of the transformed rectangle P 0 is given by r2 +r
2 ∆r∆θ.
Therefore, as ∆r and ∆θ go to 0 this area becomes the familiar area element dA = r dr dθ in polar
coordinates. When we proceed to working with other transformations for different changes in
coordinates, we have to understand how the transformation affects area so that we may use the
correct area element in the new system of variables.

General Change of Coordinates
We first focus on double integrals. As with single integrals, we may be able to simplify a double
integral of the form
ZZ
f (x, y) dA
D

by making a change of variables (that is, a substitution) of the form
x = x(s, t)

and

y = y(s, t)

where x and y are functions of new variables s and t. This transformation introduces a correspondence between a problem in the xy-plane and one in the the st-plane. The equations x = x(s, t)
and y = y(s, t) convert s and t to x and y; we call these formulas the change of variable formulas. To
complete the change to the new s, t variables, we need to understand the area element, dA, in this
new system. The following activity helps to illustrate the idea.

11.9. CHANGE OF VARIABLES

Let’s see what happens to the rectangle T = [0, 1] × [1, 4] in the st-plane under this change of
variable.
(a) Draw a labeled picture of T in the st-plane.
(b) Find the image of the st-vertex (0, 1) in the xy-plane. Likewise, find the respective
images of the other three vertices of the rectangle T : (0, 4), (1, 1), and (1, 4).
(c) In the xy-plane, draw a labeled picture of the image, T 0 , of the original st-rectangle T .
What appears to be the shape of the image, T 0 ?
(d) To transform an integral with a change of variables, we need to determine the area
element dA for image of the transformed rectangle. How would we find the area of the
xy-figure T 0 ? (Hint: Remember what the cross product of two vectors tells us.)
C
Activity 11.29 presents the general idea of how a change of variables works. We partition
a rectangular domain in the st system into subrectangles. Let T = [a, b] × [a + ∆s, b + ∆t] be
one of these subrectangles. Then we transform this into a region T 0 in the standard xy Cartesian
coordinate system. The region T 0 is called the image of T ; the region T is the pre-image of T 0 .
Although the sides of this xy region T 0 aren’t necessarily straight (linear), we will approximate the
element of area dA for this region with the area of the parallelogram whose sides are given by the
vectors v and w, where v is the vector from (x(a, b), y(a, b)) to (x(a + ∆s, b), y(a + ∆s, b)), and w
is the vector from (x(a, b), y(a, b)) to (x(a, b + ∆t), y(a, b + ∆t)).
An example of an image T 0 in the xy plane that results from a transformation of a rectangle T
in the st plane is shown in Figure 11.52.

The components of the vector v are

and similarly those for w are
w = hx(a, b + ∆t) − x(a, b), y(a, b + ∆s) − y(a, b), 0i .

What do you observe about your result? How is this connected to our earlier work with double

C
Given a particular double integral, it is natural to ask, “how can we find a useful change of
variables?” There are two general factors to consider: if the integrand is particularly difficult,
we might choose a change of variables that would make the integrand easier; or, given a complicated region of integration, we might choose a change of variables that transforms the region of
integration into one that has a simpler form. These ideas are illustrated in the next activities.

Summary
• If an integral is described in terms of one set of variables, we may write that set of variables in
terms of another set of the same number of variables. If the new variables are chosen appropriately, the transformed integral may be easier to evaluate.
• The Jacobian is a scalar function that relates the area or volume element in one coordinate
system to the corresponding element in a new system determined by a change of variables.
