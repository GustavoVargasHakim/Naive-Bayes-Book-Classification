What is Linear Algebra?

Many difficult problems can be handled easily once relevant information is
organized in a certain way. This text aims to teach you how to organize information in cases where certain mathematical structures are present. Linear
algebra is, in general, the study of those structures. Namely
Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear functions.
In broad terms, vectors are things you can add and linear functions are
functions of vectors that respect vector addition. The goal of this text is to
teach you to organize information about vector spaces in a way that makes
problems involving linear functions of many variables easy. (Or at least
tractable.)
To get a feel for the general idea of organizing information, of vectors,
and of linear functions this chapter has brief sections on each. We start
here in hopes of putting students in the right mindset for the odyssey that
follows; the latter chapters cover the same material at a slower pace. Please
be prepared to change the way you think about some familiar mathematical
objects and keep a pencil and piece of paper handy!

1.1

Organizing Information

Functions of several variables are often presented in one line such as
f (x, y) = 3x + 5y .

What is Linear Algebra?
But lets think carefully; what is the left hand side of this equation doing?
Functions and equations are different mathematical objects so why is the

If someone says
“Consider the function of two variables 7β − 13b.”
we do not quite have all the information we need to determine the relationship
between inputs and outputs.
Example 1 (Of organizing and reorganizing information)
You own stock in 3 companies: Google, N etf lix, and Apple. The value V of your
stock portfolio as a function of the number of shares you own sN , sG , sA of these
companies is
24sG + 80sA + 35sN .
 
1

Here is an ill posed question: what is V 2?
3
The column of three numbers is ambiguous! Is it is meant to denote
• 1 share of G, 2 shares of N and 3 shares of A?
• 1 share of N , 2 shares of G and 3 shares of A?
Do we multiply the first number of the input by 24 or by 35? No one has specified an
order for the variables, so we do not know how to calculate an output associated with
a particular input.1
A different notation for V can clear this up; we can denote V itself as an ordered
triple of numbers that reminds us what to do to each number from the input.
1

Of course we would know how to calculate an output if the input is described in
the tedious form such as “1 share of G, 2 shares of N and 3 shares of A”, but that is
unacceptably tedious! We want to use ordered triples of numbers to concisely describe
inputs.

The subscripts B and B 0 on the columns of numbers are just symbols2 reminding us
of how to interpret the column of numbers. But the distinction is critical; as shown
above V assigns completely different numbers to the same columns of numbers with
different subscripts.
There are six different ways to order the three companies. Each way will give
different notation for the same function V , and a different way of assigning numbers
to columns of three numbers. Thus, it is critical to make clear which ordering is
used if the reader is to understand what is written. Doing so is a way of organizing
information.
We were free to choose any symbol to denote these orders. We chose B and B 0 because
we are hinting at a central idea in the course: choosing a basis.

12

What is Linear Algebra?
This example is a hint at a much bigger idea central to the text; our choice of
order is an example of choosing a basis3.

The main lesson of an introductory linear algebra course is this: you
have considerable freedom in how you organize information about certain
functions, and you can use that freedom to
1. uncover aspects of functions that don’t change with the choice (Ch 12)
2. make calculations maximally easy (Ch 13 and Ch 17)
3. approximate functions of several variables (Ch 17).
Unfortunately, because the subject (at least for those learning it) requires
seemingly arcane and tedious computations involving large arrays of numbers
known as matrices, the key concepts and the wide applicability of linear
algebra are easily missed. So we reiterate,
Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear functions.
In broad terms, vectors are things you can add and linear functions are
functions of vectors that respect vector addition.

1.2

What are Vectors?

Here are some examples of things that can be added:
Example 2 (Vector Addition)
(A) Numbers: Both 3 and 5 are numbers and so is 3 + 5.
     
1
0
1
(B) 3-vectors: 1 + 1 = 2.

Please note that this is an example of choosing a basis, not a statement of the definition
of the technical term “basis”. You can no more learn the definition of “basis” from this
example than learn the definition of “bird” by seeing a penguin.

1.2 What are Vectors?

13

(C) Polynomials: If p(x) = 1 + x − 2x2 + 3x3 and q(x) = x + 3x2 − 3x3 + x4 then
their sum p(x) + q(x) is the new polynomial 1 + 2x + x2 + x4 .
(D) Power series: If f (x) = 1+x+ 2!1 x2 + 3!1 x3 +· · · and g(x) = 1−x+ 2!1 x2 − 3!1 x3 +· · ·
then f (x) + g(x) = 1 +

1 2
2! x

4! x · · ·

is also a power series.

(E) Functions: If f (x) = ex and g(x) = e−x then their sum f (x) + g(x) is the new
function 2 cosh x.

There are clearly different kinds of vectors. Stacks of numbers are not the
only things that are vectors, as examples C, D, and E show. Vectors of
different kinds can not be added; What possible meaning could the following
have?
 
9
+ ex
3
In fact, you should think of all five kinds of vectors above as different
kinds, and that you should not add vectors that are not of the same kind.
On the other hand, any two things of the same kind “can be added”. This is
the reason you should now start thinking of all the above objects as vectors!
In Chapter 5 we will give the precise rules that vector addition must obey.
In the above examples, however, notice that the vector addition rule stems
from the rules for adding numbers.
When adding the same vector over and over, for example
x + x, x + x + x, x + x + x + x, ... ,
we will write
2x , 3x , 4x , . . . ,
respectively. For example

Defining 4x = x + x + x + x is fine for integer multiples, but does not help us
make sense of 13 x. For the different types of vectors above, you can probably
13

guess how to multiply a vector by a scalar. For example
  1

1 =  3  .
3
0

A very special vector can be produced from any vector of any kind by
scalar multiplying any vector by the number 0. This is called the zero vector
and is usually denoted simply 0. This gives five very different kinds of zero
from the 5 different kinds of vectors in examples A-E above.
(A) 0(3) = 0 (The zero number)
   

(E) 0 (ex ) = 0 (The zero function)
In any given situation that you plan to describe using vectors, you need
to decide on a way to add and scalar multiply vectors. In summary:
Vectors are things you can add and scalar multiply.

Examples of kinds of vectors:
• numbers
• n-vectors
• 2nd order polynomials
• polynomials
• power series
• functions with a certain domain

1.3 What are Linear Functions?

What are Linear Functions?

In calculus classes, the main subject of investigation was the rates of change
of functions. In linear algebra, functions will again be the focus of your
attention, but functions of a very special type. In precalculus you were
perhaps encouraged to think of a function as a machine f into which one
may feed a real number. For each input x this machine outputs a single real
number f (x).

In linear algebra, the functions we study will have vectors (of some type)
as both inputs and outputs. We just saw that vectors are objects that can be
added or scalar multiplied—a very general notion—so the functions we are
going to study will look novel at first. So things don’t get too abstract, here
are five questions that can be rephrased in terms of functions of vectors.
Example 3 (Questions involving Functions of Vectors in Disguise)
(A) What number x satisfies 10x = 3?

(D) What power series f (x) satisfies x dx

The cross product appears in this equation.

16

What is Linear Algebra?
(E) What number x satisfies 4x2 = 1?
All of these are of the form
(?) What vector X satisfies f (X) = B?
with a function5 f known, a vector B known, and a vector X unknown.

The machine needed for part (A) is as in the picture below.

x

10x

This is just like a function f from calculus that takes in a number x and
spits out the number 10x. (You might write f (x) = 10x to indicate this).
For part (B), we need something more sophisticated.



z
 −z  ,
y−x

 
x
y
z

The inputs and outputs are both 3-vectors. The output is the cross product
of the input with... how about you complete this sentence to make sure you
understand.
The machine needed for example (C) looks like it has just one input and
two outputs; we input a polynomial and get a 2-vector as output.
 R1



This example is important because it displays an important feature; the
inputs for this function are functions.

In math terminology, each question is asking for the level set of f corresponding to B.

16

1.3 What are Linear Functions?

17

While this sounds complicated, linear algebra is the study of simple functions of vectors; its time to describe the essential characteristics of linear
functions.
Let’s use the letter L to denote an arbitrary linear function and think
again about vector addition and scalar multiplication. Also, suppose that v
and u are vectors and c is a number. Since L is a function from vectors to
vectors, if we input u into L, the output L(u) will also be some sort of vector.
The same goes for L(v). (And remember, our input and output vectors might
be something other than stacks of numbers!) Because vectors are things that
can be added and scalar multiplied, u + v and cu are also vectors, and so
they can be used as inputs. The essential characteristic of linear functions is
what can be said about L(u + v) and L(cu) in terms of L(u) and L(v).
Before we tell you this essential characteristic, ruminate on this picture.

The “blob” on the left represents all the vectors that you are allowed to
input into the function L, the blob on the right denotes the possible outputs,
and the lines tell you which inputs are turned into which outputs.6 A full
pictorial description of the functions would require all inputs and outputs
6

The domain, codomain, and rule of correspondence of the function are represented by
the left blog, right blob, and arrows, respectively.

17

18

What is Linear Algebra?
and lines to be explicitly drawn, but we are being diagrammatic; we only
drew four of each.
Now think about adding L(u) and L(v) to get yet another vector L(u) +
L(v) or of multiplying L(u) by c to obtain the vector cL(u), and placing both
on the right blob of the picture above. But wait! Are you certain that these
are possible outputs!?
Here’s the answer

The key to the whole class, from which everything else follows:

1. Additivity:
L(u + v) = L(u) + L(v) .

2. Homogeneity:
L(cu) = cL(u) .

Most functions of vectors do not obey this requirement.7 At its heart, linear
algebra is the study of functions that do.
Notice that the additivity requirement says that the function L respects
vector addition: it does not matter if you first add u and v and then input
their sum into L, or first input u and v into L separately and then add the
outputs. The same holds for scalar multiplication–try writing out the scalar
multiplication version of the italicized sentence. When a function of vectors
obeys the additivity and homogeneity properties we say that it is linear (this
is the “linear” of linear algebra). Together, additivity and homogeneity are
called linearity. Are there other, equivalent, names for linear functions? yes.
7

E.g.: If f (x) = x2 then f (1 + 1) = 4 6= f (1) + f (1) = 2. Try any other function you
can think of!

18

1.3 What are Linear Functions?

19

Function = Transformation = Operator
And now for a hint at the power of linear algebra. The questions in
examples (A-D) can all be restated as
Lv = w
where v is an unknown, w a known vector, and L is a known linear transformation. To check that this is true, one needs to know the rules for adding
vectors (both inputs and outputs) and then check linearity of L. Solving the
equation Lv = w often amounts to solving systems of linear equations, the
skill you will learn in Chapter 2.
A great example is the derivative operator.
Example 4 (The derivative operator is linear)
For any two functions f (x), g(x) and any number c, in calculus you probably learnt
that the derivative operator satisfies
1.

d
dx (cf )

2.

d
dx (f

d

f,

+ g) =

d
dx f

+

d
dx g.

If we view functions as vectors with addition given by addition of functions and with
scalar multiplication given by multiplication of functions by constants, then these
familiar properties of derivatives are just the linearity property of linear maps.

Before introducing matrices, notice that for linear maps L we will often
write simply Lu instead of L(u). This is because the linearity property of a
19

20

What is Linear Algebra?
linear transformation L means that L(u) can be thought of as multiplying
the vector u by the linear operator L. For example, the linearity of L implies
that if u, v are vectors and c, d are numbers, then

L(cu + dv) = cLu + dLv ,
which feels a lot like the regular rules of algebra for numbers. Notice though,
that “uL” makes no sense here.
Remark A sum of multiples of vectors cu + dv is called a linear combination of
u and v.

1.4

So, What is a Matrix?

Matrices are linear functions of a certain kind. They appear almost ubiquitously in linear algebra because– and this is the central lesson of introductory
linear algebra courses–
Matrices are the result of organizing information related to linear
functions.
This idea will take some time to develop, but we provided an elementary
example in Section 1.1. A good starting place to learn about matrices is by
studying systems of linear equations.
Example 5 A room contains x bags and y boxes of fruit.

20

1.4 So, What is a Matrix?

21

Each bag contains 2 apples and 4 bananas and each box contains 6 apples and 8
bananas. There are 20 apples and 28 bananas in the room. Find x and y.
The values are the numbers x and y that simultaneously make both of the following
equations true:
2 x + 6 y = 20
4 x + 8 y = 28 .

Here we have an example of a System of Linear Equations.8 It’s a collection
of equations in which variables are multiplied by constants and summed, and
no variables are multiplied together: There are no powers of variables (like x2
or y 5 ), non-integer or negative powers of variables (like y 1/7 or x−3 ), and no
places where variables are multiplied together (like xy).
Reading homework: problem 1
Information about the fruity contents of the room can be stored two ways:
(i) In terms of the number of apples and bananas.
(ii) In terms of the number of bags and boxes.
Intuitively, knowing the information in one form allows you to figure out the
information in the other form. Going from (ii) to (i) is easy: If you knew
there were 3 bags and 2 boxes it would be easy to calculate the number
of apples and bananas, and doing so would have the feel of multiplication
(containers times fruit per container). In the example above we are required
to go the other direction, from (i) to (ii). This feels like the opposite of
multiplication, i.e., division. Matrix notation will make clear what we are
“multiplying” and “dividing” by.
The goal of Chapter 2 is to efficiently solve systems of linear equations.
Partly, this is just a matter of finding a better notation, but one that hints
at a deeper underlying mathematical structure. For that, we need rules for
adding and scalar multiplying 2-vectors;

Perhaps you can see that both lines are of the form Lu = v with u =

through giggles for the possibility of the phrase “two 2-vectors.”

22

1.4 So, What is a Matrix?

23

This is of the same Lv = w form as our opening examples. The matrix
encodes fruit per container. The equation is roughly fruit per container
times number of containers equals fruit. To solve for number of containers
we want to somehow “divide” by the matrix.
Another way to think about the above example is to remember the rule
for multiplying a matrix times a vector. If you have forgotten this, you can
actually guess a good rule by making sure the matrix equation is the same
as the system of linear equations. This would require that

Notice, that the second way of writing the output on the right hand side of
this equation is very useful because it tells us what all possible outputs a
matrix times a vector look like – they are just sums of the columns of the
matrix multiplied by scalars. The set of all possible outputs of a matrix
times a vector is called the column space (it is also the image of the linear
function defined by the matrix).
Reading homework: problem 2
Multiplication by a matrix is an example of a Linear Function, because it
takes one vector and turns it into another in a “linear” way. Of course, we
can have much larger matrices if our system has more variables.

Matrices in Space!

We have come full circle; matrices are just examples of the kinds of linear
operators that appear in algebra problems like those in section 1.3. Any
equation of the form M v = w with M a matrix, and v, w n-vectors is called
a matrix equation. Chapter 2 is about efficiently solving systems of linear
equations, or equivalently matrix equations.

g ◦ f : U −→ W

This is called the composition of functions. Matrix multiplication is the tool
required for computing the composition of linear functions.

1.4.2

The Matrix Detour

Linear algebra is about linear functions, not matrices. The following presentation is meant to get you thinking about this idea constantly throughout
the course.
Matrices only get involved in linear algebra when certain
notational choices are made.
To exemplify, lets look at the derivative operator again.
Example 9 of how matrices come into linear algebra.
Consider the equation


d
+2 f =x+1
dx
where f is unknown (the place where solutions should go) and the linear differential
d
operator dx
+ 2 is understood to take in quadratic functions (of the form ax2 + bx + c)
and give out other quadratic functions.
Let’s simplify the way we denote the quadratic functions; we will
 
a
denote ax2 + bx + c as  b .
c B
The subscript B serves to remind us of our particular notational convention; we will
compare to another notational convention later. With the convention B we can say

That is, our notational convention for quadratic functions has induced a notation for

numbers encodes the vector 12 x+ 41 , which is indeed the solution to our equation since,

d
substituting for f yields the true statement dx
+ 2 ( 12 x + 14 ) = x + 1.

It would be nice to have a systematic way to rewrite any linear equation
as an equivalent matrix equation. It will be a little while before we can learn
to organize information in a way generalizable to all linear equations, but
keep this example in mind throughout the course.
The general idea is presented in the picture below; sometimes a linear
equation is too hard to solve as is, but by organizing information and reformulating the equation as a matrix equation the process of finding solutions
becomes tractable.

A simple example with the knowns (L and V are dx
and 3, respectively) is
shown below, although the detour is unnecessary in this case since you know
how to anti-differentiate.

To drive home the point that we are not studying matrices but rather linear functions, and that those linear functions can be represented as matrices
under certain notational conventions, consider how changeable the notational
conventions are.

One linear function can be represented (denoted) by a huge variety of
matrices. The representation only depends on how vectors are denoted as
n-vectors.

is the (preferred) axis of rotation. Upon applying a force F on an object

you put something else in. Show that it is unique. Can you write
this operator as a matrix?

conclusion. In mathspeak–proof by contradiction.

no ordering; {∗, ?, #} = {#, ?, ∗} etc. (In fact the same is true for

codomain element to each element of the domain.)

function from part (i) as a triple of numbers.

Systems of Linear Equations

2.1

Gaussian Elimination

Systems of linear equations can be written as matrix equations. Now you
will learn an efficient algorithm for (maximally) simplifying a system of linear
equations (or a matrix equation) – Gaussian elimination.

2.1.1

Augmented Matrix Notation

Efficiency demands a new notation, called an augmented matrix , which we
introduce via examples:
The linear system

Again, we are trying to find which combination of the columns of the matrix
adds up to the vector on the right hand side.
For the the general case of r linear equations in k unknowns, the number
of equations is the number of rows r in the augmented matrix, and the
number of columns k in the matrix left of the vertical line is the number of
unknowns, giving an augmented matrix of the form

denote exponents. Make sure you can write out the system of equations and
the associated matrix equation for any augmented matrix.

We now have three ways of writing the same question. Let’s put them
side by side as we solve the system by strategically adding and subtracting
equations. We will not tell you the motivation for this particular series of
steps yet, but let you develop some intuition first.

Did you see what the strategy was? To eliminate y from the first equation
and then eliminate x from the second. The result was the solution to the
system.
Here is the big idea: Everywhere in the instructions above we can replace
the word “equation” with the word “row” and interpret them as telling us
what to do with the augmented matrix instead of the system of equations.
Performed systemically, the result is the Gaussian elimination algorithm.

2.1.2

Equivalence and the Act of Solving

We now introduce the symbol ∼ which is called “tilde” but should be read as
“is (row) equivalent to” because at each step the augmented matrix changes
by an operation on its rows but its solutions do not. For example, we found
above that

Equivalence Example
Setting up a string of equivalences like this is a means of solving a system
of linear equations. This is the main idea of section 2.1.3. This next example
hints at the main trick:

Note that in going from the first to second augmented matrix, we used the top left 1
to make the bottom left entry zero. For this reason we call the top left entry a pivot.
Similarly, to get from the second to third augmented matrix, the bottom right entry
(before the divide) was used to make the top right one vanish; so the bottom right
entry is also called a pivot.

This name pivot is used to indicate the matrix entry used to “zero out”
the other entries in its column; the pivot is the number used to eliminate
another number in its column.

2.1.3

Reduced Row Echelon Form

For a system of two linear equations, the goal of Gaussian elimination is to
convert the part of the augmented matrix left of the dividing line into the
matrix

called the Identity Matrix , since this would give the simple statement of a
solution x = a, y = b. The same goes for larger systems of equations for
which the identity matrix I has 1’s along its diagonal and all off-diagonal
entries vanish:

Reading homework: problem 2
For many systems, it is not possible to reach the identity in the augmented
matrix via Gaussian elimination. In any case, a certain version of the matrix
that has the maximum number of components eliminated is said to be the
Row Reduced Echelon Form (RREF).
Example 13 (Redundant equations)

(
⇔

x + y = 2
0 + 0 = 0

This example demonstrates if one equation is a multiple of the other the identity
matrix can not be a reached. This is because the first step in elimination will make
the second row a row of zeros. Notice that solutions still exists (1, 1) is a solution.
The last augmented matrix here is in RREF; no more than two components can be
eliminated.

This system of equation has a solution if there exists two numbers x, and y such that
0 + 0 = 1. That is a tricky way of saying there are no solutions. The last form of the
augmented matrix here is the RREF.

and then give up because the the upper left slot can not function as a pivot since the 0

0 + y = −2 .
The third augmented matrix above is the RREF of the first and second. That is to
say, you can swap rows on your way to RREF.

For larger systems of equations redundancy and inconsistency are the obstructions to obtaining the identity matrix, and hence to a simple statement
of a solution in the form x = a, y = b, . . . . What can we do to maximally
simplify a system of equations in general? We need to perform operations
that simplify our system without changing its solutions. Because, exchanging
the order of equations, multiplying one equation by a non-zero constant or
adding equations does not change the system’s solutions, we are lead to three
operations:
• (Row Swap) Exchange any two rows.
• (Scalar Multiplication) Multiply any row by a non-zero constant.
• (Row Addition) Add one row to another row.
These are called Elementary Row Operations, or EROs for short, and are
studied in detail in section 2.3. Suppose now we have a general augmented
matrix for which the first entry in the first row does not vanish. Then, using
just the three EROs, we could1 then perform the following.

1

This is a “brute force” algorithm; there will often be more efficient ways to get to
RREF.

42

2.1 Gaussian Elimination

43

Algorithm For Obtaining RREF:
• Make the leftmost nonzero entry in the top row 1 by multiplication.
• Then use that 1 as a pivot to eliminate everything below it.
• Then go to the next row and make the leftmost nonzero entry 1.
• Use that 1 as a pivot to eliminate everything below and above it!
• Go to the next row and make the leftmost nonzero entry 1... etc
In the case that the first entry of the first row is zero, we may first interchange
the first row with another row whose first entry is non-vanishing and then
perform the above algorithm. If the entire first column vanishes, we may still
apply the algorithm on the remaining columns.
Here is a video (with special effects!) of a hand performing the algorithm
by hand. When it is done, you should try doing what it does.

Beginner Elimination
This algorithm and its variations is known as Gaussian elimination. The
endpoint of the algorithm is an augmented matrix of the form

linear algebra; it will be the primary means of computation for this course.
You need to learn it well. So start practicing as soon as you can, and practice

1. In every row the left most non-zero entry is 1 (and is called a pivot).
2. The pivot of any given row is always to the right of the pivot of the
row above it.
3. The pivot is the only non-zero entry in its column.
Example 16 (Augmented matrix in RREF)

1 0 7
0 1 3



0 2 0

1 0 1
0 0 1

Actually, this NON-example breaks all three of the rules!

The reason we need the asterisks in the general form of RREF is that
not every column need have a pivot, as demonstrated in examples 13 and 16.
Here is an example where multiple columns have no pivot:

⇔
w = 0.
Note that there was no hope of reaching the identity matrix, because of the shape of
the augmented matrix we started with.

With some practice, elimination can go quickly. Here is an expert showing
you some tricks. If you can’t follow him now then come back when you have
some more experience and watch again. You are going to need to get really
good at this!

Advanced Elimination
It is important that you are able to convert RREF back into a system
of equations. The first thing you might notice is that if any of the numbers
bk+1 , . . . , br in 2.1.3 are non-zero then the system of equations is inconsistent
and has no solutions. Our next task is to extract all possible solutions from
an RREF augmented matrix.

2.1.4

Solution Sets and RREF

RREF is a maximally simplified version of the original system of equations
in the following sense:
• As many coefficients of the variables as possible are 0.
• As many coefficients of the variables as possible are 1.
It is easier to read off solutions from the maximally simplified equations than
from the original equations, even when there are infinitely many solutions.

Systems of Linear Equations
Here is a verbal description of the preceeding example of the standard approach. We say that x, y, and z are pivot variables because they appeared
with a pivot coefficient in RREF. Since w never appears with a pivot coefficient, it is not a pivot variable. In the second line we put all the pivot
variables on one side and all the non-pivot variables on the other side and
added the trivial equation w = w to obtain a system that allowed us to easily
read off solutions.

The Standard Approach To Solution Sets
1. Write the augmented matrix.
2. Perform EROs to reach RREF.
3. Express the pivot variables in terms of the non-pivot variables.

There are always exactly enough non-pivot variables to index your solutions.
In any approach, the variables which are not expressed in terms of the other
variables are called free variables. The standard approach is to use the nonpivot variables as free variables.
Non-standard approach: solve for w in terms of z and substitute into the
other equations. You now have an expression for each component in terms
of z. But why pick z instead of y or x? (or x + y?) The standard approach
not only feels natural, but is canonical, meaning that everyone will get the
same RREF and hence choose the same variables to be free. However, it is
important to remember that so long as their set of solutions is the same, any
two choices of free variables is fine. (You might think of this as the difference
between using Google MapsTM or MapquestTM ; although their maps may
look different, the place hhome sici they are describing is the same!)
When you see an RREF augmented matrix with two columns that have
no pivot, you know there will be two free variables.

From RREF to a Solution Set
You can imagine having three, four, or fifty-six non-pivot columns and
the same number of free variables indexing your solutions set. In general a
solution set to a system of equations with n free variables will be of the form
H
H
{xP + µ1 xH
1 + µ2 x2 + · · · + µn xn : µ1 , . . . , µn ∈ R}.

The parts of these solutions play special roles in the associated matrix
equation. This will come up again and again long after we complete this
discussion of basic calculation methods, so we will use the general language
of linear algebra to give names to these parts now.
Definition: A homogeneous solution to a linear equation Lx = v, with
L and v known is a vector xH such that LxH = 0 where 0 is the zero vector.
If you have a particular solution xP to a linear equation and add
a sum of multiples of homogeneous solutions to it you obtain another
particular solution.

47

48

Systems of Linear Equations

Particular and Homogeneous Solutions
Check now that the parts of the solutions with free variables as coefficients
from the previous examples are homogeneous solutions, and that by adding
a homogeneous solution to a particular solution one obtains a solution to the
matrix equation. This will come up over and over again. As an example
d2
without matrices, consider the differential equation dx
2 f = 3. A particular
solution is 23 x2 while x and 1 are homogeneous solutions. The solution set is
{ 32 x2 + ax + c1 : a, b ∈ R}. You can imagine similar differential equations
with more homogeneous solutions.
You need to become very adept at reading off solutions sets of linear
systems from the RREF of their augmented matrix; it is a basic skill for
linear algebra, and we will continue using it up to the last page of the book!

7. Another method for solving linear systems is to use row operations to
bring the augmented matrix to Row Echelon Form (REF as opposed to
RREF). In REF, the pivots are not necessarily set to one, and we only
require that all entries left of the pivots are zero, not necessarily entries
above a pivot. Provide a counterexample to show that row echelon form
is not unique.
Once a system is in row echelon form, it can be solved by “back substitution.” Write the following row echelon matrix as a system of equations, then solve the system using back-substitution.

• Transitive: For any x, y and z ∈ U , if x ∼ y and y ∼ z then x ∼ z.
Show that row equivalence of matrices is an example of an equivalence
relation.

Here we have multiplied the augmented matrix with the matrices that acted on rows
listed on the right of example 21.

Realizing EROs as matrices allows us to give a concrete notion of “dividing by a matrix”; we can now perform manipulations on both sides of an
equation in a familiar way:

Example 23 (Undoing A in Ax = b slowly, for A = 6 = 3 · 2)

This is another way of thinking about Gaussian elimination which feels more
like elementary algebra in the sense that you “do something to both sides of
an equation” until you have a solution.

2.3.2

Recording EROs in (M |I )

Just as we put together 3−1 2−1 = 6−1 to get a single thing to apply to both
sides of 6x = 12 to undo 6, we should put together multiple EROs to get
a single thing that undoes our matrix. To do this, augment by the identity
matrix (not just a single column) and then perform Gaussian elimination.
There is no need to write the EROs as systems of equations or as matrices
while doing this.

Whenever the product of two matrices M N = I, we say that N is the
inverse of M or N = M −1 . Conversely M is the inverse of N ; M = N −1 .
In abstract generality, let M be some matrix and, as always, let I stand
for the identity matrix. Imagine the process of performing elementary row
operations to bring M to the identity matrix:
(M |I) ∼ (E1 M |E1 ) ∼ (E2 E1 M |E2 E1 ) ∼ · · · ∼ (I| · · · E2 E1 ) .
The ellipses “· · · ” stand for additional EROs. The result is a product of
matrices that form a matrix which undoes M
· · · E2 E1 M = I .
This is only true if the RREF of M is the identity matrix.
Definition: A matrix M is invertible if its RREF is an identity matrix.
55

56

Systems of Linear Equations

How to find M −1
(M |I) ∼ (I|M −1 )
Much use is made of the fact that invertible matrices can be undone with
EROs. To begin with, since each elementary row operation has an inverse,
M = E1−1 E2−1 · · · ,
while the inverse of M is
M −1 = · · · E2 E1 .
This is symbolically verified by
M −1 M = · · · E2 E1 E1−1 E2−1 · · · = · · · E2 E2−1 · · · = · · · = I .
Thus, if M is invertible, then M can be expressed as the product of EROs.
(The same is true for its inverse.) This has the feel of the fundamental
theorem of arithmetic (integers can be expressed as the product of primes)
or the fundamental theorem of algebra (polynomials can be expressed as the
product of [complex] first order polynomials); EROs are building blocks of
invertible matrices.

2.3.3

The Three Elementary Matrices

We now work toward concrete examples and applications. It is surprisingly
easy to translate between EROs and matrices that perform EROs. The
matrices corresponding to these kinds are close in form to the identity matrix:

LU , LDU , and P LDU Factorizations

The process of elimination can be stopped halfway to obtain decompositions
frequently used in large computations in sciences and engineering. The first
half of the elimination process is to eliminate entries below the diagonal
leaving a matrix which is called upper triangular. The elementary matrices
which perform this part of the elimination are lower triangular, as are their
inverses. But putting together the upper triangular and lower triangular
parts one obtains the so-called LU factorization.

What if we stop at a different point in elimination? We could multiply
rows so that the entries in the diagonal are 1 next. Note that the EROs that
do this are diagonal. This gives a slightly different factorization.

2.4 Review Problems

The LDU factorization of a matrix is a factorization into blocks of EROs
of a various types: L is the product of the inverses of EROs which eliminate
below the diagonal by row addition, D the product of inverses of EROs which
set the diagonal elements to 1 by row multiplication, and U is the product
of inverses of EROs which eliminate above the diagonal by row addition.
You may notice that one of the three kinds of row operation is missing
from this story. Row exchange may be necessary to obtain RREF. Indeed, so
far in this chapter we have been working under the tacit assumption that M
can be brought to the identity by just row multiplication and row addition.
If row exchange is necessary, the resulting factorization is LDP U where P is
the product of inverses of EROs that perform row exchange.

7. Is LU factorization of a matrix unique? Justify your answer.
∞. If you randomly create a matrix by picking numbers out of the blue,
it will probably be difficult to perform elimination or factorization;
fractions and large numbers will probably be involved. To invent simple
problems it is better to start with a simple answer:
(a) Start with any augmented matrix in RREF. Perform EROs to
make most of the components non-zero. Write the result on a
separate piece of paper and give it to your friend. Ask that friend
to find RREF of the augmented matrix you gave them. Make sure
they get the same augmented matrix you started with.
(b) Create an upper triangular matrix U and a lower triangular matrix L with only 1s on the diagonal. Give the result to a friend to
factor into LU form.
(c) Do the same with an LDU factorization.

Solution Sets for Systems of Linear Equations

Algebraic equations problems can have multiple solutions. For example x(x−
1) = 0 has two solutions: 0 and 1. By contrast, equations of the form Ax = b
with A a linear operator (with scalars the real numbers) have the following
property:
If A is a linear operator and b is known, then Ax = b has either
1. One solution

The Geometry of Solution Sets: Hyperplanes

Consider the following algebra problems and their solutions.
1. 6x = 12 has one solution: 2.
2a. 0x = 12 has no solution.
2b. 0x = 0 has infinitely many solutions; its solution set is R.
In each case the linear operator is a 1 × 1 matrix. In the first case, the linear
operator is invertible. In the other two cases it is not. In the first case, the
solution set is a point on the number line, in case 2b the solution set is the
whole number line.
Lets examine similar situations with larger matrices: 2 × 2 matrices.

Again, in the first case the linear operator is invertible while in the other
cases it is not. When a 2 × 2 matrix from a matrix equation is not invertible
the solution set can be empty, a line in the plane, or the plane itself.
For a system of equations with r equations and k veriables, one can have a
number of different outcomes. For example, consider the case of r equations
in three variables. Each of these equations is the equation of a plane in threedimensional space. To find solutions to the system of equations, we look for
the common intersection of the planes (if an intersection exists). Here we
have five different possibilities:
64

2.5 Solution Sets for Systems of Linear Equations
1. Unique Solution. The planes have a unique point of intersection.
2a. No solutions. Some of the equations are contradictory, so no solutions
exist.
2bi. Line. The planes intersect in a common line; any point on that line
then gives a solution to the system of equations.
2bii. Plane. Perhaps you only had one equation to begin with, or else all
of the equations coincide geometrically. In this case, you have a plane
of solutions, with two free parameters.

Planes
2biii. All of R3 . If you start with no information, then any point in R3 is a
solution. There are three free parameters.
In general, for systems of equations with k unknowns, there are k + 2
possible outcomes, corresponding to the possible numbers (i.e., 0, 1, 2, . . . , k)
of free parameters in the solutions set, plus the possibility of no solutions.
These types of solution sets are hyperplanes, generalizations of planes that
behave like planes in R3 in many ways.

Particular Solution + Homogeneous Solutions

Lets look at solution sets again, this time trying to get to their geometric
shape. In the standard approach, variables corresponding to columns that
do not contain a pivot (after going to reduced row echelon form) are free. It
is the number of free variables that determines the geometry of the solution
set.

for any µ1 , µ2 ∈ R. Choosing µ1 = µ2 = 0, we obtain
M xP = v .
This is why xP is an example of a particular solution.
Setting µ1 = 1, µ2 = 0, and subtracting M xP = v we obtain
M xH

Likewise, setting µ1 = 0, µ2 = 1, we obtain
M xH

Here xH

the system. They do not solve the original equation M x = v, but instead its
associated homogeneous equation M y = 0.
We have just learnt a fundamental lesson of linear algebra: the solution
set to Ax = b, where A is a linear operator, consists of a particular solution
plus homogeneous solutions.

The Simplex Method

In Chapter 2, you learned how to handle systems of linear equations. However
there are many situations in which inequalities appear instead of equalities.
In such cases we are often interested in an optimal solution extremizing a
particular quantity of interest. Questions like this are a focus of fields such as
mathematical optimization and operations research. For the case where the
functions involved are linear, these problems go under the title linear programming. Originally these ideas were driven by military applications, but
by now are ubiquitous in science and industry. Gigantic computers are dedicated to implementing linear programming methods such as George Dantzig’s
simplex algorithm–the topic of this chapter.

3.1

Pablo’s Problem

Let us begin with an example. Consider again Pablo the nutritionist of
problem 5, chapter 1. The Conundrum City school board has employed
Pablo to design their school lunch program. Unfortunately for Pablo, their
requirements are rather tricky:
Example 34 (Pablo’s problem)
The Conundrum City school board is heavily influenced by the local fruit grower’s
association. They have stipulated that children eat at least 7 oranges and 5 apples
per week. Parents and teachers have agreed that eating at least 15 pieces of fruit per
week is a good thing, but school janitors argue that too much fruit makes a terrible
mess, so that children should eat no more than 25 pieces of fruit per week.

71

72

The Simplex Method

Finally Pablo knows that oranges have twice as much sugar as apples and that apples
have 5 grams of sugar each. Too much sugar is unhealthy, so Pablo wants to keep the
children’s sugar intake as low as possible. How many oranges and apples should Pablo
suggest that the school board put on the menu?

This is a rather gnarly word problem. Our first step is to restate it as
mathematics, stripping away all the extraneous information:
Example 35 (Pablo’s problem restated)
Let x be the number of apples and y be the number of oranges. These must obey
x≥5

and y ≥ 7 ,

to fulfill the school board’s politically motivated wishes. The teacher’s and parent’s
fruit requirement means that
x + y ≥ 15 ,
but to keep the canteen tidy
x + y ≤ 25 .
Now let
s = 5x + 10y .
This linear function of (x, y) represents the grams of sugar in x apples and y oranges.
The problem is asking us to minimize s subject to the four linear inequalities listed
above.

72

3.2 Graphical Solutions

Graphical Solutions

Before giving a more general algorithm for handling this problem and problems like it, we note that when the number of variables is small (preferably 2),
a graphical technique can be used.
Inequalities, such as the four given in Pablo’s problem, are often called
constraints, and values of the variables that satisfy these constraints comprise
the so-called feasible region. Since there are only two variables, this is easy
to plot:
Example 36 (Constraints and feasible region) Pablo’s constraints are
x≥5
y≥7
15 ≤ x + y ≤ 25 .
Plotted in the (x, y) plane, this gives:

You might be able to see the solution to Pablo’s problem already. Oranges
are very sugary, so they should be kept low, thus y = 7. Also, the less fruit
the better, so the answer had better lie on the line x + y = 15. Hence,
the answer must be at the vertex (8, 7). Actually this is a general feature
73

74

The Simplex Method
of linear programming problems, the optimal answer must lie at a vertex of
the feasible region. Rather than prove this, lets look at a plot of the linear
function s(x, y) = 5x + 10y.

Example 37 (The sugar function)
Plotting the sugar function requires three dimensions:

The plot of a linear function of two variables is a plane through the origin.
Restricting the variables to the feasible region gives some lamina in 3-space.
Since the function we want to optimize is linear (and assumedly non-zero), if
we pick a point in the middle of this lamina, we can always increase/decrease
the function by moving out to an edge and, in turn, along that edge to a
corner. Applying this to the above picture, we see that Pablo’s best option
is 110 grams of sugar a week, in the form of 8 apples and 7 oranges.
It is worthwhile to contrast the optimization problem for a linear function
with the non-linear case you may have seen in calculus courses:
74

3.3 Dantzig’s Algorithm

75

Here we have plotted the curve f (x) = d in the case where the function f is
linear and non-linear. To optimize f in the interval [a, b], for the linear case
we just need to compute and compare the values f (a) and f (b). In contrast,
for non-linear functions it is necessary to also compute the derivative df /dx
to study whether there are extrema inside the interval.

3.3

Dantzig’s Algorithm

In simple situations a graphical method might suffice, but in many applications there may be thousands or even millions of variables and constraints.
Clearly an algorithm that can be implemented on a computer is needed. The
simplex algorithm (usually attributed to George Dantzig) provides exactly
that. It begins with a standard problem:
Problem 38 Maximize f (x1 , . . . , xn ) where f is linear, xi ≥ 0 (i = 1, . . . , n) subject to


x1


Mx = v ,
x :=  ...  ,
xn
where the m × n matrix M and m × 1 column vector v are given.

This is solved by arranging the information in an augmented matrix and
then applying EROs. To see how this works lets try an example.

75

76

The Simplex Method
Example 39 Maximize f (x, y, z, w) = 3x − 3y − z + 4w subject to constraints
c1 :=

x+y+z+w

= 5

c2 := x + 2y + 3z + 2w = 6 ,
where x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0 and w ≥ 0.

The key observation is this: Suppose we are trying to maximize f (x1 , . . . , xn )
subject to a constraint c(x1 , . . . , xn ) = k for some constant k (c and k would
be the entries of M x and v, respectively, in the above). Then we can also
try to maximize
f (x1 , . . . , xn ) + αc(x1 , . . . , xn )
because this is only a constant shift f → f + αk. Choosing α carefully can
lead to a simple form for the function we are extremizing.
Example 40 (Setting up an augmented matrix):
Since we are interested in the optimum value of f , we treat it as an additional
variable and add one further equation
−3x + 3y + z − 4w + f = 0 .
We arrange this equation and the two constraints in an augmented matrix


.

Keep in mind that the first four columns correspond to the positive variables (x, y, z, w)
and that the last row has the information of the function f . The general case is depicted
in figure 3.1.

Now the system is written as an augmented matrix where the last row
encodes the objective function and the other rows the constraints. Clearly we
can perform row operations on the constraint rows since this will not change
the solutions to the constraints. Moreover, we can add any amount of the
constraint rows to the last row, since this just amounts to adding a constant
to the function we want to extremize.

Figure 3.1: Arranging the information of an optimization problem in an

Example 41 (Performing EROs)
We scan the last row, and notice the (most negative) coefficient −4. Naı̈vely you
might think that this is good because this multiplies the positive variable w and only
helps the objective function f = 4w + · · · . However, what this actually means is
that the variable w will be positive and thus determined by the constraints. Therefore
we want to remove it from the objective function. We can zero out this entry by
performing a row operation. For that, either of the first two rows could be used.
To decide which, we remember that we still have to solve solve the constraints for
variables that are positive. Hence we should try to keep the first two entries in the
last column positive. Hence we choose the row which will add the smallest constant
to f when we zero out the −4: Look at the last column (where the values of the
constraints are stored). We see that adding four times the first row to the last row
would zero out the −4 entry but add 20 to f , while adding two times the second row
to the last row would also zero out the −4 but only add 12 to f . (You can follow this
by watching what happens to the last entry in the last row.) So we perform the latter
row operation and obtain the following:


1 1 1 1 0
5
c1 = 5


 1 2 3 2 0
6 
c2 = 6
f = 12 + x − 7y − 7z .
−1 7 7 0 1 12
We do not want to undo any of our good work when we perform further row operations,
so now we use the second row to zero out all other entries in the fourth column. This
is achieved by subtracting half the second row from the first:


1

c1 − 21 c2 = 2

c2 = 6
f = 12 + x − 7y − 7z .
−1 7
7 0 1 12

77

78

The Simplex Method
Precisely because we chose the second row to perform our row operations, all entries
in the last column remain positive. This allows us to continue the algorithm.
We now repeat the above procedure: There is a −1 in the first column of the last
row. We want to zero it out while adding as little to f as possible. This is achieved
by adding twice the first row to the last row:



c1 − 21 c2 = 2

c2 = 6
f = 16 − 7y − 6z .
0 7
6 0 1 16
The Dantzig algorithm terminates if all the coefficients in the last row (save perhaps
for the last entry which encodes the value of the objective) are positive. To see why
we are done, lets write out what our row operations have done in terms of the function
f and the constraints (c1 , c2 ). First we have
f = 16 − 7y − 6z
with both y and z positive. Hence to maximize f we should choose y = 0 = z. In
which case we obtain our optimum value
f = 16 .
Finally, we check that the constraints can be solved with y = 0 = z and positive
(x, w). Indeed, they can by taking x = 4, w = 1.

3.4

Pablo Meets Dantzig

Oftentimes, it takes a few tricks to bring a given problem into the standard
form of example 39. In Pablo’s case, this goes as follows.
Example 42 Pablo’s variables x and y do not obey xi ≥ 0. Therefore define new
variables
x1 = x − 5 , x2 = y − 7 .
The conditions on the fruit 15 ≤ x + y ≤ 25 are inequalities,
x1 + x2 ≥ 3 ,

x1 + x2 ≤ 13 ,

so are not of the form M x = v. To achieve this we introduce two new positive
variables x3 ≥ 0, x4 ≥ 4 and write
c1 := x1 + x2 − x3 = 3 ,

78

c2 := x1 + x2 + x4 = 13 .

3.4 Pablo Meets Dantzig

79

These are called slack variables because they take up the “slack” required to convert
inequality to equality. This pair of equations can now be written as M x = v,
 

 x1
 

1 1 −1 0 
x2  = 3 .
1 1 0 1 x3 
13
x4
Finally, Pablo wants to minimize sugar s = 5x + 10y, but the standard problem
maximizes f . Thus the so-called objective function f = −s + 95 = −5x1 − 10x2 .
(Notice that it makes no difference whether we maximize −s or −s + 95, we choose
the latter since it is a linear function of (x1 , x2 ).) Now we can build an augmented
matrix whose last row reflects the objective function equation 5x1 + 10x2 + f = 0:


1 1 −1 0 0 3
 1 1
0 1 0 13  .
5 10
0 0 1 0
Here it seems that the simplex algorithm already terminates because the last row only
has positive coefficients, so that setting x1 = 0 = x2 would be optimal. However, this
does not solve the constraints (for positive values of the slack variables x3 and x4 ).
Thus one more (very dirty) trick is needed. We add two more, positive, (so-called)
artificial variables x5 and x6 to the problem which we use to shift each constraint
c1 → c1 − x5 ,

c2 → c2 − x6 .

The idea being that for large positive α, the modified objective function
f − αx5 − αx6
is only maximal when the artificial variables vanish so the underlying problem is unchanged. Lets take α = 10 (our solution will not depend on this choice) so that our
augmented matrix reads


Now the variables (x2 , x3 , x5 , x6 ) have zero coefficients so must be set to zero to
maximize f . The optimum value is f = −15 so s = −f + 95 = 110 exactly as before.
Finally, to solve the constraints x1 = 3 and x4 = 10 so that x = 8 and y = 7 which
also agrees with our previous result.

Clearly, performed by hand, the simplex algorithm was slow and complex
for Pablo’s problem. However, the key point is that it is an algorithm that
can be fed to a computer. For problems with many variables, this method is
much faster than simply checking all vertices as we did in section 3.2.

quality of oil from well A is better than from well B, so is worth 50%
more per barrel. The Greasy government cares about the environment
and will not allow Conoil to pump in total more than 6 million barrels
per year. Well A costs twice as much as well B to operate. Conoil’s
yearly operating budget is only sufficient to pump at most 10 million
barrels from well B per year. Using both a graphical method and then
(as a double check) Dantzig’s algorithm, determine how many barrels
Conoil should pump from each well to maximize their profits.

Vectors in Rn are impossible to visualize unless n is 1,2, or 3. However,
familiar objects like lines and planes still make sense for any value of n: The

Given two non-zero vectors u, v, they will usually determine a plane,

unless both vectors are in the same line, in which case, one of the vectors
is a scalar multiple of the other. The sum of u and v corresponds to laying
the two vectors head-to-tail and drawing the connecting vector. If u and v
determine a plane, then their sum lies in the plane determined by u and v.

You might sometimes encounter the word “hyperplane” without the qualifier “k-dimensional. When the dimension k is not specified, one usually assumes that k = n − 1 for a hyperplane inside Rn . This is the kind of object
that is specified by one algebraic equation in n variables.

Consider the Euclidean length of an n-vector:

kvk :=

p

v
u n
uX
(v 1 )2 + (v 2 )2 + · · · + (v n )2 = t (v i )2 .
i=1

Using the Law of Cosines, we can then figure out the angle between two
vectors. Given two vectors v and u that span a plane in Rn , we can then
connect the ends of v and u with the vector v − u.
88

4.3 Directions and Magnitudes

89

Then the Law of Cosines states that:
kv − uk2 = kuk2 + kvk2 − 2kuk kvk cos θ
Then isolate cos θ:

kv − uk2 − kuk2 − kvk2 = (v 1 − u1 )2 + · · · + (v n − un )2

− (u1 )2 + · · · + (un )2

− (v 1 )2 + · · · + (v n )2
= −2u1 v 1 − · · · − 2un v n
Thus,
kuk kvk cos θ = u1 v 1 + · · · + un v n .
Note that in the above discussion, we have assumed (correctly) that Euclidean lengths in Rn give the usual notion of lengths of vectors for any plane
in Rn . This now motivates the definition of the dot product.

Notice that the zero vector 0n from Rn is orthogonal to every vector in Rn ;
0n · v = 0 for all v ∈ Rn .
The dot product has some important properties; it is
1. symmetric:
u v = v u,
2. Distributive:
u (v + w) = u v + u w ,
3. Bilinear (which is to say, linear in both u and v):
u (cv + dw) = c u v + d u w ,
and
(cu + dw) v = c u v + d w v .
4. Positive Definite:
u u ≥ 0,
and u u = 0 only when u itself is the 0-vector.
There are, in fact, many different useful ways to define lengths of vectors.
Notice in the definition above that we first defined the dot product, and then
defined everything else in terms of the dot product. So if we change our idea
of the dot product, we change our notion of length and angle as well. The
dot product determines the Euclidean length and angle between two vectors.
Other definitions of length and angle arise from inner products, which
have all of the properties listed above (except that in some contexts the
positive definite requirement is relaxed). Instead of writing for other inner
products, we usually write hu, vi to avoid confusion.

Example 53 Consider a four-dimensional space, with a special direction which we will
call “time”. The Lorentzian inner product on R4 is given by hu, vi = u1 v 1 + u2 v 2 +
u3 v 3 − u4 v 4 . This is of central importance in Einstein’s theory of special relativity.
Note, in particular, that it is not positive definite. As a result, the “squared-length”
of a vector with coordinates x, y, z and t is kvk2 = x2 + y 2 + z 2 − t2 . Notice that
it is possible for kvk2 ≤ 0 even with non-vanishing v! The physical interpretation of
this inner product depends on the sign of the inner product; two space time points
X1 := (x1 , y1 , z1 , t1 ), X2 := (x2 , y2 , z2 , t2 ) are
p
• separated by a distance hX1 , X2 i if hX1 , X2 i ≥ 0.
• separated by a time

p
−hX1 , X2 i if hX1 , X2 i ≤ 0.

In particular, the difference in time coordinates t2 − t1 is not the time between the
two points! (Compare this to using polar coordinates for which the distance between
two points (r, θ1 ) and (r, θ2 ) is not θ2 − θ1 ; coordinate differences are not necessarily
distances.)

Theorem 4.3.1 (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality). For any non-zero vectors u
and v with an inner-product h , i
|hu, vi|
≤ 1.
kuk kvk
The easiest proof would use the definition of the angle between two vectors
and the fact that cos θ ≤ 1. However, strictly speaking speaking we did
not check our assumption that we could apply the Law of Cosines to the
Euclidean length in Rn . There is, however a simple algebraic proof.
Proof. Let α be any real number and consider the following positive, quadratic
polynomial in α
0 ≤ hu + αv, u + αvi = hu, ui + 2αhu, vi + α2 hv, vi .

Since any quadratic aα2 +2bα+c takes its minimal value c− ba when α = − 2a

and the inequality should hold for even this minimum value of the polynomial

ku + vk ≤ kuk + kvk.
Proof.

u u + 2u v + v v
kuk2 + kvk2 + 2 kuk kvk cos θ
(kuk + kvk)2 + 2 kuk kvk(cos θ − 1)
(kuk + kvk)2 .

That is, the square of the left-hand side of the triangle inequality is ≤ the
square of the right-hand side. Since both the things being squared are positive, the inequality holds without the square;
ku + vk ≤ kuk + kvk

The triangle inequality is also “self-evident” when examining a sketch of
u, v and u + v.

Vectors, Lists and Functions: RS

If you were going shopping you might make something like the following list.

We could represent this information mathematically as a set,
S = {apple, orange, onion, milk, carrot} .
94

4.4 Vectors, Lists and Functions: RS

95

There is no information of ordering here and no information about how many
carrots you will buy. This set by itself is not a vector; how would we add
such sets to one another?
If you were a more careful shopper your list might look like the following.

What you have really done here is assign a number to each element of the
set S. In other words, the second list is a function
f : S −→ R .
Given two lists like the second one above, we could easily add them – if you
plan to buy 5 apples and I am buying 3 apples, together we will buy 8 apples!
In fact, the second list is really a 5-vector in disguise.
In general it is helpful to think of an n-vector as a function whose domain
is the set {1, . . . , n}. This is equivalent to thinking of an n-vector as an
ordered list of n numbers. These two ideas give us two equivalent notions for
the set of all n-vectors:
 

1


a


 ..  1
n
n
R :=  .  a , . . . , a ∈ R = {a : {1, . . . , n} → R} =: R{1,··· ,n}


 an

The notation R{1,··· ,n} is used to denote the set of all functions from {1, . . . , n}
to R.
Similarly, for any set S the notation RS denotes the set of functions from
S to R:
RS := {f : S → R} .
When S is an ordered set like {1, . . . , n}, it is natural to write the components
in order. When the elements of S do not have a natural ordering, doing so
might cause confusion.
95

96

Vectors in Space, n-Vectors
Example 55 Consider the set S = {∗, ?, #} from chapter 1 review problem 9. A
particular element of RS is the function a explicitly defined by
a? = 3, a# = 5, a∗ = −2.
It is not natural to write



 
3
−2
a =  5 or a =  3
−2
5
because the elements of S do not have an ordering, since as sets {∗, ?, #} = {?, #, ∗}.

In this important way, RS seems different from R3 . What is more evident
are the similarities; since we can add two functions, we can add two elements
of RS :
Example 56 Addition in R{∗,?,#}
If a, b ∈ R{∗,?,#} such that
a? = 3, a# = 5, a∗ = −2
and
b? = −2, b# = 4, b∗ = 13
then a + b ∈ RS is the function such that
(a + b)? = 3 − 2 = 1, (a + b)# = 5 + 4 = 9, (a + b)∗ = −2 + 13 = 11 .

Also, since we can multiply functions by numbers, there is a notion of
scalar multiplication on RS .
Example 57 Scalar Multiplication in RS
If a ∈ R{∗,?,#} such that
a? = 3, a# = 5, a∗ = −2
then 3a ∈ R{∗,?,#} is the function such that
(3a)? = 3 · 3 = 9, (3a)# = 3 · 5 = 15, (3a)∗ = 3(−2) = −6 .

We visualize R2 and R3 in terms of axes. We have a more abstract picture
of R4 , R5 and Rn for larger n while RS seems even more abstract. However,
when thought of as a simple “shopping list”, you can see that vectors in RS
in fact, can describe everyday objects. In chapter 5 we introduce the general
definition of a vector space that unifies all these different notions of a vector.

Vector Spaces

As suggested at the end of chapter 4, the vector spaces Rn are not the only
vector spaces. We now give a general definition that includes Rn for all
values of n, and RS for all sets S, and more. This mathematical structure is
applicable to a wide range of real-world problems and allows for tremendous
economy of thought; the idea of a basis for a vector space will drive home
the main idea of vector spaces; they are sets with very simple structure.
The two key properties of vectors are that they can be added together
and multiplied by scalars. Thus, before giving a rigorous definition of vector
spaces, we restate the main idea.

A vector space is a set that is closed under addition and
scalar multiplication.
Definition A vector space (V, +, . , R) is a set V with two operations +
and · satisfying the following properties for all u, v ∈ V and c, d ∈ R:
(+i) (Additive Closure) u + v ∈ V . Adding two vectors gives a vector.
(+ii) (Additive Commutativity) u + v = v + u. Order of addition does not
matter.
(+iii) (Additive Associativity) (u + v) + w = u + (v + w). Order of adding
many vectors does not matter.
101

102

Vector Spaces
(+iv) (Zero) There is a special vector 0V ∈ V such that u + 0V = u for all u
in V .
(+v) (Additive Inverse) For every u ∈ V there exists w ∈ V such that
u + w = 0V .
(· i) (Multiplicative Closure) c · v ∈ V . Scalar times a vector is a vector.
(· ii) (Distributivity) (c + d) · v = c · v + d · v. Scalar multiplication distributes
over addition of scalars.
(· iii) (Distributivity) c · (u + v) = c · u + c · v. Scalar multiplication distributes
over addition of vectors.
(· iv) (Associativity) (cd) · v = c · (d · v).
(· v) (Unity) 1 · v = v for all v ∈ V .

Examples of each rule
Remark Rather than writing (V, +, . , R), we will often say “let V be a vector space
over R”. If it is obvious that the numbers used are real numbers, then “let V be a
vector space” suffices. Also, don’t confuse the scalar product · with the dot product .
The scalar product is a function that takes as its two inputs one number and one
vector and returns a vector as its output. This can be written
·: R × V → V .
Similarly
+:V ×V →V .
On the other hand, the dot product takes two vectors and returns a number. Succinctly: : V × V → R. Once the properties of a vector space have been verified,
we’ll just write scalar multiplication with juxtaposition cv = c · v, though, to keep our
notation efficient.

5.1

Examples of Vector Spaces

One can find many interesting vector spaces, such as the following:
102

5.1 Examples of Vector Spaces

103

Example of a vector space
Example 58
RN = {f | f : N → R}
Here the vector space is the set of functions that take in a natural number n and return
a real number. The addition is just addition of functions: (f1 +f2 )(n) = f1 (n)+f2 (n).
Scalar multiplication is just as simple: c · f (n) = cf (n).
We can think of these functions as infinitely large ordered lists of numbers: f (1) =
13 = 1 is the first component, f (2) = 23 = 8 is the second, and so on. Then for
example the function f (n) = n3 would look like this:


1
 8 


 27 



.
f =
.
 . .


 n3 


..
.
Thinking this way, RN is the space of all infinite sequences. Because we can not write
a list infinitely long (without infinite time and ink), one can not define an element of
this space explicitly; definitions that are implicit, as above, or algebraic as in f (n) = n3
(for all n ∈ N) suffice.
Let’s check some axioms.
(+i) (Additive Closure) (f1 + f2 )(n) = f1 (n) + f2 (n) is indeed a function N → R,
since the sum of two real numbers is a real number.
(+iv) (Zero) We need to propose a zero vector. The constant zero function g(n) = 0
works because then f (n) + g(n) = f (n) + 0 = f (n).
The other axioms should also be checked. This can be done using properties of the
real numbers.

Vector Spaces
The addition is point-wise
(f + g)(x) = f (x) + g(x) ,
as is scalar multiplication
c · f (x) = cf (x) .
RR

To check that
is a vector space use the properties of addition of functions and
scalar multiplication of functions as in the previous example.
We can not write out an explicit definition for one of these functions either, there
are not only infinitely many components, but even infinitely many components between
2
any two components! You are familiar with algebraic definitions like f (x) = ex −x+5 .
However, most vectors in this vector space can not be defined algebraically. For
example, the nowhere continuous function
(
1, x ∈ Q
f (x) =
.
0, x ∈
/Q
Example 60 R{∗,?,#} = {f : {∗, ?, #} → R}. Again, the properties of addition and
scalar multiplication of functions show that this is a vector space.

You can probably figure out how to show that RS is vector space for any
set S. This might lead you to guess that all vector spaces are of the form RS
for some set S. The following is a counterexample.
Example 61 Another very important example of a vector space is the space of all
differentiable functions:


d
f: R→R
f exists .
dx
From calculus, we know that the sum of any two differentiable functions is differentiable, since the derivative distributes over addition. A scalar multiple of a function is also differentiable, since the derivative commutes with scalar multiplication
d
d
( dx
(cf ) = c dx
f ). The zero function is just the function such that 0(x) = 0 for every x. The rest of the vector space properties are inherited from addition and scalar
multiplication in R.

Similarly, the set of functions with at least k derivatives is always a vector
space, as is the space of functions with infinitely many derivatives. None of
these examples can be written as RS for some set S. Despite our emphasis on
such examples, it is also not true that all vector spaces consist of functions.
Examples are somewhat esoteric, so we omit them.
Another important class of examples is vector spaces that live inside Rn
but are not themselves Rn .

This example is called a subspace because it gives a vector space inside another vector
space. See chapter 9 for details. Indeed, because it is determined by the linear map
given by the matrix M , it is called ker M , or in words, the kernel of M , for this see
chapter 16.

Similarly, the solution set to any homogeneous linear equation is a vector
space: Additive and multiplicative closure follow from the following statement, made using linearity of matrix multiplication:
If M x1 = 0 and M x2 = 0 then M (c1 x1 +c2 x2 ) = c1 M x1 +c2 M x2 = 0+0 = 0.
A powerful result, called the subspace theorem (see chapter 9) guarantees,
based on the closure properties alone, that homogeneous solution sets are
vector spaces.
More generally, if V is any vector space, then any hyperplane through
the origin of V is a vector space.
105

106

Vector Spaces
Example 63 Consider the functions f (x) = ex and g(x) = e2x in RR . By taking
combinations of these two vectors we can form the plane {c1 f + c2 g|c1 , c2 ∈ R} inside
of RR . This is a vector space; some examples of vectors in it are 4ex −31e2x , πe2x −4ex
and 21 e2x .

A hyperplane which does not contain the origin cannot be a vector space
because it fails condition (+iv).
It is also possible to build new vector spaces from old ones using the
product of sets. Remember that if V and W are sets, then their product is
the new set
V × W = {(v, w)|v ∈ V, w ∈ W } ,
or in words, all ordered pairs of elements from V and W . In fact V × W is a
vector space if V and W are. We have actually been using this fact already:
Example 64 The real numbers R form a vector space (over R). The new vector space
R × R = {(x, y)|x ∈ R, y ∈ R}
has addition and scalar multiplication defined by
(x, y) + (x0 , y 0 ) = (x + x0 , y + y 0 ) and c.(x, y) = (cx, cy) .
Of course, this is just the vector space R2 = R{1,2} .

5.1.1

Non-Examples

The solution set to a linear non-homogeneous equation is not a vector space
because it does not contain the zero vector and therefore fails (iv).

Sets of functions other than those of the form RS should be carefully
checked for compliance with the definition of a vector space.
Example 67 The set of all functions which are nowhere zero
{f : R → R | f (x) 6= 0 for any x ∈ R} ,
does not form a vector space because it does not satisfy (+i). The functions f (x) =
x2 +1 and g(x) = −5 are in the set, but their sum (f +g)(x) = x2 −4 = (x+2)(x−2)
is not since (f + g)(2) = 0.

5.2

Other Fields

Above, we defined vector spaces over the real numbers. One can actually
define vector spaces over any field. This is referred to as choosing a different
base field. A field is a collection of “numbers” satisfying properties which are
listed in appendix B. An example of a field is the complex numbers,

C = x + iy | i2 = −1, x, y ∈ R .
Example 68 In quantum physics, vector spaces over C describe all possible states a
physical system can have. For example,
 

λ
V =
| λ, µ ∈ C

is the set of possible states for an electron’s spin. The vectors

describe,

respectively, an electron
with spin “up” and “down” along a given direction. Other

vectors, like

i
−i

are permissible, since the base field is the complex numbers. Such

states represent a mixture of spin up and spin down for the given direction (a rather
counterintuitive yet experimentally verifiable concept), but a given spin in some other
direction.

107

108

Vector Spaces
Complex numbers are very useful because of a special property that they
enjoy: every polynomial over the complex numbers factors into a product of
linear polynomials. For example, the polynomial
x2 + 1
doesn’t factor over real numbers, but over complex numbers it factors into
(x + i)(x − i) .
In other words, there are two solutions to
x2 = −1,
x = i and x = −i. This property has far-reaching consequences: often in
mathematics problems that are very difficult using only real numbers become
relatively simple when working over the complex numbers. This phenomenon
occurs when diagonalizing matrices, see chapter 13.
The rational numbers Q are also a field. This field is important in computer algebra: a real number given by an infinite string of numbers after the
decimal point can’t be stored by a computer. So instead rational approximations are used. Since the rationals are a field, the mathematics of vector
spaces still apply to this special case.
Another very useful field is bits
B2 = Z2 = {0, 1} ,
with the addition and multiplication rules
+ 0 1
0 0 1
1 1 0

× 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1

These rules can be summarized by the relation 2 = 0. For bits, it follows
that −1 = 1!
The theory of fields is typically covered in a class on abstract algebra or
Galois theory.

Linear Transformations

The main objects of study in any course in linear algebra are linear functions:
Definition A function L : V → W is linear if V and W are vector spaces
and
L(ru + sv) = rL(u) + sL(v)
for all u, v ∈ V and r, s ∈ R.
Reading homework: problem 1
Remark We will often refer to linear functions by names like “linear map”, “linear
operator” or “linear transformation”. In some contexts you will also see the name
“homomorphism” which generally is applied to functions from one kind of set to the
same kind of set while respecting any structures on the sets; linear maps are from
vector spaces to vector spaces that respect scalar multiplication and addition, the two
structures on vector spaces. It is common to denote a linear function by capital L
as a reminder of its linearity, but sometimes we will use just f , after all we are just
studying very special functions.

The definition above coincides with the two part description in Chapter 1;
the case r = 1, s = 1 describes additivity, while s = 0 describes homogeneity.
We are now ready to learn the powerful consequences of linearity.

The Consequence of Linearity

Now that we have a sufficiently general notion of vector space it is time to
talk about why linear operators are so special. Think about what is required
to fully specify a real function of one variable. One output must be specified
for each input. That is an infinite amount of information.
By contrast, even though a linear function can have infinitely many elements in its domain, it is specified by a very small amount of information.
Example 69 (One output specifies infinitely many)
If you know that the function L is linear and that

acts on vectors from R2 .)

Reading homework: problem 2
This is the reason that linear functions are so nice; they are secretly very
simple functions by virtue of two characteristics:
1. They act on vector spaces.
2. They act additively and homogeneously.

way it acts on the three vectors

component, and its matrix form can be read off this information. However,
not all linear functions have such nice domains.

Linear Functions on Hyperplanes

It is not always so easy to write a linear operator as a matrix. Generally,
this will amount to solving a linear systems problem. Examining a linear
function whose domain is a hyperplane is instructive.

you might suspect that L is equivalent to one of these 3 × 3 matrices. It is not. By
the natural domain convention, all 3 × 3 matrices have R3 as their domain, and the
domain of L is smaller than that. When we do realize this L as a matrix it will be as a
3 × 2 matrix. We can tell because the domain of L is 2 dimensional and the codomain
is 3 dimensional. (You probably already know that the plane has dimension 2, and a

114

6.3 Linear Differential Operators

line is 1 dimensional, but the careful definition of “dimension” takes some work; this
is tackled in Chapter 11.) This leads us to write

Linear Differential Operators

Your calculus class became much easier when you stopped using the limit
definition of the derivative, learned the power rule, and started using linearity
of the derivative operator.
Example 72 Let V be the vector space of polynomials of degree 2 or less with standard
addition and scalar multiplication;

It should not surprise you to learn there are infinitely many pairs of
vectors from R2 with the property that any vector can be expressed as a
linear combination of them; any pair that when used as columns of a matrix
gives an invertible matrix works. Such a pair is called a basis for R2 .
Similarly, there are infinitely many triples of vectors with the property
that any vector from R3 can be expressed as a linear combination of them:
these are the triples that used as columns of a matrix give an invertible
matrix. Such a triple is called a basis for R3 .
In a similar spirit, there are infinitely many pairs of vectors with the
property that every vector in

You probably have some intuitive notion of what dimension means (the
careful mathematical definition is given in chapter 11). Roughly speaking,
117

118

Linear Transformations
dimension is the number of independent directions available. To figure out
the dimension of a vector space, I stand at the origin, and pick a direction.
If there are any vectors in my vector space that aren’t in that direction, then
I choose another direction that isn’t in the line determined by the direction I
chose. If there are any vectors in my vector space not in the plane determined
by the first two directions, then I choose one of them as my next direction. In
other words, I choose a collection of independent vectors in the vector space
(independent vectors are defined in Chapter 10). A minimal set of independent vectors is called a basis (see Chapter 11 for the precise definition). The
number of vectors in my basis is the dimension of the vector space. Every
vector space has many bases, but all bases for a particular vector space have
the same number of vectors. Thus dimension is a well-defined concept.
The fact that every vector space (over R) has infinitely many bases is
actually very useful. Often a good choice of basis can reduce the time required
to run a calculation in dramatic ways!
In summary:
A basis is a set of vectors in terms of which it is possible to
uniquely express any other vector.

Matrices are a powerful tool for calculations involving linear transformations.
It is important to understand how to find the matrix of a linear transformation and the properties of matrices.

7.1

Linear Transformations and Matrices

Ordered, finite-dimensional, bases for vector spaces allows us to express linear
operators as matrices.

7.1.1

Basis Notation

A basis allows us to efficiently label arbitrary vectors in terms of column
vectors. Here is an example.
Example 74 Let



a b
V =
a, b, c, d ∈ R

be the vector space of 2 × 2 real matrices, with addition and scalar multiplication
defined componentwise. One choice of basis is the ordered set (or list) of matrices

Matrices
Given a particular vector and a basis, your job is to write that vector as a sum of
multiples of basis elements. Here an arbitrary vector v ∈ V is just a matrix, so we
write




= a e11 + b e12 + c e21 + d e22 .
The coefficients (a, b, c, d) of the basis vectors (e11 , e12 , e21 , e22 ) encode the information
of which matrix the vector v is. We store them in column vector by writing
 
 
a







 b
v = a e11 + b e12 + c e21 + d e22 =: (e11 , e12 , e21 , e22 ) 

The 4-vector   ∈ R encodes the vector
c d

d
(After all, v is a matrix so could not equal a column vector.) Both notations on the
right hand side of the above equation really stand for the vector obtained by multiplying
the coefficients stored in the column vector by the corresponding basis element and
then summing over them.

Next, lets consider a tautological example showing how to label column
vectors in terms of column vectors:
Example 75 (Standard Basis of R2 )
The vectors
 

are called the standard basis vectors of R2 = R{1,2} . Their description as functions
of {1, 2} are

e1 (k) =

if k = 1
, e2 (k) =
if k = 2

122



0
1

if k = 1
if k = 2 .

7.1 Linear Transformations and Matrices

123

It is natural to assign these the order: e1 is first and e2 is second. An arbitrary vector v
of R2 can be written as
 
x
v=
= xe1 + ye2 .
y
To emphasize that we are using the standard basis we define the list (or ordered set)
E = (e1 , e2 ) ,
and write

 
 
x
x
:= (e1 , e2 )
:= xe1 + ye2 = v.
y E
y

You should read this equation by saying:
“The column vector of the vector v in the basis E is

 
x
.”
y

Again, the first notation of a column vector with a subscript E refers to the vector
obtained by multiplying each basis vector by the corresponding scalar listed in the
column and then summing these, i.e. xe1 + ye2 . The second notation denotes exactly
the same thing but we first list the basis elements and then the column vector; a
useful trick because this can be read in the same way as matrix multiplication of a row
vector times a column vector–except that the entries of the row vector are themselves
vectors!

You should already try to write down the standard basis vectors for Rn
for other values of n and express an arbitrary vector in Rn in terms of them.
The last example probably seems pedantic because column vectors are already just ordered lists of numbers and the basis notation has simply allowed
us to “re-express” these as lists of numbers. Of course, this objection does
not apply to more complicated vector spaces like our first matrix example.
Moreover, as we saw earlier, there are infinitely many other pairs of vectors
in R2 that form a basis.

124

Matrices
Notice something important: there is no reason to say that β comes before b or
vice versa. That is, there is no a priori reason to give these basis elements one order
or the other. However, it will be necessary to give the basis elements an order if we
want to use them to encode other vectors. We choose one arbitrarily; let
B = (b, β)
be the ordered basis. Note that for an unordered set we use the {} parentheses while
for lists or ordered sets we use ().
As before we define
 
 
x
x
:= (b, β)
:= xb + yβ .
y B
y
You might think that the numbers x and y denote exactly the same vector as in the
previous example. However, they do not. Inserting the actual vectors that b and β
represent we have
 
  

Only in the standard basis E does the column vector of v agree with the column vector
that v actually is!

Based on the above example, you might think that our aim would be to
find the “standard basis” for any problem. In fact, this is far from the truth.
Notice, for example that the vector
 
1
v=
= e1 + e2 = b

written in the standard basis E is just
 

v=

which was easy to calculate. But in the basis B we find

124

7.1 Linear Transformations and Matrices

125

which is actually a simpler column vector! The fact that there are many
bases for any given vector space allows us to choose a basis in which our
computation is easiest. In any case, the standard basis only makes sense
for Rn . Suppose your vector space was the set of solutions to a differential
equation–what would a standard basis then be?

From Linear Operators to Matrices

Chapter 6 showed that linear functions are very special kinds of functions;
they are fully specified by their values on any basis for their domain. A
matrix records how a linear operator maps an element of the basis to a sum
of multiples in the target space basis.
More carefully, if L is a linear operator from V to W then the matrix for L
in the ordered bases B = (b1 , b2 , . . . ) for V and B 0 = (β1 , β2 , . . . ) for W , is
the array of numbers mji specified by
L(bi ) = m1i β1 + · · · + mji βj + · · ·
Remark To calculate the matrix of a linear transformation you must compute what
the linear transformation does to every input basis vector and then write the answers
in terms of the output basis vectors:

Properties of Matrices

The objects of study in linear algebra are linear operators. We have seen that
linear operators can be represented as matrices through choices of ordered
bases, and that matrices provide a means of efficient computation.
We now begin an in depth study of matrices.
Definition An r × k matrix M = (mij ) for i = 1, . . . , r; j = 1, . . . , k is a
rectangular array of real (or complex) numbers:
 1

m1 m12 · · · m1k
m2 m2 · · · m2 

k
M =  .1 .2
.
.
.
.
.
 .
.
. 
mr1 mr2 · · · mrk
133

134

Matrices
The numbers mij are called entries. The superscript indexes the row of
the matrix and the subscript indexes the column of the matrix in which mij
appears.
An r × 1 matrix v = (v1r ) = (v r ) is called a column vector , written
 
v1
 v2 
 
v =  ..  .
 . 
vr
A 1 × k matrix v = (vk1 ) = (vk ) is called a row vector , written

v = v1 v2 · · · vk .
The transpose of a column vector is the corresponding row vector and vice
versa:
Example 81 Let
 
1
v = 2 .
3
Then

vT = 1 2 3 ,
and (v T )T = v. This is an example of an involution, namely an operation which when
performed twice does nothing.

A matrix is an efficient way to store information.
Example 82 In computer graphics, you may have encountered image files with a .gif
extension. These files are actually just matrices: at the start of the file the size of the
matrix is given, after which each number is a matrix entry indicating the color of a
particular pixel in the image.
This matrix then has its rows shuffled a bit: by listing, say, every eighth row, a web
browser downloading the file can start displaying an incomplete version of the picture
before the download is complete.
Finally, a compression algorithm is applied to the matrix to reduce the file size.

134

7.3 Properties of Matrices

135

Example 83 Graphs occur in many applications, ranging from telephone networks to
airline routes. In the subject of graph theory , a graph is just a collection of vertices
and some edges connecting vertices. A matrix can be used to indicate how many edges
attach one vertex to another.

For example, the graph pictured above would have the following matrix, where mij
indicates the number of edges between the vertices labeled i and j:


2





This is an example of a symmetric matrix, since mij = mji .

Adjacency Matrix Example
The set of all r × k matrices
Mrk := {(mij )|mij ∈ R; i ∈ {1, . . . , r}; j ∈ {1 . . . k}} ,
is itself a vector space with addition and scalar multiplication defined as
follows:
M + N = (mij ) + (nij ) = (mij + nij )
rM = r(mij ) = (rmij )

135

136

Matrices
In other words, addition just adds corresponding entries in two matrices,
and scalar multiplication multiplies every entry. Notice that M1n = Rn is just
the vector space of column vectors.
Recall that we can multiply an r × k matrix by a k × 1 column vector to
produce a r × 1 column vector using the rule
MV =

k
X


mij v j .

j=1

This suggests the rule for multiplying an r × k matrix M by a k × s
matrix N : our k × s matrix N consists of s column vectors side-by-side, each
of dimension k × 1. We can multiply our r × k matrix M by each of these s
column vectors using the rule we already know, obtaining s column vectors
each of dimension r × 1. If we place these s column vectors side-by-side, we
obtain an r × s matrix M N.
That is, let


n11 n12 · · · n1s
 n2 n2 · · · n2 
s
 1 2
N =  ..
..

and call the columns N1 through Ns :

N1 =  ..  , N2 =  ..



Then

M N = M N1 N2 · · · Ns  = M N1 M N2 · · · M Ns 

Concisely: If M = (mij ) for i = 1, . . . , r; j = 1, . . . , k and N = (nij ) for
i = 1, . . . , k; j = 1, . . . , s, then M N = L where L = (`ij ) for i = i, . . . , r; j =
1, . . . , s is given by

This rule obeys linearity.
Notice that in order for the multiplication to make sense, the columns
and rows must match. For an r × k matrix M and an s × m matrix N , then
to make the product M N we must have k = s. Likewise, for the product
N M , it is required that m = r. A common shorthand for keeping track of
the sizes of the matrices involved in a given product is the following diagram.

Matrices
This fact has an obvious yet important consequence:
Theorem 7.3.1. Let M be a matrix and x a column vector. If
Mx = 0
then the vector x is orthogonal to the rows of M .
Remark Remember that the set of all vectors that can be obtained by adding up
scalar multiples of the columns of a matrix is called its column space . Similarly the
row space is the set of all row vectors obtained by adding up multiples of the rows
of a matrix. The above theorem says that if M x = 0, then the vector x is orthogonal
to every vector in the row space of M .

We know that r × k matrices can be used to represent linear transformations Rk → Rr via
k
X
i
(M V ) =
mij v j ,
j=1

which is the same rule used when we multiply an r × k matrix by a k × 1
vector to produce an r × 1 vector.
Likewise, we can use a matrix N = (nij ) to define a linear transformation
of a vector space of matrices. For example
N

L : Mks −→ Mkr ,
L(M ) = (lki ) where lki =

s
X

nij mjk .

j=1

This is the same as the rule we use to multiply matrices. In other words,
L(M ) = N M is a linear transformation.
Matrix Terminology Let M = (mij ) be a matrix. The entries mii are called
diagonal, and the set {m11 , m22 , . . .} is called the diagonal of the matrix.
Any r × r matrix is called a square matrix. A square matrix that is
zero for all non-diagonal entries is called a diagonal matrix. An example
of a square diagonal matrix is


2 0 0
0 3 0 .
0 0 0

7.3 Properties of Matrices

139

The r × r diagonal matrix with all diagonal entries equal to 1 is called
the identity matrix, Ir , or just I. An identity matrix looks like


1 0 0 ··· 0
0 1 0 · · · 0



I = 0 0 1 · · · 0 .
 .. .. .. . . .. 
. . .

0 0 0 ··· 1
The identity matrix is special because
Ir M = M Ik = M
for all M of size r × k.
Definition The transpose of an r × k matrix M = (mij ) is the k × r matrix
M T = (m̂ij )
with entries that satisfy m̂ij = mji .
A matrix M is symmetric if M = M T .

• Taking the transpose of a matrix twice does nothing. i.e., (M T )T = M .

(M N )T = N T M T .
The proof of this theorem is left to Review Question 2.

Associativity and Non-Commutativity

Many properties of matrices following from the same property for real numbers. Here is an example.
Example 87 Associativity of matrix multiplication. We know for real numbers x, y
and z that
x(yz) = (xy)z ,
i.e., the order of multiplications does not matter. The same

In the first step we just wrote out the definition for matrix multiplication, in the second
step we moved summation symbol outside the bracket (this is just the distributive
property x(y +z) = xy +xz for numbers) and in the last step we used the associativity
property for real numbers to remove the square brackets. Exactly the same reasoning

Since n × n matrices are linear transformations Rn → Rn , we can see that
the order of successive linear transformations matters.
Here is an example of matrices acting on objects in three dimensions that
also shows matrices not commuting.




M=

rotates vectors in the plane by an angle θ. We can generalize this, using block matrices,
to three dimensions. In fact the following matrices built from a 2 × 2 rotation matrix,
a 1 × 1 identity matrix and zeroes everywhere else

a block, compared with the case of N followed by M . The special case of θ = 90◦ is
shown.

• There are many ways to cut up an n × n matrix into blocks. Often
context or the entries of the matrix will suggest a useful way to divide

to partition the matrix accordingly.

7.3.3

The Algebra of Square Matrices

Not every pair of matrices can be multiplied. When multiplying two matrices,
the number of rows in the left matrix must equal the number of columns in
the right. For an r × k matrix M and an s × l matrix N , then we must
have k = s.
This is not a problem for square matrices of the same size, though.
Two n × n matrices can be multiplied in either order. For a single matrix M ∈ Mnn , we can form M 2 = M M , M 3 = M M M , and so on. It is useful
143

144

Matrices
to define
M0 = I ,
the identity matrix, just like x0 = 1 for numbers.
As a result, any polynomial can be have square matrices in it’s domain.

Trace

A large matrix contains a great deal of information, some of which often reflects the fact that you have not set up your problem efficiently. For example,
a clever choice of basis can often make the matrix of a linear transformation
very simple. Therefore, finding ways to extract the essential information of
a matrix is useful. Here we need to assume that n < ∞ otherwise there are
subtleties with convergence that we’d have to address.

Inverse Matrix

Definition A square matrix M is invertible (or nonsingular) if there
exists a matrix M −1 such that
M −1 M = I = M M −1 .

Three Properties of the Inverse

1. If A is a square matrix and B is the inverse of A, then A is the inverse
of B, since AB = I = BA. So we have the identity
(A−1 )−1 = A.
2. Notice that B −1 A−1 AB = B −1 IB = I = ABB −1 A−1 so
(AB)−1 = B −1 A−1

Figure 7.1: The formula for the inverse of a 2×2 matrix is worth memorizing!
Thus, much like the transpose, taking the inverse of a product reverses
the order of the product.
3. Finally, recall that (AB)T = B T AT . Since I T = I, then (A−1 A)T =
AT (A−1 )T = I. Similarly, (AA−1 )T = (A−1 )T AT = I. Then:
(A−1 )T = (AT )−1

Finding Inverses (Redux)

Gaussian elimination can be used to find inverse matrices. This concept is
covered in chapter 2, section 2.3.2, but is presented here again as review in
more sophisticated terms.
Suppose M is a square invertible matrix and M X = V is a linear system.
The solution must be unique because it can be found by multiplying the
equation on both sides by M −1 yielding X = M −1 V . Thus, the reduced row
echelon form of the linear system has an identity matrix on the left:


M V ∼ I M −1 V
Solving the linear system M X = V then tells us what M −1 V is.
151

152

Matrices
To solve many linear systems with the same matrix at once,
M X = V1 , M X = V2
we can consider augmented matrices with many columns on the right and
then apply Gaussian row reduction to the left side of the matrix. Once the
identity matrix is on the left side of the augmented matrix, then the solution
of each of the individual linear systems is on the right.
M V1 V2



∼ I M −1 V1 M −1 V2



To compute M −1 , we would like M −1 , rather than M −1 V to appear on
the right side of our augmented matrix. This is achieved by solving the
collection of systems M X = ek , where ek is the column vector of zeroes with
a 1 in the kth entry. I.e., the n × n identity matrix can be viewed as a bunch
of column vectors In = (e1 e2 · · · en ). So, putting the ek ’s together into an
identity matrix, we get:

At this point, we know M −1 assuming we didn’t goof up. However, row reduction is a
lengthy and involved process with lots of room for arithmetic errors, so we should check
our answer, by confirming that M M −1 = I (or if you prefer M −1 M = I):

Homogeneous Systems

Theorem 7.5.1. A square matrix M is invertible if and only if the homogeneous system
Mx = 0
has no non-zero solutions.
Proof. First, suppose that M −1 exists. Then M x = 0 ⇒ x = M −1 0 = 0.
Thus, if M is invertible, then M x = 0 has no non-zero solutions.
On the other hand, M x = 0 always has the solution x = 0. If no other
solutions exist, then M can be put into reduced row echelon form with every
variable a pivot. In this case, M −1 can be computed using the process in the
previous section.

Bit Matrices

In computer science, information is recorded using binary strings of data.
For example, the following string contains an English word:
011011000110100101101110011001010110000101110010
A bit is the basic unit of information, keeping track of a single one or zero.
Computers can add and multiply individual bits very quickly.
In chapter 5, section 5.2 it is explained how to formulate vector spaces over
fields other than real numbers. In particular, al of the properties of a vector
space make sense with numbers Z2 = {0, 1} with addition and multiplication
given by the following tables.

Application: Cryptography A very simple way to hide information is to use a substitution cipher, in which the alphabet is permuted and each letter in a message is
systematically exchanged for another. For example, the ROT-13 cypher just exchanges
a letter with the letter thirteen places before or after it in the alphabet. For example,
HELLO becomes URYYB. Applying the algorithm again decodes the message, turning
URYYB back into HELLO. Substitution ciphers are easy to break, but the basic idea
can be extended to create cryptographic systems that are practically uncrackable. For
example, a one-time pad is a system that uses a different substitution for each letter
in the message. So long as a particular set of substitutions is not used on more than
one message, the one-time pad is unbreakable.
English characters are often stored in computers in the ASCII format. In ASCII,
a single character is represented by a string of eight bits, which we can consider as a
vector in Z82 (which is like vectors in R8 , where the entries are zeros and ones). One
way to create a substitution cipher, then, is to choose an 8 × 8 invertible bit matrix
M , and multiply each letter of the message by M . Then to decode the message, each
string of eight characters would be multiplied by M −1 .
To make the message a bit tougher to decode, one could consider pairs (or longer
sequences) of letters as a single vector in Z16
2 (or a higher-dimensional space), and
then use an appropriately-sized invertible matrix. For more on cryptography, see “The
Code Book,” by Simon Singh (1999, Doubleday).

Certain matrices are easier to work with than others. In this section, we
will see how to write any square2 matrix M as the product of two simpler
matrices. We will write
M = LU ,
where:
• L is lower triangular . This means that all entries above the main
diagonal are zero. In notation, L = (lji ) with lji = 0 for all j > i.

M = LU is called an LU decomposition of M .
This is a useful trick for computational reasons; it is much easier to compute the inverse of an upper or lower triangular matrix than general matrices.
Since inverses are useful for solving linear systems, this makes solving any linear system associated to the matrix much faster as well. The determinant—a
very important quantity associated with any square matrix—is very easy to
compute for triangular matrices.

Suppose we have M = LU and want to solve the system
M X = LU X = V.
 
u

• Step 1: Set W = v  = U X.
w
• Step 2: Solve the system LW = V . This should be simple by forward
substitution since L is lower triangular. Suppose the solution to LW =
V is W0 .
• Step 3: Now solve the system U X = W0 . This should be easy by
backward substitution, since U is upper triangular. The solution to
this system is the solution to the original system.
We can think of this as using the matrix L to perform row operations on the
matrix U in order to solve the system; this idea also appears in the study of
determinants.

7.7.2

Finding an LU Decomposition.

In chapter 2, section 2.3.4, Gaussian elimination was used to find LU matrix
decompositions. These ideas are presented here again as review.
For any given matrix, there are actually many different LU decompositions. However, there is a unique LU decomposition in which the L matrix
has ones on the diagonal. In that case L is called a lower unit triangular
matrix .
To find the LU decomposition, we’ll create two sequences of matrices
L1 , L2 , . . . and U1 , U2 , . . . such that at each step, Li Ui = M . Each of the Li
will be lower triangular, but only the last Ui will be upper triangular. The
main trick for this calculation is captured by the following example:
Example 98 (An Elementary Matrix)
Consider

E=


a b c ···
.
M=
d e f ···

Lets compute EM

EM =

a
b
c
···
d + λa e + λb f + λc · · ·


.

Something neat happened here: multiplying M by E performed the row operation
R2 → R2 + λR1 on M . Another interesting fact:



E :=

obeys (check this yourself...)
E −1 E = 1 .
Hence M = E −1 EM or, writing this out

a b c ···
1 0
a

d e f ···
−λ 1
d + λa e + λb f + λc · · ·
Here the matrix on the left is lower triangular, while the matrix on the right has had
a row operation performed on it.

We would like to use the first row of M
row below it. For our running example,

6 18
M = 2 12
4 15
162

to zero out the first entry of every


7.7 LU Redux

163

so we would like to perform the row operations
1
2
R2 → R2 − R1 and R3 → R3 − R1 .

If we perform these row operations on

6

U1 = 0

M to produce

18 3
6 0 ,
3 1

we need to multiply this on the left by a lower triangular matrix L1 so that
the product L1 U1 = M still. The above example shows how to do this: Set
L1 to be the lower triangular matrix whose first column is filled with minus
the constants used to zero out the first column of M . Then


1 0 0


L1 =  31 1 0 .
2
0 1
3
By construction L1 U1 = M , but you should compute this yourself as a double
check.
Now repeat the process by zeroing the second column of U1 below the
diagonal using the second row of U1 using the row operation R3 → R3 − 12 R2
to produce


6 18 3
U2 = 0 6 0 .
0 0 1
The matrix that undoes this row operation is obtained in the same way we
found L1 above and is:


1 0 0
0 1 0 .
0 21 1
Thus our answer for L2 is the product of this matrix with L1 , namely



Notice that it is lower triangular because
163

164

Matrices

The product of lower triangular matrices is always lower triangular!
Moreover it is obtained by recording minus the constants used for all our
row operations in the appropriate columns (this always works this way).
Moreover, U2 is upper triangular and M = L2 U2 , we are done! Putting this
all together we have




6 18 3

If the matrix you’re working with has more than three rows, just continue
this process by zeroing out the next column below the diagonal, and repeat
until there’s nothing left to do.

Another LU decomposition example
The fractions in the L matrix are admittedly ugly. For two matrices
LU , we can multiply one entire column of L by a constant λ and divide the
corresponding row of U by the same constant without changing the product
of the two matrices. Then:




For matrices that are not square, LU decomposition still makes sense.
Given an m × n matrix M , for example we could write M = LU with L
a square lower unit triangular matrix, and U a rectangular matrix. Then
L will be an m × m matrix, and U will be an m × n matrix (of the same
shape as M ). From here, the process is exactly the same as for a square
matrix. We create a sequence of matrices Li and Ui that is eventually the
LU decomposition. Again, we start with L0 = I and U0 = M .



.
Then we start with L0 = I2 =
0 1
The next step is to zero-out the first column of M below the diagonal. There is
only one row to cancel, then, and it can be removed by subtracting 2 times the first
row of M to the second row of M . Then:

Determinants

Given a square matrix, is there an easy way to know when it is invertible?
Answering this fundamental question is the goal of this chapter.

8.1

The Determinant Formula

The determinant boils down a square matrix to a a single number. That
number determines whether the square matrix is invertible or not. Lets see
how this works for small matrices first.

8.1.1

Simple Examples

For small cases, we already know when a matrix is invertible. If M is a 1 × 1
matrix, then M = (m) ⇒ M −1 = (1/m). Then M is invertible if and only if
m 6= 0.
For M a 2 × 2 matrix, chapter 7 section 7.5 shows that if

then
M

Thus M is invertible if and only if

.

Determinants

Figure 8.1: Memorize the determinant formula for a 2×2 matrix!

m11 m22 − m12 m21 6= 0 .
For 2 × 2 matrices, this quantity is called the determinant of M .

m1 m12

det M = det

 1

m1 m12 m13


M = m21 m22 m23  ,
m31 m32 m33
then—see review question 1—M is non-singular if and only if:
det M = m11 m22 m33 − m11 m23 m32 + m12 m23 m31 − m12 m21 m33 + m13 m21 m32 − m13 m22 m31 6= 0.
Notice that in the subscripts, each ordering of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 occurs exactly
once. Each of these is a permutation of the set {1, 2, 3}.

8.1.2

Permutations

Consider n objects labeled 1 through n and shuffle them. Each possible shuffle is called a permutation. For example, here is an example of a permutation
of 1–5:


1 2 3 4 5
σ=
4 2 5 1 3
170

8.1 The Determinant Formula

171

We can consider a permutation σ as an invertible function from the set of
numbers [n] := {1, 2, . . . , n} to [n], so can write σ(3) = 5 in the above
example. In general we can write


1
2
3
4
5
,
σ(1) σ(2) σ(3) σ(4) σ(5)
but since the top line of any permutation is always the same, we can omit it
and just write:


σ = σ(1) σ(2) σ(3) σ(4) σ(5)
and so our example becomes simply σ = [4 2 5 1 3].
The mathematics of permutations is extensive; there are a few key properties of permutations that we’ll need:
• There are n! permutations of n distinct objects, since there are n choices
for the first object, n − 1 choices for the second once the first has been
chosen, and so on.
• Every permutation can be built up by successivelyswapping
 pairs of
objects. For example,
 to build
 up the permutation 3 1 2 from the
trivial permutation 1 2 3 , you can first swap 2 and 3, and then
swap 1 and 3.
• For any given permutation σ, there is some number of swaps it takes to
build up the permutation. (It’s simplest to use the minimum number of
swaps, but you don’t have to: it turns out that any way of building up
the permutation from swaps will have have the same parity of swaps,
either even or odd.) If this number happens to be even, then σ is
called an even permutation; if this number is odd, then σ is an odd
permutation. In fact, n! is even for all n ≥ 2, and exactly half of the
permutations are even and the other half are odd. It’s worth noting
that the trivial permutation (which sends i → i for every i) is an even
permutation, since it uses zero swaps.
Definition The sign function is a function sgn that sends permutations
to the set {−1, 1} with rule of correspondence defined by

1 if σ is even
sgn(σ) =
−1 if σ is odd.

We can use permutations to give a definition of the determinant.
Definition The determinant of n × n matrix M is

det M =

P
σ

sgn(σ) m1σ(1) m2σ(2) · · · mnσ(n) .

The sum is over all permutations of n objects; a sum over the all elements
of {σ : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n}}. Each summand is a product of n entries
from the matrix with each factor from a different row. In different terms of
the sum the column numbers are shuffled by different permutations σ.
The last statement about the summands yields a nice property of the
determinant:
Theorem 8.1.1. If M = (mij ) has a row consisting entirely of zeros, then
miσ(i) = 0 for every σ and some i. Moreover det M = 0.
Example 102 Because there are many permutations of n, writing the determinant
this way for a general matrix gives a very long sum. For n = 4, there are 24 = 4!
permutations, and for n = 5, there are already 120 = 5! permutations.

8.1 The Determinant Formula

173

This is very cumbersome.
Luckily, it is very easy to compute the determinants of certain matrices.
For example, if M is diagonal, meaning that Mji = 0 whenever i 6= j, then
all summands of the determinant involving off-diagonal entries vanish and
X
det M =
sgn(σ)m1σ(1) m2σ(2) · · · mnσ(n) = m11 m22 · · · mnn .
σ

The determinant of a diagonal matrix is
the product of its diagonal entries.
Since the identity matrix is diagonal with all diagonal entries equal to one,
we have
det I = 1.
We would like to use the determinant to decide whether a matrix is invertible. Previously, we computed the inverse of a matrix by applying row
operations. Therefore we ask what happens to the determinant when row
operations are applied to a matrix.
Swapping rows Lets swap rows i and j of a matrix M and then compute its determinant. For the permutation σ, let σ̂ be the permutation obtained by swapping positions
i and j. Clearly
sgn(σ̂) = −sgn(σ) .
Let M 0 be the matrix M with rows i and j swapped. Then (assuming i < j):
X
det M 0 =
sgn(σ) m1σ(1) · · · mjσ(i) · · · miσ(j) · · · mnσ(n)

P
P
The step replacing σ by σ̂ often causes confusion; it holds since we sum over all
permutations (see review problem 3). Thus we see that swapping rows changes the
sign of the determinant. I.e.,
det M 0 = − det M .

173

174

Determinants

Figure 8.2: Remember what row swap does to determinants!
Reading homework: problem 8.2
Applying this result to M = I (the identity matrix) yields
det Eji = −1 ,
where the matrix Eji is the identity matrix with rows i and j swapped. It is a row swap
elementary matrix.
This implies another nice property of the determinant. If two rows of the matrix
are identical, then swapping the rows changes the sign of the matrix, but leaves the
matrix unchanged. Then we see the following:
Theorem 8.1.2. If M has two identical rows, then det M = 0.

8.2

Elementary Matrices and Determinants

In chapter 2 we found the matrices that perform the row operations involved
in Gaussian elimination; we called them elementary matrices.
As a reminder, for any matrix M , and a matrix M 0 equal to M after a
row operation, multiplying by an elementary matrix E gave M 0 = EM .

We now examine what the elementary matrices to do determinants.

Row Swap

Our first elementary matrix swaps rows i and j when it is applied to a matrix
M . Explicitly, let R1 through Rn denote the rows of M , and let M 0 be the
matrix M with rows i and j swapped. Then M and M 0 can be regarded as
a block matrices (where the blocks are rows);

is just the identity matrix with rows i and j swapped. The matrix Eji is an
elementary matrix and
M 0 = Eji M .
Because det I = 1 and swapping a pair of rows changes the sign of the
determinant, we have found that
det Eji = −1 .
175

176

Determinants
Now we know that swapping a pair of rows flips the sign of the determinant so det M 0 = −detM . But det Eji = −1 and M 0 = Eji M so
det Eji M = det Eji det M .
This result hints at a general rule for determinants of products of matrices.

The next row operation is multiplying a row by a scalar. Consider


R1


M =  ...  ,

where Ri are row vectors. Let Ri (λ) be the identity matrix, with the ith
diagonal entry replaced by λ, not to be confused with the row vectors. I.e.,

Figure 8.3: Rescaling a row rescales the determinant.
Thus, multiplying a row by λ multiplies the determinant by λ. I.e.,
det Ri (λ)M = λ det M .
Since Ri (λ) is just the identity matrix with a single row multiplied by λ,
then by the above rule, the determinant of Ri (λ) is λ. Thus

We also have learnt that

Notice that if M is the identity matrix, then we have
det Sji (µ) = det(Sji (µ)I) = det I = 1 .

Determinant of Products

det Eji = −1

Elementary Determinants
Moreover we found a useful formula for determinants of products:
Theorem 8.2.1. If E is any of the elementary matrices Eji , Ri (λ), Sji (µ),
then det(EM ) = det E det M .
179

Determinants
We have seen that any matrix M can be put into reduced row echelon form
via a sequence of row operations, and we have seen that any row operation can
be achieved via left matrix multiplication by an elementary matrix. Suppose
that RREF(M ) is the reduced row echelon form of M . Then
RREF(M ) = E1 E2 · · · Ek M ,
where each Ei is an elementary matrix. We know how to compute determinants of elementary matrices and products thereof, so we ask:
What is the determinant of a square matrix in reduced row echelon form?
The answer has two cases:
1. If M is not invertible, then some row of RREF(M ) contains only zeros.
Then we can multiply the zero row by any constant λ without changing M ; by our previous observation, this scales the determinant of M
by λ. Thus, if M is not invertible, det RREF(M ) = λ det RREF(M ),
and so det RREF(M ) = 0.
2. Otherwise, every row of RREF(M ) has a pivot on the diagonal; since
M is square, this means that RREF(M ) is the identity matrix. So if
M is invertible, det RREF(M ) = 1.
Notice that because det RREF(M ) = det(E1 E2 · · · Ek M ), by the theorem
above,
det RREF(M ) = det(E1 ) · · · det(Ek ) det M .
Since each Ei has non-zero determinant, then det RREF(M ) = 0 if and only
if det M = 0. This establishes an important theorem:
Theorem 8.2.2. For any square matrix M , det M 6= 0 if and only if M is
invertible.
Since we know the determinants of the elementary matrices, we can immediately obtain the following:

Figure 8.5: Determinants measure if a matrix is invertible.
Corollary 8.2.3. Any elementary matrix Eji , Ri (λ), Sji (µ) is invertible, except for Ri (0). In fact, the inverse of an elementary matrix is another elementary matrix.
To obtain one last important result, suppose that M and N are square
n × n matrices, with reduced row echelon forms such that, for elementary
matrices Ei and Fi ,
M = E1 E2 · · · Ek RREF(M ) ,
and
N = F1 F2 · · · Fl RREF(N ) .
If RREF(M ) is the identity matrix (i.e., M is invertible), then:

det(M N ) =

det(M ) det(N )

Otherwise, M is not invertible, and det M = 0 = det RREF(M ). Then there
exists a row of zeros in RREF(M ), so Rn (λ) RREF(M ) = RREF(M ) for
any λ. Then:
det(M N ) =

Figure 8.6: “The determinant of a product is the product of determinants.”
Which implies that det(M N ) = 0 = det M det N .
Thus we have shown that for any matrices M and N ,
det(M N ) = det M det N
This result is extremely important; do not forget it!

Properties of the Determinant

We now know that the determinant of a matrix is non-zero if and only if that
matrix is invertible. We also know that the determinant is a multiplicative
function, in the sense that det(M N ) = det M det N . Now we will devise
some methods for calculating the determinant.
Recall that:
X
det M =
sgn(σ)m1σ(1) m2σ(2) · · · mnσ(n) .
σ

A minor of an n × n matrix M is the determinant of any square matrix
obtained from M by deleting one row and one column. In particular, any
entry mij of a square matrix M is associated to a minor obtained by deleting
the ith row and jth column of M .
It is possible to write the determinant of a matrix in terms of its minors
as follows:

det M =

X

sgn(σ) m1σ(1) m2σ(2) · · · mnσ(n)

σ

σ

+ ···
Here the symbols σ
/ k refers to the permutation σ with the input k removed.
The summand on the j’th line of the above formula looks like the determinant
of the minor obtained by removing the first and j’th column of M . However
we still need to replace sum of σ
/ j by a sum over permutations of column
numbers of the matrix entries of this minor. This costs a minus sign whenever
j − 1 is odd. In other words, to expand by minors we pick an entry m1j of the
first row, then add (−1)j−1 times the determinant of the matrix with row i
and column j deleted. An example will probably help:

Try to determine which row operations we made at each step of this computation.

You might suspect that determinants have similar properties with respect
to columns as what applies to rows:

If M is a square matrix then det M T = det M .

Proof. By definition,
det M =

X

sgn(σ)m1σ(1) m2σ(2) · · · mnσ(n) .

σ

For any permutation σ, there is a unique inverse permutation σ −1 that
undoes σ. If σ sends i → j, then σ −1 sends j → i. In the two-line notation
for a permutation,
to just flipping the permutation over. For

Since any permutation can be built up by transpositions, one can also find
the inverse of a permutation σ by undoing each of the transpositions used to
build up σ; this shows that one can use the same number of transpositions
to build σ and σ −1 . In particular, sgn σ = sgn σ −1 .

Let’s compute the product M adj M . For any matrix N , the i, j entry
of M N is given by taking the dot product of the ith row of M and the jth
column of N . Notice that the dot product of the ith row of M and the ith
column of adj M is just the expansion by minors of det M in the ith row.
Further, notice that the dot product of the ith row of M and the jth column
of adj M with j 6= i is the same as expanding M by minors, but with the
jth row replaced by the ith row. Since the determinant of any matrix with
a row repeated is zero, then these dot products are zero as well.
We know that the i, j entry of the product of two matrices is the dot
product of the ith row of the first by the jth column of the second. Then:
M adj M = (det M )I
Thus, when det M 6= 0, the adjoint gives an explicit formula for M −1 .

Subspaces and Spanning Sets

It is time to study vector spaces more carefully and return to some fundamental questions:
1. Subspaces: When is a subset of a vector space itself a vector space?
(This is the notion of a subspace.)
2. Linear Independence: Given a collection of vectors, is there a way to
tell whether they are independent, or if one is a “linear combination”
of the others?
3. Dimension: Is there a consistent definition of how “big” a vector space
is?
4. Basis: How do we label vectors? Can we write any vector as a sum of
some basic set of vectors? How do we change our point of view from
vectors labeled one way to vectors labeled in another way?
Let’s start at the top!

M (µX1 + νX2 ) = µM X1 + νM X2 = 0.
So P is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. Additionally, P contains the
origin (which can be derived from the above by setting µ = ν = 0). All other vector
space requirements hold for P because they hold for all vectors in R3 .

Theorem 9.1.1 (Subspace Theorem). Let U be a non-empty subset of a
vector space V . Then U is a subspace if and only if µu1 + νu2 ∈ U for
arbitrary u1 , u2 in U , and arbitrary constants µ, ν.
Proof. One direction of this proof is easy: if U is a subspace, then it is a vector
space, and so by the additive closure and multiplicative closure properties of
vector spaces, it has to be true that µu1 + νu2 ∈ U for all u1 , u2 in U and all
constants constants µ, ν.
The other direction is almost as easy: we need to show that if µu1 +νu2 ∈
U for all u1 , u2 in U and all constants µ, ν, then U is a vector space. That
is, we need to show that the ten properties of vector spaces are satisfied. We
already know that the additive closure and multiplicative closure properties
are satisfied. Further, U has all of the other eight properties because V has
them.

Note that the requirements of the subspace theorem are often referred to as
“closure”.
We can use this theorem to check if a set is a vector space. That is, if we
have some set U of vectors that come from some bigger vector space V , to
check if U itself forms a smaller vector space we need check only two things:
1. If we add any two vectors in U , do we end up with a vector in U ?
2. If we multiply any vector in U by any constant, do we end up with a
vector in U ?
If the answer to both of these questions is yes, then U is a vector space. If
not, U is not a vector space.

Because U consists of only two vectors, it clear that U is not a vector space,
since any constant multiple of these vectors should also be in U . For example,
the 0-vector is not in U , nor is U closed under vector addition.
But we know that any two vectors define a plane:

In this case, the vectors in U define the xy-plane in R3 . We can view the
xy-plane as the set of all vectors that arise as a linear combination of the two

Definition Let V be a vector space and S = {s1 , s2 , . . .} ⊂ V a subset of V .
Then the span of S, denoted span(S), is the set
span(S) := {r1 s1 + r2 s2 + · · · + rN sN | ri ∈ R, N ∈ N}.
That is, the span of S is the set of all finite linear combinations1 of
elements of S. Any finite sum of the form “a constant times s1 plus a constant
times s2 plus a constant times s3 and so on” is in the span of S.2 .

It is important that we only allow finitely many terms in our linear combinations; in
the definition above, N must be a finite number. It can be any finite number, but it must
be finite. We can relax the requirement that S = {s1 , s2 , . . .} and just let S be any set of
vectors. Then we shall write span(S) := {r1 s1 +r2 s2 +· · ·+rN sN | ri ∈ R, si ∈ S, N ∈ N, }

Lemma 9.2.1. For any subset S ⊂ V , span(S) is a subspace of V .
Proof. We need to show that span(S) is a vector space.
It suffices to show that span(S) is closed under linear combinations. Let
u, v ∈ span(S) and λ, µ be constants. By the definition of span(S), there are
constants ci and di (some of which could be zero) such that:
u = c1 s 1 + c2 s 2 + · · ·
v = d1 s1 + d2 s2 + · · ·
⇒ λu + µv = λ(c1 s1 + c2 s2 + · · · ) + µ(d1 s1 + d2 s2 + · · · )
= (λc1 + µd1 )s1 + (λc2 + µd2 )s2 + · · ·
This last sum is a linear combination of elements of S, and is thus in span(S).
Then span(S) is closed under linear combinations, and is thus a subspace
of V .
Note that this proof, like many proofs, consisted of little more than just
writing out the definitions.

Linear systems as spanning sets
Some other very important ways of building subspaces are given in the
following examples.
Example 112 (The kernel of a linear map).
Suppose L : U → V is a linear map between vector spaces. Then if
L(u) = 0 = L(u0 ) ,
linearity tells us that
L(αu + βu0 ) = αL(u) + βL(u0 ) = α0 + β0 = 0 .

200

9.2 Building Subspaces

201

Hence, thanks to the subspace theorem, the set of all vectors in U that are mapped
to the zero vector is a subspace of V . It is called the kernel of L:
kerL := {u ∈ U |L(u) = 0} ⊂ U.
Note that finding a kernel means finding a solution to a homogeneous linear equation.
Example 113 (The image of a linear map).
Suppose L : U → V is a linear map between vector spaces. Then if
v = L(u) and v 0 = L(u0 ) ,
linearity tells us that
αv + βv 0 = αL(u) + βL(u0 ) = L(αu + βu0 ) .
Hence, calling once again on the subspace theorem, the set of all vectors in V that
are obtained as outputs of the map L is a subspace. It is called the image of L:
imL := {L(u) | u ∈ U } ⊂ V.
Example 114 (An eigenspace of a linear map).
Suppose L : V → V is a linear map and V is a vector space. Then if
L(u) = λu and L(v) = λv ,
linearity tells us that
L(αu + βv) = αL(u) + βL(v) = αL(u) + βL(v) = αλu + βλv = λ(αu + βv) .
Hence, again by subspace theorem, the set of all vectors in V that obey the eigenvector
equation L(v) = λv is a subspace of V . It is called an eigenspace
Vλ := {v ∈ V |L(v) = λv}.
For most scalars λ, the only solution to L(v) = λv will be v = 0, which yields the
trivial subspace {0}. When there are nontrivial solutions to L(v) = λv, the number λ
is called an eigenvalue, and carries essential information about the map L.

Kernels, images and eigenspaces are discussed in great depth in chapters 16 and 12.

Linear Independence

Consider a plane P that includes the origin in R3 and non-zero vectors
{u, v, w} in P .

If no two of u, v and w are parallel, then P = span{u, v, w}. But any two
vectors determines a plane, so we should be able to span the plane using
only two of the vectors u, v, w. Then we could choose two of the vectors in
{u, v, w} whose span is P , and express the other as a linear combination of
those two. Suppose u and v span P . Then there exist constants d1 , d2 (not
both zero) such that w = d1 u + d2 v. Since w can be expressed in terms of u
and v we say that it is not independent. More generally, the relationship
c1 u + c2 v + c3 w = 0

ci ∈ R, some ci 6= 0

expresses the fact that u, v, w are not all independent.

if there exist constants1 c1 , c2 , . . . , cn not all zero such that
c1 v1 + c2 v2 + · · · + cn vn = 0.
Otherwise, the vectors v1 , v2 , . . . , vn are linearly independent.
Remark The zero vector 0V can never be on a list of independent vectors because
α0V = 0V for any scalar α.

Definition Any sum of vectors v1 , . . . , vk multiplied by scalars c1 , . . . , ck ,
namely
c1 v1 + · · · + ck vk ,
is called a linear combination of v1 , . . . , vk .
Theorem 10.1.1 (Linear Dependence). An ordered set of non-zero vectors
(v1 , . . . , vn ) is linearly dependent if and only if one of the vectors vk is expressible as a linear combination of the preceding vectors.
Proof. The theorem is an if and only if statement, so there are two things to
show.
205

206

Linear Independence
i. First, we show that if vk = c1 v1 + · · · ck−1 vk−1 then the set is linearly
dependent.
This is easy. We just rewrite the assumption:
c1 v1 + · · · + ck−1 vk−1 − vk + 0vk+1 + · · · + 0vn = 0.
This is a vanishing linear combination of the vectors {v1 , . . . , vn } with
not all coefficients equal to zero, so {v1 , . . . , vn } is a linearly dependent
set.
ii. Now we show that linear dependence implies that there exists k for
which vk is a linear combination of the vectors {v1 , . . . , vk−1 }.
The assumption says that
c1 v1 + c2 v2 + · · · + cn vn = 0.
Take k to be the largest number for which ck is not equal to zero. So:
c1 v1 + c2 v2 + · · · + ck−1 vk−1 + ck vk = 0.
(Note that k > 1, since otherwise we would have c1 v1 = 0 ⇒ v1 = 0,
contradicting the assumption that none of the vi are the zero vector.)
So we can rearrange the equation:
c1 v1 + c2 v2 + · · · + ck−1 vk−1 = −ck vk
c1
c2
ck−1
⇒ − k v1 − k v2 − · · · − k vk−1 = vk .

Therefore we have expressed vk as a linear combination of the previous

equal to 2. Set:
v1 = 1 + t
v2 = 1 + t2
v3 = t + t 2
v4 = 2 + t + t 2
v5 = 1 + t + t 2 .

The set {v1 , . . . , v5 } is linearly dependent, because v4 = v1 + v2 .

10.2

Showing Linear Independence

We have seen two different ways to show a set of vectors is linearly dependent:
we can either find a linear combination of the vectors which is equal to
zero, or we can express one of the vectors as a linear combination of the
other vectors. On the other hand, to check that a set of vectors is linearly
independent, we must check that every linear combination of our vectors
with non-vanishing coefficients gives something other than the zero vector.
Equivalently, to show that the set v1 , v2 , . . . , vn is linearly independent, we
must show that the equation c1 v1 + c2 v2 + · · · + cn vn = 0 has no solutions
other than c1 = c2 = · · · = cn = 0.

with c1 6= 0. Then:

Then x is in span{v2 , . . . , vn }.
When we write a vector space as the span of a list of vectors, we would like
that list to be as short as possible (this idea is explored further in chapter 11).
This can be achieved by iterating the above procedure.
Example 120 In the above example, we found that v4 = v1 + v2 . In this case,
any expression for a vector as a linear combination involving v4 can be turned into a
combination without v4 by making the substitution v4 = v1 + v2 .
Then:
S = span{1 + t, 1 + t2 , t + t2 , 2 + t + t2 , 1 + t + t2 }
= span{1 + t, 1 + t2 , t + t2 , 1 + t + t2 }.
Now we notice that 1 + t + t2 = 21 (1 + t) + 21 (1 + t2 ) + 21 (t + t2 ). So the vector
1 + t + t2 = v5 is also extraneous, since it can be expressed as a linear combination of
the remaining three vectors, v1 , v2 , v3 . Therefore
S = span{1 + t, 1 + t2 , t + t2 }.
In fact, you can check that there are no (non-zero) solutions to the linear system
c1 (1 + t) + c2 (1 + t2 ) + c3 (t + t2 ) = 0.
Therefore the remaining vectors {1 + t, 1 + t2 , t + t2 } are linearly independent, and
span the vector space S. Then these vectors are a minimal spanning set, in the sense
that no more vectors can be removed since the vectors are linearly independent. Such
a set is called a basis for S.

Basis and Dimension

In chapter 10, the notions of a linearly independent set of vectors in a vector
space V , and of a set of vectors that span V were established; any set of
vectors that span V can be reduced to some minimal collection of linearly
independent vectors; such a minimal set is called a basis of the subspace V .
Definition Let V be a vector space. Then a set S is a basis for V if S is
linearly independent and V = span S.
If S is a basis of V and S has only finitely many elements, then we say
that V is finite-dimensional. The number of vectors in S is the dimension
of V .
Suppose V is a finite-dimensional vector space, and S and T are two different bases for V . One might worry that S and T have a different number of
vectors; then we would have to talk about the dimension of V in terms of the
basis S or in terms of the basis T . Luckily this isn’t what happens. Later in
this chapter, we will show that S and T must have the same number of vectors. This means that the dimension of a vector space is basis-independent.
In fact, dimension is a very important characteristic of a vector space.
Example 121 Pn (t) (polynomials in t of degree n or less) has a basis {1, t, . . . , tn },
since every vector in this space is a sum
a0 1 + a1 t + · · · + an tn ,

ai ∈ R ,

so Pn (t) = span{1, t, . . . , tn }. This set of vectors is linearly independent; If the
polynomial p(t) = c0 1 + c1 t + · · · + cn tn = 0, then c0 = c1 = · · · = cn = 0, so p(t) is
the zero polynomial. Thus Pn (t) is finite dimensional, and dim Pn (t) = n + 1.

Theorem 11.0.1. Let S = {v1 , . . . , vn } be a basis for a vector space V .
Then every vector w ∈ V can be written uniquely as a linear combination of
vectors in the basis S:
w = c1 v1 + · · · + cn vn .
Proof. Since S is a basis for V , then span S = V , and so there exist constants ci such that w = c1 v1 + · · · + cn vn .
Suppose there exists a second set of constants di such that
w = d1 v1 + · · · + dn vn .
Then
0V

= w−w
= c1 v1 + · · · + cn vn − d1 v1 − · · · − dn vn
= (c1 − d1 )v1 + · · · + (cn − dn )vn .

If it occurs exactly once that ci 6= di , then the equation reduces to 0 =
(ci − di )vi , which is a contradiction since the vectors vi are assumed to be
non-zero.
If we have more than one i for which ci 6= di , we can use this last equation
to write one of the vectors in S as a linear combination of other vectors in S,
which contradicts the assumption that S is linearly independent. Then for
every i, ci = di .

Proof Explanation
Remark This theorem is the one that makes bases so useful–they allow us to convert
abstract vectors into column vectors. By ordering the set S we obtain B = (v1 , . . . , vn )
and can write

vector on the right–most vector spaces are not made from columns of numbers!

Worked Example
Next, we would like to establish a method for determining whether a
collection of vectors forms a basis for Rn . But first, we need to show that
any two bases for a finite-dimensional vector space has the same number of
vectors.
Lemma 11.0.2. If S = {v1 , . . . , vn } is a basis for a vector space V and
T = {w1 , . . . , wm } is a linearly independent set of vectors in V , then m ≤ n.
The idea of the proof is to start with the set S and replace vectors in S
one at a time with vectors from T , such that after each replacement we still
have a basis for V .
Reading homework: problem 1
Proof. Since S spans V , then the set {w1 , v1 , . . . , vn } is linearly dependent.
Then we can write w1 as a linear combination of the vi ; using that equation,
we can express one of the vi in terms of w1 and the remaining vj with j 6=
i. Then we can discard one of the vi from this set to obtain a linearly
independent set that still spans V . Now we need to prove that S1 is a basis;
we must show that S1 is linearly independent and that S1 spans V .
The set S1 = {w1 , v1 , . . . , vi−1 , vi+1 , . . . , vn } is linearly independent: By
the previous theorem, there was a unique way to express w1 in terms of
the set S. Now, to obtain a contradiction, suppose there is some k and
constants ci such that
vk = c0 w1 + c1 v1 + · · · + ci−1 vi−1 + ci+1 vi+1 + · · · + cn vn .
Then replacing w1 with its expression in terms of the collection S gives a way
to express the vector vk as a linear combination of the vectors in S, which
contradicts the linear independence of S. On the other hand, we cannot
express w1 as a linear combination of the vectors in {vj |j 6= i}, since the
expression of w1 in terms of S was unique, and had a non-zero coefficient for
the vector vi . Then no vector in S1 can be expressed as a combination of
other vectors in S1 , which demonstrates that S1 is linearly independent.
The set S1 spans V : For any u ∈ V , we can express u as a linear combination of vectors in S. But we can express vi as a linear combination of
215

216

Basis and Dimension
vectors in the collection S1 ; rewriting vi as such allows us to express u as
a linear combination of the vectors in S1 . Thus S1 is a basis of V with n
vectors.
We can now iterate this process, replacing one of the vi in S1 with w2 ,
and so on. If m ≤ n, this process ends with the set Sm = {w1 , . . . , wm ,
vi1 , . . . , vin−m }, which is fine.
Otherwise, we have m > n, and the set Sn = {w1 , . . . , wn } is a basis
for V . But we still have some vector wn+1 in T that is not in Sn . Since Sn
is a basis, we can write wn+1 as a combination of the vectors in Sn , which
contradicts the linear independence of the set T . Then it must be the case
that m ≤ n, as desired.

Worked Example
Corollary 11.0.3. For a finite-dimensional vector space V , any two bases
for V have the same number of vectors.
Proof. Let S and T be two bases for V . Then both are linearly independent
sets that span V . Suppose S has n vectors and T has m vectors. Then by
the previous lemma, we have that m ≤ n. But (exchanging the roles of S
and T in application of the lemma) we also see that n ≤ m. Then m = n,
as desired.

problem, check this before reading any further!) So this set of vectors is

11.1 Bases in Rn .

a basis for Rn , and dim Rn = n. This basis is often called the standard
or canonical basis for Rn . The vector with a one in the ith position and
zeros everywhere else is written ei . (You could also view it as the function
{1, 2, . . . , n} → R where ei (j) = 1 if i = j and 0 if i 6= j.) It points in the
direction of the ith coordinate axis, and has unit length. In multivariable
calculus classes, this basis is often written {î, ĵ, k̂} for R3 .
Note that it is often convenient to order basis elements, so rather than
writing a set of vectors, we would write a list. This is called an ordered
basis. For example, the canonical ordered basis for Rn is (e1 , e2 , . . . , en ). The
possibility to reorder basis vectors is not the only way in which bases are
non-unique.
Bases are not unique. While there exists a unique way to express a vector in terms
of any particular basis, bases themselves are far from unique. For example, both of
the sets

are bases for R2 . Rescaling any vector in one of these sets is already enough to show
that R2 has infinitely many bases. But even if we require that all of the basis vectors
have unit length, it turns out that there are still infinitely many bases for R2 (see
review question 3).

To see whether a set of vectors S = {v1 , . . . , vm } is a basis for Rn , we have
to check that the elements are linearly independent and that they span Rn .
From the previous discussion, we also know that m must equal n, so lets
assume S has n vectors. If S is linearly independent, then there is no nontrivial solution of the equation
0 = x1 v1 + · · · + xn vn .
Let M be a matrix whose columns are the vectors vi and X the column
vector with entries xi . Then the above equation is equivalent to requiring
that there is a unique solution to
MX = 0 .
To see if S spans Rn , we take an arbitrary vector w and solve the linear
system
w = x1 v1 + · · · + xn vn
217

218

Basis and Dimension
in the unknowns xi . For this, we need to find a unique solution for the linear
system M X = w.
Thus, we need to show that M −1 exists, so that
X = M −1 w
is the unique solution we desire. Then we see that S is a basis for Rn if and
only if det M 6= 0.
Theorem 11.1.1. Let S = {v1 , . . . , vm } be a collection of vectors in Rn .
Let M be the matrix whose columns are the vectors in S. Then S is a basis
for V if and only if m is the dimension of V and
det M 6= 0.
Remark Also observe that S is a basis if and only if RREF(M ) = I.

Matrix of a Linear Transformation (Redux)

Not only do bases allow us to describe arbitrary vectors as column vectors,
they also permit linear transformations to be expressed as matrices. This
is a very powerful tool for computations, which is covered in chapter 7 and
reviewed again here.
Suppose we have a linear transformation L : V → W and ordered input
and output bases E = (e1 , . . . , en ) and F = (f1 , . . . , fm ) for V and W respectively (of course, these need not be the standard basis–in all likelihood
V is not Rn ). Since for each ej , L(ej ) is a vector in W , there exist unique
numbers mij such that


L(ej ) = f1 m1j + · · · + fm mm

The number mij is the ith component of L(ej ) in the basis F , while the fi
are vectors (note that if α is a scalar, and v a vector, αv = vα, we have
used the latter—rather uncommon—notation in the above formula). The
numbers mij naturally form a matrix whose jth column is the column vector
displayed above. Indeed, if
v = e1 v 1 + · · · + en v n ,
Then
L(v) = L(v 1 e1 + v 2 e2 + · · · + v n en )

The array of numbers M = (mij ) is called the matrix of L in the input and
output bases E and F for V and W , respectively. This matrix will change
if we change either of the bases. Also observe that the columns of M are
computed by examining L acting on each basis vector in V expanded in the
basis vectors of W .

When the vector space is Rn and the standard basis is used, the problem
of finding the matrix of a linear transformation will seem almost trivial. It
is worthwhile working through it once in the above language though.
Example 124 Any vector in Rn can be written as a linear combination of the standard
(ordered) basis (e1 , . . . en ). The vector ei has a one in the ith position, and zeros
everywhere else. I.e.
 

Then to find the matrix of any linear transformation L : Rn → Rn , it suffices to know
what L(ei ) is for every i.
For any matrix M , observe that M ei is equal to the ith column of M . Then if the
ith column of M equals L(ei ) for every i, then M v = L(v) for every v ∈ Rn . Then
the matrix representing L in the standard basis is just the matrix whose ith column
is L(ei ).
For example, if

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

In a vector space with no structure other than the vector space rules, no
vector other than the zero vector is any more important than any other.
Once one also has a linear transformation the situation changes dramatically.
We begin with a fun example, of a type bound to reappear in your future
scientific studies:
String Theory Consider a vibrating string, whose displacement at point x at time t
is given by a function y(x, t):

The set of all displacement functions for the string can be modeled by a vector space

and

respectively. Since quantities must exist at each point on the string for the
wave equation to make sense, we required that all partial derivatives of y(x, t) exist.

225

226

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Note also that the function y(x, t) = 0 —drawn in grey—is the only special vector in
the vector space V .
We now add some extra information. The string’s behavior in time and space can
be modeled by a wave equation
∂2y
∂2y
=
,
∂t2
∂x2
which says that the acceleration of a point on the string is equal its concavity at that
point. For example, if the string were made of stretched rubber, it would prefer to be
in a straight line, so this equation makes good intuitive sense. Not all of the functions
in V are solutions to the wave equation; not all of the functions in the vector space V
describe the way a string would really vibrate. The ways a string would really vibrate
are (at least approximately) solutions to the wave equation above, which can rewritten
as a linear function
Wy = 0
where



Some examples of solutions are
y1 (x, t) = sin(t) sin(x)

y2 (x, t) = 3 sin(2t) sin(2x)

and
y3 (x, t) = sin(t) sin(x) + 3 sin(2t) sin(2x) .
Since W y = 0 is a homogeneous linear equation, linear combinations of solutions are
solutions; in other words the kernel ker(w) is a vector space. Given the linear function
W , some vectors are now more special than others.
We can use musical intuition to do more! If the ends of the string were held
fixed, we suspect that it would prefer to vibrate at certain frequencies corresponding
to musical notes. This is modeled by looking at solutions of the form
y(x, t) = sin(ωt)v(x) .
Here the periodic sine function accounts for the string’s vibratory motion, while the
function v(x) gives the shape of the string at any fixed instant of time. Observe that

as well as a new linear function

L :=

: U −→ U .
dx2

The number ω is called an angular frequency in many contexts, lets call its square λ :=
−ω 2 to match notations we will use later (notice that for this particular problem λ must
then be negative). Then, because we want W (y) = 0, which implies d2 f /dx2 = ω 2 f ,
it follows that the vector v(x) ∈ U determining the vibrating string’s shape obeys

L(v) = λv .

This is perhaps one of the most important equations in all of linear algebra! It is
the eigenvalue-eigenvector equation. In this problem we have to solve it both for λ,
to determine which frequencies (or musical notes) our string likes to sing, and the
vector v determining the string’s shape. The vector v is called an eigenvector and λ
its corresponding eigenvalue. The solution sets for each λ are called Vλ . For any λ the
set Vk is a vector space since elements of this set are solutions to the homogeneous
equation (L − λ)v = 0.

We began this chapter by stating “In a vector space, with no other structure, no vector is more important than any other.” Our aim is to show you
that when a linear operator L acts on a vector space, vectors that solve the
equation L(v) = λv play a central role.

12.1

Invariant Directions

Have a look at the linear transformation L depicted below:
227

228

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

It was picked at random by choosing a pair of vectors L(e1 ) and L(e2 ) as
the outputs of L acting on the canonical basis vectors. Notice how the unit
square with a corner at the origin is mapped to a parallelogram. The second
line of the picture shows these superimposed on one another. Now look at the
second picture on that line. There, two vectors f1 and f2 have been carefully
chosen such that if the inputs into L are in the parallelogram spanned by f1
and f2 , the outputs also form a parallelogram with edges lying along the same
two directions. Clearly this is a very special situation that should correspond
to interesting properties of L.
Now lets try an explicit example to see if we can achieve the last picture:

Now notice that for any constant c, L(cv2 ) = cL(v2 ) = 2cv2 . Then L stretches every
vector pointing in the same direction as v2 by a factor of 2.
so L fixes the direction of the vector v2 =

In short, given a linear transformation L it is sometimes possible to find a
vector v 6= 0 and constant λ 6= 0 such that Lv = λv. We call the direction of
the vector v an invariant direction. In fact, any vector pointing in the same

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
direction also satisfies this equation because L(cv) = cL(v) = λcv. More
generally, any non-zero vector v that solves
L(v) = λv
is called an eigenvector of L, and λ (which now need not be zero) is an
eigenvalue. Since the direction is all we really care about here, then any other
vector cv (so long as c 6= 0) is an equally good choice of eigenvector. Notice
that the relation “u and v point in the same direction” is an equivalence
relation.
In our example of the linear transformation L with matrix


we have seen that L enjoys the property of having two invariant directions,
represented by eigenvectors v1 and v2 with eigenvalues 1 and 2, respectively.
It would be very convenient if we could write any vector w as a linear
combination of v1 and v2 . Suppose w = rv1 + sv2 for some constants r and s.
Then
L(w) = L(rv1 + sv2 ) = rL(v1 ) + sL(v2 ) = rv1 + 2sv2 .
Now L just multiplies the number r by 1 and the number s by 2. If we could
write this as a matrix, it would look like:

with a complicated expression. In these coordinates, we see that L has a very
simple diagonal matrix, whose diagonal entries are exactly the eigenvalues
of L.
This process is called diagonalization. It makes complicated linear systems much easier to analyze.

Now that we’ve seen what eigenvalues and eigenvectors are, there are a
number of questions that need to be answered.
• How do we find eigenvectors and their eigenvalues?
• How many eigenvalues and (independent) eigenvectors does a given
linear transformation have?
• When can a linear transformation be diagonalized?
We will start by trying to find the eigenvectors for a linear transformation.

The Eigenvalue–Eigenvector Equation

In section 12, we developed the idea of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the
case of linear transformations R2 → R2 . In this section, we will develop the
idea more generally.

Eigenvalues
Definition If L : V → V is linear and for some scalar λ and v 6= 0V
Lv = λv.
then λ is an eigenvalue of L with eigenvector v.
This equation says that the direction of v is invariant (unchanged) under L.
Let’s try to understand this equation better in terms of matrices. Let V
be a finite-dimensional vector space and let L : V → V . If we have a basis
for V we can represent L by a square matrix M and find eigenvalues λ and
associated eigenvectors v by solving the homogeneous system
(M − λI)v = 0.
This system has non-zero solutions if and only if the matrix
M − λI
is singular, and so we require that
1

To save writing many minus signs compute det(M − λI); which is equivalent if you
only need the roots.

233

234

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Figure 12.2: Don’t forget the characteristic polynomial; you will need it to
compute eigenvalues.

det(λI − M ) = 0.
The left hand side of this equation is a polynomial in the variable λ
called the characteristic polynomial PM (λ) of M . For an n × n matrix,
the characteristic polynomial has degree n. Then
PM (λ) = λn + c1 λn−1 + · · · + cn .
Notice that PM (0) = det(−M ) = (−1)n det M .
Now recall the following.
Theorem 12.2.1. (The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra) Any polynomial
can be factored into a product of first order polynomials over C.
This theorem implies that there exists a collection of n complex numbers λi (possibly with repetition) such that
PM (λ) = (λ − λ1 )(λ − λ2 ) · · · (λ − λn ) =⇒ PM (λi ) = 0.
The eigenvalues λi of M are exactly the roots of PM (λ). These eigenvalues
could be real or complex or zero, and they need not all be different. The
number of times that any given root λi appears in the collection of eigenvalues
is called its multiplicity.

= (λ − 1)2 (λ − 4) .
So L has eigenvalues λ1 = 1 (with multiplicity 2), and λ2 = 4 (with multiplicity 1).
To find the eigenvectors associated to each eigenvalue, we solve the homogeneous
system (M − λi I)X = 0 for each i.
λ = 4: We set up the augmented matrix for the linear system:

 

of these two eigenvectors will be another eigenvector with the same eigenvalue.
More generally, let {v1 , v2 , . . .} be eigenvectors of some linear transformation L with the same eigenvalue λ. A linear combination of the vi is given
by c1 v1 + c2 v2 + · · · for some constants c1 , c2 , . . .. Then
L(c1 v1 + c2 v2 + · · · ) = c1 Lv1 + c2 Lv2 + · · · by linearity of L
= c1 λv1 + c2 λv2 + · · · since Lvi = λvi
= λ(c1 v1 + c2 v2 + · · · ).
So every linear combination of the vi is an eigenvector of L with the same
eigenvalue λ. In simple terms, any sum of eigenvectors is again an eigenvector
if they share the same eigenvalue.
The space of all vectors with eigenvalue λ is called an eigenspace. It
is, in fact, a vector space contained within the larger vector space V . It
contains 0V , since L0V = 0V = λ0V , and is closed under addition and scalar
multiplication by the above calculation. All other vector space properties are
inherited from the fact that V itself is a vector space. In other words, the
subspace theorem (9.1.1, chapter 9) ensures that Vλ := {v ∈ V |Lv = 0} is a
subspace of V .

Diagonalization

Given a linear transformation, it is highly desirable to write its matrix with
respect to a basis of eigenvectors.

13.1

Diagonalizability

Suppose we are lucky, and we have L : V → V , and the ordered basis B =
(v1 , . . . , vn ) is a set of eigenvectors for L, with eigenvalues λ1 , . . . , λn . Then:
L(v1 ) = λ1 v1
L(v2 ) = λ2 v2
..
.
L(vn ) = λn vn

As a result, the matrix of L in the basis of eigenvectors B is diagonal:

Diagonalization
Suppose that V is any n-dimensional vector space. We call a linear transformation L : V 7→ V diagonalizable if there exists a collection of n linearly
independent eigenvectors for L. In other words, L is diagonalizable if there
exists a basis for V of eigenvectors for L.
In a basis of eigenvectors, the matrix of a linear transformation is diagonal. On the other hand, if an n × n matrix is diagonal, then the standard
basis vectors ei must already be a set of n linearly independent eigenvectors.
We have shown:
Theorem 13.1.1. Given an ordered basis B for a vector space V and a
linear transformation L : V → V , then the matrix for L in the basis B is
diagonal if and only if B consists of eigenvectors for L.

Non-diagonalizable example
Reading homework: problem 1
Typically, however, we do not begin a problem with a basis of eigenvectors, but rather have to compute these. Hence we need to know how to
change from one basis to another:

13.2

Change of Basis

Suppose we have two ordered bases S = (v1 , . . . , vn ) and S 0 = (v10 , . . . , vn0 )
for a vector space V . (Here vi and vi0 are vectors, not components of vectors
in a basis!) Then we may write each vk0 uniquely as

Here, the pik are constants, which we can regard as entries of a square matrix P = (pik ). The matrix P must have an inverse since we can also write
each vj uniquely as a linear combination of the vk0 ;
vj =

vk0 qjk .

k

Then we can write
vj =

k

vi pik qjk .

i

But k pik qjk is the k, j entry of the product matrix P Q. Since the expression
for vj in the basis S is vj itself, then P Q maps each vj to itself. As a result,
each vj is an eigenvector for P Q with eigenvalue 1, so P Q is the identity, i.e.
P

P Q = I ⇔ Q = P −1 .
The matrix P is called a change of basis matrix. There is a quick and
dirty trick to obtain it; look at the formula above relating the new basis
vectors v10 , v20 , . . . vn0 to the old ones v1 , v2 , . . . , vn . In particular focus on v10
for which

This says that the first column of the change of basis matrix P is really just
the components of the vector v10 in the basis v1 , v2 , . . . , vn .
The columns of the change of basis matrix are the components
of the new basis vectors in terms of the old basis vectors.

Changing basis changes the matrix of a linear transformation. However,
as a map between vector spaces, the linear transformation is the same
no matter which basis we use. Linear transformations are the actual
objects of study of this book, not matrices; matrices are merely a convenient
way of doing computations.

Change of Basis Example
Lets now calculate how the matrix of a linear transformation changes
when changing basis. To wit, let L : V −→ W with matrix M = (mij ) in the
ordered input and output bases S = (v1 , . . . , vn ) and T = (w1 , . . . , wm ) so
L(vi ) =

Since the expression for a vector in a basis is unique, then we see that the

that

M P = QM 0

or

M 0 = Q−1 M P.

Changing to a Basis of Eigenvectors

If we are changing to a basis of eigenvectors, then there are various simplifications:
• Since L : V → V , most likely you already know the matrix M of L
using the same input basis as output basis S = (u1 , . . . , un ) (say).
• In the new basis of eigenvectors S 0 (v1 , . . . , vn ), the matrix
diagonal because Lvi = λi vi and so

• If P is the change of basis matrix from S to S 0 , the diagonal matrix of
eigenvalues D and the original matrix are related by

D = P −1 M P
This motivates the following definition:

13.3 Changing to a Basis of Eigenvectors

247

Definition A matrix M is diagonalizable if there exists an invertible matrix P and a diagonal matrix D such that
D = P −1 M P.
We can summarize as follows.
• Change of basis rearranges the components of a vector by the change
of basis matrix P , to give components in the new basis.
• To get the matrix of a linear transformation in the new basis, we conjugate the matrix of L by the change of basis matrix: M 7→ P −1 M P .
If for two matrices N and M there exists a matrix P such that M =
P N P , then we say that M and N are similar. Then the above discussion
shows that diagonalizable matrices are similar to diagonal matrices.

Corollary 13.3.1. A square matrix M is diagonalizable if and only if there
exists a basis of eigenvectors for M . Moreover, these eigenvectors are the
columns of a change of basis matrix P which diagonalizes M .

You may have noticed that we have only rarely used the dot product. That
is because many of the results we have obtained do not require a preferred
notion of lengths of vectors. Once a dot or inner product is available, lengths
of and angles between vectors can be measured–very powerful machinery and
results are available in this case.

Orthogonal and Orthonormal Bases

There are many other bases that behave in the same way as the standard
basis. As such, we will study:
• Orthogonal bases {v1 , . . . , vn }:
vi vj = 0 if i 6= j .
In other words, all vectors in the basis are perpendicular.
• Orthonormal bases {u1 , . . . , un }:
ui uj = δij .
In addition to being orthogonal, each vector has unit length.
Suppose T = {u1 , . . . , un } is an orthonormal basis for Rn . Because T is
a basis, we can write any vector v uniquely as a linear combination of the
vectors in T ;
v = c1 u1 + · · · cn un .
Since T is orthonormal, there is a very easy way to find the coefficients of this
linear combination. By taking the dot product of v with any of the vectors

This is reminiscent of an older notation, where vectors are written in juxtaposition.
This is called a “dyadic tensor”, and is still used in some applications.

256

14.2 Orthogonal and Orthonormal Bases

where h·, ·i is the inner product, you might ask whether this can be related
to a dot product? The answer to this question is yes and rather easy to
understand:
Given an orthonormal basis, the information of two vectors v and v 0 in V
can be encoded in column vectors


 
hv, u1 i
hv, u1 i

 

v = hv, u1 iu1 + · · · + hv, un iun = (u1 , . . . , un )  ...  =  ...  ,
hv, un i
hv, un i O

 

v 0 = hv 0 , u1 iu1 + · · · + hv 0 , un iun = (u1 , . . . , un )  ...  =  ...  .
hv 0 , un i
hv 0 , un i O
The dot product of these two column vectors is

 

hv, u1 i
hv 0 , u1 i
 ..   .. 
0
0
 .  ·  .  = hv, u1 ihv , u1 i + · · · + hv, un ihv, un i .
hv, un i

hv 0 , un i

This agrees exactly with the inner product of v and v 0 because
hv, v 0 i =

hv, u1 iu1 + · · · + hv, un iun , hv 0 , u1 iu1 + · · · + hv 0 , un iun

= hv, u1 ihv 0 , u1 ihu1 , u1 i + hv, u2 ihv 0 , u1 ihu2 , u1 i + · · ·
· · · + hv, un−1 ihv 0 , un ihun−1 , un i + hv, un ihv 0 , un ihun , un i
= hv, u1 ihv 0 , u1 i + · · · + hv, un ihv 0 , un i .
The above computation looks a little daunting, but only the linearity property of inner products and the fact that hui , uj i can equal either zero or
one was used. Because inner products become dot products once one uses
an orthonormal basis, we will quite often use the dot product notation in
situations where one really should write an inner product. Conversely, dot
product computations can always be rewritten in terms of an inner product,
if needed.
Example 133 Consider
the space of polynomials given by V = span{1, x} with inner

This new vector v ⊥ is orthogonal to u because

Hence, {u, v ⊥ } is an orthogonal basis for span{u, v}. When nv is notopar⊥
u
allel to u, v ⊥ 6= 0, and normalizing these vectors we obtain |u|

Sometimes we write v = v ⊥ + v k where:
u·v
u
v⊥ = v −
u·u

u·u
This is called an orthogonal decomposition because we have decomposed
v into a sum of orthogonal vectors. This decomposition depends on u; if we
change the direction of u we change v ⊥ and v k .
If u, v are linearly independent vectors in R3 , then the set {u, v ⊥ , u × v ⊥ }
would be an orthogonal basis for R3 . This set could then be normalized by
dividing each vector by its length to obtain an orthonormal basis.
However, it often occurs that we are interested in vector spaces with dimension greater than 3, and must resort to craftier means than cross products
to obtain an orthogonal basis2 .
2

Actually, given a set T of (n − 1) independent vectors in n-space, one can define an
analogue of the cross product that will produce a vector orthogonal to the span of T , using
a method exactly analogous to the usual computation for calculating the cross product
of two vectors in R3 . This only gets us the “last” orthogonal vector, though; the Gram–
Schmidt process described in this section gives a way to get a full orthogonal basis.

The Gram-Schmidt Procedure

In fact, given an ordered set (v1 , v2 , . . .) of linearly independent vectors, we
can define an orthogonal basis for span{v1 , v2 , . . .} consisting of the vectors
v1⊥ := v1
v1⊥ · v2 ⊥
v
v1⊥ · v1⊥ 1
v ⊥ · v3
v ⊥ · v3
:= v3 − ⊥1 ⊥ v1⊥ − ⊥2 ⊥ v2⊥
v1 · v1
v2 · v2
..
.
v ⊥ · vi ⊥
v ⊥ · vi
v ⊥ · vi
:= vi − ⊥1 ⊥ v1⊥ − ⊥2 ⊥ v2⊥ − · · · − ⊥i−1 ⊥ vi−1
v1 · v1
v2 · v2
vi−1 · vi−1
..
.

v2⊥ := v2 −
v3⊥

vi⊥

Notice that each vi⊥ here depends on vj⊥ for every j < i. This allows us to
inductively/algorithmically build up a linearly independent, orthogonal set
of vectors {v1⊥ , v2⊥ , . . .} such that span{v1⊥ , v2⊥ , . . .} = span{v1 , v2 , . . .}. That
is, an orthogonal basis for the latter vector space.
Note that the set of vectors you start out with needs to be ordered to
uniquely specify the algorithm; changing the order of the vectors will give a
different orthogonal basis. You might need to be the one to put an order on
the initial set of vectors.
This algorithm is called the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization procedure–Gram worked at a Danish insurance company over one hundred years
ago, Schmidt was a student of Hilbert (the famous German mathmatician).

QR Decomposition

In Chapter 7, Section 7.7 teaches you how to solve linear systems by decomposing a matrix M into a product of lower and upper triangular matrices
M = LU .
The Gram–Schmidt procedure suggests another matrix decomposition,
M = QR ,
where Q is an orthogonal matrix and R is an upper triangular matrix. Socalled QR-decompositions are useful for solving linear systems, eigenvalue
problems and least squares approximations. You can easily get the idea
behind the QR decomposition by working through a simple example.

What we will do is to think of the columns of M as three 3-vectors and use Gram–
Schmidt to build an orthonormal basis from these that will become the columns of
the orthogonal matrix Q. We will use the matrix R to record the steps of the Gram–
Schmidt procedure in such a way that the product QR equals M .

The matrix on the right is almost the identity matrix, save the + 51 in the second entry
of the first row, whose effect upon multiplying the two matrices precisely undoes what
we we did to the second column of the first matrix.

multiply the corresponding row of the second matrix by the same amount:

Geometrically what has happened here is easy to see. We started with three vectors
given by the columns of M and rotated them such that the first lies along the xaxis, the second in the xy-plane and the third in some other generic direction (here it
happens to be in the yz-plane).
A nice check of the above result is to verify that entry (i, j) of the matrix R equals
the dot product of the i-th column of Q with the j-th column of M . (Some people
memorize this fact and use it as a recipe for computing QR decompositions.) A good
test of your own understanding is to work out why this is true!

Let U and V be subspaces of a vector space W . In Review Exercise 2,
Chapter 9, you are asked to show that U ∩ V is a subspace of W , and that
U ∪ V is not a subspace. However, span(U ∪ V ) is certainly a subspace,
since the span of any subset of a vector space is a subspace. Notice that all
elements of span(U ∪ V ) take the form u + v with u ∈ U and v ∈ V . We call
the subspace
U + V := span(U ∪ V ) = {u + v | u ∈ U, v ∈ V }
the sum of U and V . Here, we are not adding vectors, but vector spaces to
produce a new vector space.

Notice that the addends have elements in common; 

though both of the addends are 2-dimensional their sum is not 4-dimensional.

In the special case that U and V do not have any non-zero vectors in
common, their sum is a vector space with dimension dim U + dim V .
Definition If U and V are subspaces of a vector space W such that U ∩ V = {0W }
then the vector space
U ⊕ V := span(U ∪ V ) = {u + v | u ∈ U, v ∈ V }
is the direct sum of U and V .
Remark
• When U ∩ V = {0W }, U + V = U ⊕ V.
• When U ∩ V 6= {0W }, U + V 6= U ⊕ V .

This distinction is important because the direct sum has a very nice property:
Theorem 14.6.1. If w ∈ U ⊕ V then there is only one way to write w as
the sum of a vector in U and a vector in V .
Proof. Suppose that u + v = u0 + v 0 , with u, u0 ∈ U , and v, v 0 ∈ V . Then we
could express 0 = (u − u0 ) + (v − v 0 ). Then (u − u0 ) = −(v − v 0 ). Since U
and V are subspaces, we have (u − u0 ) ∈ U and −(v − v 0 ) ∈ V . But since
these elements are equal, we also have (u − u0 ) ∈ V . Since U ∩ V = {0}, then
(u − u0 ) = 0. Similarly, (v − v 0 ) = 0. Therefore u = u0 and v = v 0 , proving
the theorem.

Here is a sophisticated algebra question:
Given a subspace U in W , what are the solutions to
U ⊕ V = W.
That is, how can we write W as the direct sum of U and something?
268

14.6 Orthogonal Complements

269

There is not a unique answer to this question as can be seen from the following
picture of subspaces in W = R3 .

However, using the inner product, there is a natural candidate U ⊥ for this
second subspace as shown below.

Definition If U is a subspace of the vector space W then the vector space

U ⊥ := w ∈ W w u = 0 for all u ∈ U
is the orthogonal complement of U in W .
Remark The symbols “U ⊥ ” are often read as “U -perp”. This is the set of all vectors
in W orthogonal to every vector in U . Notice also that in the above definition we
have implicitly assumed that the inner product isthe dot product. For a general inner
product, the above definition would read U ⊥ := w ∈ W hw, ui = 0 for all u ∈ U .

Possibly by now you are feeling overwhelmed, it may help to watch this quick
overview video.

Overview
Example 138 Consider any plane P through the origin in R3 . Then P is a subspace,
and P ⊥ is the line through the origin orthogonal to P . For example, if P is the
xy-plane, then
R3 = P ⊕ P ⊥ = {(x, y, 0)|x, y ∈ R} ⊕ {(0, 0, z)|z ∈ R}.

Theorem 14.6.2. Let U be a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space W .
Then the set U ⊥ is a subspace of W , and W = U ⊕ U ⊥ .
Proof. First, to see that U ⊥ is a subspace, we only need to check closure,
which requires a simple check: Suppose v, w ∈ U ⊥ , then we know
v u = 0 = w u (∀u ∈ U ) .
Hence
⇒ u (αv + βw) = αu v + βu w = 0 (∀u ∈ U ) ,
and so αv + βw ∈ U ⊥ .
Next, to form a direct sum between U and U ⊥ we need to show that
U ∩ U ⊥ = {0}. This holds because if u ∈ U and u ∈ U ⊥ it follows that
u u = 0 ⇔ u = 0.
Finally, we show that any vector w ∈ W is in U ⊕ U ⊥ . (This is where
we use the assumption that W is finite-dimensional.) Let e1 , . . . , en be an
orthonormal basis for U . Set:
u = (w e1 )e1 + · · · + (w en )en ∈ U ,
u⊥ = w − u .
It is easy to check that u⊥ ∈ U ⊥ (see the Gram-Schmidt procedure). Then
w = u + u⊥ , so w ∈ U ⊕ U ⊥ , and we are done.

Diagonalizing Symmetric Matrices

Symmetric matrices have many applications. For example, if we consider the
shortest distance between pairs of important cities, we might get a table like

Definition A matrix M is symmetric if M T = M.

One very nice property of symmetric matrices is that they always have
real eigenvalues. Review exercise 1 guides you through the general proof, but
below is an example for 2 × 2 matrices.

Notice that the discriminant 4b2 + (a − d)2 is always positive, so that the eigenvalues
must be real.

Now, suppose a symmetric matrix M has two distinct eigenvalues λ 6= µ
and eigenvectors x and y;
M x = λx,

M y = µy.

Consider the dot product x y = xT y = y T x and calculate
xT M y = xT µy = µx y, and
xT M y = (y T M x)T (by transposing a 1 × 1 matrix)
= (y T λx)T
= (λx y)T
= λx y.
Subtracting these two results tells us that:
0 = xT M y − xT M y = (µ − λ) x y.
Since µ and λ were assumed to be distinct eigenvalues, λ − µ is non-zero,
and so x y = 0. We have proved the following theorem.
Theorem 15.0.1. Eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.

In chapter 14 we saw that the matrix P built from any orthonormal basis
(v1 , . . . , vn ) for Rn as its columns,

P = v1 · · · vn ,
was an orthogonal matrix. This means that
P −1 = P T , or P P T = I = P T P.
Moreover, given any (unit) vector x1 , one can always find vectors x2 , . . . , xn
such that (x1 , . . . , xn ) is an orthonormal basis. (Such a basis can be obtained
using the Gram-Schmidt procedure.)
Now suppose M is a symmetric n × n matrix and λ1 is an eigenvalue
with eigenvector x1 (this is always the case because every matrix has at
least one eigenvalue–see Review Problem 3). Let P be the square matrix of
orthonormal column vectors

P = x1 x2 · · · x n ,
While x1 is an eigenvector for M , the others are not necessarily eigenvectors
for M . Then

M P = λ1 x1 M x2 · · · M xn .

The last equality follows since P T M P is symmetric. The asterisks in the
matrix are where “stuff” happens; this extra information is denoted by M̂
in the final expression. We know nothing about M̂ except that it is an
(n − 1) × (n − 1) matrix and that it is symmetric. But then, by finding an
(unit) eigenvector for M̂ , we could repeat this procedure successively. The
end result would be a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues of M on the diagonal.
Again, we have proved a theorem:
Theorem 15.0.2. Every symmetric matrix is similar to a diagonal matrix
of its eigenvalues. In other words,
M = M T ⇔ M = P DP T
where P is an orthogonal matrix and D is a diagonal matrix whose entries
are the eigenvalues of M .

Given a linear transformation
L: V → W ,
we often want to know if it has an inverse, i.e., if there exists a linear transformation
M: W →V
such that for any vector v ∈ V , we have
M Lv = v ,
and for any vector w ∈ W , we have
LM w = w .
A linear transformation is a special kind of function from one vector space to
another. So before we discuss which linear transformations have inverses, let
us first discuss inverses of arbitrary functions. When we later specialize to
linear transformations, we’ll also find some nice ways of creating subspaces.
Let f : S → T be a function from a set S to a set T . Recall that S is
called the domain of f , T is called the codomain or target of f . We now
formally introduce a term that should be familar to you from many previous
courses.

16.1

Range

Definition The range of a function f : S → T is the set
ran(f ) := {f (s)|s ∈ S} ⊂ T .
It is the subset of the codomain consisting of elements to which the function
f maps, i.e., the things in T which you can get to by starting in S and
applying f .
The range of a matrix is very easy to find; the range of a matrix is the
span of its columns. Thus, calculation of the range of a matrix is very easy
until the last step: simplification. One aught to end by the calculation by
writing the vector space as the span of a linearly independent set.

ranges through strings of equalities of ranges of matrices that differer by

Note that for most subsets U of the domain S of a function f the image of
U is not a vector space. The range of a function is the particular case of the
image where the subset of the domain is the entire domain; ranf = ImgS.
For this reason, the range of f is also sometimes called the image of f and is
sometimes denoted im(f ) or f (S). We have seen that the range of a matrix
is always a span of vectors, and hence a vector space.
Note that we prefer the phrase “range of f ” to the phrase “image of f”
because we wish to avoid confusion between homophones; the word “image”
is also used to describe a single element of the codomain assigned to a single
element of the domain. For example, one might say of the function A : R → R
with rule of correspondence A(x =) = 2x − 1 for all x in R that the image of
2 is 3 with this second meaning of the word “image” in mind. By contrast,
one would never say that the range of 2 is 3 since the former is not a function
and the latter is not a set.
For thinking about inverses of function we want to think in the oposite
direction in a sense.
Definition The pre-image of any subset U ⊂ T is
f −1 (U ) := {s ∈ S|f (s) ∈ U } ⊂ S.
The pre-image of a set U is the set of all elements of S which map to U .

16.2.1

One-to-one and Onto

The function f is one-to-one (sometimes denoted 1:1) if different elements
in S always map to different elements in T . That is, f is one-to-one if for
any elements x 6= y ∈ S, we have that f (x) 6= f (y), as pictured below.
289

290

Kernel, Range, Nullity, Rank

One-to-one functions are also called injective functions (and sometimes
called monomorphisms.) Notice that injectivity is a condition on the preimages of f .
The function f is onto if every element of T is mapped to by some element
of S. That is, f is onto if for any t ∈ T , there exists some s ∈ S such that
f (s) = t. Onto functions are also called surjective functions (and sometimes
epimorphisms.) Notice that surjectivity is a condition on the range of f .

If f is both injective and surjective, it is bijective (or an isomorphism.)

290

16.2 Image

291

Theorem 16.2.1. A function f : S → T has an inverse function g : T → S
if and only if f is bijective.
Proof. This is an “if and only if” statement so the proof has two parts.
1. (Existence of an inverse ⇒ bijective.)
Suppose that f has an inverse function g. We need to show f is bijective, which we break down into injective and surjective.
• The function f is injective: Suppose that we have s, s0 ∈ S such
that f (s) = f (s0 ). We must have that g(f (s)) = s for any s ∈ S, so
in particular g(f (s)) = s and g(f (s0 )) = s0 . But since f (s) = f (s0 ),
we have g(f (s)) = g(f (s0 )) so s = s0 . Therefore, f is injective.
• The function f is surjective: Let t be any element of T . We must
have that f (g(t)) = t. Thus, g(t) is an element of S which maps
to t. So f is surjective.
2. (Bijectivity ⇒ existence of an inverse.) Suppose that f is bijective.
Hence f is surjective, so every element t ∈ T has at least one preimage. Being bijective, f is also injective, so every t has no more than
one pre-image. Therefore, to construct an inverse function g, we simply
define g(t) to be the unique pre-image f −1 (t) of t.

Now let us specialize to functions f that are linear maps between two
vector spaces. Everything we said above for arbitrary functions is exactly
the same for linear functions. However, the structure of vector spaces lets
us say much more about one-to-one and onto functions whose domains are
vector spaces than we can say about functions on general sets. For example,
we know that a linear function always sends 0V to 0W , i.e.,

f (0V ) = 0W
In Review Exercise 2, you will show that a linear transformation is one-to-one
if and only if 0V is the only vector that is sent to 0W . Linear functions are
unlike arbitrary functions between sets in that, by looking at just one (very
special) vector, we can figure out whether f is one-to-one!

16.2.2

Kernel

Let L : V → W be a linear transformation. Suppose L is not injective. Then
we can find v1 6= v2 such that Lv1 = Lv2 . So v1 − v2 6= 0, but
L(v1 − v2 ) = 0.
Definition If L : V → W is a linear function then the set
ker L = {v ∈ V | Lv = 0W } ⊂ V
is called the kernel of L.
Notice that if L has matrix M in some basis, then finding the kernel of L
is equivalent to solving the homogeneous system
M X = 0.
Example 147 Let L(x, y) = (x + y, x + 2y, y).
To find out, we can solve the linear system:
 

Then all solutions of M X = 0 are of the form x = y = 0. In other words, ker L = {0},
and so L is injective.

once RREF is reached, note that the linear relationships between the columns
for a basis for the nullspace.

The two column vectors in this last line describe linear relations between the columns
c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 . In particular −2c1 + 1c2 = 0 and −c1 − c3 + c4 = 0.

In general, a description of the kernel of a matrix should be of the form
span{v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } with one vector vi for each non-pivot column. To agree
with the standard procedure, think about how to describe each non-pivot
column in terms of columns to its left; this will yield an expression of the
form wherein each vector has a 1 as its last non-zero entry. (Think of Column
Reduced Echelon Form, CREF.)
Thinking again of augmented matrices, if a matrix has more than one
element in its kernel then it is not invertible since the existence of multiple
solutions to M x = 0 implies that RREF M 6= I. However just because
the kernel of a linear function is trivial does not mean that the function is
invertible.

Theorem 16.2.3. If L : V −−−→ W then ker L is a subspace of V .
Proof. Notice that if L(v) = 0 and L(u) = 0, then for any constants c, d,
L(cu + dv) = 0. Then by the subspace theorem, the kernel of L is a subspace
of V .
Example 150 Let L : R3 → R be the linear transformation defined by L(x, y, z) =
(x + y + z). Then ker L consists of all vectors (x, y, z) ∈ R3 such that x + y + z = 0.
Therefore, the set
V = {(x, y, z) ∈ R3 | x + y + z = 0}
is a subspace of R3 .

When L : V → V , the above theorem has an interpretation in terms of
the eigenspaces of L. Suppose L has a zero eigenvalue. Then the associated
eigenspace consists of all vectors v such that Lv = 0v = 0; the 0-eigenspace
of L is exactly the kernel of L.
In the example where L(x, y) = (x + y, x + 2y, y), the map L is clearly
not surjective, since L maps R2 to a plane through the origin in R3 . But any
plane through the origin is a subspace. In general notice that if w = L(v)
and w0 = L(v 0 ), then for any constants c, d, linearity of L ensures that
cw + dw0 = L(cv + dv 0 ) .
Now the subspace theorem strikes again, and we have the following theorem:
Theorem 16.2.4. If L : V → W is linear then the range L(V ) is a subspace
of W .
Example 151 Let L(x, y) = (x + y, x + 2y, y). The range of L is a plane through
the origin and thus a subspace of R3 . Indeed the matrix of L in the standard basis is

Hence, when bases and a linear transformation is are given, people often refer to its
range as the column space of the corresponding matrix.

To find a basis of the range of L, we can start with a basis S = {v1 , . . . , vn }
for V . Then the most general input for L is of the form α1 v1 + · · · + αn vn .
In turn, its most general output looks like

L α1 v1 + · · · + αn vn = α1 Lv1 + · · · + αn Lvn ∈ span{Lv1 , . . . Lvn } .
Thus
L(V ) = span L(S) = span{Lv1 , . . . , Lvn } .
However, the set {Lv1 , . . . , Lvn } may not be linearly independent; we must
solve
c1 Lv1 + · · · + cn Lvn = 0 ,
to determine whether it is. By finding relations amongst the elements of
L(S) = {Lv1 , . . . , Lvn }, we can discard vectors until a basis is arrived at.
The size of this basis is the dimension of the range of L, which is known as
the rank of L.
Definition The rank of a linear transformation L is the dimension of its
range. The nullity of a linear transformation is the dimension of the kernel.
The notation for these numbers is
null L := dim ker L,

rank L := dim L(V ) = dim ran L.

Theorem 16.2.5 (Dimension Formula). Let L : V → W be a linear transformation, with V a finite-dimensional vector space1 . Then:
dim V

= dim ker V + dim L(V )
= null L + rank L.

Proof. Pick a basis for V :
{v1 , . . . , vp , u1 , . . . , uq },
where v1 , . . . , vp is also a basis for ker L. This can always be done, for example, by finding a basis for the kernel of L and then extending to a basis for V .
Then p = null L and p + q = dim V . Then we need to show that q = rank L.
To accomplish this, we show that {L(u1 ), . . . , L(uq )} is a basis for L(V ).
To see that {L(u1 ), . . . , L(uq )} spans L(V ), consider any vector w in L(V ).
Then we can find constants ci , dj such that:
w =
=
=
⇒ L(V ) =

L(c1 v1 + · · · + cp vp + d1 u1 + · · · + dq uq )
c1 L(v1 ) + · · · + cp L(vp ) + d1 L(u1 ) + · · · + dq L(uq )
d1 L(u1 ) + · · · + dq L(uq ) since L(vi ) = 0,
span{L(u1 ), . . . , L(uq )}.

Now we show that {L(u1 ), . . . , L(uq )} is linearly independent. We argue
by contradiction. Suppose there exist constants dj (not all zero) such that
0 = d1 L(u1 ) + · · · + dq L(uq )
= L(d1 u1 + · · · + dq uq ).
But since the uj are linearly independent, then d1 u1 + · · · + dq uq 6= 0, and
so d1 u1 + · · · + dq uq is in the kernel of L. But then d1 u1 + · · · + dq uq must
be in the span of {v1 , . . . , vp }, since this was a basis for the kernel. This
contradicts the assumption that {v1 , . . . , vp , u1 , . . . , uq } was a basis for V , so
we are done.
1

The formula still makes sense for infinite dimensional vector spaces, such as the space
of all polynomials, but the notion of a basis for an infinite dimensional space is more
sticky than in the finite-dimensional case. Furthermore, the dimension formula for infinite
dimensional vector spaces isn’t useful for computing the rank of a linear transformation,
since an equation like ∞ = ∞ + x cannot be solved for x. As such, the proof presented
assumes a finite basis for V .

Reading homework: problem 2
Example 152 (Row rank equals column rank)
Suppose M is an m × n matrix. The matrix M itself is a linear transformation
M : Rn → Rm but it must also be the matrix of some linear transformation
linear

L : V −→ W .
Here we only know that dim V = n and dim W = m. The rank of the map L is
the dimension of its image and also the number of linearly independent columns of
M . Hence, this is sometimes called the column rank of M . The dimension formula
predicts the dimension of the kernel, i.e. the nullity: null L = dimV − rankL = n − r.
To compute the kernel we would study the linear system
Mx = 0 ,
which gives m equations for the n-vector x. The row rank of a matrix is the number
of linearly independent rows (viewed as vectors). Each linearly independent row of M
gives an independent equation satisfied by the n-vector x. Every independent equation
on x reduces the size of the kernel by one, so if the row rank is s, then null L + s = n.
Thus we have two equations:
null L + s = n and null L = n − r .
From these we conclude the r = s. In other words, the row rank of M equals its
column rank.

Summary

We have seen that a linear transformation has an inverse if and only if it is
bijective (i.e., one-to-one and onto). We also know that linear transformations can be represented by matrices, and we have seen many ways to tell
whether a matrix is invertible. Here is a list of them:
Theorem 16.3.1 (Invertibility). Let V be an n-dimensional vector space and
suppose L : V → V is a linear transformation with matrix M in some basis.
Then M is an n × n matrix, and the following statements are equivalent:

297

298

Kernel, Range, Nullity, Rank
1. If v is any vector in Rn , then the system M x = v has exactly one
solution.
2. The matrix M is row-equivalent to the identity matrix.
3. If v is any vector in V , then L(x) = v has exactly one solution.
4. The matrix M is invertible.
5. The homogeneous system M x = 0 has no non-zero solutions.
6. The determinant of M is not equal to 0.
7. The transpose matrix M T is invertible.
8. The matrix M does not have 0 as an eigenvalue.
9. The linear transformation L does not have 0 as an eigenvalue.
10. The characteristic polynomial det(λI − M ) does not have 0 as a root.
11. The columns (or rows) of M span Rn .
12. The columns (or rows) of M are linearly independent.
13. The columns (or rows) of M are a basis for Rn .
14. The linear transformation L is injective.
15. The linear transformation L is surjective.
16. The linear transformation L is bijective.
Note: it is important that M be an n × n matrix! If M is not square,
then it can’t be invertible, and many of the statements above are no longer
equivalent to each other.
Proof. Many of these equivalences were proved earlier in other chapters.
Some were left as review questions or sample final questions. The rest are
left as exercises for the reader.

Explain your reasoning.
iii. If P is the characteristic polynomial of a 3 × 3 bit matrix, what
must the degree of P be? Given that each coefficient must be
either 0 or 1, how many possibilities are there for P ? How many
of these possible characteristic polynomials have 0 as a root? If M
is a 3×3 bit matrix chosen at random, what is the probability that
it has 0 as an eigenvalue? (Assume that you are choosing a random
matrix M in such a way as to make each characteristic polynomial
equally likely.) What is the probability that the columns of M
form a basis for B 3 ? (Hint: what is the relationship between the
kernel of M and its eigenvalues?)
Note: We could ask the same question for real vectors: If I choose a real
vector at random, what is the probability that it lies in the span
of some other vectors? In fact, once we write down a reasonable
way of choosing a random real vector, if I choose a real vector in
Rn at random, the probability that it lies in the span of n − 1
other real vectors is zero!

Consider the linear algebraic equation L(x) = v, where L : U −−−→ W and
v ∈ W are known while x is unknown. As we have seen, this system may
have one solution, no solutions, or infinitely many solutions. But if v is not
in the range of L there will never be any solutions for L(x) = v.

However, for many applications we do not need an exact solution of the
system; instead, we may only need the best approximation possible.

but when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the
Beautiful.”

Least squares and Singular Values
If the vector space W has a notion of lengths of vectors, we can try to
find x that minimizes ||L(x) − v||.

This method has many applications, such as when trying to fit a (perhaps
linear) function to a “noisy” set of observations. For example, suppose we
measured the position of a bicycle on a racetrack once every five seconds.
Our observations won’t be exact, but so long as the observations are right on
average, we can figure out a best-possible linear function of position of the
bicycle in terms of time.
Suppose M is the matrix for the linear function L : U → W in some
bases for U and W . The vectors v and x are represented by column vectors
V and X in these bases. Then we need to approximate
MX − V ≈ 0 .
Note that if dim U = n and dim W = m then M can be represented by
an m × n matrix and x and v as vectors in Rn and Rm , respectively. Thus,
we can write W = L(U ) ⊕ L(U )⊥ . Then we can uniquely write v = v k + v ⊥ ,
with v k ∈ L(U ) and v ⊥ ∈ L(U )⊥ .
Thus we should solve L(u) = v k . In components, v ⊥ is just V − M X, and
is the part we will eventually wish to minimize.
In terms of M , recall that L(V ) is spanned by the columns of M . (In
the standard basis, the columns of M are M e1 , . . ., M en .) Then v ⊥ must be
perpendicular to the columns of M . i.e., M T (V − M X) = 0, or
M T M X = M T V.
Solutions of M T M X = M T V for X are called least squares solutions to
M X = V . Notice that any solution X to M X = V is a least squares solution.
304

305
However, the converse is often false. In fact, the equation M X = V may have
no solutions at all, but still have least squares solutions to M T M X = M T V .
Observe that since M is an m × n matrix, then M T is an n × m matrix.
Then M T M is an n × n matrix, and is symmetric, since (M T M )T = M T M .
Then, for any vector X, we can evaluate X T M T M X to obtain a number. This is a very nice number, though! It is just the length |M X|2 =
(M X)T (M X) = X T M T M X.
Reading homework: problem 1
Now suppose that ker L = {0}, so that the only solution to M X = 0 is
X = 0. (This need not mean that M is invertible because M is an n × m
matrix, so not necessarily square.) However the square matrix M T M is
invertible. To see this, suppose there was a vector X such that M T M X = 0.
Then it would follow that X T M T M X = |M X|2 = 0. In other words the
vector M X would have zero length, so could only be the zero vector. But we
are assuming that ker L = {0} so M X = 0 implies X = 0. Thus the kernel
of M T M is {0} so this matrix is invertible. So, in this case, the least squares
solution (the X that solves M T M X = M V ) is unique, and is equal to
X = (M T M )−1 M T V.
In a nutshell, this is the least squares method:
• Compute M T M and M T V .
• Solve (M T M )X = M T V by Gaussian elimination.

Projection Matrices

We have seen that even if M X = V has no solutions M T M X = M T V does
have solutions. One way to think about this is, since the codomain of M is
the direct sum
codom M = ranM ⊕ ker M T
there is a unique way to write V = Vr +Vk with Vk ∈ ker M T and Vr ∈ ran M ,
and it is clear that M x = V only has a solution of V ∈ ran M ⇔ Vk = 0.
If not, then the closest thing to a solution of M X = V is a solution to

M X = Vr . We learned to find solutions to this in the previous subsection of
this book.
But here is another question, how can we determine what Vr is given M
and V ? The answer is simple; suppose X is a solution to M X = Vr . Then
M X = Vr =⇒ M T M x = M T Vr =⇒ M T M x = M T (Vr + 0)
=⇒ M T M x = M T (Vr +Vk ) =⇒ M T M x = M T V =⇒ X = (M T M )−1 M T V
if indeed M T M is invertible. Since, by assumption, X is a solution

M (M T M )−1 M T V = Vr .
That is, the matrix which projects V onto its ran M part is M (M T M )−1 M T .

Singular Value Decomposition

Suppose
linear

L : V −−−→W .
It is unlikely that dim V =: n = m := dim W so a m × n matrix M of L
in bases for V and W will not be square. Therefore there is no eigenvalue
problem we can use to uncover a preferred basis. However, if the vector
spaces V and W both have inner products, there does exist an analog of the
eigenvalue problem, namely the singular values of L.
Before giving the details of the powerful technique known as the singular
value decomposition, we note that it is an excellent example of what Eugene
Wigner called the “Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics”:
There is a story about two friends who were classmates in high school, talking about
their jobs. One of them became a statistician and was working on population trends. He
showed a reprint to his former classmate. The reprint started, as usual with the Gaussian
distribution and the statistician explained to his former classmate the meaning of the
symbols for the actual population and so on. His classmate was a bit incredulous and was
not quite sure whether the statistician was pulling his leg. “How can you know that?”
was his query. “And what is this symbol here?” “Oh,” said the statistician, this is “π.”
“And what is that?” “The ratio of the circumference of the circle to its diameter.” “Well,
now you are pushing your joke too far,” said the classmate, “surely the population has
nothing to do with the circumference of the circle.”
Eugene Wigner, Commun. Pure and Appl. Math. XIII, 1 (1960).

Whenever we mathematically model a system, any “canonical quantities”
(those that do not depend on any choices we make for calculating them) will
correspond to important features of the system. For examples, the eigenvalues of the eigenvector equation you found in review question 1, chapter 12
encode the notes and harmonics that a guitar string can play!
Singular values appear in many linear algebra applications, especially
those involving very large data sets such as statistics and signal processing.
Let us focus on the m×n matrix M of a linear transformation L : V → W
written in orthonormal bases for the input and outputs of L (notice, the
existence of these othonormal bases is predicated on having inner products for
V and W ). Even though the matrix M is not square, both the matrices M M T
and M T M are square and symmetric! In terms of linear transformations M T
is the matrix of a linear transformation
linear

L∗ : W −−−→V .

17.2 Singular Value Decomposition

Thus LL∗ : W → W and L∗ L : V → V and both have eigenvalue problems.
Moreover, as is shown in Chapter 15, both L∗ L and LL∗ have orthonormal
bases of eigenvectors, and both M M T and M T M can be diagonalized.
Next, let us make a simplifying assumption, namely ker L = {0}. This
is not necessary, but will make some of our computations simpler. Now
suppose we have found an orthonormal basis (u1 , . . . , un ) for V composed of
eigenvectors for L∗ L. That is
L∗ Lui = λi ui .
Then multiplying by L gives
LL∗ Lui = λi Lui .
I.e., Lui is an eigenvector of LL∗ . The vectors (Lu1 , . . . , Lun ) are linearly
independent, because ker L = {0} (this is where we use our simplifying assumption, but you can try and extend our analysis to the case where it no

Lets compute the angles between and lengths of these vectors. For that
we express the vectors ui in the bases used to compute the matrix M of L.
Denoting these column vectors by Ui we then compute
(M Ui ) · (M Uj ) = UiT M T M Uj = λj UiT Uj = λj Ui · Uj = λj δij .
We see that vectors (Lu1 , . . . ,√Lun ) are orthogonal but not orthonormal.
Moreover, the length of Lui is λi . Normalizing gives the orthonormal and
linearly independent ordered set

In general, this cannot be a basis for W since ker L = {0}, dim L(V ) =
dim V, and in turn dim V ≤ dim W , so n ≤ m.
However, it is a subset of the eigenvectors of LL∗ so there is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of LL∗ of the form

Now lets compute the matrix of L with respect to the orthonormal basis
O = (u1 , . . . , un ) for V and the orthonormal basis O0 = (v1 , . . . , vm ) for W .

Singular vectors and values have a very nice geometric interpretation;
they provide an orthonormal bases for the domain and range of L and give
the factors by which L stretches the orthonormal input basis vectors. This

Fields

Definition A field F is a set with two operations + and ·, such that for all
a, b, c ∈ F the following axioms are satisfied:
A1. Addition is associative (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
A2. There exists an additive identity 0.
A3. Addition is commutative a + b = b + a.
A4. There exists an additive inverse −a.
M1. Multiplication is associative (a · b) · c = a · (b · c).
M2. There exists a multiplicative identity 1.
M3. Multiplication is commutative a · b = b · a.
M4. There exists a multiplicative inverse a−1 if a 6= 0.
D. The distributive law holds a · (b + c) = ab + ac.
Roughly, all of the above mean that you have notions of +, −, × and ÷ just
as for regular real numbers.
Fields are a very beautiful structure; some examples are rational numbers Q, real numbers R, and complex numbers C. These examples are infinite, however this does not necessarily have to be the case. The smallest

Find a formula for M k for any positive integer power k. Try some simple
examples like k = 2, 3 if confused.
7. What does it mean for a function to be linear? Check that integration is a
linear function from V to V , where V = {f : R → R | f is integrable} is a
vector space over R with usual addition and scalar multiplication.

322

8. What are the four main things we need to define for a vector space? Which
of the following is a vector space over R? For those that are not vector
spaces, modify one part of the definition to make it into a vector space.
(a) V =
2 matrices
with
 { 2 ×

 entries in R}, usual matrix addition, and
a b
ka b
k·

c d

(b) V = {polynomials with complex coefficients of degree ≤ 3}, with usual
addition and scalar multiplication of polynomials.
(c) V = {vectors in R3 with at least one entry containing a 1}, with usual
addition and scalar multiplication.
9. Subspaces: If V is a vector space, we say that U is a subspace of V when the
set U is also a vector space, using the vector addition and scalar multiplication rules of the vector space V . (Remember that U ⊂ V says that “U is a
subset of V ”, i.e., all elements of U are also elements of V . The symbol ∀
means “for all” and ∈ means “is an element of”.)
Explain why additive closure (u + w ∈ U ∀ u, v ∈ U ) and multiplicative
closure (r.u ∈ U ∀ r ∈ R, u ∈ V ) ensure that (i) the zero vector 0 ∈ U and
(ii) every u ∈ U has an additive inverse.

In fact it suffices to check closure under addition and scalar multiplication
to verify that U is a vector space. Check whether the following choices of U
are vector spaces:

7. We can call a function f : V −→ W linear if the sets V and W are vector
spaces and f obeys
f (αu + βv) = αf (u) + βf (v) ,
for all u, v ∈ V and α, β ∈ R.
Now, integration is a linear transformation from the space V of all integrable functions (don’t be confused between the definition of a linear function above, and integrable functions
in V )
R ∞ f (x) which here are the Rvectors
∞
to the real numbers R, because −∞ (αf (x) + βg(x))dx = α −∞ f (x)dx +
R∞
β −∞ g(x)dx.
8. The four main ingredients are (i) a set V of vectors, (ii) a number field K
(usually K = R), (iii) a rule for adding vectors (vector addition) and (iv)
a way to multiply vectors by a number to produce a new vector (scalar
multiplication). There are, of course, ten rules that these four ingredients
must obey.
(a) This is not a vector space. Notice that distributivity of scalar multiplication requires 2u = (1 + 1)u = u + u for any vector u but

(b) This is a vector space. Although, the question does not ask you to, it is
a useful exercise to verify that all ten vector space rules are satisfied.
(c) This is not a vector space for many reasons. An easy one is that
(1, −1, 0) and (−1, 1, 0) are both in the space, but their sum (0, 0, 0) is
not (i.e., additive closure fails). The easiest way to repair this would
be to drop the requirement that there be at least one entry equaling 1.
9. (i) Thanks to multiplicative closure, if u ∈ U , so is (−1)·u. But (−1)·u+u =
(−1) · u + 1 · u = (−1 + 1) · u = 0.u = 0 (at each step in this chain of equalities
we have used the fact that V is a vector space and therefore can use its vector
space rules). In particular, this means that the zero vector of V is in U and
is its zero vector also. (ii) Also, in V , for each u there is an element −u
such that u + (−u) = 0. But by additive close, (−u) must also be in U , thus
every u ∈ U has an additive inverse.

are similar (i.e. PA (A) = P −1 PA (D)P ). Finally, compute PA (D), what can
you say about PA (A)?
9. Define what it means for a set U to be a subspace of a vector space V .
Now let U and W be non-trivial subspaces of V . Are the following also
subspaces? (Remember that ∪ means “union” and ∩ means “intersection”.)

(d) To disprove this statement, we just need to find a single counterexample. All the unit determinant examples above are actually row equivalent to the identity matrix, so focus on the bit matrices with vanishing
determinant. Then notice (for example), that

detA = 1.(2.6 − 3.5) − 1.(2.6 − 3.4) + 1.(2.5 − 2.4) = −1 .
(i) Since detA 6= 0, the homogeneous system AX = 0 only has the solution

(a) Multiplying M by λ replaces every matrix element Mσ(j)
in the formula
i
for the permanent by λMσ(j) , and therefore produces an overall factor
λn .
i
(b) Multiplying the ith row by λ replaces Mσ(j)
in the formula for the
i
permanent by λMσ(j) . Therefore the permanent is multiplied by an
overall factor λ.

(c) The permanent of a matrix transposed equals the permanent of the
original matrix, because in the formula for the permanent this amounts
to summing over permutations of rows rather than columns. But we
σ(1)
σ(2)
σ(n)
could then sort the product M1 M2 . . . Mn back into its original
order using the inverse permutation σ −1 . But summing over permutations is equivalent to summing over inverse permutations, and therefore
the permanent is unchanged.

335

336

Sample Second Midterm
(d) Swapping two rows also leaves the permanent unchanged. The argument is almost the same as in the previous part, except that we need
j
i
only reshuffle two matrix elements Mσ(i)
and Mσ(j)
(in the case where
rows i and j were swapped). Then we use the fact that summing over
all permutations σ or over all permutations σ
e obtained by swapping a
pair in σ are equivalent operations.
5. Firstly, lets call (1) = 1 (the 1 × 1 identity matrix). Then we calculate
H T = (I − 2XX T )T = I T − 2(XX T )T = I − 2(X T )T X T = I − 2XX T = H ,
which demonstrates the first equality. Now we compute
H 2 = (I − 2XX T )(I − 2XX T ) = I − 4XX T + 4XX T XX T
= I − 4XX T + 4X(X T X)X T = I − 4XX T + 4X.1.X T = I .
So, since HH = I, we have H −1 = H.
6. We know M v = λv. Hence
M 2 v = M M v = M λv = λM v = λ2 v ,
and similarly
M k v = λM k−1 v = . . . = λk v .
So v is an eigenvector of M k with eigenvalue λk .
Now let us assume v is an eigenvector of the nilpotent matrix N with eigenvalue λ. Then from above
N k v = λk v
but by nilpotence, we also have
N k v = 0.
Hence λk v = 0 and v (being an eigenvector) cannot vanish. Thus λk = 0
and in turn λ = 0.
7. Let us think about the eigenvalue problem M v = λv. This has solutions
when

9. A subset of a vector space is called a subspace if it itself is a vector space,
using the rules for vector addition and scalar multiplication inherited from
the original vector space.
(a) So long as U 6= U ∪ W 6= W the answer is no. Take, for example,
U

2
to be the x-axis in R  and W to be the
 y-axis. Then 1, 0 ∈ U and
0, 1 ∈ W , but 1, 0 + 0, 1 = 1, 1 ∈
/ U ∪ W . So U ∪ W is not
additively closed and is not a vector space (and thus not a subspace).
It is easy to draw the example described.
(b) Here the answer is always yes. The proof is not difficult. Take a vector
u and w such that u ∈ U ∩ W 3 w. This means that both u and w
are in both U and W . But, since U is a vector space, αu + βw is also
in U . Similarly, αu + βw ∈ W . Hence αu + βw ∈ U ∩ W . So closure
holds in U ∩ W and this set is a subspace by the subspace theorem.
Here, a good picture to draw is two planes through the origin in R3
intersecting at a line (also through the origin).

10. (i) We say that the vectors {v1 , v2 , . . . vn } are linearly independent if there
exist no constants c1 , c2 , . . . cn (not all vanishing) such that c1 v1 + c2 v2 +
· · · + cn vn = 0. Alternatively, we can require that there is no non-trivial
solution for scalars c1 , c2 , . . . , cn to the linear system c1 v1 + c2 v2 + · · · +
cn vn = 0. (ii) We say that these vectors span a vector space V if the set
span{v1 , v2 , . . . vn } = {c1 v1 + c2 v2 + · · · + cn vn : c1 , c2 , . . . cn ∈ R} = V . (iii)
We call {v1 , v2 , . . . vn } a basis for V if {v1 , v2 , . . . vn } are linearly independent
and span{v1 , v2 , . . . vn } = V .

any of the matrix expressions you find.
If all has gone well, you have found a way to shift coordinates

14. Captain Conundrum gives Queen Quandary a pair of newborn doves, male
and female for her birthday. After one year, this pair of doves breed and
produce a pair of dove eggs. One year later these eggs hatch yielding a new
pair of doves while the original pair of doves breed again and an additional
pair of eggs are laid. Captain Conundrum is very happy because now he will
never need to buy the Queen a present ever again!
Let us say that in year zero, the Queen has no doves. In year one she has
one pair of doves, in year two she has two pairs of doves etc... Call Fn the
number of pairs of doves in years n. For example, F0 = 0, F1 = 1 and
F2 = 1. Assume no doves die and that the same breeding pattern continues

well into the future. Then F3 = 2 because the eggs laid by the first pair of
doves in year two hatch. Notice also that in year three, two pairs of eggs are
laid (by the first and second pair of doves). Thus F4 = 3.

then there would be a non-zero solution X to M T M X = 0. But then
by multiplying on the left by X T we see that ||M X|| = 0. This in turn
implies M X = 0 which contradicts the triviality of the kernel of M .

since we know that dim R3 = 3, if U spans R3 , it will also be a basis. Then

From the 4 × 4 case above, you can see all the tricks required for a general
Vandermonde matrix. First zero out the first column by subtracting the
first row from all other rows (which leaves the determinant unchanged).

Now zero out the top row by subtracting x1 times the first column from the
second column, x1 times the second column from the third column et cetra.
Again these column operations do not change the determinant. Now factor
out x2 − x1 from the second row, x3 − x1 from the third row, etc. This
does change the determinant so we write these factors outside the remaining
determinant, which is just the same problem but for the (n − 1) × (n − 1)
case. Iterating the same procedure gives the result

from O each orbit (in reality, after several orbits, the approximations used
by the engineers in their calculations probably fail and a new computation
will be needed). In this case, the satellite will be lost in outer space and the

There are 23 = 8 different linear transformations L : B 3 → B, exactly
the same as the number of elements in B 3 .
(g) Yes, essentially just because L1 and L2 are linear transformations. In
detail for any bits (a, b) and vectors (u, v) in B 3 it is easy to check the
linearity property for (αL1 + βL2 )
(αL1 + βL2 )(au + bv) = αL1 (au + bv) + βL2 (au + bv)
= αaL1 (u) + αbL1 (v) + βaL1 (u) + βbL1 (v)
= a(αL1 (u) + βL2 (v)) + b(αL1 (u) + βL2 (v))
= a(αL1 + βL2 )(u) + b(αL1 + βL2 )(v) .
Here the first line used the definition of (αL1 + βL2 ), the second line
depended on the linearity of L1 and L2 , the third line was just algebra
and the fourth used the definition of (αL1 + βL2 ) again.

So replacing V → P V and W → P W will always give a factor P T P
inside all the products, but P T P = I for orthogonal matrices. Hence
none of the dot products in the above formula changes, so neither does
the angle between V and W .
(e) If we take the eigenvectors of M , normalize them (i.e. divide them
by their lengths), and put them in a matrix P (as columns) then P
will be an orthogonal matrix. (If it happens that λ = µ, then we
also need to make sure the eigenvectors spanning the two dimensional
eigenspace corresponding to λ are orthogonal.) Then, since M times
the eigenvectors yields just the eigenvectors back again multiplied by
their eigenvalues, it follows that M P = P D where D is the diagonal
matrix made from eigenvalues.

(h) When λ = µ and g/λ = R2 , we get the equation for a circle radius R in
the (z, w)-plane. When λ, µ and g are postive, we have the equation for
an ellipse. Vanishing g along with λ and µ of opposite signs gives a pair
of straight lines. When g is non-vanishing, but λ and µ have opposite
signs, the result is a pair of hyperbolæ. These shapes all come from
cutting a cone with a plane, and are therefore called conic sections.
13. We show that L is bijective if and only if M is invertible.
(a) We suppose that L is bijective.
i. Since L is injective, its kernel consists of the zero vector alone.
Hence
L = dim ker L = 0.
So by the Dimension Formula,
dim V = L + rank L = rank L.
Since L is surjective, L(V ) = W. Thus
rank L = dim L(V ) = dim W.
Thereby
dim V = rank L = dim W.
ii. Since dim V = dim W , the matrix M is square so we can talk
about its eigenvalues. Since L is injective, its kernel is the zero
vector alone. That is, the only solution to LX = 0 is X = 0V .
But LX is the same as M X, so the only solution to M X = 0 is
X = 0V . So M does not have zero as an eigenvalue.
iii. Since M X = 0 has no non-zero solutions, the matrix M is invertible.
(b) Now we suppose that M is an invertible matrix.
i. Since M is invertible, the system M X = 0 has no non-zero solutions. But LX is the same as M X, so the only solution to LX = 0
is X = 0V . So L does not have zero as an eigenvalue.
ii. Since LX = 0 has no non-zero solutions, the kernel of L is the
zero vector alone. So L is injective.
iii. Since M is invertible, we must have that dim V = dim W . By the
Dimension Formula, we have
dim V = L + rank L

362

363
and since ker L = {0V } we have L = dim ker L = 0, so
dim W = dim V = rank L = dim L(V ).
Since L(V ) is a subspace of W with the same dimension as W , it
must be equal to W . To see why, pick a basis B of L(V ). Each
element of B is a vector in W , so the elements of B form a linearly
independent set in W . Therefore B is a basis of W , since the size
of B is equal to dim W . So L(V ) = span B = W. So L is surjective.

What is Linear Algebra?

Hint for Review Problem 5
Looking at the problem statement we find some important information, first
that oranges always have twice as much sugar as apples, and second that the
information about the barrel is recorded as (s, f ), where s = units of sugar in
the barrel and f = number of pieces of fruit in the barrel.
We are asked to find a linear transformation relating this new representation
to the one in the lecture, where in the lecture x = the number of apples and
y = the number of oranges. This means we must create a system of equations
relating the variable x and y to the variables s and f in matrix form. Your
answer should be the matrix that transforms one set of variables into the
other.
Hint: Let λ represent the amount of sugar in each apple.
1. To find the first equation relate f to the variables x and y.
2. To find the second equation, use the hint to figure out how much sugar
is in x apples, and y oranges in terms of λ. Then write an equation for s
using x, y and λ.

to be equivalent: They are certainly not equal, because they don’t match in
each component, but since these augmented matrices represent a system, we
might want to introduce a new kind of equivalence relation.
Well we could look at the system of linear equations this represents

x+y

and notice that the solution is x = 9 and y = 18. The other augmented matrix
represents the system

This clearly has the same solution. The first and second system are related
in the sense that their solutions are the same. Notice that it is really
nice to have the augmented matrix in the second form, because the matrix
multiplication can be done in your head.

Hints for Review Question 10
This question looks harder than it actually is:

Row equivalence of matrices is an example of an equivalence
relation. Recall that a relation ∼ on a set of objects U
is an equivalence relation if the following three properties
are satisfied:
• Reflexive:

For any x ∈ U , we have x ∼ x.

• Symmetric:

For any x, y ∈ U , if x ∼ y then y ∼ x.

• Transitive:
then x ∼ z.

For any x, y and z ∈ U , if x ∼ y and y ∼ z

(For a more complete discussion of equivalence relations, see
Webwork Homework 0, Problem 4)
Show that row equivalence of augmented matrices is an equivalence
relation.
Firstly remember that an equivalence relation is just a more general version of ‘‘equals’’. Here we defined row equivalence for augmented matrices
whose linear systems have solutions by the property that their solutions are
the same.
So this question is really about the word same. Lets do a silly example:
Lets replace the set of augmented matrices by the set of people who have hair.
We will call two people equivalent if they have the same hair color. There are
three properties to check:
• Reflexive: This just requires that you have the same hair color as
yourself so obviously holds.

• Symmetric: If the first person, Bob (say) has the same hair color as a
second person Betty(say), then Bob has the same hair color as Betty, so
this holds too.

369

370

Movie Scripts
• Transitive: If Bob has the same hair color as Betty (say) and Betty has
the same color as Brenda (say), then it follows that Bob and Brenda have
the same hair color, so the transitive property holds too and we are
done.

x1 and x2 . We will call x1 and x2 the pivot variables. The third column
0
does not look like part of an identity matrix, and there is no 3 × 3 identity
in the augmented matrix. Notice there are more variables than equations and
that this means we will have to write the solutions for the system in terms of
the variable x3 . We’ll call x3 the free variable.
Let x3 = µ. (We could also just add a ‘‘dummy’’ equation x3 = x3 .) Then we
can rewrite the first equation in our system
x1 + 3x3

=

x1 + 3µ

= 2
= 2 − 3µ.

Then since the second equation doesn’t depend on µ we can keep the equation
x2 = 1,
and for a third equation we can write
x3 = µ
so that we get the system

and we want to find the solution to those systems. We will do so by doing

1. We begin by interchanging the first two rows in order to get a 1 in the
upper-left hand corner and avoiding dealing with fractions.
2. Next we subtract row 1 from row 3 and twice from row 2 to get zeros in the
left-most column.
3. Then we scale row 2 to have a 1 in the eventual pivot.
4. Finally we subtract row 2 from row 1 and three times from row 2 to get it
into Reduced Row Echelon Form.
Therefore we can write x = 1 − λ, y = 0, z = λ and w = µ, or in vector form

then subtract the corresponding rows as before. Finally scale the first row
and hence we have x = 1 and y = 2 as a unique solution.

Hint for Review Question 5
The first part for Review Question 5 is simple--just write out the associated
linear system and you will find the equation 0 = 6 which is inconsistent.
Therefore we learn that we must avoid a row of zeros preceding a non-vanishing
entry after the vertical bar.
Turning to the system of equations, we first write out the augmented matrix
and then perform two row operations


6
1 −3
0
 1 0
3
−3 
2 k 3−k 1



1 −3
0
R2 −R1 ;R3 −2R1
 0
3
3
−9  .
∼
0 k + 6 3 − k −11
Next we would like to subtract some amount of R2 from R3 to achieve a zero in
the third entry of the second column. But if
3
k+6=3−k ⇒k =− ,
2
this would produce zeros in the third row before the vertical line. You should
also check that this does not make the whole third line zero. You now have
enough information to write a complete solution.

Planes
Here we want to describe the mathematics of planes in space. The video is
summarised by the following picture:

A plane is often called R2 because it is spanned by two coordinates, and space
is called R3 and has three coordinates, usually called (x, y, z). The equation
for a plane is
ax + by + cz = d .

375

376

Movie Scripts
Lets simplify this by calling V = (x, y, z) the vector of unknowns and N =
(a, b, c). Using the dot product in R3 we have
N V = d.
Remember that when vectors are perpendicular their dot products vanish. I.e.
U V = 0 ⇔ U ⊥ V . This means that if a vector V0 solves our equation N V = d,
then so too does V0 + C whenever C is perpendicular to N . This is because
N (V0 + C) = N V0 + N C = d + 0 = d .
But C is ANY vector perpendicular to N , so all the possibilities for C span
a plane whose normal vector is N . Hence we have shown that solutions to the
equation ax + by + cz = 0 are a plane with normal vector N = (a, b, c).

Pictures and Explanation
This video considers solutions sets for linear systems with three unknowns.
These are often called (x, y, z) and label points in R3 . Lets work case by case:
• If you have no equations at all, then any (x, y, z) is a solution, so the
solution set is all of R3 . The picture looks a little silly:

• For a single equation, the solution is a plane. This is explained in
this video or the accompanying script. The picture looks like this:

• For two equations, we must look at two planes. These usually intersect
along a line, so the solution set will also (usually) be a line:

376

G.3 Vectors in Space n-Vectors

377

• For three equations, most often their intersection will be a single
point so the solution will then be unique:

• Of course stuff can go wrong. Two different looking equations could
determine the same plane, or worse equations could be inconsistent. If
the equations are inconsistent, there will be no solutions at all. For
example, if you had four equations determining four parallel planes the
solution set would be empty. This looks like this:

G.3

Vectors in Space n-Vectors

Review of Parametric Notation
The equation for a plane in three variables x, y and z looks like
ax + by + cz = d
where a, b, c, and d are constants. Lets look at the example
x + 2y + 5z = 3 .

377

378

Movie Scripts
In fact this is a system of linear equations whose solutions form a plane with
normal vector (1, 2, 5). As an augmented matrix the system is simply


1 2 5 3 .
This is actually RREF! So we can let x be our pivot variable and y, z be
represented by free parameters λ1 and λ2 :
x = λ1 ,

y = λ2 .

Thus we write the solution as
x

= −2λ1

This describes a plane parametric equation. Planes are ‘‘two-dimensional’’
because they are described by two free variables. Here’s a picture of the
resulting plane:

The Story of Your Life
This video talks about the weird notion of a ‘‘length-squared’’ for a vector
v = (x, t) given by ||v||2 = x2 − t2 used in Einstein’s theory of relativity. The

378

G.4 Vector Spaces

379

idea is to plot the story of your life on a plane with coordinates (x, t). The
coordinate x encodes where an event happened (for real life situations, we
must replace x → (x, y, z) ∈ R3 ). The coordinate t says when events happened.
Therefore you can plot your life history as a worldline as shown:

Each point on the worldline corresponds to a place and time of an event in your
life. The slope of the worldline has to do with your speed. Or to be precise,
the inverse slope is your velocity. Einstein realized that the maximum speed
possible was that of light, often called c. In the diagram above c = 1 and
corresponds to the lines x = ±t ⇒ x2 − t2 = 0. This should get you started in
your search for vectors with zero length.

Examples of Each Rule
Lets show that R2 is a vector space. To do this (unless we invent some clever
tricks) we will have to check all parts of the definition. Its worth doing
this once, so here we go:
Before we start, remember that for R2 we define vector addition and scalar
multiplication component-wise.
 
 
x1

(+i) Additive closure: We need to make sure that when we add
and
x2
y2
that we do not get something outside the original vector space R2 . This
just relies on the underlying structure of real numbers whose sums are
again real numbers so, using our component-wise addition law we have
   


x1

x1 + x2

This again relies on the underlying real numbers which for any x, y ∈ R

We are half-way done, now we need to consider the rules for scalar multiplication. Notice, that we multiply vectors by scalars (i.e. numbers) but do NOT
multiply a vectors by vectors.
(·i) Multiplicative closure: Again, we are checking that an operation does
not produce vectors
  outside the vector space. For a scalar a ∈ R, we

Example of a Vector Space
This video talks about the definition of a vector space. Even though the
defintion looks long, complicated and abstract, it is actually designed to
model a very wide range of real life situations. As an example, consider the
vector space
V = {all possible ways to hit a hockey puck} .
The different ways of hitting a hockey puck can all be considered as vectors.
You can think about adding vectors by having two players hitting the puck at
the same time. This picture shows vectors N and J corresponding to the ways
Nicole Darwitz and Jenny Potter hit a hockey puck, plus the vector obtained
when they hit the puck together.

You can also model the new vector 2J obtained by scalar multiplication by
2 by thinking about Jenny hitting the puck twice (or a world with two Jenny
Potters....). Now ask yourself questions like whether the multiplicative
distributive law
2J + 2N = 2(J + N )
make sense in this context.

Hint for Review Question 5
Lets worry about the last part of the problem. The problem can be solved
by considering a non-zero simple polynomial, such as a degree 0 polynomial,
and multiplying by i ∈ C. That is to say we take a vector p ∈ P3R and then
considering i·p. This will violate one of the vector space rules about scalars,
and you should take from this that the scalar field matters.
As a second hint, consider
√ Q (the√field of rational numbers). This is not
/ Q, so it is not closed under scalar
a vector space over R since 2 · 1 = 2 ∈
multiplication, but it is clearly a vector space over Q.

G.5

Linear Transformations

Hint for Review Question 5
The first thing we see in the problem is a definition of this new space Pn .
Elements of Pn are polynomials that look like
a0 + a1 t + a2 t2 + . . . + an tn
where the ai ’s are constants. So this means if L is a linear transformation
from P2 → P3 that the inputs of L are degree two polynomials which look like
a0 + a1 t + a2 t2
and the output will have degree three and look like
b0 + b1 t + b2 t2 + b3 t3
We also know that L is a linear transformation, so what does that mean in
this case? Well, by linearity we know that we can separate out the sum, and
pull out the constants so we get
L(a0 + a1 t + a2 t2 ) = a0 L(1) + a1 L(t) + a2 L(t2 )
Just this should be really helpful for the first two parts of the problem. The
third part of the problem is asking us to think about this as a linear algebra
problem, so lets think about how we could write this in the vector notation we
use in the class. We could write

383

384

Movie Scripts

 
a0
a0 + a1 t + a2 t2 as a1 
a2
And think for a second about how you add polynomials, you match up terms of
the same degree and add the constants component-wise. So it makes some sense
to think about polynomials this way, since vector addition is also componentwise.
We could also write the output
 
b0
b0 + b1 t + b2 t2 + b3 t3 as b1  b3
b2
Then lets look at the information given in the problem and think about it
in terms of column vectors
• L(1) = 4 but we can think of the input 1 = 1+0t + 0t2 and the output
 
4
1



4 = 4 + 0t + 0t2 0t3 and write this as L(0) = 
0

 
 
0




• L(t) = t3 This can be written as L(1) = 
0
0
1
• L(t2 ) = t − 1 It might be a little trickier to figure out how to write
t − 1 but if we write the polynomial out with the terms in order and with
zeroes next to the terms that do not appear, we can see that
 
−1



t − 1 = −1 + t + 0t2 + 0t3 corresponds to 
 0
0
 
 
−1
0
 1

So this can be written as L(0) = 
 0
1
0
Now to think about how you would write the linear transformation L as
a matrix, first think about what the dimensions of the matrix would be.
Then look at the first two parts of this problem to help you figure out
what the entries should be.

Adjacency Matrix Example
Lets think about a graph as a mini-facebook. In this tiny facebook there are
only four people, Alice, Bob, Carl, and David.
Suppose we have the following relationships
• Alice and Bob are friends.
• Alice and Carl are friends.
• Carl and Bob are friends.
• David and Bob are friends.

Now draw a picture where each person is a dot, and then draw a line between
the dots of people who are friends. This is an example of a graph if you think
of the people as nodes, and the friendships as edges.
Now lets make a 4 × 4 matrix, which is an adjacency matrix for the graph.
Make a column and a row for each of the four people. It will look a lot like a
table. When two people are friends put a 1 the the row of one and the column
of the other. For example Alice and Carl are friends so we can label the table
below.
A
A
B
C
D

D

We can continue to label the entries for each friendship. Here lets assume
that people are friends with themselves, so the diagonal will be all ones.

as a matrix


Notice that this table is symmetric across the diagonal, the same way a
multiplication table would be symmetric. This is because on facebook friendship is symmetric in the sense that you can’t be friends with someone if they
aren’t friends with you too. This is an example of a symmetric matrix.
You could think about what you would have to do differently to draw a graph
for something like twitter where you don’t have to follow everyone who follows
you. The adjacency matrix might not be symmetric then.

Do Matrices Commute?
This video shows you a funny property of matrices. Some matrix properties
look just like those for numbers. For example numbers obey
a(bc) = (ab)c
and so do matrices:
A(BC) = (AB)C.
This says the order of bracketing does not matter and is called associativity.
Now we ask ourselves whether the basic property of numbers
ab = ba ,
holds for matrices

?

AB = BA .
For this, firstly note that we need to work with square matrices even for both
orderings to even make sense. Lets take a simple 2 × 2 example, let




so this pair of matrices do commute. Lets try A and C:




1 + a2 a
1
a
AC =

and
CA =
a 1
a 1 + a2
so
AC 6= CA
and this pair of matrices does not commute. Generally, matrices usually do not
commute, and the problem of finding those that do is a very interesting one.

Matrix Exponential Example
This video shows you how to compute


For this we need to remember that the matrix exponential is defined by its
power series

Proof Explanation
In this video we will talk through the steps required to prove
tr M N = tr N M .
There are some useful things to remember, first we can write
M = (mij )

N = (nij )

and

where the upper index labels rows and the lower one columns. Then
X

MN =
mil nlj ,
l

where the ‘‘open’’ indices i and j label rows and columns, but the index l is
a ‘‘dummy’’ index because it is summed over. (We could have given it any name
we liked!).
Finally the trace is the sum over diagonal entries for which the row and
column numbers must coincide
X
tr M =
mii .
i

Hence starting from the left of the statement we want to prove, we have
XX
LHS = tr M N =
mil nli .
i

l

Next we do something obvious, just change the order of the entries mil and nli
(they are just numbers) so
XX
XX
mil nli =
nli mil .
i

l

i

l

Equally obvious, we now rename i → l and l → i so
XX
XX
mil nli =
nil mli .
i

l

l

i

Finally, since we have finite sums it is legal to change the order of summations
XX
XX
nil mli =
nil mli .
l

i

i

l

This expression is the same as the one on the line above where we started
except the m and n have been swapped so
XX
mil nli = tr N M = RHS .
i

This completes the proof. 

Hint for Review Question 4
This problem just amounts to remembering that the dot product of x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )
and y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ) is
x1 y1 + x2 y2 + · · · + xn yn .
Then try multiplying the above row vector times y T and compare.

Hint for Review Question 5
The majority of the problem comes down to showing that matrices are right
distributive. Let Mk is all n × k matrices for any n, and define the map
fR : Mk → Mm by fR (M ) = M R where R is some k × m matrix. It should be
clear that fR (α · M ) = (αM )R = α(M R) = αfR (M ) for any scalar α. Now all
that needs to be proved is that
fR (M + N ) = (M + N )R = M R + N R = fR (M ) + fR (N ),
and you can show this by looking at each entry.
We can actually generalize the concept of this problem. Let V be some
vector space and M be some collection of matrices, and we say that M is a
left-action on V if
(M · N ) ◦ v = M ◦ (N ◦ v)
for all M, N ∈ N and v ∈ V where · denoted multiplication in M (i.e. standard
matrix multiplication) and ◦ denotes the matrix is a linear map on a vector
(i.e. M (v)). There is a corresponding notion of a right action where
v ◦ (M · N ) = (v ◦ M ) ◦ N
where we treat v ◦ M as M (v) as before, and note the order in which the
matrices are applied. People will often omit the left or right because they
are essentially the same, and just say that M acts on V .

Hint for Review Question 8
This is a hint for computing exponents of matrices. So what is eA if A is a
matrix? We remember that the Taylor series for

n=0

eA =

X
An

n!
n=0

So as matrices we can think about

389

This means we are going to have an idea of what An looks like for any n. Lets
look at the example of one of the matrices in the problem. Let

There is a pattern here which is that

looks like this:

Continue this process with each of the entries using what you know about Taylor

Hint for Review Problem 3
Firstnote that (b) implies (a) is the easy direction: just think about what it
means for M to be non-singular and for a linear function to be well-defined.
Therefore we assume that M is singular which implies that there exists a nonzero vector X0 such that M X0 = 0. Now assume there exists some vector XV
such that M XV = V , and look at what happens to XV + c · X0 for any c in your
field. Lastly don’t forget to address what happens if XV does not exist.

Hint for Review Question 4
In the text, only inverses for square matrices were discussed, but there is a
notion of left and right inverses for matrices that are not square. It helps
to look at an example with bits to see why. To start with we look at vector
spaces
Z32 = {(x, y, z)|x, y, z = 0, 1}

and

Z22 = {(x, y)|x, y = 0, 1} .

These have 8 and 4 vectors, respectively, that can be depicted as corners of
a cube or square:

391

392

Movie Scripts

Z32

or Z22

Now lets consider a linear transformation
L : Z32 −→ Z22 .
This must be represented by a matrix, and lets take the example
 
 

 x
x
0
1

 y  := AX .
L y =
1 1 0
z

Since we have bits, we can work out what L does to every vector, this is listed
below
L
(0, 0, 0) 7→ (0, 0)
L

(0, 0, 1) 7→ (1, 0)
L

(1, 1, 0) 7→ (1, 0)

L

(1, 0, 1) 7→ (1, 1)
L

(1, 1, 1) 7→

(1, 1)

Now lets think about left and right inverses. A left inverse B to the matrix
A would obey
BA = I
and since the identity matrix is square, B must be 2 × 3. It would have to
undo the action of A and return vectors in Z32 to where they started from. But
above, we see that different vectors in Z32 are mapped to the same vector in Z22
by the linear transformation L with matrix A. So B cannot exist. However a
right inverse C obeying
AC = I
can. It would be 2 × 2. Its job is to take a vector in Z22 back to one in Z32 in a
way that gets undone by the action of A. This can be done, but not uniquely.

The augmented matrix you would use


This is an easy augmented matrix to solve because it is upper triangular. If
you were to write out the three equations using variables, you would find that
the first equation has already been solved, and is ready to be plugged into
the second equation. This backward substitution makes solving the system much
faster. Try it and in a few steps you should be able to get


the matrix


following the procedure outlined in Section 7.7.2. So initially we have L1 =

L2 = −3 1 0
U2 =  0

0 −1 −1
However we now have a problem since 0 · c = 0 for any value of c since we are
working over a field, but we can quickly remedy this by swapping the second and
third rows of U2 to get U20 and note that we just interchange the corresponding
rows all columns left of and including the column we added values to in L2 to
get L02 . Yet this gives us a small problem as L02 U20 6= M ; in fact it gives us
the similar matrix M 0 with the second and third rows swapped. In our original
problem M X = V , we also need to make the corresponding swap on our vector
V to get a V 0 since all of this amounts to changing the order of our two
equations, and note that this clearly does not change the solution. Back to
our example, we have





1 0 0
U20 = 0 −1 −1 ,
L02 =  1 1 0

and note that U20 is upper triangular. Finally you can easily see that



7 2
6 3 = M 0
L02 U20 =  1
−3 −21 4
which solves the problem of L02 U20 X = M 0 X = V 0 . (We note that as augmented
matrices (M 0 |V 0 ) ∼ (M |V ).)

Permutation Example
Lets try to get the hang of permutations. A permutation is a function which
scrambles things. Suppose we had

This looks like a function σ that has values
σ(1) = 3, σ(2) = 2, σ(3) = 4, σ(4) = 1 .

We could write this permutation in two steps by saying that first we swap 3
and 4, and then we swap 1 and 3. The order here is important.

This is an even permutation, since the number of swaps we used is two (an even
number).

Here we will focus on the case the M is square because we are interested in
its inverse M −1 (if it exists) and its determinant (whose job it will be to
determine the existence of M −1 ).
We know at least three ways of handling this linear system problem:
1. As an augmented matrix
M

V



.

Here our plan would be to perform row operations until the system looks
like

I M −1 V
,
(assuming that M −1 exists).

2. As a matrix equation
MX = V ,
which we would solve by finding M −1 (again, if it exists), so that
X = M −1 V .
3. As a linear transformation
L : Rn −→ Rn
via
Rn 3 X 7−→ M X ∈ Rn .
In this case we have to study the equation L(X) = V because V ∈ Rn .
Lets focus on the first two methods. In particular we want to think about
how the augmented matrix method can give information about finding M −1 . In
particular, how it can be used for handling determinants.
The main idea is that the row operations changed the augmented matrices,
but we also know how to change a matrix M by multiplying it by some other
matrix E, so that M → EM . In particular can we find ‘‘elementary matrices’’
the perform row operations?
Once we find these elementary matrices is is very important to ask how they
effect the determinant, but you can think about that for your own self right
now.
Lets tabulate our names for the matrices that perform the various row
operations:

Elementary Determinants
This video will show you how to calculate determinants of elementary matrices.
First remember that the job of an elementary row matrix is to perform row
operations, so that if E is an elementary row matrix and M some given matrix,
EM
is the matrix M with a row operation performed on it.
The next thing to remember is that the determinant of the identity is 1.
Moreover, we also know what row operations do to determinants:
• Row swap Eji : flips the sign of the determinant.
• Scalar multiplication Ri (λ): multiplying a row by λ multiplies the determinant by λ.
• Row addition Sji (λ): adding some amount of one row to another does not
change the determinant.
The corresponding elementary matrices are obtained by performing exactly
these operations on the identity:

So to calculate their determinants, we just have to apply the above list
of what happens to the determinant of a matrix under row operations to the
determinant of the identity. This yields
det Eji = −1 ,

det Ri (λ) = λ ,

det Sji (λ) = 1 .

Determinants and Inverses
Lets figure out the relationship between determinants and invertibility. If
we have a system of equations M x = b and we have the inverse M −1 then if we
multiply on both sides we get x = M −1 M x = M −1 b. If the inverse exists we
can solve for x and get a solution that looks like a point.
So what could go wrong when we want solve a system of equations and get a
solution that looks like a point? Something would go wrong if we didn’t have
enough equations for example if we were just given
x+y =1
or maybe, to make this a square matrix M we could write this as
x+y =1
0=0


1 1
and det(M ) = 0. When we compute the
0 0
determinant, this row of all zeros gets multiplied in every term. If instead
we were given redundant equations
The matrix for this would be M =

x+y =1
2x + 2y = 2


1 1
The matrix for this would be M =
and det(M ) = 0. But we know that

of all zeros. Somehow the determinant is able to detect that there is only one
equation here. Even if we had a set of contradictory set of equations such as
x+y =1
2x + 2y = 0,
where it is not possible for both of these equations to be true, the matrix M
is still the same, and still has a determinant zero.
Lets look at a three by three example, where the third equation is the sum
of the first two equations.
x+y+z =1
y+z =1
x + 2y + 2z = 2

and the matrix for this is

And we would be stuck here. The last row of all zeros cannot be converted
into the bottom row of a 3 × 3 identity matrix. this matrix has no inverse,
and the row of all zeros ensures that the determinant will be zero. It can
be difficult to see when one of the rows of a matrix is a linear combination
of the others, and what makes the determinant a useful tool is that with this
reasonably simple computation we can find out if the matrix is invertible, and
if the system will have a solution of a single point or column vector.

Alternative Proof
Here we will prove more directly that the determinant of a product of matrices
is the product of their determinants. First we reference that for a matrix
M with rows ri , if M 0 is the matrix with rows rj0 = rj + λri for j 6= i and
ri0 = ri , then det(M ) = det(M 0 ) Essentially we have M 0 as M multiplied by the
elementary row sum matrices Sji (λ). Hence we can create an upper-triangular
matrix U such that det(M ) = det(U ) by first using the first row to set m1i 7→ 0
for all i > 1, then iteratively (increasing k by 1 each time) for fixed k using
the k-th row to set mki 7→ 0 for all i > k.

400

Now note that for two upper-triangular matrices U = (uji ) and U 0 = (u0j
i ),
by matrix multiplication we have X = U U 0 = (xji ) is upper-triangular and
would contain a lower diagonal entry
xii = uii u0i
i . Also since every permutation
Q
(which is 0) have det(U ) = i uii . Let A and A0 have corresponding uppertriangular matrices U and U 0 respectively (i.e. det(A) = det(U )), we note
that AA0 has a corresponding upper-triangular matrix U U 0 , and hence we have
det(AA0 ) = det(U U 0 ) =

For 2 × 2 matrices we have a formula

a
det

= ad − bc .

This formula might be easier to remember if you think about this picture.

Now we can look at three by three matrices and see a few ways to compute
the determinant. We have a similar pattern for 3 × 3 matrices. Consider the
example

1
det 3
0

2



2 = ((1 · 1 · 1) + (2 · 2 · 0) + (3 · 3 · 0)) − ((3 · 1 · 0) + (1 · 2 · 0) + (3 · 2 · 1)) = −5
1

We can draw a picture with similar diagonals to find the terms that will be
positive and the terms that will be negative.

Another way to compute the determinant of a matrix is to use this recursive
formula. Here I take the coefficients of the first row and multiply them by
the determinant of the minors and the cofactor. Then we can use the formula
for a two by two determinant to compute the determinant of the minors


to compute them in a lot of problems.

Hint for Review Problem 5
For an arbitrary 3 × 3 matrix A = (aij ), we have
det(A) = a11 a22 a33 + a12 a23 a31 + a13 a21 a32 − a11 a23 a32 − a12 a21 a33 − a13 a22 a31
and so the complexity is 5a + 12m. Now note that in general, the complexity

cn = (n − 1)a + ncn−1 m

Subspaces and Spanning Sets

Linear systems as spanning sets
Suppose that we were given a set of linear equations lj (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) and we
want to find out if lj (X) = v j for all j for some vector V = (v j ). We know that
we can express this as the matrix equation
X

lij xi = v j

i

where lij is the coefficient of the variable xi in the equation lj . However, this
is also stating that V is in the span of the vectors {Li }i where Li = (lij )j . For
example, consider the set of equations
2x + 3y − z = 5
−x + 3y + z = 1
x + y − 2z = 3
which corresponds to the matrix equation

For the first part, try drawing an example in R3 :

403

404

Here we have taken the subspace W to be a plane through the origin and U to
be a line through the origin. The hint now is to think about what happens when
you add a vector u ∈ U to a vector w ∈ W . Does this live in the union U ∪ W ?
For the second part, we take a more theoretical approach. Lets suppose
that v ∈ U ∩ W and v 0 ∈ U ∩ W . This implies
v∈U

and

v0 ∈ U .

So, since U is a subspace and all subspaces are vector spaces, we know that
the linear combination
αv + βv 0 ∈ U .
Now repeat the same logic for W and you will be nearly done.

The example asks whether they are linearly independent, and the answer is
immediate: NO, four vectors can never be linearly independent in R3 . This
vector space is simply not big enough for that, but you need to understand the

G.9 Linear Independence

notion of the dimension of a vector space to see why. So we think the vectors
v1 , v2 , v3 and v4 are linearly dependent, which means we need to show that there
is a solution to
α1 v1 + α2 v2 + α3 v3 + α4 v4 = 0
for the numbers α1 , α2 , α3 and α4 not all vanishing.
To find this solution we need to set up a linear system. Writing out the
above linear combination gives

Since there are only zeros on the right hand column, we can drop it. Now we

In fact this is not just one relation, but infinitely many, for any choice of
µ, ν. The relationship quoted in the notes is just one of those choices.
Finally, since the vectors v1 , v2 , v3 and v4 are linearly dependent, we
can try to eliminate some of them. The pattern here is to keep the vectors
that correspond to columns with pivots. For example, setting µ = −1 (say) and
ν = 0 in the above allows us to solve for v3 while µ = 0 and ν = −1 (say) gives
v4 , explicitly we get
v3 =

Worked Proof
Here we will work through a quick version of the proof P
of Theorem 10.1.1. Let
i
{vi } denote a set of linearly dependent vectors, so
i c vi = 0 where there
k
exists some c 6= 0. Now without loss of generality we order our vectors such
that c1 6= 0, and we can do so since addition is commutative (i.e. a + b = b + a).
Therefore we have
c1 v1 = −

n

v1 = −

and we note that this argument is completely reversible since every ci 6= 0 is
invertible and 0/ci = 0.

Hint for Review Problem 1
Lets first remember how Z2 works. The only two elements are 1 and 0. Which
means when you add 1 + 1 you get 0. It also means when you have a vector ~v ∈ B n
and you want to multiply it by a scalar, your only choices are 1 and 0. This
is kind of neat because it means that the possibilities are finite, so we can
look at an entire vector space.
Now lets think about B 3 there is choice you have to make for each coordinate, you can either put a 1 or a 0, there are three places where you
have to make a decision between two things. This means that you have 23 = 8
possibilities for vectors in B 3 .
When you want to think about finding a set S that will span B 3 and is
linearly independent, you want to think about how many vectors you need. You
will need you have enough so that you can make every vector in B 3 using linear
combinations of elements in S but you don’t want too many so that some of
them are linear combinations of each other. I suggest trying something really
simple perhaps something that looks like the columns of the identity matrix
For part (c) you have to show that you can write every one of the elements
as a linear combination of the elements in S, this will check to make sure S
actually spans B 3 .
For part (d) if you have two vectors that you think will span the space,
you can prove that they do by repeating what you did in part (c), check that
every vector can be written using only copies of of these two vectors. If you
don’t think it will work you should show why, perhaps using an argument that
counts the number of possible vectors in the span of two vectors.

Basis and Dimension

Proof Explanation
Lets walk through the proof of theorem 11.0.1. We want to show that for
S = {v1 , . . . , vn } a basis for a vector space V , then every vector w ∈ V can be
written uniquely as a linear combination of vectors in the basis S:
w = c1 v1 + · · · + cn vn .
We should remember that since S is a basis for V , we know two things
• V = span S
• v1 , . . . , vn are linearly independent, which means that whenever we have
a1 v1 + . . . + an vn = 0 this implies that ai = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , n.
This first fact makes it easy to say that there exist constants ci such that
w = c1 v1 + · · · + cn vn . What we don’t yet know is that these c1 , . . . cn are unique.
In order to show that these are unique, we will suppose that they are not,
and show that this causes a contradiction. So suppose there exists a second
set of constants di such that
w = d1 v1 + · · · + dn vn .
For this to be a contradiction we need to have ci 6= di for some i. Then look
what happens when we take the difference of these two versions of w:
0V

= w−w
=

(c1 v1 + · · · + cn vn ) − (d1 v1 + · · · + dn vn )

=

(c1 − d1 )v1 + · · · + (cn − dn )vn .

Since the vi ’s are linearly independent this implies that ci − di = 0 for all i,
this means that we cannot have ci 6= di , which is a contradiction.

Worked Example
In this video we will work through an example of how to extend a set of linearly
independent vectors to a basis. For fun, we will take the vector space
V = {(x, y, z, w)|x, y, z, w ∈ Z5 } .
This is like four dimensional space R4 except that the numbers can only be
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. This is like bits, but now the rule is
0 = 5.

The last four vectors are clearly a basis (make sure you understand this....)
and are called the canonical basis. We want to keep v1 and v2 but find a way to
turf out two of the vectors in the canonical basis leaving us a basis of four
vectors. To do that, we have to study linear independence, or in other words
a linear system problem defined by
0 = α1 e1 + α2 e2 + α3 v1 + α4 v2 + α5 e3 + α6 e4 .
We want to find solutions for the α0 s which allow us to determine two of the
e0 s. For that we use an augmented matrix

The pivots are underlined. The columns corresponding to non-pivot variables
are the ones that can be eliminated--their coefficients (the α’s) will be
arbitrary, so set them all to zero save for the one next to the vector you are
solving for which can be taken to be unity. Thus that vector can certainly be
expressed in terms of previous ones. Hence, altogether, our basis is

Finally, as a check, note that e1 = v1 + v2 which explains why we had to throw

Hint for Review Problem 2
Since there are two possible values for each entry, we have |B n | = 2n . We note
that dim B n = n as well. Explicitly we have B 1 = {(0), (1)} so there is only 1
basis for B 1 . Similarly we have

and so choosing any two non-zero vectors will form a basis. Now in general we
note that we can build up a basis {ei } by arbitrarily (independently) choosing
the first i − 1 entries, then setting the i-th entry to 1 and all higher entries
to 0.

Remember that an eigenvector v with eigenvalue λ for M will be a vector such
that M v = λv i.e. M (v) − λI(v) = ~0. When we are talking about a nonzero v
then this means that det(M − λI) = 0. We will start by finding the eigenvalues
that make this statement true. First we compute

so det(M − λI) = (4 − λ)(3 − λ) − 2 · 1. We set this equal to zero to find values
of λ that make this true:
(4 − λ)(3 − λ) − 2 · 1 = 10 − 7λ + λ2 = (2 − λ)(5 − λ) = 0 .
This means that λ = 2 and λ = 5 are solutions. Now if we want to find the
eigenvectors that correspond to these values we look at vectors v such that

and we note that we can just read off the eigenvector e1 with eigenvalue λ.
However the characteristic polynomial of J2 is PJ2 (µ) = (µ − λ)2 so the only
possible eigenvalue is λ, but we claim it does not have a second eigenvector
v. To see this, we require that
λv 1 + v 2 = λv 1
λv 2 = λv 2
which clearly implies that v 2 = 0. This is known as a Jordan 2-cell, and in
general, a Jordan n-cell with eigenvalue λ is (similar to) the n × n matrix

and we see that PM (λ) = (λ − 3)2 (λ − 2). Therefore for λ = 3 we need to find the
solutions to (M − 3I3 )v = 0 or in equation form:
v2 = 0
v3 = 0
−v 3 = 0,
and we immediately see that we must have V = e1 . Next for λ = 2, we need to
solve (M − 2I3 )v = 0 or
v1 + v2 = 0
v2 + v3 = 0
0 = 0,
and thus we choose v 1 = 1, which implies v 2 = −1 and v 3 = 1. Hence this is the
only other eigenvector for M .
This is a specific case of Problem 13.7.

Eigenvalues
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are extremely important. In this video we review
the theory of eigenvalues. Consider a linear transformation
L : V −→ V

411

412

Movie Scripts
where dim V = n < ∞. Since V is finite dimensional, we can represent L by a
square matrix M by choosing a basis for V .
So the eigenvalue equation
Lv = λv
becomes
M v = λv,
where v is a column vector and M is an n×n matrix (both expressed in whatever
basis we chose for V ). The scalar λ is called an eigenvalue of M and the job
of this video is to show you how to find all the eigenvalues of M .
The first step is to put all terms on the left hand side of the equation,
this gives
(M − λI)v = 0 .
Notice how we used the identity matrix I in order to get a matrix times v
equaling zero. Now here comes a VERY important fact
N u = 0 and u 6= 0 ⇐⇒ det N = 0.

I.e., a square matrix can have an eigenvector with vanishing eigenvalue if and only if its
determinant vanishes! Hence
det(M − λI) = 0.

The quantity on the left (up to a possible minus sign) equals the so-called
characteristic polynomial
PM (λ) := det(λI − M ) .
It is a polynomial of degree n in the variable λ. To see why, try a simple
2 × 2 example

c d

which is clearly a polynomial of order 2 in λ. For the n × n case, the order n
term comes from the product of diagonal matrix elements also.
There is an amazing fact about polynomials called the fundamental theorem
of algebra: they can always be factored over complex numbers. This means that

412

G.11 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

413

degree n polynomials have n complex roots (counted with multiplicity). The
word can does not mean that explicit formulas for this are known (in fact
explicit formulas can only be give for degree four or less). The necessity
for complex numbers is easily seems from a polynomial like
z2 + 1
whose roots would require us to solve z 2 = −1 which is impossible for real
number z. However, introducing the imaginary unit i with
i2 = −1 ,
we have
z 2 + 1 = (z − i)(z + i) .
Returning to our characteristic polynomial, we call on the fundamental theorem
of algebra to write
PM (λ) = (λ − λ1 )(λ − λ2 ) · · · (λ − λn ) .
The roots λ1 , λ2 ,...,λn are the eigenvalues of M (or its underlying linear
transformation L).

By computing the determinant and solving for λ we can find the eigenvalues λ =

to find these for yourself.
When we think about the question in part (b) which asks to find a vector
v(0) such that v(0) = v(1) = v(2) . . ., we must look for a vector that satisfies
v = M v. What eigenvalue does this correspond to? If you found a v(0) with
this property would cv(0) for a scalar c also work? Remember that eigenvectors
have to be nonzero, so what if c = 0?
For part (c) if we tried an eigenvector would we have restrictions on what
the eigenvalue should be? Think about what it means to be pointed in the same
direction.

which is in the basis {n−1 xn }n (where for n = 0, we just have 1). Therefore
we note that 1 (constant polynomials) is the only eigenvector with eigenvalue
0 for polynomials since they have finite degree, and so the derivative is
not diagonalizable. Note that we are ignoring infinite cases for simplicity,
but if you want to consider infinite terms such as convergent series or all
formal power series where there is no conditions on convergence, there are
many eigenvectors. Can you find some? This is an example of how things can
change in infinite dimensional spaces.
For a more finite example, consider the space PC
3 of complex polynomials of
degree at most 3, and recall that the derivative D can be written as


0

You can easily check that the only eigenvector is 1 with eigenvalue 0 since D
always lowers the degree of a polynomial by 1 each time it is applied. Note
that this is a nilpotent matrix since D4 = 0, but the only nilpotent matrix
that is ‘‘diagonalizable’’ is the 0 matrix.

Change of Basis Example
This video returns to the example of a barrel filled with fruit

415

as a demonstration of changing basis.
Since this was a linear systems problem, we can try to represent what’s in
the barrel using a vector space. The first representation was the one where
(x, y) = (apples, oranges):

Oranges
(x, y)

Apples

Calling the basis vectors ~e1 := (1, 0) and ~e2 := (0, 1), this representation would
label what’s in the barrel by a vector
~x := x~e1 + y~e2 = ~e1

~e2

 
 x
.
y

Since this is the method ordinary people would use, we will call this the
‘‘engineer’s’’ method!
But this is not the approach nutritionists would use. They would note the
amount of sugar and total number of fruit (s, f ):

416

G.12 Diagonalization

417

fruit
(s, f )

sugar

WARNING: To make sense of what comes next you need to allow for the possibity
of a negative amount of fruit or sugar. This would be just like a bank, where
if money is owed to somebody else, we can use a minus sign.
The vector ~x says what is in the barrel and does not depend which mathematical description is employed. The way nutritionists label ~x is in terms of
a pair of basis vectors f~1 and f~2 :

  s
~
~
~
~
~x = sf1 + f f2 = f1 f2
.
f
Thus our vector space now has a bunch of interesting vectors:

The vector ~x labels generally the contents of the barrel. The vector ~e1 corresponds to one apple and one orange. The vector ~e2 is one orange and no apples.
The vector f~1 means one unit of sugar and zero total fruit (to achieve this
you could lend out some apples and keep a few oranges). Finally the vector f~2
represents a total of one piece of fruit and no sugar.
You might remember that the amount of sugar in an apple is called λ while
oranges have twice as much sugar as apples. Thus

s = λ (x + 2y)
f = x+y.

and

Of course, we must have
Q = P −1 ,
(which is in fact how we constructed P in the first place).
Finally, lets consider the very first linear systems problem, where you
were given that there were 27 pieces of fruit in total and twice as many oranges
as apples. In equations this says just
x + y = 27

and

2x − y = 0 .

for some θ ∈ [0, 2π). Now first we need to show that for a fixed θ that the pair
is orthogonal:
eθ1 eθ2 = − sin θ cos θ + cos θ sin θ = 0.
Also we have
keθ1 k2 = keθ2 k2 = sin2 θ + cos2 θ = 1,
and hence {eθ1 , eθ2 } is an orthonormal basis. To show that every orthonormal
basis of R2 is {eθ1 , eθ2 } for some θ, consider an orthonormal basis {b1 , b2 } and
note that b1 forms an angle φ with the vector e1 (which is e01 ). Thus b1 = eφ1 and
if b2 = eφ2 , we are done, otherwise b2 = −eφ2 and it is the reflected version.
However we can do the same thing except starting with b2 and get b2 = eψ
1 and

b1 = e2 since we have just interchanged two basis vectors which corresponds to
a reflection which picks up a minus sign as in the determinant.

Now v1⊥ , v2⊥ , v3⊥ , and v4⊥ are an orthogonal basis. Notice that even with very,
very nice looking vectors we end up having to do quite a bit of arithmetic.
This a good reason to use programs like matlab to check your work.

Another QR Decomposition Example
We can alternatively think of the QR decomposition as performing the GramSchmidt procedure on the column space, the vector space of the column vectors
of the matrix, of the matrix M . The resulting orthonormal basis will be
stored in Q and the negative of the coefficients will be recorded in R. Note
that R is upper triangular by how Gram-Schmidt works. Here we will explicitly
do an example with the matrix


 

M = m1 m2 m3  =  0 1

Overview
This video depicts the ideas of a subspace sum, a direct sum and an orthogonal
complement in R3 . Firstly, lets start with the subspace sum. Remember that
even if U and V are subspaces, their union U ∪ V is usually not a subspace.
However, the span of their union certainly is and is called the subspace sum
U + V = span(U ∪ V ) .
You need to be aware that this is a sum of vector spaces (not vectors). A
picture of this is a pair of planes in R3 :

Here U + V = R3 .
Next lets consider a direct sum. This is just the subspace sum for the
case when U ∩ V = {0}. For that we can keep the plane U but must replace V by
a line:

424

G.13 Orthonormal Bases and Complements

425

Taking a direct sum we again get the whole space, U ⊕ V = R3 .
Now we come to an orthogonal complement. There is not really a notion of
subtraction for subspaces but the orthogonal complement comes close. Given U
it provides a space U ⊥ such that the direct sum returns the whole space:
U ⊕ U ⊥ = R3 .
The orthogonal complement U ⊥ is the subspace made from all vectors perpendicular to any vector in U . Here, we need to just tilt the line V above until
it hits U at a right angle:

Notice, we can apply the same operation to U ⊥ and just get U back again, i.e.
⊥
U⊥ = U .

Hint for Review Question 2
You are asked to consider an orthogonal basis {v1 , v2 , . . . vn }. Because this is a
basis any v ∈ V can be uniquely expressed as
v = c1 v1 + c2 v2 + · · · + v n cn ,
and the number n = dim V . Since this is an orthogonal basis
vi v j = 0 ,

i 6= j .

So different vectors in the basis are orthogonal:

425

426

Movie Scripts
However, the basis is not orthonormal so we know nothing about the lengths of
the basis vectors (save that they cannot vanish).
To complete the hint, lets use the dot product to compute a formula for c1
in terms of the basis vectors and v. Consider
v1 v = c 1 v1 v1 + c 2 v1 v 2 + · · · + c n v1 vn = c 1 v1 v1 .
Solving for c1 (remembering that v1 v1 6= 0) gives
c1 =

v1 v
.
v1 v1

This should get you started on this problem.

Hint for Review Problem 3
Lets work part by part:
(a) Is the vector v ⊥ = v −

u·v
u·u u

in the plane P ?

Remember that the dot product gives you a scalar not a vector, so if you
u·v
is a scalar, so this is a linear combination
think about this formula u·u
of v and u. Do you think it is in the span?
(b) What is the angle between v ⊥ and u?
This part will make more sense if you think back to the dot product formulas you probably first saw in multivariable calculus. Remember that
u · v = kukkvk cos(θ),
and in particular if they are perpendicular θ =
get u · v = 0.

π

and cos( π2 ) = 0 you will

Now try to compute the dot product of u and v ⊥ to find kukkv⊥ k cos(θ)

Now you finish simplifying and see if you can figure out what θ has to be.
(c) Given your solution to the above, how can you find a third vector perpendicular to both u and v ⊥ ?
Remember what other things you learned in multivariable calculus? This
might be a good time to remind your self what the cross product does.

426

G.13 Orthonormal Bases and Complements

427

(d) Construct an orthonormal basis for R3 from u and v.
If you did part (c) you can probably find 3 orthogonal vectors to make
a orthogonal basis. All you need to do to turn this into an orthonormal
basis is make these into unit vectors.
(e) Test your abstract formulae starting with

u = 1 2 0 and v = 0

Try it out, and if you get stuck try drawing a sketch of the vectors you
have.

Hint for Review Problem 10
This video shows you a way to solve problem 10 that’s different to the method
described in the Lecture. The first thing is to think of


1 0 2
M = −1 2 0
−1 2 2
as a set of 3 vectors

0
v1 = −1 ,
−1



0
v2 =  2 ,
−2


 
2
v3 = 0 .
2

Then you need to remember that we are searching for a decomposition
M = QR
where Q is an orthogonal matrix. Thus the upper triangular matrix R = QT M
and QT Q = I. Moreover, orthogonal matrices perform rotations. To see this
compare the inner product u v = uT v of vectors u and v with that of Qu and
Qv:
(Qu) (Qv) = (Qu)T (Qv) = uT QT Qv = uT v = u v .
Since the dot product doesn’t change, we learn that Q does not change angles
or lengths of vectors.
Now, here’s an interesting procedure: rotate v1 , v2 and v3 such that v1 is
along the x-axis, v2 is in the xy-plane. Then if you put these in a matrix you
get something of the form


a b c
0 d e
0 0 f
which is exactly what we want for R!

427

428

Moreover, the vector
 
a
0
0
is the rotated v1 so must have length ||v1 || =
The rotated v2 is
 
b
d
0

√

3. Thus a =

and must have length ||v2 || = 2 2. Also the dot product between
 
 
a
b
0 and d

is ab and must equal v1 v2 = 0. (That v1 and v2 were orthogonal is just a
coincidence here... .) Thus b = 0. So now we know most of the matrix R

You can work out the last column using the same ideas. Thus it only remains to

If we want to diagonalize this matrix, we should be happy to see that it
is symmetric, since this means we will have real eigenvalues, which means
factoring won’t be too hard. As an added bonus if we have three distinct
eigenvalues the eigenvectors we find will automatically be orthogonal, which
means that the inverse of the matrix P will be easy to compute. We can start

=

((1 − 4) − 2λ + λ2 )(5 − λ)

=

(−3 − 2λ + λ2 )(5 − λ)

=

So we get λ = −1, 3, 5 as eigenvectors.

Notice that the eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis. We can create an
orthonormal basis by rescaling to make them unit vectors. This will help us

because if P = [v1 , v2 , v3 ] is created from orthonormal vectors then P −1 = P T ,
which means computing P −1 should be easy. So lets say

Invertibility Conditions
Here I am going to discuss some of the conditions on the invertibility of a
matrix stated in Theorem 16.3.1. Condition 1 states that X = M −1 V uniquely,
which is clearly equivalent to 4. Similarly, every square matrix M uniquely

430

G.15 Kernel, Range, Nullity, Rank

431

corresponds to a linear transformation L : Rn → Rn , so condition 3 is equivalent to condition 1.
Condition 6 implies 4 by the adjoint construct the inverse, but the converse is not so obvious. For the converse (4 implying 6), we refer back the
proofs in Chapter 18 and 19. Note that if det M = 0, there exists an eigenvalue of M equal to 0, which implies M is not invertible. Thus condition 8
is equivalent to conditions 4, 5, 9, and 10.
The map M is injective if it does not have a null space by definition,
however eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0 form a basis for the null space. Hence
conditions 8 and 14 are equivalent, and 14, 15, and 16 are equivalent by the
Dimension Formula (also known as the Rank-Nullity Theorem).
Now conditions 11, 12, and 13 are all equivalent by the definition of a
basis. Finally if a matrix M is not row-equivalent to the identity matrix,
then det M = 0, so conditions 2 and 8 are equivalent.

Hint for Review Problem 2
Lets work through this problem.
Let L : V → W be a linear transformation. Show that ker L = {0V } if and
only if L is one-to-one:
1. First, suppose that ker L = {0V }. Show that L is one-to-one.
Remember what one-one means, it means whenever L(x) = L(y) we can be
certain that x = y. While this might seem like a weird thing to require
this statement really means that each vector in the range gets mapped to
a unique vector in the range.
We know we have the one-one property, but we also don’t want to forget
some of the more basic properties of linear transformations namely that
they are linear, which means L(ax + by) = aL(x) + bL(y) for scalars a and
b.
What if we rephrase the one-one property to say whenever L(x) − L(y) = 0
implies that x − y = 0? Can we connect that to the statement that ker L =
{0V }? Remember that if L(v) = 0 then v ∈ ker L = {0V }.
2. Now, suppose that L is one-to-one. Show that ker L = {0V }. That is, show
that 0V is in ker L, and then show that there are no other vectors in
ker L.
What would happen if we had a nonzero kernel? If we had some vector v
with L(v) = 0 and v 6= 0, we could try to show that this would contradict
the given that L is one-one. If we found x and y with L(x) = L(y), then
we know x = y. But if L(v) = 0 then L(x) + L(v) = L(y). Does this cause a
problem?

Least Squares and Singular Values

Least Squares: Hint for Review Problem 1
Lets work through this problem. Let L : U → V be a linear transformation.
Suppose v ∈ L(U ) and you have found a vector ups that obeys L(ups ) = v.
Explain why you need to compute ker L to describe the solution space of the
linear system L(u) = v.
Remember the property of linearity that comes along with any linear transformation: L(ax + by) = aL(x) + bL(y) for scalars a and b. This allows us to
break apart and recombine terms inside the transformation.
Now suppose we have a solution x where L(x) = v. If we have an vector
y ∈ ker L then we know L(y) = 0. If we add the equations together L(x) + L(y) =
L(x + y) = v + 0 we get another solution for free. Now we have two solutions,
is that all?

Hint for Review Problem 2
For the first part, what is the transpose of a 1 × 1 matrix? For the other two
parts, note that v v = v T v. Can you express this in terms of kvk? Also you
need the trivial kernel only for the last part and just think about the null
space of M . It might help to substitute w = M x.
