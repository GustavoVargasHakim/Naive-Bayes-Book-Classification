Preface
This book covers calculus in two and three variables. It is suitable for a one-semester course,
normally known as “Vector Calculus”, “Multivariable Calculus”, or simply “Calculus III”.
The prerequisites are the standard courses in single-variable calculus (a.k.a. Calculus I and
II).
I have tried to be somewhat rigorous about proving results. But while it is important for
students to see full-blown proofs - since that is how mathematics works - too much rigor and
emphasis on proofs can impede the flow of learning for the vast majority of the audience at
this level. If I were to rate the level of rigor in the book on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being
completely informal and 10 being completely rigorous, I would rate it as a 5.
There are 420 exercises throughout the text, which in my experience are more than
enough for a semester course in this subject. There are exercises at the end of each section, divided into three categories: A, B and C. The A exercises are mostly of a routine
computational nature, the B exercises are slightly more involved, and the C exercises usually require some effort or insight to solve. A crude way of describing A, B and C would be
“Easy”, “Moderate” and “Challenging”, respectively. However, many of the B exercises are
easy and not all the C exercises are difficult.
There are a few exercises that require the student to write his or her own computer program to solve some numerical approximation problems (e.g. the Monte Carlo method for
approximating multiple integrals, in Section 3.4). The code samples in the text are in the
Java programming language, hopefully with enough comments so that the reader can figure
out what is being done even without knowing Java. Those exercises do not mandate the use
of Java, so students are free to implement the solutions using the language of their choice.
While it would have been simple to use a scripting language like Python, and perhaps even
easier with a functional programming language (such as Haskell or Scheme), Java was chosen due to its ubiquity, relatively clear syntax, and easy availability for multiple platforms.
Answers and hints to most odd-numbered and some even-numbered exercises are provided in Appendix A. Appendix B contains a proof of the right-hand rule for the cross product, which seems to have virtually disappeared from calculus texts over the last few decades.
Appendix C contains a brief tutorial on Gnuplot for graphing functions of two variables.

1 Vectors in Euclidean Space
1.1 Introduction
In single-variable calculus, the functions that one encounters are functions of a variable
(usually x or t) that varies over some subset of the real number line (which we denote by R).
For such a function, say, y = f ( x), the graph of the function f consists of the points ( x, y) =
( x, f ( x)). These points lie in the Euclidean plane, which, in the Cartesian or rectangular
coordinate system, consists of all ordered pairs of real numbers (a, b). We use the word
“Euclidean” to denote a system in which all the usual rules of Euclidean geometry hold. We
denote the Euclidean plane by R2 ; the “2” represents the number of dimensions of the plane.
The Euclidean plane has two perpendicular coordinate axes: the x-axis and the y-axis.
In vector (or multivariable) calculus, we will deal with functions of two or three variables
(usually x, y or x, y, z, respectively). The graph of a function of two variables, say, z = f ( x, y),
lies in Euclidean space, which in the Cartesian coordinate system consists of all ordered
triples of real numbers (a, b, c). Since Euclidean space is 3-dimensional, we denote it by R3 .
The graph of f consists of the points ( x, y, z) = ( x, y, f ( x, y)). The 3-dimensional coordinate
system of Euclidean space can be represented on a flat surface, such as this page or a blackboard, only by giving the illusion of three dimensions, in the manner shown in Figure 1.1.1.
Euclidean space has three mutually perpendicular coordinate axes ( x, y and z), and three
mutually perpendicular coordinate planes: the x y-plane, yz-plane and xz-plane (see Figure
1.1.2).

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

The coordinate system shown in Figure 1.1.1 is known as a right-handed coordinate
system, because it is possible, using the right hand, to point the index finger in the positive
direction of the x-axis, the middle finger in the positive direction of the y-axis, and the thumb
in the positive direction of the z-axis, as in Figure 1.1.3.

Right-handed coordinate system

An equivalent way of defining a right-handed system is if you can point your thumb upwards in the positive z-axis direction while using the remaining four fingers to rotate the
x-axis towards the y-axis. Doing the same thing with the left hand is what defines a lefthanded coordinate system. Notice that switching the x- and y-axes in a right-handed
system results in a left-handed system, and that rotating either type of system does not
change its “handedness”. Throughout the book we will use a right-handed system.
For functions of three variables, the graphs exist in 4-dimensional space (i.e. R4 ), which
we can not see in our 3-dimensional space, let alone simulate in 2-dimensional space. So
we can only think of 4-dimensional space abstractly. For an entertaining discussion of this
subject, see the book by A BBOTT.1
So far, we have discussed the position of an object in 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional space.
But what about something such as the velocity of the object, or its acceleration? Or the
gravitational force acting on the object? These phenomena all seem to involve motion and
direction in some way. This is where the idea of a vector comes in.

1 One thing you will learn is why a 4-dimensional creature would be able to reach inside an egg and remove the
yolk without cracking the shell!

1.1 Introduction

3

You have already dealt with velocity and acceleration in single-variable calculus. For
example, for motion along a straight line, if y = f ( t) gives the displacement of an object after
time t, then d y/ dt = f ′ ( t) is the velocity of the object at time t. The derivative f ′ ( t) is just a
number, which is positive if the object is moving in an agreed-upon “positive” direction, and
negative if it moves in the opposite of that direction. So you can think of that number, which
was called the velocity of the object, as having two components: a magnitude, indicated
by a nonnegative number, preceded by a direction, indicated by a plus or minus symbol
(representing motion in the positive direction or the negative direction, respectively), i.e.
f ′ ( t) = ±a for some number a ≥ 0. Then a is the magnitude of the velocity (normally called
the speed of the object), and the ± represents the direction of the velocity (though the + is
usually omitted for the positive direction).
For motion along a straight line, i.e. in a 1-dimensional space, the velocities are also contained in that 1-dimensional space, since they are just numbers. For general motion along a
curve in 2- or 3-dimensional space, however, velocity will need to be represented by a multidimensional object which should have both a magnitude and a direction. A geometric object
which has those features is an arrow, which in elementary geometry is called a “directed line
segment”. This is the motivation for how we will define a vector.
Definition 1.1. A (nonzero) vector is a directed line segment drawn from a point P (called
its initial point) to a point Q (called its terminal point), with P and Q being distinct
−−→
points. The vector is denoted by PQ . Its magnitude is the length of the line segment,
° −−→ °
denoted by ° PQ °, and its direction is the same as that of the directed line segment. The
zero vector is just a point, and it is denoted by 0.
To indicate the direction of a vector, we draw an arrow from its initial point to its terminal
point. We will often denote a vector by a single bold-faced letter (e.g. v) and use the terms
“magnitude” and “length” interchangeably. Note that our definition could apply to systems
with any number of dimensions (see Figure 1.1.4 (a)-(c)).

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

A few things need to be noted about the zero vector. Our motivation for what a vector is
included the notions of magnitude and direction. What is the magnitude of the zero vector?
We define it to be zero, i.e. k 0 k = 0. This agrees with the definition of the zero vector as just
a point, which has zero length. What about the direction of the zero vector? A single point
really has no well-defined direction. Notice that we were careful to only define the direction
of a nonzero vector, which is well-defined since the initial and terminal points are distinct.
Not everyone agrees on the direction of the zero vector. Some contend that the zero vector
has arbitrary direction (i.e. can take any direction), some say that it has indeterminate
direction (i.e. the direction can not be determined), while others say that it has no direction.
Our definition of the zero vector, however, does not require it to have a direction, and we will
leave it at that.2
Now that we know what a vector is, we need a way of determining when two vectors are
equal. This leads us to the following definition.
Definition 1.2. Two nonzero vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and the
same direction. Any vector with zero magnitude is equal to the zero vector.
By this definition, vectors with the same magnitude and direction but with different initial
points would
pbe equal. For example, in Figure 1.1.5 the vectors u, v and w all have the same
magnitude 5 (by the Pythagorean Theorem). And we see that u and w are parallel, since
they lie on lines having the same slope 21 , and they point in the same direction. So u = w,
even though they have different initial points. We also see that v is parallel to u but points
in the opposite direction. So u 6= v.

So we can see that there are an infinite number of vectors for a given magnitude and
direction, those vectors all being equal and differing only by their initial and terminal points.
Is there a single vector which we can choose to represent all those equal vectors? The answer
is yes, and is suggested by the vector w in Figure 1.1.5.
2 In the subject of linear algebra there is a more abstract way of defining a vector where the concept of “direction”
is not really used. See A NTON and R ORRES.

1.1 Introduction

5

Unless otherwise indicated, when speaking of “the vector” with a given magnitude and
direction, we will mean the one whose initial point is at the origin of the coordinate
system.
Thinking of vectors as starting from the origin provides a way of dealing with vectors in
a standard way, since every coordinate system has an origin. But there will be times when
it is convenient to consider a different initial point for a vector (for example, when adding
vectors, which we will do in the next section).
Another advantage of using the origin as the initial point is that it provides an easy correspondence between a vector and its terminal point.
Example 1.1. Let v be the vector in R3 whose initial point is at the origin and whose terminal point is (3, 4, 5). Though the point (3, 4, 5) and the vector v are different objects, it is
convenient to write v = (3, 4, 5). When doing this, it is understood that the initial point of v
is at the origin (0, 0, 0) and the terminal point is (3, 4, 5).

Figure 1.1.6 Correspondence between points and vectors

Unless otherwise stated, when we refer to vectors as v = (a, b) in R2 or v = (a, b, c) in R3 ,
we mean vectors in Cartesian coordinates starting at the origin. Also, we will write the zero
vector 0 in R2 and R3 as (0, 0) and (0, 0, 0), respectively.
The point-vector correspondence provides an easy way to check if two vectors are equal,
without having to determine their magnitude and direction. Similar to seeing if two points
are the same, you are now seeing if the terminal points of vectors starting at the origin
are the same. For each vector, find the (unique!) vector it equals whose initial point is
the origin. Then compare the coordinates of the terminal points of these “new” vectors: if
those coordinates are the same, then the original vectors are equal. To get the “new” vectors
starting at the origin, you translate each vector to start at the origin by subtracting the
coordinates of the original initial point from the original terminal point. The resulting point
will be the terminal point of the “new” vector whose initial point is the origin. Do this for
each original vector then compare.

Example 1.2. Consider the vectors PQ and RS in R3 , where P = (2, 1, 5),Q = (3, 5, 7), R =
−−→ −−→
(1, −3, −2) and S = (2, 1, 0). Does PQ = RS ?
−−→
Solution: The vector PQ is equal to the vector v with initial point (0, 0, 0) and terminal point
Q − P = (3, 5, 7) − (2, 1, 5) = (3 − 2, 5 − 1, 7 − 5) = (1, 4, 2).

Similarly, RS is equal to the vector w with initial point (0, 0, 0) and terminal point S − R =
(2, 1, 0) − (1, −3, −2) = (2 − 1, 1 − (−3), 0 − (−2)) = (1, 4, 2).

Recall the distance formula for points in the Euclidean plane:
For points P = ( x1 , y1 ), Q = ( x2 , y2 ) in R2 , the distance d between P and Q is:

d=

q
( x2 − x1 )2 + ( y2 − y1 )2

(1.1)

By this formula, we have the following result:

For a vector PQ in R2 with initial point P = ( x1 , y1 ) and terminal point

Q = ( x2 , y2 ), the magnitude of PQ is:

° PQ ° = ( x2 − x1 )2 + ( y2 − y1 )2

(1.2)

1.1 Introduction

7

Finding the magnitude of a vector v = (a, b) in R2 is a special case of formula (1.2) with
P = (0, 0) and Q = (a, b) :
For a vector v = (a, b) in R2 , the magnitude of v is:
kvk =

p

a2 + b 2

(1.3)

To calculate the magnitude of vectors in R3 , we need a distance formula for points in
Euclidean space (we will postpone the proof until the next section):
Theorem 1.1. The distance d between points P = ( x1 , y1 , z1 ) and Q = ( x2 , y2 , z2 ) in R3 is:

d=

q
( x2 − x1 )2 + ( y2 − y1 )2 + ( z2 − z1 )2

(1.4)

The proof will use the following result:
Theorem 1.2. For a vector v = (a, b, c) in R3 , the magnitude of v is:
kvk =

p

a2 + b 2 + c 2

(1.5)

Proof: There are four cases to consider:
p
p
Case 1: a = b = c = 0. Then v = 0, so k v k = 0 = 02 + 02 + 02 = a2 + b2 + c2 .
Case 2: exactly two of a, b, c are 0. Without loss of generality, we assume that a = b = 0 and
c 6= 0 (the other two possibilities are handled in a similar
Then v =p(0, 0, c), which
p
p manner).
2
2
is a vector of length | c | along the z-axis. So k v k = | c| = c = 0 + 02 + c2 = a2 + b2 + c2 .
Case 3: exactly one of a, b, c is 0. Without loss of generality, we assume that a = 0, b 6= 0
and c 6= 0 (the other two possibilities are handled in a similar manner). Then vp= (0, b, c),
2
2
which is a vector
p
p in the yz-plane, so by the Pythagorean Theorem we have k v k = b + c =
02 + b 2 + c 2 = a 2 + b 2 + c 2 .

1.2 Vector Algebra
Now that we know what vectors are, we can start to perform some of the usual algebraic
operations on them (e.g. addition, subtraction). Before doing that, we will introduce the
notion of a scalar.
Definition 1.3. A scalar is a quantity that can be represented by a single number.
For our purposes, scalars will always be real numbers.3 Examples of scalar quantities are
mass, electric charge, and speed (not velocity).4 We can now define scalar multiplication of
a vector.
Definition 1.4. For a scalar k and a nonzero vector v, the scalar multiple of v by k,
denoted by kv, is the vector whose magnitude is | k | k v k, points in the same direction as v if
k > 0, points in the opposite direction as v if k < 0, and is the zero vector 0 if k = 0. For the
zero vector 0, we define k0 = 0 for any scalar k.
Two vectors v and w are parallel (denoted by v ∥ w) if one is a scalar multiple of the other.
You can think of scalar multiplication of a vector as stretching or shrinking the vector, and
as flipping the vector in the opposite direction if the scalar is a negative number (see Figure
1.2.1).

Recall that translating a nonzero vector means that the initial point of the vector is
changed but the magnitude and direction are preserved. We are now ready to define the
sum of two vectors.
Definition 1.5. The sum of vectors v and w, denoted by v + w, is obtained by translating
w so that its initial point is at the terminal point of v; the initial point of v + w is the initial
point of v, and its terminal point is the new terminal point of w.
3 The term scalar was invented by 19th century Irish mathematician, physicist and astronomer William Rowan
Hamilton, to convey the sense of something that could be represented by a point on a scale or graduated ruler.
The word vector comes from Latin, where it means “carrier”.
4 An alternate definition of scalars and vectors, used in physics, is that under certain types of coordinate transformations (e.g. rotations), a quantity that is not affected is a scalar, while a quantity that is affected (in a
certain way) is a vector. See M ARION for details.

Notice that our definition is valid for the zero vector (which is just a point, and hence can
be translated), and so we see that v + 0 = v = 0 + v for any vector v. In particular, 0 + 0 = 0.
Also, it is easy to see that v + (−v) = 0, as we would expect. In general, since the scalar
multiple −v = −1 v is a well-defined vector, we can define vector subtraction as follows:
v − w = v + (−w). See Figure 1.2.3.

“Geometric” vector algebra

Notice that we have temporarily abandoned the practice of starting vectors at the origin.
In fact, we have not even mentioned coordinates in this section so far. Since we will deal
mostly with Cartesian coordinates in this book, the following two theorems are useful for
performing vector algebra on vectors in R2 and R3 starting at the origin.

1.2 Vector Algebra

Theorem 1.3. Let v = (v1 , v2 ), w = (w1 , w2 ) be vectors in R2 , and let k be a scalar. Then
(a) kv = ( kv1 , kv2 )
(b) v + w = (v1 + w1 , v2 + w2 )

Proof: (a) Without loss of generality, we assume that v1 , v2 > 0 (the other possibilities are
handled in a similar manner). If k = 0 then kv = 0v = 0 = (0, 0) = (0v1 , 0v2 ) = ( kv1 , kv2 ), which
v2
2
is what we needed to show. If k 6= 0, then ( kv1 , kv2 ) lies on a line with slope kv
kv1 = v1 , which
is the same as the slope of the line on which v (and hence kv) lies, and ( kv1 , kv2 ) points in
the same directionqon that line asq
kv. Also, by formula
q (1.3) the magnitude of ( kv1 , kv2 ) is
p
( kv1 )2 + ( kv2 )2 = k2 v12 + k2 v22 = k2 (v12 + v22 ) = | k | v12 + v22 = | k | k v k. So kv and ( kv1 , kv2 )
have the same magnitude and direction. This proves (a).
(b) Without loss of generality, we assume that
v1 , v2 , w1 , w2 > 0 (the other possibilities are handled in a similar manner). From Figure 1.2.5, we
see that when translating w to start at the end of
v, the new terminal point of w is (v1 + w1 , v2 + w2 ),
so by the definition of v + w this must be the terminal point of v + w. This proves (b).

proof for R2 is similar).

Let u = ( u 1 , u 2 , u 3 ), v = (v1 , v2 , v3 ), w = (w1 , w2 , w3 ) be vectors in R3 . Then
u + (v + w) = ( u 1 , u 2 , u 3 ) + ((v1 , v2 , v3 ) + (w1 , w2 , w3 ))

QED

A unit vector is a vector with magnitude 1. Notice that for any nonzero vector° v, the
°
vector k vv k is a unit vector which points in the same direction as v, since k v1 k > 0 and ° k vv k ° =
kvk
kvk

= 1. Dividing a nonzero vector v by k v k is often called normalizing v.
There are specific unit vectors which we will often use, called the basis vectors:
i = (1, 0, 0), j = (0, 1, 0), and k = (0, 0, 1) in R3 ; i = (1, 0) and j = (0, 1) in R2 .
These are useful for several reasons: they are mutually perpendicular, since they lie on
distinct coordinate axes; they are all unit vectors: k i k = k j k = k k k = 1; every vector can
be written as a unique scalar combination of the basis vectors: v = (a, b) = a i + b j in R2 ,
v = (a, b, c) = a i + b j + c k in R3 . See Figure 1.2.7.

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

We can now easily prove Theorem 1.1 from the previous section. The distance d between
two points P = ( x1 , y1 , z1 ) and Q = ( x2 , y2 , z2 ) in R3 is the same as the length of the vector w − v,
where the vectors v and w are defined as v = ( x1 , y1 , z1 ) and
p w = ( x2 , y2 , z2 ) (see Figure 1.2.8).
So since w − v = ( x2 − x1 , y2 − y1 , z2 − z1 ), then d = k w − v k = ( x2 − x1 )2 + ( y2 − y1 )2 + ( z2 − z1 )2 by

1.3 Dot Product

1.3 Dot Product
You may have noticed that while we did define multiplication of a vector by a scalar in the
previous section on vector algebra, we did not define multiplication of a vector by a vector.
We will now see one type of multiplication of vectors, called the dot product.
Definition 1.6. Let v = (v1 , v2 , v3 ) and w = (w1 , w2 , w3 ) be vectors in R3 .
The dot product of v and w, denoted by v · w, is given by:
v · w = v1 w1 + v2 w2 + v3 w3

(1.6)

Similarly, for vectors v = (v1 , v2 ) and w = (w1 , w2 ) in R2 , the dot product is:
v · w = v1 w1 + v2 w2

(1.7)

Notice that the dot product of two vectors is a scalar, not a vector. So the associative law
that holds for multiplication of numbers and for addition of vectors (see Theorem 1.5(b),(e)),
does not hold for the dot product of vectors. Why? Because for vectors u, v, w, the dot
product u · v is a scalar, and so (u · v) · w is not defined since the left side of that dot product
(the part in parentheses) is a scalar and not a vector.
For vectors v = v1 i + v2 j + v3 k and w = w1 i + w2 j + w3 k in component form, the dot product
is still v · w = v1 w1 + v2 w2 + v3 w3 .
Also notice that we defined the dot product in an analytic way, i.e. by referencing vector
coordinates. There is a geometric way of defining the dot product, which we will now develop
as a consequence of the analytic definition.
Definition 1.7. The angle between two nonzero vectors with the same initial point is the
smallest angle between them.
We do not define the angle between the zero vector and any other vector. Any two nonzero
vectors with the same initial point have two angles between them: θ and 360◦ − θ . We will
always choose the smallest nonnegative angle θ between them, so that 0◦ ≤ θ ≤ 180◦ . See
Figure 1.3.1.

Angle between vectors

We can now take a more geometric view of the dot product by establishing a relationship
between the dot product of two vectors and the angle between them.

(v1 , v2 , v3 ) and w = (w1 , w2 , w3 ). By the Law of Cosines (see Figure 1.3.2), we have
k v − w k2 = k v k2 + k w k2 − 2 k v k k w k cos θ

Two nonzero vectors are perpendicular if the angle between them is 90◦ . Since cos 90◦ =
0, we have the following important corollary to Theorem 1.6:
Corollary 1.7. Two nonzero vectors v and w are perpendicular if and only if v · w = 0.
We will write v ⊥ w to indicate that v and w are perpendicular.

1.3 Dot Product

17

Since cos θ > 0 for 0◦ ≤ θ < 90◦ and cos θ < 0 for 90◦ < θ ≤ 180◦ , we also have:

is positive, negative, or zero, respectively. See Figure 1.3.3.

(f) If either v = 0 or w = 0, then v · w = 0 by part (c), and so the inequality holds trivially. So
assume that v and w are nonzero vectors. Then by Theorem 1.6,
v · w = cos θ k v k k w k , so

| v · w | = | cos θ | k v k k w k , so

| v · w | ≤ k v k k w k since | cos θ | ≤ 1.

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

Using Theorem 1.9, we see that if u · v = 0 and u · w = 0, then u · ( kv + l w) = k(u · v)+ l (u · w) =
k(0) + l (0) = 0 for all scalars k, l . Thus, we have the following fact:
If u ⊥ v and u ⊥ w, then u ⊥ ( kv + l w) for all scalars k, l .
For vectors v and w, the collection of all scalar combinations kv + l w is called the span
of v and w. If nonzero vectors v and w are parallel, then their span is a line; if they are
not parallel, then their span is a plane. So what we showed above is that a vector which is
perpendicular to two other vectors is also perpendicular to their span.
The dot product can be used to derive properties of the magnitudes of vectors, the most
important of which is the Triangle Inequality, as given in the following theorem:
Theorem 1.10. For any vectors v, w, we have
(a) k v k2 = v · v
(b) k v + w k ≤ k v k + k w k
Triangle Inequality
(c) k v − w k ≥ k v k − k w k

Proof: (a) Left as an exercise for the reader.
(b) By part (a) and Theorem 1.9, we have
k v + w k2 = (v + w) · (v + w) = v · v + v · w + w · v + w · w

= k v k2 + 2(v · w) + k w k2 , so since a ≤ | a | for any real number a, we have

≤ k v k2 + 2 | v · w | + k w k2 , so by Theorem 1.9(f) we have
≤ k v k2 + 2 k v k k w k + k w k2 = (k v k + k w k)2 and so

k v + w k ≤ k v k + k w k after taking square roots of both sides, which proves (b).

(c) Since v = w + (v − w), then k v k = k w + (v − w) k ≤ k w k+k v − w k by the Triangle Inequality,
so subtracting k w k from both sides gives k v k − k w k ≤ k v − w k.
QED
The Triangle Inequality gets its name from the fact that in any triangle,
no one side is longer than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides (see
Figure 1.3.4). Another way of saying this is with the familiar statement “the
shortest distance between two points is a straight line.”

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

1.4 Cross Product
In Section 1.3 we defined the dot product, which gave a way of multiplying two vectors. The
resulting product, however, was a scalar, not a vector. In this section we will define a product
of two vectors that does result in another vector. This product, called the cross product, is
only defined for vectors in R3 . The definition may appear strange and lacking motivation,
but we will see the geometric basis for it shortly.
Definition 1.8. Let v = (v1 , v2 , v3 ) and w = (w1 , w2 , w3 ) be vectors in R3 . The cross product
of v and w, denoted by v × w, is the vector in R3 given by:
v × w = (v2 w3 − v3 w2 , v3 w1 − v1 w3 , v1 w2 − v2 w1 )

Similarly it can be shown that j × k = i and k × i = j.
In the above example, the cross product of the given vectors was perpendicular to both
those vectors. It turns out that this will always be the case.
Theorem 1.11. If the cross product v × w of two nonzero vectors v and w is also a nonzero
vector, then it is perpendicular to both v and w.
Proof: We will show that (v × w) · v = 0:
(v × w) · v = (v2 w3 − v3 w2 , v3 w1 − v1 w3 , v1 w2 − v2 w1 ) · (v1 , v2 , v3 )

= v2 w3 v1 − v3 w2 v1 + v3 w1 v2 − v1 w3 v2 + v1 w2 v3 − v2 w1 v3

= v1 v2 w3 − v1 v2 w3 + w1 v2 v3 − w1 v2 v3 + v1 w2 v3 − v1 w2 v3
= 0 , after rearranging the terms.

∴ v × w ⊥ v by Corollary 1.7.
The proof that v × w ⊥ w is similar.

QED

As a consequence of the above theorem and Theorem 1.9, we have the following:
Corollary 1.12. If the cross product v × w of two nonzero vectors v and w is also a nonzero
vector, then it is perpendicular to the span of v and w.

1.4 Cross Product

21

The span of any two nonzero, nonparallel vectors v, w in R3 is a plane P , so the above
corollary shows that v × w is perpendicular to that plane. As shown in Figure 1.4.2, there
are two possible directions for v × w, one the opposite of the other. It turns out (see Appendix
B) that the direction of v × w is given by the right-hand rule, that is, the vectors v, w, v × w
form a right-handed system. Recall from Section 1.1 that this means that you can point your
thumb upwards in the direction of v × w while rotating v towards w with the remaining four
fingers.

Direction of v × w

We will now derive a formula for the magnitude of v × w, for nonzero vectors v, w:
k v × w k2 = (v2 w3 − v3 w2 )2 + (v3 w1 − v1 w3 )2 + (v1 w2 − v2 w1 )2

= v22 w32 − 2v2 w2 v3 w3 + v32 w22 + v32 w12 − 2v1 w1 v3 w3 + v12 w32 + v12 w22 − 2v1 w1 v2 w2 + v22 w12
= v12 (w22 + w32 ) + v22 (w12 + w32 ) + v32 (w12 + w22 ) − 2(v1 w1 v2 w2 + v1 w1 v3 w3 + v2 w2 v3 w3 )

and now adding and subtracting v12 w12 , v22 w22 , and v32 w32 on the right side gives
= v12 (w12 + w22 + w32 ) + v22 (w12 + w22 + w32 ) + v32 (w12 + w22 + w32 )

− (v12 w12 + v22 w22 + v32 w32 + 2(v1 w1 v2 w2 + v1 w1 v3 w3 + v2 w2 v3 w3 ))

= (v12 + v22 + v32 )(w12 + w22 + w32 )

− ((v1 w1 )2 + (v2 w2 )2 + (v3 w3 )2 + 2(v1 w1 )(v2 w2 ) + 2(v1 w1 )(v3 w3 ) + 2(v2 w2 )(v3 w3 ))

so using (a + b + c)2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2 bc for the subtracted term gives
= (v12 + v22 + v32 )(w12 + w22 + w32 ) − (v1 w1 + v2 w2 + v3 w3 )2

= k v k2 k w k2 − (v · w)2
³
(v · w)2 ´
= k v k2 k w k2 1 −
, since k v k > 0 and k w k > 0, so by Theorem 1.6
k v k2 k w k2
= k v k2 k w k2 (1 − cos2 θ ) , where θ is the angle between v and w, so

k v × w k2 = k v k2 k w k2 sin2 θ , and since 0◦ ≤ θ ≤ 180◦ , then sin θ ≥ 0, so we have:

22

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

If θ is the angle between nonzero vectors v and w in R3 , then
k v × w k = k v k k w k sin θ

(1.11)

It may seem strange to bother with the above formula, when the magnitude of the cross
product can be calculated directly, like for any other vector. The formula is more useful for
its applications in geometry, as in the following example.
Example 1.8. Let △PQR and PQRS be a triangle and parallelogram, respectively, as shown
in Figure 1.4.3.

Think of the triangle as existing in R3 , and identify the sides QR and QP with vectors v
and w, respectively, in R3 . Let θ be the angle between v and w. The area A PQR of △PQR is
1
2 bh, where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height. So we see that

b = kvk

and

h = k w k sin θ

A PQR =

So since the area A PQRS of the parallelogram PQRS is twice the area of the triangle △PQR ,
then
A PQRS = k v k k w k sin θ
By the discussion in Example 1.8, we have proved the following theorem:
Theorem 1.13. Area of triangles and parallelograms
(a) The area A of a triangle with adjacent sides v, w (as vectors in R3 ) is:

A=

1
kv × wk
2

(b) The area A of a parallelogram with adjacent sides v, w (as vectors in R3 ) is:

A = kv × wk

1.4 Cross Product

23

It may seem at first glance that since the formulas derived in Example 1.8 were for the
adjacent sides QP and QR only, then the more general statements in Theorem 1.13 that the
formulas hold for any adjacent sides are not justified. We would get a different formula for
the area if we had picked PQ and PR as the adjacent sides, but it can be shown (see Exercise
26) that the different formulas would yield the same value, so the choice of adjacent sides
indeed does not matter, and Theorem 1.13 is valid.
Theorem 1.13 makes it simpler to calculate the area of a triangle in 3-dimensional space
than by using traditional geometric methods.
Example 1.9. Calculate the area of the triangle △PQR , where P = (2, 4, −7), Q = (3, 7, 18),

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

The following theorem summarizes the basic properties of the cross product.
Theorem 1.14. For any vectors u, v, w in R3 , and scalar k, we have
(a) v × w = −w × v
Anticommutative Law
(b) u × (v + w) = u × v + u × w

Distributive Law

(c) (u + v) × w = u × w + v × w

Distributive Law

(d) ( kv) × w = v × ( kw) = k(v × w)

Associative Law

(e) v × 0 = 0 = 0 × v
(f) v × v = 0

(g) v × w = 0 if and only if v ∥ w

and leave the rest to the reader as exercises.

v × w = (v2 w3 − v3 w2 , v3 w1 − v1 w3 , v1 w2 − v2 w1 )

Note that this says that v × w and w × v have the same magnitude but opposite direction (see Figure 1.4.6).

w× v
Figure 1.4.6

(g) If either v or w is 0 then v × w = 0 by part (e), and either v = 0 = 0w or w = 0 = 0v, so v
and w are scalar multiples, i.e. they are parallel.
If both v and w are nonzero, and θ is the angle between them, then by formula (1.11),
v × w = 0 if and only if k v k k w k sin θ = 0, which is true if and only if sin θ = 0 (since k v k > 0
and k w k > 0). So since 0◦ ≤ θ ≤ 180◦ , then sin θ = 0 if and only if θ = 0◦ or 180◦ . But the
angle between v and w is 0◦ or 180◦ if and only if v ∥ w.

Recall from geometry that a parallelepiped is a 3-dimensional solid with 6 faces, all of
which are parallelograms.6

some vectors v1 , v2 , v3 in R3 , where 0 ≤ k 1 , k 2 , k 3 ≤ 1.

Example 1.12. Volume of a parallelepiped: Let the vectors u, v, w in R3 represent adjacent
sides of a parallelepiped P , with u, v, w forming a right-handed system, as in Figure 1.4.7.
Show that the volume of P is the scalar triple product u · (v × w).
Solution: Recall that the volume vol(P ) of a par- v × w
allelepiped P is the area A of the base parallelogram times the height h. By Theorem 1.13(b),
the area A of the base parallelogram is k v × w k.
And we can see that since v × w is perpendicular
to the base parallelogram determined by v and
w, then the height h is k u k cos θ , where θ is the
angle between u and v × w. By Theorem 1.6 we
know that
u · (v × w)
. Hence,
kuk kv × wk
vol(P ) = A h

= kv × wk

Figure 1.4.7

Parallelepiped P

In Example 1.12 the height h of the parallelepiped is k u k cos θ , and not −k u k cos θ , because the vector u is on the same side of the base parallelogram’s plane as the vector v × w
(so that cos θ > 0). Since the volume is the same no matter which base and height we use,
then repeating the same steps using the base determined by u and v (since w is on the same
side of that base’s plane as u × v), the volume is w · (u × v). Repeating this with the base
determined by w and u, we have the following result:
For any vectors u, v, w in R3 ,
u · (v × w) = w · (u × v) = v · (w × u)

(1.12)

(Note that the equalities hold trivially if any of the vectors are 0.)
Since v × w = −w × v for any vectors v, w in R3 , then picking the wrong order for the three
adjacent sides in the scalar triple product in formula (1.12) will give you the negative of the
volume of the parallelepiped. So taking the absolute value of the scalar triple product for
any order of the three adjacent sides will always give the volume:
Theorem 1.15. If vectors u, v, w in R3 represent any three adjacent sides of a parallelepiped, then the volume of the parallelepiped is | u · (v × w) |.
Another type of triple product is the vector triple product u × (v × w). The proof of the
following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader:

26

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

Theorem 1.16. For any vectors u, v, w in R3 ,
u × (v × w) = (u · w)v − (u · v)w

(1.13)

An examination of the formula in Theorem 1.16 gives some idea of the geometry of the
vector triple product. By the right side of formula (1.13), we see that u × (v × w) is a scalar
combination of v and w, and hence lies in the plane containing v and w (i.e. u × (v × w), v
and w are coplanar). This makes sense since, by Theorem 1.11, u × (v × w) is perpendicular
to both u and v × w. In particular, being perpendicular to v × w means that u × (v × w) lies
in the plane containing v and w, since that plane is itself perpendicular to v × w. But then
how is u × (v × w) also perpendicular to u, which could be any vector? The following example
may help to see how this works.
Example 1.13. Find u × (v × w) for u = (1, 2, 4), v = (2, 2, 0), w = (1, 3, 0).
Solution: Since u · v = 6 and u · w = 7, then

u × (v × w) = (u · w)v − (u · v)w

= 7 (2, 2, 0) − 6 (1, 3, 0) = (14, 14, 0) − (6, 18, 0)
= (8, −4, 0)

Note that v and w lie in the x y-plane, and that u × (v × w) also lies in that plane. Also,
u × (v × w) is perpendicular to both u and v × w = (0, 0, 4) (see Figure 1.4.8).

For vectors v = v1 i + v2 j + v3 k and w = w1 i + w2 j + w3 k in component form, the cross product
is written as: v × w = (v2 w3 − v3 w2 )i + (v3 w1 − v1 w3 )j + (v1 w2 − v2 w1 )k. It is often easier to use the
component form for the cross product, because it can be represented as a determinant. We
will not go too deeply into the theory of determinants7 ; we will just cover what is essential
for our purposes.

We defined the determinant as a scalar, derived from algebraic operations on scalar entries in a matrix. However, if we put three vectors in the first row of a 3 × 3 matrix, then
the definition still makes sense, since we would be performing scalar multiplication on those
three vectors (they would be multiplied by the 2×2 scalar determinants as before). This gives
us a determinant that is now a vector, and lets us write the cross product of v = v1 i + v2 j + v3 k

The scalar triple product can also be written as a determinant. In fact, by Example 1.12,
the following theorem provides an alternate definition of the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix
as the volume of a parallelepiped whose adjacent sides are the rows of the matrix and form
a right-handed system (a left-handed system would give the negative volume).

1.5 Lines and Planes
Now that we know how to perform some operations on vectors, we can start to deal with some
familiar geometric objects, like lines and planes, in the language of vectors. The reason
for doing this is simple: using vectors makes it easier to study objects in 3-dimensional
Euclidean space. We will first consider lines.

Line through a point, parallel to a vector
Let P = ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) be a point in R3 , let v = (a, b, c) be a nonzero vector, and let L be the line
through P which is parallel to v (see Figure 1.5.1).

Let r = ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) be the vector pointing from the origin to P . Since multiplying the vector
v by a scalar t lengthens or shrinks v while preserving its direction if t > 0, and reversing
its direction if t < 0, then we see from Figure 1.5.1 that every point on the line L can be
obtained by adding the vector tv to the vector r for some scalar t. That is, as t varies over all
real numbers, the vector r + tv will point to every point on L. We can summarize the vector
representation of L as follows:
For a point P = ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) and nonzero vector v in R3 , the line L through P parallel to v
is given by
r + tv, for − ∞ < t < ∞
(1.16)
where r = ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) is the vector pointing to P .
Note that we used the correspondence between a vector and its terminal point. Since
v = (a, b, c), then the terminal point of the vector r + tv is ( x0 + at, y0 + bt, z0 + ct). We then get
the parametric representation of L with the parameter t:
For a point P = ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) and nonzero vector v = (a, b, c) in R3 , the line L through P
parallel to v consists of all points ( x, y, z) given by

x = x0 + at,

y = y0 + bt,

z = z0 + ct, for − ∞ < t < ∞

Note that in both representations we get the point P on L by letting t = 0.

(1.17)

32

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

In formula (1.17), if a 6= 0, then we can solve for the parameter t: t = ( x − x0 )/a. We can also
solve for t in terms of y and in terms of z if neither b nor c, respectively, is zero: t = ( y − y0 )/ b
and t = ( z − z0 )/ c. These three values all equal the same value t, so we can write the following
system of equalities, called the symmetric representation of L:
For a point P = ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) and vector v = (a, b, c) in R3 with a, b and c all nonzero, the line
L through P parallel to v consists of all points ( x, y, z) given by the equations

x − x0 y − y0 z − z0
=
=
a
b
c

(1.18)

What if, say, a = 0 in the above scenario? We can not divide by
zero, but we do know that x = x0 + at, and so x = x0 + 0 t = x0 . Then the
symmetric representation of L would be:

x = x0 ,

y − y0 z − z0
=
b
c

z
L
y
0

(1.19)

x = x0

Note that this says that the line L lies in the plane x = x0 , which is
x
parallel to the yz-plane (see Figure 1.5.2). Similar equations can be
Figure 1.5.2
derived for the cases when b = 0 or c = 0.
You may have noticed that the vector representation of L in formula (1.16) is more compact
than the parametric and symmetric formulas. That is an advantage of using vector notation.
Technically, though, the vector representation gives us the vectors whose terminal points
make up the line L, not just L itself. So you have to remember to identify the vectors r + tv
with their terminal points. On the other hand, the parametric representation always gives
just the points on L and nothing else.
Example 1.19. Write the line L through the point P = (2, 3, 5) and parallel to the vector
v = (4, −1, 6), in the following forms: (a) vector, (b) parametric, (c) symmetric. Lastly: (d) find
two points on L distinct from P .
Solution: (a) Let r = (2, 3, 5). Then by formula (1.16), L is given by:
r + tv = (2, 3, 5) + t(4, −1, 6), for − ∞ < t < ∞
(b) L consists of the points ( x, y, z) such that

x = 2 + 4 t,

y = 3 − t,

z = 5 + 6 t, for − ∞ < t < ∞

(c) L consists of the points ( x, y, z) such that

(d) Letting t = 1 and t = 2 in part(b) yields the points (6, 2, 11) and (10, 1, 17) on L.

Line through two points
Let P1 = ( x1 , y1 , z1 ) and P2 = ( x2 , y2 , z2 ) be distinct points
in R3 , and let L be the line through P1 and P2 . Let r1 =
( x1 , y1 , z1 ) and r2 = ( x2 , y2 , z2 ) be the vectors pointing to P1
and P2 , respectively. Then as we can see from Figure
1.5.3, r2 − r1 is the vector from P1 to P2 . So if we multiply
the vector r2 − r1 by a scalar t and add it to the vector
r1 , we will get the entire line L as t varies over all real
numbers. The following is a summary of the vector, parametric, and symmetric forms for the line L:

Example 1.20. Write the line L through the points P1 = (−3, 1, −4) and P2 = (4, 4, −6) in
parametric form.
Solution: By formula (1.21), L consists of the points ( x, y, z) such that

x = −3 + 7 t,

y = 1 + 3 t,

z = −4 − 2 t, for − ∞ < t < ∞

Distance between a point and a line
Let L be a line in R3 in vector form as r + tv (for −∞ < t < ∞),
and let P be a point not on L. The distance d from P to L is the
length of the line segment from P to L which is perpendicular to L
(see Figure 1.5.4). Pick a point Q on L, and let w be the vector from
Q to P . If θ is the angle between w and v, then d = k w k sin θ . So
since k v × w k = k v k k w k sin θ and v 6= 0, then:

It is clear that two lines L 1 and L 2 , represented in vector form as r1 + sv1 and r2 + tv2 ,
respectively, are parallel (denoted as L 1 ∥ L 2 ) if v1 and v2 are parallel. Also, L 1 and L 2 are
perpendicular (denoted as L 1 ⊥ L 2 ) if v1 and v2 are perpendicular.

z
In 2-dimensional space, two lines are either identical, parallel, or they

intersect. In 3-dimensional space, there is an additional possibility: two
lines can be skew, that is, they do not intersect but they are not parallel.

However, even though they are not parallel, skew lines are on parallel

planes (see Figure 1.5.5).
x
3
To determine whether two lines in R intersect, it is often easier to use
Figure 1.5.5
the parametric representation of the lines. In this case, you should use different parameter variables (usually s and t) for the lines, since the values of the parameters
may not be the same at the point of intersection. Setting the two ( x, y, z) triples equal will
result in a system of 3 equations in 2 unknowns ( s and t).

Example 1.22. Find the point of intersection (if any) of the following lines:

x+1 y−2 z−1

and

x+3 =

Solution: First we write the lines in parametric form, with parameters s and t:

x = −1 + 3 s,

y = 2 + 2 s,

z = 1−s

and

x = −3 + t,

y = 8 − 3 t,

z = −3 + 2 t

The lines intersect when (−1 + 3 s, 2 + 2 s, 1 − s) = (−3 + t, 8 − 3 t, −3 + 2 t) for some s, t:
−1 + 3 s = −3 + t : ⇒ t = 2 + 3 s

2 + 2 s = 8 − 3 t : ⇒ 2 + 2 s = 8 − 3(2 + 3 s) = 2 − 9 s ⇒ 2 s = −9 s ⇒ s = 0 ⇒ t = 2 + 3(0) = 2

1 − s = −3 + 2 t : 1 − 0 = −3 + 2(2) ⇒ 1 = 1 X (Note that we had to check this.)

Letting s = 0 in the equations for the first line, or letting t = 2 in the equations for the second
line, gives the point of intersection (−1, 2, 1).

1.5 Lines and Planes

35

We will now consider planes in 3-dimensional Euclidean space.

Plane through a point, perpendicular to a vector
Let P be a plane in R3 , and suppose it contains a point P0 = ( x0 , y0 , z0 ). Let n = (a, b, c) be
a nonzero vector which is perpendicular to the plane P . Such a vector is called a normal
vector (or just a normal) to the plane. Now let ( x, y, z) be any point in the plane P . Then
the vector r = ( x − x0 , y − y0 , z − z0 ) lies in the plane P (see Figure 1.5.6). So if r 6= 0, then r ⊥ n
and hence n · r = 0. And if r = 0 then we still have n · r = 0.

Conversely, if ( x, y, z) is any point in R3 such that r = ( x − x0 , y − y0 , z − z0 ) 6= 0 and n · r = 0,
then r ⊥ n and so ( x, y, z) lies in P . This proves the following theorem:
Theorem 1.18. Let P be a plane in R3 , let ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) be a point in P , and let n = (a, b, c) be a
nonzero vector which is perpendicular to P . Then P consists of the points ( x, y, z) satisfying
the vector equation:
n· r = 0
(1.24)
where r = ( x − x0 , y − y0 , z − z0 ), or equivalently:

a( x − x0 ) + b( y − y0 ) + c( z − z0 ) = 0

(1.25)

The above equation is called the point-normal form of the plane P .
Example 1.23. Find the equation of the plane P containing the point (−3, 1, 3) and perpendicular to the vector n = (2, 4, 8).
Solution: By formula (1.25), the plane P consists of all points ( x, y, z) such that:
2( x + 3) + 4( y − 1) + 8( z − 3) = 0
If we multiply out the terms in formula (1.25) and combine the constant terms, we get an
equation of the plane in normal form:

ax + b y + cz + d = 0
For example, the normal form of the plane in Example 1.23 is 2 x + 4 y + 8 z − 22 = 0.

(1.26)

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

Plane containing three noncollinear points
In 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional space, two points determine a line. Two points do
not determine a plane in R3 . In fact, three collinear points (i.e. all on the same line) do not
determine a plane; an infinite number of planes would contain the line on which those three
points lie. However, three noncollinear points do determine a plane. For if Q , R and S are
−−→
−−→
noncollinear points in R3 , then QR and QS are nonzero vectors which are not parallel (by
−−→ −−→

So QR and QS (and hence Q , R and S ) lie in the plane through the point Q with normal

Example 1.24. Find the equation of the plane P containing the points (2, 1, 3), (1, −1, 2) and
(3, 2, 1).
−−→
Solution: Let Q = (2, 1, 3), R = (1, −1, 2) and S = (3, 2, 1). Then for the vectors QR = (−1, −2, −1)
−−→
and QS = (1, 1, −2), the plane P has a normal vector
−−→ −−→
n = QR × QS = (−1, −2, −1) × (1, 1, −2) = (5, −3, 1)

So using formula (1.25) with the point Q (we could also use R or S ), the plane P consists of
all points ( x, y, z) such that:
5( x − 2) − 3( y − 1) + ( z − 3) = 0
or in normal form,
5 x − 3 y + z − 10 = 0
We mentioned earlier that skew lines in R3 lie on separate, parallel planes. So two skew
lines do not determine a plane. But two (nonidentical) lines which either intersect or are
parallel do determine a plane. In both cases, to find the equation of the plane that contains
those two lines, simply pick from the two lines a total of three noncollinear points (i.e. one
point from one line and two points from the other), then use the technique above, as in
Example 1.24, to write the equation. We will leave examples of this as exercises for the
reader.

Distance between a point and a plane
The distance between a point in R3 and a plane is the length of the line segment from
that point to the plane which is perpendicular to the plane. The following theorem gives a
formula for that distance.
Theorem 1.19. Let Q = ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) be a point in R3 , and let P be a plane with normal form
ax + b y + cz + d = 0 that does not contain Q . Then the distance D from Q to P is:

D=

| ax0 + b y0 + cz0 + d |
p
a2 + b 2 + c 2

(1.27)

Proof: Let R = ( x, y, z) be any point in the plane P (so that ax + b y + cz + d = 0) and let
−−→
r = RQ = ( x0 − x, y0 − y, z0 − z). Then r 6= 0 since Q does not lie in P . From the normal form
equation for P , we know that n = (a, b, c) is a normal vector for P . Now, any plane divides
R3 into two disjoint parts. Assume that n points toward the side of P where the point Q
is located. Place n so that its initial point is at R , and let θ be the angle between r and
n. Then 0◦ < θ < 90◦ , so cos θ > 0. Thus, the distance D is cos θ k r k = | cos θ | k r k (see Figure
1.5.8).

If n points away from the side of P where the point Q is located, then 90◦ < θ < 180◦ and
so cos θ < 0. The distance D is then | cos θ | k r k, and thus repeating the same argument as
above still gives the same result.

Figure 1.5.9). Suppose that two planes P1 and P2 with normal vectors
n1 and n2 , respectively, intersect in a line L. Since n1 × n2 ⊥ n1 , then
n1 × n2 is parallel to the plane P1 . Likewise, n1 × n2 ⊥ n2 means that
Figure 1.5.9
n1 × n2 is also parallel to P2 . Thus, n1 × n2 is parallel to the intersection
of P1 and P2 , i.e. n1 × n2 is parallel to L. Thus, we can write L in the following vector form:

L : r + t(n1 × n2 ) , for − ∞ < t < ∞

(1.28)

where r is any vector pointing to a point belonging to both planes. To find a point in both
planes, find a common solution ( x, y, z) to the two normal form equations of the planes. This
can often be made easier by setting one of the coordinate variables to zero, which leaves you
to solve two equations in just two unknowns.
Example 1.26. Find the line of intersection L of the planes 5 x − 3 y + z − 10 = 0 and 2 x + 4 y −
z + 3 = 0.

Solution: The plane 5 x − 3 y + z − 10 = 0 has normal vector n1 = (5, −3, 1) and the plane 2 x +
4 y − z + 3 = 0 has normal vector n2 = (2, 4, −1). Since n1 and n2 are not scalar multiples, then
the two planes are not parallel and hence will intersect. A point ( x, y, z) on both planes will
satisfy the following system of two equations in three unknowns:
5 x − 3 y + z − 10 = 0

2x + 4 y − z + 3 = 0
Set x = 0 (why is that a good choice?). Then the above equations are reduced to:
−3 y + z − 10 = 0

4y − z + 3 = 0

The second equation gives z = 4 y + 3, substituting that into the first equation gives y = 7.
Then z = 31, and so the point (0, 7, 31) is on L. Since n1 × n2 = (−1, 7, 26), then L is given by:
r + t(n1 × n2 ) = (0, 7, 31) + t(−1, 7, 26), for − ∞ < t < ∞
or in parametric form:

x = − t,

y = 7 + 7 t,

z = 31 + 26 t, for − ∞ < t < ∞

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

1.6 Surfaces
In the previous section we discussed planes in Euclidean space. A plane is an example of
a surface, which we will define informally8 as the solution set of the equation F ( x, y, z) = 0
in R3 , for some real-valued function F . For example, a plane given by ax + b y + cz + d = 0
is the solution set of F ( x, y, z) = 0 for the function F ( x, y, z) = ax + b y + cz + d . Surfaces are
2-dimensional. The plane is the simplest surface, since it is “flat”. In this section we will
look at some surfaces that are more complex, the most important of which are the sphere
and the cylinder.
Definition 1.9. A sphere S is the set of all points ( x, y, z) in R3 which are a fixed distance r
(called the radius) from a fixed point P0 = ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) (called the center of the sphere):

S = { ( x, y, z) : ( x − x0 )2 + ( y − y0 )2 + ( z − z0 )2 = r 2 }

(1.29)

Using vector notation, this can be written in the equivalent form:

S = { x : k x − x0 k = r }

(1.30)

where x = ( x, y, z) and x0 = ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) are vectors.
Figure 1.6.1 illustrates the vectorial approach to spheres.

Spheres in R3

Note in Figure 1.6.1(a) that the intersection of the sphere with the x y-plane is a circle
of radius r (i.e. a great circle, given by x2 + y2 = r 2 as a subset of R2 ). Similarly for the
intersections with the xz-plane and the yz-plane. In general, a plane intersects a sphere
either at a single point or in a circle.
8 See O’N EILL for a deeper and more rigorous discussion of surfaces.

Example 1.27. Find the intersection of the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 169 with the plane z = 12.
z

Solution:
p The sphere is centered at the origin and has radius
13 = 169, so it does intersect the plane z = 12. Putting
z = 12 into the equation of the sphere gives

z = 12
y

x2 + y2 + 122 = 169

x2 + y2 = 169 − 144 = 25 = 52

which is a circle of radius 5 centered at (0, 0, 12), parallel to
the x y-plane (see Figure 1.6.2).

x
Figure 1.6.2

If the equation in formula (1.29) is multiplied out, we get an equation of the form:

x2 + y2 + z2 + ax + b y + cz + d = 0

(1.31)

for some constants a, b, c and d . Conversely, an equation of this form may describe a sphere,
which can be determined by completing the square for the x, y and z variables.
Example 1.28. Is 2 x2 + 2 y2 + 2 z2 − 8 x + 4 y − 16 z + 10 = 0 the equation of a sphere?

Solution: Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives

x 2 + y2 + z 2 − 4 x + 2 y − 8 z + 5 = 0

( x2 − 4 x + 4) + ( y2 + 2 y + 1) + ( z2 − 8 z + 16) + 5 − 4 − 1 − 16 = 0
( x − 2)2 + ( y + 1)2 + ( z − 4)2 = 16

which is a sphere of radius 4 centered at (2, −1, 4).
Example 1.29. Find the points(s) of intersection (if any) of the sphere from Example 1.28
and the line x = 3 + t, y = 1 + 2 t, z = 3 − t.

Solution: Put the equations of the line into the equation of the sphere, which was ( x − 2)2 +
( y + 1)2 + ( z − 4)2 = 16, and solve for t:
(3 + t − 2)2 + (1 + 2 t + 1)2 + (3 − t − 4)2 = 16
( t + 1)2 + (2 t + 2)2 + (− t − 1)2 = 16
6 t2 + 12 t − 10 = 0

The quadratic formula gives the solutions t = −1 ± p . Putting those two values into the

equations of the line gives the following two points of intersection:

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

If two spheres intersect, they do so either at a single point or in a circle.
Example 1.30. Find the intersection (if any) of the spheres x2 + y2 + z2 = 25 and x2 + y2 + ( z −
2)2 = 16.
Solution: For any point ( x, y, z) on both spheres, we see that

x2 + y2 + z2 = 25

x2 + y2 + ( z − 2)2 = 16

16 − ( z − 2)2 = 25 − z2

⇒

x2 + y2 = 25 − z2 , and

⇒

x2 + y2 = 16 − ( z − 2)2 , so

⇒

4z − 4 = 9

⇒

⇒

z = 13/4

x + y = 25 − (13/4)2 = 231/16

The cylinders that we will consider are right circular cylinders. These are cylinders obtained by moving a line L along a circle C in R3 in a way so that L is always perpendicular
to the plane containing C . We will only consider the cases where the plane containing C is
parallel to one of the three coordinate planes (see Figure 1.6.3).

Cylinders in R3

For example, the equation of a cylinder whose base circle C lies in the x y-plane and is
centered at (a, b, 0) and has radius r is
( x − a)2 + ( y − b)2 = r 2 ,

(1.32)

where the value of the z coordinate is unrestricted. Similar equations can be written when
the base circle lies in one of the other coordinate planes. A plane intersects a right circular
cylinder in a circle, ellipse, or one or two lines, depending on whether that plane is parallel,
oblique9 , or perpendicular, respectively, to the plane containing C . The intersection of a
surface with a plane is called the trace of the surface.
9 i.e. at an angle strictly between 0◦ and 90◦ .

1.6 Surfaces

43

The equations of spheres and cylinders are examples of second-degree equations in R3 , i.e.
equations of the form

Ax2 + B y2 + Cz2 + Dx y + Exz + F yz + Gx + H y + I z + J = 0

(1.33)

for some constants A , B, . . . , J . If the above equation is not that of a sphere, cylinder, plane,
line or point, then the resulting surface is called a quadric surface.
One type of quadric surface is the ellipsoid, given
by an equation of the form:

x 2 y2 z 2

a2 b 2 c 2

In the case where a = b = c, this is just a sphere.
In general, an ellipsoid is egg-shaped (think of an
ellipse rotated around its major axis). Its traces in
the coordinate planes are ellipses.

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

For the hyperboloid of one sheet, the trace in any plane parallel to the x y-plane is an
ellipse. The traces in the planes parallel to the xz- or yz-planes are hyperbolas (see Figure
1.6.5), except for the special cases x = ±a and y = ± b; in those planes the traces are pairs of
intersecting lines (see Exercise 8).
For the hyperboloid of two sheets, the trace in any plane parallel to the x y- or xz-plane is
a hyperbola (see Figure 1.6.6). There is no trace in the yz-plane. In any plane parallel to the
yz-plane for which | x | > | a |, the trace is an ellipse.
z

The elliptic paraboloid is another type of quadric surface,
whose equation has the form:

x 2 y2 z
+
=
a2 b 2 c

(1.37)

The traces in planes parallel to the x y-plane are ellipses, though
in the x y-plane itself the trace is a single point. The traces in
planes parallel to the xz- or yz-planes are parabolas. Figure
y
1.6.7 shows the case where c > 0. When c < 0 the surface is

The hyperbolic paraboloid can be tricky to draw; using graphing software on a computer
can make it easier. For example, Figure 1.6.8 was created using the free Gnuplot package
(see Appendix C). It shows the graph of the hyperbolic paraboloid z = y2 − x2 , which is the
special case where a = b = 1 and c = −1 in equation (1.38). The mesh lines on the surface are
the traces in planes parallel to the coordinate planes. So we see that the traces in planes
parallel to the xz-plane are parabolas pointing upward, while the traces in planes parallel
to the yz-plane are parabolas pointing downward. Also, notice that the traces in planes
parallel to the x y-plane are hyperbolas, though in the x y-plane itself the trace is a pair of
intersecting lines through the origin. This is true in general when c < 0 in equation (1.38).
When c > 0, the surface would be similar to that in Figure 1.6.8, only rotated 90◦ around
the z-axis and the nature of the traces in planes parallel to the xz- or yz-planes would be
reversed.
The last type of quadric surface that we will consider is the
elliptic cone, which has an equation of the form:

x 2 y2 z 2
+
−
=0
a2 b 2 c 2

z

(1.39)

y
The traces in planes parallel to the x y-plane are ellipses, ex0
cept in the x y-plane itself where the trace is a single point.
The traces in planes parallel to the xz- or yz-planes are hyperbolas, except in the xz- and yz-planes themselves where the
traces are pairs of intersecting lines.
x
Notice that every point on the elliptic cone is on a line which
lies entirely on the surface; in Figure 1.6.9 these lines all go
Figure 1.6.9 Elliptic cone
through the origin. This makes the elliptic cone an example of
a ruled surface. The cylinder is also a ruled surface.
What may not be as obvious is that both the hyperboloid of one sheet and the hyperbolic
paraboloid are ruled surfaces. In fact, on both surfaces there are two lines through each
point on the surface (see Exercises 11-12). Such surfaces are called doubly ruled surfaces,
and the pairs of lines are called a regulus.
It is clear that for each of the six types of quadric surfaces that we discussed, the surface
can be translated away from the origin (e.g. by replacing x2 by ( x − x0 )2 in its equation). It can
be proved11 that every quadric surface can be translated and/or rotated so that its equation
matches one of the six types that we described. For example, z = 2 x y is a case of equation
(1.33) with “mixed” variables, e.g. with D 6= 0 so that we get an x y term. This equation does
◦
not match any of the types we considered. However, by rotating the
p x- and y′ -axes
pby 45 in

the x y-plane by means of the coordinate transformation x = ( x − y )/ 2, y = ( x + y )/ 2, z = z′ ,
then z = 2 x y becomes the hyperbolic paraboloid z′ = ( x′ )2 − ( y′ )2 in the ( x′ , y′ , z′ ) coordinate
system. That is, z = 2 x y is a hyperbolic paraboloid as in equation (1.38), but rotated 45◦ in
the x y-plane.

1.7 Curvilinear Coordinates
z
(x, y, z)
The Cartesian coordinates of a point ( x, y, z) are determined by
following straight paths starting from the origin: first along the
z
x-axis, then parallel to the y-axis, then parallel to the z-axis, as
y
in Figure 1.7.1. In curvilinear coordinate systems, these paths can

x
be curved. The two types of curvilinear coordinates which we will
consider are cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Instead of refy
x
erencing a point in terms of sides of a rectangular parallelepiped,
Figure 1.7.1
as with Cartesian coordinates, we will think of the point as lying on a cylinder or sphere. Cylindrical coordinates are often used when there is symmetry
around the z-axis; spherical coordinates are useful when there is symmetry about the origin.
Let P = ( x, y, z) be a point in Cartesian coordinates in R3 , and let P0 = ( x, y, 0) be the
projection of P upon the x y-plane. Treating ( x, y) as a point in R2 , let ( r, θ ) be its polar
coordinates (see Figure 1.7.2). Let ρ be the length of the line segment from the origin to P ,
and let φ be the angle between that line segment and the positive z-axis (see Figure 1.7.3).
φ is called the zenith angle. Then the cylindrical coordinates ( r, θ , z) and the spherical
coordinates (ρ , θ , φ) of P ( x, y, z) are defined as follows:13

Both θ and φ are measured in radians. Note that r ≥ 0, 0 ≤ θ < 2π, ρ ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ φ ≤ π.
Also, θ is undefined when ( x, y) = (0, 0), and φ is undefined when ( x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0).
13 This “standard” definition of spherical coordinates used by mathematicians results in a left-handed system.
For this reason, physicists usually switch the definitions of θ and φ to make (ρ , θ , φ) a right-handed system.

For spherical coordinates (ρ , θ , φ), and constants ρ 0 , θ0 and φ0 , we see from Figure 1.7.5
that the surface ρ = ρ 0 is a sphere of radius ρ 0 centered at the origin, the surface θ = θ0 is a
half-plane emanating from the z-axis, and the surface φ = φ0 is a circular cone whose vertex
is at the origin.

Sometimes the equation of a surface in Cartesian coordinates can be transformed into a
simpler equation in some other coordinate system, as in the following example.
Example 1.32. Write the equation of the cylinder x2 + y2 = 4 in cylindrical coordinates.
p
Solution: Since r = x2 + y2 , then the equation in cylindrical coordinates is r = 2.

Using spherical coordinates to write the equation of a sphere does not necessarily make
the equation simpler, if the sphere is not centered at the origin.
Example 1.33. Write the equation ( x − 2)2 + ( y − 1)2 + z2 = 9 in spherical coordinates.

Solution: Multiplying the equation out gives

x2 + y2 + z2 − 4 x − 2 y + 5 = 9 , so we get

ρ 2 − 4ρ sin φ cos θ − 2ρ sin φ sin θ − 4 = 0 , or
ρ 2 − 2 sin φ (2 cos θ − sin θ ) ρ − 4 = 0

after combining terms. Note that this actually makes it more difficult to figure out what the
surface is, as opposed to the Cartesian equation where you could immediately identify the
surface as a sphere of radius 3 centered at (2, 1, 0).
Example 1.34. Describe the surface given by θ = z in cylindrical coordinates.

Solution: This surface is called a helicoid. As the (vertical) z coordinate increases, so does
the angle θ , while the radius r is unrestricted. So this sweeps out a (ruled!) surface shaped
like a spiral staircase, where the spiral has an infinite radius. Figure 1.7.6 shows a section
of this surface restricted to 0 ≤ z ≤ 4π and 0 ≤ r ≤ 2.

1.8 Vector-Valued Functions
Now that we are familiar with vectors and their operations, we can begin discussing functions whose values are vectors.
Definition 1.10. A vector-valued function of a real variable is a rule that associates a
vector f( t) with a real number t, where t is in some subset D of R1 (called the domain of f).
We write f : D → R3 to denote that f is a mapping of D into R3 .
For example, f( t) = ti + t2 j + t3 k is a vector-valued function in R3 , defined for all real numbers t. We would write f : R → R3 . At t = 1 the value of the function is the vector i + j + k,
which in Cartesian coordinates has the terminal point (1, 1, 1).
A vector-valued function of a real variable can be written in component form as
f( t) = f 1 ( t)i + f 2 ( t)j + f 3 ( t)k
or in the form
f( t) = ( f 1 ( t), f 2 ( t), f 3 ( t))
for some real-valued functions f 1 ( t), f 2 ( t), f 3 ( t), called the component functions of f. The first
form is often used when emphasizing that f( t) is a vector, and the second form is useful
when considering just the terminal points of the vectors. By identifying vectors with their
terminal points, a curve in space can be written as a vector-valued function.
z
3

Example 1.35. Define f : R → R by f( t) = (cos t, sin t, t).
This is the equation of a helix (see Figure 1.8.1). As the value of
t increases, the terminal points of f( t) trace out a curve spiraling
upward. For each t, the x- and y-coordinates of f( t) are x = cos t
and y = sin t, so
x2 + y2 = cos2 t + sin2 t = 1.
Thus, the curve lies on the surface of the right circular cylinder
x2 + y2 = 1.

It may help to think of vector-valued functions of a real variable in R3 as a generalization
of the parametric functions in R2 which you learned about in single-variable calculus. Much
of the theory of real-valued functions of a single real variable can be applied to vector-valued
functions of a real variable. Since each of the three component functions are real-valued, it
will sometimes be the case that results from single-variable calculus can simply be applied
to each of the component functions to yield a similar result for the vector-valued function.
However, there are times when such generalizations do not hold (see Exercise 13). The
concept of a limit, though, can be extended naturally to vector-valued functions, as in the
following definition.

52

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

Definition 1.11. Let f( t) be a vector-valued function, let a be a real number and let c be a
vector. Then we say that the limit of f( t) as t approaches a equals c, written as lim f( t) = c,
t→ a

if lim k f( t) − c k = 0. If f( t) = ( f 1 ( t), f 2 ( t), f 3 ( t)), then

´
lim f( t) = lim f 1 ( t), lim f 2 ( t), lim f 3 ( t)

provided that all three limits on the right side exist.
The above definition shows that continuity and the derivative of vector-valued functions
can also be defined in terms of its component functions.
Definition 1.12. Let f( t) = ( f 1 ( t), f 2 ( t), f 3 ( t)) be a vector-valued function, and let a be a real
number in its domain. Then f( t) is continuous at a if lim f( t) = f(a). Equivalently, f( t) is
t→ a

continuous at a if and only if f 1 ( t), f 2 ( t), and f 3 ( t) are continuous at a.

(a), is the limit
The derivative of f( t) at a, denoted by f ′ (a) or
dt

f ′ (a) = lim

if that limit exists. Equivalently, f ′ (a) = ( f 1 ′ (a), f 2 ′ (a), f 3 ′ (a)), if the component derivatives
exist. We say that f( t) is differentiable at a if f ′ (a) exists.
Recall that the derivative of a real-valued function of a single variable is a real number,
representing the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at a point. Similarly,
the derivative of a vector-valued function is a tangent vector to the curve in space which
the function represents, and it lies on the tangent line to the curve (see Figure 1.8.2).

L to the curve at f(2π) = (1, 0, 2π) is L = f(2π) + s f ′ (2π) = (1, 0, 2π) + s(0, 1, 1), or in parametric
form: x = 1, y = s, z = 2π + s for −∞ < s < ∞.

A scalar function is a real-valued function. Note that if u( t) is a scalar function and
f( t) is a vector-valued function, then their product, defined by ( u f)( t) = u( t) f( t) for all t, is a
vector-valued function (since the product of a scalar with a vector is a vector).
The basic properties of derivatives of vector-valued functions are summarized in the following theorem.
Theorem 1.20. Let f( t) and g( t) be differentiable vector-valued functions, let u( t) be a
differentiable scalar function, let k be a scalar, and let c be a constant vector. Then

We know that k f( t) k is constant if and only if

If k f( t) k 6= 0, then k f( t) k is constant if and only if f( t) ⊥ f ′ ( t) for all t.
This means that if a curve lies completely on a sphere (or circle) centered at the origin, then
the tangent vector f ′ ( t) is always perpendicular to the position vector f( t).

We can use vector-valued functions to represent physical quantities, such as velocity, acceleration, force, momentum, etc. For example, let the real variable t represent time elapsed
from some initial time ( t = 0), and suppose that an object of constant mass m is subjected
to some force so that it moves in space, with its position ( x, y, z) at time t a function of
t. That is, x = x( t), y = y( t), z = z( t) for some real-valued functions x( t), y( t), z( t). Call
r( t) = ( x( t), y( t), z( t)) the position vector of the object. We can define various physical quantities associated with the object as follows:14
position: r( t) = ( x( t), y( t), z( t))

force: F( t) = ṗ( t) = p ′ ( t) =

dt

(Newton’s Second Law of Motion)

The magnitude k v( t) k of the velocity vector is called the speed of the object. Note that since
the mass m is a constant, the force equation becomes the familiar F( t) = ma( t).
Example 1.39. Let r( t) = (5 cos t, 3 sin t, 4 sin t) be the position vector of an object at time t ≥ 0.
Find its (a) velocity and (b) acceleration vectors.
Solution: (a) v( t) = ṙ( t) = (−5 sin t, 3 cos t, 4 cos t)

(b) a( t) = v̇( t) = (−5 cos t, −3 sin t, −4 sin t)
p
Note that k r( t) k = 25 cos2 t + 25 sin2 t = 5 for all t, so by Example 1.37 we know that r( t) ·
ṙ( t) = 0 for all t (which we can verify from part (a)). In fact, k v( t) k = 5 for all t also. And not
only does r( t) lie on the sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin, but perhaps not so obvious
is that it lies completely within a circle of radius 5 centered at the origin. Also, note that
a( t) = −r( t). It turns out (see Exercise 16) that whenever an object moves in a circle with
constant speed, the acceleration vector will point in the opposite direction of the position
vector (i.e. towards the center of the circle).
14 We will often use the older dot notation for derivatives when physics is involved.

56

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

Recall from Section 1.5 that if r1 , r2 are position vectors to distinct points then r1 + t(r2 − r1 )
represents a line through those two points as t varies over all real numbers. That vector
sum can be written as (1 − t)r1 + tr2 . So the function l( t) = (1 − t)r1 + tr2 is a line through
the terminal points of r1 and r2 , and when t is restricted to the interval [0, 1] it is the line
segment between the points, with l(0) = r1 and l(1) = r2 .
In general, a function of the form f( t) = (a 1 t + b 1 , a 2 t + b 2 , a 3 t + b 3 ) represents a line in R3 . A
function of the form f( t) = (a 1 t2 + b 1 t + c 1 , a 2 t2 + b 2 t + c 2 , a 3 t2 + b 3 t + c 3 ) represents a (possibly
degenerate) parabola in R3 .
Example 1.40. Bézier curves are used in Computer Aided Design (CAD) to approximate
the shape of a polygonal path in space (called the Bézier polygon or control polygon). For
instance, given three points (or position vectors) b0 , b1 , b2 in R3 , define
b10 ( t) = (1 − t)b0 + tb1

b11 ( t) = (1 − t)b1 + tb2

b20 ( t) = (1 − t)b10 ( t) + tb11 ( t)

= (1 − t)2 b0 + 2 t(1 − t)b1 + t2 b2

for all real t. For t in the interval [0, 1], we see that b10 ( t) is the line segment between b0 and
b1 , and b11 ( t) is the line segment between b1 and b2 . The function b20 ( t) is the Bézier curve
for the points b0 , b1 , b2 . Note from the last formula that the curve is a parabola that goes
through b0 (when t = 0) and b2 (when t = 1).
As an example, let b0 = (0, 0, 0), b1 = (1, 2, 3), and b2 = (4, 5, 2). Then the explicit formula for
the Bézier curve is b20 ( t) = (2 t + 2 t2 , 4 t + t2 , 6 t − 4 t2 ), as shown in Figure 1.8.4, where the line
segments are b10 ( t) and b11 ( t), and the curve is b20 ( t).

In general, the polygonal path determined by n ≥ 3 noncollinear points in R3 can be used
to define the Bézier curve recursively by a process called repeated linear interpolation. This
curve will be a vector-valued function whose components are polynomials of degree n − 1,
and its formula is given by de Casteljau’s algorithm.15 In the exercises, the reader will be
given the algorithm for the case of n = 4 points and asked to write the explicit formula for

1.9 Arc Length
Let r( t) = ( x( t), y( t), z( t)) be the position vector of an object moving in R3 . Since k v( t) k is the
speed of the object at time t, it seems natural to define the distance s traveled by the object
from time t = a to t = b as the definite integral

s=

Zb
a

k v( t) k dt =

Zb q
a

x ′ ( t)2 + y ′ ( t)2 + z ′ ( t)2 dt ,

(1.40)

which is analogous to the case from single-variable calculus for parametric functions in R2 .
This is indeed how we will define the distance traveled and, in general, the arc length of a
curve in R3 .
Definition 1.13. Let f( t) = ( x( t), y( t), z( t)) be a curve in R3 whose domain includes the interval [a, b]. Suppose that in the interval (a, b) the first derivative of each component function
x( t), y( t) and z( t) exists and is continuous, and that no section of the curve is repeated. Then
the arc length L of the curve from t = a to t = b is

L=

Zb
a

′

k f ( t) k dt =

Zb q
a

x ′ ( t)2 + y ′ ( t)2 + z ′ ( t)2 dt

(1.41)

A real-valued function whose first derivative is continuous is called continuously differentiable (or a C 1 function), and a function whose derivatives of all orders are continuous
is called smooth (or a C ∞ function). All the functions we will consider will be smooth. A
smooth curve f( t) is one whose derivative f ′ ( t) is never the zero vector and whose component
functions are all smooth.
Note that we did not prove that the formula in the above definition actually gives the
length of a section of a curve. A rigorous proof requires dealing with some subtleties, normally glossed over in calculus texts, which are beyond the scope of this book.16
Example 1.41. Find the length L of the helix f( t) = (cos t, sin t, t) from t = 0 to t = 2π.
Solution: By formula (1.41), we have

Similar to the case in R2 , if there are values of t in the interval [a, b] where the derivative
of a component function is not continuous then it is often possible to partition [a, b] into
subintervals where all the component functions are continuously differentiable (except at
the endpoints, which can be ignored). The sum of the arc lengths over the subintervals will
be the arc length over [a, b].
16 In particular, Duhamel’s principle is needed. See the proof in T AYLOR and M ANN, § 14.2 and § 18.2.

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

Notice that the curve traced out by the function f( t) = (cos t, sin t, t) from Example 1.41 is
also traced out by the function g( t) = (cos 2 t, sin 2 t, 2 t). For example, over the interval [0, π],
g( t) traces out the same section of the curve as f( t) does over the interval [0, 2π]. Intuitively,
this says that g( t) traces the curve twice as fast as f( t). This makes sense since, viewing the
functions as position
p vectors and their
p derivatives as velocity vectors, the speeds of f( t) and
g( t) are k f ′ ( t) k = 2 and k g ′ ( t) k = 2 2, respectively. We say that g( t) and f( t) are different
parametrizations of the same curve.
Definition 1.14. Let C be a smooth curve in R3 represented by a function f( t) defined on an
interval [a, b], and let α : [ c, d ] → [a, b] be a smooth one-to-one mapping of an interval [ c, d ]
onto [a, b]. Then the function g : [ c, d ] → R3 defined by g( s) = f(α( s)) is a parametrization of
C with parameter s. If α is strictly increasing on [ c, d ] then we say that g( s) is equivalent
to f( t).

g( s) = f(α( s)) = f( t)
Note that the differentiability of g( s) follows from a version of the Chain Rule for vectorvalued functions (the proof is left as an exercise):
Theorem 1.21. Chain Rule: If f( t) is a differentiable vector-valued function of t, and t =
α( s) is a differentiable scalar function of s, then f( s) = f(α( s)) is a differentiable vector-valued
function of s, and
d f d f dt
=
(1.42)
ds dt ds
for any s where the composite function f(α( s)) is defined.

Example 1.42. The following are all equivalent parametrizations of the same curve:
f( t) = (cos t, sin t, t) for t in [0, 2π]

g( s) = (cos 2 s, sin 2 s, 2 s) for s in [0, π]

h( s) = (cos 2π s, sin 2π s, 2π s) for s in [0, 1]
To see that g( s) is equivalent to f( t), define α : [0, π] → [0, 2π] by α( s) = 2 s. Then α is smooth,
one-to-one, maps [0, π] onto [0, 2π], and is strictly increasing (since α ′ ( s) = 2 > 0 for all s).
Likewise, defining α : [0, 1] → [0, 2π] by α( s) = 2π s shows that h( s) is equivalent to f( t).

1.9 Arc Length

61

A curve can have many parametrizations, with different speeds, so which one is the best
to use? In some situations the arc length parametrization can be useful. The idea behind
this is to replace the parameter t, for any given smooth parametrization f( t) defined on [a, b],
by the parameter s given by
Z
t

s = s( t) =

a

k f ′ ( u) k du.

(1.43)

In terms of motion along a curve, s is the distance traveled along the curve after time t
has elapsed. So the new parameter will be distance instead of time. There is a natural
correspondence between s and t: from a starting point on the curve, the distance traveled
along the curve (in one direction) is uniquely determined by the amount of time elapsed, and
vice versa.
Since s is the arc length of the curve over the interval [a, t] for each t in [a, b], then it is a
function of t. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, its derivative is
Z
d t ′
ds
′
=
s ( t) =
k f ( u) k du = k f ′ ( t) k for all t in [a, b].
dt dt a
Since f( t) is smooth, then k f ′ ( t) k > 0 for all t in [a, b]. Thus s ′ ( t) > 0 and hence s( t) is strictly
increasing on the interval [a, b]. Recall that this means that s is a one-to-one mapping of the
interval [a, b] onto the interval [ s(a), s( b)]. But we see that
Za
Zb
s( a) =
k f ′ ( u) k du = 0 and s( b) =
k f ′ ( u) k du = L = arc length from t = a to t = b
a

a

So the function s : [a, b] → [0, L] is a one-to-one, differentiable
mapping onto the interval [0, L]. From single-variable calculus,
we know that this means that there exists an inverse function
α : [0, L] → [a, b] that is differentiable and the inverse of s : [a, b] →
[0, L]. That is, for each t in [a, b] there is a unique s in [0, L] such
that s = s( t) and t = α( s). And we know that the derivative of α is
α ′ ( s) =

So define the arc length parametrization f : [0, L] → R3 by
f( s) = f(α( s)) for all s in [0, L].
Then f( s) is smooth, by the Chain Rule. In fact, f( s) has unit speed:
f ′ ( s) = f ′ (α( s)) α ′ ( s) by the Chain Rule, so
1
, so
= f ′ (α( s)) ′
k f (α( s)) k
k f ′ ( s) k = 1 for all s in [0, L].
So the arc length parametrization traverses the curve at a “normal” rate.

62

CHAPTER 1. VECTORS IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE

In practice, parametrizing a curve f( t) by arc length requires you to evaluate the integral
Rt
s = a k f ′ ( u) k du in some closed form (as a function of t) so that you could then solve for t in
terms of s. If that can be done, you would then substitute the expression for t in terms of s
(which we called α( s)) into the formula for f( t) to get f( s).
Example 1.43. Parametrize the helix f( t) = (cos t, sin t, t), for t in [0, 2π], by arc length.
Solution: By Example 1.41 and formula (1.43), we have

Arc length plays an important role when discussing curvature and moving frame fields,
in the field of mathematics known as differential geometry.17 The methods involve using
an arc length parametrization, which often leads to an integral that is either difficult or
impossible to evaluate in a simple closed form. The simple integral in Example 1.43 is
the exception, not the norm. In general, arc length parametrizations are more useful for
theoretical purposes than for practical computations.18 Curvature and moving frame fields
can be defined without using arc length, which makes their computation much easier, and
these definitions can be shown to be equivalent to those using arc length. We will leave this
to the exercises.
The arc length for curves given in other coordinate systems can also be calculated:
Theorem 1.22. Suppose that r = r ( t), θ = θ ( t) and z = z( t) are the cylindrical coordinates of
a curve f( t), for t in [a, b]. Then the arc length L of the curve over [a, b] is

L=

Zb p
a

r ′ ( t)2 + r ( t)2 θ ′ ( t)2 + z ′ ( t)2 dt

(1.44)

Proof: The Cartesian coordinates ( x( t), y( t), z( t)) of a point on the curve are given by

x( t) = r ( t) cos θ ( t),

y( t) = r ( t) sin θ ( t),

z ( t) = z ( t)

so differentiating the above expressions for x( t) and y( t) with respect to t gives

x ′ ( t) = r ′ ( t) cos θ ( t) − r ( t)θ ′ ( t) sin θ ( t),

y ′ ( t) = r ′ ( t) sin θ ( t) + r ( t)θ ′ ( t) cos θ ( t)

17 See O’N EILL for an introduction to elementary differential geometry.
18 For example, the usual parametrizations of Bézier curves, which we discussed in Section 1.8, are polynomial
functions in R3 . This makes their computation relatively simple, which, in CAD, is desirable. But their arc

length parametrizations are not only not polynomials, they are in fact usually impossible to calculate at all.

and so

2 Functions of Several Variables
2.1 Functions of Two or Three Variables
In Section 1.8 we discussed vector-valued functions of a single real variable. We will now
examine real-valued functions of a point (or vector) in R2 or R3 . For the most part these
functions will be defined on sets of points in R2 , but there will be times when we will use
points in R3 , and there will also be times when it will be convenient to think of the points as
vectors (or terminal points of vectors).
A real-valued function f defined on a subset D of R2 is a rule that assigns to each point
( x, y) in D a real number f ( x, y). The largest possible set D in R2 on which f is defined is
called the domain of f , and the range of f is the set of all real numbers f ( x, y) as ( x, y)
varies over the domain D . A similar definition holds for functions f ( x, y, z) defined on points
( x, y, z) in R3 .
Example 2.1. The domain of the function

f ( x, y) = x y
is all of R2 , and the range of f is all of R.
Example 2.2. The domain of the function

f ( x, y) =

1
x− y

is all of R2 except the points ( x, y) for which x = y. That is, the domain is the set D = {( x, y) :
x 6= y}. The range of f is all real numbers except 0.
Example 2.3. The domain of the function
q
f ( x, y) = 1 − x2 − y2

is the set D = {( x, y) : x2 + y2 ≤ 1}, since the quantity inside the square root is nonnegative if
and only if 1 − ( x2 + y2 ) ≥ 0. We see that D consists of all points on and inside the unit circle
in R2 (D is sometimes called the closed unit disk). The range of f is the interval [0, 1] in R.

65

66

CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES

Example 2.4. The domain of the function

f ( x, y, z) = e x+ y− z
is all of R3 , and the range of f is all positive real numbers.
A function f ( x, y) defined in R2 is often written as z = f ( x, y), as was mentioned in Section
1.1, so that the graph of f ( x, y) is the set {( x, y, z) : z = f ( x, y)} in R3 . So we see that this
graph is a surface in R3 , since it satisfies an equation of the form F ( x, y, z) = 0 (namely,
F ( x, y, z) = f ( x, y) − z). The traces of this surface in the planes z = c, where c varies over R,
are called the level curves of the function. Equivalently, the level curves are the solution
sets of the equations f ( x, y) = c, for c in R. Level curves are often projected onto the x y-plane
to give an idea of the various “elevation” levels of the surface (as is done in topography).
Example 2.5. The graph of the function
p
sin x2 + y2
f ( x, y) = p
x 2 + y2

is shown below. Note that the level curves (shown both on the surface and projected onto the
x y-plane) are groups of concentric circles.

You may be wondering what happens to the function in Example 2.5 at the point ( x, y) =
(0, 0), since both the numerator and denominator are 0 at that point. The function is not
defined at (0, 0), but the limit of the function exists (and equals 1) as ( x, y) approaches (0, 0).
We will now state explicitly what is meant by the limit of a function of two variables.

2.1 Functions of Two or Three Variables

67

Definition 2.1. Let (a, b) be a point in R2 , and let f ( x, y) be a real-valued function defined
on some set containing (a, b) (but not necessarily defined at (a, b) itself). Then we say that
the limit of f ( x, y) equals L as ( x, y) approaches (a, b), written as
lim

( x,y)→(a,b)

f ( x, y) = L ,

(2.1)

if given any ǫ > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that
| f ( x, y) − L | < ǫ whenever 0 <

q
( x − a)2 + ( y − b)2 < δ.

A similar definition can be made for functions of three variables. The idea behind the
above definition is that the values of f ( x, y) can get arbitrarily close to L (i.e. within ǫ of
L) if we pick ( x, y) sufficiently close to (a, b) (i.e. inside a circle centered at (a, b) with some
sufficiently small radius δ).
If you recall the “epsilon-delta” proofs of limits of real-valued functions of a single variable,
you may remember how awkward they can be, and how they can usually only be done easily
for simple functions. In general, the multivariable cases are at least equally awkward to go
through, so we will not bother with such proofs. Instead, we will simply state that when the
function f ( x, y) is given by a single formula and is defined at the point (a, b) (e.g. is not some
indeterminate form like 0/0) then you can just substitute ( x, y) = (a, b) into the formula for
f ( x, y) to find the limit.
Example 2.6.

is properly defined at the point (1, 2).

The major difference between limits in one variable and limits in two or more variables
has to do with how a point is approached. In the single-variable case, the statement “ x → a”
means that x gets closer to the value a from two possible directions along the real number
line (see Figure 2.1.2(a)). In two dimensions, however, ( x, y) can approach a point (a, b) along
an infinite number of paths (see Figure 2.1.2(b)).

does not exist

Note that we can not simply substitute ( x, y) = (0, 0) into the function, since doing so gives an
indeterminate form 0/0. To show that the limit does not exist, we will show that the function
approaches different values as ( x, y) approaches (0, 0) along different paths in R2 . To see this,
suppose that ( x, y) → (0, 0) along the positive x-axis, so that y = 0 along that path. Then

f ( x, y) =

xy
x 2 + y2

=

x0

along that path (since x > 0 in the denominator). But if ( x, y) → (0, 0) along the straight line
y = x through the origin, for x > 0, then we see that

Hence the limit does not exist.

Continuity can be defined similarly as in the single-variable case.
Definition 2.2. A real-valued function f ( x, y) with domain D in R2 is continuous at the
point (a, b) in D if
lim f ( x, y) = f (a, b). We say that f ( x, y) is a continuous function if
( x,y)→(a,b)

it is continuous at every point in its domain D .
Unless indicated otherwise, you can assume that all the functions we deal with are continuous. In fact, we can modify the function from Example 2.8 so that it is continuous on all
of R2 .
Example 2.9. Define a function f ( x, y) on all of R2 as follows:


if ( x, y) = (0, 0)
0
4
f ( x, y) =
y

if ( x, y) 6= (0, 0)
 2
x + y2

Then f ( x, y) is well-defined for all ( x, y) in R2 (i.e. there are no indeterminate forms for any
( x, y)), and we see that
lim

( x,y)→(a,b)

f ( x, y) =

b4
= f (a, b) for (a, b) 6= (0, 0).
a2 + b 2

So since
lim

( x,y)→(0,0)

f ( x, y) = 0 = f (0, 0) by Example 2.8,

then f ( x, y) is continuous on all of R2 .

2.2 Partial Derivatives
Now that we have an idea of what functions of several variables are, and what a limit of
such a function is, we can start to develop an idea of a derivative of a function of two or more
variables. We will start with the notion of a partial derivative.
Definition 2.3. Let f ( x, y) be a real-valued function with domain D in R2 , and let (a, b) be
a point in D . Then the partial derivative of f at (a, b) with respect to x, denoted by
∂f
(a, b), is defined as
∂x
∂f
f (a + h, b) − f (a, b)
(a, b) = lim
(2.2)
h→0
∂x
h
and the partial derivative of f at (a, b) with respect to y, denoted by
as

∂f
∂y

(a, b) = lim

h→0

∂f
∂y

(a, b), is defined

f (a, b + h) − f (a, b)
.
h

(2.3)

Note: The symbol ∂ is pronounced “del”.1
Recall that the derivative of a function f ( x) can be interpreted as the rate of change of
that function in the (positive) x direction. From the definitions above, we can see that the
partial derivative of a function f ( x, y) with respect to x or y is the rate of change of f ( x, y) in
the (positive) x or y direction, respectively. What this means is that the partial derivative of
a function f ( x, y) with respect to x can be calculated by treating the y variable as a constant,
and then simply differentiating f ( x, y) as if it were a function of x alone, using the usual
rules from single-variable calculus. Likewise, the partial derivative of f ( x, y) with respect to
y is obtained by treating the x variable as a constant and then differentiating f ( x, y) as if it
were a function of y alone.

Higher-order partial derivatives that are taken with respect to different variables, such

as ∂ y ∂ x and ∂ x ∂ y , are called mixed partial derivatives. Notice in the above example that

∂ y ∂x
∂2 f

∂2 f

∂x ∂ y

It turns that this will usually be the case. Specifically, whenever both

∂2 f
∂ y ∂x

and

are continuous at a point (a, b), then they are equal at that point.2 All the functions
we will deal with will have continuous partial derivatives of all orders, so you can assume in
the remainder of the text that
∂2 f
∂ y ∂x

=

∂2 f
∂x ∂ y

for all ( x, y) in the domain of f .

In other words, it doesn’t matter in which order you take partial derivatives. This applies
even to mixed partial derivatives of order 3 or higher.
The notation for partial derivatives varies. All of the following are equivalent:

In the previous section we mentioned that the partial derivatives ∂ x and ∂ y can be thought
of as the rate of change of a function z = f ( x, y) in the positive x and y directions, respectively.
dy
Recall that the derivative dx of a function y = f ( x) has a geometric meaning, namely as the
slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at the point ( x, f ( x)) in R2 . There is a similar
∂f
∂f
geometric meaning to the partial derivatives ∂ x and ∂ y of a function z = f ( x, y): given a
point (a, b) in the domain D of f ( x, y), the trace of the surface described by z = f ( x, y) in the
plane y = b is a curve in R3 through the point (a, b, f (a, b)), and the slope of the tangent line
∂f
∂f
L x to that curve at that point is ∂ x (a, b). Similarly, ∂ y (a, b) is the slope of the tangent line
L y to the trace of the surface z = f ( x, y) in the plane x = a (see Figure 2.3.1).

Since the derivative dx of a function y = f ( x) is used to find the tangent line to the graph
of f (which is a curve in R2 ), you might expect that partial derivatives can be used to define
a tangent plane to the graph of a surface z = f ( x, y). This indeed turns out to be the case.
First, we need a definition of a tangent plane. The intuitive idea is that a tangent plane “just
touches” a surface at a point. The formal definition mimics the intuitive notion of a tangent
line to a curve.
Definition 2.4. Let z = f ( x, y) be the equation of a surface S in R3 , and let P = (a, b, c) be
a point on S . Let T be a plane which contains the point P , and let Q = ( x, y, z) represent a
−−→
generic point on the surface S . If the (acute) angle between the vector PQ and the plane
T approaches zero as the point Q approaches P along the surface S , then we call T the
tangent plane to S at P .
Note that since two lines in R3 determine a plane, then the two tangent lines to the surface
z = f ( x, y) in the x and y directions described in Figure 2.3.1 are contained in the tangent
plane at that point, if the tangent plane exists at that point. The existence of those two

76

CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES

tangent lines does not by itself guarantee the existence of the tangent plane. It is possible
that if we take the trace of the surface in the plane x − y = 0 (which makes a 45◦ angle with
the positive x-axis), the resulting curve in that plane may have a tangent line which is not
in the plane determined by the other two tangent lines, or it may not have a tangent line
∂f
∂f
at all at that point. Luckily, it turns out4 that if ∂ x and ∂ y exist in a region around a point
(a, b) and are continuous at (a, b) then the tangent plane to the surface z = f ( x, y) will exist
at the point (a, b, f (a, b)). In this text, those conditions will always hold.
z

Suppose that we want an equation of the tangent plane T
to the surface z = f ( x, y) at a point (a, b, f (a, b)). Let L x and
L y be the tangent lines to the traces of the surface in the
planes y = b and x = a, respectively (as in Figure 2.3.2), and
suppose that the conditions for T to exist do hold. Then the
equation for T is

A ( x − a) + B( y − b) + C ( z − f (a, b)) = 0

Since the slope of L x is ∂ x (a, b), then the vector vx = (1, 0, ∂ x (a, b)) is

Example 2.13. Find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface z = x2 + y2 at the point
(1, 2, 5).
Solution: For the function f ( x, y) = x2 + y2 , we have
the tangent plane at the point (1, 2, 5) is

∂f
∂x

= 2 x and

∂f
∂y

= 2 y, so the equation of

2(1)( x − 1) + 2(2)( y − 2) − z + 5 = 0 , or
2x + 4 y − z − 5 = 0 .

In a similar fashion, it can be shown that if a surface is defined implicitly by an equation
of the form F ( x, y, z) = 0, then the tangent plane to the surface at a point (a, b, c) is given by
the equation
∂F
(a, b, c) ( x − a) + ∂∂Fy (a, b, c) ( y − b) + ∂∂Fz (a, b, c) ( z − c) = 0 .

Note that formula (2.6) is the special case of formula (2.7) where F ( x, y, z) = f ( x, y) − z.
Example 2.14. Find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface x2 + y2 + z2 = 9 at the
point (2, 2, −1).
Solution: For the function F ( x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2 − 9, we have
so the equation of the tangent plane at (2, 2, −1) is

∂F
∂x

= 2 x,

∂F

= 2 y, and

= 2 z,

2.4 Directional Derivatives and the Gradient
∂f

∂f

For a function z = f ( x, y), we learned that the partial derivatives ∂ x and ∂ y represent the
(instantaneous) rate of change of f in the positive x and y directions, respectively. What
about other directions? It turns out that we can find the rate of change in any direction
using a more general type of derivative called a directional derivative.
Definition 2.5. Let f ( x, y) be a real-valued function with domain D in R2 , and let (a, b) be a
point in D . Let v be a unit vector in R2 . Then the directional derivative of f at (a, b) in
the direction of v, denoted by D v f (a, b), is defined as

D v f (a, b) = lim

h→0

f ((a, b) + hv) − f (a, b)
h

(2.8)

Notice in the definition that we seem to be treating the point (a, b) as a vector, since we
are adding the vector hv to it. But this is just the usual idea of identifying vectors with their
terminal points, which the reader should be used to by now. If we were to write the vector v
as v = (v1 , v2 ), then
f (a + hv1 , b + hv2 ) − f (a, b)
.
(2.9)
D v f (a, b) = lim
h→0
h
∂f

∂f

From this we can immediately recognize that the partial derivatives ∂ x and ∂ y are special
cases of the directional derivative with v = i = (1, 0) and v = j = (0, 1), respectively. That is,
∂f
∂f
= D i f and ∂ y = D j f . Since there are many vectors with the same direction, we use a unit
∂x
vector in the definition, as that represents a “standard” vector for a given direction.
∂f
∂f
If f ( x, y) has continuous partial derivatives ∂ x and ∂ y (which will always be the case in
this text), then there is a simple formula for the directional derivative:
Theorem 2.2. Let f ( x, y) be a real-valued function with domain D in R2 such that the
∂f
∂f
partial derivatives ∂ x and ∂ y exist and are continuous in D . Let (a, b) be a point in D , and
let v = (v1 , v2 ) be a unit vector in R2 . Then

D v f (a, b) = v1

∂f
∂x

(a, b) + v2

∂f
∂y

(a, b) .

(2.10)

Proof: Note that if v = i = (1, 0) then the above formula reduces to D v f (a, b) =
which we know is true since D i f =

∂f

as we noted earlier. Similarly, for v = j = (0, 1) the

which is true since D j f =

∂f
.
∂y

So since i = (1, 0) and

j = (0, 1) are the only unit vectors in R with a zero component, then we need only show the
formula holds for unit vectors v = (v1 , v2 ) with v1 6= 0 and v2 6= 0. So fix such a vector v and
fix a number h 6= 0.

2.4 Directional Derivatives and the Gradient

Then

f (a + hv1 , b + hv2 ) − f (a, b) = f (a + hv1 , b + hv2 ) − f (a + hv1 , b) + f (a + hv1 , b) − f (a, b) . (2.11)
Since h 6= 0 and v2 6= 0, then hv2 6= 0 and thus any number c between b and b + hv2 can be
written as c = b +α hv2 for some number 0 < α < 1. So since the function f (a+ hv1 , y) is a realvalued function of y (since a + hv1 is a fixed number), then the Mean Value Theorem from
single-variable calculus can be applied to the function g( y) = f (a + hv1 , y) on the interval
[ b, b + hv2 ] (or [ b + hv2 , b] if one of h or v2 is negative) to find a number 0 < α < 1 such that
∂f
∂y

(a + hv1 , b + α hv2 ) = g ′ ( b + α hv2 ) =

g( b + hv2 ) − g( b) f (a + hv1 , b + hv2 ) − f (a + hv1 , b)
=
b + hv2 − b
hv2

and so

f (a + hv1 , b + hv2 ) − f (a + hv1 , b) = hv2

∂f
∂y

(a + hv1 , b + α hv2 ) .

By a similar argument, there exists a number 0 < β < 1 such that

f (a + hv1 , b) − f (a, b) = hv1

∂f
∂x

(a + β hv1 , b) .

Thus, by equation (2.11), we have
∂f

∂f

f (a + hv1 , b + hv2 ) − f (a, b)

= v2

∂f

A real-valued function z = f ( x, y) whose partial derivatives ∂ x and ∂ y exist and are continuous is called continuously differentiable. Assume that f ( x, y) is such a function and that
∇ f 6= 0. Let c be a real number in the range of f and let v be a unit vector in R2 which is
tangent to the level curve f ( x, y) = c (see Figure 2.4.1).

2.4 Directional Derivatives and the Gradient

81

The value of f ( x, y) is constant along a level curve, so since v is a tangent vector to this
curve, then the rate of change of f in the direction of v is 0, i.e. D v f = 0. But we know that
D v f = v · ∇ f = k v k k∇ f k cos θ , where θ is the angle between v and ∇ f . So since k v k = 1 then
D v f = k∇ f k cos θ . So since ∇ f 6= 0 then D v f = 0 ⇒ cos θ = 0 ⇒ θ = 90◦ . In other words, ∇ f ⊥ v,
which means that ∇ f is normal to the level curve.
In general, for any unit vector v in R2 , we still have D v f = k∇ f k cos θ , where θ is the angle
between v and ∇ f . At a fixed point ( x, y) the length k∇ f k is fixed, and the value of D v f then
varies as θ varies. The largest value that D v f can take is when cos θ = 1 (θ = 0◦ ), while the
smallest value occurs when cos θ = −1 (θ = 180◦ ). In other words, the value of the function
f increases the fastest in the direction of ∇ f (since θ = 0◦ in that case), and the value of
f decreases the fastest in the direction of −∇ f (since θ = 180◦ in that case). We have thus
proved the following theorem:
Theorem 2.4. Let f ( x, y) be a continuously differentiable real-valued function, with ∇ f 6= 0.
Then:
(a) The gradient ∇ f is normal to any level curve f ( x, y) = c.
(b) The value of f ( x, y) increases the fastest in the direction of ∇ f .
(c) The value of f ( x, y) decreases the fastest in the direction of −∇ f .
Example 2.16. In which direction does the function f ( x, y) = x y2 + x3 y increase the fastest
from the point (1, 2)? In which direction does it decrease the fastest?
Solution: Since ∇ f = (³y2 + 3 x´2 y, 2 x y + x3 ), then ∇ f (1, 2) = (10, 5) 6= 0. A unit vector

Though we proved Theorem 2.4 for functions of two variables, a similar argument can
be used to show that it also applies to functions of three or more variables. Likewise, the
directional derivative in the three-dimensional case can also be defined by the formula D v f =
v· ∇f .
Example 2.17. The temperature T of a solid is given by the function T ( x, y, z) = e− x + e−2 y +
e4 z , where x, y, z are space coordinates relative to the center of the solid. In which direction
from the point (1, 1, 1) will the temperature decrease the fastest?
Solution: Since ∇ f = (− e− x , −2 e−2 y , 4 e4 z ), then the temperature will decrease the fastest in
the direction of −∇ f (1, 1, 1) = ( e−1 , 2 e−2 , −4 e4 ).

2.5 Maxima and Minima
The gradient can be used to find extreme points of real-valued functions of several variables,
that is, points where the function has a local maximum or local minimum. We will consider
only functions of two variables; functions of three or more variables require methods using
linear algebra.
Definition 2.7. Let f ( x, y) be a real-valued function, and let (a, b) be a point in the domain
of f . We say that f has a local maximum at (a, b) if f ( x, y) ≤ f (a, b) for all ( x, y) inside some
disk of positive radius centered at (a, b), i.e. there is some sufficiently small r > 0 such that
f ( x, y) ≤ f (a, b) for all ( x, y) for which ( x − a)2 + ( y − b)2 < r 2 .
Likewise, we say that f has a local minimum at (a, b) if f ( x, y) ≥ f (a, b) for all ( x, y)
inside some disk of positive radius centered at (a, b).
If f ( x, y) ≤ f (a, b) for all ( x, y) in the domain of f , then f has a global maximum at
(a, b). If f ( x, y) ≥ f (a, b) for all ( x, y) in the domain of f , then f has a global minimum at
(a, b).
Suppose that (a, b) is a local maximum point for f ( x, y), and that the first-order partial
derivatives of f exist at (a, b). We know that f (a, b) is the largest value of f ( x, y) as ( x, y)
goes in all directions from the point (a, b), in some sufficiently small disk centered at (a, b).
In particular, f (a, b) is the largest value of f in the x direction (around the point (a, b)), that
is, the single-variable function g( x) = f ( x, b) has a local maximum at x = a. So we know that
∂f
∂f
g ′ (a) = 0. Since g ′ ( x) = ∂ x ( x, b), then ∂ x (a, b) = 0. Similarly, f (a, b) is the largest value of f
near (a, b) in the y direction and so

∂f
(a, b) = 0.
∂y

We thus have the following theorem:
∂f

∂f

Theorem 2.5. Let f ( x, y) be a real-valued function such that both ∂ x (a, b) and ∂ y (a, b) exist.
Then a necessary condition for f ( x, y) to have a local maximum or minimum at (a, b) is that
∇ f (a, b) = 0.
Note: Theorem 2.5 can be extended to apply to functions of three or more variables.
A point (a, b) where ∇ f (a, b) = 0 is called a critical point for the function f ( x, y). So given
∂f
a function f ( x, y), to find the critical points of f you have to solve the equations ∂ x ( x, y) = 0
∂f

and ∂ y ( x, y) = 0 simultaneously for ( x, y). Similar to the single-variable case, the necessary
condition that ∇ f (a, b) = 0 is not always sufficient to guarantee that a critical point is a local
maximum or minimum.
Example 2.18. The function f ( x, y) = x y has a critical point at (0, 0):
∂f
∂y

∂f
∂x

= y = 0 ⇒ y = 0, and

= x = 0 ⇒ x = 0, so (0, 0) is the only critical point. But clearly f does not have a local
maximum or minimum at (0, 0) since any disk around (0, 0) contains points ( x, y) where the
values of x and y have the same sign (so that f ( x, y) = x y > 0 = f (0, 0)) and different signs (so
that f ( x, y) = x y < 0 = f (0, 0)). In fact, along the path y = x in R2 , f ( x, y) = x2 , which has a

84

CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES

local minimum at (0, 0), while along the path y = − x we have f ( x, y) = − x2 , which has a local
maximum at (0, 0). So (0, 0) is an example of a saddle point, i.e. it is a local maximum in one
direction and a local minimum in another direction. The graph of f ( x, y) is shown in Figure
2.5.1, which is a hyperbolic paraboloid.

The following theorem gives sufficient conditions for a critical point to be a local maximum
or minimum of a smooth function (i.e. a function whose partial derivatives of all orders exist
and are continuous), which we will not prove here.6

∇ f (a, b) = 0). Define

(c) if D < 0, then f has neither a local minimum nor a local maximum at (a, b)

then the critical points ( x, y) are the common solutions of the equations

The first equation yields y = 3 x2 , substituting that into the second equation yields x −6 x2 = 0,

then the critical points ( x, y) are the common solutions of the equations
4( x − 2)3 + 2( x − 2 y) = 0
−4( x − 2 y) = 0

The second equation yields x = 2 y, substituting that into the first equation yields 4(2 y − 2)3 =
0, which has the solution y = 1, and so x = 2(1) = 2. Thus, (2, 1) is the only critical point.

and so the test fails. What can be done in this situation? Sometimes it is possible to examine
the function to see directly the nature of a critical point. In our case, we see that f ( x, y) ≥ 0
for all ( x, y), since f ( x, y) is the sum of fourth and second powers of numbers and hence must
be nonnegative. But we also see that f (2, 1) = 0. Thus f ( x, y) ≥ 0 = f (2, 1) for all ( x, y), and
hence (2, 1) is in fact a global minimum for f .

then the critical points are (0, 0) and all points ( x, y) on the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1.
To use Theorem 2.6, we need the second-order partial derivatives:
∂2 f
∂ x2
∂2 f
∂ y2
∂2 f
∂ y ∂x

= 2[1 − ( x2 + y2 ) − 2 x2 − 2 x2 (1 − ( x2 + y2 ))] e−( x

2

= 2[1 − ( x2 + y2 ) − 2 y2 − 2 y2 (1 − ( x2 + y2 ))] e−( x
= −4 x y[2 − ( x2 + y2 )] e−( x

+ y2 )

+ y2 )

+ y2 )

∂2 f

At (0, 0), we have D = 4 > 0 and ∂ x2 (0, 0) = 2 > 0, so (0, 0) is a local minimum. However, for
points ( x, y) on the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1, we have

D = (−4 x2 e−1 )(−4 y2 e−1 ) − (−4 x ye−1 )2 = 0
and so the test fails. If we look at the graph of f ( x, y), as shown in Figure 2.5.2, it looks like
we might have a local maximum for ( x, y) on the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1. If we switch to using
polar coordinates ( r, θ ) instead of ( x, y) in R2 , where r 2 = x2 + y2 , then we see that we can write
2
2
f ( x, y) as a function g( r ) of the variable r alone: g( r ) = r 2 e−r . Then g ′ ( r ) = 2 r (1 − r 2 ) e−r ,
so it has a critical point at r = 1, and we can check that g ′′ (1) = −4 e−1 < 0, so the Second
Derivative Test from single-variable calculus says that r = 1 is a local maximum. But r = 1
corresponds to the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1. Thus, the points ( x, y) on the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1
are local maximum points for f .

2.6 Unconstrained Optimization: Numerical Methods
The types of problems that we solved in the previous section were examples of unconstrained
optimization problems. That is, we tried to find local (and perhaps even global) maximum
and minimum points of real-valued functions f ( x, y), where the points ( x, y) could be any
points in the domain of f . The method we used required us to find the critical points of f ,
which meant having to solve the equation ∇ f = 0, which in general is a system of two equations in two unknowns ( x and y). While this was relatively simple for the examples we did,
in general this will not be the case. If the equations involve polynomials in x and y of degree
three or higher, or complicated expressions involving trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic functions, then solving even one such equation, let alone two, could be impossible by
elementary means.7
For example, if one of the equations that had to be solved was

x3 + 9 x − 2 = 0 ,
you may have a hard time getting the exact solutions. Trial
and error
would not help much,

especially since the only real solution turns out to be
such as this, the only choice may be to find a solution using some numerical method which
gives a sequence of numbers which converge to the actual solution. For example, Newton’s
method for solving equations f ( x) = 0, which you probably learned in single-variable calculus. In this section we will describe another method of Newton for finding critical points of
real-valued functions of two variables.
Let f ( x, y) be a smooth real-valued function, and define

Then the sequence of points ( xn , yn )∞
n=1 converges to a critical point. If there are several
critical points, then you will have to try different initial points to find them.
7 This is also a problem for the equivalent method (the Second Derivative Test) in single-variable calculus,
though one that is not usually emphasized.
8 There are also two nonreal, complex number solutions. Cubic polynomial equations in one variable can be
solved using Cardan’s formulas, which are not quite as simple as the familiar quadratic formula. See U SPENSKY
for more details. There are formulas for solving polynomial equations of degree 4, but it can be proved that there
is no general formula for solving equations for polynomials of degree five or higher.

Example 2.23. Find all local maxima and minima of f ( x, y) = x3 − x y − x + x y3 − y4 .

Solution: First calculate the necessary partial derivatives:

∂f

∂y

= 6 x y − 12 y2 ,

= −1 + 3 y 2

Notice that solving ∇ f = 0 would involve solving two third-degree polynomial equations in x
and y, which in this case can not be done easily.
We need to pick an initial point ( x0 , y0 ) for our algorithm. Looking at the graph of z = f ( x, y)
over a large region may help (see Figure 2.6.1 below), though it may be hard to tell where
the critical points are.

Notice in the formulas (2.14) that we divide by D , so we should pick an initial point where
D is not zero. And we can see that D (0, 0) = (0)(0) − (−1)2 = −1 6= 0, so take (0, 0) as our initial
point. Since it may take a large number of iterations of Newton’s algorithm to be sure that
we are close enough to the actual critical point, and since the computations are quite tedious,
we will let a computer do the computing. For this, we will write a simple program, using
the Java programming language, which will take a given initial point as a parameter and
then perform 100 iterations of Newton’s algorithm. In each iteration the new point will be
printed, so that we can see if there is convergence. The full code is shown in Listing 2.1.

CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES

To use this program, you should first save the code in Listing 2.1 in a plain text file called
newton.java. You will need the Java Development Kit9 to compile the code. In the directory

where newton.java is saved, run this command at a command prompt to compile the code:
javac newton.java

Then run the program with the initial point (0, 0) with this command:

Below is the output of the program using (0, 0) as the initial point, truncated to show the

As you can see, we appear to have converged fairly quickly (after only 8 iterations) to
what appears to be an actual critical point (up to Java’s level of precision), namely the point
(0.4711356343449874, −0.39636433796318005). It is easy to confirm that ∇ f = 0 at this
∂f

point, either by evaluating ∂ x and ∂ y at the point ourselves or by modifying our program to
also print the values of the partial derivatives at the point. It turns out that both partial
derivatives are indeed close enough to zero to be considered zero:
∂f

(0.4711356343449874, −0.39636433796318005) = 4.85722573273506 × 10−17

(0.4711356343449874, −0.39636433796318005) = −8.326672684688674 × 10−17
∂y
We also have D (0.4711356343449874, −0.39636433796318005) = −8.776075636032301 < 0,
so by Theorem 2.6 we know that (0.4711356343449874, −0.39636433796318005) is a saddle
point.

Since ∇ f consists of cubic polynomials, it seems likely that there may be three critical
points. The computer program makes experimenting with other initial points easy, and
trying different values does indeed lead to different sequences which converge:

(−0.6703832459238667, 0.42501465652420045), which means it is a critical point. And

(−0.6703832459238667, 0.42501465652420045) = −4.0222994755432 < 0

so we know that (−0.6703832459238667, 0.42501465652420045) is a local maximum. An
idea of what the graph of f looks like near that point is shown in Figure 2.6.2, which does
suggest a local maximum around that point.
Finally, running the computer program with the initial point (−5, −5) yields the critical
point (−7.540962756992551, −5.595509445899435), with D < 0 at that point, which makes
it a saddle point.

The derivation of Newton’s algorithm, and the proof that it converges (given a “reasonable” choice for the initial point) requires techniques beyond the scope of this text. See
R ALSTON and R ABINOWITZ for more detail and for discussion of other numerical methods.
Our description of Newton’s algorithm is the special two-variable case of a more general
algorithm that can be applied to functions of n ≥ 2 variables.
In the case of functions which have a global maximum or minimum, Newton’s algorithm
can be used to find those points. In general, global maxima and minima tend to be more
interesting than local versions, at least in practical applications. A maximization problem
can always be turned into a minimization problem (why?), so a large number of methods
have been developed to find the global minimum of functions of any number of variables.
This field of study is called nonlinear programming. Many of these methods are based on the
steepest descent technique, which is based on an idea that we discussed in Section 2.4. Recall
that the negative gradient −∇ f gives the direction of the fastest rate of decrease of a function
f . The crux of the steepest descent idea, then, is that starting from some initial point, you
move a certain amount in the direction of −∇ f at that point. Wherever that takes you

2.6 Unconstrained Optimization: Numerical Methods

95

becomes your new point, and you then just keep repeating that procedure until eventually
(hopefully) you reach the point where f has its smallest value. There is a “pure” steepest
descent method, and a multitude of variations on it that improve the rate of convergence,
ease of calculation, etc. In fact, Newton’s algorithm can be interpreted as a modified steepest
descent method. For more discussion of this, and of nonlinear programming in general, see
B AZARAA, S HERALI and S HETTY.

1. Recall Example 2.21 from the previous section, where we showed that the point (2, 1) was
a global minimum for the function f ( x, y) = ( x − 2)4 + ( x − 2 y)2 . Notice that our computer
program can be modified fairly easily to use this function (just change the return values
in the fx, fy, fxx, fyy and fxy function definitions to use the appropriate partial derivative).
Either modify that program or write one of your own in a programming language of your
choice to show that Newton’s algorithm does lead to the point (2, 1). First use the initial
point (0, 3), then use the initial point (3, 2), and compare the results. Make sure that your
program attempts to do 100 iterations of the algorithm. Did anything strange happen
when your program ran? If so, how do you explain it? (Hint: Something strange should
happen.)
2. There is a version of Newton’s algorithm for solving a system of two equations

f 1 ( x, y) = 0

and

f 2 ( x, y) = 0 ,

where f 1 ( x, y) and f 2 ( x, y) are smooth real-valued functions:

In Sections 2.5 and 2.6 we were concerned with finding maxima and minima of functions
without any constraints on the variables (other than being in the domain of the function).
What would we do if there were constraints on the variables? The following example illustrates a simple case of this type of problem.
Example 2.24. For a rectangle whose perimeter is 20 m, find the dimensions that will maximize the area.
Solution: The area A of a rectangle with width x and height y is A = x y. The perimeter P of
the rectangle is then given by the formula P = 2 x + 2 y. Since we are given that the perimeter
P = 20, this problem can be stated as:
Maximize : f ( x, y) = x y

given : 2 x + 2 y = 20

The reader is probably familiar with a simple method, using single-variable calculus, for
solving this problem. Since we must have 2 x + 2 y = 20, then we can solve for, say, y in
terms of x using that equation. This gives y = 10 − x, which we then substitute into f to get
f ( x, y) = x y = x(10 − x) = 10 x − x2 . This is now a function of x alone, so we now just have to
maximize the function f ( x) = 10 x − x2 on the interval [0, 10]. Since f ′ ( x) = 10 − 2 x = 0 ⇒ x = 5
and f ′′ (5) = −2 < 0, then the Second Derivative Test tells us that x = 5 is a local maximum
for f , and hence x = 5 must be the global maximum on the interval [0, 10] (since f = 0 at
the endpoints of the interval). So since y = 10 − x = 5, then the maximum area occurs for a
rectangle whose width and height both are 5 m.
Notice in the above example that the ease of the solution depended on being able to solve
for one variable in terms of the other in the equation 2 x + 2 y = 20. But what if that were not
possible (which is often the case)? In this section we will use a general method, called the
Lagrange multiplier method10 , for solving constrained optimization problems:
Maximize (or minimize) : f ( x, y) (or f ( x, y, z))
given : g( x, y) = c (or g( x, y, z) = c) for some constant c
The equation g( x, y) = c is called the constraint equation, and we say that x and y are constrained by g( x, y) = c. Points ( x, y) which are maxima or minima of f ( x, y) with the condition that they satisfy the constraint equation g( x, y) = c are called constrained maximum
or constrained minimum points, respectively. Similar definitions hold for functions of three
variables.
The Lagrange multiplier method for solving such problems can now be stated:
10 Named after the French mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813).

Theorem 2.7. Let f ( x, y) and g( x, y) be smooth functions, and suppose that c is a scalar
constant such that ∇ g( x, y) 6= 0 for all ( x, y) that satisfy the equation g( x, y) = c. Then to
solve the constrained optimization problem
Maximize (or minimize) : f ( x, y)
given : g( x, y) = c ,
find the points ( x, y) that solve the equation ∇ f ( x, y) = λ∇ g( x, y) for some constant λ (the
number λ is called the Lagrange multiplier). If there is a constrained maximum or minimum, then it must be such a point.
A rigorous proof of the above theorem requires use of the Implicit Function Theorem,
which is beyond the scope of this text.11 Note that the theorem only gives a necessary condition for a point to be a constrained maximum or minimum. Whether a point ( x, y) that
satisfies ∇ f ( x, y) = λ∇ g( x, y) for some λ actually is a constrained maximum or minimum can
sometimes be determined by the nature of the problem itself. For instance, in Example 2.24
it was clear that there had to be a global maximum.
So how can you tell when a point that satisfies the condition in Theorem 2.7 really is a
constrained maximum or minimum? The answer is that it depends on the constraint function g( x, y), together with any implicit constraints. It can be shown12 that if the constraint
equation g( x, y) = c (plus any hidden constraints) describes a bounded set B in R2 , then the
constrained maximum or minimum of f ( x, y) will occur either at a point ( x, y) satisfying
∇ f ( x, y) = λ∇ g( x, y) or at a “boundary” point of the set B.
In Example 2.24 the constraint equation 2 x + 2 y = 20 describes a line in R2 , which by itself
is not bounded. However, there are “hidden” constraints, due to the nature of the problem,
namely 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10, which cause that line to be restricted to a line segment in R2 (including
the endpoints of that line segment), which is bounded.
Example 2.25. For a rectangle whose perimeter is 20 m, use the Lagrange multiplier method
to find the dimensions that will maximize the area.
Solution: As we saw in Example 2.24, with x and y representing the width and height,
respectively, of the rectangle, this problem can be stated as:
Maximize : f ( x, y) = x y

given : g( x, y) = 2 x + 2 y = 20

Then solving the equation ∇ f ( x, y) = λ∇ g( x, y) for some λ means solving the equations

, namely:

The general idea is to solve for λ in both equations, then set those expressions equal (since
they both equal λ) to solve for x and y. Doing this we get

y

⇒

x= y ,

so now substitute either of the expressions for x or y into the constraint equation to solve for
x and y:
20 = g( x, y) = 2 x + 2 y = 2 x + 2 x = 4 x ⇒ x = 5 ⇒ y = 5
There must be a maximum area, since the minimum area is 0 and f (5, 5) = 25 > 0, so the
point (5, 5) that we found (called a constrained critical point) must be the constrained maximum.
∴ The maximum area occurs for a rectangle whose width and height both are 5 m.
Example 2.26. Find the points on the circle x2 + y2 = 80 which are closest to and farthest
from the point (1, 2).
Solution: The distance d from any point ( x, y) to the point (1, 2) is

d=

q
( x − 1)2 + ( y − 2)2 ,

and minimizing the distance is equivalent to minimizing the square of the distance. Thus
the problem can be stated as:
Maximize (and minimize) : f ( x, y) = ( x − 1)2 + ( y − 2)2
given : g( x, y) = x2 + y2 = 80

Solving ∇ f ( x, y) = λ∇ g( x, y) means solving the following equations:
2( x − 1) = 2λ x ,

2( y − 2) = 2λ y

Note that x 6= 0 since otherwise we would get −2 = 0 in the first equation. Similarly, y 6= 0.
So we can solve both equations for λ as follows:

y−2
x−1
= λ =
x
y

⇒

x y − y = x y − 2x

⇒

y = 2x

2.7 Constrained Optimization: Lagrange Multipliers

Substituting this into g( x, y) = x2 + y2 = 80 yields 5 x2 = 80,
so x = ±4. So the two constrained critical points are (4, 8) and
(−4, −8). Since f (4, 8) = 45 and f (−4, −8) = 125, and since there
must be points on the circle closest to and farthest from (1, 2),
then it must be the case that (4, 8) is the point on the circle closest to (1, 2) and (−4, −8) is the farthest from (1, 2) (see Figure
2.7.1).
Notice that since the constraint equation x2 + y2 = 80 describes
a circle, which is a bounded set in R2 , then we were guaranteed
that the constrained critical points we found were indeed the
constrained maximum and minimum.

The Lagrange multiplier method can be extended to functions of three variables.

Solution: Solve the equation ∇ f ( x, y, z) = λ∇ g( x, y, z):
1 = 2λ x

The first equation implies λ 6= 0 (otherwise we would have 1 = 0), so we can divide by λ in the
second equation to get y = 0 and we can divide by λ in the first and third equations to get
x = 21λ = z. Substituting these expressions into the constraint equation g( x, y, z) = x2 + y2 +

So far we have not attached any significance to the value of the Lagrange multiplier λ. We
needed λ only to find the constrained critical points, but made no use of its value. It turns
out that λ gives an approximation of the change in the value of the function f ( x, y) that we
wish to maximize or minimize, when the constant c in the constraint equation g( x, y) = c is
changed by 1.

CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES

For example, in Example 2.25 we showed that the constrained optimization problem
Maximize : f ( x, y) = x y

given : g( x, y) = 2 x + 2 y = 20

had the solution ( x, y) = (5, 5), and that λ = x/2 = y/2. Thus, λ = 2.5. In a similar fashion we
could show that the constrained optimization problem
Maximize : f ( x, y) = x y

given : g( x, y) = 2 x + 2 y = 21

has the solution ( x, y) = (5.25, 5.25). So we see that the value of f ( x, y) at the constrained
maximum increased from f (5, 5) = 25 to f (5.25, 5.25) = 27.5625, i.e. it increased by 2.5625
when we increased the value of c in the constraint equation g( x, y) = c from c = 20 to c = 21.
Notice that λ = 2.5 is close to 2.5625, that is,
λ ≈ ∆ f = f (new max. pt) − f (old max. pt) .

Finally, note that solving the equation ∇ f ( x, y) = λ∇ g( x, y) means having to solve a system
of two (possibly nonlinear) equations in three unknowns, which as we have seen before,
may not be possible to do. And the 3-variable case can get even more complicated. All of
this somewhat restricts the usefulness of Lagrange’s method to relatively simple functions.
Luckily there are many numerical methods for solving constrained optimization problems,
though we will not discuss them here.13

3 Multiple Integrals
3.1 Double Integrals
In single-variable calculus, differentiation and integration are thought of as inverse operations. For instance, to integrate a function f ( x) it is necessary to find the antiderivative of f ,
that is, another function F ( x) whose derivative is f ( x). Is there a similar way of defining integration of real-valued functions of two or more variables? The answer is yes, as we will see
shortly. Recall also that the definite integral of a nonnegative function f ( x) ≥ 0 represented
the area “under” the curve y = f ( x). As we will now see, the double integral of a nonnegative
real-valued function f ( x, y) ≥ 0 represents the volume “under” the surface z = f ( x, y).
Let f ( x, y) be a continuous function such that f ( x, y) ≥ 0 for all ( x, y) on the rectangle
R = {( x, y) : a ≤ x ≤ b, c ≤ y ≤ d } in R2 . We will often write this as R = [a, b] × [ c, d ]. For any
number x∗ in the interval [a, b], slice the surface z = f ( x, y) with the plane x = x∗ parallel to
the yz-plane. Then the trace of the surface in that plane is the curve f ( x∗, y), where x∗ is
fixed and only y varies. The area A under that curve (i.e. the area of the region between the
curve and the x y-plane) as y varies over the interval [ c, d ] then depends only on the value of
x∗. So using the variable x instead of x∗, let A ( x) be that area (see Figure 3.1.1).

Then A ( x) = c f ( x, y) d y since we are treating x as fixed, and only y varies. This makes
sense since for a fixed x the function f ( x, y) is a continuous function of y over the interval
[ c, d ], so we know that the area under the curve is the definite integral. The area A ( x) is a
function of x, so by the “slice” or cross-section method from single-variable calculus we know
that the volume V of the solid under the surface z = f ( x, y) but above the x y-plane over the

(3.1)

We will always refer to this volume as “the volume under the surface”. The above expression
uses what are called iterated integrals. First the function f ( x, y) is integrated as a function of y, treating the variable x as a constant (this is called integrating with respect to y).
That is what occurs in the “inner” integral between the square brackets in equation (3.1).
This is the first iterated integral. Once that integration is performed, the result is then an
expression involving only x, which can then be integrated with respect to x. That is what
occurs in the “outer” integral above (the second iterated integral). The final result is then
a number (the volume). This process of going through two iterations of integrals is called
double integration, and the last expression in equation (3.1) is called a double integral.
Notice that integrating f ( x, y) with respect to y is the inverse operation of taking the
partial derivative of f ( x, y) with respect to y. Also, we could just as easily have taken the
area of cross-sections under the surface which were parallel to the xz-plane, which would
then depend only on the variable y, so that the volume V would be

V =

¸

f ( x, y) dx d y .

(3.2)

It turns out that in general1 the order of the iterated integrals does not matter. Also, we will
usually discard the brackets and simply write

V =

Zd Zb
c

f ( x, y) dx d y ,

(3.3)

a

where it is understood that the fact that dx is written before d y means that the function
f ( x, y) is first integrated with respect to x using the “inner” limits of integration a and b,
and then the resulting function is integrated with respect to y using the “outer” limits of
integration c and d . This order of integration can be changed if it is more convenient.

function f ( x, y) represents the difference of the volume below the surface z = f ( x, y) but above
the x y-plane when f ( x, y) ≥ 0, and the volume above the surface but below the x y-plane when
f ( x, y) ≤ 0. Thus, our method of double integration by means of iterated integrals can be

3.2 Double Integrals Over a General Region
In the previous section we got an idea of what a double integral over a rectangle represents.
We can now define the double integral of a real-valued function f ( x, y) over more general
regions in R2 .
Suppose that we have a region R in the x y-plane that is bounded on the left by the vertical
line x = a, bounded on the right by the vertical line x = b (where a < b), bounded below by
a curve y = g 1 ( x), and bounded above by a curve y = g 2 ( x), as in Figure 3.2.1(a). We will
assume that g 1 ( x) and g 2 ( x) do not intersect on the open interval (a, b) (they could intersect
at the endpoints x = a and x = b, though).

This means that we take vertical slices in the region R between the curves y = g 1 ( x) and
y = g 2 ( x). The symbol d A is sometimes called an area element or infinitesimal, with the A
signifying area. Note that f ( x, y) is first integrated with respect to y, with functions of x as
the limits of integration. This makes sense since the result of the first iterated integral will
have to be a function of x alone, which then allows us to take the second iterated integral
with respect to x.
Similarly, if we have a region R in the x y-plane that is bounded on the left by a curve
x = h 1 ( y), bounded on the right by a curve x = h 2 ( y), bounded below by the horizontal line

106

CHAPTER 3. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

y = c, and bounded above by the horizontal line y = d (where c < d ), as in Figure 3.2.1(b)

subrectangles in Figure 3.2.5(a). In any such subrectangle [ xi , xi+1 ] × [ y j , y j+1 ], pick a point
( xi∗ , y j∗ ). Then the volume under the surface z = f ( x, y) over that subrectangle is approximately f ( xi∗ , y j∗ ) ∆ xi ∆ y j , where ∆ xi = xi+1 − xi , ∆ y j = y j+1 − y j , and f ( xi∗ , y j∗ ) is the height and

Double integral over a general region R

A similar definition can be made for a function f ( x, y) that is not necessarily always nonnegative: just replace each mention of volume by the negative volume in the description
above when f ( x, y) < 0. In the case of a region of the type shown in Figure 3.2.1, using the defÎ
f ( x, y) d A
inition of the Riemann integral from single-variable calculus, our definition of
R

reduces to a sequence of two iterated integrals.
Finally, the region R does not have to be bounded. We can evaluate improper double
integrals (i.e. over an unbounded region, or over a region which contains points where the
function f ( x, y) is not defined) as a sequence of iterated improper single-variable integrals.

CHAPTER 3. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

3.3 Triple Integrals
Our definition of a double integral of a real-valued function f ( x, y) over a region R in R2 can
be extended to define a triple integral of a real-valued function f ( x, y, z) over a solid S in R3 .
We simply proceed as before: the solid S can be enclosed in some rectangular parallelepiped,
which is then divided into subparallelepipeds. In each subparallelepiped inside S , with sides
of lengths ∆ x, ∆ y and ∆ z, pick a point ( x∗ , y∗ , z∗ ). Then define the triple integral of f ( x, y, z)
Ð
over S , denoted by
f ( x, y, z) dV , by
S

Ñ

f ( x, y, z) dV = lim

S

XXX

f ( x∗ , y∗ , z∗ ) ∆ x ∆ y ∆ z ,

(3.7)

where the limit is over all divisions of the rectangular parallelepiped enclosing S into subparallelepipeds whose largest diagonal is going to 0, and the triple summation is over all the
subparallelepipeds inside S . It can be shown that this limit does not depend on the choice
of the rectangular parallelepiped enclosing S . The symbol dV is often called the volume
element.
Physically, what does the triple integral represent? We saw that a double integral could
be thought of as the volume under a two-dimensional surface. It turns out that the triple
integral simply generalizes this idea: it can be thought of as representing the hypervolume
under a three-dimensional hypersurface w = f ( x, y, z) whose graph lies in R4 . In general,
the word “volume” is often used as a general term to signify the same concept for any ndimensional object (e.g. length in R1 , area in R2 ). It may be hard to get a grasp on the concept
of the “volume” of a four-dimensional object, but at least we now know how to calculate that
volume!
In the case where S is a rectangular parallelepiped [ x1 , x2 ] × [ y1 , y2 ] × [ z1 , z2 ], that is, S =
{( x, y, z) : x1 ≤ x ≤ x2 , y1 ≤ y ≤ y2 , z1 ≤ z ≤ z2 }, the triple integral is a sequence of three iterated
integrals, namely
Ñ
Z z2 Z y2 Z x2
f ( x, y, z) dV =
f ( x, y, z) dx d y dz ,
(3.8)
z1

S

where the order of integration does not matter. This is the simplest case.
A more complicated case is where S is a solid which is bounded below by a surface z =
g 1 ( x, y), bounded above by a surface z = g 2 ( x, y), y is bounded between two curves h 1 ( x) and
h 2 ( x), and x varies between a and b. Then

f ( x, y, z) dz d y dx .

(3.9)

g 1 ( x,y)

Notice in this case that the first iterated integral will result in a function of x and y (since its
limits of integration are functions of x and y), which then leaves you with a double integral of

3.3 Triple Integrals

a type that we learned how to evaluate in Section 3.2. There are, of course, many variations
on this case (for example, changing the roles of the variables x, y, z), so as you can probably
tell, triple integrals can be quite tricky. At this point, just learning how to evaluate a triple
integral, regardless of what it represents, is the most important thing. We will see some
other ways in which triple integrals are used later in the text.

Since the function being integrated is the constant 1, then the above triple integral reduces
to a double integral of the types that we considered in the previous section if the solid is
bounded above by some surface z = f ( x, y) and bounded below by the x y-plane z = 0. There
are many other possibilities. For example, the solid could be bounded below and above by
surfaces z = g 1 ( x, y) and z = g 2 ( x, y), respectively, with y bounded between two curves h 1 ( x)
and h 2 ( x), and x varies between a and b. Then

3.4 Numerical Approximation of Multiple Integrals
As you have seen, calculating multiple integrals is tricky even for simple functions and
regions. For complicated functions, it may not be possible to evaluate one of the iterated integrals in a simple closed form. Luckily there are numerical methods for approximating the
value of a multiple integral. The method we will discuss is called the Monte Carlo method.
The idea behind it is based on the concept of the average value of a function, which you
learned in single-variable calculus. Recall that for a continuous function f ( x), the average
value f¯ of f over an interval [a, b] is defined as

f¯ =

1
b−a

Zb

f ( x) dx .

(3.11)

a

The quantity b − a is the length of the interval [a, b], which can be thought of as the
“volume” of the interval. Applying the same reasoning to functions of two or three variables,
we define the average value of f ( x, y) over a region R to be
Ï
1
f¯ =
f ( x, y) d A ,
(3.12)
A (R )
R

where A (R ) is the area of the region R , and we define the average value of f ( x, y, z) over a
solid S to be
Ñ
1
¯
f ( x, y, z) dV ,
(3.13)
f =
V (S )
S

where V (S ) is the volume of the solid S . Thus, for example, we have
Ï
f ( x, y) d A = A (R ) f¯ .

(3.14)

R

The average value of f ( x, y) over R can be thought of as representing the sum of all the
values of f divided by the number of points in R . Unfortunately there are an infinite number
(in fact, uncountably many) points in any region, i.e. they can not be listed in a discrete
sequence. But what if we took a very large number N of random points in the region R
(which can be generated by a computer) and then took the average of the values of f for
those points, and used that average as the value of f¯? This is exactly what the Monte Carlo
method does. So in formula (3.14) the approximation we get is
s
Ï
f 2 − ( f¯)2
f ( x, y) d A ≈ A (R ) f¯ ± A (R )

CHAPTER 3. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

with the sums taken over the N random points ( x1 , y1 ), . . ., ( xN , yN ). The ± “error term” in
formula (3.15) does not really provide hard bounds on the approximation. It represents a
single standard deviation from the expected value of the integral. That is, it provides a likely
bound on the error. Due to its use of random points, the Monte Carlo method is an example
of a probabilistic method (as opposed to deterministic methods such as Newton’s method,
which use a specific formula for generating points).
For example, we can use formula (3.15) to approximate the volume V under the plane
z = 8 x + 6 y over the rectangle R = [0, 1] × [0, 2]. In Example 3.1 in Section 3.1, we showed
that the actual volume is 20. Below is a code listing (montecarlo.java) for a Java program
that calculates the volume, using a number of points N that is passed on the command line
as a parameter.
//Program to approximate the double integral of f(x,y)=8x+6y
//over the rectangle [0,1]x[0,2].
public class montecarlo {
public static void main(String[] args) {
//Get the number N of random points as a command-line parameter
int N = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
double x = 0; //x-coordinate of a random point
double y = 0; //y-coordinate of a random point
double f = 0.0; //Value of f at a random point
double mf = 0.0; //Mean of the values of f
double mf2 = 0.0; //Mean of the values of f^2
for (int i=0;i<N;i++) { //Get the random coordinates
x = Math.random(); //x is between 0 and 1
y = 2 * Math.random(); //y is between 0 and 2
f = 8*x + 6*y; //Value of the function
mf = mf + f; //Add to the sum of the f values
mf2 = mf2 + f*f; //Add to the sum of the f^2 values
}
mf = mf/N; //Compute the mean of the f values
mf2 = mf2/N; //Compute the mean of the f^2 values
System.out.println("N = " + N + ": integral = " + vol()*mf + " +/- "
+ vol()*Math.sqrt((mf2 - Math.pow(mf,2))/N)); //Print the result
}
//The volume of the rectangle [0,1]x[0,2]
public static double vol() {
return 1*2;
}
}

The results of running this program with various numbers of random points (e.g. java
montecarlo 100) are shown below:

N = 1000000: 20.000866994982314 +/- 0.008321168748642816

As you can see, the approximation is fairly good. As N → ∞, it can be shown
p that the
Monte Carlo approximation converges to the actual volume (on the order of O ( N ), in computational complexity terminology).
In the above example the region R was a rectangle. To use the Monte Carlo method for
a nonrectangular (bounded) region R , only a slight modification is needed. Pick a rectangle
R̃ that encloses R , and generate random points in that rectangle as before. Then use those
points in the calculation of f¯ only if they are inside R . There is no need to calculate the area
of R for formula (3.15) in this case, since the exclusion of points not inside R allows you to
use the area of the rectangle R̃ instead, similar to before.
For instance, in Example 3.4 we showed that the volume under the surface z = 8 x + 6 y
over the nonrectangular region R = {( x, y) : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 2 x2 } is 6.4. Since the rectangle
R̃ = [0, 1] × [0, 2] contains R , we can use the same program as before, with the only change
being a check to see if y < 2 x2 for a random point ( x, y) in [0, 1] × [0, 2]. Listing 3.2 below
contains the code (montecarlo2.java):
//Program to approximate the double integral of f(x,y)=8x+6y over the
//region bounded by x=0, x=1, y=0, and y=2x^2
public class montecarlo2 {

for (int i=0;i<N;i++) { //Get the random coordinates

if (y < 2*Math.pow(x,2)) { //The point is in the region
f = 8*x + 6*y; //Value of the function
mf = mf + f; //Add to the sum of the f values
mf2 = mf2 + f*f; //Add to the sum of the f^2 values

}

To use the Monte Carlo method to evaluate triple integrals, you will need to generate
random triples ( x, y, z) in a parallelepiped, instead of random pairs ( x, y) in a rectangle, and
use the volume of the parallelepiped instead of the area of a rectangle in formula (3.15) (see
Exercise 2). For a more detailed discussion of numerical integration methods, see P RESS et
al.

3.5 Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals
Given the difficulty of evaluating multiple integrals, the reader may be wondering if it is
possible to simplify those integrals using a suitable substitution for the variables. The answer is yes, though it is a bit more complicated than the substitution method which you
learned in single-variable calculus.
Recall that if you are given, for example, the definite integral
Z2
1

x3

p

x2 − 1 dx ,

then you would make the substitution

u = x2 − 1 ⇒ x2 = u + 1

du = 2 x dx
which changes the limits of integration

x=1 ⇒ u=0

x=2 ⇒ u=3
so that we get

Let us take a different look at what happened when we did that substitution, which will give
some motivation for how substitution works in multiple integrals. First, we let u = x2 − 1.
On the interval of integration [1, 2], the function x 7→ x2 − 1 is strictly increasing (and maps
[1, 2] onto [0, 3]) and hence has an inverse function (defined on the interval [0, 3]). That is,
on [0, 3] we can define x as a function of u, namely

x = g( u) =

p

u+1 .

p
Then substituting that expression for x into the function f ( x) = x3 x2 − 1 gives
p
f ( x) = f ( g( u)) = ( u + 1)3/2 u ,

118

CHAPTER 3. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

and we see that

dx
= g ′ ( u) ⇒ dx = g ′ ( u) du
du
dx = 21 ( u + 1)−1/2 du ,
so since

g(0) = 1 ⇒ 0 = g−1 (1)

g(3) = 2 ⇒ 3 = g−1 (2)

then performing the substitution as we did earlier gives

Z g−1 (2)
g−1 (1)

f ( g( u)) g ′ ( u) du .

In general, if x = g( u) is a one-to-one, differentiable function from an interval [ c, d ] (which
you can think of as being on the “ u-axis”) onto an interval [a, b] (on the x-axis), which means
that g ′ ( u) 6= 0 on the interval ( c, d ), so that a = g( c) and b = g( d ), then c = g−1 (a) and d =
g−1 ( b), and

This is called the change of variable formula for integrals of single-variable functions, and it
is what you were implicitly using when doing integration by substitution. This formula turns
out to be a special case of a more general formula which can be used to evaluate multiple
integrals. We will state the formulas for double and triple integrals involving real-valued
functions of two and three variables, respectively. We will assume that all the functions
involved are continuously differentiable and that the regions and solids involved all have
“reasonable” boundaries. The proof of the following theorem is beyond the scope of the text.2

Theorem 3.1. Change of Variables Formula for Multiple Integrals

a region R in the x y-plane such that the determinant

We use the notation d A ( x, y) and d A ( u, v) to denote the area element in the ( x, y) and ( u, v)
coordinates, respectively.
Similarly, if x = x( u, v, w), y = y( u, v, w) and z = z( u, v, w) define a one-to-one mapping of
a solid S ′ in uvw-space onto a solid S in x yz-space such that the determinant

S

S′

The determinant J ( u, v) in formula (3.18) is called the Jacobian of x and y with respect
to u and v, and is sometimes written as

J ( u, v) =

∂( x, y)
∂( u, v)

.

(3.22)

Similarly, the Jacobian J ( u, v, w) of three variables is sometimes written as

J ( u, v, w) =

∂( x, y, z)
∂( u, v, w)

.

(3.23)

Notice that formula (3.19) is saying that d A ( x, y) = | J ( u, v) | d A ( u, v), which you can think of
as a two-variable version of the relation dx = g ′ ( u) du in the single-variable case.
The following example shows how the change of variables formula is used.

Solution: First, note that evaluating this double integral without using substitution is probably impossible, at least in a closed form. By looking at the numerator and denominator of
the exponent of e, we will try the substitution u = x − y and v = x + y. To use the change of
variables formula (3.19), we need to write both x and y in terms of u and v. So solving for
x and y gives x = 21 ( u + v) and y = 12 (v − u). In Figure 3.5.1 below, we see how the mapping
x = x( u, v) = 21 ( u + v), y = y( u, v) = 21 (v − u) maps the region R ′ onto R in a one-to-one manner.

3.6 Application: Center of Mass

Recall from single-variable calculus that for a region
R = {( x, y) : a ≤ x ≤ b, 0 ≤ y ≤ f ( x)} in R2 that represents
a thin, flat plate (see Figure 3.6.1), where f ( x) is a continuous function on [a, b], the center of mass of R has
coordinates ( x̄, ȳ) given by

assuming that R has uniform density, i.e the mass of R is uniformly distributed over the
region. In this case the area M of the region is considered the mass of R (the density is
constant, and taken as 1 for simplicity).
In the general case where the density of a region (or lamina) R is a continuous function
δ = δ( x, y) of the coordinates ( x, y) of points inside R (where R can be any region in R2 ) the
coordinates ( x̄, ȳ) of the center of mass of R are given by

(3.29)

R

The quantities M x and M y are called the moments (or first moments) of the region R about
the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The quantity M is the mass of the region R . To see this,
think of taking a small rectangle inside R with dimensions ∆ x and ∆ y close to 0. The mass
of that rectangle is approximately δ( x∗ , y∗ )∆ x ∆ y, for some point ( x∗ , y∗ ) in that rectangle.
Then the mass of R is the limit of the sums of the masses of all such rectangles inside R as
Î
the diagonals of the rectangles approach 0, which is the double integral δ( x, y) d A .
R

Note that the formulas in (3.27) represent a special case when δ( x, y) = 1 throughout R in
the formulas in (3.29).

Example 3.13. Find the center of mass of the region R = {( x, y) : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 2 x2 }, if the
density function at ( x, y) is δ( x, y) = x + y.

when the density is uniform (it is easy to use the formulas in (3.27) to show that ( x̄, ȳ) = 34 , 53
in that case). This makes sense since the density function δ( x, y) = x + y increases as ( x, y)
approaches that upper corner, where there is quite a bit of area.
In the special case where the density function δ( x, y) is a constant function on the region
R , the center of mass ( x̄, ȳ) is called the centroid of R .

126

CHAPTER 3. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

The formulas for the center of mass of a region in R2 can be generalized to a solid S in R3 .
Let S be a solid with a continuous mass density function δ( x, y, z) at any point ( x, y, z) in S .
Then the center of mass of S has coordinates ( x̄, ȳ, z̄), where

x̄ =

ȳ =

M xz

M =

zδ( x, y, z) dV , (3.31)

S

δ( x, y, z) dV .

(3.32)

S

In this case, M yz , M xz and M x y are called the moments (or first moments) of S around the
yz-plane, xz-plane and x y-plane, respectively. Also, M is the mass of S .
Example 3.14. Find the center of mass of the solid S = {( x, y, z) : z ≥ 0, x2 + y2 + z2 ≤ a2 }, if
the density function at ( x, y, z) is δ( x, y, z) = 1.
Solution: The solid S is just the upper hemisphere inside the sphere
of radius a centered at the origin (see Figure 3.6.3). So since the
density function is a constant and S is symmetric about the z-axis,
then it is clear that x̄ = 0 and ȳ = 0, so we need only find z̄. We have

CHAPTER 3. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

3.7 Application: Probability and Expected Value
In this section we will briefly discuss some applications of multiple integrals in the field of
probability theory. In particular we will see ways in which multiple integrals can be used to
calculate probabilities and expected values.

Probability
Suppose that you have a standard six-sided (fair) die, and you let a variable X represent
the value rolled. Then the probability of rolling a 3, written as P ( X = 3), is 16 , since there
are six sides on the die and each one is equally likely to be rolled, and hence in particular
the 3 has a one out of six chance of being rolled. Likewise the probability of rolling at most a
3, written as P ( X ≤ 3), is 36 = 21 , since of the six numbers on the die, there are three equally
likely numbers (1, 2, and 3) that are less than or equal to 3. Note that P ( X ≤ 3) = P ( X =
1) + P ( X = 2) + P ( X = 3). We call X a discrete random variable on the sample space (or
probability space) Ω consisting of all possible outcomes. In our case, Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. An
event A is a subset of the sample space. For example, in the case of the die, the event X ≤ 3
is the set {1, 2, 3}.
Now let X be a variable representing a random real number in the interval (0, 1). Note
that the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1 is not a discrete (or countable) set of values,
i.e. it can not be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of positive integers.3 In
this case, for any real number x in (0, 1), it makes no sense to consider P ( X = x) since it must
be 0 (why?). Instead, we consider the probability P ( X ≤ x), which is given by P ( X ≤ x) = x.
The reasoning is this: the interval (0, 1) has length 1, and for x in (0, 1) the interval (0, x)
has length x. So since X represents a random number in (0, 1), and hence is uniformly
distributed over (0, 1), then

P ( X ≤ x) =

length of (0, x)

=

length of (0, 1)
1

We call X a continuous random variable on the sample space Ω = (0, 1). An event A is a
subset of the sample space. For example, in our case the event X ≤ x is the set (0, x).
In the case of a discrete random variable, we saw how the probability of an event was the
sum of the probabilities of the individual outcomes comprising that event (e.g. P ( X ≤ 3) =
P ( X = 1) + P ( X = 2) + P ( X = 3) in the die example). For a continuous random variable, the
probability of an event will instead be the integral of a function, which we will now describe.
Let X be a continuous real-valued random variable on a sample space Ω in R. For sim3 For a proof see p. 9-10 in K AMKE , E., Theory of Sets, New York: Dover, 1950.

In addition to individual random variables, we can consider jointly distributed random
variables. For this, we will let X , Y and Z be three real-valued continuous random variables
defined on the same sample space Ω in R (the discussion for two random variables is similar).
Then the joint distribution function F of X , Y and Z is given by

F ( x, y, z) = P ( X ≤ x, Y ≤ y, Z ≤ z) ,

for −∞ < x, y, z < ∞.

(3.46)

f ( x, y, z) dx d y dz = 1 ,

(3.48)

then we call f the joint probability density function (or joint p.d.f. for short) for X , Y and Z .
In general, for a 1 < b 1 , a 2 < b 2 , a 3 < b 3 , we have

P (a 1 < X ≤ b 1 , a 2 < Y ≤ b 2 , a 3 < Z ≤ b 3 ) =

with the ≤ and < symbols interchangeable in any combination. A triple integral, then, can
be thought of as representing a probability (for a function f which is a p.d.f.).
Example 3.17. Let a, b, and c be real numbers selected randomly from the interval (0, 1).
What is the probability that the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has at least one real solution x?
Solution: We know by the quadratic formula that there is at least
one real solution if b2 − 4ac ≥ 0. So we need to calculate P ( b2 − 4ac ≥
0). We will use three jointly distributed random variables to do this.
First, since 0 < a, b, c < 1, we have
p p
b2 − 4ac ≥ 0 ⇔ 0 < 4ac ≤ b2 < 1 ⇔ 0 < 2 a c ≤ b < 1 ,

where the last relation holds for all 0 < a, c < 1 such that

Considering a, b and c as real variables, the region R in the ac-plane where the above
relation holds is given by R = {(a, c) : 0 < a < 1, 0 < c < 1, 0 < c < 41a }, which we can see is a
union of two regions R 1 and R 2 , as in Figure 3.7.1 above.
Now let X , Y and Z be continuous random variables, each representing a randomly selected real number from the interval (0, 1) (think of X , Y and Z representing a, b and c,

132

respectively). Then, similar to how we showed that f ( x) = 1 is the p.d.f. of the uniform distribution on (0, 1), it can be shown that f ( x, y, z) = 1 for x, y, z in (0, 1)
(0 elsewhere) is the joint p.d.f. of X , Y and Z . Now,
p p
P ( b2 − 4ac ≥ 0) = P ((a, c) ∈ R, 2 a c ≤ b < 1) ,

p p
so this probability is the triple integral of f (a, b, c) = 1 as b varies from 2 a c to 1 and as
(a, c) varies over the region R . Since R can be divided into two regions R 1 and R 2 , then the
required triple integral can be split into a sum of two triple integrals, using vertical slices in

of X as it varies over its sample space. If X is a discrete random variable, then
X

with the sum being taken over all elements x of the sample space. For example, if X represents the number rolled on a six-sided die, then

Example 3.18. If you were to pick n > 2 random real numbers from the interval (0, 1), what

Solution: Let U1 , . . . ,Un be n continuous random variables, each representing a randomly
selected real number from (0, 1), i.e. each has the uniform distribution on (0, 1). Define
random variables X and Y by

X = min(U1 , . . . ,Un )

and Y = max(U1 , . . . ,Un ) .

4 Line and Surface Integrals
4.1 Line Integrals
In single-variable calculus you learned how to integrate a real-valued function f ( x) over an
interval [a, b] in R1 . This integral (usually called a Riemann integral) can be thought of as
an integral over a path in R1 , since an interval (or collection of intervals) is really the only
kind of “path” in R1 . You may also recall that if f ( x) represented the force applied along the
x-axis to an object at position x in [a, b], then the work W done in moving that object from
position x = a to x = b was defined as the integral:
Zb
W =
f ( x) dx
a

In this section, we will see how to define the integral of a function (either real-valued or
vector-valued) of two variables over a general path (i.e. a curve) in R2 . This definition will
be motivated by the physical notion of work. We will begin with real-valued functions of two
variables.
In physics, the intuitive idea of work is that
Work = Force × Distance .
Suppose that we want to find the total amount W of work done in moving an object along a
curve C in R2 with a smooth parametrization x = x( t), y = y( t), a ≤ t ≤ b, with a force f ( x, y)
which varies with the position ( x, y) of the object and is applied in the direction of motion
along C (see Figure 4.1.1 below).

We will assume for now that the function f ( x, y) is continuous and real-valued, so we only
consider the magnitude of the force. Partition the interval [a, b] as follows:

a = t 0 < t 1 < t 2 < · · · < t n−1 < t n = b , for some integer n ≥ 2

135

136

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

As we can see from Figure 4.1.1, over
q a typical subinterval [ t i , t i+1 ] the distance ∆ s i traveled

along the curve is approximately ∆ xi 2 + ∆ yi 2 , by the Pythagorean Theorem. Thus, if the
subinterval is small enough then the work done in moving the object along that piece of the
curve is approximately
Force × Distance ≈ f ( xi∗ , yi∗ )

The integral on the right side of the above equation gives us our idea of how to define,
for any real-valued function f ( x, y), the integral of f ( x, y) along the curve C , called a line
integral:
Definition 4.1. For a real-valued function f ( x, y) and a curve C in R2 , parametrized by

ds = s ( t) dt = x ′ ( t)2 + y ′ ( t)2 dt ,

by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
R
For a general real-valued function f ( x, y), what does the line integral C f ( x, y) ds represent? The preceding discussion of ds gives us a clue. You can think of differentials as
infinitesimal lengths. So if you think of f ( x, y) as the height of a picket fence along C , then
f ( x, y) ds can be thought of as approximately the area of a section of that fence over some
R
infinitesimally small section of the curve, and thus the line integral C f ( x, y) ds is the total
area of that picket fence (see Figure 4.1.2).

Solution: We will use the right circular cylinder with base circle C
given by x2 + y2 = r 2 and with height h in the positive z direction
(see Figure 4.1.3). Parametrize C as follows:

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

Note in Example 4.1 that if we had traversed the circle C twice, i.e. let t vary from 0 to
4π, then we would have gotten an area of 4π rh, i.e. twice the desired area, even though the
curve itself is still the same (namely, a circle of radius r ). Also, notice that we traversed the
circle in the counter-clockwise direction. If we had gone in the clockwise direction, using the
parametrization

x = x( t) = r cos(2π − t) ,

y = y( t) = r sin(2π − t) ,

0 ≤ t ≤ 2π ,

(4.8)

then it is easy to verify (see Exercise 12) that the value of the line integral is unchanged.
In general, it can be shown (see Exercise 15) that reversing the direction in which a curve
R
C is traversed leaves C f ( x, y) ds unchanged, for any f ( x, y). If a curve C has a parametrization x = x( t), y = y( t), a ≤ t ≤ b, then denote by −C the same curve as C but traversed in the
opposite direction. Then −C is parametrized by

x = x( a + b − t) ,
and we have

In the derivation of the formula for a line integral, we used the idea of work as force
multiplied by distance. However, we know that force is actually a vector. So it would be
helpful to develop a vector form for a line integral. For this, suppose that we have a function
f( x, y) defined on R2 by
f( x, y) = P ( x, y) i + Q ( x, y) j
for some continuous real-valued functions P ( x, y) and Q ( x, y) on R2 . Such a function f is
called a vector field on R2 . It is defined at points in R2 , and its values are vectors in R2 . For
a curve C with a smooth parametrization x = x( t), y = y( t), a ≤ t ≤ b, let
r( t) = x( t) i + y( t) j

line integral. This leads us to the following definition:

We use the notation d r = r ′ ( t) dt = dx i + d y j to denote the differential of the vector-valued
function r. The line integral in Definition 4.2 is often called a line integral of a vector field
to distinguish it from the line integral in Definition 4.1 which is called a line integral of a
scalar field. For convenience we will often write

where it is understood that the line integral along C is being applied to both P and Q . The
quantity P ( x, y) dx + Q ( x, y) d y is known as a differential form. For a real-valued function
F ( x, y), the differential of F is dF = ∂∂Fx dx + ∂∂Fy d y. A differential form P ( x, y) dx + Q ( x, y) d y
is called exact if it equals dF for some function F ( x, y).
Recall that if the points on a curve C have position vector r( t) = x( t) i + y( t) j, then r ′ ( t) is a
tangent vector to C at the point ( x( t), y( t)) in the direction of increasing t (which we call the
direction of C ). Since C is a smooth curve, then r ′ ( t) 6= 0 on [a, b] and hence

So in both cases, if the vector field f( x, y) = ( x2 + y2 ) i + 2 x y j represents the force moving an
object from (0, 0) to (1, 2) along the given curve C , then the work done is 13

you to think that work (and more generally, the line integral of a vector field) is independent
of the path taken. However, as we will see in the next section, this is not always the case.

Line integral notation varies quite a bit. For example, in physics it is common to see the

notation a f · d l, where it is understood that the limits of integration a and b are for the
underlying parameter t of the curve, and the letter l signifies length. Also, the formulation
R
C f · T ds from Theorem 4.1 is often preferred in physics since it emphasizes the idea of
integrating the tangential component f · T of f in the direction of T (i.e. in the direction of C ),
which is a useful physical interpretation of line integrals.

fields), reversing the direction in which the integral is taken along a curve does not change
the value of the line integral:

For line integrals of vector fields, however, the value does change. To see this, let f( x, y) =

C be a smooth curve parametrized by x = x( t), y = y( t), a ≤ t ≤ b, with position vector r( t) =
x( t) i + y( t) j (we will usually abbreviate this by saying that C : r( t) = x( t) i + y( t) j is a smooth
curve). We know that the curve −C traversed in the opposite direction is parametrized by
x = x(a + b − t), y = y(a + b − t), a ≤ t ≤ b. Then

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

The above formula can be interpreted in terms of the work done by a force f( x, y) (treated
as a vector) moving an object along a curve C : the total work performed moving the object
along C from its initial point to its terminal point, and then back to the initial point moving
backwards along the same path, is zero. This is because when force is considered as a vector,
direction is accounted for.
The preceding discussion shows the importance of always taking the direction of the curve
into account when using line integrals of vector fields. For this reason, the curves in line
integrals are sometimes referred to as directed curves or oriented curves.
Recall that our definition of a line integral required that we have a parametrization x =
x( t), y = y( t), a ≤ t ≤ b for the curve C . But as we know, any curve has infinitely many
parametrizations. So could we get a different value for a line integral using some other
parametrization of C , say, x = x̃( u), y = ỹ( u), c ≤ u ≤ d ? If so, this would mean that our
definition is not well-defined. Luckily, it turns out that the value of a line integral of a
vector field is unchanged as long as the direction of the curve C is preserved by whatever
parametrization is chosen:
Theorem 4.2. Let f( x, y) = P ( x, y) i + Q ( x, y) j be a vector field, and let C be a smooth curve
parametrized by x = x( t), y = y( t), a ≤ t ≤ b. Suppose that t = α( u) for c ≤ u ≤ d , such that
a = α( c), b = α( d ), and α ′ ( u) > 0 on the open interval ( c, d ) (i.e. α( u) is strictly increasing on
R
[ c, d ]). Then C f · d r has the same value for the parametrizations x = x( t), y = y( t), a ≤ t ≤ b
and x = x̃( u) = x(α( u)), y = ỹ( u) = y(α( u)), c ≤ u ≤ d .
Proof: Since α( u) is strictly increasing and maps [ c, d ] onto [a, b], then we know that t =
α( u) has an inverse function u = α−1 ( t) defined on [a, b] such that c = α−1 (a), d = α−1 ( b),
1
′
and du
dt = α ′ ( u) . Also, dt = α ( u) du, and by the Chain Rule

x̃ ′ ( u) =

which shows that C P ( x, y) dx has the same value for both parametrizations. A similar

argument shows that C Q ( x, y) d y has the same value for both parametrizations, and hence
R
QED
C f · d r has the same value.

Notice that the condition α ′ ( u) > 0 in Theorem 4.2 means that the two parametrizations
move along C in the same direction. That was not the case with the “reverse” parametrization for −C : for u = a + b − t we have t = α( u) = a + b − u ⇒ α ′ ( u) = −1 < 0.

Theorem 4.2 we know that if C is parametrized by

x = sin u ,

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

So far, the examples we have seen of line integrals (e.g. Example 4.2) have had the same
value for different curves joining the initial point to the terminal point. That is, the line
integral has been independent of the path joining the two points. As we mentioned before,
this is not always the case. The following theorem gives a necessary and sufficient condition
for this path independence:
R
Theorem 4.3. In a region R , the line integral C f · d r is independent of the path between
H
any two points in R if and only if C f · d r = 0 for every closed curve C which is contained in
R.
H
Proof: Suppose that C f · d r = 0 for every closed curve C which is contained in R . Let P1
and P2 be two distinct points in R . Let C 1 be a curve in R going from P1 to P2 , and let C 2
be another curve in R going from P1 to P2 , as in Figure 4.2.2.

Then C = C 1 ∪ −C 2 is a closed curve in R (from P1 to
H
P1 ), and so C f · d r = 0. Thus,

4.2 Properties of Line Integrals

147

Clearly, the above theorem does not give a practical way to determine path independence,
since it is impossible to check the line integrals around all possible closed curves in a region.
What it mostly does is give an idea of the way in which line integrals behave, and how seemingly unrelated line integrals can be related (in this case, a specific line integral between
two points and all line integrals around closed curves).
For a more practical method for determining path independence, we first need a version
of the Chain Rule for multivariable functions:
Theorem 4.4. (Chain Rule) If z = f ( x, y) is a continuously differentiable function of x and
y, and both x = x( t) and y = y( t) are differentiable functions of t, then z is a differentiable
function of t, and
dz
∂ z dx
∂z d y
=
+
(4.19)
dt
∂ x dt
∂ y dt
at all points where the derivatives on the right are defined.
The proof is virtually identical to the proof of Theorem 2.2 from Section 2.4 (which uses the
Mean Value Theorem), so we omit it.1 We will now use this Chain Rule to prove the following
sufficient condition for path independence of line integrals:
Theorem 4.5. Let f( x, y) = P ( x, y) i + Q ( x, y) j be a vector field in some region R , with P and
Q continuously differentiable functions on R . Let C be a smooth curve in R parametrized
by x = x( t), y = y( t), a ≤ t ≤ b. Suppose that there is a real-valued function F ( x, y) such that
∇F = f on R . Then
Z
f · d r = F (B ) − F ( A ) ,
(4.20)
C

where A = ( x(a), y(a)) and B = ( x( b), y( b)) are the endpoints of C . Thus, the line integral is
independent of the path between its endpoints, since it depends only on the values of F at
those endpoints.

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

Theorem 4.5 can be thought of as the line integral version of the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus. A real-valued function F ( x, y) such that ∇F ( x, y) = f( x, y) is called a potential
for f. A conservative vector field is one which has a potential.
R
Example 4.5. Recall from Examples 4.2 and 4.3 in Section 4.1 that the line integral C ( x2 +
y2 ) dx + 2 x y d y was found to have the value 13
3 for three different curves C going from the
point (0, 0) to the point (1, 2). Use Theorem 4.5 to show that this line integral is indeed path
independent.

Solution: We need to find a real-valued function F ( x, y) such that
∂F
∂x

= x 2 + y2

and

∂F
∂y

= 2x y .

Suppose that ∂∂Fx = x2 + y2 , Then we must have F ( x, y) = 13 x3 + x y2 + g( y) for some function
g( y). So ∂∂Fy = 2 x y + g ′ ( y) satisfies the condition ∂∂Fy = 2 x y if g ′ ( y) = 0, i.e. g( y) = K , where K
is a constant. Since any choice for K will do (why?), we pick K = 0. Thus, a potential F ( x, y)
for f( x, y) = ( x2 + y2 ) i + 2 x y j exists, namely

F ( x, y) =

1 3
x + x y2 .
3

R
Hence the line integral C ( x2 + y2 ) dx + 2 x y d y is path independent.
Note that we can also verify that the value of the line integral of f along any curve C going
from (0, 0) to (1, 2) will always be 13
3 , since by Theorem 4.5

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

4.3 Green’s Theorem
We will now see a way of evaluating the line integral of a smooth vector field around a
simple closed curve. A vector field f( x, y) = P ( x, y) i + Q ( x, y) j is smooth if its component
functions P ( x, y) and Q ( x, y) are smooth. We will use Green’s Theorem (sometimes called
Green’s Theorem in the plane) to relate the line integral around a closed curve with a double
integral over the region inside the curve:
Theorem 4.7. (Green’s Theorem) Let R be a region in R2 whose boundary is a simple
closed curve C which is piecewise smooth. Let f( x, y) = P ( x, y) i + Q ( x, y) j be a smooth vector
field defined on both R and C . Then

C 1 = the curve y = y1 ( x) from the point X 1 to the point X 2

This would seem to contradict Green’s Theorem. However, note that R is not the entire
region enclosed by C , since the point (0, 0) is not contained in R . That is, R has a “hole” at
the origin, so Green’s Theorem does not apply.

If we modify the region R to be the annulus R =

the “boundary” C of R to be C = C 1 ∪ C 2 , where C 1 is
the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 traversed counterclockwise
and C 2 is the circle x2 + y2 = 1/4 traversed clockwise,

It turns out that Green’s Theorem can be extended to multiply connected regions, that is,
regions like the annulus in Example 4.8, which have one or more regions cut out from the
interior, as opposed to discrete points being cut out. For such regions, the “outer” boundary
and the “inner” boundaries are traversed so that R is always on the left side.

Multiply connected regions

The intuitive idea for why Green’s Theorem holds for multiply connected regions is shown
in Figure 4.3.4 above. The idea is to cut “slits” between the boundaries of a multiply connected region R so that R is divided into subregions which do not have any “holes”. For
example, in Figure 4.3.4(a) the region R is the union of the regions R 1 and R 2 , which are
divided by the slits indicated by the dashed lines. Those slits are part of the boundary of
both R 1 and R 2 , and we traverse then in the manner indicated by the arrows. Notice that
along each slit the boundary of R 1 is traversed in the opposite direction as that of R 2 , which

154

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

means that the line integrals of f along those slits cancel each other out. Since R 1 and R 2 do
not have holes in them, then Green’s Theorem holds in each subregion, so that

the theorem holds in the region with two holes shown in Figure 4.3.4(b).

a region R (whose boundary is a piecewise smooth, simple closed curve C ) has a potential in

R , then C f · d r = 0. And if the potential F ( x, y) is smooth in R , then ∂∂Fx = P and ∂∂Fy = Q , and

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

4.4 Surface Integrals and the Divergence Theorem
In Section 4.1 we learned how to integrate along a curve. We will now learn how to perform
integration over a surface in R3 , such as a sphere or a paraboloid. Recall from Section 1.8
how we identified points ( x, y, z) on a curve C in R3 , parametrized by x = x( t), y = y( t), z = z( t),
a ≤ t ≤ b, with the terminal points of the position vector
r( t) = x( t)i + y( t)j + z( t)k for t in [a, b].
The idea behind a parametrization of a curve is that it “transforms” a subset of R1 (normally an interval [a, b]) into a curve in R2 or R3 (see Figure 4.4.1).

Parametrization of a curve C in R3

Similar to how we used a parametrization of a curve to define the line integral along the
curve, we will use a parametrization of a surface to define a surface integral. We will use
two variables, u and v, to parametrize a surface Σ in R3 : x = x( u, v), y = y( u, v), z = z( u, v),
for ( u, v) in some region R in R2 (see Figure 4.4.2).

function

The parametrization of Σ can be thought of as “transforming” a region in R2 (in the uvplane) into a 2-dimensional surface in R3 . This parametrization of the surface is sometimes
called a patch, based on the idea of “patching” the region R onto Σ in the grid-like manner
shown in Figure 4.4.2.
In fact, those gridlines in R lead us to how we will define a surface integral over Σ. Along
the vertical gridlines in R , the variable u is constant. So those lines get mapped to curves on
Σ, and the variable u is constant along the position vector r( u, v). Thus, the tangent vector
to those curves at a point ( u, v) is ∂∂rv . Similarly, the horizontal gridlines in R get mapped to
curves on Σ whose tangent vectors are ∂∂ur .
Now take a point ( u, v) in R as, say, the lower left corner of one of the rectangular grid
sections in R , as shown in Figure 4.4.2. Suppose that this rectangle has a small width
and height of ∆ u and ∆v, respectively. The corner points of that rectangle are ( u, v), ( u +
∆ u, v), ( u + ∆ u, v + ∆v) and ( u, v + ∆v). So the area of that rectangle is A = ∆ u ∆v. Then that
rectangle gets mapped by the parametrization onto some section of the surface Σ which,
for ∆ u and ∆v small enough, will have a surface area (call it d σ) that is very close to the
area of the parallelogram which has adjacent sides r( u + ∆ u, v) − r( u, v) (corresponding to the
line segment from ( u, v) to ( u + ∆ u, v) in R ) and r( u, v + ∆v) − r( u, v) (corresponding to the
line segment from ( u, v) to ( u, v + ∆v) in R ). But by combining our usual notion of a partial
derivative (see Definition 2.3 in Section 2.2) with that of the derivative of a vector-valued
function (see Definition 1.12 in Section 1.8) applied to a function of two variables, we have
r( u + ∆ u, v) − r( u, v)
, and

This is a special case of a surface integral over the surface Σ, where the surface area element
d σ can be thought of as 1 d σ. Replacing 1 by a general real-valued function f ( x, y, z) defined
in R3 , we have the following:
Definition 4.3. Let Σ be a surface in R3 parametrized by x = x( u, v), y = y( u, v),
z = z( u, v), for ( u, v) in some region R in R2 . Let r( u, v) = x( u, v)i + y( u, v)j + z( u, v)k be the
position vector for any point on Σ, and let f ( x, y, z) be a real-valued function defined on some
subset of R3 that contains Σ. The surface integral of f ( x, y, z) over Σ is

as the circle revolves around the z-axis, the line segment from the origin to the center of that

4.4 Surface Integrals and the Divergence Theorem

circle sweeps out an angle v with the positive x-axis (see Figure 4.4.3(b)). Thus, the torus
can be parametrized as:

x = ( b + a cos u) cos v ,

y = ( b + a cos u) sin v ,

z = a sin u ,

0 ≤ u ≤ 2π ,

0 ≤ v ≤ 2π

So for the position vector
r( u, v) = x( u, v)i + y( u, v)j + z( u, v)k

= ( b + a cos u) cos v i + ( b + a cos u) sin v j + a sin u k

we see that
∂r

∂r
∂v

= −a sin u cos v i − a sin u sin v j + a cos u k
= −( b + a cos u) sin v i + ( b + a cos u) cos v j + 0k ,

and so computing the cross product gives

= −a( b + a cos u) cos v cos u i − a( b + a cos u) sin v cos u j − a( b + a cos u) sin u k ,

Since ∂∂ur and ∂∂rv are tangent to the surface Σ (i.e. lie in the tangent plane to Σ at each point

Recall that normal vectors to a plane can point in two opposite
directions. By an outward unit normal vector to a surface Σ,
we will mean the unit vector that is normal to Σ and points away
from the “top” (or “outer” part) of the surface. This is a hazy
definition, but the picture in Figure 4.4.4 gives a better idea of
what outward normal vectors look like, in the case of a sphere.
With this idea in mind, we make the following definition of a
surface integral of a 3-dimensional vector field over a surface:

Definition 4.4. Let Σ be a surface in R3 and let f( x, y, z) = f 1 ( x, y, z)i + f 2 ( x, y, z)j + f 3 ( x, y, z)k
be a vector field defined on some subset of R3 that contains Σ. The surface integral of f
over Σ is

where, at any point on Σ, n is the outward unit normal vector to Σ.

Note in the above definition that the dot product inside the integral on the right is a
real-valued function, and hence we can use Definition 4.3 to evaluate the integral.

Example 4.10. Evaluate the surface integral

is the part of the plane x + y + z = 1 with x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, and z ≥ 0, with the outward unit normal
n pointing in the positive z direction (see Figure 4.4.5).
Solution: Since the vector v = (1, 1, 1) is normal to the plane x + y + z = 1
(why?), then
³ dividing´ v by its length yields the outward unit normal
vector n = p1 , p1 , p1 . We now need to parametrize Σ. As we can see

from Figure 4.4.5, projecting Σ onto the x y-plane yields a triangular
region R = { ( x, y) : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 − x }. Thus, using ( u, v) instead of

Computing surface integrals can often be tedious, especially when the formula for the
outward unit normal vector at each point of Σ changes. The following theorem provides an
easier way in the case when Σ is a closed surface, that is, when Σ encloses a bounded
solid in R3 . For example, spheres, cubes, and ellipsoids are closed surfaces, but planes and
paraboloids are not.

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

Theorem 4.8. (Divergence Theorem) Let Σ be a closed surface in R3 which bounds a
solid S , and let f( x, y, z) = f 1 ( x, y, z)i + f 2 ( x, y, z)j + f 3 ( x, y, z)k be a vector field defined on some

is called the divergence of f.
The proof of the Divergence Theorem is very similar to the proof of Green’s Theorem, i.e. it
is first proved for the simple case when the solid S is bounded above by one surface, bounded
below by another surface, and bounded laterally by one or more surfaces. The proof can then
be extended to more general solids.3

f · d σ is often referred to as the flux of f

through the surface Σ. For example, if f represents the velocity field of a fluid, then the flux
is the net quantity of fluid to flow through the surface Σ per unit time. A positive flux means
there is a net flow out of the surface (i.e. in the direction of the outward unit normal vector
n), while a negative flux indicates a net flow inward (in the direction of −n).
The term divergence comes from interpreting div f as a measure of how much a vector
field “diverges” from a point. This is best seen by using another definition of div f which is
equivalent4 to the definition given by formula (4.32). Namely, for a point ( x, y, z) in R3 ,

div f( x, y, z) = lim

where V is the volume enclosed by a closed surface Σ around the point ( x, y, z). In the
limit, V → 0 means that we take smaller and smaller closed surfaces around ( x, y, z), which
means that the volumes they enclose are going to zero. It can be shown that this limit is
independent of the shapes of those surfaces. Notice that the limit being taken is of the
ratio of the flux through a surface to the volume enclosed by that surface, which gives a
rough measure of the flow “leaving” a point, as we mentioned. Vector fields which have zero
divergence are often called solenoidal fields.
The following theorem is a simple consequence of formula (4.33).
Theorem 4.9. If the flux of a vector field f is zero through every closed surface containing a
given point, then div f = 0 at that point.
Proof: By formula (4.33), at the given point ( x, y, z) we have

So far the only types of line integrals which we have discussed are those along curves in R2 .
But the definitions and properties which were covered in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 can easily be
extended to include functions of three variables, so that we can now discuss line integrals
along curves in R3 .

Similar to the two-variable case, if f ( x, y, z) ≥ 0 then the line integral C f ( x, y, z) ds can be
thought of as the total area of the “picket fence” of height f ( x, y, z) at each point along the
curve C in R3 .
Vector fields in R3 are defined in a similar fashion to those in R2 , which allows us to define
the line integral of a vector field along a curve in R3 .

R
point ( x, y, z) then the line integral C f · d r represents the work done by that force in moving
the object along the curve C in R3 .
Some of the most important results we will need for line integrals in R3 are stated below
without proof (the proofs are similar to their two-variable equivalents).

We will now discuss a generalization of Green’s Theorem in R2 to orientable surfaces in
R , called Stokes’ Theorem. A surface Σ in R3 is orientable if there is a continuous vector
field N in R3 such that N is nonzero and normal to Σ (i.e. perpendicular to the tangent plane)
at each point of Σ. We say that such an N is a normal vector field.
3

z
For example, the unit sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 is orientable, since the
N
continuous vector field N( x, y, z) = x i + y j + z k is nonzero and normal
to the sphere at each point. In fact, −N( x, y, z) is another normal
−N
vector field (see Figure 4.5.2). We see in this case that N( x, y, z) is
y
what we have called an outward normal vector, and −N( x, y, z) is an
0
inward normal vector. These “outward” and “inward” normal vector fields on the sphere correspond to an “outer” and “inner” side,
x
respectively, of the sphere. That is, we say that the sphere is a twoFigure 4.5.2
sided surface. Roughly, “two-sided” means “orientable”. Other examples of two-sided, and hence orientable, surfaces are cylinders,
paraboloids, ellipsoids, and planes.
You may be wondering what kind of surface would not have two sides. An example is the
Möbius strip, which is constructed by taking a thin rectangle and connecting its ends at
the opposite corners, resulting in a “twisted” strip (see Figure 4.5.3).

Figure 4.5.3 Möbius strip

If you imagine walking along a line down the center of the Möbius strip, as in Figure
4.5.3(b), then you arrive back at the same place from which you started but upside down!
That is, your orientation changed even though your motion was continuous along that center

4.5 Stokes’ Theorem

169

line. Informally, thinking of your vertical direction as a normal vector field along the strip,
there is a discontinuity at your starting point (and, in fact, at every point) since your vertical
direction takes two different values there. The Möbius strip has only one side, and hence is
nonorientable.7
For an orientable surface Σ which has a boundary curve C , pick a unit normal vector n
such that if you walked along C with your head pointing in the direction of n, then the
surface would be on your left. We say in this situation that n is a positive unit normal vector
and that C is traversed n-positively. We can now state Stokes’ Theorem:
Theorem 4.14. (Stokes’ Theorem) Let Σ be an orientable surface in R3 whose boundary
is a simple closed curve C , and let f( x, y, z) = P ( x, y, z)i + Q ( x, y, z)j + R ( x, y, z)k be a smooth
vector field defined on some subset of R3 that contains Σ. Then

n is a positive unit normal vector over Σ, and C is traversed n-positively.
Proof: As the general case is beyond the scope of this text, we will prove the theorem only
for the special case where Σ is the graph of z = z( x, y) for some smooth real-valued function
z( x, y), with ( x, y) varying over a region D in R2 .
z

Projecting Σ onto the x y-plane, we see that the closed
curve C (the boundary curve of Σ) projects onto a closed
curve C D which is the boundary curve of D (see Figure 4.5.4). Assuming that C has a smooth parametrization, its projection C D in the x y-plane also has a smooth
parametrization, say

Σ : z = z(x, y)

C : x = x( t) , y = y( t) , z = z( x( t), y( t)) , a ≤ t ≤ b ,

since the curve C is part of the surface z = z( x, y). Now, by the Chain Rule (Theorem 4.4 in
Section 4.2), for z = z( x( t), y( t)) as a function of t, we know that

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

Note: The condition in Stokes’ Theorem that the surface Σ have a (continuously varying) positive unit normal vector n and a boundary curve C traversed n-positively can be
expressed more precisely as follows: if r( t) is the position vector for C and T( t) = r ′ ( t)/k r ′ ( t) k
is the unit tangent vector to C , then the vectors T, n, T × n form a right-handed system.
Also, it should be noted that Stokes’ Theorem holds even when the boundary curve C is
piecewise smooth.
Example 4.14. Verify Stokes’ Theorem for f( x, y, z) = z i + x j + y k when Σ is the paraboloid
z = x2 + y2 such that z ≤ 1 (see Figure 4.5.5).

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

H
In physical applications, for a simple closed curve C the line integral C f · d r is often called
the circulation of f around C . For example, if E represents the electrostatic field due to a
H
point charge, then it turns out8 that curl E = 0, which means that the circulation C E · d r = 0
by Stokes’ Theorem. Vector fields which have zero curl are often called irrotational fields.
In fact, the term curl was created by the 19th century Scottish physicist James Clerk
Maxwell in his study of electromagnetism, where it is used extensively. In physics, the
curl is interpreted as a measure of circulation density. This is best seen by using another
definition of curl f which is equivalent9 to the definition given by formula (4.46). Namely, for
a point ( x, y, z) in R3 ,
I
1
f · dr ,
(4.50)
n · (curl f )( x, y, z) = lim
S →0 S C

where S is the surface area of a surface Σ containing the point ( x, y, z) and with a simple
closed boundary curve C and positive unit normal vector n at ( x, y, z). In the limit, think of
the curve C shrinking to the point ( x, y, z), which causes Σ, the surface it bounds, to have
smaller and smaller surface area. That ratio of circulation to surface area in the limit is
what makes the curl a rough measure of circulation density (i.e. circulation per unit area).
y
An idea of how the curl of a vector field is
related to rotation is shown in Figure 4.5.6.
Suppose we have a vector field f( x, y, z) which
is always parallel to the x y-plane at each
f
point ( x, y, z) and that the vectors grow larger
the further the point ( x, y, z) is from the yaxis. For example, f( x, y, z) = (1 + x2 ) j. Think
of the vector field as representing the flow
of water, and imagine dropping two wheels
with paddles into that water flow, as in Figure 4.5.6. Since the flow is stronger (i.e. the
x
magnitude of f is larger) as you move away
0
from the y-axis, then such a wheel would rotate counterclockwise if it were dropped to
Figure 4.5.6 Curl and rotation
the right of the y-axis, and it would rotate
clockwise if it were dropped to the left of the y-axis. In both cases the curl would be nonzero
(curl f( x, y, z) = 2 x k in our example) and would obey the right-hand rule, that is, curl f( x, y, z)
points in the direction of your thumb as you cup your right hand in the direction of the rotation of the wheel. So the curl points outward (in the positive z-direction) if x > 0 and points
inward (in the negative z-direction) if x < 0. Notice that if all the vectors had the same direction and the same magnitude, then the wheels would not rotate and hence there would
be no curl (which is why such fields are called irrotational, meaning no rotation).

8 See Ch. 2 in R EITZ, M ILFORD and C HRISTY .
9 See S CHEY, p. 78-81, for the derivation.

connected (i.e. regions having no holes):
The following statements are equivalent for a simply connected solid region S in R3 :

4.6 Gradient, Divergence, Curl and Laplacian
In this final section we will establish some relationships between the gradient, divergence
and curl, and we will also introduce a new quantity called the Laplacian. We will then show
how to write these quantities in cylindrical and spherical coordinates.
For a real-valued function f ( x, y, z) on R3 , the gradient ∇ f ( x, y, z) is a vector-valued function on R3 , that is, its value at a point ( x, y, z) is the vector
∇ f ( x, y, z) =

in R3 , where each of the partial derivatives is evaluated at the point ( x, y, z). So in this way,
you can think of the symbol ∇ as being “applied” to a real-valued function f to produce a
vector ∇ f .
It turns out that the divergence and curl can also be expressed in terms of the symbol ∇.
This is done by thinking of ∇ as a vector in R3 , namely
∇ =

∂

(4.51)

Here, the symbols ∂∂x , ∂∂y and ∂∂z are to be thought of as “partial derivative operators” that
will get “applied” to a real-valued function, say f ( x, y, z), to produce the partial derivatives
∂f ∂f
∂f
∂f
,
and ∂ z . For instance, ∂∂x “applied” to f ( x, y, z) produces ∂ x .
∂x ∂ y
Is ∇ really a vector? Strictly speaking, no, since ∂∂x , ∂∂y and ∂∂z are not actual numbers. But
it helps to think of ∇ as a vector, especially with the divergence and curl, as we will soon see.
The process of “applying” ∂∂x , ∂∂y , ∂∂z to a real-valued function f ( x, y, z) is normally thought of
as multiplying the quantities:

For this reason, ∇ is often referred to as the “del operator”, since it “operates” on functions.
For example, it is often convenient to write the divergence div f as ∇ · f, since for a vector
field f( x, y, z) = f 1 ( x, y, z)i + f 2 ( x, y, z)j + f 3 ( x, y, z)k, the dot product of f with ∇ (thought of as a
vector) makes sense:

Note that we could have calculated ∆k r k2 another way, using the ∇ notation along with parts
(a) and (b):
∆k r k2 = ∇ · ∇k r k2 = ∇ · 2 r = 2 ∇ · r = 2(3) = 6
Notice that in Example 4.17 if we take the curl of the gradient of k r k2 we get
∇ × (∇k r k2 ) = ∇ × 2 r = 2 ∇ × r = 2 0 = 0 .

The following theorem shows that this will be the case in general:

Corollary 4.16. If a vector field f( x, y, z) has a potential, then curl f = 0.
Another way of stating Theorem 4.15 is that gradients are irrotational. Also, notice that
in Example 4.17 if we take the divergence of the curl of r we trivially get
∇ · (∇ × r) = ∇ · 0 = 0 .

The following theorem shows that this will be the case in general:
Theorem 4.17. For any smooth vector field f( x, y, z), ∇ · (∇ × f) = 0.
The proof is straightforward and left as an exercise for the reader.

Corollary 4.18. The flux of the curl of a smooth vector field f( x, y, z) through any closed
surface is zero.

region (usually all of R3 ), then we must have f ( x, y, z) = 0 throughout that region. The proof
is not trivial, and physicists do not usually bother to prove it. But the result is true, and can
also be applied to double and triple integrals.
For instance, to prove Theorem 4.15, assume that f ( x, y, z) is a smooth real-valued function on R3 . Let C be a simple closed curve in R3 and let Σ be any capping surface for C (i.e.
Σ is orientable and its boundary is C ). Since ∇ f is a vector field, then

Since the choice of Σ was arbitrary, then we must have (∇×
n is any unit vector. Using i, j and k in place of n, we see that we must have ∇ × (∇ f ) = 0 in
R3 , which completes the proof.

Example 4.18. A system of electric charges has a charge density ρ ( x, y, z) and produces an
electrostatic field E( x, y, z) at points ( x, y, z) in space. Gauss’ Law states that

∇ · E = 4πρ .

Often (especially in physics) it is convenient to use other coordinate systems when dealing
with quantities such as the gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian. We will present the
formulas for these in cylindrical and spherical coordinates.
Recall from Section 1.7 that a point ( x, y, z) can be represented in cylindrical coordinates
( r, θ , z), where x = r cos θ , y = r sin θ , z = z. At each point ( r, θ , z), let er , eθ , e z be unit vectors
in the direction of increasing r , θ , z, respectively (see Figure 4.6.1). Then er , eθ , e z form an
orthonormal set of vectors. Note, by the right-hand rule, that e z × er = eθ .

Similarly, a point ( x, y, z) can be represented in spherical coordinates (ρ , θ , φ), where x =
ρ sin φ cos θ , y = ρ sin φ sin θ , z = ρ cos φ. At each point (ρ , θ , φ), let eρ , eθ , eφ be unit vectors
in the direction of increasing ρ , θ , φ, respectively (see Figure 4.6.2). Then the vectors eρ , eθ ,
eφ are orthonormal. By the right-hand rule, we see that eθ × eρ = eφ .
We can now summarize the expressions for the gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian
in Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates in the following tables:

The derivation of the above formulas for cylindrical and spherical coordinates is straightforward but extremely tedious. The basic idea is to take the Cartesian equivalent of the
quantity in question and to substitute into that formula using the appropriate coordinate
transformation. As an example, we will derive the formula for the gradient in spherical
coordinates.

4.6 Gradient, Divergence, Curl and Laplacian

183

Goal: Show that the gradient of a real-valued function F (ρ , θ , φ) in spherical coordinates is:
∇F =

∂F
∂ρ

eρ +

∂F
1
1 ∂F
eθ +
eφ
ρ sin φ ∂θ
ρ ∂φ

Idea: In the Cartesian gradient formula ∇F ( x, y, z) = ∂∂Fx i + ∂∂Fy j + ∂∂Fz k, put the Cartesian basis vectors i, j, k in terms of the spherical coordinate basis vectors eρ , eθ , eφ and functions of
F
and functions
ρ , θ and φ. Then put the partial derivatives ∂∂Fx , ∂∂Fy , ∂∂Fz in terms of ∂∂ρF , ∂∂θF , ∂∂φ
of ρ , θ and φ.
Step 1: Get formulas for eρ , eθ , eφ in terms of i, j, k.
We can see from Figure 4.6.2 that the unit vector eρ in the ρ direction at a general point
(ρ , θ , φ) is eρ = k rr k , where r = x i + y j + z k is the position vector of the point in Cartesian
coordinates. Thus,
r
xi+ yj+ zk
eρ =
= p
,
krk
x 2 + y2 + z 2
p
so using x = ρ sin φ cos θ , y = ρ sin φ sin θ , z = ρ cos φ, and ρ = x2 + y2 + z2 , we get:
eρ = sin φ cos θ i + sin φ sin θ j + cos φ k

Now, since the angle θ is measured in the x y-plane, then the unit vector eθ in the θ
direction must be parallel to the x y-plane. That is, eθ is of the form a i + b j + 0 k. To figure
out what a and b are, note that since eθ ⊥ eρ , then in particular eθ ⊥ eρ when eρ is in the
x y-plane. That occurs when the angle φ is π/2. Putting φ = π/2 into the formula for eρ gives
eρ = cos θ i + sin θ j + 0 k, and we see that a vector perpendicular to that is − sin θ i + cos θ j + 0 k.
Since this vector is also a unit vector and points in the (positive) θ direction, it must be eθ :
eθ = − sin θ i + cos θ j + 0 k
Lastly, since eφ = eθ × eρ , we get:
eφ = cos φ cos θ i + cos φ sin θ j − sin φ k
Step 2: Use the three formulas from Step 1 to solve for i, j, k in terms of eρ , eθ , eφ .
This comes down to solving a system of three equations in three unknowns. There are
many ways of doing this, but we will do it by combining the formulas for eρ and eφ to
eliminate k, which will give us an equation involving just i and j. This, with the formula for
eθ , will then leave us with a system of two equations in two unknowns (i and j), which we
will use to solve first for j then for i. Lastly, we will solve for k.
First, note that
sin φ eρ + cos φ eφ = cos θ i + sin θ j

184

CHAPTER 4. LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS

so that
sin θ (sin φ eρ + cos φ eφ ) + cos θ eθ = (sin2 θ + cos2 θ )j = j ,
and so:
j = sin φ sin θ eρ + cos θ eθ + cos φ sin θ eφ
Likewise, we see that
cos θ (sin φ eρ + cos φ eφ ) − sin θ eθ = (cos2 θ + sin2 θ )i = i ,
and so:
i = sin φ cos θ eρ − sin θ eθ + cos φ cos θ eφ
Lastly, we see that:
k = cos φ eρ − sin φ eφ
Step 3: Get formulas for ∂∂ρF , ∂∂θF ,
By the Chain Rule, we have

Appendix B
We will prove the right-hand rule for the cross product of two vectors in R3 .
For any vectors v and w in R3 , define a new vector, n(v, w), as follows:
1. If v and w are nonzero and not parallel, and θ is the angle between them, then n(v, w) is
the vector in R3 such that:
(a) the magnitude of n(v, w) is k v k k w k sin θ ,
(b) n(v, w) is perpendicular to the plane containing v and w, and
(c) v, w, n(v, w) form a right-handed system.
2. If v and w are nonzero and parallel, then n(v, w) = 0.
3. If either v or w is 0, then n(v, w) = 0.
The goal is to show that n(v, w) = v × w for all v, w in R3 , which would prove the right-hand
rule for the cross product (by part 1(c) of our definition). To do this, we will perform the
following steps:
Step 1: Show that n(v, w) = v × w if v and w are any two of the basis vectors i, j, k.
This was already shown in Example 1.11 in Section 1.4. X

Step 2: Show that n(av, bw) = ab(v × w) for any scalars a, b if v and w are any two of the
basis vectors i, j, k.
If either a = 0 or b = 0 then n(av, bw) = 0 = ab(v × w), so the result holds. So assume that
a 6= 0 and b 6= 0. Let v and w be any two of the basis vectors i, j, k. For example, we will show
that the result holds for v = i and w = k (the other possibilities follow in a similar fashion).
For av = ai and bw = bk, the angle θ between av and bw is 90◦ . Hence the magnitude
of n(av, bw), by definition, is k ai k k bk k sin 90◦ = | ab |. Also, by definition, n(av, bw) is perpendicular to the plane containing ai and bk, namely, the xz-plane. Thus, n(av, bw) must
be a scalar multiple of j. Since its magnitude is | ab |, then n(av, bw) must be either | ab |j or
−| ab |j.
There are four possibilities for the combinations of signs for a and b. We will consider the
case when a > 0 and b > 0 (the other three possibilities are handled similarly).

192

193
In this case, n(av, bw) must be either abj or −abj. Now, since i, j, k form a right-handed
system, then i, k, j form a left-handed system, and so i, k, −j form a right-handed system.
Thus, ai, bk, −abj form a right-handed system (since a > 0, b > 0, and ab > 0). So since, by
definition, ai, bk, n(ai, bk) form a right-handed system, and since n(ai, bk) has to be either
abj or −abj, this means that we must have n(ai, bk) = −abj.
But we know that ai × bk = ab(i × k) = ab(−j) = −abj. Therefore, n(ai, bk) = ab(i × k),
which is what we needed to show.
∴ n(av, bw) = ab(v × w) X
Step 3: Show that n(u, v + w) = n(u, v) + n(u, w) for any vectors u, v, w.

If u = 0 then the result holds trivially since n(u, v + w), n(u, v) and n(u, w) are all the zero
vector. If v = 0, then the result follows easily since n(u, v + w) = n(u, 0 + w) = n(u, w) =
0 + n(u, w) = n(u, 0) = n(u, w) = n(u, v) + n(u, w). A similar argument shows that the result
holds if w = 0.
So now assume that u, v and w are all nonzero vectors. We will describe a geometric
construction of n(u, v), which is shown in the figure below. Let P be a plane perpendicular
to u. Multiply the vector v by the positive scalar k u k, then project the vector k u k v straight
down onto the plane P . You can think of this projection vector (denoted by pro j P k u k v) as
the shadow of the vector k u k v on the plane P , with the light source directly overhead the
terminal point of k u k v. If θ is the angle between u and v, then we see that pro j P k u k v has
magnitude k u k k v k sin θ , which is the magnitude of n(u, v). So rotating pro j P k u k v by 90◦
in a counter-clockwise direction in the plane P gives a vector whose magnitude is the same
as that of n(u, v) and which is perpendicular to pro j P k u k v (and hence perpendicular to v).
Since this vector is in P then it is also perpendicular to u. And we can see that u, v and
this vector form a right-handed system. Hence this vector must be n(u, v). Note that this
holds even if u ∥ v, since in that case θ = 0◦ and so sin θ = 0 which means that n(u, v) has
magnitude 0, which is what we would expect.

Now apply this same geometric construction to get n(u, w) and n(u, v + w). Since k u k (v +
w) is the sum of the vectors k u k v and k u k w, then the projection vector pro j P k u k (v + w) is
the sum of the projection vectors pro j P k u k v and pro j P k u k w (to see this, using the shadow

194

Appendix B:

Proof of the Right-Hand Rule for the Cross Product

analogy again and the parallelogram rule for vector addition, think of how projecting a
parallelogram onto a plane gives you a parallelogram in that plane). So then rotating all
three projection vectors by 90◦ in a counter-clockwise direction in the plane P preserves that
sum (see the figure below), which means that n(u, v + w) = n(u, v) + n(u, w). X

Step 4: Show that n(w, v) = −n(v, w) for any vectors v, w.

If v and w are nonzero and parallel, or if either is 0, then n(w, v) = 0 = −n(v, w), so the result
holds. So assume that v and w are nonzero and not parallel. Then n(w, v) has magnitude
k w k k v k sin θ , which is the same as the magnitude of n(v, w), and hence is the same as the
magnitude of −n(v, w). By definition, n(v, w) is perpendicular to the plane containing w and
v, and hence so is −n(v, w). Also, v, w, n(v, w) form a right-handed system, and so w, v,
n(v, w) form a left-handed system, and hence w, v, −n(v, w) form a right-handed system.
Thus, we have shown that −n(v, w) is a vector with the same magnitude as n(w, v) and is
perpendicular to the plane containing w and v, and that w, v, −n(v, w) form a right-handed
system. So by definition this means that −n(v, w) must be n(w, v). X
Step 5: Show that n(v, w) = v × w for all vectors v, w.

Write v = v1 i + v2 j + v3 k and w = w1 i + w2 j + w3 k. Then by Steps 3 and 4, we have

195

n(v, w) = n(v1 i + v2 j + v3 k, w1 i + w2 j + w3 k)

= n(v1 i + v2 j + v3 k, w1 i) + n(v1 i + v2 j + v3 k, w2 j + w3 k)

= n(v1 i + v2 j + v3 k, w1 i) + n(v1 i + v2 j + v3 k, w2 j) + n(v1 i + v2 j + v3 k, w3 k)

= −n(w1 i, v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) + −n(w2 j, v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) + −n(w3 k, v1 i + v2 j + v3 k).

We can use Steps 1 and 2 to evaluate the three terms on the right side of the last equation
above:
−n(w1 i, v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) = −n(w1 i, v1 i) + −n(w1 i, v2 j) + −n(w1 i, v3 k)
= −v1 w1 n(i, i) + −v2 w1 n(i, j) + −v3 w1 n(i, k)

= −v1 w1 (i × i) + −v2 w1 (i × j) + −v3 w1 (i × k)

= −v1 w1 0 + −v2 w1 k + −v3 w1 (−j)

−n(w1 i, v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) = −v2 w1 k + v3 w1 j

Similarly, we can calculate
−n(w2 j, v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) = v1 w2 k − v3 w2 i

and
−n(w3 j, v1 i + v2 j + v3 k) = −v1 w3 j + v2 w3 i .

Thus, putting it all together, we have
n(v, w) = −v2 w1 k + v3 w1 j + v1 w2 k − v3 w2 i − v1 w3 j + v2 w3 i
= (v2 w3 − v3 w2 )i + (v3 w1 − v1 w3 )j + (v1 w2 − v2 w1 )k
= v × w by definition of the cross product.

∴ n(v, w) = v × w for all vectors v, w. X

So since v, w, n(v, w) form a right-handed system, then v, w, v × w form a right-handed
system, which completes the proof.

Appendix C
3D Graphing with Gnuplot
Gnuplot is a free, open-source software package for producing a variety of graphs. Versions
are available for many operating systems. Below is a very brief tutorial on how to use
Gnuplot to graph functions of several variables.
INSTALLATION
1. Go to http://www.gnuplot.info/download.html and follow the links to download the latest version for your operating system. For Windows, you should get the Zip file with a
name such as gp420win32.zip, which is version 4.2.0. All the examples we will discuss
require at least version 4.2.0.
2. Install the downloaded file. For example, in Windows you would unzip the Zip file you
downloaded in Step 1 into some folder (use the “Use folder names” option if extracting
with WinZip).
RUNNING GNUPLOT
1. In Windows, run wgnuplot.exe from the folder (or bin folder) where you installed Gnuplot. In Linux, just type gnuplot in a terminal window.
2. You should now get a Gnuplot terminal with a gnuplot> command prompt. In Windows
this will appear in a new window, while in Linux it will appear in the terminal window
where the gnuplot command was run. For Windows, if the font is unreadable you can
change it by right-clicking on the text part of the Gnuplot window and selecting the
“Choose Font..” option. For example, the font “Courier”, style “Regular”, size “12” is
usually a good choice (that choice can be saved for future sessions by right-clicking in the
Gnuplot window again and selecting the option to update wgnuplot.ini).
3. At the gnuplot> command prompt you can now run graphing commands, which we will
now describe.
GRAPHING FUNCTIONS
The usual way to create 3D graphs in Gnuplot is with the splot command:
splot <range> <comma-separated list of functions>

196

197
For a function z = f ( x, y), <range> is the range of x and y values (and optionally the range
of z values) over which to plot. To specify an x range and a y range, use an expression of the
form [a : b][ c : d ], for some numbers a < b and c < d . This will cause the graph to be plotted
for a ≤ x ≤ b and c ≤ y ≤ d .
Function definitions use the x and y variables in combination with mathematical operators,
listed below:

Example C.1. To graph the function z = 2 x2 + y2 from x = −1 to x = 1 and from y = −2 to
y = 2, type this at the gnuplot> prompt:
splot [-1:1][-2:2] 2*x**2 + y**2

The result is shown below:

Appendix C:

3D Graphing with Gnuplot

Note that we had to type 2*x**2 to multiply 2 times x2 . For clarity, parentheses can be used
to make sure the operations are being performed in the correct order:
splot [-1:1][-2:2] 2*(x**2) + y**2

In the above example, to also plot the function z = e x+ y on the same graph, put a comma
after the first function then append the new function:
splot [-1:1][-2:2] 2*(x**2) + y**2, exp(x+y)

By default, the x-axis and y-axis are not shown in the graph. To display the axes, use this
command before the splot command:
set zeroaxis

Also, by default the x- and y-axes are switched from their usual position. To show the axes
with the orientation which we have used throughout the text, use this command:
set view 60,120,1,1

Also, to label the axes, use these commands:
set xlabel "x"
set ylabel "y"
set zlabel "z"

To show the level curves of the surface z = f ( x, y) on both the surface and projected onto the
x y-plane, use this command:
set contour both

The default mesh size for the grid on the surface is 10 units. To get more of a colored/shaded
surface, increase the mesh size (to, say, 25) like this:
set isosamples 25

Putting all this together, we get the following graph with these commands:
set zeroaxis
set view 60,120,1,1
set xlabel "x"
set ylabel "y"
set zlabel "z"
set contour both
set isosamples 25
splot [-1:1][-2:2] 2*(x**2) + y**2, exp(x+y)

The numbers listed below the functions in the key in the upper right corner of the graph
are the “levels” of the level curves of the corresponding surface. That is, they are the numbers c such that f ( x, y) = c. Because of the large number of level curves, the key was put
outside the graph with the set key outside command. If you do not want the function key
displayed, it can be turned off with this command: unset key
PARAMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Gnuplot has the ability to graph surfaces given in various parametric forms. For example,
for a surface parametrized in cylindrical coordinates

x = r cos θ ,

y = r sin θ ,

z=z

you would do the following:
set mapping cylindrical
set parametric
splot [a:b][c:d] v*cos(u),v*sin(u),f(u,v)

where the variable u represents θ , with a ≤ u ≤ b, the variable v represents r , with c ≤ v ≤ d ,
and z = f ( u, v) is some function of u and v.
Example C.2. The graph of the helicoid z = θ in Example 1.34 from Section 1.7 (p. 49) was
created using the following commands:

200

Appendix C:

3D Graphing with Gnuplot

set mapping cylindrical
set parametric
set view 60,120,1,1
set xyplane 0
set xlabel "x"
set ylabel "y"
set zlabel "z"
unset key
set isosamples 15
splot [0:4*pi][0:2] v*cos(u),v*sin(u),u

The command set xyplane 0 moves the z-axis so that z = 0 aligns with the x y-plane (which
is not the default in Gnuplot). Looking at the graph, you will see that r varies from 0 to 2,
and θ varies from 0 to 4π.
PRINTING AND SAVING
In Windows, to print a graph from Gnuplot right-click on the titlebar of the graph’s window,
select “Options” and then the “Print..” option. If that does not work on your version of
Gnuplot, then go to the File menu on the main Gnuplot menubar, select “Output Device ...”,
and enter pdf in the Terminal type? textfield, hit OK. That will allow you to print the graph
as a PDF file.
To save a graph, say, as a PNG file, go to the File menu on the main Gnuplot menubar,
select “Output Device ...”, and enter png in the Terminal type? textfield, hit OK. Then, in the
File menu again, select the “Output ...” option and enter a filename (say, graph.png) in the
Output filename? textfield, hit OK. Now run your splot command again and you should see
a file called graph.png in the current directory (usually the directory where wgnuplot.exe is
located, though you can change that setting using the “Change Directory ...” option in the
File menu).
In Linux, to save the graph as a file called graph.png, you would issue the following commands:
set terminal png
set output ’graph.png’

and then run your splot command. There are many terminal types (which determine the
output format). Run the command set terminal to see all the possible types. In Linux,
the postscript terminal type is popular, since the print quality is high and there are many
PostScript viewers available.
To quit Gnuplot, type quit at the gnuplot> command prompt.

51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy
and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document
must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,
which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free
software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the
same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction
or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License.
Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual
or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept
the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
copyright law.
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a
portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.

201

202

GNU Free Documentation License

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document
that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document
to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of
mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship
could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated,
as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released
under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.
If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts
or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most
25 words.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in
a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising
the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels)
generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for
any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup,
Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD,
and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages
as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body
of the text.
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either
is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
"Acknowledgments", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the

203
Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section
"Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that
this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be
included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to
obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly
display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of
the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover
Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both
covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.
You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the
covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can
be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the
first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,
or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option,
you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

204

GNU Free Documentation License

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before
redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of
sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition,
you must do these things in the Modified Version:
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document,
and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown
in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover
Texts given in the Document’s license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating
at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

205
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document
for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You
may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the
Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the
section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their
titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the
Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title
with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as
Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your
option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to
the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be
distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties–for example, statements of peer review
or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to
25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.
Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover
text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on
explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to
use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under
the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the

206

GNU Free Documentation License

combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you
preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections
with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that
section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles
in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgments", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all
sections Entitled "Endorsements".

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents
with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually
under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document,
and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent
documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document
is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate
which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document,
then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover
Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the
Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of

207
some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document,
and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version
of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgments", "Dedications", or "History",
the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing
the actual title.

9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://
www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document
specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the
document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

Copyright ©YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or
modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no
Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the
license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".

208

GNU Free Documentation License

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the
"with...Texts." line with this:

with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts
being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the
three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU
General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
