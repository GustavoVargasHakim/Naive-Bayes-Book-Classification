Introduction
The emphasis in this course is on problems—doing calculations and story problems. To master problem
solving one needs a tremendous amount of practice doing problems. The more problems you do the
better you will be at doing them, as patterns will start to emerge in both the problems and in successful
approaches to them. You will learn quickly and effectively if you devote some time to doing problems
every day.
Typically the most difficult problems are story problems, since they require some effort before you can
begin calculating. Here are some pointers for doing story problems:
1. Carefully read each problem twice before writing anything.
2. Assign letters to quantities that are described only in words; draw a diagram if appropriate.
3. Decide which letters are constants and which are variables. A letter stands for a constant if its value
remains the same throughout the problem.
4. Using mathematical notation, write down what you know and then write down what you want to
find.
5. Decide what category of problem it is (this might be obvious if the problem comes at the end of a
particular chapter, but will not necessarily be so obvious if it comes on an exam covering several
chapters).
6. Double check each step as you go along; don’t wait until the end to check your work.
7. Use common sense; if an answer is out of the range of practical possibilities, then check your work
to see where you went wrong.

1. Review
Success in calculus depends on your background in algebra, trigonometry, analytic geometry and functions. In this chapter, we review many of the concepts you will need to know to succeed in this course.

1.1 Algebra
1.1.1. Sets and Number Systems
A set can be thought of as any collection of distinct objects considered as a whole. Typically, sets are represented using set-builder notation and are surrounded by braces. Recall that (, ) are called parentheses
or round brackets; [, ] are called square brackets; and {, } are called braces or curly brackets.
Example 1.1: Sets

The collection {a, b, 1, 2} is a set. It consists of the collection of four distinct objects, namely, a, b,
1 and 2.
Let S be any set. We use the notation x ∈ S to mean that x is an element inside of the set S, and the
notation x 6∈ S to mean that x is not an element of the set S.
Example 1.2: Set Membership

If S = {a, b, c}, then a ∈ S but d 6∈ S.
The intersection between two sets S and T is denoted by S ∩ T and is the collection of all elements
that belong to both S and T . The union between two sets S and T is denoted by S ∪ T and is the collection
of all elements that belong to either S or T (or both).

Example 1.3: Union and Intersection

Let S = {a, b, c} and T = {b, d}. Then S ∩ T = {b} and S ∪ T = {a, b, c, d}. Note that we do not
write the element b twice in S ∪ T even though b is in both S and T .
Numbers can be classified into sets called number systems.

In the table, the set of rational numbers is written using set-builder notation. The colon, :, used in this
manner
means such o
that. Often times, a vertical bar | may also be used to mean such that. The expression
n
p
q : p, q ∈ Z, q 6= 0 can be read out loud as the set of all fractions p over q such that p and q are both
integers and q is not equal to zero.
Example 1.4: Rational Numbers

The numbers − 34 , 2.647, 17, 0.7̄ are all rational numbers. You can think of rational numbers as
fractions of one integer over another. Note that 2.647 can be written as a fraction:
2.647 = 2.647 ×

1000 2647

1000 1000

Also note that in the expression 0.7̄, the bar over the 7 indicates that the 7 is repeated forever:
7
0.77777777 . . . = .
9
All rational numbers are real numbers with the property that their decimal expansion either terminates
after a finite number of digits or begins to repeat the same finite sequence of digits over and over. Real
numbers that are not rational are called irrational.

Example 1.5: Irrational Numbers

Some of the most common irrational numbers include:
√
• 2. Can you prove this is irrational? (The proof uses a technique called contradiction.)
• π. Recall that π (pi) is defined as the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter
and can be approximated by 3.14159265.
• e. Sometimes called Euler’s number, e can be approximated by 2.718281828459. We will
review the definition of e in a later chapter.
Let S and T be two sets. If every element of S is also an element of T , then we say S is a subset of T
and write S ⊆ T . Furthermore, if S is a subset of T but not equal to T , we often write S ⊂ T . The five sets
of numbers in the table give an increasing sequence of sets:
N ⊂ Z ⊂ Q ⊂ R ⊂ C.

That is, all natural numbers are also integers, all integers are also rational numbers, all rational numbers
are also real numbers, and all real numbers are also complex numbers.

1.1.2. Law of Exponents
The Law of Exponents is a set of rules for simplifying expressions√that governs the combination of expo√
nents (powers). Recall that n denotes the nth root. For example 3 8 = 2 represents that the cube root of
8 is equal to 2.

1.1.3. The Quadratic Formula and Completing the Square
The technique of completing the square allows us to solve quadratic equations and also to determine the
center of a circle/ellipse or the vertex of a parabola.
The main idea behind completing the square is to turn:
ax2 + bx + c
into
a(x − h)2 + k.
One way to complete the square is to use the following formula:


b 2 b2
ax + bx + c = a x +
− 2 + c.
2a
4a
2

But this formula is a bit complicated, so some students prefer following the steps outlined in the next
example.

Example 1.8: Completing the Square

Solve 2x2 + 12x − 32 = 0 by completing the square.
Solution. In this instance, we will not divide by 2 first (usually you would) in order to demonstrate what
you should do when the ‘a’ value is not 1.

1.1. Algebra

7

2x2 + 12x − 32 = 0 Start with original equation.
2x2 + 12x = 32 Move the number over to the other side.
2(x2 + 6x) = 32 Factor out the a from the ax2 + bx expression.
6 →

6
2

= 3 → 32 = 9 Take the number in front of x,
divide by 2,
then square it.

2(x2 + 6x + 9) = 32 + 2 · 9 Add the result to both sides,
taking a = 2 into account.
2(x + 3)2 = 50 Factor the resulting perfect square trinomial.
You have now completed the square!
(x + 3)2 = 25 → x = 2 or x = −8

To solve for x, simply divide by a = 2
and take square roots.
♣

Suppose we want to solve for x in the quadratic equation ax2 +bx +c = 0, where a 6= 0. The solution(s)
to this equation are given by the quadratic formula.
The Quadratic Formula
The solutions to

ax2 + bx + c

√
−b ± b2 − 4ac
.

2a

Proof. To prove the quadratic formula we use the technique of completing the square. The general technique involves taking an expression of the form x2 + rx and trying to find a number we can add so that we
end up with a perfect square (that is, (x + n)2 ). It turns out if you add (r/2)2 then you can factor it as a
perfect square.
For example, suppose we want to solve for x in the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a 6= 0. Then we
can move c to the other side and divide by a (remember, a 6= 0 so we can divide by it) to get
c

x2 + x = − .

To write the left side as a perfect square we use what was mentioned previously. We have r = (b/a) in this

1.1.4. Inequalities, Intervals and Solving Basic Inequalities
Inequality Notation
Recall that we use the symbols <, >, ≤, ≥ when writing an inequality. In particular,
• a < b means a is to the left of b (that is, a is strictly less than b),
• a ≤ b means a is to the left of or the same as b (that is, a is less than or equal to b),
• a > b means a is to the right of b (that is, a is strictly greater than b),
• a ≥ b means a is to the right of or the same as b (that is, a is greater than or equal to b).
To keep track of the difference between the symbols, some students use the following mnemonic.
Mnemonic
The < symbol looks like a slanted L which stands for “Less than”.

Example 1.9: Inequalities

The following expressions are true:
1 < 2,

−5 < −2,

1 ≤ 2,

1 ≤ 1,

4 ≥ π > 3,

Intervals
Assume a, b are real numbers with a < b (i.e., a is strictly less than b). An interval is a set of every real
number between two indicated numbers and may or may not contain the two numbers themselves. When
describing intervals we use both round brackets and square brackets.
(1) Use of round brackets in intervals: ( , ). The notation (a,b) is what we call the open interval from
a to b and consists of all the numbers between a and b, but does not include a or b. Using set-builder
notation we write this as:
(a, b) = {x ∈ R : a < x < b}.
We read {x ∈ R : a < x < b} as “the set of real numbers x such that x is greater than a and less than b” On
the real number line we represent this with the following diagram:
a

b

Note that the circles on a and b are not shaded in, we call these open circles and use them to denote that
a, b are omitted from the set.
(2) Use of square brackets in intervals: [ , ]. The notation [a,b] is what we call the closed interval
from a to b and consists of all the numbers between a and b and including a and b. Using set-builder
notation we write this as
[a, b] = {x ∈ R | a ≤ x ≤ b}.
On the real number line we represent this with the following diagram:
a

b

Note that the circles on a and b are shaded in, we call these closed circles and use them to denote that a
and b are included in the set.
To keep track of when to shade a circle in, you may find the following mnemonic useful:
Mnemonic
The round brackets (, ) and non-shaded circle both form an “O” shape which stands for “Open and
Omit”.
Taking combinations of round and square brackets, we can write different possible types of intervals
(we assume a < b):
(a, b) = {x ∈ R : a < x < b} [a, b] = {x ∈ R : a ≤ x ≤ b}

Review
Note: Any set which is bound at positive and/or negative infinity is an open interval.

Inequality Rules
Before solving inequalities, we start with the properties and rules of inequalities.

Inequality Rules
Add/subtract a number to both sides:
• If a < b, then a + c < b + c and a − c < b − c.
Adding two inequalities of the same type:
• If a < b and c < d, then a + c < b + d.
Add the left sides together, add the right sides together.
Multiplying by a positive number:
• Let c > 0. If a < b, then c · a < c · b.
Multiplying by a negative number:
• Let c < 0. If a < b, then c · a > c · b.
Note that we reversed the inequality symbol!
Similar rules hold for each of ≤, > and ≥.

Solving Basic Inequalities
We can use the inequality rules to solve some simple inequalities.

Example 1.10: Basic Inequality

Find all values of x satisfying
3x + 1 > 2x − 3.

Write your answer in both interval and set-builder notation. Finally, draw a number line indicating
your solution set.
Solution. Subtracting 2x from both sides gives x + 1 > −3. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives x > −4.
Therefore, the solution is the interval (−4, ∞). In set-builder notation the solution may be written as
{x ∈ R : x > −4}. We illustrate the solution on the number line as follows:
‐4

♣

1.1. Algebra

11

Sometimes we need to split our inequality into two cases as the next example demonstrates.

Example 1.11: Double Inequalities

Solve the inequality
4 > 3x − 2 ≥ 2x − 1.
Solution. We need both 4 > 3x − 2 and 3x − 2 ≥ 2x − 1 to be true:
4 > 3x − 2
6 > 3x
2>x
x<2

and 3x − 2 ≥ 2x − 1,
and
x − 2 ≥ −1,
and
x ≥ 1,
and
x ≥ 1.

Thus, we require x ≥ 1 but also x < 2 to be true. This gives all the numbers between 1 and 2, including
1 but not including 2. That is, the solution to the inequality 4 > 3x − 2 ≥ 2x − 1 is the interval [1, 2). In
♣
set-builder notation this is the set {x ∈ R : 1 ≤ x < 2}.
Example 1.12: Positive Inequality

Solve 4x − x2 > 0.
Solution. We provide two methods to solve this inequality.
First method. Factor 4x − x2 as x(4 − x). The product of two numbers is positive when either both are
positive or both are negative, i.e., if either x > 0 and 4 − x > 0, or else x < 0 and 4 − x < 0. The latter
alternative is impossible, since if x is negative, then 4 − x is greater than 4, and so cannot be negative. As
for the first alternative, the condition 4 − x > 0 can be rewritten (adding x to both sides) as 4 > x, so we
need: x > 0 and 4 > x (this is sometimes combined in the form 4 > x > 0, or, equivalently, 0 < x < 4). In
interval notation, this says that the solution is the interval (0, 4).
Second method. Write 4x − x2 as −(x2 − 4x), and then complete the square, obtaining


− (x − 2)2 − 4 = 4 − (x − 2)2 .

For this to be positive we need (x − 2)2 < 4, which means that x − 2 must be less than 2 and greater than
−2: −2 < x − 2 < 2. Adding 2 to everything gives 0 < x < 4.
Both of these methods are equally correct; you may use either in a problem of this type.

♣

We next present another method to solve more complicated looking inequalities. In the next example
we will solve a rational inequality by using a number line and test points. We follow the guidelines below.

12

Review
Guidelines for Solving Rational Inequalities
1. Move everything to one side to get a 0 on the other side.
2. If needed, combine terms using a common denominator.
3. Factor the numerator and denominator.
4. Identify points where either the numerator or denominator is 0. Such points are called split
points.
5. Draw a number line and indicate your split points on the number line. Draw closed/open
circles for each split point depending on if that split point satisfies the inequality (division by
zero is not allowed).
6. The split points will split the number line into subintervals. For each subinterval pick a test
point and see if the expression in Step 3 is positive or negative. Indicate this with a + or −
symbol on the number line for that subinterval.
7. Now write your answer in set-builder notation. Use the union symbol ∪ if you have multiple
intervals in your solution.

Example 1.13: Rational Inequality

Write the solution to the following inequality using interval notation:
2−x
≥ 1.
2+x
Solution. One method to solve this inequality is to multiply both sides by 2 + x, but because we do not
know if 2 + x is positive or negative we must split it into two cases (Case 1: 2 + x > 0 and Case 2:
2 + x < 0).
Instead we follow the guidelines for solving rational inequalities:
Start with original problem:

2−x
≥1
2+x

Move everything to one side:

2−x
−1 ≥ 0
2+x

Find a common denominator:

2−x 2+x
−
≥0
2+x 2+x

Combine fractions:

(2 − x) − (2 + x)
≥0
2+x

Expand numerator:

2−x−2−x
≥0
2+x

Simplify numerator:

−2x
≥0
2+x

(∗)

1.1. Algebra

Now we have the numerator and denominator in fully factored form. The split points are x = 0 (makes
the numerator 0) and x = −2 (makes the denominator 0). Let us draw a number line with the split points
indicated on it:
‐2

0

The point x = 0 is included since if we sub x = 0 into (*) we get 0 ≥ 0 which is true. The point x = −2 is
not included since we cannot divide by zero. We indicate this with open/closed circles on the number line
(remember that open means omit):
‐2

0

Now choosing a test point from each of the three subintervals we can determine if the expression −2x
2+x is
positive or negative. When x = −3, it is negative. When x = −1, it is positive. When x = 1, it is negative.
Indicating this on the number line gives:

Since we wish to solve

−2x
2+x

‐

+
0

≥ 0, we look at where the + signs are and shade that area on the number line:

‐2

0

Since there is a closed circle at 0, we include it. Therefore, the solution is (−2, 0].

♣

Example 1.14: Rational Inequality

Write the solution to the following inequality using interval notation:
2
> 3x + 3.
x+2
Solution. We provide a brief outline of the solution. By subtracting (3x + 3) from both sides and using a
common denominator of x + 2, we can collect like terms and simplify to get:
−(3x2 + 9x + 4)
> 0.
x+2
The √denominator is zero when x = −2. Using the quadratic formula, the numerator is zero when x =
−9± 33
(these two numbers are approximately −2.46 and −0.54). Since the inequality uses “>” and
6
0 > 0 is false, we do not include any of the split points in our solution. After choosing suitable test points

1.1.5. The Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number x is written as |x| and represents the distance x is from zero. Mathematically, we define it as follows:

x, if x ≥ 0,
|x| =
−x, if x < 0.
Thus, if x is a negative real number, then −x is a positive real number. The absolute value does not just
turn minuses into pluses. That is, |2x − 1| =
6 2x + 1. You should be familiar with the following properties.
Absolute Value Properties
1. |x| ≥ 0.
2. |xy| = |x||y|.
3. |1/x| = 1/|x| when x 6= 0.
4. | − x| = |x|.
5. |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|. This is called the triangle inequality.
√
6. x2 = |x|.
√
Example 1.15: x2 = |x|
p
Observe that (−3)2 gives an answer of 3, not −3.
When solving inequalities with absolute values, the following are helpful.
Case 1: a > 0.
• |x| = a has solutions x = ±a.

• |x| ≤ a means x ≥ −a and x ≤ a (that is, −a ≤ x ≤ a).

• |x| < a means x < −a and x < a (that is, −a < x < a).

• |x| ≥ a means x ≤ −a or x ≥ a.

1.1. Algebra

15

• |x| > a means x < −a or x > a.
Case 2: a < 0.
• |x| = a has no solutions.

• Both |x| ≤ a and |x| < a have no solutions.

• Both |x| ≥ a and |x| > a have solution set {x|x ∈ R}.
Case 3: a = 0.
• |x| = 0 has solution x = 0.
• |x| < 0 has no solutions.

• |x| ≤ 0 has solution x = 0.

• |x| > 0 has solution set {x ∈ R|x 6= 0}.
• |x| ≥ 0 has solution set {x|x ∈ R}.

1.1.6. Solving Inequalities that Contain Absolute Values
We start by solving an equality that contains an absolute value. To do so, we recall that if a ≥ 0 then the
solution to |x| = a is x = ±a. In cases where we are not sure if the right side is positive or negative, we
must perform a check at the end.

Example 1.16: Absolute Value Equality

Solve for x in |2x + 3| = 2 − x.
Solution. This means that either:
2x + 3 = +(2 − x)
2x + 3 = 2 − x
3x = −1
x = −1/3

or 2x + 3 = −(2 − x)
or 2x + 3 = −2 + x
or
x = −5
or
x = −5

Since we do not know if the right side “a = 2 − x” is positive or negative, we must perform a check of our
answers and omit any that are incorrect.
If x = −1/3, then we have LS = |2(−1/3) + 3| = | − 2/3 + 3| = |7/3| = 7/3 and RS = 2 − (−1/3) =
7/3. In this case LS = RS, so x = −1/3 is a solution.
If x = −5, then we have LS = |2(−5) + 3| = | − 10 + 3| = | − 7| = 7 and RS = 2 − (−5) = 2 + 5 = 7.
In this case LS = RS, so x = −5 is a solution.
♣
We next look at absolute values and inequalities.

Review
Example 1.17: Absolute Value Inequality

Solve |x − 5| < 7.
Solution. This simply means −7 < x − 5 < 7. Adding 5 to each gives −2 < x < 12. Therefore the solution
is the interval (−2, 12).
♣
In some questions you must be careful when multiplying by a negative number as in the next problem.

Example 1.18: Absolute Value Inequality

Solve |2 − z| < 7.
Solution. This simply means −7 < 2 − z < 7. Subtracting 2 gives: −9 < −z < 5. Now multiplying by
−1 gives: 9 > z > −5. Remember to reverse the inequality signs! We can rearrange this as −5 < z < 9.
Therefore the solution is the interval (−5, 9).
♣
Example 1.19: Absolute Value Inequality

Solve |2 − z| ≥ 7.
Solution. Recall that for a > 0, |x| ≥ a means x ≤ −a or x ≥ a. Thus, either 2 − z ≤ −7 or 2 − z ≥ 7. Either
9 ≤ z or −5 ≥ z. Either z ≥ 9 or z ≤ −5. In interval notation, either z is in [9, ∞) or z is in (−∞, −5]. All
♣
together, we get our solution to be: (−∞, −5] ∪ [9, ∞).
In the previous two examples the only difference is that one had < in the question and the other had
≥. Combining the two solutions gives the entire real number line!
Example 1.20: Absolute Value Inequality

Solve 0 < |x − 5| ≤ 7.
Solution. We split this into two cases.
(1) For 0 < |x − 5| note that we always have that an absolute value is positive or zero (i.e., 0 ≤ |x − 5|
is always true). So, for this part, we need to avoid 0 = |x − 5| from occurring. Thus, x cannot be 5, that is,
x 6= 5.
(2) For |x − 5| ≤ 7, we have −7 ≤ x − 5 ≤ 7. Adding 5 to each gives −2 ≤ x ≤ 12. Therefore the
solution to |x − 5| ≤ 7 is the interval [−2, 12].
To combine (1) and (2) we need combine x 6= 5 with x ∈ [−2, 12]. Omitting 5 from the interval [−2, 12]
gives our solution to be: [−2, 5) ∪ (5, 12].

1.2 Analytic Geometry
In what follows, we use the notation (x1 , y1 ) to represent a point in the (x, y) coordinate system, also called
the (x, y)-plane. Previously, we used (a, b) to represent an open interval. Notation often gets reused and
abused in mathematics, but thankfully, it is usually clear from the context what we mean.
In the (x, y) coordinate system we normally write the x-axis horizontally, with positive numbers to the
right of the origin, and the y-axis vertically, with positive numbers above the origin. That is, unless stated
otherwise, we take “rightward” to be the positive x-direction and “upward” to be the positive y-direction.
In a purely mathematical situation, we normally choose the same scale for the x- and y-axes. For example,
the line joining the origin to the point (a, a) makes an angle of 45◦ with the x-axis (and also with the
y-axis).
In applications, often letters other than x and y are used, and often different scales are chosen in the
horizontal and vertical directions.
Example 1.21: Data Plot

Suppose you drop a coin from a window, and you want to study how its height above the ground
changes from second to second. It is natural to let the letter t denote the time (the number of seconds
since the object was released) and to let the letter h denote the height. For each t (say, at one-second
intervals) you have a corresponding height h. This information can be tabulated, and then plotted
on the (t, h) coordinate plane, as shown in figure 1.1.
We use the word “quadrant” for each of the four regions into which the plane is divided by the axes:
the first quadrant is where points have both coordinates positive, or the “northeast” portion of the plot, and
the second, third, and fourth quadrants are counted off counterclockwise, so the second quadrant is the
northwest, the third is the southwest, and the fourth is the southeast.
Suppose we have two points A and B in the (x, y)-plane. We often want to know the change in xcoordinate (also called the “horizontal distance”) in going from A to B. This is often written ∆x, where
the meaning of ∆ (a capital delta in the Greek alphabet) is “change in”. Thus, ∆x can be read as “change
in x” although it usually is read as “delta x”. The point is that ∆x denotes a single number, and should not
be interpreted as “delta times x”. Similarly, the “change in y” is written ∆y and represents the difference
between the y-coordinates of the two points. It is the vertical distance you have to move in going from A
to B.

Example 1.22: Change in x and y

If A = (2, 1) and B = (3, 3) the change in x is
∆x = 3 − 2 = 1

while the change in y is
∆y = 3 − 1 = 2.
The general formulas for the change in x and the change in y between a point (x1 , y1 ) and a point
(x2 , y2 ) are:
∆x = x2 − x1 ,
∆y = y2 − y1 .
Note that either or both of these might be negative.

1.2.1. Lines
If we have two distinct points A(x1 , y1 ) and B(x2 , y2 ), then we can draw one and only one straight line
through both points. By the slope of this line we mean the ratio of ∆y to ∆x. The slope is often denoted by
the letter m.

Slope Formula
The slope of the line joining the points (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) is:

Example 1.23: Slope of a Line Joining Two Points

The line joining the two points (1, −2) and (3, 5) has slope m =

5 − (−2) 7
= .
3−1
2

The most familiar form of the equation of a straight line is:
y = mx + b.
Here m is the slope of the line: if you increase x by 1, the equation tells you that you have to increase
y by m; and if you increase x by ∆x, then y increases by ∆y = m∆x. The number b is called the yintercept, because it is where the line crosses the y-axis (when x = 0). If you know two points on a line,
the formula m = (y2 − y1 )/(x2 − x1 ) gives you the slope. Once you know a point and the slope, then the
y-intercept can be found by substituting the coordinates of either point in the equation: y1 = mx1 + b, i.e.,
b = y1 − mx1 . Alternatively, one can use the “point-slope” form of the equation of a straight line: start
with (y − y1 )/(x − x1 ) = m and then multiply to get
(y − y1 ) = m(x − x1 ),
the point-slope form. Of course, this may be further manipulated to get y = mx − mx1 + y1 , which is
essentially the “y = mx + b” form.
It is possible to find the equation of a line between two points directly from the relation m = (y −
y1 )/(x − x1 ) = (y2 − y1 )/(x2 − x1 ), which says “the slope measured between the point (x1 , y1 ) and the
point (x2 , y2 ) is the same as the slope measured between the point (x1 , y1 ) and any other point (x, y) on the
line.” For example, if we want to find the equation of the line joining our earlier points A(2, 1) and B(3, 3),
we can use this formula:
m=

y−1 3−1
=
= 2,
x−2 3−2

so that

y − 1 = 2(x − 2),

i.e.,

y = 2x − 3.

Of course, this is really just the point-slope formula, except that we are not computing m in a separate step.
We summarize the three common forms of writing a straight line below:

Slope-Intercept Form of a Straight Line
An equation of a line with slope m and y-intercept b is:
y = mx + b.

Point-Slope Form of a Straight Line
An equation of a line passing through (x1 , y1 ) and having slope m is:
y − y1 = m(x − x1 ).

1.2. Analytic Geometry

21

General Form of a Straight Line
Any line can be written in the form
Ax + By +C = 0,
where A, B,C are constants and A, B are not both 0.
The slope m of a line in the form y = mx + b tells us the direction in which the line is pointing. If m
is positive, the line goes into the 1st quadrant as you go from left to right. If m is large and positive, it
has a steep incline, while if m is small and positive, then the line has a small angle of inclination. If m is
negative, the line goes into the 4th quadrant as you go from left to right. If m is a large negative number
(large in absolute value), then the line points steeply downward. If m is negative but small in absolute
value, then it points only a little downward.
If m = 0, then the line is horizontal and its equation is simply y = b.
All of these possibilities are illustrated below.

There is one type of line that cannot be written in the form y = mx+b, namely, vertical lines. A vertical
line has an equation of the form x = a. Sometimes one says that a vertical line has an “infinite” slope.
It is often useful to find the x-intercept of a line y = mx + b. This is the x-value when y = 0. Setting
mx + b equal to 0 and solving for x gives: x = −b/m.
Example 1.24: Finding x-intercepts

To find x-intercept(s) of the line y = 2x − 3 we set y = 0 and solve for x:
0 = 2x − 3

→

3
x= .
2

Thus, the line has an x-intercept of 3/2.
It is often necessary to know if two lines are parallel or perpendicular. Let m1 and m2 be the slopes of
the nonvertical lines L1 and L2 . Then:
• L1 and L2 are parallel if and only if m1 = m2 .
• L1 and L2 are perpendicular if and only if m2 =

−1
. (Equivalently, m1 =
m1

−1
m2 ).

1.2.2. Distance between Two Points and Midpoints
Given two points (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ), recall that their horizontal distance from one another is ∆x = x2 − x1
and their vertical distance from one another is ∆y = y2 − y1 . Actually, the word “distance” normally
denotes “positive distance”. ∆x and ∆y are signed distances, but this is clear from context. The (positive)
distance from one point to the other is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs |∆x| and
|∆y|, as shown in figure 1.2. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the distance between the two points is
the square root of the sum of the squares of the horizontal and vertical sides:

d = (3 − 2)2 + (3 − 1)2 = 5.

(x − 0)2 + (y − 0)2 = x2 + y2 .

A point (x, y) is at a distance r from the origin if and only if x2 + y2 = r, or, if we square both sides:
x2 + y2 = r2 . As we will see, this is the equation of the circle of radius, r, centered at the origin.
Furthermore, given two points we can determine the midpoint of the line segment joining the two
points.

Determining the Type of Conic
An equation of the form
Ax2 + Bxy +Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0
gives rise to a graph that can be generated by performing a conic section (parabolas, circles, ellipses,
hyperbolas). Note that the Bxy term involves conic rotation. The Dx, Ex, and F terms affect the
vertex and centre. For simplicity, we will omit the Bxy term. To determine the type of graph we
focus our analysis on the values of A and C.
• If A = C, the graph is a circle.
• If AC > 0 (and A 6= C), the graph is an ellipse.
• If AC = 0, the graph is a parabola.

• If AC < 0, the graph is a hyperbola.

Example 1.29: Center and Radius of a Circle

Find the centre and radius of the circle y2 + x2 − 12x + 8y + 43 = 0.
Solution. We need to complete the square twice, once for the x terms and once for the y terms. We’ll do
both at the same time. First let’s collect the terms with x together, the terms with y together, and move the
number to the other side.
(x2 − 12x) + (y2 + 8y) = −43
We add 36 to both sides for the x term (−12 →
term (8 → 28 = 4 → (4)2 = 16):

−12
2

= −6 → (−6)2 = 36), and 16 to both sides for the y

(x2 − 12x + 36) + (y2 + 8y + 16) = −43 + 36 + 16
Factoring gives:
(x − 6)2 + (y + 4)2 = 32 .
Therefore, the centre of the circle is (6, −4) and the radius is 3.

Example 1.30: Type of Conic

What type of conic is 4x2 − y2 − 8x + 8 = 0? Put it in standard form.
Solution. Here we have A = 4 and C = −1. Since AC < 0, the conic is a hyperbola. Let us complete the
square for the x and y terms. First let’s collect the terms with x together, the terms with y together, and
move the number to the other side.
(4x2 − 8x) − y2 = −8
Now we factor out 4 from the x terms.
4(x2 − 2x) − y2 = −8

1.2. Analytic Geometry

Notice that we don’t need to complete the square for the y terms (it is already completed!). To complete
2
the square for the x terms we add 1 since −2 → −2
2 = −1 → (−1) = 1, taking into consideration that the
a value is 4:
4(x2 − 2x + 1) − y2 = −8 + 4 · 1
Factoring gives:

4(x − 1)2 − y2 = −4

A hyperbola in standard form has ±1 on the right side and a positive x2 on the left side, thus, we must
divide by 4:
y2
(x − 1)2 − = −1

Example 1.31: Equation of Parabola

Find an equation of the parabola with vertex (1, −1) that passes through the points (−4, 24) and
(7, 35).
Solution. We first need to determine if it is a vertical parabola or horizontal parabola. See figure 1.3 for
a sketch of the three points (1, −1), (−4, 24) and (7, 35) in the xy-plane. Note that the vertex is (1, −1).

y

x
Figure 1.3: Figure for Example 1.31
Given the location of the vertex, the parabola cannot open downwards. It also cannot open left or right
(because the vertex is between the other two points - if it were to open to the right, every other point would
need to be to the right of the vertex; if it were to open to the left, every other point would need to be to
the left of the vertex). Therefore, the parabola must open upwards and it is a vertical parabola. It has an
equation of
y − k = a(x − h)2 .
As the vertex is (h, k) = (1, −1) we have:

y − (−1) = a(x − 1)2

To determine a, we substitute one of the points into the equation and solve. Let us substitute the point
(x, y) = (−4, 24) into the equation:
24 − (−1) = a(−4 − 1)2

→

25 = 25a

Therefore, the equation of the parabola is:

Note that if we substituted (7, 35) into the equation instead, we would also get a = 1.

1.3 Trigonometry
In this section we review the definitions of trigonometric functions.

1.3.1. Angles and Sectors of Circles
Mathematicians tend to deal mostly with radians and we will see later that some formulas are more elegant
when using radians (rather than degrees). The relationship between degrees and radians is:

π rad = 180◦ .
Using this formula, some common angles can be derived:
Degrees 0◦ 30◦ 45◦ 60◦ 90◦ 120◦ 135◦ 150◦ 180◦ 270◦ 360◦

In the diagram below is a sector of a circle with central angle θ and radius r subtending an arc with
length s.

When θ is measure in radians, we have the following formula relating θ , s and r:

θ=

or

s = rθ .

Sector Area
The area of the sector is equal to:
1
Sector Area = r2 θ .

Example 1.34: Angle Subtended by Arc

If a circle has radius 3 cm, then an angle of 2 rad is subtended by an arc of 6 cm (s = rθ = 3 · 2 = 6).

1.3.2. Trigonometric Functions
There are six basic trigonometric functions:
• Sine (abbreviated by sin)

• Tangent (abbreviated by tan)

• Cosine (abbreviated by cos)

• Cosecant (abbreviated by csc)

34

Review
• Secant (abbreviated by sec)

• Cotangent (abbreviated by cot)

We first describe trigonometric functions in terms of ratios of two sides of a right angle triangle
containing the angle θ .

With reference to the above triangle, for an acute angle θ (that is, 0 ≤ θ < π /2), the six trigonometric
functions can be described as follows:
sin θ =

csc θ =

cos θ =

sec θ =

cot θ =

Notice that sin is the ratio of the opposite and hypotenuse. We use the mnemonic SOH to remember
this ratio. Similarly, CAH and TOA remind us of the cos and tan ratios.
Mnemonic
The mnemonic SOH CAH TOA is useful in remembering how trigonometric functions of acute
angles relate to the sides of a right triangle.
This description does not apply to obtuse or negative angles. To define the six basic trigonometric
functions we first define sine and cosine as the lengths of various line segments from a unit circle, and
then we define the remaining four basic trigonometric functions in terms of sine and cosine.
Take a line originating at the origin (making an angle of θ with the positive half of the x-axis) and
suppose this line intersects the unit circle at the point (x, y). The x- and y-coordinates of this point of

1.3. Trigonometry

35

intersection are equal to cos θ and sin θ , respectively.

1

For angles greater than 2π or less than −2π , simply continue to rotate around the circle. In this way, sine
and cosine become periodic functions with period 2π :
sin θ = sin (θ + 2π k)

cos θ = cos (θ + 2π k)

for any angle θ and any integer k.
Above, only sine and cosine were defined directly by the circle. We now define the remaining four
basic trigonometric functions in terms of the functions sin θ and cos θ :
tan θ =

sin θ
cos θ

sec θ =

cos θ

csc θ =

1.3.3. Computing Exact Trigonometric Ratios
The unit circle is often used to determine the exact value of a particular trigonometric function.

36

Review

√
Reading from the unit circle one can see that cos 5π /6 = − 3/2 and sin 5π /6 = 1/2 (remember the
that the x-coordinate is cos θ and the y-coordinate is sin θ ). However, we don’t always have access to the
unit circle. In this case, we can compute the exact trigonometric ratios for θ = 5π /6 by using special
triangles and the CAST rule described below.
√
The first special triangle has angles of 45◦ , 45◦ , 90◦ (i.e., π /4, π /4, π /2) with side lengths 1, 1, √2,
◦
◦
◦
while the second special triangle has angles
√of 30 , 60 , 90 (i.e., π /6,
√ π /3, π /2) with side lengths 1, 2, 3.
They are classically referred to as the 1-1- 2 triangle, and the 1-2- 3 triangle, respectively, shown below.

1.3. Trigonometry

37

Mnemonic
The first triangle should be easy to remember. To remember the second triangle, place the largest
number (2) across from the largest angle (90◦ = π /2). Place
√ the smallest number (1) across from
the smallest angle (30◦ = π /6). Place the middle number ( 3 ≈ 1.73) across from the middle angle
(60◦ = π /3). Double check using the Pythagorean Theorem that the sides satisfy a2 + b2 = c2 .
The special triangles allow us to compute the exact value (excluding the sign) of trigonometric ratios,
but to determine the sign, we can use the CAST rule.
The CAST Rule
The CAST rule says that in quadrant I all three of sin θ , cos θ , tan θ are positive. In quadrant II,
only sin θ is positive, while cos θ , tan θ are negative. In quadrant III, only tan θ is positive, while
sin θ , cos θ are negative. In quadrant IV, only cos θ is positive, while sin θ , tan θ are negative. To
remember this, simply label the quadrants by the letters C-A-S-T starting in the bottom right and
labelling counter-clockwise.

Example 1.36: Determining Trigonometric Ratios Without Unit Circle

Determine sin 5π /6, cos 5π /6, tan 5π /6, sec 5π /6, csc 5π /6 and cot 5π /6 exactly by using the special triangles and CAST rule.
Solution. We start by drawing the xy-plane and indicating our angle of 5π /6 in standard position (positive
angles rotate counterclockwise while negative angles rotate clockwise). Next, we drop a perpendicular to

38

Review

the x-axis (never drop it to the y-axis!).

Notice that we can now figure out the angles in the triangle. Since 180◦ = π , we have an interior angle of
π − 5π /6 = π /6 inside the triangle. As the angles of a triangle add up to 180◦ = π , the other angle must
be π /3. This gives one of our special triangles. We label it accordingly and add the CAST rule to our
diagram.

From the above figure we see that 5π /6 lies in quadrant II where sin θ is positive and cos θ and tan θ are
negative. This gives us the sign of sin θ , cos θ and tan θ . To determine the value we use the special triangle
and SOH CAH TOA.
Using sin θ = opp/hyp we find a value of 1/2. Since sin θ is positive in quadrant II, we have

The zeros of sin x occur at the integer multiples of π , that is, sin x = 0 whenever x = nπ , where n is an

• cos(θ − φ ) = cos θ cos φ + sin θ sin φ

Example 1.38: Double Angle

Find all values of x with 0 ≤ x ≤ π such that sin 2x = sin x.
Solution. Using the double-angle formula sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x we have:
2 sin x cos x = sin x
2 sin x cos x − sin x = 0
sin x(2 cos x − 1) = 0
Thus, either sin x = 0 or cos x = 1/2. For the first case when sin x = 0, we get x = 0 or x = π . For the
second case when cos x = 1/2, we get x = π /3 (use the special triangles and CAST rule to get this). Thus,
we have three solutions: x = 0, x = π /3, x = π .

2. Functions
2.1 What is a Function?
A function y = f (x) is a rule for determining y when we’re given a value of x. For example, the rule
y = f (x) = 2x + 1 is a function. Any line y = mx + b is called a linear function. The graph of a function
looks like a curve above (or below) the x-axis, where for any value of x the rule y = f (x) tells us how far
to go above (or below) the x-axis to reach the curve.
Functions can be defined in various ways: by an algebraic formula or several algebraic formulas, by
a graph, or by an experimentally determined table of values. In the latter case, the table gives a bunch of
points in the plane, which we might then interpolate with a smooth curve, if that makes sense.
Given a value of x, a function must give at most one value of y. Thus, vertical lines are not functions.
For example, the line x = 1 has infinitely many values of y if x = 1. It is also true that if x is any number
(not 1) there is no y which corresponds to x, but that is not a problem—only multiple y values is a problem.
One test to identify whether or not a curve in the (x, y) coordinate system is a function is the following.
Theorem 2.1: The Vertical Line Test

A curve in the (x, y) coordinate system represents a function if and only if no vertical line intersects
the curve more than once.
In addition to lines, another familiar example of a function is the parabola y = f (x) = x2 . We can draw
the graph of this function by taking various values of x (say, at regular intervals) and plotting the points
(x, f (x)) = (x, x2 ). Then connect the points with a smooth curve. (See figure 2.1.)
The two examples y = f (x) = 2x + 1 and y = f (x) = x2 are both functions which can be evaluated at
any value of x from negative infinity to positive infinity. For many functions, however, it only makes sense
to take x in some interval or outside of some “forbidden” region. The interval of x-values at which we’re
allowed to evaluate the function is called the domain of the function.

Figure 2.1: Graphs of Functions

Example 2.2: Domain of the Square-Root Function
√
The square-root function y = f (x) = x is the rule which says, given an x-value, take the nonnegative number whose square is x. This rule only makes sense if x ≥ 0. We say that the domain of
this function is x ≥ 0, or more formally {x ∈ R : x ≥ 0}. Alternately,√we can use interval notation,
and write that the domain is [0, ∞). The fact that the domain of y = x is [0, ∞) means that in the
graph of this function (see figure 2.1) we have points (x, y) only above x-values on the right side of
the x-axis.
Another example of a function whose domain is not the entire x-axis is: y = f (x) = 1/x, the reciprocal
function. We cannot substitute x = 0 in this formula. The function makes sense, however, for any nonzero
x, so we take the domain to be: {x ∈ R : x 6= 0}. The graph of this function does not have any point (x, y)
with x = 0. As x gets close to 0 from either side, the graph goes off toward infinity. We call the vertical
line x = 0 an asymptote.
To summarize, two reasons why certain x-values are excluded from the domain of a function are the
following.
Restrictions for the Domain of a Function
1. We cannot divide by zero, and
2. We cannot take the square root of a negative number.
When the domain of a function is restricted, we say that the function is undefined at that point. We
will encounter some other ways in which functions might be undefined later.
Another reason why the domain of a function might be restricted is that in a given situation the x-values
outside of some range might have no practical meaning. For example, if y is the area of a square of side x,
then we can write y = f (x) = x2 . In a purely mathematical context the domain of the function y = x2 is all
of R. However, in the story-problem context of finding areas of squares, we restrict the domain to positive
values of x, because a square with negative or zero side makes no sense.
In a problem in pure mathematics, we usually take the domain to be all values of x at which the
formulas can be evaluated. However, in a story problem there might be further restrictions on the domain
because only certain values of x are of interest or make practical sense.

2.1. What is a Function?

47

In a story problem, we often use letters other than x and y. For example, the volume V of a sphere
is a function of the radius r, given by the formula V = f (r) = 34 π r3 . Also, letters different from f may
be used. For example, if y is the velocity of something at time t, we may write y = v(t) with the letter v
(instead of f ) standing for the velocity function (and t playing the role of x).
The letter playing the role of x is called the independent variable, and the letter playing the role of y
is called the dependent variable (because its value “depends on” the value of the independent variable).
In story problems, when one has to translate from English into mathematics, a crucial step is to determine
what letters stand for variables. If only words and no letters are given, then we have to decide which letters
to use. Some letters are traditional. For example, almost always, t stands for time.
Example 2.3: Open Box

An open-top box is made from an a × b rectangular piece of cardboard by cutting out a square of
side x from each of the four corners, and then folding the sides up and sealing them with duct tape.
Find a formula for the volume V of the box as a function of x, and find the domain of this function.
Solution. The box we get will have height x and rectangular base of dimensions a − 2x by b − 2x. Thus,
V = f (x) = x(a − 2x)(b − 2x).
Here a and b are constants, and V is the variable that depends on x, i.e., V is playing the role of y.
This formula makes mathematical sense for any x, but in the story problem the domain is much less.
In the first place, x must be positive. In the second place, it must be less than half the length of either of
the sides of the cardboard. Thus, the domain is


1
x ∈ R : 0 < x < (minimum of a and b) .
2
In interval notation we write: the domain is the interval (0, min(a, b)/2). You might think about whether
we could allow 0 or (the minimum of a and b) to be in the domain. They make a certain physical sense,
though we normally would not call the result a box. If we were to allow these values, what would the
♣
corresponding volumes be? Does that volume make sense?
Example 2.4: Circle of Radius r Centered at the Origin

Is the circle of radius r centered at the origin the graph of a function?
2
2
2
Solution. The equation for this circle is usually given
√ in the form x + y = r . To write the equation in
the form y = f (x) we solve for y, obtaining y = ± r2 − x2 . But this is not a function, because when we
substitute a value in the interval (−r, r) for x there are two corresponding values of y. To get a function, we
must choose one of the two signs in front √
of the square root. If we choose the positive sign, for example,
we get the upper semicircle y = f (x) = r2 − x2 (see figure 2.2). The domain of this function is the
interval [−r, r], i.e., x must be between −r and r (including the endpoints). If x is outside of that interval,
then r2 − x2 is negative, and we cannot take the square root. In terms of the graph, this just means that
there are no points on the curve whose x-coordinate is greater than r or less than −r.

Example 2.5: Domain

Find the domain of
y = f (x) = √

1
4x − x2

.

Solution. To answer this question, we must rule out the x-values that make 4x − x2 negative (because we
cannot take the square root of a negative number) and also the x-values that make 4x − x2 zero (because
if 4x − x2 = 0, then when we take the square root we get 0, and we cannot divide by 0). In other words,
the domain consists of all x for which 4x − x2 is strictly positive. The inequality 4x − x2 > 0 was solved in
Example 1.12. In interval notation, the domain is the interval (0, 4).
♣
A function does not always have to be given by a single formula as the next example demonstrates.
Example 2.6: Piecewise Velocity

Suppose that y = v(t) is the velocity function for a car which starts out from rest (zero velocity) at
time t = 0; then increases its speed steadily to 20 m/sec, taking 10 seconds to do this; then travels
at constant speed 20 m/sec for 15 seconds; and finally applies the brakes to decrease speed steadily
to 0, taking 5 seconds to do this. The formula for y = v(t) is different in each of the three time
intervals: first y = 2x, then y = 20, then y = −4x + 120. The graph of this function is shown in
figure 2.3.

2.2 Transformations and Compositions
2.2.1. Transformations
Transformations are operations we can apply to a function in order to obtain a new function. The most
common transformations include translations (shifts), stretches and reflections. We summarize these below.
Function
F(x) = f (x) + c
F(x) = f (x) − c
F(x) = f (x + c)
F(x) = f (x − c)
F(x) = − f (x)
F(x) = f (−x)
F(x) = | f (x)|

Conditions
c>0
c>0
c>0
c>0

How to graph F(x) given the graph of f (x)
Shift f (x) upwards by c units
Shift f (x) downwards by c units
Shift f (x) to the left by c units
Shift f (x) to the right by c units
Reflect f (x) about the x-axis
Reflect f (x) about the y-axis
Take the part of the graph of f (x) that lies
below the x-axis and reflect it about the x-axis

For horizontal and vertical stretches, different resources use different terminology and notation. Use
the one you are most comfortable with! Below, both a, b are positive numbers. Note that we only use the
term stretch in this case:
Function
F(x) = a f (x)
F(x) = f (bx)

Conditions
a>0
b>0

How to graph F(x) given the graph of f (x)
Stretch f (x) vertically by a factor of a
Stretch f (x) horizontally by a factor of 1/b

In the next case, we use both the terms stretch and shrink. We also split up vertical stretches into two
cases (0 < a < 1 and a > 1), and split up horizontal stretches into two cases (0 < b < 1 and b > 1). Note
that having 0 < a < 1 is the same as having 1/c with c > 1. Also note that stretching by a factor of 1/c is
the same as shrinking by a factor c.
Function
F(x) = c f (x)
F(x) = (1/c) f (x)
F(x) = f (cx)
F(x) = f (x/c)

Some resources keep the condition 0 < c < 1 rather than using 1/c. This is illustrated in the next table.
Function
F(x) = d f (x)
F(x) = d f (x)
F(x) = f (dx)
F(x) = f (dx)

Conditions

2.2.2. Combining Two Functions
Let f and g be two functions. Then we can form new functions by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or
dividing. These new functions, f + g, f − g, f g and f /g, are defined in the usual way.
Operations on Functions
( f + g)(x) = f (x) + g(x)
( f g)(x) = f (x)g(x)

( f − g)(x) = f (x) − g(x)
 
f
f (x)
(x) =
g
g(x)

Suppose D f is the domain of f and Dg is the domain of g. Then the domains of f + g, f − g and
f g are the same and are equal to the intersection D f ∩ Dg (that is, everything that is in common to both
the domain of f and the domain of g). Since division by zero is not allowed, the domain of f /g is
{x ∈ D f ∩ Dg : g(x) 6= 0}.
Another way to combine two functions f and g together is a procedure called composition.
Function Composition
Given two functions f and g, the composition of f and g, denoted by f ◦ g, is defined as:
( f ◦ g)(x) = f (g(x)).
The domain of f ◦ g is {x ∈ Dg : g(x) ∈ D f }, that is, it contains all values x in the domain of g such
that g(x) is in the domain of f .
Example 2.8: Domain of a Composition
√
Let f (x) = x2 and g(x) = x. Find the domain of f ◦ g.
Solution. The domain of f is D f = {x ∈ R}. The domain of g is Dg = {x ∈ R : x ≥ 0}. The function
( f ◦ g)(x) = f (g(x)) is:
√ 2
f (g(x)) =
x = x.
Typically, h(x) = x would have a domain of {x ∈ R}, but since it came from a composed function, we
must consider g(x) when looking at the domain of f (g(x)). Thus, the domain of f ◦ g is {x ∈ R : x ≥ 0}.
♣
Example 2.9: Combining Two Functions

Let f (x) = x2 + 3 and g(x) = x − 2. Find f + g, f − g, f g, f /g, f ◦ g and g ◦ f . Also, determine the
domains of these new functions.

2.2. Transformations and Compositions

53

Solution. For f + g we have:
( f + g)(x) = f (x) + g(x) = (x2 + 3) + (x − 2) = x2 + x + 1.
For f − g we have:
( f − g)(x) = f (x) − g(x) = (x2 + 3) − (x − 2) = x2 + 3 − x + 2 = x2 − x + 5.
For f g we have:
( f g)(x) = f (x) · g(x) = (x2 + 3)(x − 2) = x3 − 2x2 + 3x − 6.
For f /g we have:

For f ◦ g we have:

( f ◦ g)(x) = f (g(x)) = f (x − 2) = (x − 2)2 + 3 = x2 − 4x + 7.
For g ◦ f we have:

(g ◦ f )(x) = g( f (x)) = g(x2 + 3) = (x2 + 3) − 2 = x2 + 1.

The domains of f + g, f − g, f g, f ◦ g and g ◦ f is {x ∈ R}, while the domain of f /g is {x ∈ R : x 6= 2}.
♣
As in the above problem, f ◦ g and g ◦ f are generally different functions.

2.3 Exponential Functions
An exponential function is a function of the form f (x) = ax , where a is a constant. Examples are 2x , 10x
and (1/2)x. To more formally define the exponential function we look at various kinds of input values.
It is obvious that a5 = a · a · a · a · a and a3 = a · a · a, but when we consider an exponential function ax
we can’t be limited to substituting integers for x. What does a2.5 or a−1.3 or aπ mean? And is it really true
that a2.5 a−1.3 = a2.5−1.3 ? The answer to the first question is actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the
answer to the second question is “yes.”
We’ll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about exponential
functions. You need first to understand that since it’s not “obvious” what 2x should mean, we are really
free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the behavior that is obvious, namely, when x
is a positive integer. What else do we want to be true about 2x ? We want the properties of the previous
two paragraphs to be true for all exponents: 2x 2y = 2x+y and (2x )y = 2xy .
After the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: 20 = 1. You have presumably
learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want 2a 2b = 2a+b to be true
about the function 2x . We need it to be true that 20 2x = 20+x = 2x , and this only works if 20 = 1. The same
argument implies that a0 = 1 for any a.
The next easiest set of numbers to understand is the negative integers: for example, 2−3 = 1/23 . We
know that whatever 2−3 means it must be that 2−3 23 = 2−3+3 = 20 = 1, which means that 2−3 must be
1/23 . In fact, by the same argument, once we know what 2x means for some value of x, 2−x must be 1/2x
and more generally a−x = 1/ax .
Next, consider an exponent 1/q, where q is a positive integer.
We want it to be true that (2x )y = 2xy ,
√
q
so (21/q )q = 2. This
means that 21/q is a q-th root
of 2, 21/q = 2 . This is all we need to understand that
√
√
2 p/q = (21/q ) p = ( q 2 ) p and a p/q = (a1/q ) p = ( q a ) p .

2.3. Exponential Functions

55

√
What’s left is the hard part: what does 2x mean when x cannot be written as a fraction, like x = 2 or
x = π ? What we know so far is how to assign meaning to 2x whenever x = p/q. If we were to graph ax
(for some a > 1) at points x = p/q then we’d see something like this:
y

x

This is a poor picture, but it illustrates a series of individual points above the rational numbers on the
x-axis. There are really a lot of “holes” in the curve, above x = π , for example. But (this is the hard part)
it is possible to prove that the holes can be “filled in”, and that the resulting function, called ax , really does
have the properties we want, namely that ax ay = ax+y and (ax )y = axy . Such a graph would then look like
this:
y

x

Three Types of Exponential Functions
There are three kinds of exponential functions f (x) = ax depending on whether a > 1, a = 1 or
0 < a < 1:

Functions

Properties of Exponential Functions
The first thing to note is that if a < 0 then problems can occur. Observe that if a√= −1 then (−1)x is not
defined for every x. For example, x = 1/2 is a square root and gives (−1)1/2 = −1 which is not a real
number.
Exponential Function Properties
• Only defined for positive a: ax is only defined for all real x if a > 0
• Always positive: ax > 0, for all x
• Exponent rules:
3. (ax )y = axy = ayx = (ay )x

1. ax ay = ax+y
ax
2. y = ax−y
a

4. ax bx = (ab)x

• Long term behaviour: If a > 1, then ax → ∞ as x → ∞ and ax → 0 as x → −∞.
The last property can be observed from the graph. If a > 1, then as x gets larger and larger, so does ax .
On the other hand, as x gets large and negative, the function approaches the x-axis, that is, ax approaches
0.
Example 2.10: Reflection of Exponential

Determine an equation of the function after reflecting y = 2x about the line x = −2.
Solution. First reflect about the y-axis to get y = 2−x . Now shift by 2 × 2 = 4 units to the left to get
y = 2−(x+4) . Side note: Can you see why this sequence of transformations is the same as reflection in the
♣
line x = −2? Can you come up with a general rule for these types of reflections?
Example 2.11: Determine the Exponential Function

Determine the exponential function f (x) = kax that passes through the points (1, 6) and (2, 18).
Solution. We substitute our two points into the equation to get:
x = 1, y = 6 → 6 = ka1
x = 2, y = 18 → 18 = ka2

This gives us 6 = ka and 18 = ka2 . The first equation is k = 6/a and subbing this into the second gives:
18 = (6/a)a2. Thus, 18 = 6a and a = 3. Now we can see from 6 = ka that k = 2. Therefore, the exponential
function is
f (x) = 2 · 3x.

2.4. Inverse Functions

♣

There is one base that is so important and convenient that we give it a special symbol. This number
is denoted by e = 2.71828 . . . (and is an irrational number). Its importance stems from the fact that it
simplifies many formulas of Calculus and also shows up in other fields of mathematics.

Solution. For domain, we cannot divide by zero or take the square root of negative numbers. Note that
one of the properties of exponentials is that they are always positive! Thus, ex + 1 > 0 (in fact, as ex > 0
we actually have that ex + 1 is at least one). Therefore, ex + 1 is never zero nor negative, and gives no
restrictions on x. Thus, the domain is R.

2.4 Inverse Functions
In mathematics, an inverse is a function that serves to “undo” another function. That is, if f (x) produces
y, then putting y into the inverse of f produces the output x. A function f that has an inverse is called
invertible and the inverse is denoted by f −1 . It is best to illustrate inverses using an arrow diagram:

Functions

Notice how f maps 1 to a, and f −1 undoes this, that is, f −1 maps a back to 1. Don’t confuse f −1 (x) with
1
exponentiation: the inverse f −1 is different from f (x)
.
Not every function has an inverse. It is easy to see that if a function f (x) is going to have an inverse,
then f (x) never takes on the same value twice. We give this property a special name.
A function f (x) is called one-to-one if every element of the range corresponds to exactly one element
of the domain. Similar to the Vertical Line Test (VLT) for functions, we have the Horizontal Line Test
(HLT) for the one-to-one property.
Theorem 2.13: The Horizontal Line Test

A function is one-to-one if and only if there is no horizontal line that intersects its graph more than
once.

Example 2.14: Parabola is Not One-to-one

The parabola f (x) = x2 it not one-to-one because it does not satisfy the horizontal line test. For
example, the horizontal line y = 1 intersects the parabola at two points, when x = −1 and x = 1.
We now formally define the inverse of a function.
Definition 2.15: Inverse of a Function

Let f (x) and g(x) be two one-to-one functions. If ( f ◦ g)(x) = x and (g ◦ f )(x) = x then we say that
f (x) and g(x) are inverses of each other. We denote g(x) (the inverse of f (x)) by g(x) = f −1 (x).
Thus, if f maps x to y, then f −1 maps y back to x. This gives rise to the cancellation formulas:
f −1 ( f (x)) = x,
f ( f −1 (x)) = x,

for every x in the domain of f (x),
for every x in the domain of f −1 (x).

Example 2.16: Finding the Inverse at Specific Values

If f (x) = x9 + 2x7 + x + 1, find f −1 (5) and f −1 (1).
Solution. Rather than trying to compute a formula for f −1 and then computing f −1 (5), we can simply find a number c such that f evaluated at c gives 5. Note that subbing in some simple values (x =
−3, −2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3) and evaluating f (x) we eventually find that f (1) = 19 +2(17 ) +1 +1 = 5 and f (0) = 1.
Therefore, f −1 (5) = 1 and f −1 (1) = 0.
♣
To compute the equation of the inverse of a function we use the following guidelines.

2.4. Inverse Functions

59

Guidelines for Computing Inverses
1. Write down y = f (x).
2. Solve for x in terms of y.
3. Switch the x’s and y’s.
4. The result is y = f −1 (x).

Example 2.17: Finding the Inverse Function

We find the inverse of the function f (x) = 2x3 + 1.
Solution. Starting with y = 2x3 + 1 we solve for x as follows:
y − 1 = 2x3

This example shows how to find the inverse of a function algebraically. But what about finding the
inverse of a function graphically? Step 3 (switching x and y) gives us a good graphical technique to find
the inverse, namely, for each point (a, b) where f (a) = b, sketch the point (b, a) for the inverse. More
formally, to obtain f −1 (x) reflect the graph f (x) about the line y = x.

2.5 Logarithms
Recall the three kinds of exponential functions f (x) = ax depending on whether 0 < a < 1, a = 1 or a > 1:
y

y

x

x

x

So long as a 6= 1, the function f (x) = ax satisfies the horizontal line test and therefore has an inverse. We
call the inverse of ax the logarithmic function with base a and denote it by loga . In particular,
loga x = y ⇐⇒ ay = x.
The cancellation formulas for logs are:
loga (ax ) = x,

for every x ∈ R,

aloga (x) = x,

for every x > 0.

Since the function f (x) = ax for a 6= 1 has domain R and range (0, ∞), the logarithmic function has domain
(0, ∞) and range R. For the most part, we only focus on logarithms with a base larger than 1 (i.e., a > 1)
as these are the most important.

2.5. Logarithms

61

Notice that every logarithm passes through the point (1, 0) in the same way that every exponential function
passes through the point (0, 1).
Some properties of logarithms are as follows.
Logarithm Properties
Let A, B be positive numbers and b > 0 (b 6= 1) be a base.
• logb (AB) = logb A + logb B,
 
A
• logb
= logb A − logb B,
B
• logb (An ) = n logb A, where n is any real number.

Example 2.18: Compute Lorarithms

To compute log2 (24) − log2 (3) we can do the following:
 
24
log2 (24) − log2 (3) = log2
= log2 (8) = 3,
3
since 23 = 8.

The Natural Logarithm
As mentioned earlier for exponential functions, the number e ≈ 2.71828 . . . is the most convenient base to
use in Calculus. For this reason we give the logarithm with base e a special name: the natural logarithm.
We also give it special notation:
loge x = ln x.
You may pronounce ln as either: “el - en”, “lawn”, or refer to it as “natural log”. The above properties
of logarithms also apply to the natural logarithm.
Often we need to turn a logarithm (in a different base) into a natural logarithm. This gives rise to the
change of base formula.

x + 2 = ln 6 + 2x
x = 2 − ln 6

2.6 Inverse Trigonometric Functions
The trigonometric functions frequently arise in problems, and often it is necessary to invert the functions,
for example, to find an angle with a specified sine. Of course, there are many angles with the same sine,
so the sine function doesn’t actually have an inverse that reliably “undoes” the sine function. If you know
that sin x = 0.5, you can’t reverse this to discover x, that is, you can’t solve for x, as there are infinitely
many angles with sine 0.5. Nevertheless, it is useful to have something like an inverse to the sine, however
imperfect. The usual approach is to pick out some collection of angles that produce all possible values of
the sine exactly once. If we “discard” all other angles, the resulting function does have a proper inverse.
The sine takes on all values between −1 and 1 exactly once on the interval [−π /2, π /2].

If we truncate the sine, keeping only the interval [−π /2, π /2], then this truncated sine has an inverse
function. We call this the inverse sine or the arcsine, and write it in one of two common notation: y =

64

Functions

arcsin(x), or y = sin−1 (x).

√
Recall that a function and its inverse undo each other in either order, for example, ( 3 x)3 = x and
√
3
x3 = x. This does not work with the sine and the “inverse sine” because the inverse sine is the inverse
of the truncated sine function, not the real sine function. It is true that sin(arcsin(x)) = x, that is, the
sine undoes the arcsine. It is not true that the arcsine undoes the sine, for example, sin(5π /6) = 1/2 and
arcsin(1/2) = π /6, so doing first the sine then the arcsine does not get us back where we started. This is
because 5π /6 is not in the domain of the truncated sine. If we start with an angle between −π /2 and π /2
then the arcsine does reverse the sine: sin(π /6) = 1/2 and arcsin(1/2) = π /6.
Example 2.22: Arcsine of Common Values

Compute sin−1 (0), sin−1 (1) and sin−1 (−1).
Solution. These come directly from the graph of y = arcsin x:
sin−1 (0) = 0

sin−1 (1) =

π
2

sin−1 (−1) = −

π

♣

We can do something similar for the cosine function. As with the sine, we must first truncate the cosine
so that it can be inverted, in particular, we use the interval [0, π ].

2.6. Inverse Trigonometric Functions

65

Note that the truncated cosine uses a different interval than the truncated sine, so that if y = arccos(x) we
know that 0 ≤ y ≤ π .

Example 2.23: Arccosine of Common Values

Compute cos−1 (0), cos−1 (1) and cos−1 (−1).
Solution. These come directly from the graph of y = arccos x:
cos−1 (0) =

π
2

cos−1 (1) = 0

cos−1 (−1) = π
♣

Finally we look at the tangent; the other trigonometric functions also have “partial inverses” but
the sine, cosine and tangent are enough for most purposes. The truncated tangent uses an interval of
(−π /2, π /2).

66

Functions

Reflecting the truncated tangent in the line y = x gives the arctangent function.

Example 2.24: Arctangent of Common Values

Compute tan−1 (0). What value does tan−1 x approach as x gets larger and larger? What value does
tan−1 x approach as x gets large (and negative)?
Solution. These come directly from the graph of y = arctan x. In particular, tan−1 (0) = 0. As x gets larger
and larger, tan−1 x approaches a value of π2 , whereas, as x gets large but negative, tan−1 x approaches a
value of − π2 .
♣
The cancellation rules are tricky since we restricted the domains of the trigonometric functions in order
to obtain inverse trig functions:
Cancellation Rules
sin(sin−1 x) = x, x ∈ [−1, 1]
cos(cos−1 x) = x, x ∈ [−1, 1]
tan(tan−1 x) = x, x ∈ (−∞, ∞)

Example 2.25: Arcsine of 1/2

Find sin−1 (1/2).
Solution. Since sin−1 (x) outputs values in [−π /2, π /2], the answer must be in this interval. Let θ =
sin−1 (1/2). We need to compute θ . Take the sine of both sides to get sin θ = sin(sin−1 (1/2)) = 1/2 by
the cancellation rule. There are many
 angles θ that work, but we want the one in the interval [−π /2, π /2].

Example 2.26: Arccosine and the Cancellation Rule

Compute cos−1 (cos(0)), cos−1 (cos(π )), cos−1 (cos(2π )), cos−1 (cos(3π )).
Solution. Since cos−1 (x) outputs values in [0, π ], the answers must be in this interval. The first two we
can cancel using the cancellation rules:
cos−1 (cos(0)) = 0

and

cos−1 (cos(π )) = π .

The third one we cannot cancel since 2π ∈
/ [0, π ]:
cos−1 (cos(2π )) is NOT equal to 2π .
But we know that cosine is a 2π -periodic function, so cos(2π ) = cos(0):
cos−1 (cos(2π )) = cos−1 (cos(0)) = 0
Similarly with the fourth one, we can NOT cancel yet since 3π ∈
/ [0, π ]. Using cos(3π ) = cos(3π − 2π ) =
cos(π ):
cos−1 (cos(3π )) = cos−1 (cos(π )) = π .

Rewrite the expression cos(sin−1 x) without trig functions. Note that the domain of this function is

2.7 Hyperbolic Functions
The hyperbolic functions appear with some frequency in applications, and are quite similar in many respects to the trigonometric functions. This is a bit surprising given our initial definitions.

2.7. Hyperbolic Functions

Definition 2.29: Hyperbolic Sine and Cosine

The hyperbolic cosine is the function
cosh x =

ex + e−x
,
2

sinh x =

ex − e−x

and the hyperbolic sine is the function

Notice that cosh is even (that is, cosh(−x) = cosh(x)) while sinh is odd (sinh(−x) = − sinh(x)), and
cosh x + sinh x = ex . Also, for all x, cosh x > 0, while sinh x = 0 if and only if ex − e−x = 0, which is true
precisely when x = 0.
Theorem 2.30: Range of Hyperbolic Cosine

The range of cosh x is [1, ∞).
Proof. Let y = cosh x. We solve for x:

From the last equation, we see y2 ≥ 1, and since y ≥ 0, it follows that y ≥ 1.
p
p
Now suppose y ≥ 1, so y ± y2 − 1 > 0. Then x = ln(y ± y2 − 1) is a real number, and y = cosh x,
so y is in the range of cosh(x).

This immediately gives two additional identities:
1 − tanh2 x = sech2 x

and

coth2 x − 1 = csch2 x.

The identity of the theorem also helps to provide a geometric motivation. Recall that the graph of
x − y2 = 1 is a hyperbola with asymptotes x = ±y whose x-intercepts
are ±1.
p If (x, y) is a point on the
p
2
right half of the hyperbola, and if we let x = cosht, then y = ± x − 1 = ± cosh2 x − 1 = ± sinht. So
for some suitable t, cosht and sinht are the coordinates of a typical point on the hyperbola. In fact, it turns
out that t is twice the area shown in the first graph of figure 2.4. Even this is analogous to trigonometry;
cost and sint are the coordinates of a typical point on the unit circle, and t is twice the area shown in the
second graph of Figure 2.4.
2

Figure 2.4: Geometric definitions. Here, t is twice the shaded area in each figure.
Since cosh x > 0, sinh x is increasing and hence one-to-one, so sinh x has an inverse, arcsinhx. Also,
sinh x > 0 when x > 0, so cosh x is injective on [0, ∞) and has a (partial) inverse, arccoshx. The other
hyperbolic functions have inverses as well, though arcsechx is only a partial inverse.

3.1 The Limit
The value a function f approaches as its input x approaches some value is said to be the limit of f . Limits
are essential to the study of calculus and, as we will see, are used in defining continuity, derivatives, and
integrals.
Consider the function
x2 − 1
f (x) =
.
x−1

Notice that x = 1 does not belong to the domain of f (x). Regardless, we would like to know how f (x)
behaves close to the point x = 1. We start with a table of values:
f (x)
1.5
1.9
1.99
2.01
2.1
2.5

x
0.5
0.9
0.99
1.01
1.1
1.5

It appears that for values of x close to 1 we have that f (x) is close to 2. In fact, we can make the values
of f (x) as close to 2 as we like by taking x sufficiently close to 1. We express this by saying the limit of
the function f (x) as x approaches 1 is equal to 2 and use the notation:
lim f (x) = 2.

x→1

Definition 3.1: Limit (Useable Definition)

In general, we will write
lim f (x) = L,

x→a

if we can make the values of f (x) arbitrarily close to L by taking x to be sufficiently close to a (on
either side of a) but not equal to a.
We read the expression limx→a f (x) = L as “the limit of f (x) as x approaches a is equal to L". When
evaluating a limit, you are essentially answering the following question: What number does the function
75

76

Limits

approach while x gets closer and closer to a (but not equal to a)? The phrase but not equal to a in the
definition of a limit means that when finding the limit of f (x) as x approaches a we never actually consider
x = a. In fact, as we just saw in the example above, a may not even belong to the domain of f . All that
matters for limits is what happens to f close to a, not necessarily what happens to f at a.

One-sided limits
Consider the following piecewise defined function:
y

x

Observe from the graph that as x gets closer and closer to 1 from the left, then f (x) approaches +1.
Similarly, as x gets closer and closer 1 from the right, then f (x) approaches +2. We use the following
notation to indicate this:
lim f (x) = 1
and
lim f (x) = 2.
x→1+

x→1−

The symbol x → 1− means that we only consider values of x sufficiently close to 1 which are less than 1.
Similarly, the symbol x → 1+ means that we only consider values of x sufficiently close to 1 which are
greater than 1.
Definition 3.2: Left and Right-Hand Limit (Useable Definition)

In general, we will write
lim f (x) = L,

x→a−

if we can make the values of f (x) arbitrarily close to L by taking x to be sufficiently close to a and
x less than a. This is called the left-hand limit of f (x) as x approaches a. Similarly, we write
lim f (x) = L,

x→a+

if we can make the values of f (x) arbitrarily close to L by taking x to be sufficiently close to a and
x greater than a. This is called the right-hand limit of f (x) as x approaches a.
We note the following fact:
lim f (x) = L

x→a

if and only if

lim f (x) = L

x→a−

and

lim f (x) = L.

x→a+

3.2 Precise Definition of a Limit
The definiton given for a limit previously is more of a working definition. In this section we pursue the
actual, official definition of a limit.
Definition 3.3: Precise Definition of Limit

Suppose f is a function. We say that lim f (x) = L if for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 so that whenever
x→a

0 < |x − a| < δ , | f (x) − L| < ε.
The ε and δ here play exactly the role they did in the preceding discussion. The definition says, in a
very precise way, that f (x) can be made as close as desired to L (that’s the | f (x) − L| < ε part) by making
x close enough to a (the 0 < |x − a| < δ part). Note that we specifically make no mention of what must
happen if x = a, that is, if |x − a| = 0. This is because in the cases we are most interested in, substituting
a for x doesn’t make sense.
Make sure you are not confused by the names of important quantities. The generic definition talks
about f (x), but the function and the variable might have other names. The x was the variable of the
original function; when we were trying to compute a slope or a velocity, x was essentially a fixed quantity,
telling us at what point we wanted the slope. In the velocity problem, it was literally a fixed quantity, as we
focused on the time t = 2. The quantity a of the definition in all the examples was zero: we were always
interested in what happened as ∆x became very close to zero.
Armed with a precise definition, we can now prove that certain quantities behave in a particular way.
The bad news is that even proofs for simple quantities can be quite tedious and complicated. The good

78

Limits

news is that we rarely need to do such proofs, because most expressions act the way you would expect,
and this can be proved once and for all.
Example 3.4: Epsilon Delta

Let’s show carefully that lim x + 4 = 6.
x→2

Solution. This is not something we “need” to prove, since it is “obviously” true. But if we couldn’t prove
it using our official definition there would be something very wrong with the definition.
As is often the case in mathematical proofs, it helps to work backwards. We want to end up showing
that under certain circumstances x + 4 is close to 6; precisely, we want to show that |x + 4 − 6| < ε , or
|x − 2| < ε . Under what circumstances? We want this to be true whenever 0 < |x − 2| < δ . So the question
becomes: can we choose a value for δ that guarantees that 0 < |x − 2| < δ implies |x − 2| < ε ? Of course:
no matter what ε is, δ = ε works.
♣
So it turns out to be very easy to prove something “obvious,” which is nice. It doesn’t take long before
things get trickier, however.
Example 3.5: Epsilon Delta

It seems clear that lim x2 = 4. Let’s try to prove it.
x→2

Solution. We will want to be able to show that |x2 − 4| < ε whenever 0 < |x − 2| < δ , by choosing δ
carefully. Is there any connection between |x − 2| and |x2 − 4|? Yes, and it’s not hard to spot, but it is not
so simple as the previous example. We can write |x2 −4| = |(x+2)(x−2)|. Now when |x−2| is small, part
of |(x + 2)(x − 2)| is small, namely (x − 2). What about (x + 2)? If x is close to 2, (x + 2) certainly can’t be
too big, but we need to somehow be precise about it. Let’s recall the “game” version of what is going on
here. You get to pick an ε and I have to pick a δ that makes things work out. Presumably it is the really tiny
values of ε I need to worry about, but I have to be prepared for anything, even an apparently “bad” move
like ε = 1000. I expect that ε is going to be small, and that the corresponding δ will be small, certainly less
than 1. If δ ≤ 1 then |x + 2| < 5 when |x − 2| < δ (because if x is within 1 or 2, then x is between 1 and 3
and x+2 is between 3 and 5). So then I’d be trying to show that |(x+2)(x−2)| < 5|x−2| < ε . So now how
can I pick δ so that |x − 2| < δ implies 5|x − 2| < ε ? This is easy: use δ = ε /5, so 5|x − 2| < 5(ε /5) = ε .
But what if the ε you choose is not small? If you choose ε = 1000, should I pick δ = 200? No, to keep
things “sane” I will never pick a δ bigger than 1. Here’s the final “game strategy”: when you pick a
value for ε , I will pick δ = ε /5 or δ = 1, whichever is smaller. Now when |x − 2| < δ , I know both that
|x + 2| < 5 and that |x − 2| < ε /5. Thus |(x + 2)(x − 2)| < 5(ε /5) = ε .
This has been a long discussion, but most of it was explanation and scratch work. If this were written
down as a proof, it would be quite short, like this:
Proof that lim x2 = 4. Given any ε , pick δ = ε /5 or δ = 1, whichever is smaller. Then when |x−2| < δ ,
x→2

|x + 2| < 5 and |x − 2| < ε /5. Hence |x2 − 4| = |(x + 2)(x − 2)| < 5(ε /5) = ε .

♣

It probably seems obvious that lim x2 = 4, and it is worth examining more closely why it seems obx→2

vious. If we write x2 = x · x, and ask what happens when x approaches 2, we might say something like,

3.2. Precise Definition of a Limit

79

“Well, the first x approaches 2, and the second x approaches 2, so the product must approach 2 · 2.” In fact
this is pretty much right on the money, except for that word “must.” Is it really true that if x approaches a
and y approaches b then xy approaches ab? It is, but it is not really obvious, since x and y might be quite
complicated. The good news is that we can see that this is true once and for all, and then we don’t have to
worry about it ever again. When we say that x might be “complicated” we really mean that in practice it
might be a function. Here is then what we want to know:
Theorem 3.6: Limit Product

Suppose lim f (x) = L and lim g(x) = M . Then lim f (x)g(x) = LM .
x→a

x→a

x→a

Proof. We must use the Precise Definition of a Limit to prove the Produce Law for Limits. So given any ε
we need to find a δ so that 0 < |x − a| < δ implies | f (x)g(x) − LM| < ε . What do we have to work with?
We know that we can make f (x) close to L and g(x) close to M, and we have to somehow connect these
facts to make f (x)g(x) close to LM.
We use, as is often the case, a little algebraic trick:
| f (x)g(x) − LM| = | f (x)g(x) − f (x)M + f (x)M − LM|
= | f (x)(g(x) − M) + ( f (x) − L)M|
≤ | f (x)(g(x) − M)| + |( f (x) − L)M|
= | f (x)||g(x) − M| + | f (x) − L||M|.
This is all straightforward except perhaps for the “≤”. That is an example of the triangle inequality,
which says that if a and b are any real numbers then |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|. If you look at a few examples,
using positive and negative numbers in various combinations for a and b, you should quickly understand
why this is true. We will not prove it formally.
Suppose ε > 0. Since lim f (x) = L, there is a value δ1 such that 0 < |x − a| < δ1 implies | f (x) − L| <
x→a
ε
. This means that 0 < |x − a| < δ1 implies | f (x) − L||M| < | f (x) − L|(1 + |M|) < ε /2.
2(1 + |M|)
Now we focus our attention on the other term in the inequality, | f (x)||g(x) − M|. We can make |g(x) −
M| smaller than any fixed number by making x close enough to a; unfortunately, ε /(2 f (x)) is not a fixed
number, since x is a variable. Here we need another little trick, just like the one we used in analyzing
x2 . We can find a δ2 so that |x − a| < δ2 implies that | f (x) − L| < 1, meaning that L − 1 < f (x) < L + 1.
This means that | f (x)| < N, where N is either |L − 1| or |L + 1|, depending on whether L is negative or
positive. The important point is that N doesn’t depend on x. Finally, we know that there is a δ3 so that
0 < |x − a| < δ3 implies |g(x) − M| < ε /(2N). Let δ be the smallest of δ1 , δ2 , and δ3 . Then |x − a| < δ
implies that | f (x) − L| < ε /(2(1 + |M|)), | f (x)| < N, and |g(x) − M| < ε /(2N). Then
| f (x)g(x) − LM| ≤ | f (x)||g(x) − M| + | f (x) − L||M|

Limits
The concept of a one-sided limit can also be made precise.
Definition 3.7: One-sided Limit

Suppose that f (x) is a function. We say that lim f (x) = L if for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 so
x→a−

that whenever 0 < a − x < δ , | f (x) − L| < ε. We say that lim+ f (x) = L if for every ε > 0 there is a

δ > 0 so that whenever 0 < x − a < δ , | f (x) − L| < ε.

3.3 Computing Limits: Graphically
In this section we look at an example to illustrate the concept of a limit graphically.
The graph of a function f (x) is shown below. We will analyze the behaviour of f (x) around x = −5,
x = −2, x = −1 and x = 0, and x = 4.
y

x

Observe that f (x) is indeed a function (it passes the vertical line test). We now analyze the function at
each point separately.

3.3. Computing Limits: Graphically

81

x = −5 : Observe that at x = −5 there is no closed circle, thus f (−5) is undefined. From the graph we
see that as x gets closer and closer to −5 from the left, then f (x) approaches 2, so
lim f (x) = 2.

x→−5−

Similarly, as x gets closer and closer −5 from the right, then f (x) approaches −3, so
lim f (x) = −3.

x→−5+

As the right-hand limit and left-hand limit are not equal at −5, we know that
lim f (x)

x→−5

does not exist.

x = −2 : Observe that at x = −2 there is a closed circle at 0, thus f (−2) = 0. From the graph we see
that as x gets closer and closer to −2 from the left, then f (x) approaches 3.5, so
lim f (x) = 3.5.

x→−2−

Similarly, as x gets closer and closer −2 from the right, then f (x) again approaches 3.5, so
lim f (x) = 3.5.

x→−2+

As the right-hand limit and left-hand limit are both equal to 3.5, we know that
lim f (x) = 3.5.

x→−2

Do not be concerned that the limit does not equal 0. This is a discontinuity, which is completely valid,
and will be discussed in a later section.
We leave it to the reader to analyze the behaviour of f (x) for x close to −1 and 0.
Summarizing, we have:

3.4 Computing Limits: Algebraically
Properties of limits
We begin by deriving a handful of theorems to give us the tools to compute many limits without explicitly
working with the precise definition of a limit.

Roughly speaking, these rules say that to compute the limit of an algebraic expression, it is enough
to compute the limits of the “innermost bits” and then combine these limits. This often means that it is
possible to simply plug in a value for the variable, since lim x = a.

It is worth commenting on the trivial limit lim 5. From one point of view this might seem meaningless,
x→1

as the number 5 can’t “approach” any value, since it is simply a fixed number. However, 5 can, and

84

Limits

should, be interpreted here as the function that has value 5 everywhere, f (x) = 5, with graph a horizontal
line. From this point of view it makes sense to ask what happens to the values of the function (height of
the graph) as x approaches 1.
We’re primarily interested in limits that aren’t so easy, namely, limits in which a denominator approaches zero. There are a handful of algebraic tricks that work on many of these limits.
Example 3.10: Zero Denominator
x2 + 2x − 3
.
x→1
x−1

Solution. We can’t simply plug in x = 1 because that makes the denominator zero. However:

♣
The technique used to solve the previous example can be referred to as factor and cancel. Its validity
comes from the fact that we are allowed to cancel x − 1 from the numerator and denominator. Remember
in Calculus that we have to make sure we don’t cancel zeros, so we require x − 1 6= 0 in order to cancel
it. But looking back at the definition of a limit using x → 1, the key point for this example is that we are
taking values of x close to 1 but not equal to 1. This is exactly what we wanted (x 6= 1) in order to cancel
this common factor.
While Theorem 3.8 is very helpful, we need a bit more to work easily with limits. Since the theorem
applies when some limits are already known, we need to know the behavior of some functions
that cannot
√
themselves be constructed from the simple arithmetic operations of the theorem, such as x. Also, there is
one other extraordinarily useful way to put functions together: composition. If f (x) and g(x)√are functions,
we can form two functions
and g( f (x)). For example, if f (x) = x and g(x) =
p by composition: f (g(x))
√ 2
2
2
x + 5, then f (g(x)) = x + 5 and g( f (x)) = ( x) + 5 = x + 5. Here is a companion to Theorem 3.8
for composition:
Theorem 3.11: Limit of Composition

Suppose that lim g(x) = L and lim f (x) = f (L). Then
x→a

x→L

lim f (g(x)) = f (L).

x→a

Note the special form of the condition on f : it is not enough to know that lim f (x) = M, though it is a
x→L

bit tricky to see why. We have included an example in the exercise section to illustrate this tricky point for
those who are interested. Many of the most familiar functions do have this property, and this theorem can
therefore be applied. For example:

3.5 Infinite Limits and Limits at Infinity
We occasionally want to know what happens to some quantity when a variable gets very large or “goes to
infinity”.
Example 3.15: Limit at Infinity

What happens to the function cos(1/x) as x goes to infinity? It seems clear that as x gets larger
and larger, 1/x gets closer and closer to zero, so cos(1/x) should be getting closer and closer to
cos(0) = 1.
As with ordinary limits, this concept of “limit at infinity” can be made precise. Roughly, we want
lim f (x) = L to mean that we can make f (x) as close as we want to L by making x large enough.

x→∞

3.5. Infinite Limits and Limits at Infinity

87

Definition 3.16: Limit at Infinity (Formal Definition)

If f is a function, we say that lim f (x) = L if for every ε > 0 there is an N > 0 so that whenever
x→∞

x > N , | f (x) − L| < ε. We may similarly define lim f (x) = L.
x→−∞

We include this definition for completeness, but we will not explore it in detail. Suffice it to say that
such limits behave in much the same way that ordinary limits do; in particular there is a direct analog of
Theorem 3.8.
Example 3.17: Limit at Infinity
2x2 − 3x + 7
.
x→∞ x2 + 47x + 1

Compute lim

Solution. As x goes to infinity both the numerator and denominator go to infinity. We divide the numerator
and denominator by x2 :

2x2 − 3x + 7
x x .
lim
= lim
47 1
x→∞ x2 + 47x + 1
x→∞
1+ + 2
x
x
Now as x approaches infinity, all the quotients with some power of x in the denominator approach zero,
leaving 2 in the numerator and 1 in the denominator, so the limit again is 2.
♣
In the previous example, we divided by the highest power of x that occurs in the denominator in order
to evaluate the limit. We illustrate another technique similar to this.
Example 3.18: Limit at Infinity

Compute the following limit:
2x2 + 3
.
x→∞ 5x2 + x
lim

Solution. As x becomes large, both the numerator and denominator become large, so it isn’t clear what
happens to their ratio. The highest power of x in the denominator is x2 , therefore we will divide every term
in both the numerator and denominator by x2 as follows:
2x2 + 3
2 + 3/x2
lim
= lim
.
x→∞ 5x2 + x
x→∞ 5 + 1/x

A shortcut technique is to analyze only the leading terms of the numerator and denominator. A leading
term is a term that has the highest power of x. If there are multiple terms with the same exponent, you
must include all of them.
Top: The leading term is 2x2 .
Bottom: The leading term is 5x2 .
Now only looking at leading terms and ignoring the other terms we get:
2x2 + 3

♣
We next look at limits whose value is infinity (or minus infinity).
Definition 3.19: Infinite Limit (Useable Definition)

In general, we will write
lim f (x) = ∞

x→a

if we can make the value of f (x) arbitrarily large by taking x to be sufficiently close to a (on either
side of a) but not equal to a. Similarly, we will write
lim f (x) = −∞

x→a

if we can make the value of f (x) arbitrarily large and negative by taking x to be sufficiently close to
a (on either side of a) but not equal to a.
This definition can be modified for one-sided limits as well as limits with x → a replaced by x → ∞ or
x → −∞.
Example 3.20: Limit at Infinity

Compute the following limit: lim (x3 − x).
x→∞

Solution. One might be tempted to write:
lim x3 − lim x = ∞ − ∞,

x→∞

x→∞

however, we do not know what ∞ − ∞ is, as ∞ is not a real number and so cannot be treated like one. We
instead write:
lim (x3 − x) = lim x(x2 − 1).
x→∞

x→∞

x2 − 1

As x becomes arbitrarily large, then both x and
become arbitrarily large, and hence their product
2
x(x − 1) will also become arbitrarily large. Thus we see that
lim (x3 − x) = ∞.

x→∞

We can easily evaluate the following limits by observation:

3.5.1. Vertical Asymptotes
The line x = a is called a vertical asymptote of f (x) if at least one of the following is true:

x→a

lim f (x) = −∞

x→a

lim f (x) = ∞

Example 3.23: Vertical Asymptotes

Find the vertical asymptotes of f (x) =

2x
.
x−4

Solution. In the definition of vertical asymptotes we need a certain limit to be ±∞. Candidates would be
to consider values not in the domain of f (x), such as a = 4. As x approaches 4 but is larger than 4 then
x − 4 is a small positive number and 2x is close to 8, so the quotient 2x/(x − 4) is a large positive number.
Thus we see that
2x
= ∞.
lim
x→4+ x − 4
Thus, at least one of the conditions in the definition above is satisfied. Therefore x = 4 is a vertical
asymptote.
♣

3.5.2. Horizontal Asymptotes
The line y = L is a horizontal asymptote of f (x) if either
lim f (x) = L

x→∞

or

lim f (x) = L.

x→−∞

Example 3.24: Horizontal Asymptotes

Find the horizontal asymptotes of f (x) =

|x|
.
x

Solution. We must compute two infinite limits. First,
|x|
.
x→∞ x
lim

Notice that for x arbitrarily large that x > 0, so that |x| = x. In particular, for x in the interval (0, ∞) we
have
|x|
x
lim
= lim = 1.
x→∞ x
x→∞ x
Second, we must compute
|x|
.
lim
x→−∞ x
Notice that for x arbitrarily large negative that x < 0, so that |x| = −x. In particular, for x in the interval
(−∞, 0) we have
|x|
−x
lim
= lim
= −1.
x→−∞ x
x→−∞ x
Therefore there are two horizontal asymptotes, namely, y = 1 and y = −1.

3.5.3. Slant Asymptotes
Some functions may have slant (or oblique) asymptotes, which are neither vertical nor horizontal. If
lim [ f (x) − (mx + b)] = 0

x→∞

then the straight line y = mx + b is a slant asymptote to f (x). Visually, the vertical distance between f (x)
and y = mx + b is decreasing towards 0 and the curves do not intersect or cross at any point as x approaches
infinity. Similarly when x → −∞.
Example 3.25: Slant Asymptote in a Rational Function

Find the slant asymptotes of f (x) =

−3x2 + 4
.
x−1

Solution. Note that this function has no horizontal asymptotes since f (x) → −∞ as x → ∞ and f (x) → ∞
as x → −∞.
In rational functions, slant asymptotes occur when the degree in the numerator is one greater than in
the denominator. We use long division to rearrange the function:
−3x2 + 4
1
= −3x − 3 +
.
x−1
x−1

The part we’re interested in is the resulting polynomial −3x − 3. This is the line y = mx + b we were
seeking, where m = −3 and b = −3. Notice that
−3x2 + 4
1
− (−3x − 3) = lim
=0
x→∞ x − 1
x→∞ x − 1
lim

and

−3x2 + 4
1
− (−3x − 3) = lim
= 0.
x→−∞ x − 1
x→−∞ x − 1
Thus, y = −3x − 3 is a slant asymptote of f (x).
lim

♣

Although rational functions are the most common type of function we encounter with slant asymptotes,
there are other types of functions we can consider that present an interesting challenge.
Example 3.26: Slant Asymptote

Show that y = 2x + 4 is a slant asymptote of f (x) = 2x − 3x + 4.
Solution. This is because
lim [ f (x) − (2x + 4)] = lim (−3x ) = 0.

x→−∞

x→−∞

♣
We note that limx→∞ [ f (x)−(2x+4)] = limx→∞ (−3x ) = −∞. So, the vertical distance between y = f (x)
and the line y = 2x + 4 decreases toward 0 only when x → −∞ and not when x → ∞. The graph of f

92

Limits

approaches the slant asymptote y = 2x + 4 only at the far left and not at the far right. One might ask if
y = f (x) approaches a slant asymptote when x → ∞. The answer turns out to be no, but we will need to
know something about the relative growth rates of the exponential functions and linear functions in order
to prove this. Specifically, one can prove that when the base is greater than 1 the exponential functions
grows faster than any power function as x → ∞. This can be phrased like this: For any a > 1 and any n > 0,
xn
ax
=
∞
and
lim
= 0.
x→∞ ax
x→∞ xn
lim

These facts are most easily proved with the aim of something called the L’Hôpital’s Rule.

3.5.4. End Behaviour and Comparative Growth Rates
Let us now look at the last two subsections and go deeper. In the last two subsections we looked at
horizontal and slant asymptotes. Both are special cases of the end behaviour of functions, and both concern
situations where the graph of a function approaches a straight line as x → ∞ or −∞. But not all functions
have this kind of end behviour. For example, f (x) = x2 and f (x) = x3 do not approach a straight line as
x → ∞ or −∞. The best we can say with the notion of limit developed at this stage are that
lim x2 = ∞, lim x2 = ∞,

x→∞

x→−∞

3

= ∞, lim x3 = −∞.

lim x

x→∞

x→−∞

Similarly, we can describe the end behaviour of transcendental functions such as f (x) = ex using limits,
and in this case, the graph approaches a line as x → −∞ but not as x → ∞.
lim ex = 0, lim ex = ∞.
x→∞

x→−∞

People have found it useful to make a finer distinction between these end behaviours all thus far
captured by the symbols ∞ and −∞. Specifically, we will see that the above functions have different
growth rates at infinity. Some increases to infinty faster than others. Specifically,
Definition 3.27: Comparative Growth Rates

Suppose that f and g are two functions such that lim f (x) = ∞ and lim g (x) = ∞. We say that f (x)
x→∞

grows faster than g (x) as x → ∞ if the following holds:
f (x)
= ∞,
x→∞ g (x)
lim

or equivalently,
g (x)
= 0.
x→∞ f (x)
lim

Here are a few obvious examples:

Example 3.28:

Show that if m > n are two positive integers, then f (x) = xm grows faster than g(x) = xn as x → ∞.
Solution. Since m > n, m − n is a positive integer. Therefore,
f (x)

♣
Example 3.29:

Show that if m > n are two positive integers, then any monic polynomial Pm (x) of degree m grows
faster than any monic polynomial Pn (x) of degree n as x → ∞. [Recall that a polynomial is monic if
its leading coefficient is 1.]
Solution. By assumption, Pm (x) = xm + terms of degrees less than m = xm + am−1 xm−1 + . . ., and Pn (x) =
xn + terms of degrees less than n = xn + bn−1 xn−1 + . . .. Dividing the numerator and denominator by xn ,
we get

since the limit of the bracketed fraction is 1 and the limit of

Example 3.30:

Show that a polynomial grows exactly as fast as its highest degree term as x → ∞ or −∞. That is, if
P(x) is any polynomial and Q(x) is its highest degree term, then both limits
P(x)
P(x)
and lim

are finite and nonzero.
Solution. Suppose that P(x) = an xn + an−1 xn−1 + . . . + a1 x + a0 , where an 6= 0. Then the highest degree
term is Q (x) = an xn . So,

Let’s state a theorem we mentioned when we discussed the last example in the last subsection:

The easiest way to prove this is to use the L’Hôpital’s Rule, which we will introduce in a later chapter.
For now, one can plot and compare the graphs of an exponential function and a power function. Here is a

Notice also that as x → −∞, xn grows in size but ex does not. More specifically, xn → ∞ or −∞
according as n is even or odd, while ex → 0. So, it is meaningless to compare their “growth” rates,
although we can still calculate the limit
ex
lim n = 0.
x→−∞ x
Let’s see an application of our theorem.
Example 3.32:

Find the horizontal asymptote(s) of f (x) =

x3 + 2ex
.
ex − 4x2

Solution. To find horizontal asymptotes, we calculate the limits of f (x) as x → ∞ and x → −∞. For x → ∞,
we divide the numerator and the denominator by ex , and then we take limit to get

The denominator now approaches 0 − 4 = −4. The numerator has limit −∞. So, the quotient has limit ∞:

= ∞.

So, y = 2 is a horizontal asymptote. The function y = f (x) approaches the line y = 2 as x → ∞. And
this is the only horizontal asymptote, since the function y = f (x) does not approach any horizontal line as
x → −∞.
♣
Since the growth rate of a polynomial is the same as that of its leading term, the following is obvious:
Example 3.33:

If P(x) is any polynomial, then
P(x)
= 0.
x→∞ ex
lim

Also, if
√ r is any real number, then we can place it between two consecutive integers n and n + 1. For
example, 3 is between 1 and 2, e is between 2 and 3, and π is between 3 and 4. Then the following is
totally within our expectation:
Example 3.34:

Prove that if a > 1 is any basis and r > 0 is any exponent, then f (x) = ax grows faster than g(x) = xr
as x → ∞.
Solution. Let r be between consecutive integers n and n + 1. Then for all x > 1, xn ≤ xr ≤ xn+1 . Dividing
by ax , we get
xn

What about exponential functions with different bases? We recall from the graphs of the exponential
functions that for any base a > 1,
lim ax = ∞.
x→∞

So, the exponential functions with bases greater than 1 all grow to infinity as x → ∞. How do their
growth rates compare?

Another function that grows to infinity as x → ∞ is g(x) = ln x. Recall that the natural logarithmic
function is the inverse of the exponential function y = ex . Since ex grows very fast as x increases, we
should expect ln x to grow very slowly as x increases. The same applies to logarithmic functions with any
basis a > 1. This is the content of the next theorem.
Theorem 3.36:

Let r be any positive real number and a > 1. Then
(a) f (x) = xr grows faster than g(x) = ln x as x → ∞.
(b) f (x) = xr grows faster than g(x) = loga x as x → ∞.
Proof.
1. We use a change of variable. Letting t = ln x, then x = et . So, x → ∞ if and only if t → ∞, and
ln x

Notice that x = 0 is not in the domain of this function. Nevertheless, we can look at the limit as x approaches 0. From the graph we find that the limit is 1 (there is an open circle at x = 0 indicating 0 is
not in the domain). We just convinced you this limit formula holds true based on the graph, but how
does one attempt to prove this limit more formally? To do this we need to be quite clever, and to employ
some indirect reasoning. The indirect reasoning is embodied in a theorem, frequently called the squeeze
theorem.
Theorem 3.37: Squeeze Theorem

Suppose that g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ h(x) for all x close to a but not equal to a. If lim g(x) = L = lim h(x),
x→a

x→a

then lim f (x) = L.
x→a

This theorem can be proved using the official definition of limit. We won’t prove it here, but point out
that it is easy to understand and believe graphically. The condition says that f (x) is trapped between g(x)
below and h(x) above, and that at x = a, both g and h approach the same value. This means the situation
looks something like Figure 3.1.
For example, imagine the blue curve is f (x) = x2 sin(π /x), the upper (red) and lower (green) curves are
h(x) = x2 and g(x) = −x2 . Since the sine function is always between −1 and 1, −x2 ≤ x2 sin(π /x) ≤ x2 ,

3.6. A Trigonometric Limit

99

and it is easy to see that limx→0 −x2 = 0 = limx→0 x2 . It is not so easy to see directly (i.e. algebraically)
that limx→0 x2 sin(π /x) = 0, because the π /x prevents us from simply plugging in x = 0. The squeeze
theorem makes this “hard limit” as easy as the trivial limits involving x2 .

Figure 3.1: The squeeze theorem.
To compute lim (sin x)/x, we will find two simpler functions g and h so that g(x) ≤ (sin x)/x ≤ h(x),
x→0

and so that limx→0 g(x) = limx→0 h(x). Not too surprisingly, this will require some trigonometry and
geometry. Referring to figure 3.2, x is the measure of the angle in radians. Since the circle has radius 1,
the coordinates of point A are (cos x, sin x), and the area of the small triangle is (cos x sin x)/2. This triangle
is completely contained within the circular wedge-shaped region bordered by two lines and the circle from
(1, 0) to point A. Comparing the areas of the triangle and the wedge we see (cos x sin x)/2 ≤ x/2, since
the area of a circular region with angle θ and radius r is θ r2 /2. With a little algebra this turns into
(sin x)/x ≤ 1/ cos x, giving us the h we seek.

Figure 3.2: Visualizing sin x/x.
To find g, we note that the circular wedge is completely contained inside the larger triangle. The height
of the triangle, from (1, 0) to point B, is tan x, so comparing areas we get x/2 ≤ (tan x)/2 = sin x/(2 cos x).
With a little algebra this becomes cos x ≤ (sin x)/x. So now we have

3.7 Continuity
The graph shown in Figure 3.3(a) represents a continuous function. Geometrically, this is because there
are no jumps in the graphs. That is, if you pick a point on the graph and approach it from the left and right,

3.7. Continuity

103

the values of the function approach the value of the function at that point. For example, we can see that
this is not true for function values near x = 1 on the graph in Figure 3.3(b) which is not continuous at that
location.

Definition 3.42: Continuous at a Point

A function f is continuous at a point a if
lim f (x) = f (a).

x→a

Some readers may prefer to think of continuity at a point as a three part definition. That is, a function
f (x) is continuous at x = a if the following three conditions hold:
(i) f (a) is defined (that is, a belongs to the domain of f ),
(ii) lim f (x) exists (that is, left-hand limit = right-hand limit),
x→a

(iii) lim f (x) = f (a) (that is, the numbers from (i) and (ii) are equal).
x→a

The figures below show graphical examples of functions where either (i), (ii) or (iii) can fail to hold.

104

Limits

On the other hand, if f is defined on an open interval containing a, except perhaps at a, we can say
that f is discontinuous at a if f is not continuous at a.
Graphically, you can think of continuity as being able to draw your function without having to lift your
pencil off the paper. If your pencil has to jump off the page to continue drawing the function, then the
function is not continuous at that point. This is illustrated in Figure 3.3(b) where if we tried to draw the
function (from left to right) we need to lift our pencil off the page once we reach the point x = 1 in order
to be able to continue drawing the function.

Definition 3.43: Continuity on an Open Interval

A function f is continuous on an open interval (a, b) if it is continuous at every point in the
interval.
Furthermore, a function is everywhere continuous if it is continuous on the entire real number line
(−∞, ∞)..
Recall the function graphed in a previous section as shown in Figure 3.4.
y

x

Figure 3.4: A function with discontinuities at x = −5, x = −2, x = −1 and x = 4.
We can draw this function without lifting our pencil except at the points x = −5, x = −2, x = −1, and
x = 4. Thus, f (x) is continuous at every real number except at these four numbers. At x = −5, x = −2,
x = −1, and x = 4, the function f (x) is discontinuous.
At x = −2 we have a removable discontinuity because we could remove this discontinuity simply by
redefining f (−2) to be 3.5. At x = −5 and x = −1 we have jump discontinuities because the function
jumps from one value to another. From the right of x = 4, we have an infinite discontinuity because the
function goes off to infinity.
Formally, we say f (x) has a removable discontinuity at x = a if limx→a f (x) exists but is not equal to
f (a). Note that we do not require f (a) to be defined in this case, that is, a need not belong to the domain
of f (x).

Solution. In order to be continuous at 2 we require
lim f (x) = f (2)

x→2

to hold. We use the three part definition listed previously to check this.
1. First, f (2) = c, and c is some real number. Thus, f (2) is defined.
2. Now, we must evaluate the limit. Rather than computing both one-sided limits, we just compute the
2 −x−2
limit directly. For x close to 2 (but not equal to 2) we can replace f (x) with x x−2
to get:
x2 − x − 2
(x − 2)(x + 1)
= lim
= lim (x + 1) = 3.
x→2
x→2
x→2
x−2
x−2

lim f (x) = lim

x→2

Therefore the limit exists and equals 3.
3. Finally, for f to be continuous at 2, we need that the numbers in the first two items to be equal.
Therefore, we require c = 3. Thus, when c = 3, f (x) is continuous at 2, for any other value of c, f (x) is
discontinuous at 2.
♣
For continuity on a closed interval, we consider the one-sided limits of a function. Recall that x → a−
means x approaches a from values less than a.

Definition 3.45: Continuous from the Right and from the Left

A function f is left continuous at a point a if
lim f (x) = f (a)

x→a−

and right continuous at a point a if
lim f (x) = f (a).

x→a+

If a function f is continuous at a, then it is both left and right continuous at a.
The above definition regarding left (or right) continuous functions is illustrated with the following
figure:

One-sided limits allows us to extend the definition of continuity to closed intervals. The following
definition means a function is continuous on a closed interval if it is continuous in the interior of the
interval and possesses the appropriate one-sided continuity at the endpoints of the interval.
Definition 3.46: Continuity on a Closed Interval

A function f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] if:
(i) it is continuous on the open interval (a, b);
(ii) it is left continuous at point a:
lim f (x) = f (a);

x→a−

and
(iii) it is right continuous at point b:
lim f (x) = f (b).

x→b+

This definition can be extended to continuity on half-open intervals such as (a, b] and [a, b), and unbounded intervals.

√
The function f (x) = x is continuous on the (closed) interval [0, ∞).
√
The function f (x) = 4 − x is continuous on the (closed) interval (−∞, 4].
The continuity of functions is preserved under the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division (in the case that the function in the denominator is nonzero).
Theorem 3.48: Operations of Continuous Functions

If f and g are continous at a, and c is a constant, then the following functions are also continuous at
a:
(i) f ± g;

(iii) f g;

(ii) c f ;

(iv) f /g (provided g(a) 6= 0).

Below we list some common functions that are known to be continuous on every interval inside their
domains.
Example 3.49: Common Types of Continuous Functions

• Polynomials (for all x), e.g., y = mx + b, y = ax2 + bx + c.
• Rational functions (except at points x which gives division by zero).
√
• Root functions n x (for all x if n is odd, and for x ≥ 0 if n is even).
• Trigonometric functions
• Inverse trigonometric functions
• Exponential funtions
• Logarithmic functions
For rational functions with removable discontinuities as a result of a zero, we can define a new function
filling in these gaps to create a piecewise function that is continuous everywhere.
Continuous functions are where the direct substitution property hold. This fact can often be used to
compute the limit of a continuous function.

Continuity is also preserved under the composition of functions.
Theorem 3.51: Continuity of Function Composition

If g is continuous at a and f is continuous at g(a), then the composition function f ◦ g is continuous
at a.

Example 3.52: Continuity with Composition of Functions

Determine where the following functions is continuous:
(a) h(x) = cos(x2 )
(b) H(x) = ln(1 + sin(x))
Solution.
(a) The functions that make up the composition h(x) = f (g(x)) are g(x) = x2 and f (x) = cos(x). The
function g is continuous on R since it is a polynomial, and f is also continuous everywhere. Therefore,
h(x) = ( f ◦ g)(x) is continuous on R by Theorem 3.51.
(b) We know from Example 3.49 that f (x) = ln x is continuous and g(x) = 1 + sin x are continuous. Thus
by Theorem 3.51, H(x) = f (g(x)) is continuous wherever it is defined. Now ln(1 + sin x) is defined
when 1 + sin x > 0. Recall that −1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1, so 1 + sin x > 0 except when sin x = −1, which happens
when x = ±3π /2, ±7π /2, . . .. Therefore, H has discontinuities when x = 3π n/2, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . and is
continuous on the intervals between these values.

Intermediate Value Theorem
Whether or not an equation has a solution is an important question in mathematics. Consider the following
two questions:

110

Limits

Example 3.53: Motivation for the Intermediate Value Theorem

1. Does ex + x2 = 0 have a solution?
2. Does ex + x = 0 have a solution?
Solution.
1. The first question is easy to answer since for any exponential function we know that ax > 0, and
we also know that whenever you square a number you get a nonnegative answer: x2 ≥ 0. Hence,
ex + x2 > 0, and thus, is never equal to zero. Therefore, the first equation has no solution.
2. For the second question, it is difficult to see if ex + x = 0 has a solution. If we tried to solve for x,
we would run into problems. Let’s make a table of values to see what kind of values we get (recall
that e ≈ 2.7183):
x
ex + x
−2
−2 e − 2 ≈ −1.9
−1 e−1 − 1 ≈ −0.6
0
e0 + 0 = 1
1
e + 1 ≈ 3.7
Sketching this gives:

y

(0, 1)

x

(‐2, ‐1.9)

Let f (x) = ex + x. Notice that if we choose a = −1 and b = 0 then we have f (a) < 0 and f (b) > 0.
A point where the function f (x) crosses the x-axis gives a solution to ex + x = 0. Since f (x) = ex + x
is continuous (both ex and x are continuous), then the function must cross the x-axis somewhere
between −1 and 0:
y

jump over x‐axis

Therefore, our equation has a solution.

3.7. Continuity

111

Note that by looking at smaller and smaller intervals (a, b) with f (a) < 0 and f (b) > 0, we can
get a better and better approximation for a solution to ex + x = 0. For example, taking the interval
(−0.4, −0.6) gives f (−0.4) < 0 and f (−0.6) > 0, thus, there is a solution to f (x) = 0 between −0.4
and −0.6. It turns out that the solution to ex + x = 0 is x ≈ −0.56714.
♣
We now generalize the argument used in the previous example. In that example we had a continuous
function that went from negative to positive and hence, had to cross the x-axis at some point. In fact, we
don’t need to use the x-axis, any line y = N will work so long as the function is continuous and below the
line y = N at some point and above the line y = N at another point. This is known as the Intermediate
Values Theorem and it is formally stated as follows:
Theorem 3.54: Intermediate Value Theorem

If f is continuous on the interval [a, b] and N is between f (a) and f (b), where f (a) 6= f (b), then
there is a number c in (a, b) such that f (c) = N .
The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that if f (x) is continuous and f (a) < N < f (b), the line
y = N intersects the function at some point x = c. Such a number c is between a and b and has the property
that f (c) = N (see Figure 3.5(a)). We can also think of the theorem as saying if we draw the line y = N
between the lines y = f (a) and y = f (b), then the function cannot jump over the line y = N. On the other
hand, if f (x) is not continuous, then the theorem may not hold. See Figure 3.5(b) where there is no number
c in (a, b) such that f (c) = N. Finally, we remark that there may be multiple choices for c (i.e., lots of
numbers between a and b with y-coordinate N). See Figure 3.5(c) for such an example.

The Intermediate Value Theorem is most frequently used for N = 0.

√
√
Solution. Let f (x) = 3 x+x−1, N = 0, a = 0, and b = 8. Since 3 x, x and −1 are continuous on R, and the
sum of continuous functions is again continuous, we√
have that f (x) is continuous on R, thus
in particular,
√

f (x) is continuous on [0, 8]. We have f (a) = f (0) = 0 + 0 − 1 = −1 and f (b) = f (8) = 8 + 8 − 1 = 9.

112

Limits

Thus N = 0 lies between f (a) = −1 and f (b) = 9, so the conditions of the Intermediate Value
Theorem are
√
3
satisfied. So, there exists a number c in (0, 8) such that f (c) = 0. This means that c satisfies c+c−1 = 0,
in otherwords, is a solution for the equation given.
√
Alternatively we can let f (x) = 3 x + x, N = 1, a = 0 and b = 8. Then as before f (x) is the sum of two
continuous functions,√so is also continuous everywhere,
√ in particular, continuous on the interval [0, 8]. We
have f (a) = f (0) = 3 0 + 0 = 0 and f (b) = f (8) = 3 8 + 8 = 10. Thus N = 1 lies between f (a) = 0 and
f (b) = 10, so the conditions of the Intermediate Value Theorem
are satisfied. So, there exists a number
√
3
c in (0, 8) such that f (c) = 1. This means that c satisfies c + c = 1, in otherwords, is a solution for the
equation given.

Example 3.56: Roots of Function

Explain why the function f = x3 + 3x2 + x − 2 has a root between 0 and 1.
Solution. By theorem 3.8, f is continuous. Since f (0) = −2 and f (1) = 3, and 0 is between −2 and 3,
there is a c ∈ (0, 1) such that f (c) = 0.
♣
This example also points the way to a simple method for approximating roots.
Example 3.57: Approximating Roots

Approximate the root of the previous example to one decimal place.
Solution. If we compute f (0.1), f (0.2), and so on, we find that f (0.6) < 0 and f (0.7) > 0, so by the
Intermediate Value Theorem, f has a root between 0.6 and 0.7. Repeating the process with f (0.61),
f (0.62), and so on, we find that f (0.61) < 0 and f (0.62) > 0, so f has a root between 0.61 and 0.62, and
the root is 0.6 rounded to one decimal place.

4.1 The Rate of Change of a Function
Suppose that y is a function of x, say y = f (x). It is often useful to know how sensitive the value of y is to
small changes in x.
Example 4.1: Small Changes in x
p
Consider y = f (x) = 625 − x2 (the upper semicircle of radius 25 centered at the origin), and let’s
compute the changes of y resulting from small changes of x around x = 7.
√
Solution. When x = 7, we find that y = 625 − 49 = 24. Suppose we want to know how much y changes
when x increases a little, say to 7.1 or 7.01.
In the case of a straight line y = mx + b, the slope m = ∆y/∆x measures the change in y per unit change
in x. This can be interpreted as a measure of “sensitivity”; for example, if y = 100x + 5, a small change in
x corresponds to a change one hundred times as large in y, so y is quite sensitive to changes in x.
p
Let us look at the same ratio ∆y/∆x for our function y = f (x) = 625 − x2 when x changes from 7 to
7.1. Here ∆x = 7.1 − 7 = 0.1 is the change in x, and
∆y = f (x + ∆x) − f (x) = f (7.1) − f (7)
p
p
= 625 − 7.12 − 625 − 72
≈ 23.9706 − 24 = −0.0294.
Thus, ∆y/∆x ≈ −0.0294/0.1 = −0.294. This means that y changes by less than one third the change in x,
so apparently y is not very sensitive to changes in x at x = 7. We say “apparently” here because we don’t
really know what happens between 7 and 7.1. Perhaps y changes dramatically as x runs through the values
from 7 to 7.1, but at 7.1 y just happens to be close to its value at 7. This is not in fact the case for this
♣
particular function, but we don’t yet know why.
The quantity ∆y/∆x ≈ −0.294 may be interpreted as the slope of the line through (7, 24) and (7.1, 23.9706),
called a chord of the circle. In general, if we draw the chord from the point (7, 24) to a nearby point on
the semicircle (7 + ∆x, f (7 + ∆x)), the slope of this chord is the so-called difference quotient
p
f (7 + ∆x) − f (7)
625 − (7 + ∆x)2 − 24
=
.
∆x
∆x
115

116

Derivatives

For example, if x changes only from 7 to 7.01, then the difference quotient (slope of the chord) is approximately equal to (23.997081 − 24)/0.01 = −0.2919. This is slightly different than for the chord from
(7, 24) to (7.1, 23.9706).
As ∆x is made smaller (closer to 0), 7 + ∆x gets closer to 7 and the chord joining (7, f (7)) to (7 +
∆x, f (7 + ∆x)) shifts slightly, as shown in Figure 4.1. The chord gets closer and closer to the tangent line
to the circle at the point (7, 24). (The tangent line is the line that just grazes the circle at that point, i.e., it
doesn’t meet the circle at any second point.) Thus, as ∆x gets smaller and smaller, the slope ∆y/∆x of the
chord gets closer and closer to the slope of the tangent line. This is actually quite difficult to see when ∆x
is small, because of the scale of the graph. The values of ∆x used for the figure are 1, 5, 10 and 15, not
really very small values. The tangent line is the one that is uppermost at the right hand endpoint.

Figure 4.1: Chords approximating the tangent line.
So far we have found the slopes of two chords that should be close to the slope of the tangent line, but
what is the slope of the tangent line exactly? Since the tangent line touches the circle at just one point, we
will never be able to calculate its slope directly, using two “known” points on the line. What we need is a
way to capture what happens to the slopes of the chords as they get “closer and closer” to the tangent line.
Instead of looking at more particular values of ∆x, let’s see what happens if we do some algebra with the
difference quotient using just ∆x. The slope of a chord from (7, 24) to a nearby point (7 + ∆x, f (7 + ∆x))

Now, can we tell by looking at this last formula what happens when ∆x gets very
p close to zero? The
numerator clearly gets very close to −14 while the denominator gets very close to 625 − 72 + 24 = 48.
The fraction is therefore very close to −14/48 = −7/24 ∼
= −0.29167. In fact, the slope of the tangent line
is exactly −7/24.
What about the slope of the tangent line at x = 12? Well, 12 can’t be all that different from 7; we just
have to redo the calculation with 12 instead of 7. This won’t be hard, but it will be a bit tedious. What if
we try to do all the algebra without using a specific value for x? Let’s copy from above, replacing 7 by x.

Replacing x by 7 gives −7/24, as before, and now we can easily do the computation for 12 or any other
value of x between −25 and 25.
p
So now we have a single expression, −x/ 625 − x2 , that tells us the slope of the tangent line for any
value of x. This slope, in turn, tells us how sensitive the value of y is to small changes in the value of x.
p
The expression −x/ 625 − x2 defines a new function called the derivative of the original function
(since it is derived from the original function). If the original is referred to as f or y then the derivative
′
′
is often
“f prime” or “y prime”). So in this case we might write f ′ (x) =
p written f or y (pronounced
p
−x/ 625 − x2 or y′ = −x/ 625 − x2 . At a particular point, say x = 7, we write f ′ (7) = −7/24 and we
say that “ f prime of 7 is −7/24” or “the derivative of f at 7 is −7/24.”
To summarize, we compute the derivative of f (x) by forming the difference quotient
f (x + ∆x) − f (x)
,
∆x
which is the slope of a line, then we figure out what happens when ∆x gets very close to 0.

Derivatives

At this point, we should note that the idea of letting ∆x get closer and closer to 0 is precisely the idea
of a limit that we discussed in the last chapter. The limit here is a limit as ∆x approaches 0. Using limit
f (x)
.
notation, we can write f ′ (x) = lim∆x→0 f (x+∆x)−
∆x
In the particular case of a circle, there’s a simple way to find the derivative. Since the tangent to a circle
at a point is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of contact, its slope is the negative reciprocal
of the slope of the radius. The radius joining (0, 0)
pto (7, 24) has slope 24/7.
p Hence, the tangent line has
2
slope −7/24. In general,
a radius to the point (x, 625 − x ) has slope 625 − x2 /x, so the slope of the
p
tangent line is −x/ 625 − x2 , as before. It is NOT always true that a tangent line is perpendicular to a
line from the origin—don’t use this shortcut in any other circumstance.
As above, and as you might expect, for different values of x we generally get different values of the
derivative f ′ (x). Could it be that the derivative always has the same value? This would mean that the slope
of f , or the slope of its tangent line, is the same everywhere. One curve that always has the same slope is
a line; it seems odd to talk about the tangent line to a line, but if it makes sense at all the tangent line must
be the line itself. It is not hard to see that the derivative of f (x) = mx + b is f ′ (x) = m.

Velocity
We started this section by saying, “It is often useful to know how sensitive the value of y is to small
√ changes
in x.” We have seen one purely mathematical example of this, involving the function f (x) = 625 − x2 .
Here is a more applied example.
With careful measurement it might be possible to discover that the height of a dropped ball t seconds
after it is released is h(t) = h0 − kt 2 . (Here h0 is the initial height of the ball, when t = 0, and k is some
number determined by the experiment.) A natural question is then, “How fast is the ball going at time
t?” We can certainly get a pretty good idea with a little simple arithmetic. To make the calculation more
concrete, let’s use units of meters and seconds and say that h0 = 100 meters and k = 4.9. Suppose we’re
interested in the speed at t = 2. We know that when t = 2 the height is 100 − 4 · 4.9 = 80.4 meters. A
second later, at t = 3, the height is 100 − 9 · 4.9 = 55.9 meters. The change in height during that second is
55.9 − 80.4 = −24.5 meters. The negative sign means the height has decreased, as we expect for a falling
ball, and the number 24.5 is the average speed of the ball during the time interval, in meters per second.
We might guess that 24.5 meters per second is not a terrible estimate of the speed at t = 2, but certainly
we can do better. At t = 2.5 the height is 100 − 4.9(2.5)2 = 69.375 meters. During the half second from
t = 2 to t = 2.5, the change in height is 69.375 − 80.4 = −11.025 meters giving an average speed of
11.025/(1/2) = 22.05 meters per second. This should be a better estimate of the speed at t = 2. So it’s
clear now how to get better and better approximations: compute average speeds over shorter and shorter
time intervals. Between t = 2 and t = 2.01, for example, the ball drops 0.19649 meters in one hundredth
of a second, at an average speed of 19.649 meters per second.
We still might reasonably ask for the precise speed at t = 2 (the instantaneous speed) rather than just
an approximation to it. For this, once again, we need a limit. Let’s calculate the average speed during the
time interval from t = 2 to t = 2 + ∆t without specifying a particular value for ∆t. The change in height
during the time interval from t = 2 to t = 2 + ∆t is
h(2 + ∆t) − h(2) = (100 − 4.9(2 + ∆t)2) − 80.4

= 100 − 4.9(4 + 4∆t + ∆t 2 ) − 80.4

= 100 − 19.6 − 19.6∆t − 4.9∆t 2 − 80.4
= −19.6∆t − 4.9∆t 2
= −∆t(19.6 + 4.9∆t)
The average speed during this time interval is then
∆t(19.6 + 4.9∆t)
= 19.6 + 4.9∆t.
∆t
When ∆t is very small, this is very close to 19.6. Indeed, lim∆x→0 (19.6 + 4.9∆t) = 19.6. So the exact
speed at t = 2 is 19.6 meters per second.
At this stage we need to make a distinction between speed and velocity. Velocity is signed speed, that
is, speed with a direction indicated by a sign (positive or negative). Our algebra above actually told us that
the instantaneous velocity of the ball at t = 2 is −19.6 meters per second. The number 19.6 is the speed
and the negative sign indicates that the motion is directed downwards (the direction of decreasing height).
In the language of the previous section, we might have started with f (x) = 100 − 4.9x2 and asked for
the slope of the tangent line at x = 2. We would have answered that question by computing
f (2 + ∆x) − f (2)
−19.6∆x − 4.9∆x2
= lim
= −19.6 − 4.9∆x = 19.6

The algebra is the same. Thus, the velocity of the ball is the value of the derivative of a certain function,
namely, of the function that gives the position of the ball.
The upshot is that this problem, finding the velocity of the ball, is exactly the same problem mathematically as finding the slope of a curve. This may already be enough evidence to convince you that whenever
some quantity is changing (the height of a curve or the height of a ball or the size of the economy or
the distance of a space probe from earth or the population of the world) the rate at which the quantity is
changing can, in principle, be computed in exactly the same way, by finding a derivative.

between time 2 and time 2 + ∆t. (If you substitute ∆t = 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 in this formula you should again
get the answers to parts (a)–(d).) Next, in your formula for average speed (which should be in simplified
form) determine what happens as ∆t approaches zero. This is the instantaneous speed. Finally, in your
graph of y = t 2 draw the straight line through the point (2, 4) whose slope is the instantaneous velocity

1 sec and 1.1 sec, (b) 1 sec and 1.01 sec, (c) 1 sec and 1.001 sec. Now use algebra to find a simple formula
for the average velocity of the falling object between 1 sec and 1 + ∆t sec. Determine what happens to
this average velocity as ∆t approaches 0. That is the instantaneous velocity at time t = 1 second (it will
be negative, because the object is falling).

4.2 The Derivative Function
In Section 4.1, we have seen how to create, or derive, a new function f ′ (x) from a function f (x), and
that this new function carries important information. In one example we saw that f ′ (x) tells us how steep
the graph of f (x) is; in another we saw that f ′ (x) tells us the velocity of an object if f (x) tells us the
position of the object at time x. As we said earlier, this same mathematical idea is useful whenever f (x)
represents some changing quantity and we want to know something about how it changes, or roughly, the
“rate” at which it changes. Most functions encountered in practice are built up from a small collection of
“primitive” functions in a few simple ways, for example, by adding or multiplying functions together to
get new, more complicated functions. To make good use of the information provided by f ′ (x) we need to
be able to compute it for a variety of such functions.
We will begin to use different notations for the derivative of a function. While initially confusing, each
is often useful so it is worth maintaining multiple versions of the same thing.

The denominator here measures a distance in the x direction, sometimes called the “run”, and the numerator measures a distance in the y direction, sometimes called the “rise,” and “rise over run” is the slope of
a line. Recall that sometimes such a numerator is abbreviated ∆y, exchanging brevity for a more detailed
expression. So in general, we define a derivative by the following equation.

In other words, dy/dx is another notation for the derivative, and it reminds us that it is related to an actual
slope between two points. This notation is called Leibniz notation, after Gottfried Leibniz, who developed
the fundamentals of calculus independently, at about the same time that Isaac Newton did. Again, since
we often use f and f (x) to mean the original function, we sometimes use d f /dx and d f (x)/dx to refer to
the derivative. If the function f (x) is written out in full we often write the last of these something like this
f ′ (x) =

with the function written to the side, instead of trying to fit it into the numerator.

♣
Note: If you happen to know some “derivative formulas” from an earlier course, for the time being
you should pretend that you do not know them. In examples like the ones above and the exercises below,
you are required to know how to find the derivative formula starting from basic principles. We will later

124

Derivatives

develop some formulas so that we do not always need to do such computations, but we will continue to
need to know how to do the more involved computations.
f (x)
To recap, given any function f and any number x in the domain of f , we define f ′ (x) = limh→0 f (x+h)−
h
wherever this limit exists, and we call the number f ′ (x) the derivative of f at x. Geometrically, f ′ (x) is the
slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at the point (x, f (x)). The following symbols also represent the
derivative:
dy d f

f ′ (x) = y′ =

f (x).
dx dx dx
The symbol d/dx is called a differential operator which means to take the derivative of the function f (x)
with respect to the variable x.
In the next example we emphasize the geometrical interpretation of derivative.

Example 4.6: Geometrical Interpretation of Derivative

Consider the function f (x) given by the graph below. Verify that the graph of f ′ (x) is indeed the
derivative of f (x) by analyzing slopes of tangent lines to the graph at different points.
y

f(x)

x

f '(x)
Solution. We must think about the tangent lines to the graph of f , because the slopes of these lines are the
values of f ′ (x).
We start by checking the graph of f for horizontal tangent lines, since horizontal lines have a slope of 0.
We find that the tangent line is horizontal at the points where x has the values -1.9 and 1.8 (approximately).
At each of these values of x, we must have f ′ (x) = 0, which means that the graph of f ′ has an x-intercept
(a point where the graph intersects the x-axis).
Note that horizontal tangent lines have a slope of zero and these occur approximately at the points
(−1.9, −3.2) and (1.8, 3.2) of the graph. Therefore f ′ (x) will cross the x-axis when x = −1.9 and x = 1.8.
Analyzing the slope of the tangent line of f (x) at x = 0 gives approximately 3.0, thus, f ′ (0) = 3.0.
Similarly, analyzing the slope of the tangent lines of f (x) at x = 1 and x = −1 give approximately 2.0 for
both, thus, f ′ (1) = f ′ (−1) = 2.0.
♣
In the next example we verify that the slope of a straight line is m.

Example 4.7: Derivative of a Linear Function

This is not surprising. We know that f ′ (x) always represents the slope of a tangent line to the graph of
f . In this example, since the graph of f is a straight line y = mx + b already, every tangent line is the same
line y = mx + b. Since this line has a slope of m, we must have f ′ (x) = m.
♣

4.2.1. Differentiable
Now that we have introduced the derivative of a function at a point, we can begin to use the adjective
differentiable.
Definition 4.8: Differentiable at a Point

A function f is differentiable at point a if f ′ (a) exists.

Definition 4.9: Differentiable on an Interval

A function f is differentiable on an open interval if it is differentiable at every point in the interval.
Sometimes one encounters a point in the domain of a function y = f (x) where there is no derivative,
because there is no tangent line. In order for the notion of the tangent line at a point to make sense, the
curve must be “smooth” at that point. This means that if you imagine a particle traveling at some steady
speed along the curve, then the particle does not experience an abrupt change of direction. There are
two types of situations you should be aware of—corners and cusps—where there’s a sudden change of
direction and hence no derivative.
Example 4.10: Derivative of the Absolute Value

Discuss the derivative of the absolute value function y = f (x) = |x|.
Solution. If x is positive, then this is the function y = x, whose derivative is the constant 1. (Recall that
when y = f (x) = mx + b, the derivative is the slope m.) If x is negative, then we’re dealing with the
function y = −x, whose derivative is the constant −1. If x = 0, then the function has a corner, i.e., there
is no tangent line. A tangent line would have to point in the direction of the curve—but there are two
directions of the curve that come together at the origin.

In particular, the absolute value function f (x) = |x| is not differentiable at x = 0.

♣

We note that the following theorem can be proved using limits.
Theorem 4.11: Differentiable implies Continuity

If f is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.
Proof. Suppose that f is differentiable at a. That is,
f ′ (a) = lim

h→0

f (a + h) − f (a)
h

exists. At this stage, we find it convenient to write this limit in an alternative form so that its connection
with continuity can become more easily seen. If we let x = a + h, then h = x − a. Furthermore, h → 0 is
equivalent to x → a. So,
f (x) − f (a)
f ′ (a) = lim

(This alternative formulation of the derivative is also standard. We will use it whenever we find it convenient to do so. You should get familiar with it.) Continuity at a can now be proved as follows:


f (x) − f (a)
lim f (x) = lim
· (x − a) + f (a)

f (x) − f (a)

= f (a) · (a − a) + f (a)
= f (a) .
♣
However, if f is continuous at a it is not necessarily true that f is differentiable at a. For example, it
was shown that f (x) = |x| is not differentiable at x = 0 in the previous example, however, one can observe
that f (x) = |x| is continuous everywhere.

4.2. The Derivative Function

127

Example 4.12: Derivative of y = x2/3

Discuss the derivative of the function y = x2/3 , shown in Figure 4.2.
Solution. We will later see how to compute this derivative; for now we use the fact that y′ = (2/3)x−1/3 .
Visually this looks much like the absolute value function, but it technically has a cusp, not a corner. The
absolute value function has no tangent line at 0 because there are (at least) two obvious contenders—the
tangent line of the left side of the curve and the tangent line of the right side. The function y = x2/3 does
not have a tangent line at 0, but unlike the absolute value function it can be said to have a single direction:
as we approach 0 from either side the tangent line becomes closer and closer to a vertical line; the curve
is vertical at 0. But as before, if you imagine traveling along the curve, an abrupt change in direction is
required at 0: a full 180 degree turn.

In practice we won’t worry much about the distinction between these examples; in both cases the
function has a “sharp point” where there is no tangent line and no derivative.

4.2.2. Second and Other Derivatives
If f is a differentiable function then its derivative f ′ is also a function and so we can take the derivative of
f ′ . The new function, denoted by f ′′ , is called the second derivative of f , since it is the derivative of the
derivative of f .
The following symbols represent the second derivative:

We can continue this process to get the third derivative of f .
In general, the nth derivative of f is denoted by f (n) and is obtained from f by differentiating n times.
If y = f (x), then we write:
d ny
y(n) = f (n) (x) = n .

4.2.3. Velocities
Suppose f (t) is a position function of an object, representing the displacement of the object from the
origin at time t. In terms of derivatives, the velocity of an object is:
v(a) = f ′ (a)
The change of velocity with respect to time is called the acceleration and can be found as follows:
a(t) = v′ (t) = f ′′ (t).
Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function and the second derivative of the position function.
Example 4.13: Position, Velocity and Acceleration

Suppose the position function of an object is f (t) = t 2 metres at t seconds. Find the velocity and
acceleration of the object at time t = 1s.
Solution. By the definition of velocity and acceleration we need to compute f ′ (t) and f ′′ (t). Using the
definition of derivative, we have,
(t + h)2 − t 2
2th + h2
= lim
= lim (2t + h) = 2t.
h→0
h
h→0
h
h→0

f ′ (t) = lim

Therefore, v(t) = f ′ (t) = 2t. Thus, the velocity at time t = 1 is v(1) = 2 m/s. We now have that the
acceleration at time t is:
2(t + h) − 2t
2h
= lim
= 2.
h→0
h
h→0 h

a(t) = f ′′ (t) = lim

Therefore, a(t) = 2. Substituting t = 1 into the function a(t) gives a(1) = 2 m/s2 .

4.3 Derivative Rules
Using the definition of the derivative of a function is quite tedious. In this section we introduce a number
of different shortcuts that can be used to compute the derivative. Recall that the definition of derivative is:
Given any number x for which the limit
f ′ (x) = lim

h→0

f (x + h) − f (x)
h

exists, we assign to x the number f ′ (x).
Next, we give some basic derivative rules for finding derivatives without having to use the limit definition directly.
Theorem 4.14: Derivative of a Constant Function

Let c be a constant, then

d
(c) = 0.
dx

Proof. Let f (x) = c be a constant function. By the definition of derivative:
f ′ (x) = lim

h→0

c−c
f (x + h) − f (x)
= lim
= lim 0 = 0.
h→0 h
h→0
h
♣

Example 4.15: Derivative of a Constant Function

The derivative of f (x) = 17 is f ′ (x) = 0 since the derivative of a constant is 0.

Theorem 4.16: The Power Rule

If n is a positive integer, then

d n
(x ) = nxn−1 .
dx

Proof. We use the formula:
xn − an = (x − a)(xn−1 + xn−2 a + · · · + xan−2 + an−1 )

4.3. Derivative Rules

131

which can be verified by mulitplying out the right side. Let f (x) = xn be a power function for some
positive integer n. Then at any number a we have:
f ′ (a) = lim

x→a

f (x) − f (a)
xn − an
= lim
= lim (xn−1 + xn−2 a + · · · + xan−2 + an−1 ) = nan−1 .
x→a x − a
x→a
x−a

♣

It turns out that the Power Rule holds for any real number n (though it is a bit more difficult to prove).
Theorem 4.17: The Power Rule (General)

If n is any real number, then

d n
(x ) = nxn−1 .
dx

Example 4.18: Derivative of a Power Function

By the power rule, the derivative of g(x) = x4 is g′ (x) = 4x3 .

If c is a constant and f is a differentiable function, then

By the constant multiple rule and the previous example, the derivative of F(x) = 2 · (17 + x4 ) is
F ′ (x) = 2(4x3 ) = 8x3 .

By the sum/difference rule, the derivative of h(x) = 17 + x4 is

with f (x) = 3x − 1 and g(x) = 2x + 3. Note that f ′ (x) = 3 and g′ (x) = 2, so,
h′ (x) = (3) · (2x + 3) + (3x − 1) · (2) = 6x + 9 + 6x − 2 = 12x + 7.

Exercise 4.4.2 Find the points on the curve y = x + 2 cos x that have a horizontal tangent line.

4.5 The Chain Rule
√
Let h(x) = 625 − x2 . The rules stated √
previously do not allow us to find h′ (x). However, h(x) is a
composition of two functions. Let f (x) = x and g(x) = 625 − x2 . Then we see that
h(x) = ( f ◦ g)(x).
From our rules we know that f ′ (x) = 12 x−1/2 and g′ (x) = −2x, thus it would be convenient to have a rule
which allows us to differentiate f ◦ g in terms of f ′ and g′ . This gives rise to the chain rule.
The Chain Rule
If g is differentiable at x and f is differentiable at g(x), then the composite function h = f ◦ g [recall
f ◦ g is defined as f (g(x))] is differentiable at x and h′ (x) is given by:
h′ (x) = f ′ (g(x)) · g′(x).

The chain rule has a particularly simple expression if we use the Leibniz notation for the derivative.
The quantity f ′ (g(x)) is the derivative of f with x replaced by g; this can be written d f /dg. As usual,
g′ (x) = dg/dx. Then the chain rule becomes
d f dg
df
=
.
dx
dg dx
This looks like trivial arithmetic, but it is not: dg/dx is not a fraction, that is, not literal division, but a
single symbol that means g′ (x). Nevertheless, it turns out that what looks like trivial arithmetic, and is
therefore easy to remember, is really true.
It will take a bit of practice to make the use of the chain rule come naturally—it is more complicated
than the earlier differentiation rules we have seen.
Example 4.30: Chain Rule
p
Compute the derivative of 625 − x2 .

p
Solution. We already know that the answer is −x/ 625 − x2 , computed directly from the limit. In the
√
context of the chain rule, we have f (x) = x, g(x) = 625 − x2 . We know that f ′ (x) = (1/2)x−1/2 , so
f ′ (g(x)) = (1/2)(625 − x2)−1/2 . Note that this is a two step computation: first compute f ′ (x), then replace
x by g(x). Since g′ (x) = −2x we have

Example 4.31: Chain Rule
p
Compute the derivative of 1/ 625 − x2 .
Solution. This is a quotient with a constant numerator, so we could use the quotient rule, but it is simpler
to use the chain rule. The function is (625 − x2 )−1/2 , the composition of f (x) = x−1/2 and g(x) = 625 − x2 .
We compute f ′ (x) = (−1/2)x−3/2 using the power rule, and then
f ′ (g(x))g′(x) =

In practice, of course, you will need to use more than one of the rules we have developed to compute
the derivative of a complicated function.
Example 4.32: Derivative of Quotient

Compute the derivative of

f (x) = √

4.6 Derivatives of Exponential & Logarithmic Functions
As with the sine function, we don’t know anything about derivatives that allows us to compute the derivatives of the exponential and logarithmic functions without going back to basics. Let’s do a little work with
the definition again:
d x

dx

lim ax

143

lim

∆x→0

a∆x − 1
∆x

a∆x − 1
∆x→0 ∆x

= ax lim

There are two interesting things to note here: As in the case of the sine function we are left with a limit
that involves ∆x but not x, which means that if lim (a∆x − 1)/∆x exists, then it is a constant number. This
∆x→0

means that ax has a remarkable property: its derivative is a constant times itself.
We earlier remarked that the hardest limit we would compute is lim sin x/x = 1; we now have a limit
x→0

that is just a bit too hard to include here. In fact the hard part is to see that lim (a∆x − 1)/∆x even exists—
∆x→0

does this fraction really get closer and closer to some fixed value? Yes it does, but we will not prove this
fact.
We can look at some examples. Consider (2x − 1)/x for some small values of x: 1, 0.828427124,
0.756828460, 0.724061864, 0.70838051, 0.70070877 when x is 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively.
It looks like this is settling in around 0.7, which turns out to be true (but the limit is not exactly 0.7).
Consider next (3x − 1)/x: 2, 1.464101616, 1.264296052, 1.177621520, 1.13720773, 1.11768854, at the
same values of x. It turns out to be true that in the limit this is about 1.1. Two examples don’t establish a
pattern, but if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with the value of a: bigger
a, bigger limit; smaller a, smaller limit. As we can already see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and
some larger than 1. Somewhere between a = 2 and a = 3 the limit will be exactly 1; the value at which
this happens is called e, so that
e∆x − 1
= 1.
lim
∆x→0 ∆x
As you might guess from our two examples, e is closer to 3 than to 2, and in fact e ≈ 2.718.
Now we see that the function ex has a truly remarkable property:
d x
e =
dx

ex+∆x − ex

∆x

=

lim ex

lim

∆x→0

e∆x − 1
∆x

e∆x − 1
∆x→0 ∆x

= ex lim
= ex

That is, ex is its own derivative, or in other words the slope of ex is the same as its height, or the same as its
second coordinate: The function f (x) = ex goes through the point (z, ez) and has slope ez there, no matter

144

Derivatives

what z is. It is sometimes convenient to express the function ex without an exponent, since complicated
2
exponents can be hard to read. In such cases we use exp(x), e.g., exp(1 + x2 ) instead of e1+x .
What about the logarithm function? This too is hard, but as the cosine function was easier to do once
the sine was done, so is the logarithm easier to do now that we know the derivative of the exponential
function. Let’s start with loge x, which as you probably know is often abbreviated ln x and called the
“natural logarithm” function.
Consider the relationship between the two functions, namely, that they are inverses, that one “undoes”
the other. Graphically this means that they have the same graph except that one is “flipped” or “reflected”
through the line y = x:

Figure 4.3: The exponential and logarithmic functions.
This means that the slopes of these two functions are closely related as well: For example, the slope of ex
is e at x = 1; at the corresponding point on the ln(x) curve, the slope must be 1/e, because the “rise” and
the “run” have been interchanged. Since the slope of ex is e at the point (1, e), the slope of ln(x) is 1/e at
the point (e, 1).

Figure 4.4: The exponential and logarithmic functions.
More generally, we know that the slope of ex is ez at the point (z, ez ), so the slope of ln(x) is 1/ez at
(ez , z). In other words, the slope of ln x is the reciprocal of the first coordinate at any point; this means that
the slope of ln x at (x, ln x) is 1/x. The upshot is:
1
d
ln x = .
dx

We have discussed this from the point of view of the graphs, which is easy to understand but is not normally
considered a rigorous proof—it is too easy to be led astray by pictures that seem reasonable but that miss

some hard point. It is possible to do this derivation without resorting to pictures, and indeed we will see
an alternate approach soon.
Note that ln x is defined only for x > 0. It is sometimes useful to consider the function ln |x|, a function
defined for x 6= 0. When x < 0, ln |x| = ln(−x) and

ln |x| =

Thus whether x is positive or negative, the derivative is the same.
What about the functions ax and loga x? We know that the derivative of ax is some constant times ax
itself, but what constant? Remember that “the logarithm is the exponent” and you will see that a = eln a .
Then
ax = (eln a )x = ex ln a ,
and we can compute the derivative using the chain rule:
d x
d
d
a = (eln a )x = ex ln a = (ln a)ex ln a = (ln a)ax .
dx

The constant is simply ln a. Likewise we can compute the derivative of the logarithm function loga x. Since
x = eln x
we can take the logarithm base a of both sides to get
loga (x) = loga (eln x ) = ln x loga e.
Then

d

loga x = loga e.

This is a perfectly good answer, but we can improve it slightly. Since

4.7 Implicit Differentiation
As we have seen, there is a close relationship between the derivatives of ex and ln x because these functions
are inverses. Rather than relying on pictures for our understanding, we would like to be able to exploit this
relationship computationally. In fact this technique can help us find derivatives in many situations, not just
when we seek the derivative of an inverse function.
We will begin by illustrating the technique to find what we already know, the derivative of ln x. Let’s
write y = ln x and then x = eln x = ey , that is, x = ey . We say that this equation defines the function y = ln x
implicitly because while it is not an explicit expression y = . . ., it is true that if x = ey then y is in fact the
natural logarithm function. Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of y is that x = ey ; what can
we say about derivatives? We can take the derivative of both sides of the equation:
d
d
x = ey .
dx
dx
Then using the chain rule on the right hand side:


d
1=
y ey = y′ ey .
dx
Then we can solve for y′ :

1
1
= .
y
e
x
There is one little difficulty here. To use the chain rule to compute d/dx(ey ) = y′ ey we need to know that
the function y has a derivative. All we have shown is that if it has a derivative then that derivative must
be 1/x. When using this method we will always have to assume that the desired derivative exists, but
fortunately this is a safe assumption for most such problems.
The example y = ln x involved an inverse function defined implicitly, but other functions can be defined
implicitly, and sometimes a single equation can be used to implicitly define more than one function.
Here’s a familiar example.
y′ =

Example 4.38: Derivative of Circle Equation

The equation r2 = x2 +y2 describes a circle of radius r. The circle is not a function y = f (x) because
for some values of x there are two corresponding values of y. If we want to work with a function, we
can break the circle into two pieces, the upper and lower semicircles, each of which is a function.
in fact this is a fairly simple
Let’s call these y = U (x) and y = L(x); p
p example, and it’s possible to give
explicit expressions for these: U (x) = r2 − x2 and L(x) = − r2 − x2 . But it’s somewhat easier,
and quite useful, to view both functions as given implicitly by r2 = x2 + y2 : both r2 = x2 +U (x)2
and r2 = x2 + L(x)2 are true, and we can think of r2 = x2 + y2 as defining both U (x) and L(x).
Now we can take the derivative of both sides as before, remembering that y is not simply a variable
but a function—in this case, y is either U (x) or L(x) but we’re not yet specifying which one. When
we take the derivative we just have to remember to apply the chain rule where y appears.

r =
(x + y2 )
dx

0 = 2x + 2yy′
−2x

y′ =

2y
y

Now we have an expression for y′ , but it contains y as well as x. This means that if we want to
compute y′ for some particular value of x we’ll have to know or compute y at that value of x as well.
It is at this point that we will need to know whether y is U (x) or L(x). Occasionally it will turn out
that we can avoid explicit use of U (x) or L(x) by the nature of the problem.

Example 4.39: Slope of the Circle
√
Find the slope of the circle 4 = x2 + y2 at the point (1, − 3).
Solution. Since we know both the x and y coordinates of the point of interest, we do not need to explicitly
recognize that this point is on L(x), and we do not need to use L(x) to compute y – but we could. Using
the calculation of y′ from above,
x

y′ = − = − √ = √ .

It is instructive to compare this approach to others.
p
√
We might have recognized at the start that (1, − 3) is on the function y = L(x) = − 4 − x2 . We
could then take the derivative of L(x), using the power rule and the chain rule, to get
1
x
L′ (x) = − (4 − x2 )−1/2 (−2x) = √
.
2
4 − x2
√
Then we could compute L′ (1) = 1/ 3 by substituting x = 1.
Alternately, we could realize that the point is on L(x), but use the fact that y′ = −x/y. Since the point
is on L(x) we can replace y by L(x) to get
y′ = −

Derivatives

without computing the derivative of L(x) explicitly. Then we substitute x = 1 and get the same answer as
before.
♣
In the case of the circle it is possible to find the functions U (x) and L(x) explicitly, but there are potential advantages to using implicit differentiation anyway. In some cases it is more difficult or impossible to
find an explicit formula for y and implicit differentiation is the only way to find the derivative.
Example 4.40: Derivative of Function defined Implicitly

Find the derivative of any function defined implicitly by yx2 + y2 = x.
Solution. We treat y as an unspecified function and use the chain rule:
d

(yx2 + y2 ) =

♣

You might think that the step in which we solve for y′ could sometimes be difficult—after all, we’re
using implicit differentiation here because we can’t solve the equation yx2 + ey = x for y, so maybe after
taking the derivative we get something that is hard to solve for y′ . In fact, this never happens. All
occurrences y′ come from applying the chain rule, and whenever the chain rule is used it deposits a single
y′ multiplied by some other expression. So it will always be possible to group the terms containing y′
together and factor out the y′ , just as in the previous example. If you ever get anything more difficult you
have made a mistake and should fix it before trying to continue.
It is sometimes the case that a situation leads naturally to an equation that defines a function implicitly.

Discuss the equation and derivative of the ellispe.
Solution. Consider all the points (x, y) that have the property that the distance from (x, y) to (x1 , y1 ) plus
the distance from (x, y) to (x2 , y2 ) is 2a (a is some constant). These points form an ellipse, which like a
circle is not a function but can be viewed as two functions pasted together. Since we know how to write
down the distance between two points, we can write down an implicit equation for the ellipse:
q

2
(x − x1 ) + (y − y1 ) + (x − x2 )2 + (y − y2 )2 = 2a.

In the previous examples we had functions involving x and y, and we thought of y as a function of
x. In these problems we differentiated with respect to x. So when faced with x’s in the function we
differentiated as usual, but when faced with y’s we differentiated as usual except we multiplied by a dy
dx for
that term because we were using Chain Rule.
In the following example we will assume that both x and y are functions of t and want to differentiate
the equation with respect to t. This means that every time we differentiate an x we will be using the Chain
dy
Rule, so we must multiply by dx
dt , and whenever we differentiate a y we multiply by dt .

Logarithmic Differentiation
Previously we’ve seen how to do the derivative of a number to a function (a f (x) )′ , and also a function to a
number [( f (x))n ]′ . But what about the derivative of a function to a function [( f (x))g(x) ]′ ?
In this case, we use a procedure known as logarithmic differentiation.
Steps for Logarithmic Differentiation
• Take ln of both sides of y = f (x) to get ln y = ln f (x) and simplify using logarithm properties,
• Differentiate implicitly with respect to x and solve for
• Replace y with its function of x (i.e., f (x)).

4.8 Derivatives of Inverse Functions
Suppose we wanted to find the derivative of the inverse, but do not have an actual formula for the inverse
function? Then we can use the following derivative formula for the inverse evaluated at a.
Derivative of f −1 (a)
Given an invertible function f (x), the derivative of its inverse function f −1 (x) evaluated at x = a is:


′
f −1 (a) =

1
f ′ [ f −1 (a)]

To see why this is true, start with the function y = f −1 (x). Write this as x = f (y) and differentiate both
sides implicitly with respect to x using the chain rule:
1 = f ′ (y) ·
Thus,

dy

f (y)

but y = f −1 (x), thus,

At the point x = a this becomes:

Example 4.48: Derivatives of Inverse Functions

′
Suppose f (x) = x5 + 2x3 + 7x + 1. Find f −1 (1).
Solution. First we should show that f −1 exists (i.e. that f is one-to-one). In this case the derivative
f ′ (x) = 5x4 + 6x2 + 7 is strictly greater than 0 for all x, so f is strictly increasing and thus one-to-one.
It’s difficult to find the inverse of f (x) (and then take the derivative). Thus, we use the above formula
evaluated at 1:
 −1 ′
1
f
.
(1) = ′ −1
f [ f (1)]
Note that to use this formula we need to know what f −1 (1) is, and the derivative f ′ (x). To find f −1 (1)
we make a table of values (plugging in x = −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3 into f (x)) and see what value of x gives
1. We omit the table and simply observe that f (0) = 1. Thus,
f −1 (1) = 0.

Now we have:

And so, f ′ (0) = 7. Therefore,

trigonometric functions.
In the following examples we will derive the formulae for the derivative of the inverse sine, inverse
cosine and inverse tangent. The other three inverse trigonometric functions have been left as exercises at
the end of this section.
Example 4.49: Derivative of Inverse Sine

Find the derivative of sin−1 (x).

the opposite√side length using Pythagorean Theorem we obtain 1 − x2 . Using this triangle we can see
that sin y = 1 − x2 (0 ≤ y ≤ π ). Substituting this into the equation for dy/dx, we find that

5. Applications of Derivatives
In this chapter we explore how to use derivative and differentiation to solve a variety of problems, some
mathematical and some practical. We explore some applications which motivated and were formalized
in the definition of the derivative, and look at a few clever uses of the tangent line (which has immediate
geometric ties to the definition of the derivative).

5.1 Related Rates
When defining the derivative f ′ (x), we define it to be exactly the rate of change of f (x) with respect to
x. Consequently, any question about rates of change can be rephrased as a question about derivatives.
When we calculate derivatives, we are calculating rates of change. Results and answers we obtain for
derivatives translate directly into results and answers about rates of change. Let us look at some examples
where more than one variable is involved, and where our job is to analyze and exploit relations between
the rates of change of these variables. The mathematical step of relating the rates of change turns out to
be largely an exercise in differentiation using the chain rule or implicit differentiation. This explains why
some textbooks place this section shortly after the sections on the chain rule and implicit differentiation.
Suppose we have two variables x and y (in most problems the letters will be different, but for now
let’s use x and y) which are both changing with time. A “related rates” problem is a problem in which
we know one of the rates of change at a given instant—say, ẋ = dx/dt—and we want to find the other
rate ẏ = dy/dt at that instant. (The use of ẋ to mean dx/dt goes back to Newton and is still used for this
purpose, especially by physicists.)
If y is written in terms of x, i.e., y = f (x), then this is easy to do using the chain rule:
ẏ =

dy dy dx dy
=
·
= ẋ.
dt
dx dt
dx

That is, find the derivative of f (x), plug in the value of x at the instant in question, and multiply by the
given value of ẋ = dx/dt to get ẏ = dy/dt.
Example 5.1: Speed at which a Coordinate is Changing

Suppose an object is moving along a path described by y = x2 , that is, it is moving on a parabolic
path. At a particular time, say t = 5, the x coordinate is 6 and we measure the speed at which the x
coordinate of the object is changing and find that dx/dt = 3.
At the same time, how fast is the y coordinate changing?
Solution. Using the chain rule, dy/dt = 2x · dx/dt. At t = 5 we know that x = 6 and dx/dt = 3, so
dy/dt = 2 · 6 · 3 = 36.

Applications of Derivatives

In many cases, particularly interesting ones, x and y will be related in some other way, for example
x = f (y), or F(x, y) = k, or perhaps F(x, y) = G(x, y), where F(x, y) and G(x, y) are expressions involving
both variables. In all cases, you can solve the related rates problem by taking the derivative of both sides,
plugging in all the known values (namely, x, y, and ẋ), and then solving for ẏ.
To summarize, here are the steps in doing a related rates problem.
Steps for Solving Related Rates Problems
1. Decide what the two variables are.
2. Find an equation relating them.
3. Take d/dt of both sides.
4. Plug in all known values at the instant in question.
5. Solve for the unknown rate.

Example 5.2: Receding Airplanes

A plane is flying directly away from you at 500 mph at an altitude of 3 miles. How fast is the plane’s
distance from you increasing at the moment when the plane is flying over a point on the ground 4
miles from you?
Solution. To see what’s going on, we first draw a schematic representation of the situation, as in Figure 5.1.
Because the plane is in level flight directly away from you, the rate at which x changes is the speed of
the plane, dx/dt = 500. The distance between you and the plane is y; it is dy/dt that we wish to know. By
the Pythagorean Theorem we know that x2 + 9 = y2 . Taking the derivative:
2xẋ = 2yẏ.
We are interested in the time at which x = 4; at this time we know that 42 + 9 = y2 , so y = 5. Putting
together all the information we get
2(4)(500) = 2(5)ẏ.
Thus, ẏ = 400 mph.

Example 5.3: Spherical Balloon

You are inflating a spherical balloon at the rate of 7 cm3 /sec. How fast is its radius increasing when
the radius is 4 cm?
Solution. Here the variables are the radius r and the volume V . We know dV /dt, and we want dr/dt. The
two variables are related by the equation V = 4π r3 /3. Taking the derivative of both sides gives dV /dt =
4π r2 ṙ. We now substitute the values we know at the instant in question: 7 = 4π 42 ṙ, so ṙ = 7/(64π )
cm/sec.
♣
Example 5.4: Conical Container

Water is poured into a conical container at the rate of 10 cm3 /sec. The cone points directly down,
and it has a height of 30 cm and a base radius of 10 cm; see Figure 5.2. How fast is the water level
rising when the water is 4 cm deep (at its deepest point)?
Solution. The water forms a conical shape within the big cone; its height and base radius and volume are
all increasing as water is poured into the container. This means that we actually have three things varying
with time: the water level h (the height of the cone of water), the radius r of the circular top surface of
water (the base radius of the cone of water), and the volume of water V . The volume of a cone is given by
V = π r2 h/3. We know dV /dt, and we want dh/dt. At first something seems to be wrong: we have a third
variable, r, whose rate we don’t know.
However, the dimensions of the cone of water must have the same proportions as those of the container.
That is, because of similar triangles, r/h = 10/30 so r = h/3. Now we can eliminate r from the problem
entirely: V = π (h/3)2h/3 = π h3 /27. We take the derivative of both sides and plug in h = 4 and dV /dt =
10, obtaining 10 = (3π · 42 /27)(dh/dt). Thus, dh/dt = 90/(16π ) cm/sec.

below Q at time t = 0, and is being pushed by someone who walks at 6 ft/sec from left to right.
Find (a) how fast the swing is rising after 1 sec; (b) the angular speed of the rope in deg/sec after 1
sec.
Solution. We start out by asking: What is the geometric quantity whose rate of change we know, and what
is the geometric quantity whose rate of change we’re being asked about? Note that the person pushing
the swing is moving horizontally at a rate we know. In other words, the horizontal coordinate of P is
increasing at 6 ft/sec. In the xy-plane let us make the convenient choice of putting the origin at the location
of P at time t = 0, i.e., a distance 10 directly below the point of attachment. Then the rate we know is
dx/dt, and in part (a) the rate we want is dy/dt (the rate at which P is rising). In part (b) the rate we
want is θ̇ = d θ /dt, where θ stands for the angle in radians through which the swing has swung from the
vertical. (Actually, since we want our answer in deg/sec, at the end we must convert d θ /dt from rad/sec
by multiplying by 180/π .)
(a) From the diagram we see that we have a right triangle whose legs are x and 10 − y, and whose hypotenuse is 10. Hence x2 + (10 − y)2 = 100. Taking the derivative of both sides we obtain: 2xẋ + 2(10 −
y)(0 − ẏ) = 0. We now look at what we know after 1 second, namely x = 6 (because x started at 0 and
has been increasing at the rate of 6 ft/sec for 1 sec), thus y = 2 (because we get 10 − y = 8 from the
Pythagorean theorem applied to the triangle with hypotenuse 10 and leg 6), and ẋ = 6. Putting in these
values gives us 2 · 6 · 6 − 2 · 8ẏ = 0, from which we can easily solve for ẏ: ẏ = 4.5 ft/sec.
(b) Here our two variables are x and θ , so we want to use the same right triangle as in part (a), but this
time relate θ to x. Since the hypotenuse is constant (equal to 10), the best way to do this is to use the
sine: sin θ = x/10. Taking derivatives we obtain (cos θ )θ̇ = 0.1ẋ. At the instant in question (t = 1 sec),
when we have a right triangle with sides 6–8–10, cos θ = 8/10 and ẋ = 6. Thus (8/10)θ̇ = 6/10, i.e.,
θ̇ = 6/8 = 3/4 rad/sec, or approximately 43 deg/sec.

We have seen that sometimes there are apparently more than two variables that change with time, but
in reality there are just two, as the others can be expressed in terms of just two. However sometimes there
really are several variables that change with time; as long as you know the rates of change of all but one of

5.1. Related Rates

167

them you can find the rate of change of the remaining one. As in the case when there are just two variables,
take the derivative of both sides of the equation relating all of the variables, and then substitute all of the
known values and solve for the unknown rate.
Example 5.6: Distance Changing Rate

A road running north to south crosses a road going east to west at the point P. Car A is driving
north along the first road, and car B is driving east along the second road. At a particular time car A
is 10 kilometers to the north of P and traveling at 80 km/hr, while car B is 15 kilometers to the east
of P and traveling at 100 km/hr. How fast is the distance between the two cars changing?
Solution. Let a(t) be the distance of car A north of P at time t, and b(t) the distance of car B east of
P at time t, and let c(t) be the distance from car A to car B at time t. By the Pythagorean Theorem,
c(t)2 = a(t)2 + b(t)2. Taking derivatives we get 2c(t)c′(t) = 2a(t)a′(t) + 2b(t)b′(t), so

Notice how this problem differs from Example 5.2. In both cases we started with the Pythagorean
Theorem and took derivatives on both sides. However, in Example 5.2 one of the sides was a constant (the
altitude of the plane), and so the derivative of the square of that side of the triangle was simply zero. In this
Example, on the other hand, all three sides of the right triangle are variables, even though we are interested
in a specific value of each side of the triangle (namely, when the sides have lengths 10 and 15). Make sure
that you understand at the start of the problem what are the variables and what are the constants.

5.2 Extrema of a Function
In calculus, there is much emphasis placed on analyzing the behaviour of a function f on an interval I.
Does f have a maximum value on I? Does it have a minimum value? How does the interval I impact our
discussion of extrema?

5.2.1. Local Extrema
A local maximum point on a function is a point (x, y) on the graph of the function whose y coordinate is
larger than all other y coordinates on the graph at points “close to” (x, y). More precisely, (x, f (x)) is a
local maximum if there is an interval (a, b) with a < x < b and f (x) ≥ f (z) for every z in (a, b). Similarly,
(x, y) is a local minimum point if it has locally the smallest y coordinate. Again being more precise:
(x, f (x)) is a local minimum if there is an interval (a, b) with a < x < b and f (x) ≤ f (z) for every z in
(a, b). A local extremum is either a local minimum or a local maximum.
Definition 5.7: Local Maxima and Minima

A real-valued function f has a local maximum at x0 if f (x0 ) is the largest value of f near x0 ; in
other words, f (x0 ≥ f (x) when x is near x0 .

A real-valued function f has a local minimum at x0 if f (x0 ) is the smallest value of f near x0 ; in
other words, f (x0 ) ≤ f (x) when x is near x0 .

Local maximum and minimum points are quite distinctive on the graph of a function, and are therefore
useful in understanding the shape of the graph. In many applied problems we want to find the largest or
smallest value that a function achieves (for example, we might want to find the minimum cost at which
some task can be performed) and so identifying maximum and minimum points will be useful for applied
problems as well. Some examples of local maximum and minimum points are shown in Figure 5.5.

Figure 5.5: Some local maximum points (A) and minimum points (B).
If (x, f (x)) is a point where f (x) reaches a local maximum or minimum, and if the derivative of f
exists at x, then the graph has a tangent line and the tangent line must be horizontal. This is important
enough to state as a theorem.
The proof is simple enough and we include it here, but you may accept Fermat’s Theorem based on its
strong intuitive appeal and come back to its proof at a later time.
Theorem 5.8: Fermat’s Theorem

If f (x) has a local extremum at x = a and f is differentiable at a, then f ′ (a) = 0.
Proof. We shall give the proof for the case where f (x) has a local maximum at x = a. The proof for the
local minimum case is similar.
Since f (x) has a local maximum at x = a, there is an open interval (c, d) with c < a < d and f (x) ≤
f (a) for every x in (c, d) . So, f (x) − f (a) ≤ 0 for all such x. Let us now look at the sign of the difference
f (x) − f (a)
quotient
. We consider two cases according as x > a or x < a.
x−a
f (x) − f (a)
If x > a, then x − a > 0 and so,
≤ 0. Taking limit as x approach a from the right, we get
x−a
lim

x→a+

f (x) − f (a)
≤ 0.
x−a

On the other hand, if x < a, then x − a < 0 and so,
left, we get

lim

x→a−

Since f is differentiable at a, f ′ (a) = lim

x→a+

f ′ (a) ≤ 0 and f ′ (a) ≥ 0. So, f ′ (a) = 0.

f (x) − f (a)
≥ 0. Taking limit as x approach a from the
x−a

f (x) − f (a)
≥ 0.
x−a

f (x) − f (a)
f (x) − f (a)
= lim
. Therefore, we have both
x−a
x−a
x→a−
♣

Thus, the only points at which a function can have a local maximum or minimum are points at which
the derivative is zero, as in the left hand graph in Figure 5.5, or the derivative is undefined, as in the right
hand graph. Any value of x in the domain of f for which f ′ (x) is zero or undefined is called a critical

5.2. Extrema of a Function

171

point for f . When looking for local maximum and minimum points, you are likely to make two sorts of
mistakes: You may forget that a maximum or minimum can occur where the derivative does not exist, and
so forget to check whether the derivative exists everywhere. You might also assume that any place that
the derivative is zero is a local maximum or minimum point, but this is not true. A portion of the graph of
f (x) = x3 is shown in Figure 5.6. The derivative of f is f ′ (x) = 3x2 , and f ′ (0) = 0, but there is neither a
maximum nor minimum at (0, 0).

Figure 5.6: No maximum or minimum even though the derivative is zero.
Since the derivative is zero or undefined at both local maximum and local minimum points, we need
a way to determine which, if either, actually occurs. The most elementary approach, but one that is often
tedious or difficult, is to test directly whether the y coordinates “near” the potential maximum or minimum
are above or below the y coordinate at the point of interest. Of course, there are too many points “near”
the point to test, but a little thought shows we need only test two provided we know that f is continuous
(recall that this means that the graph of f has no jumps or gaps).
Suppose, for example, that we have identified three points at which f ′ is zero or nonexistent: (x1 , y1 ),
(x2 , y2 ), (x3 , y3 ), and x1 < x2 < x3 (see Figure 5.7). Suppose that we compute the value of f (a) for
x1 < a < x2 , and that f (a) < f (x2 ). What can we say about the graph between a and x2 ? Could there be a
point (b, f (b)), a < b < x2 with f (b) > f (x2 )? No: if there were, the graph would go up from (a, f (a)) to
(b, f (b)) then down to (x2 , f (x2 )) and somewhere in between would have a local maximum point. (This is
not obvious; it is a result of the Extreme Value Theorem.) But at that local maximum point the derivative
of f would be zero or nonexistent, yet we already know that the derivative is zero or nonexistent only at
x1 , x2 , and x3 . The upshot is that one computation tells us that (x2 , f (x2 )) has the largest y coordinate of
any point on the graph near x2 and to the left of x2 . We can perform the same test on the right. If we find
that on both sides of x2 the values are smaller, then there must be a local maximum at (x2 , f (x2 )); if we
find that on both sides of x2 the values are larger, then there must be a local minimum at (x2 , f (x2 )); if we
find one of each, then there is neither a local maximum or minimum at x2 .

Applications of Derivatives

It is not always easy to compute the value of a function at a particular point. The task is made easier
by the availability of calculators and computers, but they have their own drawbacks—they do not always
allow us to distinguish between values that are very close together. Nevertheless, because this method is
conceptually simple and sometimes easy to perform, you should always consider it.

see that
√ f (− 3/3) = 2 3/9. This time we can use x =√0 and x = −1, and we find that f (−1) = f (0) =
0 < 2 3/9, so there must be a local maximum at x = − 3/3.
♣
Of course this example is made very simple by our choice of points to test, namely x = −1, 0, 1.
We could have used other values, say −5/4, 1/3, and 3/4, but this would have made the calculations
considerably more tedious, and we should always choose very simple points to test if we can.
Example 5.10: Max and Min

Find all local maximum and minimum points for f (x) = sin x + cos x.
Solution. The derivative is f ′ (x) = cos x − sin x. This is always defined and is zero whenever cos x = sin x.
Recalling that the cos x and sin x are the x and y coordinates of points on a unit circle, we see that cos x =
sin x when x is π /4, π /4 ± π , π /4 ± 2π , π /4 ± 3π , etc. Since both sine and cosine have a period of 2π , we
need only determine the status of√x = π /4 and x =
√5π /4. We can use 0 and π /2 to test the critical value
x = π /4. We find that f (π /4) = 2, f (0) = 1 < 2 and f (π /2) = 1, so there is a local maximum when
x = π /4 and also when x = π /4 ± 2π , π /4 ± 4π , etc. We can summarize this more neatly by saying that
there are local maxima at π /4 ± 2kπ for every integer k.

More succinctly, there are local minima at 5π /4 ± 2kπ for every integer k.

Example 5.11: Max and Min

Solution. The derivative is g′ (x) = 23 x−1/3 . This is undefined when x = 0 and is not equal to zero for any
x in the domain of g′ . Now we test two points on either side of x = 0. We use x = −1 and x = 1. Since
g (0) = 0, g (−1) = 1 > 0 and g (1) = 1 > 0, there must be a local minimum at x = 0.

5.2.2. Absolute Extrema
Absolute extrema are also commonly referred to as global extrema. Unlike local extrema, which are only
“extreme" relative to points “close to” them, an absolute (or global) extrema is “extreme" relative to all
other points in the interval under consideration.
Definition 5.12: Absolute Maxima and Minima

A real-valued function f has an absolute maximum on an interval I at x0 if f (x0 ) is the largest
value of f on I ; in other words, f (x0 ) ≥ f (x) for all x in the domain of f that are in I .

A real-valued function f has an absolute minimum on an interval I at x0 if f (x0 ) is the smallest
value of f on I ; in other words, f (x0 ) ≤ f (x) for all x in the domain of f that are in I .

Example 5.13: Absolute Extrema

Consider the function f (x) = x2 on the interval (−∞, ∞). This parabola has an absolute minimum
at x = 0. However, it does not have an absolute maximum.
Consider the function f (x) = |x| on the interval [−1, 2]. This graph looks like a check mark. It has
an absolute minimum at x = 0 and an absolute maximum at x = 2.
Consider the function f (x) = cos x on the interval [0, π ]. It has an absolute minimum at x = π and
an absolute maximum at x = 0.
Consider the function f (x) = ex on any interval [a, b], where a < b. Since this exponential function
is increasing, it has an absolute minimum at x = a and an absolute maximum at x = b.
Like Fermat’s Theorem, the following theorem has an intuitive appeal. However, unlike Fermat’s
Theorem, the proof relies on a more advanced concept called compactness, which will only be covered
in a course typically entitled Analysis. So, we will be content with understanding the statement of the
theorem.
Theorem 5.14: Extreme-Value Theorem

If a function f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], then f has both an absolute maximum and
an absolute minimum on [a, b].
Although this theorem tells us that an absolute extremum exists, it does not tell us what it is or how to
find it.
Note that if an absolute extremum is inside the interval (i.e. not an endpoint), then it must also be a
local extremum. This immediately tells us that to find the absolute extrema of a function on an interval,
we need only examine the local extrema inside the interval, and the endpoints of the interval.
We can devise a method for finding absolute extrema for a function f on a closed interval [a, b]:
1. Verify the function is continuous on [a, b].

2. Find the derivative and determine all critical values of f that are in [a, b].
3. Evaluate the function at the critical values found in Step 2 and the end points of the interval.
4. Identify the absolute extrema.
Why must a function be continuous on a closed interval in order to use this theorem? Consider the
following example.
Example 5.15: Absolute Extrema of a 1/x

Find any absolute extrema for f (x) = 1/x on the interval [−1, 1].
Solution. The function f is not continuous at x = 0. Since 0 ∈ [−1, 1], f is not continous on the closed
interval:
lim f (x) = +∞

x→0+

lim f (x) = −∞ ,

x→0−

so we are unable to apply the Extreme-Value Theorem. Therefore, f (x) = 1/x does not have an absolute
♣
maximum or an absolute minimum on [−1, 1].
However, if we consider the same function on an interval where it is continuous, the theorem will
apply. This is illustrated in the following example.
Example 5.16: Absolute Extrema of a 1/x

Find any absolute extrema for f (x) = 1/x on the interval [1, 2].
Solution. The function f is continous on the interval, so we can apply the Extreme-Value Theorem. We
begin with taking the derivative to be f ′ (x) = −1/x2 which has a critical value at x = 0, but since this
critical value is not in [1, 2] we ignore it. The only points where an extrema can occur are the endpoints
of the interval. To find the maximum or minimum we can simply evaluate the function: f (1) = 1 and
f (2) = 1/2, so the absolute maximum is at x = 1 and the absolute minimum is at x = 2.
♣
Why must an interval be closed in order to use the above theorem? Recall the difference between open
and closed intervals. Consider a function f on the open interval (0, 1). If we choose successive values of
x moving closer and closer to 1, what happens? Since 1 is not included in the interval we will not attain
exactly the value of 1. Suppose we reach a value of 0.9999 — is it possible to get closer to 1? Yes: There
are infinitely many real numbers between 0.9999 and 1. In fact, any conceivable real number close to 1
will have infinitely many real numbers between itself and 1. Now, suppose f is decreasing on (0, 1): As
we approach 1, f will continue to decrease, even if the difference between successive values of f is slight.
Similarly if f is increasing on (0, 1).
Consider a few more examples:

Example 5.17: Determining Absolute Extrema

Determine the absolute extrema of f (x) = x3 − x2 + 1 on the interval [−1, 2].
Solution. First, notice f is continuous on the closed interval [−1, 2], so we’re able to use Theorem 5.14 to
determine the absolute extrema. The derivative is f ′ (x) = 3x2 − 2x, and the critical values are x = 0, 2/3
which are both in the interval [−1, 2]. In order to find the absolute extrema, we must consider all critical
values that lie within the interval (that is, in (−1, 2)) and the endpoints of the interval.
f (−1) = (−1)3 − (−1)2 + 1 = −1
f (0) = (0)3 − (0)2 + 1 = 1

f (2/3) = (2/3)3 − (2/3)2 + 1 = 23/27
f (2) = (2)3 − (2)2 + 1 = 5

The absolute maximum is at (2,5) and the absolute minimum is at (-1,-1).

♣

Example 5.18: Determining Absolute Extrema

Determine the absolute extrema of f (x) = −9/x − x + 10 on the interval [2, 6].
Solution. First, notice f is continuous on the closed interval [2, 6], so we’re able to use Theorem 5.14 to
determine the absolute extrema. The function is not continuous at x = 0, but we can ignore this fact since
0 is not in [2, 6]. The derivative is f ′ (x) = 9/x2 − 1, and the critical values are x = ±3, but only x = +3 is
in the interval. In order to find the absolute extrema, we must consider all critical values that lie within the
interval and the endpoints of the interval.
f (2) = −9/(2) − (2) + 10 = 7/2 = 3.5
f (3) = −9/(3) − (3) + 10 = 4
f (6) = −9/(6) − (6) + 10 = 5/2 = 2.5
The absolute maximum is at (3,4) and the absolute minimum is at (6,2.5).

♣

When we are trying to find the absolute extrema of a function on an open interval, we cannot use
the Extreme Value Theorem. However, if the function is continuous on the interval, many of the same
ideas apply. In particular, if an absolute extremum exists, it must also be a local extremum. In addition
to checking values at the local extrema, we must check the behaviour of the function as it approaches the
ends of the interval.
Some examples to illustrate this method.
Example 5.19: Extrema of Secant

Find the extrema of sec(x) on (−π /2, π /2).
Solution. Notice sec(x) is continuous on (−π /2, π /2) and has one local minimum at 0. Also
lim

x→(−π /2)+

sec(x) =

lim

x→(π /2)−

sec(x) = +∞ ,

5.2. Extrema of a Function
so sec(x) has no absolute maximum, but the point (0, 1) is the absolute minimum.

A similar approach can be used for infinite intervals.

x2 + 1

Solution. Since x2 + 1 6= 0 for all x in (−∞, ∞) the function is continuous on this interval. This function
has only one critical value at x = 0, which is the local minimum and also the absolute minimum. Now,
2
limx→±∞ x2x+1 = 1, so the function does not have an absolute maximum: It continues to increase towards
1, but does not attain this exact value.

Applications of Derivatives

5.3 The Mean Value Theorem
There are numerous applications of the derivative through its definition as rate of change and as the slope
of the tangent line. In this section we shall look at some deeper reasons why the derivative turns out to be
so useful. The simple answer is that the derivative of a function tells us a lot about the function. More
important, “hard” questions about a function can sometimes be answered by solving a relatively simple
problem about the derivative of the function.

The Mean Value Theorem tells us that there is an intimate connection between the net change of the
value of any “sufficiently nice” function over an interval and the possible values of its derivative on that
interval. Because of this connection, we can draw conclusions about the possible values of the derivative
based on information about the values of the function, and conversely, we can draw conclusions about the
values of the function based on information about the values of its derivative.

Let us illustrate the idea through the following two interesting questions involving derivatives:
1. Suppose two different functions have the same derivative; what can you say about the relationship
between the two functions?

5.3. The Mean Value Theorem

179

2. Suppose you drive a car from toll booth on a toll road to another toll booth at an average speed of
70 miles per hour. What can be concluded about your actual speed during the trip? In particular, did
you exceed the 65 mile per hour speed limit?
While these sound very different, it turns out that the two problems are very closely related. We know
that “speed” is really the derivative by a different name; let’s start by translating the second question into
something that may be easier to visualize. Suppose that the function f (t) gives the position of your car on
the toll road at time t. Your change in position between one toll booth and the next is given by f (t1)− f (t0 ),
assuming that at time t0 you were at the first booth and at time t1 you arrived at the second booth. Your
average speed for the trip is ( f (t1) − f (t0))/(t1 −t0 ). If we think about the graph of f (t), the average speed
is the slope of the line that connects the two points (t0, f (t0 )) and (t1, f (t1 )). Your speed at any particular
time t between t0 and t1 is f ′ (t), the slope of the curve. Now question (2) becomes a question about slope.
In particular, if the slope between endpoints is 70, what can be said of the slopes at points between the
endpoints?
As a general rule, when faced with a new problem it is often a good idea to examine one or more
simplified versions of the problem, in the hope that this will lead to an understanding of the original
problem. In this case, the problem in its “slope” form is somewhat easier to simplify than the original, but
equivalent, problem.
Here is a special instance of the problem. Suppose that f (t0) = f (t1 ). Then the two endpoints have
the same height and the slope of the line connecting the endpoints is zero. What can we say about the
slope between the endpoints? It shouldn’t take much experimentation before you are convinced of the
truth of this statement: Somewhere between t0 and t1 the slope is exactly zero, that is, somewhere between
t0 and t1 the slope is equal to the slope of the line between the endpoints. This suggests that perhaps the
same is true even if the endpoints are at different heights, and again a bit of experimentation will probably
convince you that this is so. But we can do better than “experimentation”—we can prove that this is so.
We start with the simplified version:
Theorem 5.21: Rolle’s Theorem

Suppose that f (x) has a derivative on the interval (a, b), is continuous on the interval [a, b], and
f (a) = f (b). Then at some value c ∈ (a, b), f ′ (c) = 0.
Proof. We know that f (x) has a maximum and minimum value on [a, b] (because it is continuous), and we
also know that the maximum and minimum must occur at an endpoint, at a point at which the derivative is
zero, or at a point where the derivative is undefined. Since the derivative is never undefined, that possibility
is removed.
If the maximum or minimum occurs at a point c, other than an endpoint, where f ′ (c) = 0, then we
have found the point we seek. Otherwise, the maximum and minimum both occur at an endpoint, and
since the endpoints have the same height, the maximum and minimum are the same. This means that
f (x) = f (a) = f (b) at every x ∈ [a, b], so the function is a horizontal line, and it has derivative zero
everywhere in (a, b). Then we may choose any c at all to get f ′ (c) = 0.

Rolle’s Theorem is illustrated below for a function f (x) where f ′ (x) = 0 holds for two values of x = c1

Perhaps remarkably, this special case is all we need to prove the more general one as well.
Theorem 5.22: Mean Value Theorem

Suppose that f (x) has a derivative on the interval (a, b) and is continuous on the interval [a, b]. Then
f (b) − f (a)
at some value c ∈ (a, b), f ′ (c) =
.
b−a
f (b) − f (a)
, and consider a new function g(x) = f (x) − m(x − a) − f (a). We know that
b−a
g(x) has a derivative everywhere, since g′ (x) = f ′ (x) − m. We can compute g(a) = f (a) − m(a − a) −
f (a) = 0 and
Proof. Let m =

g(b) = f (b) − m(b − a) − f (a)

f (b)− f (a)

= f (b) − b−a (b − a) − f (a)
= f (b) − ( f (b) − f (a)) − f (a) = 0.

So the height of g(x) is the same at both endpoints. This means, by Rolle’s Theorem, that at some c,
g′ (c) = 0. But we know that g′ (c) = f ′ (c) − m, so
0 = f ′ (c) − m = f ′ (c) −
which turns into
f ′ (c) =
exactly what we want.

Returning to the original formulation of question (2), we see that if f (t) gives the position of your car
at time t, then the Mean Value Theorem says that at some time c, f ′ (c) = 70, that is, at some time you
must have been traveling at exactly your average speed for the trip, and that indeed you exceeded the speed
limit.
Now let’s return to question (1). Suppose, for example, that two functions are known to have derivative
equal to 5 everywhere, f ′ (x) = g′ (x) = 5. It is easy to find such functions: 5x, 5x + 47, 5x − 132, etc. Are
there other, more complicated, examples? No—the only functions that work are the “obvious” ones,
namely, 5x plus some constant. How can we see that this is true?
Although “5” is a very simple derivative, let’s look at an even simpler one. Suppose that f ′ (x) =
′
g (x) = 0. Again we can find examples: f (x) = 0, f (x) = 47, f (x) = −511 all have f ′ (x) = 0. Are there
non-constant functions f with derivative 0? No, and here’s why: Suppose that f (x) is not a constant
function. This means that there are two points on the function with different heights, say f (a) 6= f (b).
The Mean Value Theorem tells us that at some point c, f ′ (c) = ( f (b) − f (a))/(b − a) 6= 0. So any nonconstant function does not have a derivative that is zero everywhere; this is the same as saying that the
only functions with zero derivative are the constant functions.
Let’s go back to the slightly less easy example: suppose that f ′ (x) = g′ (x) = 5. Then ( f (x) − g(x))′ =
′
f (x) − g′ (x) = 5 − 5 = 0. So using what we discovered in the previous paragraph, we know that f (x) −
g(x) = k, for some constant k. So any two functions with derivative 5 must differ by a constant; since 5x
is known to work, the only other examples must look like 5x + k.
Now we can extend this to more complicated functions, without any extra work. Suppose that f ′ (x) =
g′ (x). Then as before ( f (x) − g(x))′ = f ′ (x) − g′ (x) = 0, so f (x) − g(x) = k. Again this means that if we
find just a single function g(x) with a certain derivative, then every other function with the same derivative
must be of the form g(x) + k.
Example 5.23: Given Derivative

Describe all functions that have derivative 5x − 3.
Solution. It’s easy to find one: g(x) = (5/2)x2 − 3x has g′ (x) = 5x − 3. The only other functions with the
same derivative are therefore of the form f (x) = (5/2)x2 − 3x + k.
Alternately, though not obviously, you might have first noticed that g(x) = (5/2)x2 − 3x + 47 has
g′ (x) = 5x − 3. Then every other function with the same derivative must have the form f (x) = (5/2)x2 −

182

Applications of Derivatives

3x + 47 + k. This looks different, but it really isn’t. The functions of the form f (x) = (5/2)x2 − 3x + k are
exactly the same as the ones of the form f (x) = (5/2)x2 − 3x + 47 + k. For example, (5/2)x2 − 3x + 10 is
the same as (5/2)x2 − 3x + 47 + (−37), and the first is of the first form while the second has the second
form.
♣
This is worth calling a theorem:
Theorem 5.24: Functions with the Same Derivative

If f ′ (x) = g′ (x) for every x ∈ (a, b), then for some constant k, f (x) = g(x) + k on the interval (a, b).

Example 5.25: Same Derivative

Describe all functions with derivative sin x + ex . One such function is − cos x + ex , so all such
functions have the form − cos x + ex + k.
Theorem 5.24 and the above example illustrate what the Mean Value Theorem allows us to say about
f (x) when we have perfect information about f ′ (x). Specifically, f (x) is determined up to a constant. Our
next example illustrates almost the opposite extreme situation, one where we have much less information
about f ′ (x) beyond the fact that f ′ (x) exists. Specifically, assuming that we know an upper bound on the
values of f ′ (x), what can we say about the values of f (x)?
Example 5.26: Conclusion Regarding Function Value Based on Derivative Information

Suppose that f is a differentiable function such that f ′ (x) ≤ 2 for all x. What is the largest possible
value of f (7) if f (3) = 5?
Solution. We are interested in the values of f (x) at x = 3 and x = 7. It makes sense to focus our attention
on the interval between 3 and 7. It is given that f (x) is differentiable for all x. So, f (x) is also continuous
at all x. In particular, f (x) is continuous on the interval [3, 7] and differentiable on the interval (3, 7) . By
the Mean Value Theorem, we know that there is some c in (3, 7) such that
f ′ (c) =

f (7) − f (3)
.
7−3

Simplifying and using the given information f (3) = 5, we get
f ′ (c) =

f (7) − 5
,
4

or, after re-arranging the terms,
f (7) = 4 f ′ (c) + 5.
We do not know the exact value of c, but we do know that f ′ (x) ≤ 2 for all x. This implies that f ′ (c) ≤ 2.
Therefore,
f (7) ≤ 4 · 2 + 5 = 13.

5.3. The Mean Value Theorem

183

That is, the value of f (7) cannot exceed 13. To convince ourselves that 13 (as opposed to some smaller
number) is the largest possible value of f (7) , we still need to show that it is possible for the value of f (7)
to reach 13. If we review our proof, we notice that the inequality will be an equality if f ′ (c) = 2. One
way to guarantee this without knowing anything about c is to require f ′ (x) = 2 for all x. This means that
f (x) = 2x + k for some constant k. From the condition f (3) = 5, we see that k = −1. We can easily verify
that indeed f (x) = 2x − 1 meets all our requirements and f (7) = 13.

5.4 Linear and Higher Order Approximations
When we define the derivative f ′ (x) as the rate of change of f (x) with respect to x, we notice that in
relation to the graph of f , the derivative is the slope of the tangent line, which (loosely speaking) is
the line that just grazes the graph. But what precisely do we mean by this? In short, the tangent line
approximates the graph near the point of contact. The definition of the derivative f ′ (a) guarantees this
when it exists: By taking x sufficiently close to a but not equal to a,
f (x) − f (a)
≈ f ′ (a) ,
x−a
and consequently,
f (x) ≈ f ′ (a) (x − a) + f (a) .

The left hand side gives us the y-value of the function y = f (x) and the right hand side gives us the y-value
y = f ′ (a) (x − a) + f (a) for the tangent line to the graph of f at the point (a, f (a)) .
In this section we will explore how to apply this idea to approximate some values of f , some changes
in the values of f , and also the roots of f .

5.4.1. Linear Approximations
We begin by the first derivative as an application of the tangent line to approximate f .
Recall that the tangent line to f (x) at a point x = a is given by
L(x) = f ′ (a)(x − a) + f (a).
The tangent line in this context is also called the linear approximation to f at a.
If f is differentiable at a then L is a good approximation of f so long as x is “not too far” from a.
Put another way, if f is differentiable at a then under a microscope f will look very much like a straight

5.4. Linear and Higher Order Approximations

185

line, and thus will look very much like L; since L(x) is often much easier to compute than f (x), then it
makes sense to use L as an approximation. Figure 5.8 shows a tangent line to y = x2 at three different
magnifications.

Figure 5.8: The linear approximation to y = x2 .
Thus in practice if we want to approximate a difficult value of f (b), then we may be able to approximate this value using a linear approximation, provided that we can compute the tangent line at some point
a close to b. Here is an example.
Example 5.27: Linear Approximation

Let f (x) = x + 4, what is f (6)?

Solution. We are asked to calculate f (6) = 6 + 4 = 10 which
is not easy to do without a calculator.
√
However 9 is√(relatively) close to 10 and of course f (5) = 9 is easy to compute, and we use this to
approximate 10.
√
To do so we have f ′ (x) = 1/(2 x + 4), and thus the linear approximation to f at x = 5 is

It turns out the exact value of 10 is actually 3.16227766. . . but our estimate of 3.17 was very easy to
obtain and is relatively accurate. This estimate is only accurate to one decimal place.
♣
With modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to use linear approximations, but in fact they are quite useful. For example in cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation,
they allow us to get a quick estimate which can be used as a “reality check” on a more complex calculation.
Further in some complex calculations involving functions, the linear approximation makes an otherwise
intractable calculation possible without serious loss of accuracy.

Applications of Derivatives

Example 5.28: Linear Approximation of Sine

Find the linear approximation of sin x at x = 0, and use it to compute small values of sin x.
Solution. If f (x) = sin x, then f ′ (x) = cos x, and thus the linear approximation of sin x at x = 0 is:
L(x) = cos(0)(x − 0) + sin(0) = x.
Thus when x is small this is quite a good approximation and is used frequently by engineers and scientists
to simplify some calculations.
For example you can use your calculator (in radian mode since the derivative of sin x is cos x only in
radian) to see that
sin(0.1) = 0.099833416 . . .
and thus L(0.1) = 0.1 is a very good and quick approximation without any calculator!

approximate 3 9 by choosing an appropriate point x = a. Are we

5.4.2. Differentials
Very much related to linear approximations are the differentials dx and dy, used not to approximate values
of f , but instead the change (or rise) in the values of f .
Definition 5.29: Differentials dx and dy

Let y = f (x) be a differentiable function. We define a new independent variable dx, and a new
dependent variable dy = f ′ (x) dx. Notice that dy is a function both of x (since f ′ (x) is a function of
x) and of dx. We call both dx and dy differentials.
Now fix a point a and let ∆x = x − a and ∆y = f (x) − f (a). If x is near a then ∆x is clearly small. If
we set dx = ∆x then we obtain
∆y
dy = f ′ (a) dx ≈ ∆x = ∆y.
∆x

5.4. Linear and Higher Order Approximations

Thus, dy can be used to approximate ∆y, the actual change in the function f between a and x. This is
exactly the approximation given by the tangent line:
dy = f ′ (a)(x − a) = f ′ (a)(x − a) + f (a) − f (a) = L(x) − f (a).
While L(x) approximates f (x), dy approximates how f (x) has changed from f (a). Figure 5.9 illustrates
the relationships.

Here is a concrete example.
Example 5.30: Rise of Natural Logarithm

Approximate the rise of f (x) = ln x from x = 1 to x = 1.1, using linear approximation.
Solution. Note that ln(1.1) is not readily calculated (without a calculator) hence why we wish to use linear
approximation to approximate f (1.1) − f (1).
We fix a = 1 and as above we have ∆x = x − 1 and ∆y = f (x) − f (1) = ln x, and obtain
dy = f ′ (1)dx ≈

∆y
∆x = ∆y.
∆x

But f ′ (x) = 1/x and thus f ′ (1) = 1/1 = 1, we obtain in this case
dy = dx ≈ ∆y.
Finally for x = 1.1, we can easily approximate the rise of f as
f (1.1) − f (1) = ∆y ≈ dy = 1.1 − 1 = 0.1.
The correct value of ln(1.1) = ln 1 is 0.0953. . . and thus we were relatively close.

thick to a sphere with diameter 40 meters. (Recall that the volume of a sphere of radius r is V = (4/3)π r3.
Notice that you are given that dr = 0.02.)

5.4.3. Taylor Polynomials
We can go beyond first order derivatives to create polynomials approximating a function as closely as we
wish, these are called Taylor Polynomials.
While our linear approximation L(x) = f ′ (a)(x − a) + f (a) at a point a was a polynomial of degree 1
such that both L(a) = f (a) and L′ (a) = f ′ (a), we can now form a polynomial
Tn (x) = a0 + a1 (x − a) + a2 (x − a)2 + a3 (x − a)3 + · · · + an (x − a)n
which has the same first n derivatives at x = a as the function f .
By successively computing the derivatives of Tn , we obtain:
a0 = f (a) =
′
a1 = f 1!(a)
f ′′ (a)
a2 = 2!
···

f (a)
0!

f (k) (a)
k!
(n)
· · · an = f n!(a)

ak =

where f (k) (x) is the kth derivative of f (x), and n! = n(n − 1)(n − 2) . . .(2)(1), referred to as factorial
notation.
Here is an example.
Example 5.31: Approximate e using Taylor Polynomials

Approximate ex using Taylor polynomials at a = 0, and use this to approximate e.
Solution. In this case we use the function f (x) = ex at a = 0, and therefore
Tn (x) = a0 + a1 x + ax x2 + a3 x3 + . . . + an xn

5.4. Linear and Higher Order Approximations

Since all derivatives f (k) (x) = ex , we get:
a0 = f (0) = 1
f ′ (0)
a1 = 1! = 1
′′
a2 = f 2!(0) = 2!1

T8 (1) = 2.71825396825
T20 (1) = 2.71828182845
We can continue this way for larger values of n, but T20 (1) is already a pretty good approximation of
e, and we took only 20 terms!

5.4.4. Newton’s Method
A well known numeric method is Newton’s Method (also sometimes referred to as Newton-Raphson’s
Method), named after Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson. This method is used to find roots, or x-intercepts,
of a function. While we may be able to find the roots of a polynomial which we can easily factor, we saw
in the previous chapter on Limits, that for example the function ex + x = 0 has a solution (i.e. root, or
x-intercept) at x ≈ −0.56714. By the Intermediate Value Theorem we know that the function ex + x = 0
does have a solution. We cannot here simply solve for such a root algebraically, but we can use a numerical
method such as Newton′s. Such a process is typically classified as an iterative method, a name given to
a technique which involves repeating similar steps until the desired accuracy is obtained. Many computer
algorithms are coded with a for-loop, repeating an iterative step to converge to a solution.
The idea is to start with an initial value x0 (approximating the root), and use linear approximation to
create values x1 , x2 , · · · getting closer and closer to a root.
The first value x1 corresponds to the intercept of the tangent line of f (x0 ) with the x-axis, which is:
x1 = x0 −

f (x0 )
f ′ (x0 )

y

f(x0)

Figure 5.10: First iteration of Newton’s Method.
We can see in Figure 5.10, that if we compare the point (x0 , 0) to (x1 , 0), we would likely come to
the conclusion that (x1 , 0) is closer to the actual root of f (x) than our original guess, (x0 , 0). As will be

5.4. Linear and Higher Order Approximations

191

discussed, the choice of x0 must be done correctly, and it may occur that x1 does not yield a better estimate
of the root.
Newton’s method is simply to repeat this process again and again in an effort to obtain a more accurate
solution. Thus at the next step we obtain:
x2 = x1 −

f (x1 )
f ′ (x1 )

y

f(x1)

Figure 5.11: Second iteration of Newton’s Method.
We can now clearly see how (x2 , 0) is a better estimate of the root of f (x), rather than any of the
previous points. Moving forward, we will get:
x3 = x2 −

f (x2 )
f ′ (x2 )

Rest assured, (x3 , 0) will be an even better estimate of the root! We express the general iterative step as:
xn+1 = xn −

f (xn )
f ′ (xn )

The idea is to iterate these steps to obtain the desired accuracy. Here is an example.
Example 5.32: Newton method to approximate roots

Use Newton’s method to approximate the roots of f (x) = x3 − x + 1.
Solution. You can try to find solve the equation algebraically to see that this is a difficult task, and thus it
make sense to try a numerical method such as Newton’s.
To find an initial value x0 , note that f (−1) = −5 and f (0) = 1, and by the Intermediate Value Theorem
this f has a root between these two values, and we decide to start with x0 = −1 (you can try other values
to see what happens).

x3 = −1.325200..
x4 = −1.324718..
x5 = −1.324717..
x6 = −1.324717..
···
and we can now approximate the root as −1.324717.

As with any numerical method, we need to be aware of the weaknesses of any technique we are using.

Figure 5.12: Function with three distinct solutions.
If we know our root is somewhere near a, we would make our guess x0 = a. Generally speaking, a
good practice is to make our guess as close to the actual root as possible. In some cases we may have no
idea where the root is, so it would be prudent to perform the algorithm several times on several different
initial guesses and analyze the results.
For example we can see in Figure 5.12 that f (x) in fact has three roots, and depending on our initial
guess, we may get the algorithm to converge to different roots. If we did not know where the roots were,
we would try the technique several times. In one instance, if our initial guess was xa , we’d likely converge
to (a, 0). Then if we were to choose another guess, xb , then we’d likely converge to (b, 0). Eventually,
using various initial guesses we’d get one of three roots: a, b, or c. Under these circumstances we can
clearly see the effectiveness of this numeric method.

Figure 5.13: Newton’s Method applied to sin x.
As another example if we attempt to use Newton′ s Method on f (x) = sin x using x0 = π /2, then
f ′ (x0 ) = 0 so x1 is undefined and we cannot proceed. Even in general xn+1 is typically nowhere near xn ,
and in general not converging to the root nearest to our initial guess of x0 . In effect, the algorithm keeps
"bouncing around". An example of which is depicted in Figure 5.13. Based on our initial guess for such
a function, the algorithm may or may not converge to a root, or it may or may not converge to the root
closest to the initial guess. This gives rise to the more common issue: Selection of the initial guess, x0 .
Here is a summary.
Key Points in using Newton’s method to approximate a root of f (x)
1. Choosing x0 as close as possible to the root we wish to find.
2. A guess for x0 which makes the algorithm “bounce around” is considered unstable.
3. Even the smallest changes to x0 can have drastic effects: We may converge to another root, we may
converge very slowly (requiring many more iterations), or we may encounter an unstable point.
4. We may encounter a stationary point if we choose x0 such that f ′ (x) = 0 (i.e. at a critical point!) in
which case the algorithm fails.
This is all to say that your initial guess for x0 can be extremely important.

f (x) → ±∞ and g (x) → ±∞ as x → a (Here, the two ± signs are independent of each other).

This theorem is somewhat difficult to prove, in part because it incorporates so many different possibilities, so we will not prove it here.
We should also note that there may be instances where we would need to apply L’Hôpital’s Rule
′ (x)
multiple times, but we must confirm that limx→a gf ′ (x)
is still indeterminate before we attempt to apply
L’Hôpital’s Rule again. Finally, we want to mention that L’Hôpital’s rule is also valid for one-sided limits
and limits at infinity.
Example 5.35: L’Hôpital’s Rule
x2 − π 2
.
x→π sin x

Compute lim

Solution. We use L’Hôpital’s Rule: Since the numerator and denominator both approach zero,
x2 − π 2

♣
Example 5.36: L’Hôpital’s Rule
2x2 − 3x + 7
.
x→∞ x2 + 47x + 1

Compute lim

Solution. As x goes to infinity, both the numerator and denominator go to infinity, so we may apply
L’Hôpital’s Rule:
2x2 − 3x + 7
4x − 3
lim 2
= lim
.
x→∞ x + 47x + 1
x→∞ 2x + 47
In the second quotient, it is still the case that the numerator and denominator both go to infinity, so we are
allowed to use L’Hôpital’s Rule again:
4
4x − 3
= lim = 2.
x→∞ 2x + 47
x→∞ 2
lim

So the original limit is 2 as well.

Example 5.37: L’Hôpital’s Rule

♣
L’Hôpital’s rule concerns limits of a quotient that are indeterminate forms. But not all functions are
given in the form of a quotient. But all the same, nothing prevents us from re-writing a given function
in the form of a quotient. Indeed, some functions whose given form involve either a product f (x) g (x)
or a power f (x)g(x) carry indeterminacies such as 0 · ±∞ and 1±∞ . Something small times something
numerically large (positive or negative) could be anything. It depends on how small and how large each
piece turns out to be. A number close to 1 raised to a numerically large (positive or negative) power could
be anything. It depends on how close to 1 the base is, whether the base is larger than or smaller than 1,
and how large the exponent is (and its sign). We can use suitable algebraic manipulations to relate them to
indeterminate quotients. We will illustrate with two examples, first a product and then a power.

196

Applications of Derivatives

Example 5.38: L’Hôpital’s Rule

Compute lim+ x ln x.
x→0

Solution. This doesn’t appear to be suitable for L’Hôpital’s Rule, but it also is not “obvious”. As x
approaches zero, ln x goes to −∞, so the product looks like:
(something very small) · (something very large and negative).
This could be anything: it depends on how small and how large each piece of the function turns out to be.
As defined earlier, this is a type of ±“0 · ∞”, which is indeterminate. So we can in fact apply L’Hôpital’s
Rule after re-writing it in the form ∞
∞:
ln x
ln x
x ln x =
= −1 .
1/x x
Now as x approaches zero, both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (one −∞ and one +∞,
but only the size is important). Using L’Hôpital’s Rule:
ln x

= lim
= lim (−x2 ) = lim −x = 0.

x→0 x

One way to interpret this is that since lim x ln x = 0, the x approaches zero much faster than the ln x
lim

x→0+

x→0+

approaches −∞.

Finally, we illustrate how a limit of the type “1∞ ” can be indeterminate.

♣

Example 5.39: L’Hôpital’s Rule

Evaluate lim+ x1/(x−1) .
x→1

Solution. Plugging in x = 1 (from the right) gives a limit of the type “1∞ ”. To deal with this type of limit
we will use logarithms. Let
L = lim x1/(x−1) .
x→1+

Now, take the natural log of both sides:


ln L = lim ln x1/(x−1) .
x→1+

Using log properties we have:

ln x
.
x−1
The right side limit is now of the type 0/0, therefore, we can apply L’Hôpital’s Rule:
ln L = lim

x→1+

ln x
1/x
= lim
=1
x→1+ x − 1
x→1+ 1

ln L = lim

Thus, ln L = 1 and hence, our original limit (denoted by L) is: L = e1 = e. That is,
L = lim x1/(x−1) = e.
In this case, even though our limit had a type

x→1+
of “1∞ ”,

it actually had a value of e.

5.6 Curve Sketching
In this section, we discuss how we can tell what the graph of a function looks like by performing simple
tests on its derivatives.

5.6.1. Intervals of Increase/Decrease, and the First Derivative Test
The method of Section 5.2.1 for deciding whether there is a local maximum or minimum at a critical value
is not always convenient. We can instead use information about the derivative f ′ (x) to decide; since we
have already had to compute the derivative to find the critical values, there is often relatively little extra
work involved in this method.
How can the derivative tell us whether there is a maximum, minimum, or neither at a point? Suppose
that f is differentiable at and around x = a, and suppose further that a is a critical point of f . Then we
have several possibilities:
1. There is a local maximum at x = a. This happens if f ′ (x) > 0 as we approach x = a from the left
(i.e. when x is in the vicinity of a, and x < a) and f ′ (x) < 0 as we move to the right of x = a (i.e.
when x is in the vicinity of a, and x > a).
2. There is a local minimum at x = a. This happens if f ′ (x) < 0 as we approach x = a from the left
(i.e. when x is in the vicinity of a, and x < a) and f ′ (x) > 0 as we move to the right of x = a (i.e.
when x is in the vicinity of a, and x > a).
3. There is neither a local maximum or local minimum at x = a. If f ′ (x) does not change from negative
to positive, or from positive to negative, as we move from the left of x = a to the right of x = a (that
is, f ′ (x) is positive on both sides of x = a, or negative on both sides of x = a) then there is neither a
maximum nor minimum when x = a.
See the first graph in Figure 5.5 and the graph in Figure 5.6 for examples.
Example 5.40: Local Maximum and Minimum

Find all local maximum and minimum points for f (x) = sin x + cos x using the first derivative test.
Solution. The derivative is f ′ (x) = cos x − sin x and from Example 5.10 the critical values we need to
consider are π /4 and 5π /4.
We analyze the graphs of sin x and cos x. Just to the left of π /4 the cosine is larger than the sine, so
f ′ (x) is positive; just to the right the cosine is smaller than the sine, so f ′ (x) is negative. This means there
is a local maximum at π /4. Just to the left of 5π /4 the cosine is smaller than the sine, and to the right the
cosine is larger than the sine. This means that the derivative f ′ (x) is negative to the left and positive to the
right, so f has a local minimum at 5π /4.
♣
The above observations have obvious intuitive appeal as you examine the graphs in Figures 5.5 and
5.6. We can extend these ideas further and then formulate and prove a theorem: If the graph of f is
increasing before (i.e., to the left of) x = a and decreasing after (i.e., to the right of) x = a, then there is

200

Applications of Derivatives

a local maximum at x = a. If the graph of f is decreasing before x = a and increasing after x = a, then
there is a local minimum at x = a. If the graph of f is consistently increasing on either side of x = a or
consistently decreasing on either side of x = a, then there is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum
at x = a. We can prove the following theorem using the Mean Value Theorem.
Theorem 5.41: Intervals of Increase and Decrease

If f ′ (x) > 0 for every x in an interval, then f is increasing on that interval.
If f ′ (x) < 0 for every x in an interval, then f is decreasing on that interval.
Proof. We will prove the increasing case. The proof of the decreasing case is similar. Suppose that
f ′ (x) > 0 on an interval I. Then f is differentiable, and hence also, continuous on I. If x1 and x2 are any
two numbers in I and x1 < x2 , then f is continuous on [x1 , x2 ] and differentiable on (x1 , x2 ) . By the Mean
Value Theorem, there is some c in (x1 , x2 ) such that
f ′ (c) =

f (x2 ) − f (x1 )
.
x2 − x1

But c must be in I, and thus, since f ′ (x) > 0 for every x in I, f ′ (c) > 0. Also, since x1 < x2 , we have
x2 − x1 > 0. Therefore, both the left hand side and the denominator of the right hand side are positive.
It follows that the numerator of the right hand must be positive. That is, f (x2 ) − f (x1 ) > 0, or in other
words, f (x1 ) < f (x2 ) . This shows that between x1 and x2 in I, the larger one, x2 , necessarily has the larger
function value, f (x2 ) , and the smaller one, x1 , necessarily have the smaller function value, f (x1 ) . This
means that f is increasing on I.
♣
Example 5.42: Local Minimum and Maximum

Consider the function f (x) = x4 − 2x2 . Find where f is increasing and where f is decreasing. Use
this information to find the local maximum and minimum points of f .
Solution. We compute f ′ (x) and analyze its sign.

f ′ (x) = 4x3 − 4x = 4x x2 − 1 = 4x (x − 1) (x + 1) .

The solution of the inequality f ′ (x) > 0 is (−1, 0) ∪ (1, ∞). So, f is increasing on the interval (−1, 0) and
on the interval (1, ∞) . The solution of the inequality f ′ (x) < 0 is (−∞, −1) ∪ (0, 1) . So, f is decreasing on
the interval (−∞, −1) and on the interval (0, 1) . Therefore, at the critical points −1, 0 and 1, respectively,
♣
f has a local minimum, a local maximum and a local minimum.

It is possible to see this without using calculus at all; explain.

5.6.2. The Second Derivative Test
The basis of the first derivative test is that if the derivative changes from positive to negative at a point at
which the derivative is zero then there is a local maximum at the point, and similarly for a local minimum.
If f ′ changes from positive to negative it is decreasing; this means that the derivative of f ′ , f ′′ , might be
negative, and if in fact f ′′ is negative then f ′ is definitely decreasing. From this we determine that there is
a local maximum at the point in question. Note that f ′ might change from positive to negative while f ′′
is zero, in which case f ′′ gives us no information about the critical value. Similarly, if f ′ changes from
negative to positive there is a local minimum at the point, and f ′ is increasing. If f ′′ > 0 at the point, this
tells us that f ′ is increasing, and so there is a local minimum.

Example 5.43: Second Derivative

′′
♣
f (5π /4) = −(− 2/2) − (− 2/2) = 2 > 0, there is a local minimum at 5π /4.
When it works, the second derivative test is often the easiest way to identify local maximum and minimum points. Sometimes the test fails, and sometimes the second derivative is quite difficult to evaluate;
in such cases we must fall back on one of the previous tests.
Example 5.44: Second Derivative

Let f (x) = x4 and g(x) = −x4 . Classify the critical points of f (x) and g(x) as either maximum or
minimum.
Solution. The derivatives for f (x) are f ′ (x) = 4x3 and f ′′ (x) = 12x2 . Zero is the only critical value, but
f ′′ (0) = 0, so the second derivative test tells us nothing. However, f (x) is positive everywhere except at
zero, so clearly f (x) has a local minimum at zero.
On the other hand, for g(x) = −x4 , g′ (x) = −4x3 and g′′ (x) = −12x2 . So g(x) also has zero as its only
only critical value, and the second derivative is again zero, but −x4 has a local maximum at zero.

5.6.3. Concavity and Inflection Points
We know that the sign of the derivative tells us whether a function is increasing or decreasing; for example,
when f ′ (x) > 0, f (x) is increasing. The sign of the second derivative f ′′ (x) tells us whether f ′ is increasing
or decreasing; we have seen that if f ′ is zero and increasing at a point then there is a local minimum at the
point. If f ′ is zero and decreasing at a point then there is a local maximum at the point. Thus, we extracted
information about f from information about f ′′ .
We can get information from the sign of f ′′ even when f ′ is not zero. Suppose that f ′′ (a) > 0. This
means that near x = a, f ′ is increasing. If f ′ (a) > 0, this means that f slopes up and is getting steeper;
if f ′ (a) < 0, this means that f slopes down and is getting less steep. The two situations are shown in
figure 5.14. A curve that is shaped like this is called concave up.

Figure 5.14: f ′′ (a) > 0: f ′ (a) positive and increasing, f ′ (a) negative and increasing.
Now suppose that f ′′ (a) < 0. This means that near x = a, f ′ is decreasing. If f ′ (a) > 0, this means
that f slopes up and is getting less steep; if f ′ (a) < 0, this means that f slopes down and is getting steeper.
The two situations are shown in figure 5.15. A curve that is shaped like this is called concave down.

Figure 5.15: f ′′ (a) < 0: f ′ (a) positive and decreasing, f ′ (a) negative and decreasing.
If we are trying to understand the shape of the graph of a function, knowing where it is concave up
and concave down helps us to get a more accurate picture. Of particular interest are points at which
the concavity changes from up to down or down to up; such points are called inflection points. If the
concavity changes from up to down at x = a, f ′′ changes from positive to the left of a to negative to the
right of a, and usually f ′′ (a) = 0. We can identify such points by first finding where f ′′ (x) is zero and then
checking to see whether f ′′ (x) does in fact go from positive to negative or negative to positive at these
points. Note that it is possible that f ′′ (a) = 0 but the concavity is the same on both sides; f (x) = x4 at
x = 0 is an example.
Example 5.45: Concavity

Describe the concavity of f (x) = x3 − x.
Solution. The derivatives are f ′ (x) = 3x2 − 1 and f ′′ (x) = 6x. Since f ′′ (0) = 0, there is potentially an
inflection point at zero. Since f ′′ (x) > 0 when x > 0 and f ′′ (x) < 0 when x < 0 the concavity does change
from concave down to concave up at zero, and the curve is concave down for all x < 0 and concave up for
♣
all x > 0.
Note that we need to compute and analyze the second derivative to understand concavity, so we may
as well try to use the second derivative test for maxima and minima. If for some reason this fails we can
then try one of the other tests.

5.6.4. Asymptotes and Other Things to Look For
A vertical asymptote is a place where the function becomes infinite, typically because the formula for
the function has a denominator that becomes zero. For example, the reciprocal function f (x) = 1/x has
a vertical asymptote at x = 0, and the function tan x has a vertical asymptote at x = π /2 (and also at
x = −π /2, x = 3π /2, etc.). Whenever the formula for a function contains a denominator it is worth
looking for a vertical asymptote by checking to see if the denominator can ever be zero, and then checking

206

Applications of Derivatives

the limit at such points. Note that there is not always a vertical asymptote where the derivative is zero:
f (x) = (sin x)/x has a zero denominator at x = 0, but since lim (sin x)/x = 1 there is no asymptote there.
x→0

A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line to which f (x) gets closer and closer as x approaches ∞
(or as x approaches −∞). For example, the reciprocal function has the x-axis for a horizontal asymptote.
Horizontal asymptotes can be identified by computing the limits lim f (x) and lim f (x). Since lim 1/x =
x→∞

x→−∞

x→∞

lim 1/x = 0, the line y = 0 (that is, the x-axis) is a horizontal asymptote in both directions.

x→−∞

Some functions have asymptotes that are neither horizontal nor vertical, but some other line. Such
asymptotes are somewhat more difficult to identify and we will ignore them.
If the domain of the function does not extend out to infinity, we should also ask
p what happens as x
approaches the boundary of the domain. For example, the function y = f (x) = 1/ r2 − x2 has domain
−r < x < r, and y becomes infinite as x approaches either r or −r. In this case we might also identify this
behavior because when x = ±r the denominator of the function is zero.
If there are any points where the derivative fails to exist (a cusp or corner), then we should take special
note of what the function does at such a point.
Finally, it is worthwhile to notice any symmetry. A function f (x) that has the same value for −x as
for x, i.e., f (−x) = f (x), is called an “even function.” Its graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.
Some examples of even functions are: xn when n is an even number, cos x, and sin2 x. On the other hand,
a function that satisfies the property f (−x) = − f (x) is called an “odd function.” Its graph is symmetric
with respect to the origin. Some examples of odd functions are: xn when n is an odd number, sin x, and
tan x. Of course, most functions are neither even nor odd, and do not have any particular symmetry.

5.6.5. Summary of Curve Sketching
The following is a guideline for sketching a curve y = f (x) by hand. Each item may not be relevant to
the function in question, but utilizing this guideline will provide all information needed to make a detailed

Note that f ′ (x) = 0 when x = 0 (the top is zero). Also, f ′ (x) = DNE when x = ±1 (the bottom is
zero). As x = ±1 is not in the domain of f (x), the only critical number is x = 0 (recall that to be a
critical number we need it to be in the domain of the original function).
Drawing a number line and including all of the split points of f ′ (x) we have:
f '(‐2) > 0

f '(‐0.5) > 0

f '(0.5) < 0

f '(2) < 0

Thus f is increasing on (−∞, −1) ∪ (−1, 0) and decreasing on (0, 1) ∪ (1, ∞).

6. For possible inflection points we take the second derivative:
f ′′ (x) =

12x2 + 4
(x2 − 1)3

The top is never zero. Also, the bottom is only zero when x = ±1 (neither of which are in the domain
of f (x)). Thus, there are no possible inflection points to consider.

5.7 Optimization Problems
Many important applied problems involve finding the best way to accomplish some task. Often this involves finding the maximum or minimum value of some function: the minimum time to make a certain
journey, the minimum cost for doing a task, the maximum power that can be generated by a device, and so
on. Many of these problems can be solved by finding the appropriate function and then using techniques
of calculus to find the maximum or the minimum value required.
Generally such a problem will have the following mathematical form: Find the largest (or smallest)
value of f (x) when a ≤ x ≤ b. Sometimes a or b are infinite, but frequently the real world imposes some
constraint on the values that x may have.
Such a problem differs in two ways from the local maximum and minimum problems we encountered
when graphing functions: We are interested only in the function between a and b, and we want to know
the largest or smallest value that f (x) takes on, not merely values that are the largest or smallest in a
small interval. That is, we seek not a local maximum or minimum but a global (or absolute) maximum or
minimum.
Guidelines to solving an optimization problem.
1. Understand clearly what is to be maximized or minimized and what the contraints are.
2. Draw a diagram (if appropriate) and label it.
3. Decide what the variables are. For example, A for area, r for radius, C for cost.
4. Write a formula for the function for which you wish to find the maximum or minimum.
5. Express that formula in terms of only one variable, that is, in the form f (x). Usually this is
accomplished by using the given constraints.
6. Set f ′ (x) = 0 and solve. Check all critical values and endpoints to determine the extreme
value(s) of f (x).

Example 5.47: Largest Rectangle

Find the largest rectangle (that is, the rectangle with largest area) that fits inside the graph of the
parabola y = x2 below the line y = a (a is an unspecified constant value), with the top side of the
rectangle on the horizontal line y = a; see Figure 5.16.)
Solution. We want to find the maximum value of some function A(x) representing area. Perhaps the
hardest part of this problem is deciding what x should represent. The lower right corner of the rectangle is
at (x, x2 ), and once this is chosen the rectangle is completely determined. So we can let the x in A(x) be
the x of the parabola f (x) = x2 . Then the area is
A(x) = (2x)(a − x2 ) = −2x3 + 2ax.

5.7. Optimization Problems

√
√
We want the maximum value of A(x) when x is in [0, a]. (You might object to allowing x = 0 or x = a,
since then the “rectangle” has either no width or no height, so is not “really” a rectangle. But the problem
is somewhat easier if we simply allow such rectangles, which have zero area.)
p
Setting 0 = A′ (x) = 6x2 + 2a we get x = pa/3 as the only√critical value. Testing this and the two
√
endpoints, we have A(0) = A( a) =p0 and A( a/3) = (4/9) 3a3/2 . The maximum area thus occurs

Example 5.48: Largest Cone

If you fit the largest possible cone inside a sphere, what fraction of the volume of the sphere is
occupied by the cone? (Here by “cone” we mean a right circular cone, i.e., a cone for which the
base is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry, and for which the cross-section cut perpendicular to
the axis of symmetry at any point is a circle.)
Solution. Let R be the radius of the sphere, and let r and h be the base radius and height of the cone inside
the sphere. What we want to maximize is the volume of the cone: π r2 h/3. Here R is a fixed value, but r
and h can vary. Namely, we could choose r to be as large as possible—equal to R—by taking the height
equal to R; or we could make the cone’s height h larger at the expense of making r a little less than R. See
the cross-section depicted in Figure 5.17. We have situated the picture in a convenient way relative to the
x and y axes, namely, with the center of the sphere at the origin and the vertex of the cone at the far left on
the x-axis.
Notice that the function we want to maximize, π r2 h/3, depends on two variables. This is frequently
the case, but often the two variables are related in some way so that “really” there is only one variable. So
our next step is to find the relationship and use it to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other, so
as to have a function of only one variable to maximize. In this problem, the condition is apparent in the
figure: the upper corner of the triangle, whose coordinates are (h − R, r), must be on the circle of radius R.
That is,
(h − R)2 + r2 = R2 .
We can solve for h in terms of r or for r in terms of h. Either involves taking a square root, but we notice that
the volume function contains r2 , not r by itself, so it is easiest to solve for r2 directly: r2 = R2 − (h − R)2 .

212

Applications of Derivatives

Then we substitute the result into π r2 h/3:
V (h) = π (R2 − (h − R)2 )h/3
= − π3 h3 + 23 π h2 R
We want to maximize V (h) when h is between 0 and 2R. Now we solve 0 = f ′ (h) = −π h2 + (4/3)π hR,
getting h = 0 or h = 4R/3. We compute V (0) = V (2R) = 0 and V (4R/3) = (32/81)π R3. The maximum
is the latter; since the volume of the sphere is (4/3)π R3, the fraction of the sphere occupied by the cone is

(32/81)π R3

≈ 30%.

Example 5.49: Containers of Given Volume

You are making cylindrical containers to contain a given volume. Suppose that the top and bottom
are made of a material that is N times as expensive (cost per unit area) as the material used for the
lateral side of the cylinder.
Find (in terms of N ) the ratio of height to base radius of the cylinder that minimizes the cost of
making the containers.
Solution. Let us first choose letters to represent various things: h for the height, r for the base radius, V
for the volume of the cylinder, and c for the cost per unit area of the lateral side of the cylinder; V and c
are constants, h and r are variables. Now we can write the cost of materials:
c(2π rh) + Nc(2π r2).
Again we have two variables; the relationship is provided by the fixed volume of the cylinder: V = π r2 h.
We use this relationship to eliminate h (we could eliminate r, but it’s a little easier if we eliminate h, which
appears in only one place in the above formula for cost). The result is
f (r) = 2cπ r

We want to know the minimum
value of this function when r is in (0, ∞). We now set 0 = f ′ (r) =
p
−2cV /r2 + 4Ncπ r, giving r = 3 V /(2N π ). Since f ′′ (r) = 4cV /r3 + 4Ncπ is positive when r is positive,
there is a local minimum at the critical value, and hence a global minimum since there is only one critical
value.
Finally, since h = V /(π r2),
V
V
h
= 3=
= 2N,
r πr
π (V /(2N π ))
so the minimum cost occurs when the height h is 2N times the radius. If, for example, there is no difference
in the cost of materials, the height is twice the radius (or the height is equal to the diameter).
♣
Example 5.50: Rectangles of Given Area

Of all rectangles of area 100, which has the smallest perimeter?
Solution. First we must translate this into a purely mathematical problem in which we want to find the
minimum value of a function. If x denotes one of the sides of the rectangle, then the adjacent side must be
100/x (in order that the area be 100). So the function we want to minimize is
f (x) = 2x + 2

100
x

since the perimeter is twice the length plus twice the width of the rectangle. Not all values of x make sense
in this problem: lengths of sides of rectangles must be positive, so x > 0. If x > 0 then so is 100/x, so we
need no second condition on x.
We next find f ′ (x) and set it equal to zero: 0 = f ′ (x) = 2 − 200/x2 . Solving f ′ (x) = 0 for x gives us
x = ±10. We are interested only in x > 0, so only the value x = 10 is of interest. Since f ′ (x) is defined
everywhere on the interval (0, ∞), there are no more critical values, and there are no endpoints. Is there a
local maximum, minimum, or neither at x = 10? The second derivative is f ′′ (x) = 400/x3 , and f ′′ (10) > 0,
so there is a local minimum. Since there is only one critical value, this is also the global minimum, so the
rectangle with smallest perimeter is the 10 × 10 square.

Example 5.51: Maximize your Profit

You want to sell a certain number n of items in order to maximize your profit. Market research tells
you that if you set the price at $1.50, you will be able to sell 5000 items, and for every 10 cents you
lower the price below $1.50 you will be able to sell another 1000 items. Suppose that your fixed
costs (“start-up costs”) total $2000, and the per item cost of production (“marginal cost”) is $0.50.
Find the price to set per item and the number of items sold in order to maximize profit, and also
determine the maximum profit you can get.
Solution. The first step is to convert the problem into a function maximization problem. Since we want
to maximize profit by setting the price per item, we should look for a function P(x) representing the profit
when the price per item is x. Profit is revenue minus costs, and revenue is number of items sold times
the price per item, so we get P = nx − 2000 − 0.50n. The number of items sold is itself a function of x,

214

Applications of Derivatives

n = 5000 + 1000(1.5 − x)/0.10, because (1.5 − x)/0.10 is the number of multiples of 10 cents that the
price is below $1.50. Now we substitute for n in the profit function:
P(x) = (5000 + 1000(1.5 − x)/0.10)x − 2000 − 0.5(5000 + 1000(1.5 − x)/0.10)
= −10000x2 + 25000x − 12000
We want to know the maximum value of this function when x is between 0 and 1.5. The derivative is
P′ (x) = −20000x + 25000, which is zero when x = 1.25. Since P′′ (x) = −20000 < 0, there must be a
local maximum at x = 1.25, and since this is the only critical value it must be a global maximum as well.
(Alternately, we could compute P(0) = −12000, P(1.25) = 3625, and P(1.5) = 3000 and note that P(1.25)
is the maximum of these.) Thus the maximum profit is $3625, attained when we set the price at $1.25 and
♣
sell 7500 items.
Example 5.52: Minimize Travel Time

Suppose you want to reach a point A that is located across the sand from a nearby road (see Figure 5.18). Suppose that the road is straight, and b is the distance from A to the closest point C on
the road. Let v be your speed on the road, and let w, which is less than v, be your speed on the sand.
Right now you are at the point D, which is a distance a from C. At what point B should you turn off
the road and head across the sand in order to minimize your travel time to A?
Solution. Let x be the distance short of C where you turn off, i.e., the distance from B to C. We want to
minimize the total travel time. Recall that when traveling at constant velocity, time is distance divided by
velocity.
You travel the distance DB atpspeed v, and then the distance BA at speed w. Since DB = a − x and, by
the Pythagorean theorem, BA = x2 + b2 , the total time for the trip is
√
a−x
x2 + b2
f (x) =

.
v
w
We want to find the minimum value of f when x is between 0 and a. As usual we set f ′ (x) = 0 and solve
for x:
1

0 = f ′ (x) = − + √
2

p
w x2 + b2 = vx
w2 (x2 + b2 ) = v2 x2
w2 b2 = (v2 − w2 )x2
wb
x= √
v2 − w2
Notice that a does not appear in the last p
expression, but a is not irrelevant, since we are interested only in
critical values that are in [0, a], and wb/ v2 − w2 is either in this interval or not. If it is, we can use the
second derivative to test it:
b2
′′
f (x) = 2
.
(x + b2 )3/2 w

5.7. Optimization Problems

215

Since this is always positive there is a local minimum at the critical point, and so it is a global minimum
as well.
If the critical value is not in [0, a] it is larger than a. In this case the minimum must occur at one of the
endpoints. We can compute
a b
+
v w
√
a2 + b2
f (a) =
w
f (0)

=

but it is difficult to determine which of these is smaller by direct comparison. If, as is likely in practice,
we know the values of v, w, a, and b, then it is easy to determine this. With a little cleverness, however, we
can determine the minimum in general. Wephave seen that f ′′ (x) is always positive, so the derivative f ′ (x)
is always increasing. We know that at wb/ v2 − w2 the derivative is zero, so for values of x less than that
critical value, the derivative is negative. This means that f (0) > f (a), so the minimum occurs when x = a.
p
So the upshot is this: If you start farther away
from
C
than
wb/
v2 − w2 then you always want to cut
p
across the sand when you are a distance wb/ v2 − w2 from point C. If you start closer than this to C, you
should cut directly across the sand.

6. Integration
6.1 Displacement and Area
Example 6.1: Object Moving in a Straight Line

An object moves in a straight line so that its speed at time t is given by v(t) = 3t in, say, cm/sec. If
the object is at position 10 on the straight line when t = 0, where is the object at any time t ?
Solution. There are two reasonable ways to approach this problem. If s(t) is the position of the object
at time t, we know that s′ (t) = v(t). Based on our knowledge of derivatives, we therefore know that
s(t) = 3t 2 /2 + k, and because s(0) = 10 we easily discover that k = 10, so s(t) = 3t 2/2 + 10. For example,
at t = 1 the object is at position 3/2 +10 = 11.5. This is certainly the easiest way to deal with this problem.
Not all similar problems are so easy, as we will see; the second approach to the problem is more difficult
but also more general.
We start by considering how we might approximate a solution. We know that at t = 0 the object is at
position 10. How might we approximate its position at, say, t = 1? We know that the speed of the object at
time t = 0 is 0; if its speed were constant then in the first second the object would not move and its position
would still be 10 when t = 1. In fact, the object will not be too far from 10 at t = 1, but certainly we can
do better. Let’s look at the times 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 1.0, and try approximating the location of the object at
each, by supposing that during each tenth of a second the object is going at a constant speed. Since the
object initially has speed 0, we again suppose it maintains this speed, but only for a tenth of second; during
that time the object would not move. During the tenth of a second from t = 0.1 to t = 0.2, we suppose that
the object is traveling at 0.3 cm/sec, namely, its actual speed at t = 0.1. In this case the object would travel
(0.3)(0.1) = 0.03 centimeters: 0.3 cm/sec times 0.1 seconds. Similarly, between t = 0.2 and t = 0.3 the
object would travel (0.6)(0.1) = 0.06 centimeters. Continuing, we get as an approximation that the object
travels
(0.0)(0.1) + (0.3)(0.1) + (0.6)(0.1) + · · ·+ (2.7)(0.1) = 1.35
centimeters, ending up at position 11.35. This is a better approximation than 10, certainly, but is still just
an approximation. (We know in fact that the object ends up at position 11.5, because we’ve already done
the problem using the first approach.) Presumably, we will get a better approximation if we divide the
time into one hundred intervals of a hundredth of a second each, and repeat the process:
(0.0)(0.01) + (0.03)(0.01) + (0.06)(0.01) + · · ·+ (2.97)(0.01) = 1.485.
We thus approximate the position as 11.485. Since we know the exact answer, we can see that this is much
closer, but if we did not already know the answer, we wouldn’t really know how close.
219

220

Integration

We can keep this up, but we’ll never really know the exact answer if we simply compute more and
more examples. Let’s instead look at a “typical” approximation. Suppose we divide the time into n equal
intervals, and imagine that on each of these the object travels at a constant speed. Over the first time interval we approximate the distance traveled as (0.0)(1/n) = 0, as before. During the second time interval,
from t = 1/n to t = 2/n, the object travels approximately 3(1/n)(1/n) = 3/n2 centimeters. During time
interval number i, the object travels approximately (3(i − 1)/n)(1/n) = 3(i − 1)/n2 centimeters, that is,
its speed at time (i − 1)/n, 3(i − 1)/n, times the length of time interval number i, 1/n. Adding these up as
before, we approximate the distance traveled as

centimeters. What can we say about this? At first it looks rather less useful than the concrete calculations
we’ve already done, but in fact a bit of algebra reveals it to be much more useful. We can factor out a 3
and 1/n2 to get
3
(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (n − 1)),
n2
that is, 3/n2 times the sum of the first n − 1 positive integers. Now we make use of a fact you may have
run across before, Gauss’s Equation:
1+2+3+···+k =
In our case we’re interested in k = n − 1, so

Now this is quite easy to understand: as n gets larger and larger this approximation gets closer and closer
to (3/2)(1 − 0) = 3/2, so that 3/2 is the exact distance traveled during one second, and the final position
is 11.5.
So for t = 1, at least, this rather cumbersome approach gives the same answer as the first approach. But
really there’s nothing special about t = 1; let’s just call it t instead. In this case the approximate distance
traveled during time interval number i is 3(i − 1)(t/n)(t/n) = 3(i − 1)t 2/n2 , that is, speed 3(i − 1)(t/n)
times time t/n, and the total distance traveled is approximately

given by the first approach to the problem.

Example 6.2: Area under the Line

Find the area under the curve y = 3x between x = 0 and any positive value x.
Solution. There is here no obvious analogue to the first approach in the previous example, but the second
approach works fine. (Since the function y = 3x is so simple, there is another approach that works here, but
it is even more limited in potential application than is approach number one.) How might we approximate
the desired area? We know how to compute areas of rectangles, so we approximate the area by rectangles.
Jumping straight to the general case, suppose we divide the interval between 0 and x into n equal subintervals, and use a rectangle above each subinterval to approximate the area under the curve. There are many
ways we might do this, but let’s use the height of the curve at the left endpoint of the subinterval as the
height of the rectangle, as in figure 6.1. The height of rectangle number i is then 3(i − 1)(x/n), the width
is x/n, and the area is 3(i − 1)(x2/n2 ). The total area of the rectangles is

Figure 6.1: Approximating the area under y = 3x with rectangles.
What you will have noticed, of course, is that while the problem in the second example appears to
be much different than the problem in the first example, and while the easy approach to problem one
does not appear to apply to problem two, the “approximation” approach works in both, and moreover the
calculations are identical. As we will see, there are many, many problems that appear much different on
the surface but turn out to be the same as these problems, in the sense that when we try to approximate
solutions we end up with mathematics that looks like the two examples, though of course the function
involved will not always be so simple.

222

Integration

Even better, we now see that while the second problem did not appear to be amenable to approach one,
it can in fact be solved in the same way. The reasoning is this: we know that problem one can be solved
easily by finding a function whose derivative is 3t. We also know that mathematically the two problems
are the same, because both can be solved by taking a limit of a sum, and the sums are identical. Therefore,
we don’t really need to compute the limit of either sum because we know that we will get the same answer
by computing a function with the derivative 3t or, which is the same thing, 3x.
It’s true that the first problem had the added complication of the “10”, and we certainly need to be able
to deal with such minor variations, but that turns out to be quite simple. The lesson then is this: whenever
we can solve a problem by taking the limit of a sum of a certain form, instead of computing the (often
nasty) limit we can find a new function with a certain derivative.

A fundamental calculus technique is to first answer a given problem with an approximation, then refine
that approximation to make it better, then use limits in the refining process to find the exact answer. That
is exactly what we will do here to develop a technique to find the area of more complicated regions.
Consider the region given in Figure 6.2, which is the area under y = 4x − x2 on [0, 4]. What is the
signed area of this region? While we will not
use this notation in this section, we will soon see that this is

4 and find the area is approximately 16 square units. This is obviously an over–approximation; we are
including area in the rectangle that is not under the parabola. How can we refine our approximation to
make it better? The key to this section is this answer: use more rectangles.
Let’s use four rectangles of equal width of 1. This partitions the interval [0, 4] into four subintervals,
[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3] and [3, 4]. On each subinterval we will draw a rectangle.
There are three common ways to determine the height of these rectangles: the Left Hand Rule, the
Right Hand Rule, and the Midpoint Rule. The Left Hand Rule says to evaluate the function at the left–
hand endpoint of the subinterval and make the rectangle that height. In Figure 6.3 below, the rectangle
drawn on the interval [2, 3] has height determined by the Left Hand Rule; it has a height of f (2) = 4. (The
rectangle is labeled “LHR.”)

Figure 6.3: Approximating area using rectangles
The Right Hand Rule says the opposite: on each subinterval, evaluate the function at the right endpoint and make the rectangle that height. In the figure, the rectangle drawn on [0, 1] is drawn using f (1) = 3
as its height; this rectangle is labeled “RHR.”.
The Midpoint Rule says that on each subinterval, evaluate the function at the midpoint and make the
rectangle that height. The rectangle drawn on [1, 2] was made using the Midpoint Rule, with a height of
f (1.5) = 3.75. That rectangle is labeled “MPR.”
These are the three most common rules for determining the heights of approximating rectangles, but
we are not forced to use one of these three methods. The rectangle on [3, 4] has a height of approximately
f (3.53), very close to the Midpoint Rule. It was chosen so that the area of the rectangle is exactly the area
of the region under f on [3, 4]. (Later you’ll be able to figure how to do this, too.)
The following example will approximate the area under f (x) = 4x − x2 using these rules.
Example 6.3: Using the Left Hand, Right Hand and Midpoint Rules

Approximate the area under f (x) = 4x − x2 on the interval [0, 4] using the Left Hand Rule, the Right
Hand Rule, and the Midpoint Rule, using four equally spaced subintervals.
Solution. We break the interval [0, 4] into four subintervals as before. In Figure 6.4 we see four rectangles
drawn on f (x) = 4x − x2 using the Left Hand Rule. (The areas of the rectangles are given in each figure.)

Figure 6.4: Approximating area using the Left Hand Rule
Note how in the first subinterval, [0, 1], the rectangle has height f (0) = 0. We add up the areas of each
rectangle (height× width) for our Left Hand Rule approximation:
f (0) · 1 + f (1) · 1 + f (2) · 1 + f (3) · 1 =
0 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 10.

In this figure, these rectangles seem to be the mirror image of those found in Figure 6.4. (This is because
of the symmetry of our shaded region.) Our approximation gives the same answer as before, though
calculated a different way:
f (1) · 1 + f (2) · 1 + f (3) · 1 + f (4) · 1 =
3 + 4 + 3 + 0 = 10.

1.75 + 3.75 + 3.75 + 1.75 = 11.
Our three methods provide two approximations of the area under f (x) = 4x − x2 : 10 and 11.

♣

It is hard to tell at this moment which is a better approximation: 10 or 11? We can continue to refine
our approximation by using more rectangles. The notation can become unwieldy, though, as we add up
longer and longer lists of numbers. We introduce summation notation (also called sigma notation) to
solve this problem.
Suppose we wish to add up a list of numbers a1 , a2 , a3 , . . . , a9 . Instead of writing
a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 + a6 + a7 + a8 + a9 ,
we use summation notation and write

9

∑ ai

i=1

The upper case sigma (∑) represents the term “sum” and ai is referred to as the summand. The index
of summation in this example is i; any symbol can be used. By convention, the index takes on only the
integer values between (and including) the lower and upper bounds, here equal to 1 and 9 respectively.
Let’s practice using this notation.
Example 6.4: Using Summation Notation

Let the numbers {ai } be defined as ai = 2i − 1 for integers i, where i ≥ 1. So a1 = 1, a2 = 3, a3 = 5,
etc. (The output is the positive odd integers). Evaluate the following summations:
1. ∑6i=1 ai
2. ∑7i=3 (3ai − 4)
3. ∑4i=1 (ai )2
Solution.

Consider again f (x) = 4x − x2 . We will approximate the area under this curve (again for [0, 4] using
sixteen equally spaced subintervals and the Right Hand Rule. Before doing so, we will do some careful

Figure 6.7: Dividing [0, 4] into 16 equally spaced subintervals
Figure 6.7 shows a number line of [0, 4] divided into sixteen equally spaced subintervals. We denote 0
as x1 ; we have marked the values of x5 , x9 , x13 and x17 . We could mark them all, but the figure would get
crowded. While it is easy to figure that x10 = 2.25, in general, we want a method of determining the value
of xi without consulting the figure. Consider:
xi = x1 + (i − 1)∆x
where
x1 : starting value
(i − 1) : number of subintervals between x1 and xi
∆x : subinterval width
So x10 = x1 + 9(4/16) = 2.25.
If we had partitioned [0, 4] into 100 equally spaced subintervals, each subinterval would have length
∆x = 4/100 = 0.04. We could compute x32 as
x32 = 0 + 31(4/100) = 1.24.
(That was far faster than creating a sketch first.)
Given any subdivision of [0, 4], the first subinterval is [x1 , x2 ]; the second is [x2 , x3 ]; the i th subinterval
is [xi , xi+1 ].

function and the sixteen rectangles are graphed. While some rectangles over–approximate the area, other
under–approximate the area (by about the same amount). Thus our approximate area of 10.625 is likely a
fairly good approximation.

Using many, many rectangles, we have a likely good approximation of the area under f (x) = 4x − x2

♣
Before the above example, we stated the summations for the Left Hand, Right Hand and Midpoint
Rules. Each had the same basic structure, which was:
1. each rectangle has the same width, which we referred to as ∆x, and
2. each rectangle’s height is determined by evaluating f (x) at a particular point in each subinterval.
For instance, the Left Hand Rule states that each rectangle’s height is determined by evaluating f (x)
at the left hand endpoint of the subinterval the rectangle lives on.
One could partition an interval [a, b] with subintervals that did not have the same width. We refer to
the length of the first subinterval as ∆x1 , the length of the second subinterval as ∆x2 , and so on, giving the
length of the i th subinterval as ∆xi . Also, one could determine each rectangle’s height by evaluating f (x) at
any point in the i th subinterval. We refer to the point picked in the first subinterval as c1 , the point picked

230

Integration

in the second subinterval as c2 , and so on, with ci representing the point picked in the i th subinterval. Thus
the height of the i th subinterval would be f (ci ), and the area of the i th rectangle would be f (ci )∆xi .
Summations of rectangles with area f (ci )∆xi are named after mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard
Riemann, as given in the following definition.
Definition 6.8: Riemann Sum

Let f (x) be defined on the closed interval [a, b] and let ∆x be a partition of [a, b], with
a = x1 < x2 < . . . < xn < xn+1 = b.

Let ∆xi denote the length of the i th subinterval [xi , xi+1 ] and let ci denote any value in the i th subinterval.

Figure 6.9: General Riemann sum to approximate the area under f (x) = 4x − x2
Figure 6.9 shows the approximating rectangles of a Riemann sum. While the rectangles in this example
do not approximate well the shaded area, they demonstrate that the subinterval widths may vary and the
heights of the rectangles can be determined without following a particular rule.
Riemann sums are typically calculated using one of the three rules we have introduced. The uniformity
of construction makes computations easier. Before working another example, let’s summarize some of
what we have learned in a convenient way.

Let’s do another example.
Example 6.9: Approximating Area Using Sums

Approximate the area under f (x) = (5x + 2) on the interval [−2, 3] using the Midpoint Rule and ten
equally spaced intervals.
Solution. Following the above discussion, we have

As we are using the Midpoint Rule, we will also need xi+1 and

xi + xi+1

Note the graph of f (x) = 5x + 2 in Figure 6.10. The regions whose areas are computed are triangles,
meaning we can find the exact answer without summation techniques. We find that the exact answer is
indeed 22.5. One of the strengths of the Midpoint Rule is that often each rectangle includes area that should
not be counted, but misses other area that should. When the partition width is small, these two amounts
are about equal and these errors almost “cancel each other out.” In this example, since our function is a
line, these errors are exactly equal and they do cancel each other out, giving us the exact answer.

Figure 6.10: Approximating area using the Midpoint Rule and 10 evenly spaced subintervals
Note too that when the function is negative, the rectangles have a “negative” height. When we compute
♣
the area of the rectangle, we use f (ci )∆x; when f is negative, the area is counted as negative.
Notice in the previous example that while we used ten equally spaced intervals, the number “10” didn’t
play a big role in the calculations until the very end. Mathematicians love abstract ideas; let’s approximate
the area of another region using n subintervals, where we do not specify a value of n until the very end.
Example 6.10: Approximating Area Using Sums

Revisit f (x) = 4x − x2 on the interval [0, 4, ] yet again. Approximate the area under this curve using
the Right Hand Rule with n equally spaced subintervals.
Solution. We know ∆x = 4−0
n = 4/n. We also find xi = 0 + ∆x(i − 1) = 4(i − 1)/n. The Right Hand Rule
uses xi+1 , which is xi+1 = 4i/n. We construct the Right Hand Rule Riemann sum as follows.

Recall how earlier we approximated the area with 4 subintervals; with n = 4, the formula gives 10, our
answer as before.
It is now easy to approximate the area with 1, 000, 000 subintervals! Hand-held calculators will round
off the answer a bit prematurely giving an answer of 10.66666667. (The actual answer is 10.666666666656.)
We now take an important leap. Up to this point, our mathematics has been limited to geometry and

shrinks to zero and we obtain the exact area.

This section started with a fundamental calculus technique: make an approximation, refine the approximation to make it better, then use limits in the refining process to get an exact answer. That is precisely
what we just did.
Let’s practice this again.
Example 6.11: Approximating Area With a Formula, Using Sums

Find a formula that approximates the area under f (x) = x3 on the interval [−1, 5] using the Right
Hand Rule and n equally spaced subintervals, then take the limit as n → ∞ to find the exact area.

6.1. Displacement and Area

We have used limits to evaluate exactly given definite limits. Will this always work? We will show,
given not–very–restrictive conditions, that yes, it will always work.
The previous two examples demonstrated how an expression such as
n

∑ f (xi+1 )∆x

i=1

can be rewritten as an expression explicitly involving n, such as 32/3(1 − 1/n2).
Viewed in this manner, we can think of the summation as a function of n. An n value is given (where n
is a positive integer), and the sum of areas of n equally spaced rectangles is returned, using the Left Hand,
Right Hand, or Midpoint Rules.
Given a function f (x) defined on the interval [a, b] let:
n

• SL (n) = ∑ f (xi )∆x, the sum of equally spaced rectangles formed using the Left Hand Rule,
i=1
n

• SR (n) = ∑ f (xi+1 )∆x, the sum of equally spaced rectangles formed using the Right Hand Rule, and

Recall the definition of a limit as n → ∞: lim SL (n) = K if, given any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such
n→∞

that |SL (n) − K| < ε whenever n ≥ δ .
The following theorem states that we can use any of our three rules to find the exact value of the area
under f (x) on [a, b]. It also goes two steps further. The theorem states that the height of each rectangle
doesn’t have to be determined following a specific rule, but could be f (ci ), where ci is any point in the i th
subinterval, as discussed earlier.
The theorem goes on to state that the rectangles do not need to be of the same width. Using the
notation of Definition 6.8, let ∆xi denote the length of the i th subinterval in a partition of [a, b]. Now let
||∆x|| represent the length of the largest subinterval in the partition: that is, ||∆x|| is the largest of all the
∆xi ’s. If ||∆x|| is small, then [a, b] must be partitioned into many subintervals, since all subintervals must
have small lengths. “Taking the limit as ||∆x|| goes to zero” implies that the number n of subintervals in
the partition is growing to infinity, as the largest subinterval length is becoming arbitrarily small. We then
interpret the expression
n

lim

∑ f (ci)∆xi

||∆x||→0 i=1

as “the limit of the sum of rectangles, where the width of each rectangle can be different but getting small,
and the height of each rectangle is not necessarily determined by a particular rule.” The following theorem
states that, for a sufficiently nice function, we can use any of our three rules to find the area under f (x)
over [a, b].

We summarize what we have learned over the past few sections here.
• Knowing the “area under the curve” can be useful. One common example is: the area under a
velocity curve is displacement.
• While we can approximate the area under a curve in many ways, we have focused on using rectangles
whose heights can be determined using: the Left Hand Rule, the Right Hand Rule and the Midpoint
Rule.
• Sums of rectangles of this type are called Riemann sums.
• The exact value of the area can be computed using the limit of a Riemann sum. We generally use
one of the above methods as it makes the algebra simpler.

Exercise 6.1.8 Let f (x) = x2 − 2x + 3. Approximate the area under the curve between x = 1 and x = 3
using 4 rectangles.

6.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
We begin by exploring an example. Suppose that an object moves in a straight line so that its speed is 3t
at time t. How far does the object travel between time t = a and time t = b? We don’t assume that we
know where the object is at time t = 0 or at any other time. It is certainly true that it is somewhere, so
let’s suppose that at t = 0 the position is k. Then we know that the position of the object at any time is
3t 2/2 +k. This means that at time t = a the position is 3a2 /2 +k and at time t = b the position is 3b2 /2 +k.
Therefore the change in position is 3b2 /2 + k − (3a2 /2 + k) = 3b2 /2 − 3a2/2. Notice that the k drops out;
this means that it doesn’t matter that we don’t know k, it doesn’t even matter if we use the wrong k, we get
the correct answer.
What about a second approach to this problem? We now want to approximate the change in position
between time a and time b. We take the interval of time between a and b, divide it into n subintervals,
and approximate the distance traveled during each. The starting time of subinterval number i is now
a + (i − 1)(b − a)/n, which we abbreviate as ti−1, so that t0 = a, t1 = a + (b − a)/n, and so on. The speed
of the object is f (t) = 3t, and each subinterval is (b − a)/n = ∆t seconds long. The distance traveled
during subinterval number i is approximately f (ti−1)∆t, and the total change in distance is approximately
f (t0)∆t + f (t1)∆t + · · · + f (tn−1 )∆t.
The exact change in position is the limit of this sum as n goes to infinity. We abbreviate this sum using
sigma notation:
n−1

∑ f (ti)∆t = f (t0)∆t + f (t1)∆t + · · · + f (tn−1 )∆t.

i=0

The notation on the left side of the equal sign uses a large capital sigma, a Greek letter, and the left side is
an abbreviation for the right side. The answer we seek is
n−1

lim

n→∞

∑ f (ti)∆t.

i=0

Since this must be the same as the answer we have already obtained, we know that

The significance of 3t 2/2, into which we substitute t = b and t = a, is of course that it is a function whose

n−1

lim

n→∞

∑ f (ti)∆t,

i=0

238

Integration

it no longer matters what f (t) stands for—it could be a speed, or the height of a curve, or something else
entirely. We know that the limit can be computed by finding any function with derivative f (t), substituting
a and b, and subtracting. We summarize this in a theorem. First, we introduce some new notation and
terms.
We write
Z b
a

n−1

f (t) dt = lim

n→∞

∑ f (ti)∆t

i=0

if the limit
exists. That is, the left hand side means, or is an abbreviation for, the right hand side. The
R
symbol is called an integral sign, and the whole expression is read as “the integral of f (t) from a to
b.” What we have learned is that this integral can be computed by finding a function, say F(t), with the
property that F ′ (t) = f (t), and then computing F(b) − F(a). The function F(t) is called an antiderivative
of f (t). Now the theorem:
Theorem 6.13: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Suppose that f (x) is continuous on the interval [a, b]. If F(x) is any antiderivative of f (x), then
Z b

f (x) dx = F(b) − F(a).

Z x

f (t) dt = F(x) − F(a).

a

Let’s rewrite this slightly:

a

We’ve replaced the variable x by t and b by x. These are just different names for quantities, so the
substitution doesn’t change the meaning. It does make it easier to think of the two sides of the equation as
functions. The expression
Z
x

a

f (t) dt

is a function: plug in a value for x, get out some other value. The expression F(x) − F(a) is of course also
a function, and it has a nice property:
d
(F(x) − F(a)) = F ′ (x) = f (x),
dx
since F(a) is a constant and has derivative zero. In other words, by shifting our point of view slightly, we
see that the odd looking function
Z x
G(x) =
f (t) dt
a

has a derivative, and that in fact G′ (x) =

f (x). This is really just a restatement of the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus, and indeed is often called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. To avoid confusion, some
people call the two versions of the theorem “The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, part I” and “The
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, part II”, although unfortunately there is no universal agreement as to
which is part I and which part II. Since it really is the same theorem, differently stated, some people simply
call them both “The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.”

6.2. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

239

Theorem 6.14: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Suppose that f (x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and let
G(x) =

Z x
a

f (t) dt.

Then G′ (x) = f (x).
We have not really proved the Fundamental Theorem. In a nutshell, we gave the following argument
to justify it: Suppose we want to know the value of
Z b
a

n−1

f (t) dt = lim

n→∞

∑ f (ti)∆t.

i=0

We can interpret the right hand side as the distance traveled by an object whose speed is given by f (t). We
know another way to compute the answer to such a problem: find the position of the object by finding an
antiderivative of f (t), then substitute t = a and t = b and subtract to find the distance traveled. This must
be the answer to the original problem as well, even if f (t) does not represent a speed.
What’s wrong with this? In some sense, nothing. As a practical matter it is a very convincing argument,
because our understanding of the relationship between speed and distance seems to be quite solid. From
the point of view of mathematics, however, it is unsatisfactory to justify a purely mathematical relationship
by appealing to our understanding of the physical universe, which could, however unlikely it is in this case,
be wrong.
A complete proof is a bit too involved to include here, but we will indicate how it goes. First, if we can
prove the second version of the Fundamental Theorem, Theorem 6.14, then we can prove the first version
from that:
Proof. Proof of Theorem 6.13.
We know from Theorem 6.14 that
Z x
G(x) =
f (t) dt
a

is an antiderivative of f (x), and therefore any antiderivative F(x) of f (x) is of the form F(x) = G(x) + k.
Then
F(b) − F(a) = G(b) + k − (G(a) + k) = G(b) − G(a)
Z b

It is not hard to see that

f (t) dt = 0, so this means that
F(b) − F(a) =

which is exactly what Theorem 6.13 says.

Z b

f (t) dt,
♣

So the real job is to prove Theorem 6.14. We will sketch the proof, using some facts that we do not
prove. First, the following identity is true of integrals:
Z b
a

f (t) dt =

Z c
a

f (t) dt +

Z b
c

f (t) dt.

240

Integration

This can be proved directly from the definition of the integral, that is, using the limits of sums. It is quite
easy to see that it must be true by thinking of either of the two applications of integrals that we have seen.
It turns out that the identity is true no matter what c is, but it is easiest to think about the meaning when
a ≤ c ≤ b.
First, if f (t) represents a speed, then we know that the three integrals represent the distance traveled
between time a and time b; the distance traveled between time a and time c; and the distance traveled
between time c and time b. Clearly the sum of the latter two is equal to the first of these.
Second, if f (t) represents the height of a curve, the three integrals represent the area under the curve
between a and b; the area under the curve between a and c; and the area under the curve between c and b.
Again it is clear from the geometry that the first is equal to the sum of the second and third.
Proof. Proof of Theorem 6.14.
We want to compute G′ (x), so we start with the definition of the derivative in terms of a limit:

Now we need to know something about
Z x+∆x

f (t) dt

Z x+∆x

f (t) dt

x

when ∆x is small; in fact, it is very close to ∆x f (x), but we will not prove this. Once again, it is easy to
believe this is true by thinking of our two applications: The integral

x

can be interpreted as the distance traveled by an object over a very short interval of time. Over a sufficiently
short period of time, the speed of the object will not change very much, so the distance traveled will be
approximately the length of time multiplied by the speed at the beginning of the interval, namely, ∆x f (x).
Alternately, the integral may be interpreted as the area under the curve between x and x + ∆x. When ∆x is
very small, this will be very close to the area of the rectangle with base ∆x and height f (x); again this is
∆x f (x). If we accept this, we may proceed:
1
lim
∆x→0 ∆x
which is what we wanted to show.

Z x+∆x

= f (x),
∆x→0 ∆x

f (t) dt = lim

♣

It is still true that we are depending on an interpretation of the integral to justify the argument, but
we have isolated this part of the argument into two facts that are not too hard to prove. Once the last
reference to interpretation has been removed from the proofs of these facts, we will have a real proof of
the Fundamental Theorem.

6.2. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

241

Now we know that to solve certain kinds of problems, those that lead to a sum of a certain form, we
“merely” find an antiderivative and substitute two values and subtract. Unfortunately, finding antiderivatives can be quite difficult. While there are a small number of rules that allow us to compute the derivative
of any common function, there are no such rules for antiderivatives. There are some techniques that frequently prove useful, but we will never be able to reduce the problem to a completely mechanical process.
Due to the close relationship between an integral and an antiderivative, the integral sign is also used to
mean “antiderivative”. You can tell which is intended by whether the limits of integration are included:
Z 2

x2 dx

is an ordinary integral, also called a definite integral, because it has a definite value, namely

x2 dx =

We use

3

x2 dx

to denote the antiderivative of x2 , also called an indefinite integral. So this is evaluated as
Z

x2 dx =

x3
+C.
3

It is customary to include the constant C to indicate that there are really an infinite number of antiderivatives. We do not need this C to compute definite integrals, but in other circumstances we will need to
remember that the C is there, so it is best to get into the habit of writing the C. When we compute a
definite integral, we first find an antiderivative and then substitute. It is convenient to first display the
antiderivative and then do the substitution; we need a notation indicating that the substitution is yet to be
done. A typical solution would look like this:
Z 2

23 13 7
− = .

3

The vertical line with subscript and superscript is used to indicate the operation “substitute and subtract”
that is needed to finish the evaluation.
We seem to have found a pattern. When attempting to solve a previous question, we found the antiderivative of x2 to be x3 /3 + c (as it was when solving the indefinite integral). Likewise, when we first
began, we were trying to determine a position based on velocity, and 3t gave rise to 3t 2/2 + k.
As will be formalized later, we see that in these cases, the power is increased to n + 1, but we also
divide through by this factor, n + 1. So x becomes x2 /2, x2 becomes x3 /3, and x3 will become x4 /4.
Now we will also try with negative and fraction values in the following example.

We next apply FTC to differentiate a function.
Example 6.18: Using FTC

Differentiate the following function:
g(x) =

Z x

−2

cos(1 + 5t) sint dt.

Solution. We simply apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus directly to get:
g′ (x) = cos(1 + 5x) sin x.
♣
Using the Chain Rule we can derive a formula for some more complicated problems. We have:
d
dx

Z v(x)
a

f (t) dt = f (v(x)) · v′ (x).

Now what if the upper limit is constant and the lower limit is a function of x? Then we interchange the
limits and add a minus sign to get:
d
dx

Z a

u(x)

d
f (t) dt = −
dx

Z u(x)
a

f (t) dt = − f (u(x)) · u′(x).

246

Integration

Combining these two we can get a formula where both limits are a function of x. We break up the
integral as follows:
Z v(x)

f (t) dt =

u(x)

Z a

u(x)

f (t) dt +

Z v(x)
a

f (t) dt.

We just need to make sure f (a) exists after we break up the integral. Then differentiating and using the
above two formulas gives:
FTC I + Chain Rule:
d
dx

Z v(x)
u(x)

f (t) dt = f (v(x))v′ (x) − f (u(x))u′ (x)

Many textbooks do not show this formula and instead to solve these types of problems will use FTC I
along with the tricks we used to derive the formula above. Either method is perfectly fine.
Example 6.19: FTC I + Chain Rule

Differentiate the following integral:
Z x2

10x

t 3 sin(1 + t) dt.

Solution. We will use the formula above. We have f (t) = t 3 sin(1 + t), u(x) = 10x and v(x) = x2 . Then
u′ (x) = 10 and v′ (x) = 2x. Thus,

6.3 Indefinite Integrals
In this section we focus on computing indefinite integrals. The process of finding the indefinite integral is
called integration (or integrating f (x)).
Example 6.21: Indefinite Integral

Evaluate the following indefinite integral:
Z

x5 + 3x − 2 dx.

Solution. Since this is asking for the most general anti-derivative we have:

where C is a constant.

Common mistakes: One habit students make with integrals is to drop the dx at the end of the integral.
This is required! Think of the integral as a set of parenthesis. Both are required so it is clear where the
integrand ends and what variable you are integrating with respect to.
Another common mistake is to forget the +C for indefinite integrals.
Note that we don’t have properties to deal with products or quotients of functions, that is,

With derivatives, we had the product and quotient rules to deal with these cases. For integrals, we have no
such rules, but we will learn a variety of different techniques to deal with these cases.
The following integral rules can be proved by taking the derivative of the functions on the right side.

Differential Equations
An equation involving derivatives where we want to solve for the original function is called a differential
equation. For example, f ′ (x) = 2x is a differential equation with general solution f (x) = x2 +C. Some

6.3. Indefinite Integrals

251

solutions (i.e., particular values of C) are shown below.

As seen with integral curves, we may have an infinite family of solutions satisfying the differential equation. However, if we were given a point (called an initial value) on the curve then we could determine
f (x) completely. Such a problem is known as an initial value problem.
Example 6.26: Initial Value Problem

If f ′ (x) = 2x and f (0) = 2 then determine f (x).
Solution. As previously stated, we have a solution of:
f (x) = x2 +C.
But f (0) = 2 implies:

2 = 02 +C

→

C = 2.

Therefore, f (x) = x2 + 2 is the solution to the initial value problem.

7. Techniques of Integration
Over the next few sections we examine some techniques that are frequently successful when seeking
antiderivatives of functions.

7.1 Substitution Rule
Needless to say, most integration problems we will encounter will not be so simple. That is to say we will
require more than the basic integration rules we have seen. Here’s a slightly more complicated example:
Find
Z
2x cos(x2 ) dx.

This is not a “simple” derivative, but a little thought reveals that it must have come from an application
of the chain rule. Multiplied on the “outside” is 2x, which is the derivative of the “inside” function x2 .
Checking:
d
d
sin(x2 ) = cos(x2 ) x2 = 2x cos(x2 ),
dx
dx
so
Z
2x cos(x2 ) dx = sin(x2 ) +C.
To summarize: If we suspect that a given function is the derivative of another via the chain rule, we
let u denote a likely candidate for the inner function, then translate the given function so that it is written
entirely in terms of u, with no x remaining in the expression. If we can integrate this new function of u,
then the antiderivative of the original function is obtained by replacing u by the equivalent expression in x.
Theorem 7.1: Substitution Rule for Indefinite Integrals

If u = g(x) is a differentiable function whose range is an interval I and f is continuous on I , then
Z

′

f (g(x))g (x) dx =

Z

f (u) du.

Even in simple cases you may prefer to use this mechanical procedure, since it often helps to avoid
silly mistakes. For example, consider again this simple problem:
Z

2x cos(x2 ) dx.

Let u = x2 , then du/dx = 2x or du = 2x dx. Since we have exactly 2x dx in the original integral, we can
replace it by du:
Z
Z
2x cos(x2 ) dx =

cos u du = sin u +C = sin(x2 ) +C.
253

254

Techniques of Integration

This is not the only way to do the algebra, and typically there are many paths to the correct answer.
Another possibility, for example, is: Since du/dx = 2x, dx = du/2x, and then the integral becomes
Z

2

2x cos(x ) dx =

Z

du
2x cos u
=
2x

Z

cos u du.

The important thing to remember is that you must eliminate all instances of the original variable x.
Example 7.2: Substitution Rule

Evaluate

Z

(ax + b)n dx, assuming a, b are constants, a 6= 0, and n is a positive integer.

Solution. We let u = ax + b so du = a dx or dx = du/a. Then
Z

(ax + b)n dx =

Strategy for Substitution Rule
A general strategy to follow is:
1. Choose a possible u = u(x). Tip: Choose a substitution u so that its derivate also appears in
the integral (up to a constant).
2. Calculate du = u′ (x) dx.
du
, and cancel.
u′ (x)
4. Write the rest of the integrand in terms of u. If this is not possible, the substitution will not
work: You must go back to step 1.

3. Either replace u′ (x) dx by du, or replace dx by

5. Find the indefinite integral. (Again, if this is not possible, try a different substitution, or a
different method).
6. Rewrite the result in terms of x.

This is a problem because our integrals can’t have a mixture of two variables in them. Usually this means
we chose our u incorrectly. However, in this case we can eliminate the remaining x’s from our integral by
using:
u = x2 + 1 → x2 = u − 1.
We get:

A somewhat neater alternative to this method is to change the original limits to match the variable u. Since
u = x2 , when x = 2, u = 4, and when x = 4, u = 16. So we can do this:

Techniques of Integration

7.2 Powers of Trigonometric Functions
Functions consisting of powers of the sine and cosine can be integrated by using substitution and trigonometric identities. These can sometimes be tedious, but the technique is straightforward. A similar technique is applicable to powers of secant and tangent (and also cosecant and cotangent, not discussed here).
The trigonometric substitutions we will focus on in this section are summarized in the table below:
Substitution

u = cos x

u = tan x

u = sec x

du = cos x dx

du = − sin x dx

Observe that by taking the substitution u = cos x in the last example, we ended up with an even power
of sine from which we can use the formula sin2 x + cos2 x = 1 to replace any remaining sines. We then
ended up with a polynomial in u in which we could expand and integrate quite easily.
This technique works for products of powers of sine and cosine. We summarize it below.

When evaluating

Z

sinm x cosn x dx:

1. The power of sine is odd (m odd):
(a) Use u = cos x and du = − sin x dx.
(b) Replace dx using (a), thus cancelling one power of sin x by the substitution of du, and be
left with an even number of sine powers.
(c) Use sin2 x = 1 − cos2 x (= 1 − u2 ) to replace the leftover sines.
2. The power of cosine is odd (n odd):
(a) Use u = sin x and du = cos x dx.
(b) Replace dx using (a), thus cancelling one power of cos x by the substitution of du, and be
left with an even number of cosine powers.
(c) Use cos2 x = 1 − sin2 x (= 1 − u2 ) to replace the leftover cosines.
3. Both m and n are odd:
Use either 1 or 2 (both will work).
4. Both m and n are even:
Use cos2 x = 21 (1 + cos(2x)) and/or sin2 x = 21 (1 − cos(2x)) to reduce to a form that can be
integrated.
NOTE: As m and n get large, multiple steps will be needed.

7.3 Trigonometric Substitutions
So far we have seen that it sometimes helps to replace a subexpression of a function by a single variable.
Occasionally it can help to replace the original variable by something more complicated. This seems like
a “reverse” substitution, but it is really no different in principle than ordinary substitution.

We would like to replace cos2 u by cos u, but this is valid only if cos u is positive, since cos2 u is
positive. Consider again the substitution x = sin u. We could just as well think of this as u = arcsin x. If
we do, then by the definition of the arcsine, −π /2 ≤ u ≤ π /2, so cos u ≥ 0. Then we continue:

♣
This type of substitution is usually indicated when the function you wish to integrate contains a polynomial expression that might allow you to use the fundamental identity sin2 x + cos2 x = 1 in one of three
forms:
cos2 x = 1 − sin2 x
sec2 x = 1 + tan2 x
tan2 x = sec2 x − 1.

If your function contains 1 − x2 , as in the example above, try x = sin u; if it contains 1 + x2 try x = tan u;
and if it contains x2 − 1, try x = sec u. Sometimes you will need to try something a bit different to handle
constants other than one which we will describe below. First we discuss inverse substitutions.
In a traditional substitution we let u = u(x), i.e., our new variable is defined in terms of x. In an
inverse substitution we let x = g(u), i.e., we assume x can be written in terms of u. We cannot do this
arbitrarily since we do NOT get to “choose” x. For example, an inverse substitution of x = 1 will give an

7.3. Trigonometric Substitutions

271

obviously wrong answer. However, when x = g(u) is an invertible function, then we are really doing a
u-substitution with u = g−1 (x). Now the substitution rule applies.
Sometimes with inverse substitutions involving trig functions we use θ instead of u. Thus, we would
take x = sin θ instead of x = sin u. However, as we discussed above, we would like our inverse substitution
x = g(u) to be a one-to-one function, and x = sin u is not one-to-one. We can overcome this issue by using
the restricted trigonometric functions. The three common trigonometric substitutions are the restricted
sine, restricted tangent and restricted secant. Thus, for sine we use the domain [−π /2, π /2] and for
tangent we use (−π /2, π /2). Depending on the convention chosen, the restricted secant function is
usually defined in one of two ways.

One convention is to restrict secant to the region [0, π /2) ∪ (π /2, π ] as shown in the middle graph. The
other convention is to use [0, π /2) ∪ [π , 3π /2) as shown in the right graph. Both choices give a one-toone restricted secant function and no universal convention has been adopted. To make the analysis in this
section less cumbersome, we will use the domain [0, π /2) ∪ [π , 3π /2) for the restricted secant function.
Then sec−1 x is defined to be the inverse of this restricted secant function.
Typically trigonometric substitions are used for problems that involve radical expressions. The table
below outlines when each substitution is typically used along with their intervals of validity.

All three substitutions are one-to-one on the listed intervals. When dealing with radicals we often end up
with absolute values since

in each case when encountering a radical.

This is because tan θ ≥ 0 when θ ∈ [0, π /2) ∪ [π , 3π /2).
Thus, when using an appropriate trigonometric substitution we can usually ignore the absolute value.
After integrating, we typically get an answer in terms of θ (or u) and need to convert back to x’s. To do
so, we use the two guidelines below:
• For trig functions containing θ , use a triangle to convert to x’s.
• For θ by itself, use the inverse trig function.
All pieces needed for such a trigonometric substitution can be summarized as follows:

7.4 Integration by Parts
We have already seen that recognizing the product rule can be useful, when we noticed that
Z

sec3 u + sec u tan2 u du = sec u tan u.

As with substitution, we do not have to rely on insight or cleverness to discover such antiderivatives; there
is a technique that will often help to uncover the product rule.
Start with the product rule:
d
f (x)g(x) = f ′ (x)g(x) + f (x)g′ (x).
dx
We can rewrite this as

f (x)g(x) dx +

Z

f (x)g′ (x) dx,

f (x)g (x) dx = f (x)g(x) −

Z

f ′ (x)g(x) dx.

and then

This may not seem particularly useful at first glance, but it turns out that in many cases we have an integral
of the form

but that

Techniques of Integration

is easier. This technique for turning one integral into another is called integration by parts, and is usually
written in more compact form. If we let u = f (x) and v = g(x) then du = f ′ (x) dx and dv = g′ (x) dx and
Z

u dv = uv −

Z

v du.

To use this technique we need to identify likely candidates for u = f (x) and dv = g′ (x) dx.

♣

Such repeated use of integration by parts is fairly common, but it can be a bit tedious to accomplish,
and it is easy to make errors, especially sign errors involving the subtraction in the formula. There is a
nice tabular method to accomplish the calculation that minimizes the chance for error and speeds up the
whole process. We illustrate with the previous example. Here is the table:
sign u
dv
+ x2 sin x
2x − cos x
+
2 − sin x
0
cos x
To form this table, we start with u at the top of the second column and repeatedly compute the derivative;
starting with dv at the top of the third column, we repeatedly compute the antiderivative. In the first
column, we place a “−” in every second row. To form the second table we combine the first and second

280

Techniques of Integration

columns by ignoring the boundary; if you do this by hand, you may simply start with two columns and
add a “−” to every second row.
Alternatively, we can use the following table:
u
dv
2
x
sin x
−2x − cos x
2
− sin x
0
cos x
To compute with this second table we begin at the top. Multiply the first entry in column u by the second
entry in column dv to get −x2 cos x, and add this to the integral of the product of the second entry in
column u and second entry in column dv. This gives:
2

−x cos x +

Z

2x cos x dx,

or exactly the result of the first application of integration by parts. Since this integral is not yet easy, we
return to the table. Now we multiply twice on the diagonal, (x2 )(− cos x) and (−2x)(− sin x) and then
once straight across, (2)(− sinx), and combine these as
2

−x cos x + 2x sin x −

Z

2 sin x dx,

giving the same result as the second application of integration by parts. While this integral is easy, we
may return yet once more to the table. Now multiply three times on the diagonal to get (x2 )(− cos x),
(−2x)(− sin x), and (2)(cos x), and once straight across, (0)(cos x). We combine these as before to get
2

−x cos x + 2x sin x + 2 cos x +

Z

0 dx = −x2 cos x + 2x sin x + 2 cos x +C.

Typically we would fill in the table one line at a time, until the “straight across” multiplication gives an
easy integral. If we can see that the u column will eventually become zero, we can instead fill in the whole
table; computing the products as indicated will then give the entire integral, including the “+C ”, as above.

7.5 Rational Functions
A rational function is a fraction with polynomials in the numerator and denominator. For example,
x3
,
x2 + x − 6

1
,
(x − 3)2

x2 + 1
,
x2 − 1

are all rational functions of x. There is a general technique called “partial fractions” that, in principle,
allows us to integrate any rational function. The algebraic steps in the technique are rather cumbersome
if the polynomial in the denominator has degree more than 2, and the technique requires that we factor
the denominator, something that is not always possible. However, in practice one does not often run
across rational functions with high degree polynomials in the denominator for which one has to find the
antiderivative function. So we shall explain how to find the antiderivative of a rational function only when
the denominator is a quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c.

282

Techniques of Integration

We should mention a special type of rational function that we already know how to integrate: If the
denominator has the form (ax + b)n , the substitution u = ax + b will always work. The denominator
becomes un , and each x in the numerator is replaced by (u − b)/a, and dx = du/a. While it may be tedious
to complete the integration if the numerator has high degree, it is merely a matter of algebra.

♣

We now proceed to the case in which the denominator is a quadratic polynomial. We can always
factor out the coefficient of x2 and put it outside the integral, so we can assume that the denominator
has the form x2 + bx + c. There are three possible cases, depending on how the quadratic factors: either
x2 + bx + c = (x − r)(x − s), x2 + bx + c = (x − r)2 , or it doesn’t factor. We can use the quadratic formula
to decide which of these we have, and to factor the quadratic if it is possible.
Example 7.33: Factoring a Quadratic

Determine whether x2 + x + 1 factors, and factor it if possible.
Solution. The quadratic formula tells us that x2 + x + 1 = 0 when
√
−1 ± 1 − 4

Since there is no square root of −3, this quadratic does not factor.

If x2 + bx + c = (x − r)2 then we have the special case we have already seen, that can be handled with
a substitution. The other two cases require different approaches.
If x2 + bx + c = (x − r)(x − s), we have an integral of the form
Z

p(x)
dx
(x − r)(x − s)

where p(x) is a polynomial. The first step is to make sure that p(x) has degree less than 2.
Example 7.35:

Rewrite

x−r x−s
(x − r)(x − s)

That is, adding two fractions with constant numerator and denominators (x − r) and (x − s) produces a
fraction with denominator (x − r)(x − s) and a polynomial of degree less than 2 for the numerator. We
want to reverse this process: Starting with a single fraction, we want to write it as a sum of two simpler
fractions. An example should make it clear how to proceed.

A
B

.
(x − 2)(x + 3) x − 2 x + 3

If we go ahead and add the fractions on the right hand side, we seek a common denominator, and get:
(A + B)x + 3A − 2B
7x − 6
=
.
(x − 2)(x + 3)
(x − 2)(x + 3)
So all we need to do is find A and B so that 7x − 6 = (A + B)x + 3A − 2B, which is to say, we need
7 = A + B and −6 = 3A − 2B. This is a problem you’ve seen before: Solve a system of two equations
in two unknowns. There are many ways to proceed; here’s one: If 7 = A + B then B = 7 − A and so
−6 = 3A − 2B = 3A − 2(7 − A) = 3A − 14 + 2A = 5A − 14. This is easy to solve for A: A = 8/5, and then
B = 7 − A = 7 − 8/5 = 27/5. Thus

7.6 Numerical Integration
We have now seen some of the most generally useful methods for discovering antiderivatives, and there
are others. Unfortunately, some functions have no simple antiderivatives. In such cases, if the value of a
definite integral is needed it will have to be approximated. We will see two methods that work reasonably
well and yet are fairly simple; in some cases more sophisticated techniques will be needed.
Of course, we already know one way to approximate an integral: If we think of the integral as computing an area, we can add up the areas of some rectangles. While this is quite simple, it is usually the case
that a large number of rectangles is needed to get acceptable accuracy. A similar approach is much better.
We approximate the area under a curve over a small interval as the area of a trapezoid. In figure 7.1 we
see an area under a curve approximated by rectangles and by trapezoids; it is apparent that the trapezoids
give a substantially better approximation on each subinterval.

Figure 7.1: Approximating an area with rectangles and with trapezoids.
As with rectangles, we divide the interval into n equal subintervals of length ∆x. A typical trapezoid is
pictured in figure 7.2; it has area
f (xi ) + f (xi+1 )
∆x.

Figure 7.2: A single trapezoid.
In practice, an approximation is useful only if we know how accurate it is; for example, we might need
a particular value accurate to three decimal places. When we compute a particular approximation to an
integral, the error is the difference between the approximation and the true value of the integral. For any
approximation technique, we need an error bound, a value that is guaranteed to be larger than the actual
error. If A is an approximation and E is the associated error bound, then we know that the true value of the
integral is between A − E and A + E. In the case of our approximation of the integral, we want E = E(∆x)
to be a function of ∆x that gets small rapidly as ∆x gets small. Fortunately, for many functions, there is
such an error bound associated with the trapezoid approximation.
Theorem 7.38: Error for Trapezoid Approximation

Suppose f has a second derivative f ′′ everywhere on the interval [a, b], and | f ′′ (x)| ≤ M for all x in
the interval. With ∆x = (b − a)/n, an error bound for the trapezoid approximation is
E(∆x) =

b−a
(b − a)3
M(∆x)2 =
M.
12
12n2

Let’s see how we can use this.
Example 7.39: Approximate an Integral With Trapezoids

Approximate

2

e−x dx to two decimal places.

Solution. The second derivative of f = e−x is (4x2 − 2)e−x , and it is not hard to see that on [0, 1] | f ′′ (x)|
has a maximum value of 2, thus we begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need.
To get two decimal places of accuracy, we will certainly need E(∆x) < 0.005 or

Techniques of Integration

With n = 6, the error bound is thus 1/63 < 0.0047. We compute the trapezoid approximation for six
intervals:


f (0)
f (1) 1
+ f (1/6) + f (2/6) + · · · + f (5/6) +
≈ 0.74512.
2
2
6

So the true value of the integral is between 0.74512 − 0.0047 = 0.74042 and 0.74512 + 0.0047 = 0.74982.
Unfortunately, the first rounds to 0.74 and the second rounds to 0.75, so we can’t be sure of the correct
value in the second decimal place; we need to pick a larger n. As it turns out, we need to go to n =
12 to get two bounds that both round to the same value, which turns out to be 0.75. For comparison,
using 12 rectangles to approximate the area gives 0.7727, which is considerably less accurate than the
approximation using six trapezoids.
In practice it generally pays to start by requiring better than the maximum possible error; for example,
we might have initially required E(∆x) < 0.001, or

Had we immediately tried n = 13 this would have given us the desired answer.

♣

The trapezoid approximation works well, especially compared to rectangles, because the tops of the
trapezoids form a reasonably good approximation to the curve when ∆x is fairly small. We can extend this
idea: what if we try to approximate the curve more closely by using something other than a straight line?
The obvious candidate is a parabola: If we can approximate a short piece of the curve with a parabola with
equation y = ax2 + bx + c, we can easily compute the area under the parabola.
There are an infinite number of parabolas through any two given points, but only one through three
given points. If we find a parabola through three consecutive points (xi , f (xi )), (xi+1 , f (xi+1 )), (xi+2 , f (xi+2 ))
on the curve, it should be quite close to the curve over the whole interval [xi , xi+2 ], as in Figure 7.3. If
we divide the interval [a, b] into an even number of subintervals, we can then approximate the curve by
a sequence of parabolas, each covering two of the subintervals. For this to be practical, we would like a
simple formula for the area under one parabola, namely, the parabola through (xi , f (xi )), (xi+1 , f (xi+1 )),
and (xi+2 , f (xi+2 )). That is, we should attempt to write down the parabola y = ax2 + bx + c through these
points and then integrate it, and hope that the result is fairly simple. Although the algebra involved is
messy, this turns out to be possible. The algebra is well within the capability of a good computer algebra
system like Sage, so we will present the result without all of the algebra.
To find the parabola, we solve these three equations for a, b, and c:
f (xi ) = a(xi+1 − ∆x)2 + b(xi+1 − ∆x) + c
f (xi+1 ) = a(xi+1 )2 + b(xi+1 ) + c
f (xi+2 ) = a(xi+1 + ∆x)2 + b(xi+1 + ∆x) + c
Not surprisingly, the solutions turn out to be quite messy. Nevertheless, Sage can easily compute and
simplify the integral to get
Z xi+1 +∆x
xi+1 −∆x

ax2 + bx + c dx =

∆x
( f (xi ) + 4 f (xi+1 ) + f (xi+2 )).
3

7.6. Numerical Integration

Now the sum of the areas under all parabolas is
∆x
( f (x0 ) + 4 f (x1 ) + f (x2 ) + f (x2 ) + 4 f (x3 ) + f (x4 ) + · · · + f (xn−2 ) + 4 f (xn−1 ) + f (xn )) =

3
This is just slightly more complicated than the formula for trapezoids; we need to remember the alternating 2 and 4 coefficients, and that the interval must be divided into an even number of subintervals. This
approximation technique is referred to as Simpson’s Rule.

Suppose f has a fourth derivative f (4) everywhere on the interval [a, b], and | f (4) (x)| ≤ M for all x

Solution. The fourth derivative of f = e−x is (16x4 −48x2 +12)e−x ; on [0, 1] this is at most 12 in absolute
value. We begin by estimating the number of subintervals we are likely to need. To get two decimal places
of accuracy, we will certainly need E(∆x) < 0.005, but taking a cue from our earlier example, let’s require

So we try n = 4, since we need an even number of subintervals. Then the error bound is 12/180/44 <
0.0003 and the approximation is
( f (0) + 4 f (1/4) + 2 f (1/2) + 4 f (3/4) + f (1))

So the true value of the integral is between 0.746855 − 0.0003 = 0.746555 and 0.746855 + 0.0003 =
0.7471555, both of which round to 0.75.

Exercise 7.6.11 Using Simpson’s rule on a parabola f (x), even with just two subintervals, gives the exact
value of the integral, because the parabolas used to approximate f will be f itself. Remarkably, Simpson’s

interval [a, b], then

f (x) dx = F(x) = F(b) − F(a),

answer by looking at the graph of f (x) = 1/x2 on [−1, 1]. The shaded area appears to grow without bound
as seen in the figure below.

♣
Formalizing this example leads to the concept of an improper integral. There are two ways to extend
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. One is to use an infinite interval, i.e., [a, ∞), (−∞, b] or (−∞, ∞).
The second is to allow the interval [a, b] to contain an infinite discontinuity of f (x). In either case,
the integral is called an improper integral. One of the most important applications of this concept is
probability distributions.
To compute improper integrals, we use the concept of limits along with the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus.
Definition 7.43: Definitions for Improper Integrals

If f (x) is continuous on [a, ∞), then the improper integral of f over [a, ∞) is:
Z ∞

f (x) dx := lim

If f (x) is continuous on (−∞, b], then the improper integral of f over (−∞, b] is:

R→−∞ R

f (x) dx.

If the limit exists and is a finite number, we say the improper integral converges. Otherwise, we say
the improper integral diverges.
To get
Z an intuitive (though not completely correct) interpretation of improper integrals, we attempt to
∞

analyze

a

f (x) dx graphically. Here assume f (x) is continuous on [a, ∞):

integral:
Z ∞

f (x) dx := lim

Z R

R→∞ a

f (x) dx.

We can then apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to the last integral as f (x) is continuous on the
closed interval [a, R].
We next define the improper integral for the interval (−∞, ∞).
Definition 7.44: Definitions for Improper Integrals

When there is a discontinuity in [a, b] or at an endpoint, then the improper integral is as follows.

8.1 Distance, Velocity, Acceleration
We recall a general principle that will later be applied to distance-velocity-acceleration problems, among
other things. If F(u) is an anti-derivative of f (u), then

Z b

f (u) du = F(b) − F(a). Suppose that we want

Z x

f (u) du.

a

to let the upper limit of integration vary, i.e., we replace b by some variable x. We think of a as a fixed
starting value x0 . In this new notation the last equation (after adding F(a) to both sides) becomes:
F(x) = F(x0 ) +

x0

Here u is the variable of integration, called a “dummy variable,” since it is not the variable in the function
F(x). In general, it is
Z not a good idea to use the same letter as a variable of integration and as a limit of
x

integration. That is,

x0

f (x)dx is bad notation, and can lead to errors and confusion.

An important application of this principle occurs when we are interested in the position of an object at
time t (say, on the x-axis) and we know its position at time t0 . Let s(t) denote the position of the object
at time t (its distance from a reference point, such as the origin on the x-axis). Then the net change in
position between t0 and t is s(t) − s(t0). Since s(t) is an anti-derivative of the velocity function v(t), we
can write
Z t
s(t) = s(t0) + v(u)du.
t0

Similarly, since the velocity is an anti-derivative of the acceleration function a(t), we have
v(t) = v(t0 ) +

Z t

a(u)du.

t0

Example 8.1: Constant Force

Suppose an object is acted upon by a constant force F . Find v(t) and s(t).
Solution. By Newton’s law F = ma, so the acceleration is F/m, where m is the mass of the object. Then
we first have
Z t

v(t) = v(t0) +

For instance, when F/m = −g is the constant of gravitational acceleration, then this is the falling body
formula (if we neglect air resistance) familiar from elementary physics:
g
s0 + v0 (t − t0 ) − (t − t0 )2 ,

or in the common case that t0 = 0,

g
s0 + v0t − t 2.

♣

Recall that the integral of the velocity function gives the net distance traveled. If you want to know
the total distance traveled, you must find out where the velocity function crosses the t-axis, integrate
separately over the time intervals when v(t) is positive and when v(t) is negative, and add up the absolute
values of the different integrals. For example, if an object is thrown straight upward at 19.6 m/sec, its
velocity function is v(t) = −9.8t + 19.6, using g = 9.8 m/sec for the force of gravity. This is a straight line
which is positive for t < 2 and negative for t > 2. The net distance traveled in the first 4 seconds is thus
Z 4
0

(−9.8t + 19.6)dt = 0,

while the total distance traveled in the first 4 seconds is

The acceleration of an object is given by a(t) = cos(π t), and its velocity at time t = 0 is 1/(2π ).
Find both the net and the total distance traveled in the first 1.5 seconds.

To find the total distance traveled, we need to know when (0.5+sin(π t)) is positive and when it is negative.
This function is 0 when sin(π t) is −0.5, i.e., when π t = 7π /6, 11π /6, etc. The value π t = 7π /6, i.e.,
t = 7/6, is the only value in the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.5. Since v(t) > 0 for t < 7/6 and v(t) < 0 for t > 7/6, the

Applications of Integration

8.2 Area Between Curves
We have seen how integration can be used to find an area between a curve and the x-axis. With very little
change we can find some areas between curves; indeed, the area between a curve and the x-axis may be
interpreted as the area between the curve and a second “curve” with equation y = 0.
Suppose we would like to find the area below f (x) = −x2 + 4x + 3 and above g(x) = −x3 + 7x2 −
10x + 5 over the interval 1 ≤ x ≤ 2. We can approximate the area between two curves by dividing the area
into thin sections and approximating the area of each section by a rectangle, as indicated in figure 8.1. The
area of a typical rectangle is ∆x( f (xi ) − g(xi )), so the total area is approximately
n−1

∑ ( f (xi) − g(xi))∆x.

i=0

This is exactly the sort of sum that turns into an integral in the limit, namely the integral

Solution. Here we are not given a specific interval, so it must be the case that there is a “natural” region

Figure 8.2: Area bounded by two curves.
Some general guidelines to compute the area between two curves follows.
Guidelines for Area Between Two Curves
1. Find the intersection points.
2. Draw a sketch of the two curves.
3. Using the sketch determine which curve is the top curve and which curve is the bottom curve.
You may need to split the area up into multiple regions if the curves intersect multiple times
in [a, b].
4. Put the above information into the appropriate formula (once for each region):
Area =

Z b
a

(top curve) − (bottom curve) dx,

a ≤ x ≤ b.

5. Evaluate the integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (you should get a positive
number representing an area).

Example 8.4: Area Between Two Curves

Determine the area enclosed by y = x2 , y =

√

x, x = 0 and x = 2.

Solution. The points of intersection of y = x2 and y = x are
√
x2 = x
→
x4 = x
→
x4 − x = 0

→

x(x3 − 1) = 0.

Thus, either x = 0 or x = 1. Sketching the curves gives:

The area we want to compute is the shaded region. Since the top curve
√ changes at x = 1, we need to use
the formula twice. For A1 we have a = 0, b = 1, the top curve is y = x and the√bottom curve is y = x2 .
For A2 we have a = 1, b = 2, the top curve is y = x2 and the bottom curve is y = x.

Figure 8.3: Volume of a pyramid approximated by rectangular prisms.

Example 8.7: Volume of a Pyramid

Find the volume of a pyramid with a square base that is 20 meters tall and 20 meters on a side at the
base.
Solution. As with most of our applications of integration, we begin by asking how we might approximate
the volume. Since we can easily compute the volume of a rectangular prism (that is, a “box”), we will
use some boxes to approximate the volume of the pyramid, as shown in figure 8.3: On the left is a crosssectional view, on the right is a 3D view of part of the pyramid with some of the boxes used to approximate
the volume.
Each box has volume of the form (2xi )(2xi )∆y. Unfortunately, there are two variables here; fortunately,
we can write x in terms of y: From the cross-sectional view we see that a height of 20 is achieved at the
midpoint of the base. We will also position the cross-sectional view symmetrically about the y-axis. Thus
at x = 0, y = 20, and we have a slope of m = −2. So
y = −2x + b
20 = −2(0) + b
20 = b.

8.3. Volume

313

Therefore, y = 20 − 2x, and in the terms of x: x = 10 − y/2 or xi = 10 − yi /2. Then the total volume is
approximately
n−1

∑ 4(10 − yi/2)2∆y

and in the limit we get the volume as the value of an integral:

As you may know, the volume of a pyramid is (1/3)(height)(area of base) = (1/3)(20)(400), which
agrees with our answer.

The base of a solid is the region between f (x) = x2 − 1 and g(x) = −x2 + 1, and its cross-sections
perpendicular to the x-axis are equilateral triangles, as indicated in Figure 8.4. The solid has been
truncated to show a triangular cross-section above x = 1/2. Find the volume of the solid.

Figure 8.4: Solid with equilateral triangles as cross-sections.
Solution. A cross-section at a value xi on the x-axis is a triangle with base 2(1 −x2i ) and height
so the area of the cross-section is
√

(base)(height) = (1 − x2i ) 3(1 − x2i ),

and the volume of a thin “slab” is then
√
(1 − x2i ) 3(1 − x2i )∆x.
Thus the total volume is

One easy way to get “nice” cross-sections is by rotating a plane figure around a line. For example, in
Figure 8.5 we see a plane region under a curve and between two vertical lines; then the result of rotating
this around the x-axis, and a typical circular cross-section is a circle.

Figure 8.5: A solid of rotation.
Of course a real “slice” of this figure will not have straight sides, but we can approximate the volume
of the slice by a cylinder or disk with circular top and bottom and straight sides; the volume of this disk
will have the form π r2 ∆x. As long as we can write r in terms of x we can compute the volume by an
integral.
Example 8.9: Volume of a Right Circular Cone

Find the volume of a right circular cone with base radius 10 and height 20. (A right circular cone is
one with a circular base and with the tip of the cone directly over the center of the base.)
Solution. We can view this cone as produced by the rotation of the line y = x/2 rotated about the x-axis,
as indicated in figure 8.6.

Example 8.10: Volume of an Object with a Hole

Find the volume of the object generated when the area between y = x2 and y = x is rotated around
the x-axis.
Solution. This solid has a “hole” in the middle; we can compute the volume by subtracting the volume
of the hole from the volume enclosed by the outer surface of the solid. In figure 8.7 we show the region
that is rotated, the resulting solid with the front half cut away, the cone that forms the outer surface, the
horn-shaped hole, and a cross-section perpendicular to the x-axis.

Figure 8.7: Solid with a hole, showing the outer cone and the shape to be removed to form the hole.
We have already computed the volume of a cone; in this case it is π /3. At a particular value of x, say
xi , the cross-section of the horn is a circle with radius x2i , so the volume of the horn is

so the desired volume is π /3 − π /5 = 2π /15.
As with the area between curves, there is an alternate approach that computes the desired volume “all
at once” by approximating the volume of the actual solid. We can approximate the volume of a slice of
the solid with a washer-shaped volume, as indicated in Figure 8.7.
The volume of such a washer is the area of the face times the thickness. The thickness, as usual, is ∆x,
while the area of the face is the area of the outer circle minus the area of the inner circle, say π R2 − π r2 , or
π (TOP)2 − π (BOTTOM)2 . In the present example, at a particular xi , the radius R (The “TOP” function)
is xi and r (The “BOTTOM” function) x2i . Hence, the whole volume is

Of course, what we have done here is exactly the same calculation as before, except we have in effect

8.3. Volume

Suppose the region between f (x) = x + 1 and g(x) = (x − 1)2 is rotated around the y-axis; see Figure 8.8. It is possible, but inconvenient, to compute the volume of the resulting solid by the method we
have used so far. The problem is that there are two “kinds” of typical rectangles: Those that go from the
line to the parabola and those that touch the parabola on both ends. To compute the volume using this
approach, we need to break the problem into two parts and compute two integrals:

π

If instead we consider a typical vertical rectangle, but still rotate around the y-axis, we get a thin “shell”
instead of a thin “washer”. Note that “washers” are related to the area of a circle, π r2 , whereas “shells”
are related to the surface area of a cylinder, 2π rh. If we add up the volume of such thin shells we will get
an approximation to the true volume. What is the volume of such a shell? Consider the shell at xi . Imagine
that we cut the shell vertically in one place and “unroll” it into a thin, flat sheet, namely the surface of a
cylinder. This sheet will be almost a rectangular prism that is ∆x thick, f (xi ) − g(xi ) (TOP−BOTTOM)
tall, and 2π xi wide. The volume will then be approximately the volume of a rectangular prism with these
dimensions: 2π xi ( f (xi ) − g(xi ))∆x. If we add these up and take the limit as usual, we get the integral
Z 3

2π x( f (x) − g(x)) dx =

2π x (TOP − BOTTOM) dx =

2π x(x + 1 − (x − 1)2 ) dx =

Not only does this accomplish the task with only one integral, the integral is somewhat easier than those in
the previous calculation. Things are not always so neat, but it is often the case that one of the two methods
will be simpler than the other, so it is worth considering both before starting to do calculations.

8.4 Average Value of a Function
The average of some finite set of values is a familiar concept. If, for example, the class scores on a quiz
are 10, 9, 10, 8, 7, 5, 7, 6, 3, 2, 7, 8, then the average score is the sum of these numbers divided by the size
of the class:
10 + 9 + 10 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 7 + 8 82
average score =

≈ 6.83.

Suppose that between t = 0 and t = 1 the speed of an object is sin(π t). What is the average speed of the
object over that time? The question sounds as if it must make sense, yet we can’t merely add up some
number of speeds and divide, since the speed is changing continuously over the time interval.
To make sense of “average” in this context, we fall back on the idea of approximation. Consider the
speed of the object at tenth of a second intervals: sin 0, sin(0.1π ), sin(0.2π ), sin(0.3π ),. . . , sin(0.9π ). The
average speed “should” be fairly close to the average of these ten speeds:
1 9
1
sin(π i/10) ≈ 6.3 = 0.63.
∑
10 i=0
10
Of course, if we compute more speeds at more times, the average of these speeds should be closer to the
“real” average. If we take the average of n speeds at evenly spaced times, we get:
1 n−1
∑ sin(π i/n).
n i=0

320

Applications of Integration

Here the individual times are ti = i/n, so rewriting slightly we have
1 n−1
∑ sin(π ti).
n i=0
This is almost the sort of sum that we know turns into an integral; what’s apparently missing is ∆t—but in
fact, ∆t = 1/n, the length of each subinterval. So rewriting again:
n−1

n−1

1

∑ sin(π ti) n = ∑ sin(π ti)∆t.

i=0

Now this has exactly the right form, so that in the limit we get

It’s not entirely obvious from this one simple example how to compute such an average in general.
Let’s look at a somewhat more complicated case. Suppose that the velocity of an object is 16t 2 + 5 feet
per second. What is the average velocity between t = 1 and t = 3? Again we set up an approximation to
the average:
1 n−1 2
∑ 16ti + 5,
n i=0
where the values ti are evenly spaced times between 1 and 3. Once again we are “missing” ∆t, and this
time 1/n is not the correct value. What is ∆t in general? It is the length of a subinterval; in this case we
take the interval [1, 3] and divide it into n subintervals, so each has length (3 − 1)/n = 2/n = ∆t. Now with
the usual “multiply and divide by the same thing” trick we can rewrite the sum:
1 n−1 2
1 n−1
3 − 1 1 n−1
2 1 n−1

Does this seem reasonable? Let’s picture it: In Figure 8.10 we see the velocity function together with the
horizontal line y = 223/3 ≈ 74.3. Certainly the height of the horizontal line looks at least plausible for the
average height of the curve.

Figure 8.10: Average velocity.
Here’s another way to interpret “average” that may make our computation appear even more reasonable. The object of our example goes a certain distance between t = 1 and t = 3. If instead the object were
to travel at the average speed over the same time, it should go the same distance. At an average speed of
223/3 feet per second for two seconds the object would go 446/3 feet. How far does it actually go? We
know how to compute this:
Z 3
Z 3
446
.
v(t) dt =
16t 2 + 5 dt =
3
1
1
So now we see that another interpretation of the calculation is:
1
2

Z 3
1

16t 2 + 5 dt =

1 446 223
=
2 3
3

which is the total distance traveled divided by the time in transit, namely, the usual interpretation of average
speed.
In the case of speed, or more properly velocity, we can always interpret “average” as total (net) distance divided by time. However, in the case of a different sort of quantity this interpretation does not
obviously apply, while the approximation approach always does. We might interpret the same problem
geometrically: What is the average height of 16x2 +5 on the interval [1, 3]? We approximate this in exactly
the same way, by adding up many sample heights and dividing by the number of samples. In the limit we
get the same result:
Z
1 n−1
1 3
1 446 223
2
16x2 + 5 dx =
=
.
lim ∑ 16xi + 5 =
n→∞ n
2 1
2 3
3
i=0
We can interpret this result in a slightly different way. The area under y = 16x2 + 5 above [1, 3] is
Z 3
1

16t 2 + 5 dt =

446
.
3

The area under y = 223/3 over the same interval [1, 3] is simply the area of a rectangle that is 2 by 223/3
with area 446/3. So the average height of a function is the height of the horizontal line that produces the
same area over the given interval.

8.5 Work
A fundamental concept in classical physics is work: If an object is moved in a straight line against a force
F for a distance d the work done is W = Fd.
Example 8.12: Constant Force

How much work is done in lifting a 10 pound weight vertically a distance of 5 feet?
Solution. The force due to gravity on a 10 pound weight is 10 pounds at the surface of the earth, and it
does not change appreciably over 5 feet. The work done is W = 10 · 5 = 50 foot-pounds.
♣
In reality few situations are so simple. The force might not be constant over the range of motion, as in
the next example.
Example 8.13: Lifting a Weight

How much work is done in lifting a 10 pound weight from the surface of the earth to an orbit 100
miles above the surface?
Solution. Over 100 miles the force due to gravity does change significantly, so we need to take this into
account. The force exerted on a 10 pound weight at a distance r from the center of the earth is F = k/r2
and by definition it is 10 when r is the radius of the earth (we assume the earth is a sphere). How can we

8.5. Work

323

approximate the work done? We divide the path from the surface to orbit into n small subpaths. On each
subpath the force due to gravity is roughly constant, with value k/ri2 at distance ri . The work to raise the
object from ri to ri+1 is thus approximately k/ri2 ∆r and the total work is approximately
n−1

Using r0 = 20925525 feet we have r1 = 21453525. The force on the 10 pound weight at the surface of the

Note that if we assume the force due to gravity is 10 pounds over the whole distance we would calculate
the work as 10(r1 − r0 ) = 10 · 100 · 5280 = 5280000, somewhat higher since we don’t account for the
weakening of the gravitational force.
♣
Example 8.14: Lifting an Object

How much work is done in lifting a 10 kilogram object from the surface of the earth to a distance D
from the center of the earth?
Solution. This is the same problem as before in different units, and we are not specifying a value for D.

While “weight in pounds” is a measure of force, “weight in kilograms” is a measure of mass. To convert
to force we need to use Newton’s law F = ma. At the surface of the earth the acceleration due to gravity
is approximately 9.8 meters per second squared, so the force is F = 10 · 9.8 = 98. The units here are
“kilogram-meters per second squared” or “kg m/s2”, also known as a Newton (N), so F = 98 N. The
radius of the earth is approximately 6378.1 kilometers or 6378100 meters. Now the problem proceeds as
before. From F = k/r2 we compute k: 98 = k/63781002, k = 3.986655642 · 1015. Then the work is:
W =−

k
+ 6.250538000 · 108
D

Newton-meters.

As D increases W of course gets larger, since the quantity being subtracted, −k/D, gets smaller. But note
that the work W will never exceed 6.250538000 · 108, and in fact will approach this value as D gets larger.
In short, with a finite amount of work, namely 6.250538000 · 108 N-m, we can lift the 10 kilogram object
as far as we wish from earth.

Next is an example in which the force is constant, but there are many objects moving different distances.
Example 8.15: Multiple Objects Moving

Suppose that a water tank is shaped like a right circular cone with the tip at the bottom, and has
height 10 meters and radius 2 meters at the top. If the tank is full, how much work is required to
pump all the water out over the top?
Solution. Here we have a large number of atoms of water that must be lifted different distances to get to
the top of the tank. Fortunately, we don’t really have to deal with individual atoms—we can consider all
the atoms at a given depth together.
To approximate the work, we can divide the water in the tank into horizontal sections, approximate the
volume of water in a section by a thin disk, and compute the amount of work required to lift each disk to
the top of the tank. As usual, we take the limit as the sections get thinner and thinner to get the total work.

Figure 8.11: Cross-section of a conical water tank.
At depth h the circular cross-section through the tank has radius r = (10 − h)/5, by similar triangles,
and area π (10 − h)2/25. A section of the tank at depth h thus has volume approximately π (10 − h)2/25∆h
and so contains σ π (10 − h)2/25∆h kilograms of water, where σ is the density of water in kilograms per
cubic meter; σ ≈ 1000. The force due to gravity on this much water is 9.8σ π (10 − h)2/25∆h, and finally,

A spring has a “natural length,” its length if nothing is stretching or compressing it. If the spring
is either stretched or compressed the spring provides an opposing force; according to Hooke’s Law the
magnitude of this force is proportional to the distance the spring has been stretched or compressed: F = kx.
The constant of proportionality, k, of course depends on the spring. Note that x here represents the change
in length from the natural length.

Example 8.16: Compressing a Spring

Suppose k = 5 for a given spring that has a natural length of 0.1 meters. Suppose a force is applied
that compresses the spring to length 0.08. What is the magnitude of the force?
Solution. Assuming that the constant k has appropriate dimensions (namely, kg/s2), the force is 5(0.1 −
0.08) = 5(0.02) = 0.1 Newtons.

to 0.08 meters? From 0.08 meters to 0.05 meters? How much work is done to stretch the spring
from 0.1 meters to 0.15 meters?
Solution. We can approximate the work by dividing the distance that the spring is compressed (or stretched)
into small subintervals. Then the force exerted by the spring is approximately constant over the subinterval, so the work required to compress the spring from xi to xi+1 is approximately 5(xi − 0.1)∆x. The total
work is approximately

8.6 Center of Mass
Suppose a beam is 10 meters long, and that there are three weights on the beam: a 10 kilogram weight 3
meters from the left end, a 5 kilogram weight 6 meters from the left end, and a 4 kilogram weight 8 meters
from the left end. Where should a fulcrum be placed so that the beam balances? Let’s assign a scale to
the beam, from 0 at the left end to 10 at the right, so that we can denote locations on the beam simply as x
coordinates; the weights are at x = 3, x = 6, and x = 8, as in Figure 8.12.

Suppose to begin with that the fulcrum is placed at x = 5. What will happen? Each weight applies a
force to the beam that tends to rotate it around the fulcrum; this effect is measured by a quantity called
torque, proportional to the mass times the distance from the fulcrum. Of course, weights on different
sides of the fulcrum rotate the beam in opposite directions. We can distinguish this by using a signed
distance in the formula for torque. So with the fulcrum at 5, the torques induced by the three weights will
be proportional to (3 − 5)10 = −20, (6 − 5)5 = 5, and (8 − 5)4 = 12. For the beam to balance, the sum of
the torques must be zero; since the sum is −20 + 5 + 12 = −3, the beam rotates counter-clockwise, and to
get the beam to balance we need to move the fulcrum to the left. To calculate exactly where the fulcrum
should be, we let x̄ denote the location of the fulcrum when the beam is in balance. The total torque on
the beam is then (3 − x̄)10 + (6 − x̄)5 + (8 − x̄)4 = 92 − 19x̄. Since the beam balances at x̄ it must be that
92 − 19x̄ = 0 or x̄ = 92/19 ≈ 4.84, that is, the fulcrum should be placed at x = 92/19 to balance the beam.
Now suppose that we have a beam with varying density—some portions of the beam contain more
mass than other portions of the same size. We want to figure out where to put the fulcrum so that the beam
balances.

Example 8.18: Balance Point of a Beam

Find the balance point of a solid beam, illustrated in Figure 8.13, assuming the beam is 10 meters
long and that the density is 1 + x kilograms per meter at location x on the beam.
Solution. To approximate the solution, we can think of the beam as a sequence of weights “on” a beam.
For example, we can think of the portion of the beam between x = 0 and x = 1 as a weight sitting at x = 0,
the portion between x = 1 and x = 2 as a weight sitting at x = 1, and so on, as indicated in Figure 8.13. We
then approximate the mass of the weights by assuming that each portion of the beam has constant density.
So the mass of the first weight is approximately m0 = (1 + 0)1 = 1 kilograms, namely, (1 + 0) kilograms
per meter times 1 meter. The second weight is m1 = (1 + 1)1 = 2 kilograms, and so on to the tenth weight
with m9 = (1 + 9)1 = 10 kilograms. So in this case the total torque is
(0 − x̄)m0 + (1 − x̄)m1 + · · · + (9 − x̄)m9 = (0 − x̄)1 + (1 − x̄)2 + · · · + (9 − x̄)10.
If we set this to zero and solve for x̄ we get x̄ = 6. In general, if we divide the beam into n portions, the
mass of weight number i will be mi = (1 + xi )(xi+1 − xi ) = (1 + xi )∆x and the torque induced by weight
number i will be (xi − x̄)mi = (xi − x̄)(1 + xi )∆x. The total torque is then
(x0 − x̄)(1 + x0 )∆x + (x1 − x̄)(1 + x1)∆x + · · · + (xn−1 − x̄)(1 + xn−1 )∆x

The denominator of this fraction has a very familiar interpretation. Consider one term of the sum in the
denominator: (1 + xi )∆x. This is the density near xi times a short length, ∆x, which in other words is
approximately the mass of the beam between xi and xi+1 . When we add these up we get approximately
the mass of the beam.
Now each of the sums in the fraction has the right form to turn into an integral, which in turn gives us
the exact value of x̄:

It should be apparent that there was nothing special about the density function σ (x) = 1 + x or the
length of the beam, or even that the left end of the beam is at the origin. In general, if the density of the

density at the left end is 20 − 19 = 1 and at the right end is 30 − 19 = 11, as before. Hence the center of

Example 8.20: Centroid of a Flat Plate

Suppose a flat plate of uniform density has the shape contained by y = x2 , y = 1, and x = 0, in the
first quadrant. Find the center of mass. (Since the density is constant, the center of mass depends
only on the shape of the plate, not the density, or in other words, this is a purely geometric quantity.
In such a case the center of mass is called the centroid.)
Solution. This is a two dimensional problem, but it can be solved as if it were two one dimensional
problems: we need to find the x and y coordinates of the center of mass, x̄ and ȳ, and fortunately we can do
these independently. Imagine looking at the plate edge on, from below the x-axis. The plate will appear to
be a beam, and the mass of a short section of the “beam”, say between xi and xi+1 , is the mass of a strip of
the plate between xi and xi+1 . See Figure 8.14 showing the plate from above and as it appears edge on.

We already know how to compute one simple arc length, that of a line segment. If q
the endpoints are
P0 (x0 , y0 ) and P1 (x1 , y1 ) then the length of the segment is the distance between the points, (x1 − x0 )2 + (y1 − y0 )2 ,
from the Pythagorean theorem, as illustrated in Figure 8.15.

a portion of the curve with line segments, and that as the number of segments increases, and their lengths
decrease, the sum of the lengths of the line segments will approach the true arc length; see Figure 8.16.

Figure 8.16: Approximating arc length with line segments.
Now we need to write a formula for the sum of the lengths of the line segments, in a form that we know
becomes an integral in the limit. So we suppose we have divided the interval [a, b] into n subintervals as
usual, each with length ∆x = (b − a)/n, and endpointsq
a = x0 , x1 , x2 , . . . , xn = b. The length of a typical

line segment, joining (xi , f (xi )) to (xi+1 , f (xi+1 )), is (∆x)2 + ( f (xi+1 ) − f (xi ))2 . By the Mean Value
Theorem, there is a number ti in (xi , xi+1 ) such that f ′ (ti)∆x = f (xi+1 ) − f (xi ), so the length of the line
segment can be written as
q

(∆x) + ( f (ti)) ∆x = 1 + ( f ′ (ti ))2 ∆x.

Note that the sum looks a bit different than others we have encountered, because the approximation contains a ti instead of an xi . In the past we have always used left endpoints (namely, xi ) to get a representative
value of f on [xi , xi+1 ]; now we are using a different point, but the principle is the same.

To summarize, to compute the length of a curve on the interval [a, b], we compute the integral
Z bq

1 + ( f ′ (x))2 dx.

Unfortunately, integrals of this form are typically difficult or impossible to compute exactly, because
usually none of our methods for finding antiderivatives will work. In practice this means that the integral
will usually have to be approximated.
Example 8.22: Circumference of a Circle

tricky and a bit long.)

8.8 Surface Area
Another geometric question that arises naturally is: “What is the surface area of a volume?” For example,
what is the surface area of a sphere? More advanced techniques are required to approach this question in
general, but we can compute the areas of some volumes generated by revolution.
As usual, the question is: How might we approximate the surface area? For a surface obtained by
rotating a curve around an axis, we can take a polygonal approximation to the curve, as in the last section,
and rotate it around the same axis. This gives a surface composed of many “truncated cones”; a truncated
cone is called a frustum of a cone. Figure 8.17 illustrates this approximation.

Figure 8.17: Approximating a surface (left) by portions of cones (right).
So we need to be able to compute the area of a frustum of a cone. Since the frustum can be formed
by removing a small cone from the top of a larger one, we can compute the desired area if we know the
surface area of a cone. Suppose a right circular cone has base radius r and slant height h. If we cut the
cone from the vertex to the base circle and flatten it out, we obtain a sector of a circle with radius h and arc
length 2π r, as in Figure 8.18. The angle at the center, in radians, is then 2π r/h, and the area of the cone

8.8. Surface Area

is equal to the area of the sector of the circle. Let A be the area of the sector; since the area of the entire
circle is π h2 , we have
A
2π r/h

πh
2π
A = π rh.

Figure 8.18: The area of a cone.
Now suppose we have a frustum of a cone with slant height h and radii r0 and r1 , as in Figure 8.19.
The area of the entire cone is π r1 (h0 + h), and the area of the small cone is π r0 h0 ; thus, the area of the
frustum is π r1 (h0 + h) − π r0 h0 = π ((r1 − r0 )h0 + r1 h). By similar triangles,
h0 h0 + h
=
.
r0
r1
With a bit of algebra this becomes (r1 − r0 )h0 = r0 h; substitution into the area gives

π ((r1 − r0 )h0 + r1 h) = π (r0h + r1 h) = π h(r0 + r1 ) = 2π

r0 + r1
h = 2π rh.
2

The final form is particularly easy to remember, with r equal to the average of r0 and r1 , as it is also the
formula for the area of a cylinder. (Think of a cylinder of radius r and height h as the frustum of a cone of
infinite height.)

Figure 8.19: The area of a frustum.
Now we are ready to approximate the area of a surface of revolution. On one subinterval, the situation
is as shown in Figure 8.20. When the line joining two points on the curve is rotated around the x-axis, it
forms a frustum of a cone. The area is
q
f (xi ) + f (xi+1 )
2π rh = 2π
1 + ( f ′ (ti))2 ∆x.
2
q
Here 1 + ( f ′ (ti ))2 ∆x is the length of the line segment, as we found in the previous section. Assuming f
is a continuous function, there must be some x∗i in [xi , xi+1 ] such that ( f (xi ) + f (xi+1 ))/2 = f (x∗i ), so the
approximation for the surface area is
q
n−1

∑ 2π f (xi ) 1 + ( f ′(ti))2 ∆x.

This is not quite the sort of sum we have seen before, as it contains two different values in the interval

The dots at the end indicate that the sum goes on forever. Does this make sense? Can we assign a
numerical value to an infinite sum? While at first it may seem difficult or impossible, we have certainly
done something similar when we talked about one quantity getting “closer and closer” to a fixed quantity.
Here we could ask whether, as we add more and more terms, the sum gets closer and closer to some fixed
value. That is, look at

Sequences and Series

A related notion that will aid our investigations is that of a sequence. A sequence is just an ordered
(possibly infinite) list of numbers. For example,
1 1
1
1, , , . . . , , . . .
2 3
n
We will begin by learning some useful facts about sequences.

9.1 Sequences
While the idea of a sequence of numbers, a1 , a2 , a3 , . . . is straightforward, it is useful to think of a sequence
as a function. We have dealt with functions whose domains are the real numbers, or a subset of the real
numbers, like f (x) = sin x. A sequence can be regarded as a function with domain as the natural numbers
N = {1, 2, 3, . . .} or the non-negative integers, Z≥0 = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}. The range of the function is still
allowed to be the set of all real numbers; we say that a sequence is a function f : N → R. Sequences are
commonly denoted in several different, but equally acceptable ways:
a1 , a2 , a3 , . . .
{an }∞
n=1

{ f (n)}∞
n=1
As with functions of the real numbers, we will most often encounter sequences that can be expressed
by a formula. We have already seen the sequence ai = f (i) = 1 − 1/2i . Some other simple examples are:
i
i+1
1
f (n) = n
2
f (n) = sin(nπ /6)
(i − 1)(i + 2)
f (i) =
2i
f (i) =

Frequently these formulas will make sense if thought of either as functions with domain R or N, though
occasionally one will make sense for integer values only.
The main question of interest when dealing with sequences is what happens to the terms as we go
further and further down the list. In particular, as i becomes extremely large, does ai get closer to one
specific value? This is reminiscent of a question we asked in Chapter 3, when looking at limits of functions. In fact, the problems are closely related and we define the limit of a sequence in a way similar to
Definition 3.16.
Definition 9.1: Limit of a Sequence

Suppose that {an }∞
n=1 is a sequence. We say that lim an = L if for every ε > 0 there is an N > 0 so
n→∞

that whenever n > N , |an −L| < ε. If lim an = L we say that the sequence converges to L, otherwise
n→∞
it diverges.

9.1. Sequences

341

Intuitively, limn→∞ a2 = L means that the further we go in the sequence, the closer the terms get to L.
Example 9.2: Exponential Sequence

Show that {21/n }∞
n=1 converges to 1.
Solution. Suppose ε > 0. Then let N =

1
log2 (1+ε ) .

Note that N > 0. Now if n > N, then

1
log2 (1 + ε )
1
log2 (1 + ε ) >
n
1 + ε > 21/n
n>

ε > 21/n − 1

ε > 21/n − 1
♣
Note that, as in Chapter 3, we generally need to work “backwards” from the last line of the proof to
determine how to choose N. Having done so, we write the actual proof as we have done here to show that
this value of N ‘works’.
If a sequence is defined by a formula { f (i)}∞
i=1 , we can often expand the domain of the function f to
the set of all (or almost all) real numbers. For example, f (i) = 1i is defined for all non-zero real numbers.
When this happens, we can sometimes find the limit of the sequence { f (i)}∞
i=1 more easily by finding
the limit of the function f (x), x ∈ R, as x approaches infinity.
Theorem 9.3: Limit of a Sequence

If limx→∞ f (x) = L, where f : R → R, then { f (i)}∞
i=1 converges to L.
Proof. This follows immediately from Definitions 3.16 and 9.1.

♣

Hereafter we will use the convention that x refers to a real-valued variable and i and n are integervalued.
Example 9.4: Sequence of 1/n

Show that { n1 }∞
n=0 converges to 0.
Solution. Since limx→∞ 1x = 0, limn→∞ 1n = 0.
Note that the converse of Theorem 9.3 is not true.
Let f (n) = sin(nπ ). This is the sequence
sin(0π ), sin(1π ), sin(2π ), sin(3π ), . . . = 0, 0, 0, 0, . . .

♣

342

Sequences and Series

since sin(nπ ) = 0 when n is an integer. Thus lim f (n) = 0. But lim f (x), when x is real, does not exist:
n→∞

x→∞

as x gets bigger and bigger, the values sin(xπ ) do not get closer and closer to a single value, but take on
all values between −1 and 1 over and over. In general, whenever you want to know lim f (n) you should
n→∞

first attempt to compute lim f (x), since if the latter exists it is also equal to the first limit. But if for some
x→∞

reason lim f (x) does not exist, it may still be true that lim f (n) exists, but you’ll have to figure out another
x→∞
n→∞
way to compute it.
It is occasionally useful to think of the graph of a sequence. Since the function is defined only for
integer values, the graph is just a sequence of points. In Figure 9.1 we see the graphs of two sequences
and the graphs of the corresponding real functions.

Not surprisingly, the properties of limits of real functions translate into properties of sequences quite
easily. Theorem 3.8 about limits becomes:

Let r be a fixed real number. Determine when {rn }∞

Solution. A particularly common and useful sequence is {rn }∞
n=0 , for various values of r. Some are quite
easy to understand: If r = 1 the sequence converges to 1 since every term is 1, and likewise if r = 0 the
sequence converges to 0. If r = −1 this is the sequence of Example 9.10 and diverges. If r > 1 or r < −1
the terms rn get large without limit, so the sequence diverges. If 0 < r < 1 then the sequence converges to
n ∞

Sequences of this form, or the more general form {krn }∞
n=0 , are called geometric sequences or geometric progressions. They are encountered in a large variety of mathematical and real-world applications.
Sometimes we will not be able to determine the limit of a sequence, but we still would like to know
whether it converges. In some cases we can determine this even without being able to compute the limit.
A sequence is called increasing or sometimes strictly increasing if ai < ai+1 for all i. It is called
non-decreasing or sometimes (unfortunately) increasing if ai ≤ ai+1 for all i. Similarly a sequence is
decreasing if ai > ai+1 for all i and non-increasing if ai ≥ ai+1 for all i. If a sequence has any of these
properties it is called monotonic.

is decreasing.
A sequence is bounded above if there is some number N such that an ≤ N for every n, and bounded
below if there is some number N such that an ≥ N for every n. If a sequence is bounded above and bounded
below it is bounded. If a sequence {an }∞
n=0 is increasing or non-decreasing it is bounded below (by a0 ),
and if it is decreasing or non-increasing it is bounded above (by a0 ). Finally, with all this new terminology
we can state an important theorem.
Theorem 9.15: Bounded Monotonic Sequence

If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it converges.
We will not prove this, but the proof appears in many calculus books. It is not hard to believe: suppose
that a sequence is increasing and bounded, so each term is larger than the one before, yet never larger
than some fixed value N. The terms must then get closer and closer to some value between a0 and N. It
need not be N, since N may be a “too-generous” upper bound; the limit will be the smallest number that
is above all of the terms ai .
Example 9.16:

Determine whether



i=1

Solution. For every i ≥ 1 we have 0 < (2i − 1)/2i < 1, so the sequence is bounded, and we have already
observed that it is necessary. Therefore, the sequence converges.
♣
We don’t actually need to know that a sequence is monotonic to apply this theorem—it is enough to
know that the sequence is “eventually” monotonic, that is, that at some point it becomes increasing or
decreasing. For example, the sequence 10, 9, 8, 15, 3, 21, 4, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, 31/32, . . . is not increasing,
because among the first few terms it is not. But starting with the term 3/4 it is increasing, so the theorem
tells us that the sequence 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, 31/32, . . . converges. Since convergence depends only on what
happens as n gets large, adding a few terms at the beginning can’t turn a convergent sequence into a
divergent one.
Example 9.17:

Show that {n1/n } converges.

346

Sequences and Series

Solution. We first show that this sequence is decreasing, that is, that n1/n > (n + 1)1/(n+1) . Consider the
real function f (x) = x1/x when x ≥ 1. We can compute the derivative, f ′ (x) = x1/x (1 − ln x)/x2 , and note
that when x ≥ 3 this is negative. Since the function has negative slope, n1/n > (n + 1)1/(n+1) when n ≥ 3.
Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is decreasing and bounded when n ≥ 3, and so
the sequence converges. (As it happens, we can compute the limit in this case, but we know it converges
even without knowing the limit; see Exercise 9.1.1.)

9.2 Series
While much more can be said about sequences, we now turn to our principal interest, series. Recall that a
series, roughly speaking, is the sum of a sequence: If {an }∞
n=0 is a sequence then the associated series is
∞

∑ an = a0 + a1 + a2 + · · ·

i=0

Associated with a series is a second sequence, called the sequence of partial sums {sn }∞
n=0 :
n

s n = ∑ ai .
i=0

So
s 0 = a0 ,

s 1 = a0 + a1 ,

s 2 = a0 + a1 + a2 ,

...

A series converges if the sequence of partial sums converges, and otherwise the series diverges.
∞
i
If {kxn }∞
n=0 is a geometric sequence, then the associated series ∑i=0 kx is called a geometric series.
Theorem 9.19: Geometric Series Convergence

If |x| < 1, the geometric series ∑ kxi converges to
i

n

Proof. If an = kx ,

k

∞

∑ an is called a geometric series. A typical partial sum is

n=0

sn = k + kx + kx2 + kx3 + · · · + kxn = k(1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn ).
We note that
sn (1 − x) = k(1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn )(1 − x)

= k(1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn )1 − k(1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn−1 + xn )x

= k(1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + xn − x − x2 − x3 − · · · − xn − xn+1 )

= k(1 − xn+1 )
so

sn (1 − x) = k(1 − xn+1 )
sn = k

It is not hard to see that the following theorem follows from Theorem 9.5.
Theorem 9.20: Series are Linear

Suppose that ∑ an and ∑ bn are convergent series, and c is a constant. Then
1.
2.

∑ can is convergent and ∑ can = c ∑ an
∑(an + bn) is convergent and ∑(an + bn ) = ∑ an + ∑ bn .

Note that when c is non-zero, the converse of the first part of this theorem is also true. That is, if ∑ can
is convergent, then ∑ an is also convergent; if ∑ can converges then 1c ∑ can must converge.
On the other hand, the converse of the second part of the theorem is not true. For example, if an = 1
and bn = −1, then ∑ an + ∑ bn = ∑ 0 = 0 converges, but each of ∑ an and ∑ bn diverges.
In general, the sequence of partial sums sn is harder to understand and analyze than the sequence of
terms an , and it is difficult to determine whether series converge and if so to what. The following result
will let us deal with some simple cases easily.
Theorem 9.21: Divergence Test

If ∑ an converges then lim an = 0.
n→∞

Proof. Since ∑ an converges, lim sn = L and lim sn−1 = L, because this really says the same thing but
n→∞
n→∞
“renumbers” the terms. By Theorem 9.5,
lim (sn − sn−1 ) = lim sn − lim sn−1 = L − L = 0.

But
sn − sn−1 = (a0 + a1 + a2 + · · · + an ) − (a0 + a1 + a2 + · · · + an−1 ) = an ,
so as desired lim an = 0.

♣

n→∞

This theorem presents an easy divergence test: Given a series ∑ an , if the limit lim an does not exist or
n→∞
has a value other than zero, the series diverges. Note well that the converse is not true: If lim an = 0 then
n→∞
the series does not necessarily converge.
Theorem 9.22: The n-th Term Test

If lim an 6= 0 or if the limit does not exist, then ∑ an diverges.

Proof. Consider the statement of the theorem in contrapositive form:
∞

lim an = 0.

If sn are the partial sums of the series, then the assumption that the series converges gives us

will just get larger and larger; indeed, after a bit longer the series starts to look very much like · · · + 1 +
1 + 1 + 1 + · · · , and of course if we add up enough 1’s we can make the sum as large as we desire.

so it might be reasonable to speculate that the series converges to something in the neighborhood of 10.
But in fact the partial sums do go to infinity; they just get big very, very slowly. Consider the following:
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1
1+ + + > 1+ + + = 1+ +
2 3 4

2 3
16
2 4 4 8
8 16
16
2 2 2 2
and so on. By swallowing up more and more terms we can always manage to add at least another 1/2
to the sum, and by adding enough of these we can make the partial sums as big as we like. In fact, it’s not
hard to see from this pattern that
1 1
1
n
1+ + +···+ n > 1+ ,
2 3
2
2
so to make sure the sum is over 100, for example, we’d add up terms until we get to around 1/2198 , that
is, about 4 · 1059 terms. This series, ∑(1/n), is called the harmonic series.
♣
We will often make use of the fact that the first few (e.g. any finite number of) terms in a series are
irrelevant when determining whether it will converge. In other words, ∑∞
n=0 an converges if and only if

∑n=N an converges for some N ≥ 1.

9.3 The Integral Test
It is generally quite difficult, often impossible, to determine the value of a series exactly. In many cases
it is possible at least to determine whether or not the series converges, and so we will spend most of our
time on this problem.
If all of the terms an in a series are non-negative, then clearly the sequence of partial sums sn is
non-decreasing. This means that if we can show that the sequence of partial sums is bounded, the series
must converge. Many useful and interesting series have this property, and they are among the easiest to
understand. Let’s look at an example.
Example 9.25:
∞

Show that

1

∑ n2 converges.

n=1

Solution. The terms 1/n2 are positive and decreasing, and since lim 1/x2 = 0, the terms 1/n2 approach
x→∞
zero. We seek an upper bound for all the partial sums, that is, we want to find a number N so that sn ≤ N
for every n. The upper bound is provided courtesy of integration, and is illustrated in figure 9.2.

Figure 9.2: Graph of y = 1/x2 with rectangles.
The figure shows the graph of y = 1/x2 together with some rectangles that lie completely below the
curve and that all have base length one. Because the heights of the rectangles are determined by the height
of the curve, the areas of the rectangles are 1/12, 1/22 , 1/32 , and so on—in other words, exactly the
terms of the series. The partial sum sn is simply the sum of the areas of the first n rectangles. Because the
rectangles all lie between the curve and the x-axis, any sum of rectangle areas is less than the corresponding
area under the curve, and so of course any sum of rectangle areasRis less than the area under the entire curve.
Unfortunately, because of the asymptote at x = 0, the integral 0∞ x12 is infinite, but we can deal with this
by separating the first term from the series and integrating from 1:
n

dx = 1 + 1 = 2

(Recalling that we computed this improper integral in section 7.7). Since the sequence of partial sums sn
is increasing and bounded above by 2, we know that lim sn = L < 2, and so the series converges to some
n→∞

number less than 2. In fact, it is possible, though difficult, to show that L = π 2 /6 ≈ 1.6.

♣

We already know that ∑ 1/n diverges. What goes wrong if we try to apply this technique to it? Here’s

The problem is that the improper integral doesn’t converge. Note that this does not prove that ∑ 1/n
diverges, just that this particular calculation fails to prove that it converges. A slight modification, however,
allows us to prove in a second way that ∑ 1/n diverges.
Consider a slightly altered version of Figure 9.2, shown in Figure 9.3.

So these two examples taken together indicate that we can prove that a series converges or prove that it
diverges with a single calculation of an improper integral. This is known as the integral test, which we
state as a theorem.
Theorem 9.26: Integral Test

Suppose that f (x) > 0 and is decreasing on the infinite interval [1, ∞) and that an = f (n). Then the

The two examples we have seen are called p-series; a p-series is any series of the form ∑ 1/n p . If
p ≤ 0, lim 1/n p 6= 0, so the series diverges. For positive values of p we can determine precisely which
n→∞
series converge.
Theorem 9.27: p-Series Convergence

A p-series with p > 0 converges if and only if p > 1.
Proof. We use the integral test; we have already done p = 1, so assume that p 6= 1.

Since it is typically difficult to compute the value of a series exactly, a good approximation is frequently required. In a real sense, a good approximation is only as good as we know it is, that is, while an
approximation may in fact be good, it is only valuable in practice if we can guarantee its accuracy to some
degree. This guarantee is usually easy to come by for series with decreasing positive terms.
Example 9.31:

Approximate ∑ 1/n2 to within 0.01.
N

Solution. Referring to Figure 9.2, if we approximate the sum by

∑ 1/n2, the size of the error we make is

n=1

the total area of the remaining rectangles, all of which lie under the curve 1/x2 from x = N to infinity. So

9.3. The Integral Test

355

we know the true value of the series is larger than the approximation, and no bigger than the approximation
plus the area under the curve from N to infinity. Roughly, then, we need to find N so that

We can compute the integral:

x2

dx < 1/100.

Z ∞

so if we choose N = 100 the error will be less than 0.01. Adding up the first 100 terms gives approximately 1.634983900. In fact, we can do a bit better. Since we know that the correct value is between our
approximation and our approximation plus the error (not minus), we can cut our error bound in half by
taking the value midway between these two values. If we take N = 50, we get a sum of 1.6251327 with an
error of at most 0.02, so the correct value is between 1.6251327 and 1.6451327, and therefore the value
halfway between these, 1.6351327, is within 0.01 of the correct value. We have mentioned that the true
value of this series can be shown to be π 2 /6 ≈ 1.644934068 which is 0.0098 more than our approximation, and so (just barely) within the required error. Frequently approximations will be even better than the
♣
“guaranteed” accuracy, but not always, as this example demonstrates.

Next we consider series with both positive and negative terms, but in a regular pattern: they alternate, as
in the alternating harmonic series:
∞

1 1 1 1
(−1)n−1 1 −1 1 −1
∑ n = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +··· = 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 +··· .
n=1
In this example the magnitude of the terms decrease, that is, |an | forms a decreasing sequence, although
this is not required in an alternating series. Recall that for a series with positive terms, if the limit of the
terms is not zero, the series cannot converge; but even if the limit of the terms is zero, the series still may
not converge. It turns out that for alternating series, the series converges exactly when the limit of the
terms is zero. In Figure 9.4, we illustrate what happens to the partial sums of the alternating harmonic
series. Because the sizes of the terms an are decreasing, the odd partial sums s1 , s3 , s5 , and so on, form
a decreasing sequence that is bounded below by s2 , so this sequence must converge. Likewise, the even
partial sums s2 , s4 , s6 , and so on, form an increasing sequence that is bounded above by s1 , so this sequence
also converges. Since all the even numbered partial sums are less than all the odd numbered ones, and
since the “jumps” (that is, the ai terms) are getting smaller and smaller, the two sequences must converge
to the same value, meaning the entire sequence of partial sums s1 , s2 , s3 , . . . converges as well.

The same argument works for any alternating sequence with terms that decrease in absolute value. The
alternating series test is worth calling a theorem.
Theorem 9.32: Alternating Series Test

Suppose that {an }∞
n=1 is a non-increasing sequence of positive numbers and lim an = 0. Then the
∞

alternating series

∑ (−1)n−1an converges.

n=1

n→∞

9.4. Alternating Series

Proof. The odd-numbered partial sums, s1 , s3 , s5 , . . . , s2k+1 , . . ., form a non-increasing sequence, because
s2k+3 = s2k+1 − a2k+2 + a2k+3 ≤ s2k+1 , since a2k+2 ≥ a2k+3 . This sequence is bounded below by s2 , so
it must converge, to some value L. Likewise, the partial sums s2 , s4 , s6 , . . . , s2k , . . ., form a non-decreasing
sequence that is bounded above by s1 , so this sequence also converges, to some value M. Since lim an = 0
n→∞
and s2k+1 = s2k + a2k+1 ,
L = lim s2k+1 = lim (s2k + a2k+1 ) = lim s2k + lim a2k+1 = M + 0 = M,
k→∞

k→∞

k→∞

k→∞

so L = M; the two sequences of partial sums converge to the same limit, and this means the entire sequence
of partial sums also converges to L.
♣
Another useful fact is implicit in this discussion. Suppose that
∞

∑ (−1)n−1an

L=

n=1

and that we approximate L by a finite part of this sum, say
N

L≈

∑ (−1)n−1 an.

n=1

Because the terms are decreasing in size, we know that the true value of L must be between this approximation and the next one, that is, between
N

∑ (−1)n−1 an

n=1

N+1

and

∑ (−1)n−1an .

n=1

Depending on whether N is odd or even, the second will be larger or smaller than the first.
Example 9.33:

Approximate the sum of the alternating harmonic series to within 0.05.
Solution. We need to go to the point at which the next term to be added or subtracted is 1/10. Adding up
the first nine and the first ten terms we get approximately 0.746 and 0.646. These are 1/10 apart, so the
value halfway between them, 0.696, is within 0.05 of the correct value.
♣
We have considered alternating series with first index 1, and in which the first term is positive, but a

little thought shows this is not crucial. The same test applies to any similar series, such as

9.5 Comparison Tests
As we begin to compile a list of convergent and divergent series, new ones can sometimes be analyzed by
comparing them to ones that we already understand.
Example 9.34:
∞

Does

1

∑ n2 ln n converge?

n=2

Solution. The obvious first approach, based on what we know, is the integral test. Unfortunately, we
can’t compute the required antiderivative. But looking at the series, it would appear that it must converge,
because the terms we are adding are smaller than the terms of a p-series, that is,
1
n2 ln n

<

1
,
n2

when n ≥ 3. Since adding up the terms 1/n2 doesn’t get “too big”, the new series “should” also converge.
Let’s make this more precise.
∞
∞
1
1
The series ∑ 2
converges if and only if ∑ 2
converges—all we’ve done is dropped the
n=3 n ln n
n=2 n ln n

n=3 n
sn =

n

Since the p-series converges, say to L, and since the terms are positive, tn < L. Since the terms of the new
series are positive, the sn form an increasing sequence and sn < tn < L for all n. Hence the sequence {sn }
is bounded and so converges.
♣

9.5. Comparison Tests

359

Sometimes, even when the integral test applies, comparison to a known series is easier, so it’s generally
a good idea to think about doing a comparison before doing the integral test.
Example 9.35:
∞

Does

| sin n|
converge?
2
n=2 n

∑

Solution. We can’t apply the integral test here, because the terms of this series are not decreasing. Just as
in the previous example, however,
| sin n|
1
≤ 2,
2
n
n
because | sin n| ≤ 1. Once again the partial sums are non-decreasing and bounded above by ∑ 1/n2 = L,
♣
so the new series converges.
Like the integral test, the comparison test can be used to show both convergence and divergence. In
the case of the integral test, a single calculation will confirm whichever is the case. To use the comparison
test we must first have a good idea as to convergence or divergence and pick the sequence for comparison
accordingly.
Example 9.36:
∞

Does

1

∑ √n2 − 3 converge?

n=2

2
Solution. We observe that the −3 should have little
√ effect compared to the n inside the square root, and
therefore guess that the terms are enough like 1/ n2 = 1/n that the series should diverge. We attempt to
show this by comparison to the harmonic series. We note that

√
so that

n2 − 3 2 3
where tn is 1 less than the corresponding partial sum of the harmonic series (because we start at n = 2
instead of n = 1). Since lim tn = ∞, lim sn = ∞ as well.
♣
sn = √

n→∞

n→∞

So the general approach is this: If you believe that a new series is convergent, attempt to find a convergent series whose terms are larger than the terms of the new series; if you believe that a new series is
divergent, attempt to find a divergent series whose terms are smaller than the terms of the new series.
Example 9.37:
∞

Does

1

∑ √n2 + 3 converge?

n=1

360

Sequences and Series

Solution. Just as in the last example, we guess that this is very much like the harmonic series and so
diverges. Unfortunately,

so if ∑ 1/(2n) diverges then the given series diverges. But since ∑ 1/(2n) = (1/2) ∑ 1/n, Theorem 9.20
implies that it does indeed diverge.

9.6 Absolute Convergence
Roughly speaking there are two ways for a series to converge: As in the case of ∑ 1/n2 , the individual terms
get small very quickly, so that the sum of all of them stays finite, or, as in the case of ∑(−1)n−1 /n, the
terms don’t get small fast enough (∑ 1/n diverges), but a mixture of positive and negative terms provides
enough cancellation to keep the sum finite. You might guess from what we’ve seen that if the terms
get small fast enough that the sum of their absolute values converges, then the series will still converge
regardless of which terms are actually positive or negative.
Theorem 9.39: Absolute Convergence
∞

If

∞

∑ |an| converges, then

n=0

∑ an converges.

Proof. Note that 0 ≤ an + |an | ≤ 2|an | so by the comparison test

converges by Theorem 9.20.

So given a series ∑ an with both positive and negative terms, you should first ask whether ∑ |an | converges. This may be an easier question to answer, because we have tests that apply specifically to terms
with non-negative terms. If ∑ |an | converges then you know that ∑ an converges as well. If ∑ |an | diverges
then it still may be true that ∑ an converges, but you will need to use other techniques to decide. Intuitively
this results says that it is (potentially) easier for ∑ an to converge than for ∑ |an | to converge, because terms
may partially cancel in the first series.
If ∑ |an | converges we say that ∑ an converges absolutely; to say that ∑ an converges absolutely is to
say that the terms of the series get small (in absolute value) quickly enough to guarantee that the series
converges, regardless of whether any of the terms cancel each other. If ∑ an converges but ∑ |an | does

not, we say that ∑ an converges conditionally. For example ∑ (−1)n−1 2 converges absolutely, while

then f ′ (x) = −(6x2 + 16x − 3)/(2x2 + 3x + 5)2 , and it is not hard to see that this is negative for x ≥ 1, so

the series is decreasing and by the alternating series test it converges.

∑ n converge? It is possible, but a bit unpleasant, to approach this with the integral test

Does the series

9.7. The Ratio and Root Tests

363

The denominator goes up by a factor of 5, 5n+1 = 5 · 5n , but the numerator goes up by much less:
(n + 1)5 = n5 + 5n4 + 10n3 + 10n2 + 5n + 1, which is much less than 5n5 when n is large, because 5n4 is
much less than n5 . So we might guess that in the long run it begins to look as if each term is 1/5 of the
previous term. We have seen series that behave like this: The geometric series.
∞

∑ 5n = 4 ,

So we might try comparing the given series to some variation of this geometric series. This is possible,
but a bit messy. We can in effect do the same thing, but bypass most of the unpleasant work.

So aN+1 < aN /2, aN+2 < aN+1 /2 < aN /4, aN+3 < aN+2 /2 < aN /8, and so on. The general form is
aN+k < aN /2k . So if we look at the series

Under what circumstances could we do this? What was crucial was that the limit of an+1 /an , say L,
was less than 1 so that we could pick a value r so that L < r < 1. The fact that L < r (1/5 < 1/2 in our
example) means that we can compare the series ∑ an to ∑ rn , and the fact that r < 1 guarantees that ∑ rn
converges. That’s really all that is required to make the argument work. We also made use of the fact that
the terms of the series were positive; in general we simply consider the absolute values of the terms and
we end up testing for absolute convergence.

Theorem 9.42: The Ratio Test

Suppose that lim |an+1 /an | = L. If L < 1 the series ∑ an converges absolutely, if L > 1 the series
n→∞
diverges, and if L = 1 this test gives no information.
Proof. The example above essentially proves the first part of this, if we simply replace 1/5 by L and 1/2
by r. Suppose that L > 1, and pick r so that 1 < r < L. Then for n ≥ N, for some N,
|an+1 |
>r
|an |

and

|an+1 | > r|an |.

This implies that |aN+k | > rk |aN |, but since r > 1 this means that lim |aN+k | =
6 0, which means also

that lim an 6= 0. By the divergence test, the series diverges.

k→∞

n→∞

To see that we get no information when L = 1, we need to exhibit two series with L = 1, one that
converges and one that diverges. The series ∑ 1/n2 and ∑ 1/n provide a simple example.

Recall that the sum of a geometric series can be expressed using the simple formula:
∞

k

∑ kxn = 1 − x ,

n=0

if |x| < 1, and that the series diverges when |x| ≥ 1. At the time, we thought of x as an unspecified constant,
but we could just as well think of it as a variable, in which case the series
∞

∑ kxn

n=0

is a function, namely, the function k/(1 − x), as long as |x| < 1: Looking at this from the opposite perspective, this means that the function k/(1 − x) can be represented as the sum of an infinite series. Why

366

Sequences and Series

would this be useful? While k/(1 − x) is a reasonably easy function to deal with, the more complicated
representation ∑ kxn does have some advantages: it appears to be an infinite version of one of the simplest
function types—a polynomial. Later on we will investigate some of the ways we can take advantage of
this ‘infinite polynomial’ representation, but first we should ask if other functions can even be represented
this way.
The geometric series has a special feature that makes it unlike a typical polynomial—the coefficients
of the powers of x are all the same, namely k. We will need to allow more general coefficients if we are to
get anything other than the geometric series.
Definition 9.46: Power Series

A power series is a series of the form

∞

∑ anxn ,

n=0

where each an is a real number.
As we did in the section on sequences, we can think of the an as being a function a(n) defined on the
non-negative integers. Note, however, that the an do not depend on x.
Example 9.47:
∞

xn
Determine whether the power series ∑
converges.
n=1 n
Solution. We can investigate convergence using the ratio test:
|x|n+1 n
n
=
lim
|x|
= |x|.
n→∞ n + 1 |x|n
n→∞
n+1
lim

Thus when |x| < 1 the series converges and when |x| > 1 it diverges, leaving only two values in doubt.
When x = 1 the series is the harmonic series and diverges; when x = −1 it is the alternating harmonic
series (actually the negative of the usual alternating harmonic series) and converges. Thus, we may think
∞ n
x
as a function from the interval [−1, 1) to the real numbers.
♣
of ∑
n=1 n
A bit of thought reveals that the ratio test applied to a power series will always have the same nice
form. In general, we will compute

n→∞
n→∞ |an |

|an |

assuming that lim |an+1 |/|an| exists. Then the series converges if L|x| < 1, that is, if |x| < 1/L, and
diverges if |x| > 1/L. Only the two values x = ±1/L require further investigation. Thus the series will
always define a function on the interval (−1/L, 1/L), that perhaps will extend to one or both endpoints as
well. Two special cases deserve mention: if L = 0 the limit is 0 no matter what value x takes, so the series
converges for all x and the function is defined for all real numbers. If L = ∞, then no matter what value x

9.8. Power Series

367

takes the limit is infinite and the series converges only when x = 0. The value 1/L is called the radius of
convergence of the series, and the interval on which the series converges is the interval of convergence.
We can make these ideas a bit more general. Consider the series
∞

(x + 2)n
3n
n=0

∑

This looks a lot like a power series, but with (x + 2)n instead of xn . Let’s try to determine the values of x
for which it converges. This is just a geometric series, so it converges when
|x + 2|/3 < 1
|x + 2| < 3
−3 < x + 2 < 3
−5 < x < 1.
So the interval of convergence for this series is (−5, 1). The center of this interval is at −2, which is at
distance 3 from the endpoints, so the radius of convergence is 3, and we say that the series is centered at
−2.
Interestingly, if we compute the sum of the series we get

9.9 Calculus with Power Series
We now know that some functions can be expressed as power series, which look like infinite polynomials.
Since it is easy to find derivatives and integrals of polynomials, we might hope that we can take derivatives
and integrals of power series in an analogous way. In fact we can, as stated in the following theorem, which
we will not prove here.
Theorem 9.49:

when |x| < 1. The series does not converge when x = 1 but does converge when x = −1 or 1 − x = 2. The
interval of convergence is [−1, 1), or 0 < 1 − x ≤ 2. We can use this series to express ln(a) as a series
when 0 < a ≤ 2 by setting x − 1 = a. For example

909/2240 and 909/2240 − 1/2048 = 29053/71680 ≈ .4053, so 0.4053 ≤ ln(3/2) ≤ 0.406.
♣
With a bit of arithmetic, we can approximate values outside of the interval of convergence:
Example 9.51:

Find an approximation for ln(9/4).
Solution. We can use the approximation we just computed, plus some rules for logarithms:
ln(9/4) = ln((3/2)2) = 2 ln(3/2) ≈ 0.812,
and using our bounds above,
0.8106 ≤ ln(9/4) ≤ 0.812.

9.10 Taylor Series
We have seen that some functions can be represented as series, which may give valuable information
about the function. So far, we have seen only those examples that result from manipulation of our one
fundamental example, the geometric series. We would like to start with a given function and produce a
series to represent it, if possible.
∞

Suppose that f (x) =

∑ an xn on some interval of convergence centered at 0.

Then we know that we

n=0

can compute derivatives of f by taking derivatives of the terms of the series. Let’s look at the first few in
general:
f ′ (x) =
f ′′ (x) =
f ′′′ (x) =

n=2
∞

∑ n(n − 1)(n − 2)anxn−3 = 3 · 2a3 + 4 · 3 · 2a4x + · · ·

n=3

By examining these it’s not hard to discern the general pattern. The kth derivative must be
f (k) (x) =

∞

∑ n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · ·(n − k + 1)anxn−k

n=k

= k(k − 1)(k − 2) · · ·(2)(1)ak + (k + 1)(k) · · ·(2)ak+1 x +
+ (k + 2)(k + 1) · · ·(3)ak+2 x2 + · · ·

We can express this more clearly by using factorial notation:
f (k) (x) =

∞

n!

∑ (n − k)! anxn−k = k!ak + (k + 1)!ak+1x +

n=k

(k + 2)!

Note that the original series for f yields f (0) = a0 .
So if a function f can be represented by a series, we can easily find such a series. Given a function f ,
the series

f (n) (0) n
∑ n! x

is called the Maclaurin series for f .
Example 9.52: Maclaurin Series

Find the Maclaurin series for f (x) = 1/(1 − x).
Solution. We need to compute the derivatives of f (and hope to spot a pattern).
f (x) = (1 − x)−1

f ′ (x) = (1 − x)−2

f ′′ (x) = 2(1 − x)−3

f ′′′ (x) = 6(1 − x)−4

f (4) (x) = 4!(1 − x)−5

.
f (n) (x) = n!(1 − x)−n−1

♣

A warning is in order here. Given a function f we may be able to compute the Maclaurin series,
but that does not mean we have found a series representation for f . We still need to know where the
series converges, and if, where it converges, it converges to f (x). While for most commonly encountered
functions the Maclaurin series does indeed converge to f on some interval, this is not true of all functions,
so care is required.
As a practical matter, if we are interested in using a series to approximate a function, we will need
some finite number of terms of the series. Even for functions with messy derivatives we can compute
these using computer software like Sage. If we want to describe a series completely, we would like to
be able to write down a formula for a typical term in the series. Fortunately, a few of the most important
functions are very easy.

Example 9.53: Maclaurin Series

Find the Maclaurin series for sin x.
Solution. Computing the first few derivatives is simple: f ′ (x) = cos x, f ′′ (x) = − sin x, f ′′′ (x) = − cos x,
f (4) (x) = sin x, and then the pattern repeats. The values of the derivative when x = 0 are: 1, 0, −1, 0, 1, 0,
−1, 0,. . . , and so the Maclaurin series is

n→∞ (2n + 3)! |x|2n+1
n→∞ (2n + 3)(2n + 2)

so the series converges for every x. Since it turns out that this series does indeed converge to sin x everywhere, we have a series representation for sin x for every x.
♣
Sometimes the formula for the nth derivative of a function f is difficult to discover, but a combination
of a known Maclaurin series and some algebraic manipulation leads easily to the Maclaurin series for f .
Example 9.54: Maclaurin Series

Find the Maclaurin series for x sin(−x).
Solution. To get from sin x to x sin(−x) we substitute −x for x and then multiply by x. We can do the same

♣
As we have seen, a power series can be centered at a point other than zero, and the method that
produces the Maclaurin series can also produce such series.
Example 9.55: Taylor Series

Find a series centered at −2 for 1/(1 − x).

Sequences and Series

9.11 Taylor’s Theorem
One of the most important uses of infinite series is using an initial portion of the series for f to approximate
f . We have seen, for example, that when we add up the first n terms of an alternating series with decreasing
terms that the difference between this and the true value is at most the size of the next term. A similar
result is true of many Taylor series.
Theorem 9.56:

Suppose that f is defined on some open interval I around a and suppose f (N+1) (x) exists on this
interval. Then for each x 6= a in I there is a value z between x and a so that
N

f (x) =

∑

n=0

f (N+1) (z)
f (n) (a)
(x − a)n +
(x − a)N+1 .
n!
(N + 1)!

Proof. The proof requires some cleverness to set up, but then the details are quite elementary. We define a
function F(t) as follows:
N
f (n) (t)
F(t) = ∑
(x − t)n + B(x − t)N+1 .
n!
n=0
Here we have replaced a by t in the first N +1 terms of the Taylor series, and added a carefully chosen term
on the end, with B to be determined. Note that we are temporarily keeping x fixed, so the only variable in
this equation is t, and we will be interested only in t between a and x. Now substitute t = a:
N

F(a) =

∑

n=0

f (n) (a)
(x − a)n + B(x − a)N+1 .
n!

Set this equal to f (x):
N

f (x) =

∑

n=0

f (n) (a)
(x − a)n + B(x − a)N+1 .
n!

Since x 6= a, we can solve this for B, which is a “constant”—it depends on x and a but those are temporarily
fixed. Now we have defined a function F(t) with the property that F(a) = f (x). Also, all terms with
a positive power of (x − t) become zero when we substitute x for t, so F(x) = f (0) (x)/0! = f (x). So
F(a) = F(x). By Rolle’s theorem (5.21), we know that there is a value z ∈ (a, x) such that F ′ (z) = 0. But
what is F ′ ? Each term in F(t), except the first term and the extra term involving B, is a product, so to take
the derivative we use the product rule on each of these terms.

as desired. Essentially the same argument works for cos x and ex ; unfortunately, it is more difficult to show

Note that our approximation requires that we already have a very accurate approximation of the value

a = 0).

Note well that in these examples we found polynomials of a certain accuracy only on a small interval,
even though the series for sin x and ex converge for all x; this is typical. To get the same accuracy on a
larger interval would require more terms.

10. Differential Equations
Many physical phenomena can be modeled using the language of calculus. For example, observational
evidence suggests that the temperature of a cup of tea (or some other liquid) in a room of constant temperature will cool over time at a rate proportional to the difference between the room temperature and the
temperature of the tea.
In symbols, if t is the time, M is the room temperature, and f (t) is the temperature of the tea at time t
then f ′ (t) = k(M − f (t)) where k > 0 is a constant which will depend on the kind of tea (or more generally
the kind of liquid) but not on the room temperature or the temperature of the tea. This is Newton’s law
of cooling and the equation that we just wrote down is an example of a differential equation. Ideally
we would like to solve this equation, namely, find the function f (t) that describes the temperature over
time, though this often turns out to be impossible, in which case various approximation techniques must
be used. The use and solution of differential equations is an important field of mathematics; here we see
how to solve some simple but useful types of differential equation.
Informally, a differential equation is an equation in which one or more of the derivatives of some function appears. Typically, a scientific theory will produce a differential equation (or a system of differential
equations) that describes or governs some physical process, but the theory will not produce the desired
function or functions directly.

10.1 First Order Differential Equations
We start by considering equations in which only the first derivative of the function appears.
Definition 10.1: First Order Differential Equation

A first order differential equation is an equation of the form F(t, y, y′ ) = 0. A solution of a first
order differential equation is a function f (t) that makes F(t, f (t), f ′(t)) = 0 for every value of t .
Here, F is a function of three variables which we label t, y, and y′ . It is understood that y′ will explicitly
appear in the equation although t and y need not. The term “first order” means that the first derivative of y
appears, but no higher order derivatives do.
Example 10.2: Newton’s Law of Cooling

The equation from Newton’s law of cooling, y′ = k(M − y) is a first order differential equation;
F(t, y, y′ ) = k(M − y) − y′ .

379

380

Differential Equations

Example 10.3: A First Order Differential Equation
y′ = t 2 + 1 is a first order differential equation; F(t, y, y′) = y′ −t 2 − 1. All solutions to this equation
are of the form t 3/3 + t +C.

Definition 10.4: First Order Initial Value Problem

A first order initial value problem is a system of equations of the form F(t, y, y′) = 0, y(t0 ) = y0 .
Here t0 is a fixed time and y0 is a number. A solution of an initial value problem is a solution f (t)
of the differential equation that also satisfies the initial condition f (t0 ) = y0 .

Example 10.5: An Initial Value Problem

Verify that the initial value problem y′ = t 2 + 1, y(1) = 4 has solution f (t) = t 3/3 + t + 8/3.
Solution. Observe that f ′ (t) = t 2 + 1 and f (1) = 13 /2 + 1 + 8/3 = 4 as required.

♣

The general first order equation is too general, so we can’t describe methods that will work on them
all, or even a large portion of them. We can make progress with specific kinds of first order differential
equations. For example, much can be said about equations of the form y′ = φ (t, y) where φ is a function
of the two variables t and y. Under reasonable conditions on φ , such an equation has a solution and the
corresponding initial value problem has a unique solution. However, in general, these equations can be
very difficult or impossible to solve explicitly.
Example 10.6: IVP for Newton’s Law of Cooling

Consider this specific example of an initial value problem for Newton’s law of cooling: y′ = 2(25 −
y), y(0) = 40. Discuss the solutions for this initial value problem.
Solution. We first note the zero of the equation: If y(t0) = 25, the right hand side of the differential
equation is zero, and so the constant function y(t) = 25 is a solution to the differential equation. It is
not a solution to the initial value problem, since y(0) 6= 25. (The physical interpretation of this constant
solution is that if a liquid is at the same temperature as its surroundings, then the liquid will stay at that
temperature.) So long as y is not 25, we can rewrite the differential equation as
dy 1
= 2
dt 25 − y
1
dy = 2 dt,
25 − y

so

1
dy = 2 dt,
25 − y
that is, the two anti-derivatives must be the same except for a constant difference. We can calculate these
anti-derivatives and rearrange the results:

25 ± eC e−2t = 25 + Ae−2t .

Here A = ± eC = ± e−C0 is some non-zero constant. Since we want y(0) = 40, we substitute and solve for
A:
40 = 25 + Ae0
15 = A,
and so y = 25 +15e−2t is a solution to the initial value problem. Note that y is never 25, so this makes sense
for all values of t. However, if we allow A = 0 we get the solution y = 25 to the differential equation, which
would be the solution to the initial value problem if we were to require y(0) = 25. Thus, y = 25 + Ae−2t
describes all solutions to the differential equation y′ = 2(25 − y), and all solutions to the associated initial
♣
value problems.
Why could we solve this problem? Our solution depended on rewriting the equation so that all instances of y were on one side of the equation and all instances of t were on the other. Of course, in this
case the only t was originally hidden, since we didn’t write dy/dt in the original equation. This is not
required, however.
Example 10.7: Solving an IVP

Solve the differential equation y′ = 2t(25 − y).

Definition 10.8: Separable Differential Equations

A first order differential equation is separable if it can be written in the form
y′ = f (t)g(y).

Differential Equations

As in the examples, we can attempt to solve a separable equation by converting to the form
1
dy =
g(y)

Z

Z

f (t) dt.

This technique is called separation of variables. The simplest (in principle) sort of separable equation is
one in which g(y) = 1, in which case we attempt to solve
Z

1 dy =

Z

f (t) dt.

We can do this if we can find an anti-derivative of f (t).
As we have seen so far, a differential equation typically has an infinite number of solutions. Such
a solution is called a general solution. A corresponding initial value problem will give rise to just one
solution. Such a solution in which there are no unknown constants remaining is called a particular
solution.
The general approach to separable equations is as follows: Suppose we wish to solve y′ = f (t)g(y)
where f and g are continuous functions. If g(a) = 0 for some a then y(t) = a is a constant solution of the
equation, since in this case y′ = 0 = f (t)g(a). For example, y′ = y2 − 1 has constant solutions y(t) = 1 and
y(t) = −1.
To find the nonconstant solutions, we note that the function 1/g(y) is continuous where g 6= 0, so 1/g
has an antiderivative G. Let F be an antiderivative of f . Now we write
G(y) =

Z

1
dy =
g(y)

Z

f (t) dt = F(t) +C,

so G(y) = F(t) +C. Now we solve this equation for y.
Of course, there are a few places this ideal description could go wrong: We need to be able to find the
antiderivatives G and F, and we need to solve the final equation for y. The upshot is that the solutions to
the original differential equation are the constant solutions, if any, and all functions y that satisfy G(y) =
F(t) +C.
Example 10.9: Population Growth and Radioactive Decay

Analyze the differential equation y′ = ky.
Solution. When k > 0, this describes certain simple cases of population growth: It says that the change
in the population y is proportional to the population. The underlying assumption is that each organism in
the current population reproduces at a fixed rate, so the larger the population the more new organisms are
produced. While this is too simple to model most real populations, it is useful in some cases over a limited
time. When k < 0, the differential equation describes a quantity that decreases in proportion to the current
value; this can be used to model radioactive decay.
The constant solution is y(t) = 0; of course this will not be the solution to any interesting initial value
problem. For the non-constant solutions, we proceed much as before:

Again, if we allow A = 0 this includes the constant solution, and we can simply say that y = Aekt is the
general solution. With an initial value we can easily solve for A to get the solution of the initial value
problem. In particular, if the initial value is given for time t = 0, y(0) = y0 , then A = y0 and the solution is

10.2 First Order Homogeneous Linear Equations
A simple, but important and useful, type of separable equation is the first order homogeneous linear
equation:
Definition 10.10: First Order Homogeneous Linear Equation

A first order homogeneous linear differential equation is one of the form y′ + p(t)y = 0 or equivalently y′ = −p(t)y.
“Homogeneous” refers to the zero on the right side of the equation, provided that y′ and y are on the
left. “Linear” in this definition indicates that both y′ and y appear independently and explicitly; we don’t
see y′ or y to any power greater than 1, or multiplied by each other (i.e. y′ y).

10.2. First Order Homogeneous Linear Equations

Example 10.11: Linear Examples

The equation y′ = 2t(25 − y) can be written y′ + 2ty = 50t . This is linear, but not homogeneous. The
equation y′ = ky, or y′ − ky = 0 is linear and homogeneous, with a particularly simple p(t) = −k.
The equation y′ + y2 = 0 is homogeneous, but not linear.

where P(t) is an anti-derivative of −p(t). As in previous examples, if we allow A = 0 we get the constant
solution y = 0.

10.3 First Order Linear Equations
As you might guess, a first order linear differential equation has the form y′ + p(t)y = f (t). Not only is this
closely related in form to the first order homogeneous linear equation, we can use what we know about
solving homogeneous equations to solve the general linear equation.
Suppose that y1 (t) and y2 (t) are solutions to y′ + p(t)y = f (t). Let g(t) = y1 − y2 . Then
g′ (t) + p(t)g(t) = y′1 − y′2 + p(t)(y1 − y2 )
= (y′1 + p(t)y1 ) − (y′2 + p(t)y2)
= f (t) − f (t) = 0.

In other words, g(t) = y1 − y2 is a solution to the homogeneous equation y′ + p(t)y = 0. Turning this
around, any solution to the linear equation y′ + p(t)y = f (t), call it y1 , can be written as y2 + g(t), for
some particular y2 and some solution g(t) of the homogeneous equation y′ + p(t)y = 0. Since we already
know how to find all solutions of the homogeneous equation, finding just one solution to the equation
y′ + p(t)y = f (t) will give us all of them.
How might we find that one particular solution to y′ + p(t)y = f (t)? Again, it turns out that what we
already know helps. We know that the general solution to the homogeneous equation y′ + p(t)y = 0 looks
like AeP(t) . We now make an inspired guess: Consider the function v(t)eP(t), in which we have replaced
the constant parameter A with the function v(t). This technique is called variation of parameters. For
convenience write this as s(t) = v(t)h(t), where h(t) = eP(t) is a solution to the homogeneous equation.
Now let’s compute a bit with s(t):
s′ (t) + p(t)s(t) = v(t)h′(t) + v′(t)h(t) + p(t)v(t)h(t)
= v(t)(h′(t) + p(t)h(t)) + v′(t)h(t)
= v′ (t)h(t).
The last equality is true because h′ (t) + p(t)h(t) = 0. Since h(t) is a solution to the homogeneous equation.
We are hoping to find a function s(t) so that s′ (t) + p(t)s(t) = f (t); we will have such a function if we
can arrange to have v′ (t)h(t) = f (t), that is, v′ (t) = f (t)/h(t). But this is as easy (or hard) as finding an
anti-derivative of f (t)/h(t). Putting this all together, the general solution to y′ + p(t)y = f (t) is
v(t)h(t) + AeP(t) = v(t)eP(t) + AeP(t) .
Example 10.14: Solving an IVP

Find the solution of the initial value problem y′ + 3y/t = t 2, y(1) = 1/2.
Solution. First we find the general solution; since we are interested in a solution with a given condition at
t = 1, we may assume t > 0. We start by solving the homogeneous equation as usual; call the solution g:
g = Ae−

R

(3/t) dt

= Ae−3 lnt = At −3.

Then as in the discussion, h(t) = t −3 and v′ (t) = t 2/t −3 = t 5, so v(t) = t 6/6. We know that every solution
to the equation looks like
t6
t3
v(t)t −3 + At −3 = t −3 + At −3 = + At −3.

Another common method for solving such a differential equation is by means of an integrating factor.
In the differential equation y′ + p(t)y = f (t), we note that if we multiply through by a function I(t) to get
I(t)y′ + I(t)p(t)y = I(t) f (t), the left hand side looks like it could be a derivative computed by the product
rule:
d
(I(t)y) = I(t)y′ + I ′ (t)y.
dt
Now if we could choose I(t) so that I ′ (t) = I(t)p(t), this would be exactly the left hand side of the
differential equation. But this is
Z just a first order homogeneous linear equation, and we know a solution
is I(t) = eQ(t) , where Q(t) =

p dt; note that Q(t) = −P(t), where P(t) appears in the variation of

parameters method and P′ (t) = −p. Now the modified differential equation is
e−P(t) y′ + e−P(t) p(t)y = e−P(t) f (t)
d −P(t)
(e
y) = e−P(t) f (t).

Integrating both sides gives

If you look carefully, you will see that this is exactly the same solution we found by variation of parameters,
because e−P(t) f (t) = f (t)/h(t).
Some people find it easier to remember how to use the integrating factor method, rather than variation
of parameters. Since ultimately they require the same calculation, you should use whichever of the two
methods appeals to you more strongly. Using this method, the solution of the previous example
would look

just a bit different: Starting with y + 3y/t = t , we recall that the integrating factor is e

10.4 Approximation
We have seen how to solve a restricted collection of differential equations, or more accurately, how to
attempt to solve them—we still may not be able to find the required anti-derivatives. Not surprisingly,
non-linear equations can be even more difficult to solve. Yet much is known about solutions to some more
general equations.
Suppose φ (t, y) is a function of two variables. A more general class of first order differential equations
has the form y′ = φ (t, y). This is not necessarily a linear first order equation, since φ may depend on y
in some complicated way; note however that y′ appears in a very simple form. Under suitable conditions
on the function φ , it can be shown that every such differential equation has a solution, and moreover
that for each initial condition the associated initial value problem has exactly one solution. In practical
applications this is obviously a very desirable property.
Example 10.15: First Order Non-linear

The equation y′ = t − y2 is a first order non-linear equation, because y appears to the second power.
We will not be able to solve this equation.

390

Differential Equations

Example 10.16: Non-linear and Separable

The equation y′ = y2 is also non-linear, but it is separable and can be solved by separation of
variables.
Not all differential equations that are important in practice can be solved exactly, so techniques have
been developed to approximate solutions. We describe one such technique, Euler’s Method, which is
simple though not particularly useful compared to some more sophisticated techniques.
Suppose we wish to approximate a solution to the initial value problem y′ = φ (t, y), y(t0) = y0 , for
t ≥ t0 . Under reasonable conditions on φ , we know the solution exists, represented by a curve in the t-y
plane; call this solution f (t). The point (t0 , y0 ) is of course on this curve. We also know the slope of the
curve at this point, namely φ (t0 , y0 ). If we follow the tangent line for a brief distance, we arrive at a point
that should be almost on the graph of f (t), namely (t0 +∆t, y0 + φ (t0, y0 )∆t); call this point (t1, y1 ). Now we
pretend, in effect, that this point really is on the graph of f (t), in which case we again know the slope of the
curve through (t1, y1 ), namely φ (t1 , y1 ). So we can compute a new point, (t2 , y2 ) = (t1 +∆t, y1 + φ (t1 , y1 )∆t)
that is a little farther along, still close to the graph of f (t) but probably not quite so close as (t1 , y1 ). We
can continue in this way, doing a sequence of straightforward calculations, until we have an approximation
(tn, yn ) for whatever time tn we need. At each step we do essentially the same calculation, namely:
(ti+1, yi+1 ) = (ti + ∆t, yi + φ (ti , yi )∆t).
We expect that smaller time steps ∆t will give better approximations, but of course it will require more
work to compute to a specified time. It is possible to compute a guaranteed upper bound on how far off the
approximation might be, that is, how far yn is from f (tn ). Suffice it to say that the bound is not particularly
good and that there are other more complicated approximation techniques that do better.
Example 10.17: Approximating a Solution

Compute an approximation to the solution for y′ = t − y2 , y(0) = 0, when t = 1.
Solution. We will use ∆t = 0.2, which is easy to do even by hand, though we should not expect the
resulting approximation to be very good. We get
(t1, y1 )
= (0 + 0.2, 0 + (0 − 02)0.2) = (0.2, 0)
(t2, y2 )
= (0.2 + 0.2, 0 + (0.2 − 02)0.2) = (0.4, 0.04)
(t3, y3 )
= (0.6, 0.04 + (0.4 − 0.042)0.2) = (0.6, 0.11968)
(t4, y4 )
= (0.8, 0.11968 + (0.6 − 0.119682)0.2) = (0.8, 0.23681533952)
(t5, y5 ) = (1.0, 0.23681533952 + (0.6 − 0.236815339522)0.2) = (1.0, 0.385599038513605)
So y(1) ≈ 0.3856. As it turns out, this is not accurate to even one decimal place. Figure 10.1 shows these
points connected by line segments (the lower curve) compared to a solution obtained by a much better
approximation technique. Note that the shape is approximately correct even though the end points are
quite far apart.

If you need to do Euler’s method by hand, it is useful to construct a table to keep track of the work,
as shown in Figure 10.2. Each row holds the computation for a single step: The starting point (ti , yi ); the
stepsize ∆t; the computed slope φ (ti , yi ); the change in y, ∆y = φ (ti , yi )∆t; and the new point, (ti+1, yi+1 ) =
(ti + ∆t, yi + ∆y). The starting point in each row is the newly computed point from the end of the previous
row.

♣
Euler’s method is related to another technique that can help in understanding a differential equation in
a qualitative way. Euler’s method is based on the ability to compute the slope of a solution curve at any
point in the plane, simply by computing φ (t, y). If we compute φ (t, y) at many points, say in a grid, and
plot a small line segment with that slope at the point, we can get an idea of how solution curves must look.
Such a plot is called a slope field. A slope field for φ = t − y2 is shown in Figure 10.3; compare this to
figure 10.1. With a little practice, one can sketch reasonably accurate solution curves based on the slope
field, in essence doing Euler’s method visually.

Differential Equations

Figure 10.3: A slope field for y′ = t − y2 .
Even when a differential equation can be solved explicitly, the slope field can help in understanding
what the solutions look like with various initial conditions. Recall the logistic equation y′ = ky(M − y):
y is a population at time t, M is a measure of how large a population the environment can support, and k
measures the reproduction rate of the population. Figure 10.4 shows a slope field for this equation that is
quite informative. It is apparent that if the initial population is smaller than M it rises to M over the long
term, while if the initial population is greater than M it decreases to M.

Exercises for 10.4
In the following exercises, compute the Euler approximations for the initial value problem for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1
and ∆t = 0.2. If you have access to Sage, generate the slope field first and attempt to sketch the solution
curve. Then use Sage to compute better approximations with smaller values of ∆t.

10.5 Second Order Homogeneous Equations
A second order differential equation is one containing the second derivative y′′ . These are in general
quite complicated, but one fairly simple type is useful: The second order linear equation with constant
coefficients.
Example 10.18: Second Order Homogeneous Equation

Analyze the intial value problem y′′ − y′ − 2y = 0, y(0) = 5, y′ (0) = 0.
Solution. We make an inspired guess: might there be a solution of the form ert ? This seems at least
plausible, since in this case y′′ , y′ , and y all involve ert .
If such a function is a solution then
r2 ert − rert − 2ert

(r2 − r − 2)

so r is 2 or −1. Not only are f = e2t and g = e−t solutions, but notice that y = A f + Bg is also, for any
constants A and B:
(A f + Bg)′′ − (A f + Bg)′ − 2(A f + Bg) = A f ′′ + Bg′′ − A f ′ − Bg′ − 2A f − 2Bg
= A( f ′′ − f ′ − 2 f ) + B(g′′ − g′ − 2g)
= A(0) + B(0) = 0.
Can we find A and B so that this is a solution to the initial value problem? Let’s substitute:
5 = y(0) = A f (0) + Bg(0) = Ae0 + Be0 = A + B
and
0 = y′ (0) = A f ′ (0) + Bg′(0) = A2e0 + B(−1)e0 = 2A − B.

So we need to solve this system of two equations with two unknowns:

A+B = 5
2A − B = 0

Let B = 2A, substitute into the first equation to get 5 = A + 2A = 3A. Then A = 5/3 and B = 10/3, and the
desired solution is (5/3)e2t + (10/3)e−t . You now see why the initial condition in this case included both
y(0) and y′ (0): We needed two equations in the two unknowns A and B
♣

Differential Equations

You should of course wonder whether there might be other solutions, but as it turns out, the answer is
no. We will not prove this, but here is the theorem that tells us what we need to know:
Theorem 10.19: Solutions to Second Order Homogeneous

Given the differential equation ay′′ + by′ + cy = 0, a 6= 0, consider the quadratic polynomial ar2 +
br + c = 0, called the characteristic polynomial. Using the quadratic formula, this polynomial
always has one or two roots, call them r1 and r2 . The general solution of the differential equation
is:
(a) y = Aer1t + Ber2t , if the roots r1 and r2 are real numbers, and r1 6= r2 .
(b) y = Aer1t + Bter2t , if r1 = r2 is a real, repeated root.
(c) y = A cos(β t)eα t + B sin(β t)eα t , if the roots are complex numbers, r = α ± β i.
Example 10.20:

Solve the differential equation y′′ + A2 y = 0.
Solution. First we write the characteristic equation, r2 +A2 = 0. Then we find the roots of the characteristic
equation:
r2 = −A2 =⇒ r = ±Ai
These are imaginary roots, so the solution of the differential equation is in the form:
y = c1 cos(At) + c2 sin(At)
♣
Example 10.21:

Solve the differential equation y′′ − A2 y = 0.
Solution. First we write the characteristic equation, r2 −A2 = 0. Then we find the roots of the characteristic
equation:
r2 = A2 =⇒ r = ±A

These are imaginary roots, so the solution of the differential equation is in the form:
y = c1 eAt + c2 e−At = c1 eAt +

c2
eAt
♣

Example 10.22: Damped Spring Oscillation

Use a differential equation to describe the position of a mass hung on a spring.

10.5. Second Order Homogeneous Equations

395

Solution. Suppose a mass m is hung on a spring with spring constant k. If the spring is compressed or
stretched and then released, the mass will oscillate up and down. Due to friction, the oscillation will
be damped: Eventually the motion will cease. The damping will depend on the amount of friction; for
example, if the system is suspended in oil the motion will cease sooner than if the system is in air. Using
some simple physics, it is not hard to see that the position of the mass is described by the differential
equation: my′′ + by′ + ky = 0. Using m = 1, b = 4, and k = 5√we find the motion of the mass. The
characteristic polynomial is r2 + 4r + 5 = 0, with roots r = (−4 ± 16 − 20)/2 = −2 ± i. Thus the general
solution is y = A cos(t)e−2t + B sin(t)e−2t . Suppose we know that y(0) = 1 and y′ (0) = 2. Then as before
we form two simultaneous equations: From y(0) = 1 we get 1 = A cos(0)e0 + B sin(0)e0 = A. For the
second we compute
y′′ = −2Ae−2t cos(t) + Ae−2t (− sin(t)) − 2Be−2t sin(t) + Be−2t cos(t),
and then
2 = −2Ae0 cos(0) − Ae0 sin(0) − 2Be0 sin(0) + Be0 cos(0) = −2A + B.

So we get A = 1, B = 4, and y = cos(t)e−2t + 4 sin(t)e−2t .
Here is a useful trick that makes this easier to understand: We have y = (cost + 4 sint)e−2t . The
expression cost + 4 sint is a bit reminiscent of the trigonometric formula cos(α − β ) = cos(α ) cos(β ) +
sin(α ) sin(β ) with α = t. Let’s rewrite it a bit as


√
1
4
17 √ cost + √ sint .
17
17
√
√
√
Note that √
(1/ 17)2 + (4/ 17)2 = 1, which means that there is an angle β with cos β = 1/ 17 and
sin β = 4/ 17 (of course, β may not be a “nice” angle). Then
√
√
cost + 4 sint = 17 (cost cos β + sin β sint) = 17 cos(t − β ).
√
Thus, the solution √
may also be written y = 17e−2t cos(t − β ). This is a cosine curve that has been shifted
β to the right; the 17e−2t has the effect of diminishing the amplitude of the cosine as t increases.
♣
Other physical systems that oscillate can also be described by such differential equations. Some electric circuits, for example, generate oscillating current.
Example 10.23:

Find the solution to the intial value problem y′′ − 4y′ + 4y = 0, y(0) = −3, y′ (0) = 1.
Solution. The characteristic polynomial is r2 − 4r + 4 = (r − 2)2 , so there is one root, r = 2, and the
general solution is Ae2t + Bte2t . Substituting t = 0 we get −3 = A + 0 = A. The first derivative is 2Ae2t +
2Bte2t + Be2t ; substituting t = 0 gives 1 = 2A + 0 + B = 2A + B = 2(−3) + B = −6 + B, so B = 7. The
solution is −3e2t + 7te2t .

10.6 Second Order Linear Equations - Method of Undetermined Coefficients
Now we consider second order equations of the form ay′′ + by′ + cy = f (t), with a, b, and c constant. Of
course, if a = 0 this is really a first order equation, so we assume a 6= 0. Also, if c = 0 we can solve the
related first order equation ah′ + bh = f (t), and then solve h = y′ for y. So we will only examine examples
in which c 6= 0.
Suppose that y1 (t) and y2 (t) are solutions to ay′′ +by′ +cy = f (t), and consider the function h = y1 −y2 .
We substitute this function into the left hand side of the differential equation and simplify:
a(y1 − y2 )′′ + b(y1 − y2 )′ + c(y1 − y2 ) = ay′′1 + by′1 + cy1 − (ay′′2 + by′2 + cy2 ) = f (t) − f (t) = 0.
So h is a solution to the homogeneous equation ay′′ + by′ + cy = 0. Since we know how to find all such
h, then with just one particular solution y2 we can express all possible solutions y1 , namely, y1 = h + y2 ,
where now h is the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Of course, this is exactly how we
approached the first order linear equation.
To make use of this observation we need a method to find a single solution y2 . This turns out to
be somewhat more difficult than the first order case, but if f (t) is of a certain simple form, we can find a
solution using the method of undetermined coefficients, sometimes more whimsically called the method
of judicious guessing.
Example 10.24: Second Order Linear Equation

Solve the differential equation y′′ − y′ − 6y = 18t 2 + 5.
Solution. The general solution of the homogeneous equation is Ae3t + Be−2t . We guess that a solution to
the non-homogeneous equation might look like f (t) itself, namely, a quadratic y = at 2 + bt + c. Substituting this guess into the differential equation we get
y′′ − y′ − 6y = 2a − (2at + b) − 6(at 2 + bt + c) = −6at 2 + (−2a − 6b)t + (2a − b − 6c).
We want this to equal 18t 2 + 5, so we need
−6a = 18
−2a − 6b = 0
2a − b − 6c = 5
This is a system of three equations in three unknowns and is not hard to solve: a = −3, b = 1, c = −2.
Thus the general solution to the differential equation is Ae3t + Be−2t − 3t 2 + t − 2.
♣
So the “judicious guess” is a function with the same form as f (t) but with undetermined (or better, yet
to be determined) coefficients. This works whenever f (t) is a polynomial.
Example 10.25: Mass-Spring System with No Damping

Analyze the initial value problem my′′ + ky = −mg, y(0) = 2, y′ (0) = 50.

398

Differential Equations

Solution. The left hand side represents a mass-spring system with no damping, i.e., b = 0. Unlike the
homogeneous case, we now consider the force due to gravity, −mg, assuming the spring is vertical at
the surface of the earth, so that g = 980. To be specific, let us take m = 1 and k = 100. The general
solution to the homogeneous equation is A cos(10t) + B sin(10t). For the solution to the non-homogeneous
equation we guess simply a constant y = a, since −mg = −980 is a constant. Then y′′ + 100y = 100a so
a = −980/100 = −9.8. The desired general solution is then A cos(10t) + B sin(10t) − 9.8. Substituting
the initial conditions we get
2 = A − 9.8
50 = 10B
so A = 11.8 and B = 5 and the solution is 11.8 cos(10t) + 5 sin(10t) − 9.8.

♣

More generally, this method can be used when a function similar to f (t) has derivatives that are also
similar to f (t); in the examples so far, since f (t) was a polynomial, so were its derivatives. The method
will work if f (t) has the form p(t)eα t cos(β t) + q(t)eα t sin(β t), where p(t) and q(t) are polynomials;
when α = β = 0 this is simply p(t), a polynomial. In the most general form it is not simple to describe
the appropriate judicious guess; we content ourselves with some examples to illustrate the process.
Example 10.26: Solving a Second Order Linear Equation

Find the general solution to y′′ + 7y′ + 10y = e3t .
Solution. The characteristic equation is r2 + 7r + 10 = (r + 5)(r + 2), so the solution to the homogeneous equation is Ae−5t + Be−2t . For a particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation we guess Ce3t .
Substituting we get
9Ce3t + 21Ce3t + 10Ce3t = e3t 40C.
When C = 1/40 this is equal to f (t) = e3t , so the solution is Ae−5t + Be−2t + (1/40)e3t .

♣

Example 10.27: Solving a Second Order Linear Equation

Find the general solution to y′′ + 7y′ + 10y = e−2t .
Solution. Following the last example we might guess Ce−2t , but since this is a solution to the homogeneous
equation it cannot work. Instead we guess Cte−2t . Then
(−2Ce−2t − 2Ce−2t + 4Cte−2t ) + 7(Ce−2t − 2Cte−2t ) + 10Cte−2t = e−2t (−3C).
Then C = −1/3 and the solution is Ae−5t + Be−2t − (1/3)te−2t .

♣

In general, if f (t) = ekt and k is one of the roots of the characteristic equation, then we guess Ctekt
instead of Cekt . If k is the only root of the characteristic equation, then Ctekt will also not work, so we
must guess Ct 2ekt .
Example 10.28: Solving a Second Order Linear Equation

Find the general solution to y′′ − 6y′ + 9y = e3t .

10.6. Second Order Linear Equations - Method of Undetermined Coefficients

399

Solution. The characteristic equation is r2 − 6r + 9 = (r − 3)2 , so the general solution to the homogeneous
equation is Ae3t + Bte3t . Guessing Ct 2e3t for the particular solution, we get
(9Ct 2e3t + 6Cte3t + 6Cte3t + 2Ce3t ) − 6(3Ct 2e3t + 2Cte3t ) + 9Ct 2e3t = e3t 2C.
Thus, the solution is Ae3t + Bte3t + (1/2)t 2e3t .

♣

It is common in various physical systems to encounter an f (t) of the form a cos(ω t) + b sin(ω t).
Example 10.29: Solving a Second Order Linear Equation

Find the general solution to y′′ + 6y′ + 25y = cos(4t).
Solution. The roots of the characteristic equation are −3 ±4i, so the solution to the homogeneous equation
is e−3t (A cos(4t) + B sin(4t)). For a particular solution, we guess C cos(4t) + D sin(4t). Substituting as
usual:
(−16C cos(4t) + −16D sin(4t)) + 6(−4C sin(4t) + 4D cos(4t)) + 25(C cos(4t) + D sin(4t))
= (24D + 9C) cos(4t) + (−24C + 9D) sin(4t).
To make this equal to cos(4t) we need
24D + 9C = 1
9D − 24C = 0
which gives C = 1/73 and D = 8/219. The full solution is then e−3t (A cos(4t)+B sin(4t))+(1/73) cos(4t)+
(8/219) sin(4t).
The function e−3t (A cos(4t)+B sin(4t)) is a damped oscillation as in example 10.25, while (1/73) cos(4t)+
(8/219) sin(4t) is a simple undamped oscillation. As t increases, the sum e−3t (A cos(4t) + B sin(4t)) approaches zero, so the solution
e−3t (A cos(4t) + B sin(4t)) + (1/73) cos(4t) + (8/219) sin(4t)
becomes more and more like the simple oscillation (1/73) cos(4t)+(8/219) sin(4t)—notice that the initial
conditions don’t matter to this long term behavior. The damped portion is called the transient [part of the]
solution, and the simple oscillation is called the steady state [part of the] solution. A physical example
is a mass-spring system. If the only force on the mass is due to the spring, then the behavior of the system
is a damped oscillation. If in addition an external force is applied to the mass, and if the force varies
according to a function of the form a cos(ω t) + b sin(ω t), then the long term behavior will be a simple
oscillation determined by the steady state portion of the general solution; the initial position of the mass
will not matter.
♣
As with the exponential form, such a simple guess may not work.
Example 10.30: Solving a Second Order Linear Equation

Find the general solution to y′′ + 16y = − sin(4t).

400

Differential Equations

Solution. The roots of the characteristic equation are ±4i, so the solution to the homogeneous equation is A cos(4t) + B sin(4t). Since both cos(4t) and sin(4t) are solutions to the homogeneous equation,
C cos(4t) + D sin(4t) is also, so it cannot be a solution to the non-homogeneous equation. Instead, we
guess Ct cos(4t) + Dt sin(4t). Then substituting:
(−16Ct cos(4t) − 16D sin(4t) + 8D cos(4t) − 8C sin(4t))) + 16(Ct cos(4t) + Dt sin(4t))
= 8D cos(4t) − 8C sin(4t).
Thus C = 1/8, D = 0, and the solution is C cos(4t) + D sin(4t) + (1/8)t cos(4t).

♣

In general, if f (t) = a cos(ω t) + b sin(ω t), and ±ω i are the roots of the characteristic equation, then
instead of C cos(ω t) + D sin(ω t) we guess Ct cos(ω t) + Dt sin(ω t).

10.7 Second Order Linear Equations Variation of Parameters
The method of the last section works only when the function f (t) in ay′′ +by′ +cy = f (t) has a particularly
nice form, namely, when the derivatives of f look much like f itself. In other cases we can try variation
of parameters as we did in the first order case.
Since as before a 6= 0, we can always divide by a to make the coefficient of y′′ equal to 1. Thus, to
simplify the discussion, we assume a = 1. We know that the differential equation y′′ + by′ + cy = 0 has a
general solution y = Ay1 + By2 . As before, we guess a particular solution to y′′ + by′ + cy = f (t); this time
we use the guess y = u(t)y1 + v(t)y2 . Compute the derivatives:
y′ = u′ y1 + uy′1 + v′ y2 + vy′2
y′′ = u′′ y1 + u′ y′1 + u′ y′1 + uy′′1 + v′′ y2 + v′ y′2 + v′ y′2 + vy′′2 .
Now substituting:
y′′ + by′ + cy = u′′ y1 + u′ y′1 + u′ y′1 + uy′′1 + v′′ y2 + v′ y′2 + v′ y′2 + vy′′2

402

Differential Equations
+bu′ y1 + buy′1 + bv′ y2 + bvy′2 + cuy1 + cvy2
= (uy′′1 + buy′1 + cuy1 ) + (vy′′2 + bvy′2 + cvy2 )
+b(u′ y1 + v′ y2 ) + (u′′y1 + u′ y′1 + v′′ y2 + v′ y′2 ) + (u′ y′1 + v′ y′2 )
= 0 + 0 + b(u′ y1 + v′ y2 ) + (u′′y1 + u′ y′1 + v′′ y2 + v′ y′2 ) + (u′ y′1 + v′ y′2 ).

The first two terms in parentheses are zero because y1 and y2 are solutions to the associated homogeneous
equation. Now we engage in some wishful thinking. If u′ y1 + v′ y2 = 0, then we also have u′′ y1 + u′ y′1 +
v′′ y2 + v′ y′2 = 0 by taking derivatives of both sides. This reduces the entire expression to u′ y′1 + v′ y′2 = 0.
We want this to be f (t), that is, we need u′ y′1 + v′ y′2 = f (t). So we would very much like these equations
to be true:
u′ y1 + v′ y2 = 0
u′ y′1 + v′ y′2 = f (t).
This is a system of two equations in the two unknowns u′ and v′ , so we can solve as usual to get u′ = g(t)
and v′ = h(t). Then we can find u and v by computing antiderivatives. This is of course the sticking point
in the whole plan, since the antiderivatives may be impossible to find. Nevertheless, this sometimes works
out and is worth a try.
Example 10.31: Variation of Parameters

Consider the equation y′′ − 5y′ + 6y = sint . Solve using variation of parameters.
Solution. The solution to the homogeneous equation is Ae2t + Be3t , so the simultaneous equations to be
solved are
u′ e2t + v′ e3t = 0
2u′ e2t + 3v′ e3t = sint.
If we multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation we get
v′ e3t = sint
v′ = e−3t sint
1
v = − (3 sint + cost)e−3t ,

using integration by parts. Then from the first equation:
u′ = −e−2t v′ e3t = −e−2t e−3t sin(t)e3t = −e−2t sint
1
u =
(2 sint + cost)e−2t .

yield the same result.

Example 10.32: Variation of Parameters

The differential equation y′′ − 5y′ + 6y = et sint can be solved using the method of undetermined
coefficients, though we have not seen any examples of such a solution. Again, we will solve it by
variation of parameters.
Solution. The equations to be solved are
u′ e2t + v′ e3t = 0
2u′ e2t + 3v′ e3t = et sint.
If we multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation we get
v′ e3t = et sint
v′ = e−3t et sint = e−2t sint
1
v = − (2 sint + cost)e−2t .

Then substituting we get
u′ = −e−2t v′ e3t = −e−2t e−2t sin(t)e3t = −e−t sint

u =

11. Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations
11.1 Polar Coordinates
Coordinate systems are tools that let us use algebraic methods to understand geometry. While the rectangular (also called Cartesian) coordinates that we have been using are the most common, some problems
are easier to analyze in alternate coordinate systems.
A coordinate system is a scheme that allows us to identify any point in the plane or in three-dimensional
space by a set of numbers. In rectangular coordinates these numbers are interpreted, roughly speaking, as
the lengths of the sides of a rectangle. In polar coordinates a point in the plane is identified by a pair of
numbers (r, θ ). The number θ measures the angle between the positive x-axis and a ray that goes through
the point, as shown in Figure 12.15; the number r measures the distance
√ from the origin to the point (the
radius). Figure 12.15 shows the point with rectangular coordinates (1, 3) and polar coordinates (2, π /3),
2 units from the origin and π /3 radians from the positive x-axis.

Figure 11.1: Polar coordinates of the point (1, 3).
Just as we describe curves in the plane using equations involving x and y, so can we describe curves
using equations involving r and θ . Most common are equations of the form r = f (θ ).
Example 11.1: Circle in Polar Coordinates

Graph the curve given by r = 2.
Solution. All points with r = 2 are at distance 2 from the origin, so r = 2 describes the circle of radius 2
with center at the origin.
♣
Example 11.2: Cardioid

Graph the curve given by r = 1 + cos θ .
405

406

Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations

Solution. We first consider y = 1 + cos x, as in figure 11.2. As θ goes through the values in [0, 2π ], the
value of r tracks the value of y, forming the “cardioid” shape of figure 11.2. For example, when θ = π /2,
r = 1 + cos(π /2) = 1, so we graph the point at distance 1 from the origin along the positive√
y-axis, which
is at an angle of π /2 from the positive x-axis. When θ = 7π /4, r = 1 + cos(7π /4) = 1 + 2/2 ≈ 1.71,
and the corresponding point appears in the fourth quadrant. If we look at the curve, we should explain the
indentation which occurs at θ = π . It should be obvious that cos x < 0 on (π /2, 3π /2), thus r = 1 +cos θ <
1. Specifically, when θ = π , cos π = −1, so r = 0, and we get the resulting indentation. This illustrates one
of the potential benefits of using polar coordinates: the equation for this curve in rectangular coordinates
would be quite complicated.

Figure 11.2: A cardioid: y = 1 + cos x on the left, r = 1 + cos θ on the right.
Each point in the plane is associated with exactly one pair of numbers in the rectangular coordinate
system; each point is associated with an infinite number of pairs in polar coordinates. In the cardioid
example, we considered only the range 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π , and already there was a duplicate: (2, 0) and (2, 2π )
are the same point. Indeed, every value of θ outside the interval [0, 2π ) duplicates a point on the curve
r = 1 + cos θ when 0 ≤ θ < 2π . We can even make sense of polar coordinates like (−2, π /4): Go to the
direction π /4 and then move a distance 2 in the opposite direction; see figure 11.3. As usual, a negative
angle θ means an angle measured clockwise from the positive x-axis. The point in figure 11.3 also has
coordinates (2, 5π /4) and (2, −3π /4).

Figure 11.3: The point (−2, π /4) = (2, 5π /4) = (2, −3π /4) in polar coordinates.
The relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates is quite easy to understand. The point with
polar coordinates (r, θ ) has rectangular coordinates x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ ; this follows immediately
from the definition of the sine and cosine functions.
√ Using figure 11.3 as an example, the point
√ shown has
rectangular coordinates x = (−2) cos(π /4) = − 2 ≈ 1.4142 and y = (−2) sin(π /4) = − 2. This makes
it very easy to convert equations from rectangular to polar coordinates.

Example 11.4: Equation of a Circle

Find the equation of the circle (x − 1/2)2 + y2 = 1/4 in polar coordinates.
Solution. Again substituting: (r cos θ − 1/2)2 + r2 sin2 θ = 1/4. A bit of algebra turns this into r = cos(t).
You should try plotting a few (r, θ ) values to convince yourself that this makes sense.
♣
Example 11.5: Spiral of Archimedes

Graph the polar equation r = θ .
Solution. Here the distance from the origin exactly matches the angle, so a bit of thought makes it clear
that when θ ≥ 0 we get the spiral of Archimedes in figure 11.4. When θ < 0, r is also negative, and so the
full graph is the right hand picture in the figure.

Figure 11.4: The spiral of Archimedes and the full graph of r = θ .
Converting polar equations to rectangular equations can be somewhat trickier, and graphing polar
equations directly is also not always easy.
Example 11.6: Graphing Polar Equations

Graph r = 2 sin θ .
Solution. Given that the sine is periodic, we know that we will get the entire curve for values of θ in
[0, 2π ). As θ runs from 0 to π /2, r increases from 0 to 2. Then as θ continues to π , r decreases again
to 0. When θ runs from π to 2π , r is negative, and it is not hard to see that the first part of the curve is
simply traced out again, so in fact we get the whole curve for values of θ in [0, π ). Thus, the curve looks
something like figure 11.5. Now, this suggests that the curve could possibly be a circle, and if it is, it

408

Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations

would have to be the circle x2 + (y − 1)2 = 1. Having made this guess, we can easily check it. First we
substitute for x and y to get (r cos θ )2 + (r sin θ − 1)2 = 1; expanding and simplifying does indeed turn this
into r = 2 sin θ .

11.2 Slopes in Polar Coordinates
When we describe a curve using polar coordinates, it is still a curve in the x-y plane. We would like to be
able to compute slopes and areas for these curves using polar coordinates.
We have seen that x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ describe the relationship between polar and rectangular
coordinates. If in turn we are interested in a curve given by r = f (θ ), then we can write x = f (θ ) cos θ and
y = f (θ ) sin θ , describing x and y in terms of θ alone. The first of these equations describes θ implicitly
in terms of x, so using the chain rule we may compute
dy
dy d θ
=
.
dx d θ dx
Since d θ /dx = 1/(dx/d θ ), we can instead compute
dy dy/d θ
f (θ ) cos θ + f ′ (θ ) sin θ
=
.
=
dx dx/d θ
− f (θ ) sin θ + f ′ (θ ) cos θ
Example 11.7: Horizontal Tangent Line

Find the points at which the curve given by r = 1 + cos θ has a vertical or horizontal tangent line.
Solution. Since this function has period 2π , we may restrict our attention to the interval [0, 2π ) or (−π , π ],
as convenience dictates. First, we compute the slope:
dy
(1 + cos θ ) cos θ − sin θ sin θ
cos θ + cos2 θ − sin2 θ
=
=
.
dx −(1 + cos θ ) sin θ − sin θ cos θ
− sin θ − 2 sin θ cos θ
This fraction is zero when the numerator is zero (and the denominator is not zero). The numerator is
2 cos2 θ + cos θ − 1 so by the quadratic formula
√
−1 ± 1 + 4 · 2
1
cos θ =
= −1 or
.
4
2
This means θ is π or ±π /3. However, when θ = π , the denominator is also 0, so we cannot conclude that
the tangent line is horizontal.
Setting the denominator to zero we get
−θ − 2 sin θ cos θ = 0
sin θ (1 + 2 cos θ ) = 0,

410

Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations

so either sin θ = 0 or cos θ = −1/2. The first is true when θ is 0 or π , the second when θ is 2π /3 or
4π /3. However, as above, when θ = π , the numerator is also 0, so we cannot conclude that the tangent
line is vertical. Figure 11.6 shows points corresponding to θ equal to 0, ±1.318, 2π /3 and 4π /3 on the
graph of the function. Note that when θ = π the curve hits the origin and does not have a tangent line.

11.3 Areas in Polar Coordinates
We can use the equation of a curve in polar coordinates to compute some areas bounded by such curves.
The basic approach is the same as with any application of integration: Find an approximation that approaches the true value. For areas in rectangular coordinates, we approximated the region using rectangles; in polar coordinates, we use sectors of circles, as depicted in Figure 11.7. Recall that the area of a
sector of a circle is α r2 /2, where α is the angle subtended by the sector. If the curve is given by r = f (θ ),
and the angle subtended by a small sector is ∆θ , the area is (∆θ )( f (θ ))2/2. Thus we approximate the
total area as
n−1
1
∑ 2 f ( θ i ) 2 ∆θ .
i=0
As a limit, this will give rise to:

As in the example above, if a function is defined over the complete region [0, 2π ], then the bounds for
the integral are a = 0, b = 2π . However, sometimes we need to be careful!

Find the area inside the loop r = cos θ .
Solution. We look for points of intersection.
√
0 = cos θ
0 = cos θ
This has solutions θ = π /2 and
√ 3π /2, but we must select our bounds for integration correctly. Since cos θ
is negative on (π /2, 3π /3), cos θ is undefined. Note that one full revolution is 2π ; that is, the function
is 2π periodic. If √
we were to integrate on [3π /2, π /2] we would get the same answer, and can avoid a
scenario in which cos θ is undefined. Equivalently, we can integrate on [−π /2, π /2].

Find the area between the circles r = 2 and r = 4 sin θ , as shown in figure 11.8.

This first example makes the process appear more straightforward than it is. Since points have many
different representations in polar coordinates, it is not always so easy to identify points of intersection.
Example 11.12: Shaded Area

Find the shaded area in the first graph of figure 11.9 as the difference of the other two shaded areas.
The cardioid is r = 1 + sin θ and the circle is r = 3 sin θ .
Solution. We attempt to find points of intersection:
1 + sin θ = 3 sin θ
1 = 2 sin θ
1/2 = sin θ .
This has solutions θ = π /6 and 5π /6; π /6 corresponds to the intersection in the first quadrant that we
need. Note that no solution of this equation corresponds to the intersection point at the origin, but fortunately that one is obvious. The cardioid goes through the origin when θ = −π /2; the circle goes through
the origin at multiples of π , starting with 0.

11.4 Parametric Equations
When we computed the derivative dy/dx using polar coordinates, we used the expressions x = f (θ ) cos θ
and y = f (θ ) sin θ . These two equations completely specify the curve, though the form r = f (θ ) is simpler.
The expanded form has the virtue that it can easily be generalized to describe a wider range of curves than
can be specified in rectangular or polar coordinates.
Suppose f (t) and g(t) are functions. Then the equations x = f (t) and y = g(t) describe a curve in the
plane. In the case of the polar coordinates equations, the variable t is replaced by θ which has a natural
geometric interpretation. In general, t is simply an arbitrary variable, often called in this case a parameter,
and this method of specifying a curve is known as parametric equations. One important interpretation of
t is time. In this interpretation, the equations x = f (t) and y = g(t) give the position of an object at time t.
Example 11.13: Position of a Path

Describe the path of an object that moves so that its position at time t is given by x = cost , y = cos2 t .

416

Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations

Solution. We see immediately that y = x2 , so the path lies on this parabola. The path is not the entire
parabola, however, since x = cost is always between −1 and 1. It is now easy to see that the object
oscillates back and forth on the parabola between the endpoints (1, 1) and (−1, 1), and is at point (1, 1) at
♣
time t = 0.
It is sometimes quite easy to describe a complicated path in parametric equations when rectangular
and polar coordinate expressions are difficult or impossible to devise.
Example 11.14: Wheel

A wheel of radius 1 rolls along a straight line, say the x-axis. A point on the rim of the wheel will
trace out a curve, called a cycloid. Assume the point starts at the origin; find parametric equations
for the curve.
Solution. Figure 11.11 illustrates the generation of the curve. The wheel is shown at its starting point, and
again after it has rolled through about 490 degrees. We take as our parameter t the angle through which
the wheel has turned, measured as shown clockwise from the line connecting the center of the wheel to
the ground. Since the radius is 1, the center of the wheel has coordinates (t, 1). We seek to write the
coordinates of the point on the rim as (t + ∆x, 1 + ∆y), where ∆x and ∆y are as shown in figure 11.12.
These values are nearly the sine and cosine of the angle t, from the unit circle definition of sine and cosine.
However, some care is required because we are measuring t from a nonstandard starting line and in a
clockwise direction, as opposed to the usual counterclockwise direction. A bit of thought reveals that
∆x = − sint and ∆y = − cost. Thus the parametric equations for the cycloid are x = t − sint, y = 1 − cost.

between the center of the wheel and the rim; assume P starts at the point (0, 1/2). As the wheel rolls, P
traces a curve; find parametric equations for the curve.

11.5 Calculus with Parametric Equations
We have already seen how to compute slopes of curves given by parametric equations—it is how we
computed slopes in polar coordinates.
Example 11.15: Slope of Cycloid

Find the slope of the cycloid x = t − sint , y = 1 − cost .
Solution. We compute x′ = 1 − cost, y′ = sint, so
dy
sint
=
.
dx 1 − cost
Note that when t is an odd multiple of π , like π or 3π , this is (0/2) = 0, so there is a horizontal tangent
line, in agreement with figure 11.11. At even multiples of π , the fraction is 0/0, which is undefined. The
figure shows that there is no tangent line at such points.
♣
Areas can be a bit trickier with parametric equations, depending on the curve and the area desired. We
can potentially compute areas between the curve and the x-axis quite easily.

418

Example 11.16: Area Under Cycloid Arch

Find the area under one arch of the cycloid x = t − sint , y = 1 − cost .
Solution. We would like to compute
Z 2π

y dx,

0

but we do not know y in terms of x. However, the parametric equations allow us to make a substitution:
use y = 1 − cost to replace y, and compute dx = (1 − cost) dt. Then the integral becomes
Z 2π
0

(1 − cost)(1 − cost) dt = 3π .

Note that we need to convert the original x limits to t limits using x = t − sint. When x = 0, t = sint,
which happens only when t = 0. Likewise, when x = 2π , t − 2π = sint and t = 2π . Alternately, because
we understand how the cycloid is produced, we can see directly that one arch is generated by 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π .
In general, of course, the t limits will be different than the x limits.
♣
This technique will allow us to compute some quite interesting areas, as illustrated by the exercises.
As a final example, we see how to compute the length of a curve given by parametric equations. The
arc length for functions given as y in terms of x is the formula:

11.6 Conics in Polar Coordinates
A conic section is a curve obtained as the intersection of a cone and a plane. One useful geometric
definition that only involves the plane is that a conic consists of those points whose distances to some
point, called a focus, and some line, called a directrix, are in a fixed ratio, called the eccentricity.
The three types of conic sections are the ellipse, parabola and hyperbola (with the circle being a
degenerate case of an ellipse).

420

Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations

Circle
Ellipse
Parabola
Hyperbola

Let F be a fixed point (the focus), L be a line (the directrix) not containing F and e be a nonnegative
real number (the eccentricity). The conics sections are obtained by the set of all points P whose distance
to F equals e times their distance to L, that is:
|PF|
= e.
|PL|
In the case that:
• e < 1 we obtain an ellipse (and when e = 0 we obtain the degenerate case: A circle),
• e = 1 we obtain a parabola,
• e > 1 we obtain a hyperbola.
To obtain a simple polar equation we place the focal point at the origin. The formulation for a conic
section is then given in the polar form by
r=

pe
1 ± e cos θ

and

r=

pe
1 ± e sin θ

where e is the eccentricity and p is the focal parameter representing the distance from the focus (or one of
the two foci) to the directrix.
The three different types of conic sections are shown below. Focal points corresponding to all conic

11.6. Conics in Polar Coordinates
sections are placed at the origin. First is the parabola.

Next is the ellipse.

421

422

Polar Coordinates, Parametric Equations

Finally, we have the hyperbola.

Some things to keep in mind with respect to the denominator of polar equations of various conics are
the following:
• If the denominator is 1 + e sin θ , it has a horizontal directrix above the focal point.
• If the denominator is 1 − e sin θ , it has a horizontal directrix below the focal point.

• If the denominator is 1 + e cos θ , it has a vertical directrix to the right of the focal point.
• If the denominator is 1 − e cos θ , it has a vertical directrix to the left of the focal point.
Example 11.18: Polar Equations for a Parabola

Find the equation of a parabola with focus at the origin and whose directrix is the line x = −1.
Solution. Since we have a parabola, e = 1. Furthermore, p = 1. Since the graph has a vertical directrix,
the equation will use 1 − e cos θ in the denominator. Thus, the equation is:
r=

1 − sin θ

12. Three Dimensions
12.1 The Coordinate System
Throughout the text thus far we have focused investigating functions of the form y = f (x), with one
independent and one dependent variable. Such functions can be represented in two dimensions, using two
numerical axes that allow us to identify every point in the plane with two numbers. We now shift our focus
to three-dimensional space; to identify every point in three dimensions we require three numerical values.
The obvious way to make this association is to add one new axis, perpendicular to the x and y axes we
already understand. We could, for example, add a third axis, the z axis, with the positive z axis coming
straight out of the page, and the negative z axis going out the back of the page. This is difficult to work
with on a printed page, so more often we draw a view of the three axes from an angle:
y

You must then imagine that the z axis is perpendicular to the other two. Just as we have investigated
functions of the form y = f (x) in two dimensions, we will investigate three dimensions largely by considering functions; now the functions will (typically) have the form z = f (x, y). Due to the fact that we are
used to having the result of a function graphed in the vertical direction, it is somewhat easier to maintain
that convention in three dimensions. To accomplish this, we normally rotate the axes so that z points up;
the result is then:

Note that if you imagine looking down from above, along the z axis, the positive z axis will come
straight toward you, the positive y axis will point up, and the positive x axis will point to your right, as
usual. Any point in space is identified by providing the three coordinates of the point, as shown; naturally,
we list the coordinates in the order (x, y, z). One useful way to think of this is to use the x and y coordinates
to identify a point in the x-y plane, then move straight up (or down) a distance given by the z coordinate.
It is now fairly simple to understand some “shapes” in three dimensions that correspond to simple
conditions on the coordinates. In two dimensions the equation x = 1 describes the vertical line through
(1, 0). In three dimensions, it still describes all points with x-coordinate 1, but this is now a plane, as in
Figure 12.1.

Recall the very useful distance formula in two dimensions which
comes directly from the Pythagorean
p
Theorem: the distance between points (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) is (x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2 . What is the distance between two points (x1 , y1 , z1 ) and (x2 , y2 , z2 ) in three dimensions? Geometrically, we want the length
of the long diagonal labelled c in the “box” in Figure 12.2. Since a, b, c form a right triangle, a2 + b2 = c2 .
b is the vertical distance between (x1 , y1 , z1 ) and (x2 , y2 , z2 ), so b = |z1 − z2 |. The length a runs parallel to

12.1. The Coordinate System

427

the x-y plane, so it is simply the distance between (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , yp
2 ), that is, a = (x1 − x2 ) + (y1 − y2 ) .
Now we see that c2 = (x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2 + (z1 − z2 )2 and c = (x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2 + (z1 − z2 )2 .
It is sometimes useful to give names to points, for example we might let P1 = (x1 , y1 , z1 ), or more
concisely we might refer to the point P1 (x1 , y1 , z1 ), and subsequently use just P1 . Distance between two
points in either two or three dimensions is sometimes denoted by d, so for example the formula for the
distance between P1 (x1 , y1 , z1 ) and P2 (x2 , y2 , z2 ) might be expressed as
q
d(P1 , P2 ) = (x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2 + (z1 − z2 )2 .

Figure 12.2: Distance in three dimensions.
In two dimensions, the distance formula immediately gives us the equation of a circle: the circle
of radius
p r and center at (h, k) consists of all points (x, y) at distance r from (h, k), so the equation is
r = (x − h)2 + (y − k)2 or r2 = (x − h)2 + (y − k)2 . Now we can get the similar equation r2 = (x − h)2 +
(y − k)2 + (z − l)2 , which describes all points (x, y, z) at distance r from (h, k, l), namely, the sphere with
radius r and center (h, k, l).

12.2. Vectors

12.2 Vectors
A vector, denoted v, is a quantity consisting of a non-negative magnitude and a direction. We could
represent a vector in two dimensions as (m, θ ), where m is the magnitude and θ is the direction, measured
as an angle from some agreed upon direction. For example, we might think of the vector (5, 45◦ ) as
representing “5 km toward the northeast”; that is, this vector might be a displacement vector, indicating,
say, that your grandfather walked 5 kilometers toward the northeast to school in the snow. On the other
hand, the same vector could represent a velocity, indicating that your grandfather walked at 5 km/hr
toward the northeast. What the vector does not indicate is where this walk occurred: a vector represents a
magnitude and a direction, but not a location. Pictorially it is useful to represent a vector as an arrow; the
direction of the vector, naturally, is the direction in which the arrow points; the magnitude of the vector is
reflected in the length of the arrow.
It turns out that many, many quantities behave as vectors, e.g., displacement, velocity, acceleration,
force. Already we can get some idea of their usefulness using displacement vectors. Suppose that your
grandfather walked 5 km NE and then 2 km SSE; if the terrain allows, and perhaps armed with a compass,
how could your grandfather have walked directly to his destination? We can use vectors (and a bit of
geometry) to answer this question. We begin by noting that since vectors do not include a specification of
position, we can “place” them anywhere that is convenient. So we can picture your grandfather’s journey
as two displacement vectors drawn head to tail:

The displacement vector for the shortcut route is the vector drawn with a dashed line, from the tail of
the first to the head of the second. With a little trigonometry, we can compute that the third vector has
magnitude approximately 4.62 and direction 21.43◦, so walking 4.62 km in the direction 21.43◦ north of
east (approximately ENE) would get your grandfather to school. This sort of calculation is so common,
we dignify it with a name: we say that the third vector is the sum of the other two vectors.
There is another common way to picture the sum of two vectors. Put the vectors tail to tail and then
complete the parallelogram they indicate; the sum of the two vectors is the diagonal of the parallelogram:

This is a more natural representation in some circumstances. For example, if the two original vectors

430

Three Dimensions

represent forces acting on an object, the sum of the two vectors is the net or effective force on the object,
and it is convenient to draw all three with their tails at the location of the object.
We also define scalar multiplication for vectors: if v is a vector (m, θ ) and a ≥ 0 is a real number,
the vector av is (am, θ ), namely, it points in the same direction but has a times the magnitude. If a < 0,
av is (|a|m, θ + π ), with |a| times the magnitude and pointing in the opposite direction (unless we specify
otherwise, angles are measured in radians).
Now we can understand subtraction of vectors: v − w = v + (−1)w:

Note that as you would expect, w + (v − w) = v.
We can represent a vector in ways other than (m, θ ), and in fact (m, θ ) is not generally used at all.
How else could we describe a particular vector? Consider again the vector (5, 45◦). Let’s draw it again,
but impose a coordinate
√
√ system. If we put the tail of the arrow at the origin, the head of the arrow ends up
at the point (5/ 2, 5/ 2) ≈ (3.54, 3.54).

In this picture the coordinates (3.54, 3.54) identify the head of the arrow, provided we know that the
tail of the arrow has been placed at (0, 0). Then in fact the vector can always be identified as (3.54, 3.54),
no matter where it is placed; we just have to remember that the numbers 3.54 must be interpreted as a
change from the position of the tail, not as the actual coordinates of the arrow head; to emphasize this we
will write h3.54, 3.54i to mean the vector and (3.54, 3.54) to mean the point. Then if the vector h3.54, 3.54i
is drawn with its tail at (1, 2) it looks like this:

It is clear from the picture that the coordinates of the destination point are (5/√ 2+2 cos(−3π /8), 5/√ 2+
2 sin(−3π /8)) or approximately (4.3, 1.69), so the sum of the two vectors is h5/ 2+2 cos(−3π /8), 5/ 2+
2 sin(−3π /8)i ≈ h4.3, 1.69i. Adding the two vectors is easier in this form than in the (m, θ ) form, provided
that we’re willing to have the answer in this form as well.
It is easy to see that scalar multiplication and vector subtraction are also easy to compute in this form:
ahv, wi = hav, awi and hv1 , w1 i − hv2 , w2 i = hv1 − v2 , w1 − w2 i. What about the magnitude? The magnitude
of the vector hv, wi is still the length of the corresponding arrow representation; this is the distance from
the origin to the point (v, w), namely, the distance from theptail to the head of the arrow. Using the familiar
distance formula the p
magnitude of the vector is simply v2 + w2 , which we also denote with absolute
value bars: |hv, wi| = v2 + w2 .
In three dimensions, vectors are still quantities consisting of a magnitude and a direction, but of course
there are many more possible directions. It’s not clear how we might represent the direction explicitly,
but the coordinate version of vectors makes just as much sense in three dimensions as in two. By h1, 2, 3i
we mean the vector whose head is at (1, 2, 3) if its tail is at the origin. As before, we can place the vector
anywhere we want; if it has its tail at (4, 5, 6) then its head is at (5, 7, 9). It remains true that arithmetic is
easy to do with vectors in this form.
Arithmetic of Vectors
Sum of vectors:
hv1 , v2 , v3 i + hw1 , w2 , w3 i = hv1 + w1 , v2 + w2 , v3 + w3 i
Scalar Multiplication of vectors:
ahv1 , v2 , v3 i = hav1 , av2 , av3 i
Subtraction of vectors:
hv1 , v2 , v3 i − hw1 , w2 , w3 i = hv1 − w1 , v2 − w2 , v3 − w3 i
The magnitude
q of the vector is the distance from the origin to the head of the vector, or
|hv1 , v2 , v3 i| = v21 + v22 + v23 .

Figure 12.3: The vector h2, 4, 5i with its tail at the origin.
Three particularly simple vectors turn out to be quite useful: i = h1, 0, 0i, j = h0, 1, 0i, and k = h0, 0, 1i.
These play much the same role for vectors that the axes play for points. In particular, notice that
hv1 , v2 , v3 i = hv1 , 0, 0i + h0, v2, 0i + h0, 0, v3 i
= v1 h1, 0, 0i + v2 h0, 1, 0i + v3h0, 0, 1i
= v1 i + v2 j + v3 k
Thus far, we have focused our discussion on vectors which begin at the origin and end at a point.
However we will frequently want to produce a vector that points from one point to another. That is, if P
and Q are points, we seek the vector x such that when the tail of x is placed at P, its head is at Q; we refer
−→
to this vector as PQ. If we know the coordinates of P and Q, the coordinates of the vector are easy to find.
Example 12.1:
−→
Suppose P = (1, −2, 4) and Q = (−2, 1, 3). The vector PQ is h−2 − 1, 1 − −2, 3 − 4i = h−3, 3, −1i

12.3 The Dot Product
The goal of this section is to answer the following question. Given two vectors, what is the angle between
them?
Since vectors have no position, we are free to place vectors wherever we like. If the two vectors are
placed tail-to-tail, there is now a reasonable interpretation of the question: we seek the measure of the
smallest angle between the two vectors, in the plane in which they lie. Figure 12.4 illustrates the situation.

Figure 12.4: The angle between vectors v and w.
Since the angle θ lies in a triangle, we can compute it using a bit of trigonometry, namely, the law of
cosines. Remember that the law of cosines states c2 = a2 + b2 − 2ab cosC.
The lengths of the sides of the triangle in Figure 12.4 are |v|, |w|, and |v − w|. Let v = hv1 , v2 , v3 i and
w = hw1 , w2 , w3 i; then
|v − w|2 = |v|2 + |w|2 − 2|v||w| cos θ

2|v||w| cos θ = |v|2 + |w|2 − |v − w|2

= v21 + v22 + v23 + w21 + w22 + w23 − (v1 − w1 )2 − (v2 − w2 )2 − (v3 − w3 )2
= v21 + v22 + v23 + w21 + w22 + w23

− (v21 − 2v1 w1 + w21 ) − (v22 − 2v2 w2 + w22 ) − (v23 − 2v3 w3 + w23 )
= 2v1 w1 + 2v2 w2 + 2v3 w3
|v||w| cos θ = v1 w1 + v2 w2 + v3 w3
cos θ = (v1 w1 + v2 w2 + v3 w3 )/(|v||w|)
A bit of simple arithmetic with the coordinates of v and w allows us to compute the cosine of the angle
between them. If necessary we can use the arccosine to get θ , but in many problems cos θ turns out to be
all we really need.
The numerator of the fraction that gives us cos θ turns up a lot, so we give it a name and more compact
notation: we call it the dot product, and write it as
v · w = v1 w1 + v2 w2 + v3 w3
This is the same symbol we use for ordinary multiplication, but there should never be any confusion; you
can tell from context whether we are “multiplying” vectors or numbers. (We might also use the dot for
scalar multiplication: a · v = av; again, it is clear what is meant from context.)
Example 12.2:

Find the angle between the vectors v = h1, 2, 1i and w = h3, 1, −5i.
Solution. We know that cos θ = v · w/(|v||w|) = (1 · 3 + 2 · 1 + 1 · (−5))/(|v||w|) = 0, so θ = π /2, that is,
♣
the vectors are perpendicular.
Example 12.3:

Find the angle between the vectors v = h3, 3, 0i and w = h1, 0, 0i.

The following are some special cases worth looking at.

2. v and −v
3. v and 0 = h0, 0, 0i
Solution.
q
q
1. cos θ = v · v/(|v||v|) = (v21 + v22 + v23 )/( v21 + v22 + v23 v21 + v22 + v23 ) = 1, so the angle between v
and itself is zero, which of course is correct.
q
q
2. cos θ = v · −v/(|v|| − v|) = (−v21 − v22 − v23 )/( v21 + v22 + v23 v21 + v22 + v23 ) = −1, so the angle is π ,
that is, the vectors point in opposite directions, as of course we already knew.
q
p
3. cos θ = v · 0/(|v||0|) = (0 +0 +0)/( v21 + v22 + v23 02 + 02 + 02 ), which is undefined. On the other
hand, note that since v · 0 = 0 it looks at first as if cos θ will be zero, which as we have seen means
that vectors are perpendicular; only when we notice that the denominator is also zero do we run into
trouble. One way to “fix” this is to adopt the convention that the zero vector 0 is perpendicular to all
vectors; then we can say in general that if v · w = 0, v and w are perpendicular.
♣
Generalizing the examples, note the following useful facts:
• If v is parallel or anti-parallel to w then v · w/(|v||w|) = ±1, and conversely, if v · w/(|v||w|) = 1,
v and w are parallel, while if v · w/(|v||w|) = −1, v and w are anti-parallel. (Vectors are parallel if
they point in the same direction, anti-parallel if they point in opposite directions.)
• If v is perpendicular to w then v · w/(|v||w|) = 0, and conversely if v · w/(|v||w|) = 0 then v and w
are perpendicular.
Given two vectors, it is often useful to find the projection of one vector onto the other, because this
turns out to have important meaning in many circumstances. More precisely, given v and w, we seek a
vector parallel to w but with length determined by v in a natural way, as shown in Figure 12.5. p is chosen
so that the triangle formed by v, p, and v − p is a right triangle.

Using a little trigonometry, we see that
|p| = |v| cos θ = |v|

v·w
v·w

|v||w|
|w|

this is sometimes called the scalar projection of v onto w. To get p itself, we multiply this length by a
vector of length one parallel to w:
v·w w
v·w
p=
=
w.
|w| |w| |w|2

Be sure that you understand why w/|w| is a vector of length one (also called a unit vector) parallel to w.
The discussion so far implicitly assumed that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π /2. If π /2 < θ ≤ π , the picture is like Figure 12.6. In this case v · w is negative, so the vector
v·w
w
|w|2
is anti-parallel to w, and its length is
v·w
.
|w|

In general, the scalar projection of v onto w may be positive or negative. If it is negative, it means that
the projection vector is anti-parallel to w and that the length of the projection vector is the absolute value
of the scalar projection. Of course, you can also compute the length of the projection vector as usual, by
applying the distance formula to the vector.

Note that the phrase “projection onto w” is a bit misleading if taken literally; all that w provides is a
direction; the length of w has no impact on the final vector. In Figure 12.7, for example, w is shorter than
the projection vector, but this is perfectly acceptable.

Physical force is a vector quantity. It is often necessary to compute the “component” of a force acting
in a different direction than the force is being applied.
Example 12.5: Components of Force Vector

Suppose a ten pound weight is resting on an inclined plane—a pitched roof, for example. Gravity
exerts a force of ten pounds on the object, directed straight down. It is useful to think of the component of this force directed down and parallel to the roof, and the component down and directly into
the roof. These forces are the projections of the force vector onto vectors parallel and perpendicular
to the roof. Suppose the roof is tilted at a 30◦ angle, as in Figure 12.8. Compute the component of
the force directed down the roof and the component of the force directed into the roof.
√
√
Solution. A vector parallel to the roof is h− 3, −1i, and a vector perpendicular to the roof is h1, − 3i.
The force vector is F = h0, −10i. The component of the force directed down the roof is then
√
√
√
10 h− 3, −1i
F · h− 3, −1i √

h− 3, −1i =

F1 =

with length 5. The component of the force directed into the roof is

|h1, − 3i|2

with length 5 3. Thus, a force of 5 pounds is pulling the object down the roof, while a force of 5 3
pounds is pulling the object into the roof.

12.4 The Cross Product
Suppose we are given two vectors. In many cases it is useful to find a third vector perpendicular to the
first two. There are of course an infinite number of such vectors of different lengths. Nevertheless, let
us find one. Suppose v = hv1 , v2 , v3 i and w = hw1 , w2 , w3 i. We want to find a vector c = hc1 , c2 , c3 i with
c · v = c · w = 0, or
v1 c1 + v2 c2 + v3 c3 = 0,
w1 c1 + w2 c2 + w3 c3 = 0.
Multiply the first equation by w3 and the second by v3 and subtract to get
w3 v1 c1 + w3 v2 c2 + w3 v3 c3 = 0
v3 w1 c1 + v3 w2 c2 + v3 w3 c3 = 0
(v1 w3 − w1 v3 )c1 + (v2 w3 − w2 v3 )c2 = 0
Of course, this equation in two variables has many solutions; a particularly easy one to see is c1 = v2 w3 −
w2 v3 , c2 = w1 v3 − v1 w3 . Substituting back into either of the original equations and solving for c3 gives
c3 = v1 w2 − w1 v2 .
This particular answer to the problem turns out to have some nice properties, and it is dignified with a
name: the cross product:
v × w = hv2 w3 − w2 v3 , w1 v3 − v1 w3 , v1 w2 − w1 v2 i.
While there is a nice pattern to this vector, it can be a bit difficult to memorize; here is a convenient
mnemonic. The determinant of a two by two matrix is
a b
= ad − cb.
c d
This is extended to the determinant of a three by three matrix:
x y
z
v v3
v v3
v v2
v1 v2 v3 = x 2
−y 1
+z 1
w2 w3
w1 w3
w1 w2
w1 w2 w3
= x(v2 w3 − w2 v3 ) − y(v1 w3 − w1 v3 ) + z(v1 w2 − w1 v2 )
= x(v2 w3 − w2 v3 ) + y(w1 v3 − v1 w3 ) + z(v1 w2 − w1 v2 ).
Each of the two by two matrices is formed by deleting the top row and one column of the three by three
matrix; the subtraction of the middle term must also be memorized. This is not the place to extol the uses of
the determinant; suffice it to say that determinants are extraordinarily useful and important. Here we want
to use it merely as a mnemonic device. You will have noticed that the three expressions in parentheses on
the last line are precisely the three coordinates of the cross product; replacing x, y, z by i, j, k gives us
i
j k
v1 v2 v3 = (v2 w3 − w2 v3 )i − (v1 w3 − w1 v3 )j + (v1 w2 − w1 v2 )k
w1 w2 w3

12.4. The Cross Product

= (v2 w3 − w2 v3 )i + (w1 v3 − v1 w3 )j + (v1 w2 − w1 v2 )k
= hv2 w3 − w2 v3 , w1 v3 − v1 w3 , v1 w2 − w1 v2 i
= v × w.
Given v and w, there are typically two possible directions and an infinite number of magnitudes that
will give a vector perpendicular to both v and w. As we have picked a particular one, we should investigate
the magnitude and direction.
We know how to compute the magnitude of v × w; it’s a bit messy but not difficult. It is somewhat
easier to work initially with the square of the magnitude, so as to avoid the square root:
|v × w|2 = (v2 w3 − w2 v3 )2 + (w1 v3 − v1 w3 )2 + (v1 w2 − w1 v2 )2

= v22 w23 − 2v2 w3 w2 v3 + w22 v23 + w21 v23 − 2w1 v3 v1 w3 + v21 w23 + v21 w22 − 2v1 w2 w1 v2 + w21 v22

While it is far from obvious, this nasty looking expression can be simplified:
|v × w|2 = (v21 + v22 + v23 )(w21 + w22 + w23 ) − (v1 w1 + v2 w2 + v3 w3 )2
= |v|2 |w|2 − (v · w)2

= |v|2 |w|2 − |v|2 |w|2 cos2 θ

= |v|2 |w|2 (1 − cos2 θ )

= |v|2 |w|2 sin2 θ
|v × w| = |v||w| sin θ

The magnitude of v × w is thus very similar to the dot product. In particular, notice that if v is parallel
to w, the angle between them is zero, so sin θ = 0, so |v × w| = 0, and likewise if they are anti-parallel,
sin θ = 0, and |v × w| = 0. Conversely, if |v × w| = 0 and |v| and |w| are not zero, it must be that sin θ = 0,
so v is parallel or anti-parallel to w.
Here is a curious fact about this quantity that turns out to be quite useful later on: Given two vectors,
we can put them tail to tail and form a parallelogram, as in Figure 12.10. The height of the parallelogram,
h, is |v| sin θ , and the base is |w|, so the area of the parallelogram is |v||w| sin θ , exactly the magnitude of
|v × w|.

What about the direction of the cross product? Remarkably, there is a simple rule that describes the
direction. Let’s look at a simple example: Let v = ha, 0, 0i, w = hb, c, 0i. If the vectors are placed with
tails at the origin, v lies along the x-axis and w lies in the x-y plane, so we know the cross product will
point either up or down. The cross product is
i j k
v × w = a 0 0 = h0, 0, aci.
b c 0

442

Three Dimensions

As predicted, this is a vector pointing up or down, depending on the sign of ac. Suppose that a > 0, so
the sign depends only on c: if c > 0, ac > 0 and the vector points up; if c < 0, the vector points down.
On the other hand, if a < 0 and c > 0, the vector points down, while if a < 0 and c < 0, the vector points
up. Here is how to interpret these facts with a single rule: Imagine rotating vector v until it points in the
same direction as w; there are two ways to do this—use the rotation that goes through the smaller angle.
If a > 0 and c > 0, or a < 0 and c < 0, the rotation will be counter-clockwise when viewed from above;
in the other two cases, v must be rotated clockwise to reach w. The rule is: counter-clockwise means up,
clockwise means down. If v and w are any vectors in the x-y plane, the same rule applies—v need not be
parallel to the x-axis.
Although it is somewhat difficult computationally to see how this plays out for any two starting vectors,
the rule is essentially the same. Place v and w tail to tail. The plane in which v and w lie may be viewed
from two sides; view it from the side for which v must rotate counter-clockwise to reach w; then the vector
v × w points toward you.
This rule is usually called the right hand rule. Imagine placing the heel of your right hand at the point
where the tails are joined, so that your slightly curled fingers indicate the direction of rotation from v to
w. Then your thumb points in the direction of the cross product v × w.
One immediate consequence of these facts is that v × w 6= w × v, because the two cross products point
in the opposite direction. On the other hand, since
|v × w| = |v|| w| sin θ = |w||v| sin θ = |w × v|,
the lengths of the two cross products are equal, so we know that v × w = −(w × v).
The cross product has some familiar-looking properties that will be useful later, so we list them here.
As with the dot product, these can be proved by performing the appropriate calculations on coordinates,
after which we may sometimes avoid such calculations by using the properties.
Theorem 12.7: Cross Product Properties

If u, v, and w are vectors and a is a real number, then
1. u × (v + w) = u × v + u × w
2. (v + w) × u = v × u + w × u

12.5 Lines and Planes
Lines and planes are perhaps the simplest of curves and surfaces in three dimensional space. They also
will prove important as we seek to understand more complicated curves and surfaces.
You may recall that the equation of a line in two dimensions is ax + by = c; it is reasonable to expect
that a line in three dimensions is given by ax + by + cz = d. However it turns out that this is the equation
of a plane. We will turn our attention to a study of planes and return to consider lines later in this section.
A plane does not have an obvious “direction” as does a line. It is possible to associate a plane with
a direction in a very useful way, however: there are exactly two directions perpendicular to a plane. Any
vector with one of these two directions is called normal to the plane. While there are many normal vectors
to a given plane, they are all parallel or anti-parallel to each other.
Suppose two points (v1 , v2 , v3 ) and (w1 , w2 , w3 ) are in a plane; then the vector hw1 −v1 , w2 −v2 , w3 −v3 i
is parallel to the plane. In particular, if this vector is placed with its tail at (v1 , v2 , v3 ) then its head is at
(w1 , w2 , w3 ) and it lies in the plane. As a result, any vector perpendicular to the plane is perpendicular
to hw1 − v1 , w2 − v2 , w3 − v3 i. In fact, it is easy to see that the plane consists of precisely those points
(w1 , w2 , w3 ) for which hw1 − v1 , w2 − v2 , w3 − v3 i is perpendicular to a normal to the plane, as indicated in
Figure 12.11. Turning this around, suppose we know that ha, b, ci is normal to a plane containing the point
(v1 , v2 , v3 ). Then (x, y, z) is in the plane if and only if ha, b, ci is perpendicular to hx − v1 , y − v2 , z − v3 i. In

444

Three Dimensions

turn, we know that this is true precisely when ha, b, ci · hx − v1, y − v2 , z − v3 i = 0. That is, (x, y, z) is in the
plane if and only if
ha, b, ci · hx − v1 , y − v2 , z − v3 i = 0
a(x − v1 ) + b(y − v2 ) + c(z − v3 ) = 0
ax + by + cz − av1 − bv2 − cv3 = 0
ax + by + cz = av1 + bv2 + cv3 .
Working backwards, note that if (x, y, z) is a point satisfying ax + by + cz = d then
ax + by + cz = d
ax + by + cz − d = 0
a(x − d/a) + b(y − 0) + c(z − 0) = 0
ha, b, ci · hx − d/a, y, zi = 0.
Namely, ha, b, ci is perpendicular to the vector with tail at (d/a, 0, 0) and head at (x, y, z). This means that
the points (x, y, z) that satisfy the equation ax + by + cz = d form a plane perpendicular to ha, b, ci. (This
doesn’t work if a = 0, but in that case we can use b or c in the role of a. That is, either a(x − 0) + b(y −
d/b) + c(z − 0) = 0 or a(x − 0) + b(y − 0) + c(z − d/c) = 0.)

Figure 12.11: A plane defined via vectors perpendicular to a normal.
Thus, given a vector ha, b, ci we know that all planes perpendicular to this vector have the form ax +
by + cz = d, and any surface of this form is a plane perpendicular to ha, b, ci.

12.5. Lines and Planes

445

Standard Form of a Plane
Any plane can be written in the form
ax + by + cz = d
where a, b, c, d are constants and not all a, b, c are zero.
This plane is perpendicular to the vector ha, b, ci.
Example 12.8: Perpendicular Plane

Find an equation for the plane perpendicular to h1, 2, 3i and containing the point (5, 0, 7).
Solution. Using the formula above, the plane is 1x + 2y + 3z = d. To find d we may substitute the known
point on the plane to get 5 + 2 · 0 + 3 · 7 = d, so d = 26.
♣
Example 12.9: Normal Vector

Find a vector normal to the plane 2x − 3y + z = 15.
Solution. One example is h2, −3, 1i. Any vector parallel or anti-parallel to this works as well, so for
example −2h2, −3, 1i = h−4, 6, −2i is also normal to the plane.
♣
We will frequently need to find an equation for a plane given certain information about the plane.
While there may occasionally be slightly shorter ways to get to the desired result, it is always possible,
and usually advisable, to use the given information to find a normal to the plane and a point on the plane,
and then to find the equation as above.
Example 12.10: Plane Perpendicular

The planes x − z = 1 and y + 2z = 3 intersect in a line. Find a third plane that contains this line and
is perpendicular to the plane x + y − 2z = 1.
Solution. First, we note that two planes are perpendicular if and only if their normal vectors are perpendicular. Thus, we seek a vector ha, b, ci that is perpendicular to h1, 1, −2i. In addition, since the desired
plane is to contain a certain line, ha, b, ci must be perpendicular to any vector parallel to this line. Since
ha, b, ci must be perpendicular to two vectors, we may find it by computing the cross product of the two.
Therefore we need a vector parallel to the line of intersection of the given planes. For this, it suffices to
know two points on the line. To find two points on this line, we must find two points that are simultaneously
on the two planes, x − z = 1 and y + 2z = 3. Any point on both planes will satisfy x − z = 1 and y + 2z = 3.
It is easy to find values for x and z satisfying the first, such as x = 1, z = 0 and x = 2, z = 1. Then we can
find corresponding values for y using the second equation, namely y = 3 and y = 1, so (1, 3, 0) and (2, 1, 1)
are two such points. They are both on the line of intersection since they are contained in both planes.
Now h2−1, 1−3, 1−0i = h1, −2, 1i is parallel to the line. Finally, we may choose ha, b, ci = h1, 1, −2i×
h1, −2, 1i = h−3, −3, −3i. While this vector will do perfectly well, any vector parallel or anti-parallel to

446

Three Dimensions

it will work as well. For example we might choose h1, 1, 1i which is anti-parallel to it, and easier to work
with.
Now we know that h1, 1, 1i is normal to the desired plane and (2, 1, 1) is a point on the plane. This
gives an equation of (1)x + (1)y + (1)z = d. Substituting the value of the point into the equation gives
d = 4, and therefore an equation of the plane is x + y + z = 4. As a quick check, since (1, 3, 0) is also on
the line, it should be on the plane; since 1 + 3 + 0 = 4, we see that this is indeed the case.
Note that had we used h−3, −3, −3i as the normal, we would have discovered the equation −3x − 3y −
3z = −12. Then we might well have noticed that we could divide both sides by −3 to get the equivalent
x + y + z = 4.
♣
We will now turn our attention to a study of lines. Unfortunately, it turns out to be quite inconvenient
to represent a typical line with a single equation; we need to approach lines in a different way.
Unlike a plane, a line in three dimensions does have an obvious direction, namely, the direction of any
vector parallel to it. In fact a line can be defined and uniquely identified by providing one point on the line
and a vector parallel to the line (in one of two possible directions). That is, the line consists of exactly
those points we can reach by starting at the point and going for some distance in the direction of the vector.
Let’s see how we can translate this into more mathematical language.
Suppose a line contains the point (v1 , v2 , v3 ) and is parallel to the vector ha, b, ci. If we place the vector
hv1 , v2 , v3 i with its tail at the origin and its head at (v1 , v2 , v3 ), and if we place the vector ha, b, ci with its
tail at (v1 , v2 , v3 ), then the head of ha, b, ci is at a point on the line. We can get to any point on the line by
doing the same thing, except using tha, b, ci in place of ha, b, ci, where t is some real number. Because of
the way vector addition works, the point at the head of the vector tha, b, ci is the point at the head of the
vector hv1 , v2 , v3 i + tha, b, ci, namely (v1 + ta, v2 + tb, v3 + tc); see Figure 12.12.

Figure 12.12: Vector form of a line.
In other words, as t runs through all possible real values, the vector hv1 , v2 , v3 i + tha, b, ci points to
every point on the line when its tail is placed at the origin. It is occasionally useful to use this form of a
line even in two dimensions; a vector form for a line in the x-y plane is hv1 , v2 i +tha, bi, which is the same
as hv1 , v2 , 0i + tha, b, 0i.
Vector Equation of a Line
An equation for a line passing through point (v1 , v2 , v3 ) and parallel to the vectorha, b, ci is
hv1 , v2 , v3 i + tha, b, ci

The vector ha, b, ci is called the direction vector for the line.

Another common way to write this is as a set of parametric equations:
x = v1 + ta

y = v2 + tb

z = v3 + tc.

Parametric Equations of a Line
A line in space can be described as
x = v1 + ta
y = v2 + tb
z = v3 + tc
where (v1 , v2 , v3 ) is a point on the line and ha, b, ci is parallel to the line.

Example 12.11: Vector Expression

Find a vector expression for the line through (6, 1, −3) and (2, 4, 5).
Solution. To get a vector parallel to the line we subtract h6, 1, −3i − h2, 4, 5i = h4, −3, −8i. The line is
then given by h2, 4, 5i + th4, −3, −8i; there are of course many other possibilities, such as h6, 1, −3i +
th4, −3, −8i.
♣
Example 12.12: Intersecting Lines

Determine whether the lines h1, 1, 1i + th1, 2, −1i and h3, 2, 1i + th−1, −5, 3i are parallel, intersect,
or neither.
Solution. In two dimensions, two lines either intersect or are parallel; in three dimensions, lines that do
not intersect might not be parallel. In this case, since the direction vectors for the lines are not parallel or
anti-parallel we know the lines are not parallel. If they intersect, there must be two values a and b so that
h1, 1, 1i + ah1, 2, −1i = h3, 2, 1i + bh−1, −5, 3i. That is, the following must have a solution:
1+a = 3−b
1 + 2a = 2 − 5b
1 − a = 1 + 3b
This gives three equations in two unknowns, so there may or may not be a solution in general. In this case,
it is easy to discover that a = 3 and b = −1 satisfies all three equations. Substituting these values into
h1, 1, 1i + ah1, 2, −1i = h3, 2, 1i + bh−1, −5, 3i, the point of intersection is (4, 7, −2).

Solution. The distance from a point P to a plane is the shortest distance from P to any point on the plane;
this is the distance measured from P perpendicular to the plane; see Figure 12.13. This distance is the
−→
absolute value of the scalar projection of QP onto a normal vector n, where Q is any point on the plane. It
is easy to find a point on the plane, say (1, 0, 1). Thus the distance is

12.6 Other Coordinate Systems
Coordinate systems are tools that let us use algebraic methods to understand geometry. While the rectangular (also called Cartesian) coordinates that we have been discussing are the most common, some
problems are easier to analyze in alternate coordinate systems.
A coordinate system is a scheme that allows us to identify any point in the plane or in three-dimensional
space by a set of numbers. In rectangular coordinates these numbers are interpreted, roughly speaking, as
the lengths of the sides of a rectangular “box.”
In two dimensions you may already be familiar with an alternative, called polar coordinates. In this
system, each point in the plane is identified by a pair of numbers (r, θ ). The number θ measures the
counter-clockwise angle between the positive x-axis and a vector with tail at the origin and head at the
point, as shown in Figure 12.15; the number r measures the distance from the origin to the point. Either
of these may be negative; a negative θ indicates the angle is measured clockwise from the positive x-axis
instead of counter-clockwise, and a negative r indicates the point at distance |r| in the opposite of the
direction given by θ .
The relationship between polar and rectangular coordinates is given by
x = r cos θ
y = r sin θ

We can extend polar coordinates to three dimensions simply by adding a z coordinate; this is called
cylindrical coordinates. Each point in three-dimensional space is represented by three coordinates
(r, θ , z) in the obvious way: this point is z units above or below
√ the point (r, θ ) in the x-y plane, as shown
in Figure 12.16. The point with rectangular coordinates (1, 3, 3) and cylindrical coordinates (2, π /3, 3)

(1, 3, 3).
Some figures with relatively complicated equations in rectangular coordinates will be represented by
simpler equations in cylindrical coordinates. For example, the cylinder in Figure 12.17 has equation
x2 + y2 = 4 in rectangular coordinates, but equation r = 2 in cylindrical coordinates.

Figure 12.17: The cylinder r = 2.
Given a point (r, θ ) in polar coordinates, it is easy to see (as in Figure 12.15) that the rectangular
coordinates of the same point are (r cos θ , r sin θ ), and so the point (r, θ , z) in cylindrical coordinates is
(r cos θ , r sin θ , z) in rectangular coordinates. This means it is usually easy to convert any equation from
rectangular to cylindrical coordinates: simply substitute
x = r cos θ
y = r sin θ
and leave z alone. For example, starting with x2 + y2 = 4 and substituting x = r cos θ , y = r sin θ gives
r2 cos2 θ + r2 sin2 θ = 4

12.6. Other Coordinate Systems

453

r2 (cos2 θ + sin2 θ ) = 4
r2 = 4
r = 2.
Of course, it’s easy to see directly that this defines a cylinder as mentioned above.
Cylindrical coordinates are an obvious extension of polar coordinates to three dimensions, but the
use of the z coordinate means they are not as closely analogous to polar coordinates as another standard
coordinate system. In polar coordinates, we identify a point by a direction and distance from the origin;
in three dimensions we can do the same thing, in a variety of ways. The question is: how do we represent
a direction? One way is to give the angle of rotation, θ , from the positive x axis, just as in cylindrical
coordinates, and also an angle of rotation, φ , from the positive z axis. Roughly speaking, θ is like longitude
and φ is like latitude. (Earth longitude is measured as a positive or negative angle from the prime meridian,
and is always between 0 and 180 degrees, east or west; θ can be any positive or negative angle, and we
use radians except in informal circumstances. Earth latitude is measured north or south from the equator;
φ is measured from the north pole down.) This system is called spherical coordinates; the coordinates
are listed in the order (ρ , θ , φ ), where ρ is the distance from the origin, and like r in polar and cylindrical
coordinates it may be negative. The general case and an example are pictured in Figure 12.18; the length
marked r is the r of cylindrical coordinates.

Figure 12.18: Spherical
coordinates: the general case and the point with rectangular coordinates
√
(1, 3, 3).
As with cylindrical coordinates, we can easily convert equations in rectangular coordinates to the
equivalent in spherical coordinates, though it is a bit more difficult to discover the proper substitutions.
Figure 12.19 shows the typical point in spherical coordinates from Figure 12.18, viewed now so that the
arrow marked r in the original graph appears as the horizontal “axis” in the left hand graph. From this
diagram it is easy to see that the z coordinate is ρ cos φ , and that r = ρ sin φ , as shown. Thus, in converting
from rectangular to spherical coordinates we will replace z by ρ cos φ . To see the substitutions for x and y
we now view the same point from above, as shown in the right hand graph. The hypotenuse of the triangle
in the right hand graph is r = ρ sin φ , so the sides of the triangle, as shown, are x = r cos θ = ρ sin φ cos θ
and y = r sin θ = ρ sin φ sin θ . Therefore to convert from rectangular to spherical coordinates, we make
these substitutions:
x = ρ sin φ cos θ
y = ρ sin φ sin θ

13.1 Functions of Several Variables
In single-variable calculus we were concerned with functions that map the real numbers R to R, sometimes
called “real functions of one variable”, meaning the “input” is a single real number and the “output” is
likewise a single real number. Now we turn to functions of several variables, where several input variables
are mapped to one value: functions f : Rn → R. We will deal primarily with n = 2 and to a lesser extent
n = 3; in fact many of the techniques we discuss can be applied to larger values of n as well.
A function f : R2 → R maps a pair of values (x, y) to a single real number. The three-dimensional
coordinate system we have already used is a convenient way to visualize such functions: above each point
(x, y) in the x-y plane we graph the point (x, y, z), where of course z = f (x, y).
Example 13.1: Plane

Describe the function f (x, y) = 3x + 4y − 5.
Solution. Writing this as z = 3x + 4y − 5 and then 3x + 4y − z = 5 we recognize the equation of a plane. In
the form f (x, y) = 3x + 4y − 5 the emphasis has shifted: we now think of x and y as independent variables
♣
and z as a variable dependent on them, but the geometry is unchanged.
Example 13.2: Sphere

Describe the equation x2 + y2 + z2 = 4.
Solution. We have seen that x2 + y2 + z2 = 4 represents a sphere of radius 2. We cannot write this in the
form f (x, y), since for each x and y in the disk x2 +y2 < 4 there are two corresponding points on
p the sphere.
2
2
As with the equation
p of a circle, we can resolve this equation into two functions, f1 (x, y) = 4 − x − y
and f2 (x, y) = − 4 − x2 − y2 , representing the upper and lower hemispheres, respectively. Each of these
is an example of a function with a restricted domain: only certain values of x and y make sense (namely,
those for which x2 + y2 ≤ 4) and the graphs of these functions are limited to a small region of the plane.
♣
Example 13.3: Square Root

Describe the function f (x, y) =

√ √
x + y.

457

458

Partial Differentiation

Solution.
This function is defined only when both x and y are non-negative. When y = 0 we get f (x, y) =
√
x, the familiar square root function in the x-z plane, and when x = 0 we get the same curve in the y-z
plane. Generally speaking, we see that starting from f (0, 0) = 0 this function gets larger in every direction
in roughly the same way that the√square root function gets larger. For example,√if we√restrict attention
√ √to
the line x = y, we get f (x, y) = 2 x and along the line y = 2x we have f (x, y) = x + 2x = (1 + 2) x.

A computer program that plots such surfaces can be very useful, as it is often difficult to get a good
idea of what they look like. Still, it is valuable to be able to visualize relatively simple surfaces without
such aids. As in the previous example, it is often a good idea to examine the function on restricted subsets
of the plane, especially lines. It can also be useful to identify those points (x, y) that share a common
z-value.
Example 13.4: Elliptic Paraboloid

Describe the graph of f (x, y) = x2 + y2 .
Solution. When x = 0 this becomes f = y2 , a parabola in the y-z plane; when y = 0 we get the “same”
parabola f = x2 in the x-z plane.
2
2
Finally, picking a value z = k, at what points
√ does f (x, y) = k? This means x + y = k, which we
recognize as the equation of a circle of radius k. So the graph of f (x, y) has parabolic cross-sections, and
the same height everywhere on concentric circles with center at the origin. This fits with what we have
already discovered.

Figure 13.2: f (x, y) = x2 + y2
As in this example, the points (x, y) such that f (x, y) = k usually form a curve, called a level curve
of the function. A graph of some level curves can give a good idea of the shape of the surface; it looks
much like a topographic map of the surface. In Figure 13.2 both the surface and its associated level curves
are shown. Note that, as with a topographic map, the heights corresponding to the level curves are evenly
spaced, so that where curves are closer together the surface is steeper.
Functions f : Rn → R behave much like functions of two variables; we will on occasion discuss functions of three variables. The principal difficulty with such functions is visualizing them, as they do not
“fit” in the three dimensions we are familiar with. For three variables there are various ways to interpret
functions that make them easier to understand. For example, f (x, y, z) could represent the temperature at
the point (x, y, z), or the pressure, or the strength of a magnetic field. It remains useful to consider those
points at which f (x, y, z) = k, where k is some constant value. If f (x, y, z) is temperature, the set of points
(x, y, z) such that f (x, y, z) = k is the collection of points in space with temperature k; in general this is
called a level set; for three variables, a level set is typically a surface, called a level surface.
Example 13.5: Level Surfaces
2

2

Suppose the temperature at (x, y, z) is T (x, y, z) = e−(x +y +z ) . This function has a maximum value
of 1 at the origin, and tends to 0 in all directions. If k is positive and at most 1, the set of points for
which T (x, y, z) = k is those points satisfying x2 + y2 + z2 = − ln k, a sphere centered at the origin.
The level surfaces are the concentric spheres centered at the origin.

13.2 Limits and Continuity
To develop calculus for functions of one variable, we needed to make sense of the concept of a limit,
which was used in the definition of a continuous function and the derivative of a function. Limits involving
functions of two variables can be considerably more difficult to deal with; fortunately, most of the functions
we encounter are fairly easy to understand.
The potential difficulty is largely due to the fact that there are many ways to “approach” a point in the
x-y plane. If we want to say that lim f (x, y) = L, we need to capture the idea that as (x, y) gets close
(x,y)→(a,b)

13.2. Limits and Continuity

461

to (a, b) then f (x, y) gets close to L. For functions of one variable, f (x), there are only two ways that x can
approach a: from the left or right. But there are an infinite number of ways to approach (a, b): along any
one of an infinite number of straight lines, or even along a curved path in the x, y-plane. We might hope
that it’s really not so bad—suppose, for example, that along every possible line through (a, b) the value of
f (x, y) gets close to L; surely this means that “ f (x, y) approaches L as (x, y) approaches (a, b)”. Sadly, no.

Figure 13.3: f (x, y) =

xy2
x2 + y4

Example 13.6: Weird Limit

Analyze f (x, y) = xy2 /(x2 + y4 ).
Solution. When x = 0 or y = 0, f (x, y) is 0, so the limit of f (x, y) approaching the origin along either
the x or y axis is 0. Moreover, along the line y = mx, f (x, y) = m2 x3 /(x2 + m4 x4 ). As x approaches 0
this expression approaches 0 as well. So along every line through the origin f (x, y) approaches 0. Now
suppose we approach the origin along x = y2 . Then
f (x, y) =

y2 y2

Partial Differentiation

so the limit is 1/2. Looking at Figure 13.3, it is apparent that there is a ridge above x = y2 . Approaching
the origin along a straight line, we go over the ridge and then drop down toward 0, but approaching along
the ridge the height is a constant 1/2.
♣
Fortunately, we can define the concept of limit without needing to specify how a particular point is
approached—indeed, in Definition 3.3, we didn’t need the concept of “approach.” Roughly, that definition
says that when x is close to a then f (x) is close to L; there is no mention of “how” we get close to a. We
can adapt that definition to two variables quite easily:
Definition 13.7: Limit of a Multivariate Function

Suppose f (x, y) is a function. We say that
lim

(x,y)→(a,b)

f (x, y) = L

if for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 so that whenever 0 <

p

(x − a)2 + (y − b)2 < δ , | f (x, y) − L| < ε.

This says that we can make | f (x, y) − L| < ε , no matter how small ε is, by making the distance from
(x, y) to (a, b) “small enough”.
Example 13.8: Multivariate Limit

Show that

3x2 y
= 0.
(x,y)→(0,0) x2 + y2

Solution. Suppose ε > 0. Then

3x2 y

Note that x2 /(x2 + y2 ) ≤ 1 and |y| = y2 ≤ x2 + y2 < δ . So
x2
3|y| < 1 · 3 · δ .
x2 + y2

We want to force this to be less than ε by picking δ “small enough.” If we choose δ = ε /3 then
3x2 y
ε
< 1 · 3 · = ε.

♣
Recall that a function f (x) is continuous at x = a if lim f (x) = f (a). We can say exactly the same
x→a

thing about a function of two variables: f (x, y) is continuous at (a, b) if

lim

(x,y)→(a,b)

f (x, y) = f (a, b).

The function f (x, y) = 3x2 y/(x2 + y2 ) is not continuous at (0, 0), because f (0, 0) is not defined. However, we know that lim f (x, y) = 0, so we can make a continuous function, by extending the definition
(x,y)→(0,0)

of f so that f (0, 0) = 0. This surface is shown in Figure 13.4.

Note that we cannot extend the definition of the function in Example 13.6 to create a continuous
function, since the limit does not exist as we approach (0, 0).
Fortunately, the functions we will be working with will usually be continuous almost everywhere.
As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are particularly useful and easy to
describe. A polynomial in two variables is a sum of terms of the form axm yn , where a is a real number and
m and n are non-negative integers. A rational function is a quotient of polynomials.
Theorem 13.9: Continuity of Functions

Polynomials are continuous everywhere. Rational functions are continuous everywhere they are
defined.

13.3 Partial Differentiation
The derivative of a function of a single variable tells us how quickly the value of the function changes as
the value of the independent variable changes. Intuitively, it tells us how “steep” the graph of the function
is. We might wonder if there is a similar idea for graphs of functions of two variables, that is, surfaces. It
is not clear that this has a simple answer, nor how we might proceed. We will start with what seem to be
very small steps toward the goal. Surprisingly, it turns out that these simple ideas hold the keys to a more
general understanding.

Figure 13.5: The intersection of a plane x + y = 1 and the surface f (x, y) = x2 + y2
The derivative of a single-variable function f (x) tells us how much f (x) changes as x increases. The
obvious analogue for a function of two variables g(x, y) would be something that tells us how quickly
g(x, y) increases as x and y increase. However, in most cases this will depend on how quickly x and y are
changing relative to each other.
Example 13.10:

Analyze f (x, y) = y2 .
Solution. If we look at a point (x, y, y2 ) on this surface, the value of a function does not change at all if we
fix y and let x increase, but increases like y2 if we fix x and let y increase.
♣
Now let us consider what happens to f (x, y) when both x and y are increasing, perhaps at different
rates. We can think of this as being a movement in a certain direction of a point in the x, y-plane. A point
and a direction defines a line in the x, y-plane, and so we are asking how the function changes as we move
along this line.
Let us then imagine a plane perpendicular to the x, y-plane that intersects the the x, y-plane along this
line. This plane will intersect the surface of f in a curve, so we can just look at the behaviour of this curve
in the given plane.
Figure 13.5 shows the plane x + y = 1, which is the plane perpendicular to the line x + y = 1 in the
x, y-plane. Observe that its intersection with the surface of f is a curve, in fact, a parabola. We will refer
to such a curve as the cross-section of the surface above the line in the x, y-plane.
We can now look at the rate of change (or slope) of f in a particular direction by looking at the slope
of a curve in a plane — something we already have experience with.
Let’s start by looking at some particularly easy lines: Those parallel to the x or y axis. Suppose we
are interested in the cross-section of f (x, y) above the line y = b. If we substitute b for y in f (x, y), we get
a function in one variable, describing the height of the cross-section as a function of x. Because y = b is

466

Partial Differentiation

parallel to the x-axis, if we view it from a vantage point on the negative y-axis, we will see what appears
to be simply an ordinary curve in the x-z plane.

Figure 13.6: f (x, y) = x2 + y2 , cut by the plane y = 2
Consider again the parabolic surface f (x, y) = x2 + y2 . The cross-section above the line y = 2 consists
of all points (x, 2, x2 + 4). Looking at this cross-section we see what appears to be just the curve f (x) =
x2 + 4. At any point on the cross-section, (a, 2, a2 + 4), the slope of the surface in the direction of the line
y = 2 is simply the slope of the curve f (x) = x2 + 4, namely 2x. Figure 13.6 shows the same parabolic
surface as before, but now cut by the plane y = 2. The left graph shows the cut-off surface, the right shows
just the cross-section.
If, for example, we’re interested in the point (−1, 2, 5) on the surface, then the slope in the direction
of the line y = 2 is 2x = 2(−1) = −2. This means that starting at (−1, 2, 5) and moving on the surface,
above the line y = 2, in the direction of increasing x values, the surface goes down; of course moving in
the opposite direction, toward decreasing x values, the surface will rise.
If we’re interested in some other line y = k, there is really no change in the computation. The equation
of the cross-section above y = k is x2 + k2 with derivative 2x. We can save ourselves the effort, small as it
is, of substituting k for y: all we are in effect doing is temporarily assuming that y is some constant. With
d
this assumption, the derivative dx
(x2 + y2 ) = 2x. To emphasize that we are only temporarily assuming
y is constant, we use a slightly different notation: ∂∂x (x2 + y2 ) = 2x; the “∂ ” reminds us that there are
more variables than x, but that only x is being treated as a variable. We read the equation as “the partial
derivative of (x2 + y2 ) with respect to x is 2x.” A convenient alternate notation for the partial derivative of
f (x, y) with respect to x is is fx (x, y).
Example 13.11: Partial Derivative with respect to x

Find the partial derivative with respect to x of x3 + 3xy.
Solution. The partial derivative with respect to x of x3 + 3xy is 3x2 + 3y. Note that the partial derivative

13.3. Partial Differentiation

467

includes the variable y, unlike the example x2 + y2 . It is somewhat unusual for the partial derivative to
depend on a single variable; this example is more typical.
♣
Of course, we can do the same sort of calculation for lines parallel to the y-axis. We temporarily hold
x constant, which gives us the equation of the cross-section above a line x = k. We can then compute the
derivative with respect to y; this will measure the slope of the curve in the y direction.
Example 13.12: Partial Derivative with respect to y

Find the partial derivative with respect to y of f (x, y) = sin(xy) + 3xy.
Solution. The partial derivative with respect to y of f (x, y) = sin(xy) + 3xy is
fy (x, y) =

∂
∂
sin(xy) + 3xy = cos(xy) (xy) + 3x = x cos(xy) + 3x.

♣

So far, using no new techniques, we have succeeded in measuring the slope of a surface in two quite
special directions. For functions of one variable, the derivative is closely linked to the notion of tangent
line. For surfaces, the analogous idea is the tangent plane—a plane that just touches a surface at a point,
and has the same slope as the surface in all directions. Even though we haven’t yet figured out how to
compute the slope in all directions, we have enough information to find tangent planes. Suppose we want
the plane tangent to a surface at a particular point (a, b, c). If we compute the two partial derivatives of
the function for that point, we get enough information to determine two lines tangent to the surface, both
through (a, b, c) and both tangent to the surface in their respective directions. These two lines determine
a plane, that is, there is exactly one plane containing the two lines: the tangent plane. Figure 13.7 shows
(part of) two tangent lines at a point, and the tangent plane containing them.

Figure 13.7: Tangent vectors and tangent plane.
How can we discover an equation for this tangent plane? We know a point on the plane, (a, b, c); we
need a vector normal to the plane. If we can find two vectors, one parallel to each of the tangent lines we
know how to find, then the cross product of these vectors will give the desired normal vector.

Figure 13.8: A tangent vector.
How can we find vectors parallel to the tangent lines? Consider first the line tangent to the surface
above the line y = b. A vector hu, v, wi parallel to this tangent line must have y component v = 0, and we
may as well take the x component to be u = 1. The ratio of the z component to the x component is the slope
of the tangent line, precisely what we know how to compute. The slope of the tangent line is fx (a, b), so
fx (a, b) =

w w
= = w.
u
1

In other words, a vector parallel to this tangent line is h1, 0, fx (a, b)i, as shown in Figure 13.8. If we repeat
the reasoning for the tangent line above x = a, we get the vector h0, 1, fy(a, b)i.
Now to find the desired normal vector we compute the cross product, h0, 1, fyi×h1, 0, fx i = h fx , fy , −1i.
From our earlier discussion of planes, we can write down the equation we seek: fx (a, b)x + fy (a, b)y − z =
k, and k as usual can be computed by substituting a known point: fx (a, b)(a) + fy (a, b)(b) − c = k. There
are various more-or-less nice ways to write the result:
fx (a, b)x + fy (a, b)y − z = fx (a, b)a + fy (a, b)b − c
fx (a, b)x + fy (a, b)y − fx (a, b)a − fy(a, b)b + c = z
fx (a, b)(x − a) + fy(a, b)(y − b) + c = z
fx (a, b)(x − a) + fy(a, b)(y − b) + f (a, b) = z

So it appears that to find a tangent plane, we need only find two quite simple ordinary derivatives,
namely fx and fy . This is true if the tangent plane exists. It is, unfortunately, not always the case that if
fx and fy exist there is a tangent plane. Consider the function xy2 /(x2 + y4 ) with f (0, 0) defined to be 0,
pictured in Figure 13.3. This function has value 0 when x = 0 or y = 0. Now it’s clear that fx (0, 0) =
fy (0, 0) = 0, because in the x and y directions the surface is simply a horizontal line. But it’s also clear
from the picture that this surface does not have anything that deserves to be called a tangent plane at the
origin, certainly not the x-y plane containing these two tangent lines.
When does a surface have a tangent plane at a particular point? What we really want from a tangent
plane, as from a tangent line, is that the plane be a “good” approximation of the surface near the point.
Here is how we can make this precise:
Definition 13.14: Tangent Plane

Let ∆x = x − x0 , ∆y = y − y0 , and ∆z = z − z0 where z0 = f (x0 , y0 ). The function z = f (x, y) is
differentiable at (x0 , y0 ) if
∆z = fx (x0 , y0 )∆x + fy (x0 , y0 )∆y + ε1 ∆x + ε2 ∆y,

where both ε1 and ε2 approach 0 as (x, y) approaches (x0 , y0 ).
This definition takes a bit of absorbing. Let’s rewrite the central equation a bit:
z = fx (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + fy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ) + f (x0 , y0 ) + ε1 ∆x + ε2 ∆y.

(13.1)

The first three terms on the right are the equation of the tangent plane, that is,
fx (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + fy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ) + f (x0 , y0 )
is the z-value of the point on the plane above (x, y). Equation 13.1 says that the z-value of a point on the
surface is equal to the z-value of a point on the plane plus a “little bit,” namely ε1 ∆x + ε2 ∆y. As (x, y)
approaches (x0 , y0 ), both ∆x and ∆y approach 0, so this little bit ε1 ∆x + ε2 ∆y also approaches 0, and the
z-values on the surface and the plane get close to each other. But that by itself is not very interesting:
since the surface and the plane both contain the point (x0 , y0 , z0 ), the z values will approach z0 and hence
get close to each other whether the tangent plane is “tangent” to the surface or not. The extra condition in
the definition says that as (x, y) approaches (x0 , y0 ), the ε values approach 0—this means that ε1 ∆x + ε2 ∆y
approaches 0 much, much faster, because ε1 ∆x is much smaller than either ε1 or ∆x. It is this extra
condition that makes the plane a tangent plane.
We can see that the extra condition on ε1 and ε2 is just what is needed if we look at partial derivatives.
Suppose we temporarily fix y = y0 , so ∆y = 0. Then the equation from the definition becomes
∆z = fx (x0 , y0 )∆x + ε1 ∆x
or

∆z
= fx (x0 , y0 ) + ε1 .
∆x
Now taking the limit of the two sides as ∆x approaches 0, the left side turns into the partial derivative of z
with respect to x at (x0 , y0 ), or in other words fx (x0 , y0 ), and the right side does the same, because as (x, y)
approaches (x0 , y0 ), ε1 approaches 0. Essentially the same calculation works for fy .

Exercise 13.3.17 Suppose that one of your colleagues has calculated the partial derivatives of a given

(a) z = f (x)g(y)
(b) z = f (xy)
(c) z = f (x/y)

13.4 The Chain Rule
Consider the surface z = x2 y + xy2 , and suppose that x = 2 + t 4 and y = 1 − t 3. We can think of the latter
two equations as describing how x and y change relative to, say, time. Then
z = x2 y + xy2 = (2 + t 4)2 (1 − t 3) + (2 + t 4)(1 − t 3)2
tells us explicitly how the z coordinate of the corresponding point on the surface depends on t. If we want
to know dz/dt we can compute it more or less directly, but it’s actually a bit simpler to use product and
chain rules:
dz
= x2 y′ + 2xx′ y + x2yy′ + x′ y2
dt
= (2xy + y2 )x′ + (x2 + 2xy)y′
= (2(2 + t 4)(1 − t 3) + (1 − t 3)2 )(4t 3) + ((2 + t 4)2 + 2(2 + t 4)(1 − t 3))(−3t 2)
If we look carefully at the middle step, dz/dt = (2xy + y2 )x′ + (x2 + 2xy)y′ , we notice that 2xy + y2 is
∂ z/∂ x, and x2 + 2xy is ∂ z/∂ y. This turns out to be true in general, and gives us a new chain rule:
Theorem 13.15: Multivariate Chain Rule

Suppose that z = f (x, y), f is differentiable, x = g(t), and y = h(t). Assuming that the relevant
derivatives exist,
dz ∂ z dx ∂ z dy

as desired.
We can write the chain rule in a way that is somewhat closer to the single variable chain rule:
df
= h fx , fy i · hx′, y′ i,
dt

or (roughly) the derivatives of the outside function “times” the derivatives of the inside functions. Not
surprisingly, essentially the same chain rule works for functions of more than two variables, for example,
given a function of three variables f (x, y, z), where each of x, y and z is a function of t,
df
= h fx , fy , fz i · hx′ , y′ , z′ i.
dt
We can even extend the idea further. Suppose that f (x, y) is a function and x = g(s,t) and y = h(s,t)
are functions of two variables s and t. Then f is “really” a function of s and t as well, and

∂f
= f x gs + f y hs
∂s

∂f
= fx gt + fy ht .
∂t

The natural extension of this to f (x, y, z) works as well.
Recall that we used the ordinary chain rule to do implicit differentiation. We can do the same with the
new chain rule.
Example 13.16: Equation of a Sphere

Find the partial derivative of x2 + y2 + z2 = 4.
Solution. The equation x2 + y2 + z2 = 4 defines a sphere, which is not a function of x and y, though it can
be thought of as two functions, the top and bottom hemispheres. We can think of z as one of these two

13.4. The Chain Rule

functions, so really z = z(x, y), and we can think of x and y as particularly simple functions of x and y, and
let f (x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2 . Since f (x, y, z) = 4, ∂ f /∂ x = 0, but using the chain rule:

13.5 Directional Derivatives
We still have not answered one of our first questions about the steepness of a surface: starting at a point
on a surface given by f (x, y), and walking in a particular direction, how steep is the surface? We are now
ready to answer the question.
We already know roughly what has to be done: as shown in Figure 13.5, we extend a line in the x-y
plane to a vertical plane, and we then compute the slope of the curve that is the cross-section of the surface
in that plane. The major stumbling block is that what appears in this plane to be the horizontal axis, namely
the line in the x-y plane, is not an actual axis—we know nothing about the “units” along the axis. Our goal
is to make this line into a t axis; then we need formulas to write x and y in terms of this new variable t;
then we can write z in terms of t since we know z in terms of x and y; and finally we can simply take the
derivative.
So we need to somehow “mark off” units on the line, and we need a convenient way to refer to the
line in calculations. It turns out that we can accomplish both by using the vector form of a line. Suppose
that u is a unit vector hu1 , u2 i in the direction of interest. A vector equation for the line through (x0 , y0 ) in
this direction is v(t) = hu1t + x0 , u2t + y0 i. The height of the surface above the point (u1t + x0 , u2t + y0 ) is
g(t) = f (u1t + x0 , u2t + y0 ). Because u is a unit vector, the value of t is precisely the distance along the
line from (x0 , y0 ) to (u1t + x0 , u2t + y0 ); this means that the line is effectively a t axis, with origin at the
point (x0 , y0 ), so the slope we seek is
g′ (0) = h fx (x0 , y0 ), fy (x0 , y0 )i · hu1, u2 i
= h fx , fy i · u
= ∇f ·u
Here we have used the chain rule and the derivatives dtd (u1t + x0 ) = u1 and dtd (u2t + y0 ) = u2 . The vector
h fx , fy i is very useful, so it has its own symbol, ∇ f , pronounced “del f”; it is also called the gradient of f .

Example 13.17: Slope

Find the slope of z = x2 + y2 at (1, 2) in the direction of the vector h3, 4i.
Solution. We first compute the gradient at (1, 2): ∇ f = h2x, 2yi, which is h2, 4i at (1, 2). A unit vector in
the desired direction is h3/5, 4/5i, and the desired slope is then h2, 4i · h3/5, 4/5i = 6/5 + 16/5 = 22/5.
♣
Example 13.18: Tangent Vector

Find a tangent vector to z = x2 + y2 at (1, 2) in the direction of the vector h3, 4i and show that it is
parallel to the tangent plane at that point.
Solution. Since h3/5, 4/5i is a unit vector in the desired direction, we can easily expand it to a tangent
vector simply by adding the third coordinate computed in the previous example: h3/5, 4/5, 22/5i. To see
that this vector is parallel to the tangent plane, we can compute its dot product with a normal to the plane.
We know that a normal to the tangent plane is
h fx (1, 2), fy (1, 2), −1i = h2, 4, −1i,
and the dot product is h2, 4, −1i · h3/5, 4/5, 22/5i = 6/5 + 16/5 − 22/5 = 0, so the two vectors are perpendicular. (Note that the vector normal to the surface, namely h fx , fy , −1i, is simply the gradient with a
−1 tacked on as the third component.)
♣
The slope of a surface given by z = f (x, y) in the direction of a (two-dimensional) vector u is called the
directional derivative of f , written Du f . The directional derivative immediately provides us with some
additional information. We know that
Du f = ∇ f · u = |∇ f ||u| cos θ = |∇ f | cos θ
if u is a unit vector; θ is the angle between ∇ f and u. This tells us immediately that the largest value of
Du f occurs when cos θ = 1, namely, when θ = 0, so ∇ f is parallel to u. In other words, the gradient ∇ f
points in the direction of steepest ascent of the surface, and |∇ f | is the slope in that direction. Likewise,
the smallest value of Du f occurs when cos θ = −1, namely, when θ = π , so ∇ f is anti-parallel to u. In
other words, −∇ f points in the direction of steepest descent of the surface, and −|∇ f | is the slope in that
direction.
Example 13.19: Direction of Steepest Ascent and Descent

Investigate the direction of steepest ascent and descent for z = x2 + y2 .
Solution. The gradient is h2x, 2yi = 2hx, yi; this is a vector parallel to the vector hx, yi, so the direction
of steepest ascent is directly away from the origin, starting at the point (x, y). The direction of steepest
descent is thus directly toward the origin from (x, y). Note that at (0, 0) the gradient vector is h0, 0i, which
has no direction, and it is clear from the plot of this surface that there is a minimum point at the origin,
and tangent vectors in all directions are parallel to the x-y plane.
♣

476

Partial Differentiation

If ∇ f is perpendicular to u, Du f = |∇ f | cos(π /2) = 0, since cos(π /2) = 0. This means that in either
of the two directions perpendicular to ∇ f , the slope of the surface is 0; this implies that a vector in either
of these directions is tangent to the level curve at that point. Starting with ∇ f = h fx , fy i, it is easy to find
a vector perpendicular to it: either h fy , − fx i or h− fy , fx i will work.
If f (x, y, z) is a function of three variables, all the calculations proceed in essentially the same way. The
rate at which f changes in a particular direction is ∇ f · u, where now ∇ f = h fx , fy , fz i and u = hu1 , u2 , u3 i is
a unit vector. Again ∇ f points in the direction of maximum rate of increase, −∇ f points in the direction of
maximum rate of decrease, and any vector perpendicular to ∇ f is tangent to the level surface f (x, y, z) = k
at the point in question. Of course there are no longer just two such vectors; the vectors perpendicular to
∇ f describe the tangent plane to the level surface, or in other words ∇ f is a normal to the tangent plane.
Example 13.20: Gradient

Suppose the temperature at a point in space is given by T (x, y, z) = T0 /(1 + x2 + y2 + z2 ); at the
origin the temperature in Kelvin is T0 > 0, and it decreases in every direction from there. It might
be, for example, that there is a source of heat at the origin, and as we get farther from the source,
the temperature decreases. The gradient is

The gradient points directly at the origin from the point (x, y, z)—by moving directly toward the
heat source, we increase the temperature as quickly as possible.

Example 13.21: Tangent Plane

Find the points on the surface defined by x2 + 2y2 + 3z2 = 1 where the tangent plane is parallel to
the plane defined by 3x − y + 3z = 1.
Solution. Two planes are parallel if their normals are parallel or anti-parallel, so we want to find the points
on the surface with normal parallel or anti-parallel to h3, −1, 3i. Let f = x2 + 2y2 + 3z2 ; the gradient of
f is normal to the level surface at every point, so we are looking for a gradient parallel or anti-parallel to
h3, −1, 3i. The gradient is h2x, 4y, 6zi; if it is parallel or anti-parallel to h3, −1, 3i, then
h2x, 4y, 6zi = kh3, −1, 3i
for some k. This means we need a solution to the equations
2x = 3k

4y = −k

6z = 3k

but this is three equations in four unknowns—we need another equation. What we haven’t used so far is
that the points we seek are on the surface x2 + 2y2 + 3z2 = 1; this is the fourth equation. If we solve the

13.6 Higher Order Derivatives
In single variable calculus we saw that the second derivative is often useful: in appropriate circumstances
it measures acceleration; it can be used to identify maximum and minimum points; it tells us something
about how sharply curved a graph is. Not surprisingly, second derivatives are also useful in the multivariable case, but again not surprisingly, things are a bit more complicated.
It’s easy to see where some complication is going to come from: with two variables there are four
possible second derivatives. To take a “derivative,” we must take a partial derivative with respect to x or y,
and there are four ways to do it: x then x, x then y, y then x, y then y.
Example 13.22: Second Derivatives

Compute all four second derivatives of f (x, y) = x2 y2 .
Solution. Using an obvious notation, we get:
fxx = 2y2

fxy = 4xy

fyx = 4xy

fyy = 2x2 .
♣

You will have noticed that two of these are the same, the “mixed partials” computed by taking partial
derivatives with respect to both variables in the two possible orders. This is not an accident—as long as
the function is reasonably nice, this will always be true.
Theorem 13.23: Clairaut’s Theorem

If the mixed partial derivatives are continuous, they are equal.

Example 13.24: Mixed Partials

Compute the mixed partials of f = xy/(x2 + y2 ).
Solution. The mixed partial fxy is found by first taking the partial derivative with respect to x:
fx =

y3 − x2 y

13.7 Maxima and Minima
Suppose a surface given by f (x, y) has a local maximum at (x0 , y0 , z0 ); geometrically, this point on the
surface looks like the top of a hill. If we look at the cross-section in the plane y = y0 , we will see a local
maximum on the curve at (x0 , z0 ), and we know from single-variable calculus that ∂∂ xz = 0 at this point.
Likewise, in the plane x = x0 , ∂∂ yz = 0. So if there is a local maximum at (x0 , y0 , z0 ), both partial derivatives
at the point must be zero, and likewise for a local minimum. Thus, to find local maximum and minimum
points, we need only consider those points at which both partial derivatives are 0. As in the single-variable

13.7. Maxima and Minima

481

case, it is possible for the derivatives to be 0 at a point that is neither a maximum or a minimum, so we
need to test these points further.
You will recall that in the single variable case, we examined three methods to identify maximum
and minimum points; the most useful is the second derivative test, though it does not always work. For
functions of two variables there is also a second derivative test; again it is by far the most useful test,
though it doesn’t always work.
Theorem 13.25: Extrema Test for Multivariate Functions

Suppose that the second partial derivatives of f (x, y) are continuous near (x0 , y0 ), and fx (x0 , y0 ) =
fy (x0 , y0 ) = 0. We denote by D the discriminant D(x0 , y0 ) = fxx (x0 , y0 ) fyy (x0 , y0 ) − fxy (x0 , y0 )2 . If
D > 0 and fxx (x0 , y0 ) < 0 there is a local maximum at (x0 , y0 ); if D > 0 and fxx (x0 , y0 ) > 0 there is a
local minimum at (x0 , y0 ); if D < 0 there is neither a maximum nor a minimum at (x0 , y0 ); if D = 0,
the test fails.

Example 13.26: Extrema on an Elliptic Paraboloid

Verify that f (x, y) = x2 + y2 has a minimum at (0, 0).
Solution. First, we compute all the needed derivatives:
fx = 2x

fy = 2y

fxx = 2

fyy = 2

fxy = 0.

The derivatives fx and fy are zero only at (0, 0). Applying the second derivative test there:
D(0, 0) = fxx (0, 0) fyy (0, 0) − fxy (0, 0)2 = 2 · 2 − 0 = 4 > 0,
so there is a local minimum at (0, 0), and there are no other possibilities.

♣

Example 13.27: Extrema on a Hyperbolic Paraboloid

Find all local maxima and minima for f (x, y) = x2 − y2 .
Solution. The derivatives:
fx = 2x

fy = −2y

fxx = 2

fyy = −2

fxy = 0.

Again there is a single critical point, at (0, 0), and
D(0, 0) = fxx (0, 0) fyy(0, 0) − fxy (0, 0)2 = 2 · −2 − 0 = −4 < 0,
so there is neither a maximum nor minimum there, and so there are no local maxima or minima. The
surface is shown in Figure 13.9.

Solution. The derivatives:
fx = 4x3

fy = 4y3

fxx = 12x2

fyy = 12y2

fxy = 0.

Again there is a single critical point, at (0, 0), and
D(0, 0) = fxx (0, 0) fyy(0, 0) − fxy (0, 0)2 = 0 · 0 − 0 = 0,
so we get no information. However, in this case it is easy to see that there is a minimum at (0, 0), because
f (0, 0) = 0 and at all other points f (x, y) > 0.
♣
Example 13.29: Finding Extrema

Find all local maxima and minima for f (x, y) = x3 + y3 .
Solution. The derivatives:
fx = 3x2

fy = 3y2

fxx = 6x2

fyy = 6y2

fxy = 0.

Again there is a single critical point, at (0, 0), and
D(0, 0) = fxx (0, 0) fyy(0, 0) − fxy (0, 0)2 = 0 · 0 − 0 = 0,

13.7. Maxima and Minima

483

so we get no information. In this case, a little thought shows there is neither a maximum nor a minimum
at (0, 0): when x and y are both positive, f (x, y) > 0, and when x and y are both negative, f (x, y) < 0, and
there are points of both kinds arbitrarily close to (0, 0). Alternately, if we look at the cross-section when
y = 0, we get f (x, 0) = x3 , which does not have either a maximum or minimum at x = 0.

Example 13.30: Optimizing Dimensions of a Box

Suppose a box with no top is to hold a certain volume V . Find the dimensions for the box that result
in the minimum surface area.
Solution. The area of the box is A = 2hw + 2hl + lw, and the volume is V = lwh, so we can write the area
as a function of two variables,
2V 2V
A(l, w) =
+
+ lw.
l
w
Then
2V
2V
Al = − 2 + w and Aw = − 2 + l.
l
w
If we set these equal to zero and solve, we find w = (2V )1/3 and l = (2V )1/3 , and the corresponding height
is h = V /(2V )2/3 .
The second derivatives are
All =

4V
l3

Aww =

4V
w3

Alw = 1,

so the discriminant is

4V 4V
− 1 = 4 − 1 = 3 > 0.
l 3 w3
Since All is 2, there is a local minimum at the critical point. Is this a global minimum? It is, but it is
difficult to see this analytically; physically and graphically it is clear that there is a minimum, in which
case it must be at the single critical point.
♣
D=

Recall that when we did single variable global maximum and minimum problems, the easiest cases
were those for which the variable could be limited to a finite closed interval, for then we simply had to
check all critical values and the endpoints. The previous example is difficult because there is no finite
boundary to the domain of the problem—both w and l can be in (0, ∞). As in the single variable case, the
problem is often simpler when there is a finite boundary.
Theorem 13.31: Multivariate Absolute Extrema

If f (x, y) is continuous on a closed and bounded subset of R2 , then it has both a maximum and
minimum value.
As in the case of single variable functions, this means that the maximum and minimum values must
occur at a critical point or on the boundary; in the two variable case, however, the boundary is a curve, not
merely two endpoints.

Example 13.32: Optimizing Volume of a Box

The length of the diagonal of a box is to be 1 meter; find the maximum possible volume.

diagonal is x2 + y2 + z2 , and the volume is

13.8 Lagrange Multipliers
Many applied max/min problems take the following
p form: we want to find an extreme value of a function,
like V = xyz, subject to a constraint, like 1 = x2 + y2 + z2 . Often this can be done, as we have, by
explicitly combining the equations and then finding critical points. There is another approach that is often
convenient, the method of Lagrange multipliers.
It is somewhat easier to understand two variable problems, so we begin with one as an example.
Suppose the perimeter of a rectangle is to be 100 units. Find the rectangle with largest area. This is a
fairly straightforward problem from single variable calculus. We write down the two equations: A = xy,
P = 100 = 2x + 2y, solve the second of these for y (or x), substitute into the first, and end up with a onevariable maximization problem. Let’s now think of it differently: the equation A = xy defines a surface,
and the equation 100 = 2x + 2y defines a curve (a line, in this case) in the x-y plane. If we graph both of
these in the three-dimensional coordinate system, we can phrase the problem like this: what is the highest
point on the surface above the line? The solution we already understand effectively produces the equation
of the cross-section of the surface above the line and then treats it as a single variable problem. Instead,
imagine that we draw the level curves (the contour lines) for the surface in the x-y plane, along with the
line.

Figure 13.11: Constraint line with contour plot of the surface xy.
Imagine that the line represents a hiking trail and the contour lines are, as on a topographic map, the
lines of constant altitude. How could you estimate, based on the graph, the high (or low) points on the
path? As the path crosses contour lines, you know the path must be increasing or decreasing in elevation.
At some point you will see the path just touch a contour line (tangent to it), and then begin to cross contours
in the opposite order—that point of tangency must be a maximum or minimum point. If we can identify
all such points, we can then check them to see which gives the maximum and which the minimum value.
As usual, we also need to check boundary points; in this problem, we know that x and y are positive, so
we are interested in just the portion of the line in the first quadrant, as shown. The endpoints of the path,
the two points on the axes, are not points of tangency, but they are the two places that the function xy is a
minimum in the first quadrant.
How can we actually make use of this? At the points of tangency that we seek, the constraint curve
(in this case the line) and the level curve have the same slope—their tangent lines are parallel. This also
means that the constraint curve is perpendicular to the gradient vector of the function; going a bit further,
if we can express the constraint curve itself as a level curve, then we seek the points at which the two level
curves have parallel gradients. The curve 100 = 2x + 2y can be thought of as a level curve of the function
2x + 2y; Figure 13.12 shows both sets of level curves on a single graph. We are interested in those points
where two level curves are tangent—but there are many such points, in fact an infinite number, as we’ve
only shown a few of the level curves. All along the line y = x are points at which two level curves are
tangent. While this might seem to be a show-stopper, it is not.

Figure 13.12: Contour plots for 2x + 2y and xy.
The gradient of 2x + 2y is h2, 2i, and the gradient of xy is hy, xi. They are parallel when h2, 2i = λ hy, xi,
that is, when 2 = λ y and 2 = λ x. We have two equations in three unknowns, which typically results in
many solutions (as we expected). A third equation will reduce the number of solutions; the third equation
is the original constraint, 100 = 2x + 2y. So we have the following system to solve:
2 = λy

2 = λx

100 = 2x + 2y.

In the first two equations, λ can’t be 0, so we may divide by it to get x = y = 2/λ . Substituting into the
third equation we get

+ 2 = 100

so x = y = 25. Note that we are not really interested in the value of λ —it is a clever tool, the Lagrange
multiplier, introduced to solve the problem. In many cases, as here, it is easier to find λ than to find
everything else without using λ .
The same method works for functions of three variables, except of course everything is one dimension higher: the function to be optimized is a function of three variables and the constraint represents a
surface—for example, the function may represent temperature, and we may be interested in the maximum
temperature on some surface, like a sphere. The points we seek are those at which the constraint surface
is tangent to a level surface of the function. Once again, we consider the constraint surface to be a level
surface of some function, and we look for points at which the two gradients are parallel, giving us three
equations in four unknowns. The constraint provides a fourth equation.
Example 13.33: Optimization with Constraints

Maximize the function xyz given the constraint 1 =

p

x2 + y2 + z2 .

13.8. Lagrange Multipliers

489

p
Solution. The constraint is 1 = x2 + y2 + z2 , which is the same as 1 = x2 + y2 + z2 . The function to
maximize is xyz. The two gradient vectors are h2x, 2y, 2zi and hyz, xz, xyi, so the equations to be solved are
yz = 2xλ
xz = 2yλ
xy = 2zλ
1 = x2 + y2 + z2

If λ = 0 then at least two of x, y, z must be 0, giving a volume of 0, which will not be the maximum. If we
multiply the first two equations by x and y respectively, we get
xyz = 2x2 λ
xyz = 2y2 λ

2 ; in the same way we can show x2 = z2 . Hence the fourth equation becomes
so 2x2 λ = 2y2 λ or x2 = y√
√
1 = x2 + x2 + x2 or x = 1/ 3, and so x = y = z = 1/ 3 gives the maximum volume. This is of course the
same answer we obtained previously.
♣

Another possibility is that we have a function of three variables, and we want to find a maximum or
minimum value not on a surface but on a curve; often the curve is the intersection of two surfaces, so that
we really have two constraint equations, say g(x, y, z) = c1 and h(x, y, z) = c2 . It turns out that at points on
the intersection of the surfaces where f has a maximum or minimum value,
∇ f = λ ∇g + µ ∇h.
As before, this gives us three equations, one for each component of the vectors, but now in five unknowns,
x, y, z, λ , and µ . Since there are two constraint functions, we have a total of five equations in five
unknowns, and so can usually find the solutions we need.
Example 13.34: Intersection of a Plane with a Cylinder

The plane x + y − z = 1 intersects the cylinder x2 + y2 = 1 in an ellipse. Find the points on the ellipse
closest to and farthest from the origin.

Solution. We want the extreme values of f = x2 + y2 + z2 subject to the constraints g = x2 + y2 = 1 and
2
2
2
h = x + y − z = 1. To simplify the algebra, we may
puse instead f = x + y + z , since this has a maximum
or minimum value at exactly the points at which x2 + y2 + z2 does. The gradients are
∇ f = h2x, 2y, 2zi

∇g = h2x, 2y, 0i

so the equations we need to solve are
2x = λ 2x + µ
2y = λ 2y + µ

∇h = h1, 1, −1i,

2z = 0 − µ

1 = x2 + y2
1 = x + y − z.

Subtracting the first two we get 2y − 2x = λ (2y − 2x), so either λ = 1 or x = y. If λ = 1 then µ = 0, so
z = 0 and the last two equations are
1 = x2 + y2

and

1 = x + y.

Solving these gives x = 1, y = 0, or x = 0, y = 1, so the points of interest are (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0),

14.1 Volume and Average Height
Consider a surface f (x, y); you might temporarily think of this as representing physical topography—a
hilly landscape, perhaps. What is the average height of the surface (or average altitude of the landscape)
over some region?
As with most such problems, we start by thinking about how we might approximate the answer. Suppose the region is a rectangle, [a, b] × [c, d]. We can divide the rectangle into a grid, m subdivisions in
one direction and n in the other, as indicated in Figure 14.1. We pick x values x0 , x1 ,. . . , xm−1 in each
subdivision in the x direction, and similarly in the y direction. At each of the points (xi , y j ) in one of the
smaller rectangles in the grid, we compute the height of the surface: f (xi , y j ). Now the average of these
heights should be (depending on the fineness of the grid) close to the average height of the surface:
f (x0 , y0 ) + f (x1 , y0 ) + · · · + f (x0 , y1 ) + f (x1 , y1 ) + · · · + f (xm−1 , yn−1 )
mn
As both m and n go to infinity, we expect this approximation to converge to a fixed value, the actual
average height of the surface. For reasonably nice functions this does indeed happen.

Multiple Integration

The two parts of this product have useful meaning: (b − a)(d − c) is of course the area of the rectangle,
and the double sum adds up mn terms of the form f (x j , yi )∆x∆y, which is the height of the surface at a
point multiplied by the area of one of the small rectangles into which we have divided the large rectangle.
In short, each term f (x j , yi )∆x∆y is the volume of a tall, thin, rectangular box, and is approximately the
volume under the surface and above one of the small rectangles; see Figure 14.2. When we add all of these
up, we get an approximation to the volume under the surface and above the rectangle R = [a, b] × [c, d].
When we take the limit as m and n go to infinity, the double sum becomes the actual volume under the
surface, which we divide by (b − a)(d − c) to get the average height.

Figure 14.2: Approximating the volume under a surface.
Double sums like this come up in many applications, so in a way it is the most important part of this
example; dividing by (b − a)(d − c) is a simple extra step that allows the computation of an average. As
we did in the single variable case, we introduce a special notation for the limit of such a double sum:
n−1 m−1

lim

m,n→∞

∑∑

f (x j , yi )∆x∆y =

i=0 j=0

R

f (x, y) dx dy =

R

f (x, y) dA,

the double integral of f over the region R. The notation dA indicates a small bit of area, without specifying
any particular order for the variables x and y; it is shorter and more “generic” than writing dx dy. The
average height of the surface in this notation is
1
(b − a)(d − c)

ZZ

R

f (x, y) dA.

The next question, of course, is: How do we compute these double integrals? You might think that we
will need some two-dimensional version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, but as it turns out we
can get away with just the single variable version, applied twice.
Going back to the double sum, we can rewrite it to emphasize a particular order in which we want to
add the terms:
!
n−1

m−1

∑ ∑

i=0

j=0

f (x j , yi )∆x ∆y.

14.1. Volume and Average Height

In the sum in parentheses, only the value of x j is changing; yi is temporarily constant. As m goes to infinity,
this sum has the right form to turn into an integral:
m−1

lim

m→∞

∑

f (x j , yi )∆x =

f (x, yi ) dx.

So after we take the limit as m goes to infinity, the sum is

∑

i=0


f (x, yi ) dx ∆y.

Of course, for different values of yi this integral has different values; in other words, it is really a function
applied to yi :
G(y) =
If we substitute back into the sum we get

Z b
a

f (x, y) dx.

n−1

∑ G(yi)∆y.

i=0

This sum has a nice interpretation. The value G(yi ) is the area of a cross section of the region under the
surface f (x, y), namely, when y = yi . The quantity G(yi )∆y can be interpreted as the volume of a solid
with face area G(yi ) and thickness ∆y. Think of the surface f (x, y) as the top of a loaf of sliced bread.
Each slice has a cross-sectional area and a thickness; G(yi )∆y corresponds to the volume of a single slice
of bread. Adding these up approximates the total volume of the loaf. (This is very similar to the technique
we used to compute volumes in Section 8.3, except that there we need the cross-sections to be in some
way “the same”.) Figure 14.3 shows this “sliced loaf” approximation using the same surface as shown in
Figure 14.2. Nicely enough, this sum looks just like the sort of sum that turns into an integral, namely,
n−1

n→∞

Let’s be clear about what this means: we first will compute the inner integral, temporarily treating y as a
constant. We will do this by finding an anti-derivative with respect to x, then substituting x = a and x = b
and subtracting, as usual. The result will be an expression with no x variable but some occurrences of y.
Then the outer integral will be an ordinary one-variable problem, with y as the variable.

Unfortunately, this gives a function for which we can’t find a simple anti-derivative. To complete the
problem we could use Sage or similar software to approximate the integral. Doing this gives a volume of
approximately 8.84, so the average height is approximately 8.84/6 ≈ 1.47.

Because addition and multiplication are commutative and associative, we can rewrite the original double sum:

In other words, we can compute the integrals in either order, first with respect to x then y, or vice versa.
Thinking of the loaf of bread, this corresponds to slicing the loaf in a direction perpendicular to the first.
We haven’t really proved that the value of a double integral is equal to the value of the corresponding
two single integrals in either order of integration, but provided the function is reasonably nice, this is true;
the result is called Fubini’s Theorem.

In this example there is no particular reason to favor one direction over the other; in some cases,
one direction might be much easier than the other, so it’s usually worth considering the two different
possibilities.
Frequently we will be interested in a region that is not simply a rectangle. Let’s compute the volume
under the surface x + 2y2 above the region described by 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ x2 , shown in Figure 14.4.

Figure 14.4: A parabolic region of integration.
In principle there is nothing more difficult about this problem. If we imagine the three-dimensional
region under the surface and above the parabolic region as an oddly shaped loaf of bread, we can still
slice it up, approximate the volume of each slice, and add these volumes up. For example, if we slice
perpendicular to the x axis at xi , the thickness of a slice will be ∆x and the area of the slice will be

What is the average height of the surface over this region? As before, it is the volume divided by the area
of the base, but now we need to use integration to compute the area of the base, since it is not a simple
rectangle. The area is

Which appears easier? In the first, thep
first (inner) integral is easy, because we need an anti-derivative with
respect to y, and the entire integrand 1 − x2 is constant with respect to y. Of course, the second integral
may be more difficult. In the second, the first integral is mildly unpleasant—a trig substitution. So let’s
try the first one, since the first step is easy, and see where that leaves us.

This is a good example of how the order of integration can affect the complexity of the problem. In this
case it is possible to do the other order, but it is a bit messier. In some cases one order may lead to a very
difficult or impossible integral; it’s usually worth considering both possibilities before going very far. ♣

14.2 Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates
Suppose we have a surface given in polar coordinates as z = f (r, θ ) and we wish to find the integral over
some region. We could attempt to translate into rectangular coordinates and do the integration there, but it
is often easier to stay in polar coordinates.
How might we approximate the volume under such a surface in a way that uses polar coordinates
directly? The basic idea is the same as before: we divide the region into many small regions, multiply

14.2. Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates

503

the area of each small region by the height of the surface somewhere in that little region, and add them
up. What changes is the shape of the small regions; in order to have a nice representation in terms of r
and θ , we use small pieces of ring-shaped areas, as shown in Figure 14.7. Each small region is roughly
rectangular, except that two sides are segments of a circle and the other two sides are not quite parallel.
Near a point (r, θ ), the length of either circular arc is about r∆θ and the length of each straight side is
simply ∆r. When ∆r and ∆θ are very small, the region is nearly a rectangle with area r∆r∆θ , and the
volume under the surface is approximately

∑∑ f (ri, θ j )ri∆r∆θ .
In the limit, this turns into a double integral

The surface is a portion of the sphere of radius 2 centered at the origin, in fact exactly one-eighth of the
sphere. We know the formula for volume of a sphere is (4/3)π r3, so the volume we have computed is
(1/8)(4/3)π 23 = (4/3)π , in agreement with our answer.
♣
This example is much like a simple one in rectangular coordinates: the region of interest may be
described exactly by a constant range for each of the variables. As with rectangular coordinates, we can
adapt the method to deal with more complicated regions.

Find the volume under z = 4 − r2 above the region enclosed by the curve r = 2 cos θ , −π /2 ≤

14.2. Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates

505

You might have learned a formula for computing areas in polar coordinates. It is possible to compute
areas as volumes, so that you need only remember one technique. Consider the surface z = 1, a horizontal
plane. The volume under this surface and above a region in the x-y plane is simply 1 · (area of the region),
so computing the volume really just computes the area of the region.
Example 14.6:

Find the area outside the circle r = 2 and inside r = 4 sin θ ; see Figure 14.9.
Solution. The region is described by π /6 ≤ θ ≤ 5π /6 and 2 ≤ r ≤ 4 sin θ , so the integral is

14.3 Moment and Center of Mass
Using a single integral we were able to compute the center of mass for a one-dimensional object with
variable density, and a two dimensional object with constant density. With a double integral we can handle
two dimensions and variable density.
Just as before, the coordinates of the center of mass are
x̄ =

My
M

ȳ =

Mx
,
M

where M is the total mass, My is the moment around the y-axis, and Mx is the moment around the x-axis.
(You may want to review the concepts in Section 8.6.)
The key to the computation, just as before, is the approximation of mass. In the two-dimensional case,
we treat density σ as mass per square area, so when density is constant, mass is (density)(area). If we
have a two-dimensional region with varying density given by σ (x, y), and we divide the region into small
subregions with area ∆A, then the mass of one subregion is approximately σ (xi , y j )∆A, the total mass is
approximately the sum of many of these, and as usual the sum turns into an integral in the limit:
M=

Z x1 Z y1
x0

y0

σ (x, y) dy dx,

and similarly for computations in cylindrical coordinates. Then as before
Mx =
My =

Z x1 Z y1
x
y
Z 0x1 Z 0y1

yσ (x, y) dy dx
xσ (x, y) dy dx.

Example 14.7: Center of Mass of Uniform Plate

Find the center of mass of a thin, uniform plate whose shape is the region between y = cos x and the
x-axis between x = −π /2 and x = π /2.

508

Multiple Integration

Solution. Since the density is constant, we may take σ (x, y) = 1.
It is clear that x̄ = 0, but for practice let’s compute it anyway. First we compute the mass:
M=

Z π /2 Z cos x
−π /2 0

Next,
Mx =

1 dy dx =

Z π /2 Z cos x
−π /2 0

Z π /2

y dy dx =

cos x dx = sin x|−π /2 = 2.

Finally,
My =

Z π /2 Z cos x
−π /2 0

x dy dx =

Z π /2

−π /2

x cos x dx = 0.

So x̄ = 0 as expected, and ȳ = π /4/2 = π /8. This is the same problem as in Example 8.21; it may be
helpful to compare the two solutions.
♣
Example 14.8: Center of Mass of 2-D Plate

Find the center of mass of a two-dimensional plate that occupies the quarter circle x2 + y2 ≤ 1 in
the first quadrant and has density k(x2 + y2 ).
Solution. It seems clear that because of the symmetry of both the region and the density function (both
are important!), x̄ = ȳ. We’ll do both to check our work.

14.4 Surface Area
We next seek to compute the area of a surface above (or below) a region in the x-y plane. How might
we approximate this? We start, as usual, by dividing the region into a grid of small rectangles. We want
to approximate the area of the surface above one of these small rectangles. The area is very close to the
area of the tangent plane above the small rectangle. If the tangent plane just happened to be horizontal,
of course the area would simply be the area of the rectangle. For a typical plane, however, the area is the
area of a parallelogram, as indicated in Figure 14.11. Note that the area of the parallelogram is obviously
larger the more “tilted” the tangent plane.

Figure 14.11: Small parallelograms at points of tangency.
Now recall a curious fact: the area of a parallelogram can be computed as the cross product of two
vectors. We simply need to acquire two vectors, parallel to the sides of the parallelogram and with lengths
to match. But this is easy: in the x direction we use the tangent vector we already know, namely h1, 0, fx i
and multiply by ∆x to shrink it to the right size: h∆x, 0, fx ∆xi. In the y direction we doqthe same thing and
get h0, ∆y, fy ∆yi. The cross product of these vectors is h fx , fy , −1i ∆x ∆y with length fx2 + fy2 + 1 ∆x ∆y,
the area of the parallelogram. Now we add these up and take the limit, to produce the integral
Z x1 Z y1 q
fx2 + fy2 + 1 dy dx.

You may recall that the area of a sphere of radius r is 4π r2 , so half the area of a unit sphere is (1/2)4π = 2π ,
in agreement with our answer.

14.5 Triple Integrals
It will come as no surprise that we can also do triple integrals—integrals over a three-dimensional region.
The simplest application allows us to compute volumes in an alternate way.
To approximate a volume in three dimensions, we can divide the three-dimensional region into small
rectangular boxes, each ∆x × ∆y × ∆z with volume ∆x∆y∆z. Then we add them all up and take the limit,
to get an integral:
Z Z Z
x1

x0

y1

y0

z1

dz dy dx.

z0

Of course, if the limits are constant, we are simply computing the volume of a rectangular box.
Example 14.10: Volume of a Box

Compute the volume of the box with opposite corners at (0, 0, 0) and (1, 2, 3).
Solution. We use an integral to compute the volume of the box:

Of course, this is more interesting and useful when the limits are not constant.
Example 14.11: Volume of a Tetrahedron

Find the volume of the tetrahedron with corners at (0, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (2, 3, 0), and (2, 3, 5).
Solution. The whole problem comes down to correctly describing the region by inequalities: 0 ≤ x ≤ 2,
3x/2 ≤ y ≤ 3, 0 ≤ z ≤ 5x/2. The lower y limit comes from the equation of the line y = 3x/2 that forms one
edge of the tetrahedron in the x-y plane; the upper z limit comes from the equation of the plane z = 5x/2
that forms the “upper” side of the tetrahedron; see Figure 14.12. Now the volume is

surprisingly, triple integrals are sometimes simpler in cylindrical coordinates or spherical coordinates. To
set up integrals in polar coordinates, we had to understand the shape and area of a typical small region into
which the region of integration was divided. We need to do the same thing here, for three dimensional
regions.
The cylindrical coordinate system is the simplest, since it is just the polar coordinate system plus a
z coordinate. A typical small unit of volume is the shape shown in Figure 14.7 “fattened up” in the z
direction, so its volume is r∆r∆θ ∆z, or in the limit, r dr d θ dz.
Example 14.14: Finding Volume

Find the volume under z = 4 − r2 above the quarter circle inside x2 + y2 = 4 in the first quadrant.

Spherical coordinates are somewhat more difficult to understand. The small volume we want will be
defined by ∆ρ , ∆φ , and ∆θ , as pictured in Figure 14.13. The small volume is nearly box shaped, with 4
flat sides and two sides formed from bits of concentric spheres. When ∆ρ , ∆φ , and ∆θ are all very small,
the volume of this little region will be nearly the volume we get by treating it as a box. One dimension of
the box is simply ∆ρ , the change in distance from the origin. The other two dimensions are the lengths of
small circular arcs, so they are r∆α for some suitable r and α , just as in the polar coordinates case.

Figure 14.13: A small unit of volume for spherical coordinates.
The easiest of these to understand is the arc corresponding to a change in φ , which is nearly identical
to the derivation for polar coordinates, as shown in the left graph in Figure 14.14. In that graph we are
looking “face on” at the side of the box we are interested in, so the small angle pictured is precisely ∆φ ,
the vertical axis really is the z axis, but the horizontal axis is not a real axis—it is just some line in the x-y
plane. Because the other arc is governed by θ , we need to imagine looking straight down the z axis, so

14.6. Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates

that the apparent angle we see is ∆θ . In this view, the axes really are the x and y axes. In this graph, the
apparent distance from the origin is not ρ but ρ sin φ , as indicated in the left graph.

14.7 Change of Variables
One of the most useful techniques for evaluating integrals is substitution, both “u-substitution” and trigonometric substitution, in which we change the variable to something more convenient. As we have seen,
sometimes changing from rectangular coordinates to another coordinate system is helpful, and this too
changes the variables. This is certainly a more complicated change, since instead of changing one variable
for another we change an entire suite of variables, but as it turns out it is really very similar to the kinds of
change of variables we already know as substitution.

Figure 14.15: Single change of variable.
Let’s examine the single variable case again, from a slightly different perspective than we have previously used. Suppose we start with the problem
Z 1

x2

0

p
1 − x2 dx;

this computes the area in the left graph
p of Figure 14.15. We use the substitution x = sin u to transform the
√
2
2
function from x 1 − x2 to sin u 1 − sin2 u, and we also convert dx to cos u du. Finally, we convert the
limits 0 and 1 to 0 and π /2. This transforms the integral:
Z 1
0

Z
p
2
x 1 − x dx =

π /2

p
sin u 1 − sin2 u cos u du.
2

We want to notice that there are three different conversions:pthe main function, the differential dx, and the
interval of integration. The function is converted to sin2 u 1 − sin2 u, shown in the right-hand graph of
Figure 14.15. It is evident that the two curves pictured there have the same y-values in the same order, but
the horizontal scale has been changed. Even though the heights are the same, the two integrals
Z 1
0

p
x 1 − x2 dx
2

and

Z π /2
0

p
sin2 u 1 − sin2 u du

are not the same; clearly the right hand area is larger. One way to understand the problem is to note that
if both areas are approximated using, say, ten subintervals, that the approximating rectangles on the right
are wider than their counterparts on the left, as indicated. In the picture, the width of the rectangle on the
left is ∆x = 0.1, between 0.7 and 0.8. The rectangle on the right is situated between the corresponding
values arcsin(0.7) and arcsin(0.8) so that ∆u = arcsin(0.8) − arcsin(0.7). To make the widths match, and
the areas therefore the same, we can multiply ∆u by a correction factor; in this case the correction factor
is approximately cos u = cos(arcsin(0.7)), which we compute when we convert dx to cos u du.

520

Multiple Integration

Now let’s move to functions of two variables. Suppose we want to convert an integral
Z x1 Z y1
x0

y0

f (x, y) dy dx

to use new variables u and v. In the single variable case, there’s typically just one reason to want to change
the variable: to make the function “nicer” so that we can find an antiderivative. In the two variable case,
there is a second potential reason: the two-dimensional region over which we need to integrate is somehow
unpleasant, and we want the region in terms of u and v to be nicer—to be a rectangle, for example. Ideally,
of course, the new function and the new region will be no worse than the originals, and at least one of
them will be better; this doesn’t always pan out.
As before, there are three parts to the conversion: the function itself must be rewritten in terms of u
and v, dy dx must be converted to du dv, and the old region must be converted to the new region. We will
develop the necessary techniques by considering a particular example, and we will use an example we
already know how to do by other means.
Consider
Z 1 Z √1−x2 p
x2 + y2 dy dx.
−1 0

The limits correspond to integrating over the top half of a circular disk, and we recognize that the function
will simplify in polar coordinates, so we would normally convert to polar coordinates:
Z π Z 1√
0

0

r2 r dr d θ =

π
.
3

But let’s instead approach this as a substitution problem, starting with x = r cos θ , y = r sin θ . This pair of
equations describes a function from “r-θ space” to “x-y space”, and because it involves familiar concepts,
it is not too hard to understand what it does. In Figure 14.16 we have indicated geometrically a bit about
how this function behaves. The four dots labeled a–d in the r-θ plane correspond to the three dots in the
x-y plane; dots a and b both go to the origin because r = 0. The horizontal arrow in the r-θ plane has
r = 1 everywhere and θ ranges from 0 to π , so the corresponding points x = r cos θ , y = r sin θ start at
(1, 0) and follow the unit circle counter-clockwise. Finally, the vertical arrow has θ = π /4 and r ranges
from 0 to 1, so it maps to the straight arrow in the x-y plane. Extrapolating from these few examples, it’s
not hard to see that every vertical line in the r-θ plane is transformed to a line through the origin in the x-y
plane, and every horizontal line in the r-θ plane is transformed to a circle with center at the origin in the
x-y plane. Since we are interested in integrating over the half-disk in the x-y plane, we will integrate over
the rectangle [0, π ] × [0, 1] in the r-θ plane, because we now see that the points in this rectangle are sent
precisely to the upper half disk by x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ .

At this point we are two-thirds done with the task: we know the r-θ limits of integration, and we can
easily convert the function to the new variables:
p
p
p
x2 + y2 = r2 cos2 θ + r2 sin2 θ = r cos2 θ + sin2 θ = r.
(14.1)

The final, and most difficult, task is to figure out what replaces dx dy. (Of course, we actually know the
answer, because we are in effect converting to polar coordinates. What we really want is a series of steps
that gets to that right answer but that will also work for other substitutions that are not so familiar.)
Let’s take a step back and remember how integration arises from approximation. When we approximate the integral
p in the x-y plane, we are computing the volumes of tall thin boxes, in this case boxes that
are ∆x × ∆y × x2 + y2 . We are aiming to come up with an integral in the r-θ plane that looks like this:
Z πZ 1
0

r(?) dr d θ .

(14.2)

0

What we’re missing is exactly the right quantity to replace the “?” so that we get the correct answer. Of
course, this integral is also the result of an approximation, in which we add up volumes of boxes that are
∆r × ∆θ × height; the problem is that the height that will give us the correct answer is not simply r. Or put
another way, we can think of the correct height as r, but the area of the base ∆r∆θ as being wrong. The
height r comes from Equation 14.1, which is to say, it is precisely the same as the corresponding height in
the x-y version of the integral. The problem is that the area of the base ∆x × ∆y is not the same as the area
of the base ∆r × ∆θ . We can think of the “?” in the integral as a correction factor that is needed so that
? dr d θ = dx dy.
So let’s think about what that little base ∆r × ∆θ corresponds to. We know that each bit of horizontal
line in the r-θ plane corresponds to a bit of circular arc in the x-y plane, and each bit of vertical line in the
r-θ plane corresponds to a bit of “radial line” in the x-y plane. In Figure 14.17 we show a typical rectangle
in the r-θ plane and its corresponding area in the x-y plane.

Figure 14.17: Corresponding areas.
In this case, the region in the x-y plane is approximately a rectangle with dimensions ∆r × r∆θ , but in
general the corner angles will not be right angles, so the region will typically be (almost) a parallelogram.
We need to compute the area of this parallelogram. We know a neat way to do this: compute the length of
a certain cross product. If we can determine an appropriate two vectors we’ll be nearly done.
Fortunately, we’ve really done this before. The sides of the region in the x-y plane are formed by temporarily fixing either r or θ and letting the other variable range over a small interval. In Figure 14.17, for
example, the upper right edge of the region is formed by fixing θ = 2π /3 and letting r run from 0.5 to 0.75.
In other words, we have a vector function v(r) = hr cos θ0 , r sin θ0 , 0i, and we are interested in a restricted
set of values for r. A vector tangent to this path is given by the derivative v′ (r) = hcos θ0 , sin θ0 , 0i, and

522

Multiple Integration

a small tangent vector, with length approximately equal to the side of the region, is hcos θ0 , sin θ0 , 0i dr.
Likewise, if we fix r = r0 = 0.5, we get the vector function w(θ ) = hr0 cos θ , r0 sin θ , 0i with derivative
w(θ ) = h−r0 sin θ , r0 cos θ , 0i and a small tangent vector h−r0 sin θ0 , r0 cos θ0 , 0i d θ when θ = θ0 (at the
corner we’re focusing on). These vectors are shown in Figure 14.18, with the actual region outlined by a
dotted boundary. Of course, since both ∆r and ∆θ are quite large, the parallelogram is not a particularly
good approximation to the true area.

Figure 14.18: The approximating parallelogram.
The area of this parallelogram is the length of the cross product:
i
j
k
h−r0 sin θ0 , r0 cos θ0 , 0i d θ × hcos θ0 , sin θ0 , 0i dr = −r0 sin θ0 r0 cos θ0 0 d θ dr
cos θ0
sin θ0 0
= h0, 0, −r0 sin2 θ0 − r0 cos2 θ0 i d θ dr
= h0, 0, −r0 i d θ dr.
The length of this vector is r0 dr d θ . So in general, for any values of r and θ , the area in the x-y plane
corresponding to a small rectangle anchored at (θ , r) in the r-θ plane is approximately r dr d θ . In other
words, “r” replaces the “?” in Equation 14.2.
In general, a substitution will start with equations x = f (u, v) and y = g(u, v). Again, it will be straightforward to convert the function being integrated. Converting the limits will require, as above, an understanding of just how the functions f and g transform the u-v plane into the x-y plane. Finally, the small
vectors we need to approximate an area will be h fu , gu , 0i du and h fv , gv , 0i dv. The cross product of these
is h0, 0, fu gv − gu fv i du dv with length | fu gv − gu fv | du dv. The quantity | fu gv − gu fv | is usually denoted

∂ (x, y)
= | f u gv − gu f v |
∂ (u, v)
and called the Jacobian. Note that this is the absolute value of the two by two determinant
f u gu
,
f v gv
which may be easier to remember. (Confusingly, the matrix, the determinant of the matrix, and the absolute
value of the determinant are all called the Jacobian by various authors.)
Because there are two things to worry about, namely, the form of the function and the region of
integration, transformations in two (or more) variables are quite tricky to discover.

Example 14.17: Integral of an Ellipse

Integrate x2 − xy + y2 over the region x2 − xy + y2 ≤ 2.
Solution. The equation x2 − xy + y2 = 2 describes an ellipse as in Figure

is the interior of the ellipse. We will use the transformation x = 2u − 2/3v, y = 2u + 2/3v.
Substituting into the function itself we get
x2 − xy + y2 = 2u2 + 2v2 .

The boundary of the ellipse is x2 − xy + y2 = 2, so the boundary of the corresponding region in the u-v
plane is 2u2 + 2v2 = 2 or u2 + v2 = 1, the unit circle, so this substitution makes the region of integration
simpler.

There is a similar change of variables formula for triple integrals, though it is a bit more difficult to
derive. Suppose we use three substitution functions, x = f (u, v, w), y = g(u, v, w), and z = h(u, v, w). The
Jacobian determinant is now
f u gu hu
∂ (x, y, z)
= f v gv hv .
∂ (u, v, w)

15.1 Curves of Vector Functions
We have already seen that a convenient way to describe a line in three dimensions is to provide a vector
that “points to” every point on the line as a parameter t varies, like
h1, 2, 3i + th1, −2, 2i = h1 + t, 2 − 2t, 3 + 2ti.
Except that this gives a particularly simple geometric object, there is nothing special about the individual functions of t that make up the coordinates of this vector—any vector with a parameter, like
h f (t), g(t), h(t)i, will describe some curve in three dimensions as t varies through all possible values.
Example 15.1: Describing Curves

Describe the curves hcost, sint, 0i, hcost, sint,ti, and hcost, sint, 2ti.
Solution. As t varies, the first two coordinates in all three functions trace out the points on the unit circle,
starting with (1, 0) when t = 0 and proceeding counter-clockwise around the circle as t increases. In the
first case, the z coordinate is always 0, so this describes precisely the unit circle in the x-y plane. In the
second case, the x and y coordinates still describe a circle, but now the z coordinate varies, so that the
height of the curve matches the value of t. When t = π , for example, the resulting vector is h−1, 0, π i.
A bit of thought should convince you that the result is a helix. In the third vector, the z coordinate varies
twice as fast as the parameter t, so we get a stretched out helix. Both are shown in Figure 15.1. On the left
is the first helix, shown for t between 0 and 4π ; on the right is the second helix, shown for t between 0 and
2π . Both start and end at the same point, but the first helix takes two full “turns” to get there, because its
z coordinate grows more slowly.

Vector Functions

Figure 15.1: Two helixes.
A vector expression of the form r(t) = h f (t), g(t), h(t)i is called a vector function; it is a function
from the real numbers R to the set of all three-dimensional vectors. We can alternately think of it as three
separate functions, x = f (t), y = g(t), and z = h(t), that describe points in space. In this case we usually
refer to the set of equations as parametric equations for the curve, just as for a line. While the parameter
t in a vector function might represent any one of a number of physical quantities, or be simply a “pure
number”, it is often convenient and useful to think of t as representing time. The vector function then tells
you where in space a particular object is at any time.
Vector functions can be difficult to understand, that is, difficult to picture. When available, computer
software can be very helpful. When working by hand, one useful approach is to consider the “projections”
of the curve onto the three standard coordinate planes. We have already done this in part: in Example 15.1
we noted that all three curves project to a circle in the x-y plane, since hcost, sinti is a two dimensional
vector function for the unit circle.
Example 15.2: Projections onto a Plane

Graph the projections of hcost, sint, 2ti onto the x-z plane and the y-z plane.
Solution. The two dimensional vector function for the projection onto the x-z plane is hcost, 2ti, or in
parametric form, x = cost, z = 2t. By eliminating t we get the equation x = cos(z/2), the familiar curve
shown on the left in Figure 15.2. For the projection onto the y-z plane, we start with the vector function
hsint, 2ti, which is the same as y = sint, z = 2t. Eliminating t gives y = sin(z/2), as shown on the right in
Figure 15.2.

15.2 Calculus with Vector Functions
A vector function r(t) = h f (t), g(t), h(t)i is a function of one variable—that is, there is only one “input”
value. What makes vector functions more complicated than the functions y = f (x) that we studied in the
first part of this book is of course that the “output” values are now three-dimensional vectors instead of
simply numbers. It is natural to wonder if there is a corresponding notion of derivative for vector functions.
In the simpler case of a function y = s(t), in which t represents time and s(t) is position on a line, we have
seen that the derivative s′ (t) represents velocity; we might hope that in a similar way the derivative of a
vector function would tell us something about the velocity of an object moving in three dimensions.
One way to approach the question of the derivative for vector functions is to write down an expression
that is analogous to the derivative we already understand, and see if we can make sense of it. If we say
that what we mean by the limit of a vector is the vector of the individual coordinate limits, this gives us
r(t + ∆t) − r(t)
∆t→0
∆t
h f (t + ∆t) − f (t), g(t + ∆t) − g(t), h(t + ∆t) − h(t)i

r′ (t) = lim

Starting with a familiar expression for what appears to be a derivative, we find that we can make good
computational sense out of it—but what does it actually mean?
We know how to interpret r(t + ∆t) and r(t)—they are vectors that point to locations in space; if t is
time, we can think of these points as positions of a moving object at times that are ∆t apart. We also know
what ∆r = r(t + ∆t) − r(t) means—it is a vector that points from the head of r(t) to the head of r(t + ∆t),
assuming both have their tails at the origin. So when ∆t is small, ∆r is a tiny vector pointing from one
point on the path of the object to a nearby point. As ∆t gets close to 0, this vector points in a direction that
is closer and closer to the direction in which the object is moving; geometrically, it approaches a vector
tangent to the path of the object at a particular point.

∆r

r(t)

r(t + ∆t)

Figure 15.3: Approximating the derivative.
Unfortunately, the vector ∆r approaches 0 in length; the vector h0, 0, 0i is not very informative. By
dividing by ∆t, when it is small, we effectively keep magnifying the length of ∆r so that in the limit it
doesn’t disappear. Thus the limiting vector h f ′ (t), g′(t), h′(t)i will (usually) be a good, non-zero vector
that is tangent to the curve.
What about the length of this vector? It’s nice that we’ve kept it away from zero, but what does it
measure, if anything? Consider the length of one of the vectors that approaches the tangent vector:
|r(t + ∆t) − r(t)|
r(t + ∆t) − r(t)
=
∆t
|∆t|
The numerator is the length of the vector that points from one position of the object to a “nearby” position;
this length is approximately the distance travelled by the object between times t and t + ∆t. Dividing this
distance by the length of time it takes to travel that distance gives the average speed. As ∆t approaches
zero, this average speed approaches the actual, instantaneous speed of the object at time t.
By performing an “obvious” calculation to get something that looks like the derivative of r(t), we get
precisely what we would want from such a derivative: the vector r′ (t) points in the direction of travel of
the object and its length tells us the speed of travel. In the case that t is time, then, we call v(t) = r′ (t) the
velocity vector. Even if t is not time, r′ (t) is useful—it is a vector tangent to the curve.
Example 15.3:

We have seen that r = hcost, sint,ti is a helix. Compute r′ and |r′ |.
p
√
Solution. We compute r′ = h− sint, cost, 1i, and |r√′ | = sin2 t + cos2 t + 1 = 2. Thinking of this as a
description of a moving object, its speed is always 2; see Figure 15.4.

Figure 15.4: A tangent vector on the helix.

Example 15.4:

The velocity vector for hcost, sint, costi is h− sint, cost, − sinti. As before, the first two coordinates
mean that from above this curve looks like a circle. The z coordinate is now also periodic, so that
as the object moves around the curve its height oscillates up and down. In fact it turns out that the
curve is a tilted ellipse, as shown in Figure 15.5.

Figure 15.5: The ellipse r = hcost, sint, costi.
Example 15.5:

The velocity vector for hcost, sint, cos 2ti is h− sint, cost, −2 sin 2ti. The z coordinate is now oscillating twice as fast as in the previous example, so the graph is not surprising; see Figure 15.6.

Example 15.6:

Find the angle between the curves ht + 1,t − 2,t 2 − 4i and ht + 2, −t + 3,t 2 + 1i where they meet.
Solution. The angle between two curves at a point is the angle between their tangent vectors—any tangent
vectors will do, so we can use the derivatives. We need to find the point of intersection, evaluate the two
derivatives there, and finally find the angle between them.
To find the point of intersection, we need to solve the equations
t +1 = u+2
t − 2 = −u + 3

t 2 − 4 = u2 + 1

Solving either of the first two equations for u and substituting in the third gives t = 3. This together with
u = 2 satisfies all three equations. Thus the two curves meet at (4, 1, 5), the first curve when t = 3 and the
second curve when t = 2.
The derivatives are h1, 1, 2ti and h1, −1, 2ti; at the intersection point these are h1, 1, 6i and h1, −1, 4i.
The cosine of the angle between them is then

Note that because the cross product is not commutative you must remember to do the three cross
products in formula (5.) in the correct order.
When the derivative of a function f (t) is zero, we know that the function has a horizontal tangent
line, and may have a local maximum or minimum point. If r′ (t) = 0, the geometric interpretation is quite
different, though the interpretation in terms of motion is similar. Certainly we know that the object has
speed zero at such a point, and it may thus be abruptly changing direction. In three dimensions there are
many ways to change direction; geometrically this often means the curve has a cusp or a point, as in the
path of a ball that bounces off the floor or a wall.
Example 15.8:

Suppose that r(t) = h1 +t 3,t 2 , 1i, so r′ (t) = h3t 2, 2t, 0i. This is 0 at t = 0, and there is indeed a cusp
at the point (1, 0, 1), as shown in Figure 15.7.

Sometimes we will be interested in the direction of r′ but not its length. In some cases, we can still
work with r′ , as when we find the angle between two curves. On other occasions it will be useful to work
with a unit vector in the same direction as r′ ; of course, we can compute such a vector by dividing r′ by
its own length. This standard unit tangent vector is usually denoted by T:
T=

In a sense, when we computed the angle between two tangent vectors we have already made use of the
unit tangent, since
r′ · s′

Now that we know how to make sense of r′ , we immediately know what an antiderivative must be,
namely
Z

Z
r(t) dt = h f (t) dt, g(t) dt, h(t) dti,

if r = h f (t), g(t), h(t)i. What about definite integrals? Suppose that v(t) gives the velocity of an object at
time t. Then v(t)∆t is a vector that approximates the displacement of the object over the time ∆t: v(t)∆t
points in the direction of travel, and |v(t)∆t| = |v(t)||∆t| is the speed of the object times ∆t, which is
approximately the distance travelled. Thus, if we sum many such tiny vectors:
n−1

∑ v(ti)∆t

we get an approximation to the displacement vector over the time interval [t0,tn ]. If we take the limit we
get the exact value of the displacement vector:

15.3 Arc Length
Sometimes it is useful to compute the length of a curve in space; for example, if the curve represents the
path of a moving object, the length of the curve between two points may be the distance travelled by the
object between two times.
Recall that if the curve is given by the vector function r then the vector ∆r = r(t + ∆t) − r(t) points
from one position on the curve to another, as depicted in Figure 15.3. If the points are close together,
the length of ∆r is close to the length of the curve between the two points. If we add up the lengths of
many such tiny vectors, placed head to tail along a segment of the curve, we get an approximation to the
length of the curve over that segment. In the limit, as usual, this sum turns into an integral that computes
precisely the length of the curve. First, note that
|∆r| =

|∆r|
∆t ≈ |r′ (t)| ∆t,
∆t

when ∆t is small. Then the length of the curve between r(a) and r(b) is

♣

Notice that there is nothing special about y = ln x, except that the resulting integral can be computed.
In general, given any y =qf (x), we can think of this as the vector function r(t) = ht, f (t), 0i. Then r′ (t) =

h1, f ′ (t), 0i and |r′ (t)| =

1 + ( f ′ )2 . The length of the curve y = f (x) between a and b is thus
Z bq

1 + ( f ′ (x))2 dx.

Unfortunately, such integrals are often impossible to do exactly and must be approximated.
One useful application of arc length is the arc length parameterization. A vector function r(t) gives
the position of a point in terms of the parameter t, which is often time, but need not be. Suppose s is
the distance along the curve from some fixed starting point; if we use s for the variable, we get r(s), the
position in space in terms of distance along the curve. We might still imagine that the curve represents the
position of a moving object; now we get the position of the object as a function of how far the object has
travelled.
Example 15.12:

Suppose r(t) = hcost, sint, 0i. We know that this curve is a circle of radius 1. While t might
represent time, it can also in this case represent the usual angle between the positive x-axis and r(t).
The distance along the circle from (1, 0, 0) to (cost, sint, 0) is also t —this is the definition of radian
measure. Thus, in this case s = t and r(s) = hcos s, sin s, 0i.
Example 15.13:

Suppose r(t) = hcost, sint,ti. We know that this curve is a helix. Find the distance along the helix
from (1, 0, 0) to (cost, sint,t) and use this to write the arc length parameterization r̂(s) of r(t).
Solution. The distance along the helix from (1, 0, 0) to (cost, sint,t) is

solve s = f (t) for t, getting t = g(s), and substitute this back into r(t) to get r̂(s) = r(g(s)).

s(t) =

and take the derivative, we get
s′ (t) = |r′ (t)|.

Here s′ (t) is the rate at which the arc length is changing, and we have seen that |r′ (t)| is the speed of a
moving object; these are of course the same.
Suppose that r(s) is given in terms of arc length; what is |r′ (s)|? It is the rate at which arc length is

15.4 Curvature
Given a curve r(t), we would like to be able to measure, at various points, how sharply curved it is. Clearly
this is related to how “fast” a tangent vector is changing direction, so a first guess might be that we can
measure curvature with |r′′ (t)|. A little thought shows that this is flawed; if we think of t as time, for
example, we could be tracing out the curve more or less quickly as time passes. The second derivative

15.4. Curvature

539

|r′′ (t)| incorporates this notion of time, so it depends not simply on the geometric properties of the curve
but on how quickly we move along the curve.
Example 15.14:

Consider r(t) = hcost, sint, 0i and s(t) = hcos 2t, sin 2t, 0i. Both of these vector functions represent
the unit circle in the x-y plane, but if t is interpreted as time, the second describes an object moving
twice as fast as the first. Computing the second derivatives, we find |r′′ (t)| = 1, |s′′ (t)| = 4.
To remove the dependence on time, we use the arc length parameterization. If a curve is given by r(s),
then the first derivative r′ (s) is a unit vector, that is, r′ (s) = T(s). We now compute the second derivative
r′′ (s) = T′ (s) and use |T′ (s)| as the “official” measure of curvature, usually denoted κ .
Example 15.15:

We have seen that the arc length parameterization of a particular helix is
√
√
√
r(s) = hcos(s/ 2), sin(s/ 2), s/ 2i
√
√
Computing the second derivative gives r′′ (s) = h− cos(s/ 2)/2, − sin(s/ 2)/2, 0i with length 1/2.
What if we are given a curve as a vector function r(t), where t is not arc length? We have seen that arc
length can be difficult to compute; fortunately, we do not need to convert to the arc length parameterization
to compute curvature. Instead, let us imagine that we have done this, so we have found t = g(s) and then
formed r̂(s) = r(g(s)). The first derivative r̂′ (s) is a unit tangent vector, so it is the same as the unit tangent
vector T(t) = T(g(s)). Taking the derivative of this we get
d
dt
T(g(s)) = T′ (g(s))g′(s) = T′ (t) .

The curvature is the length of this vector:

κ = |T′ (t)||

|r (t)|

(Recall that we have seen that ds/dt = |r′ (t)|.) Thus we can compute the curvature by computing only
derivatives with respect to t; we do not need to do the conversion to arc length.

Solution. First r′ (t) = h− sint, cost, 1i, |r′ (t)| =

Finally, κ = 1/ 2/ 2 = 1/2, as before.

Example 15.17:

Consider this circle of radius a: r(t) = ha cost, a sint, 1i. Find the curvature, κ.
p
Solution. First r′ (t) = h−a sint, a cost, 0i. Then |r′ (t)| = a2 sin2 t + a2 cos2 t = a, and T(t) = h−a sint, a cost, 0i/a.
Now
T′ (t) = h−a cost, −a sint, 0i/a
and |T′ (t)| = 1. Finally,

κ = 1/a

the curvature of a circle is everywhere the inverse of the radius. It is sometimes useful to think of curvature
as describing what circle a curve most resembles at a point. The curvature of the helix in the previous
example is 1/2; this means that a small piece of the helix looks very much like a circle of radius 2, as
shown in Figure 15.9.

Compare this to Figure 15.6. The highest curvature occurs where the curve has its highest and lowest
points, and indeed in the picture these appear to be the most sharply curved portions of the curve, while
the curve is almost a straight line midway between those points.
♣
Let’s see why this alternate formula is correct. Starting with the definition of T, r′ = |r′ |T so by the
product rule r′′ = |r′ |′ T + |r′ |T′ . Then by Theorem 12.7 the cross product is
r′ × r′′ = |r′ |T × |r′ |′ T + |r′ |T × |r′ |T′

= |r′ ||r′ |′ (T × T) + |r′ |2 (T × T′ )
= |r′ |2 (T × T′ )

because T × T = 0, since T is parallel to itself. Then
|r′ × r′′ | = |r′ |2 |T × T′ |

= |r′ |2 |T||T′ | sin θ
= |r′ |2 |T′ |

using Exercise 15.2.8 in Section 15.2 to see that θ = π /2. Dividing both sides by |r′ |3 then gives the
desired formula.
We used the fact here that T′ is perpendicular to T; the vector N = T′ /|T′ | is thus a unit vector perpendicular to T, called the unit normal to the curve. Occasionally of use is the unit binormal B = T × N, a
unit vector perpendicular to both T and N.

15.5 Acceleration Vectors
We have already seen that if t is time and an object’s location is given by r(t), then the derivative r′ (t) is
the velocity vector v(t). Just as v(t) is a vector describing how r(t) changes, so is v′ (t) a vector describing
how v(t) changes, namely, a(t) = v′ (t) = r′′ (t) is the acceleration vector.
Example 15.19:

Suppose r(t) = hcost, sint, 1i.
Then r′ (t) = v(t) = h− sint, cost, 0i and v′ (t) = a(t) =
h− cost, − sint, 0i. This describes the motion of an object traveling on a circle of radius 1, with
constant z coordinate 1. The velocity vector is of course tangent to the curve; note that a · v = 0, so
v and a are perpendicular. In fact, it is not hard to see that a points from the location of the object
to the center of the circular path at (0, 0, 1).
Recall that the unit tangent vector is given by T = v/|v|, so v = |v|T. If we take the derivative of both
sides of this equation we get
a = |v|′ T + |v|T′ .

(15.1)

Also recall the definition of the curvature, κ = |T′ |/|v|, or |T′ | = κ |v|. Finally, recall that we defined
the unit normal vector as N = T′ /|T′ |, so T′ = |T′ |N = κ |v|N. Substituting into Equation 15.1 we get
a = |v|′ T + κ |v|2 N.

(15.2)

The quantity |v(t)| is the speed of the object, often written as v(t); |v(t)|′ is the rate at which the speed
is changing, or the scalar acceleration of the object, a(t). Rewriting Equation 15.2 with these gives us
a = aT + κ v2 N = aT T + aN N;
aT is the tangential component of acceleration and aN is the normal component of acceleration. We
have already seen that aT measures how the speed is changing; if you are riding in a vehicle with large
aT you will feel a force pulling you into your seat. The other component, aN , measures how sharply your

15.5. Acceleration Vectors

543

direction is changing with respect to time. So it naturally is related to how sharply the path is curved,
measured by κ , and also to how fast you are going. Because aN includes v2 , note that the effect of speed
is magnified; doubling your speed around a curve quadruples the value of aN . You feel the effect of this as
a force pushing you toward the outside of the curve, the “centrifugal force.”
In practice, if want aN we would use the formula for κ :
aN = κ |v|2 =

|r′ × r′′ | ′ 2 |r′ × r′′ | |v × a|
|r | =
=

16.1 Vector Fields
This chapter is concerned with applying calculus in the context of vector fields. A two-dimensional vector
field is a function f that maps each point (x, y) in R2 to a two-dimensional vector hu, vi, and similarly
a three-dimensional vector field maps (x, y, z) to hu, v, wi. Since a vector has no position, we typically
indicate a vector field in graphical form by placing the
pvector f (x, y) with
p its tail at (x, y). Figure 16.1
2
2
shows a representation of the vector field f (x, y) = hx/ x + y + 4, −y/ x2 + y2 + 4i. For such a graph
to be readable, the vectors must be fairly short, which is accomplished by using a different scale for the
vectors than for the axes. Such graphs are thus useful for understanding the sizes of the vectors relative to
each other but not their absolute size.

Vector fields have many important applications, as they can be used to represent many physical quantities: the vector at a point may represent the strength of some force (gravity, electricity, magnetism) or a
velocity (wind speed or the velocity of some other fluid).
We have already seen a particularly important kind of vector field—the gradient. Given a function
f (x, y), recall that the gradient is f = ∇ f = h fx (x, y), fy (x, y)i, a vector that depends on (is a function of) x
and y. We usually picture the gradient vector with its tail at (x, y), pointing in the direction of maximum
increase. Vector fields that are gradients have some particularly nice properties, as we will see. An
important example is

16.2 Divergence and Curl
Divergence and curl are two measurements of vector fields that are very useful in a variety of applications.
Both are most easily understood by thinking of the vector field as representing a flow of a liquid or gas; that
is, each vector in the vector field should be interpreted as a velocity vector. Roughly speaking, divergence
measures the tendency of the fluid to collect or disperse at a point, and curl measures the tendency of the
fluid to swirl around the point. Divergence is a scalar, that is, a single number, while curl is itself a vector.
The magnitude of the curl measures how much the fluid is swirling, the direction indicates the axis around
which it tends to swirl. These ideas are somewhat subtle in practice, and are beyond the scope of this
course.
Recall that if f is a function, the gradient of f is given by


∂f ∂f ∂f
∇f =
, ,
.
∂x ∂y ∂z

16.2. Divergence and Curl

A useful mnemonic for this (and for the divergence and curl, as it turns out) is to let


∂ ∂ ∂
∇=
, ,
,
∂x ∂y ∂z
that is, we pretend that ∇ is a vector with rather odd looking entries. Recalling that hu, v, wia = hua, va, wai,
we can then think of the gradient as

∇f =

f=

that is, we simply multiply the f into the vector.
The divergence and curl can now be defined in terms of this same vector ∇ by using the cross product
and dot product.

Here are two simple but useful facts about divergence and curl.
Theorem 16.1: Divergence of Curl is Zero
∇ · (∇ × f) = 0.
In words, this says that the divergence of the curl is zero.
Theorem 16.2: Curl of Gradient is Zero
∇ × (∇ f ) = 0.
That is, the curl of a gradient is the zero vector. Recalling that gradients are conservative vector fields,
this says that the curl of a conservative vector field is the zero vector. Under suitable conditions, it is also

548

Vector Calculus

true that if the curl of f is 0 then f is conservative. (Note that this is exactly the same test that we discussed
at the end of Section 16.3.3.)
Example 16.3:

Let f = h2ex − y, −x, ez i. Show that f is conservative and find the function f such that f = h fx , fy , fz i.
Solution. If f = h2ex − y, −x, ez i then ∇ × f = h0, 0, (−1) − (−1)i = 0. Thus, f is conservative, and we can
exhibit this directly by finding the corresponding f .
Since fx = 2ex − y, f = 2ex − xy + g(y, z). Since fy = −x, it must be that gy = 0, so g(y, z) = C + h(z).
Thus f = 2ex − xy +C + h(z) and
fz = h′ (z) = ez ,
so h(z) = ez . This leaves f = 2ex − xy + ez +C.

16.3 Line Integrals
We have so far integrated “over” intervals, areas, and volumes with single, double, and triple integrals. We
now investigate integration over or “along” a curve—“line integrals” are really “curve integrals”.

16.3.1. Line Integrals of a Function
As with other integrals, a geometric example may be easiest to understand. Consider the function f = x+y
and the parabola y = x2 in the x-y plane, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2. Imagine that we extend the parabola up to the
surface f , to form a curved wall or curtain, as in Figure 16.2. What is the area of the surface thus formed?
We already know one way to compute surface area, but here we take a different approach that is more
useful for the problems to come.

Figure 16.2: Approximating the area under a curve.
As usual, we start by thinking about how to approximate the area. We pick some points along the part
of the parabola we’re interested in, and connect adjacent points by straight lines; when the points are close
together, the length of each line segment will be close to the length along the parabola. Using each line
segment as the base of a rectangle, we choose the height to be the height of the surface f above the line
segment. If we add up the areas of these rectangles, we get an approximation to the desired area, and in
the limit this sum turns into an integral.
Typically the curve is in vector form, or can easily be put in vector form. Then as we have seen in
Section 15.3, the length of one of the straight line segments in the approximation is close to ds = |v′ | dt.

In this example we have v(t) = ht,t 2i, and ds = |v′ | dt = 1 + 4t 2 dt. Therefore the integral is

16.3.2. Line Integrals of a Vector Field
Now we turn to a perhaps more interesting example. Recall that in the simplest case, the work done by a
force on an object is equal to the magnitude of the force times the distance the object moves; this assumes
that the force is constant and in the direction of motion. We have already dealt with examples in which the
force is not constant; now we are prepared to examine what happens when the force is not parallel to the
direction of motion.
We have already examined the idea of components of force, in Example 12.5: the component of a
force F in the direction of a vector v is
F·v
v,
|v|2

16.3. Line Integrals

551

the projection of F onto v. The length of this vector, that is, the magnitude of the force in the direction of
v, is
F·v
,
|v|

the scalar projection of F onto v. If an object moves subject to this (constant) force, in the direction of v,
over a distance equal to the length of v, the work done is
F·v
|v| = F · v.
|v|

Thus, work in the vector setting is still “force times distance”, except that “times” means “dot product”.
If the force varies from point to point, it is represented by a vector field F (note we use a capital F here
to denote force). the displacement vector v may also change, as an object may follow a curving path in
two or three dimensions. Suppose that the path of an object is given by a vector function r(t); at any point
along the path, the (small) tangent vector r′ ∆t gives an approximation to its motion over a short time ∆t,
so the work done during that time is approximately F · r′ ∆t; the total work over some time period is then
Z t1

F · r′ dt.

It is useful to rewrite this in various ways at different times. We start with

16.3.3. The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals
One way to write the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Theorem 6.13) is:
Z b
a

f ′ (x) dx = f (b) − f (a).

That is, to compute the integral of a derivative f ′ we need only compute the values of f at the endpoints.
Something similar is true for line integrals of a certain form.

Theorem 16.9: Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals

Suppose a curve C is given by the vector function r(t), with a = r(a) and b = r(b). Then
Z

∇ f · d r = f (b) − f (a),

C

provided that r is sufficiently nice.
Proof. We write r = hx(t), y(t), z(t)i, so that r′ = hx′ (t), y′ (t), z′(t)i. Also, we know that ∇ f = h fx , fy , fz i.
Then

z = d f /dt, where f

fx x′ + fy y′ + fz z′ dt.

in this context means f (x(t), y(t), z(t)),

f ′ (t) dt = f (b) − f (a).

In this context, f (a) = f (x(a), y(a), z(a)). Since a = r(a) = hx(a), y(a), z(a)i, we can write f (a) =
f (a)—this is a bit of a cheat, since we are simultaneously using f to mean f (t) and f (x, y, z), and since
f (x(a), y(a), z(a)) is not technically the same as f (hx(a), y(a), z(a)i), but the concepts are clear and the
different uses are compatible. Doing the same for b, we get
Z

C

∇ f · dr =

Z b
a

f ′ (t) dt = f (b) − f (a) = f (b) − f (a).
♣

This theorem, like the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, says roughly that if we integrate a “derivativelike function” ( f ′ or ∇ f ) the result depends only on the values of the original function ( f ) at the endpoints.
If a vector field f is the gradient of a function, f = ∇Rf , we say that f is a conservative vector field. If F
is a conservative force field, then the integral for work, C F· dr, is in the form required by the Fundamental
Theorem of Line Integrals. This means that in a conservative force field, the amount of work required to
move an object from point a to point b depends only on those points, not on the path taken between them.

the object.
Solution. The straightforward way to do this involves substituting the components of r into F, forming
the dot product F · r′ , and then trying to compute the integral, but this integral is extraordinarily messy,

♣

Another immediate consequence of the Fundamental Theorem involves closed paths. A path C is
closed if it forms a loop, so that travelling over the C curve brings you back to the starting point. If C is a
closed path, we can integrate around it starting at any point a; since the starting and ending points are the
same,
Z
∇ f · dr = f (a) − f (a) = 0.
C

For example, in a gravitational field (an inverse square law field) the amount of work required to move an
object around a closed path is zero. Of course, it’s only the net amount of work that is zero. It may well
take a great deal of work to get from point a to point b, but then the return trip will “produce” work. For
example, it takes work to pump water from a lower to a higher elevation, but if you then let gravity pull
the water back down, you can recover work by running a water wheel or generator. (In the real world you
won’t recover all the work because of various losses along the way.)
To make use of the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, we need to be able to spot conservative
vector fields f and to compute f so that f = ∇ f . Suppose that f = h f1 , f2 i = ∇ f . Then f1 = fx and
f2 = fy , and provided that f is sufficiently nice, we know from Clairaut’s Theorem (13.23) that ∂∂y f1 =
fxy = fyx =
∂
∂ y f1

∂
∂ x f2 .

If we compute

∂
∂ y f1

and

∂
∂ x f2

and find that they are not equal, then f is not conservative.

∂
∂ x f2 ,

If
=
then, again provided that f is sufficiently nice, we can be assured that f is conservative.
Ultimately, what’s important is that we be able to find f ; as this amounts to finding anti-derivatives, we
may not always succeed.
Example 16.11:

Find an f so that h4x3 − y2 , 4 − 2xyi = ∇ f .
Solution. First, note that

∂
(4x3 − y2 ) = −2y
∂y

and

∂
(4 − 2xy) = −2y,
∂x

so the desired f does exist. This means that fx = 4x3 − y2 , so that f = x4 − xy2 + g(y); the first two terms
are needed to get 4x3 − y2 , and the g(y) could be any function of y, as it would disappear upon taking a
derivative with respect to x. Likewise, since fy = 4 − 2xy, f = 4y − xy2 + h(x). The question now becomes,
is it possible to find g(y) and h(x) so that
x4 − xy2 + g(y) = 4y − xy2 + h(x),
and of course the answer is yes: g(y) = 4y, h(x) = x4 . Thus, f = 4y + x4 − xy2 .

♣

We can test a vector field f = h f1 , f2 , f3 i in a similar way. Suppose that h f1 , f2 , f3 i = h fx , fy , fz i. If
we temporarily hold z constant, then f (x, y, z) is a function of x and y, and by Clairaut’s Theorem ∂∂y f1 =

556

Vector Calculus

fxy = fyx = ∂∂x f2 . Likewise, holding y constant implies
get ∂∂z f2 = fyz = fzy = ∂∂y f3 . Conversely, if we find that
f is conservative.

16.4 Green’s Theorem
We now come to the first of three important theorems that extend the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
to higher dimensions. (The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals has already done this in one way, but

16.4. Green’s Theorem

557

in that case we were still dealing with an essentially one-dimensional integral.) They all share with the
Fundamental Theorem the following rather vague description: To compute a certain sort of integral over
a region, we may do a computation on the boundary of the region that involves one fewer integrations.
Note that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary
(the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.
Theorem 16.12: Green’s Theorem

We already know one case, not
I particularly interesting, in which this theorem is true: If f is conser-

vative, we know that the integral

C

f · dr = 0, because any integral of a conservative vector field around

a closed curve is zero. We also know in this case that ∂ f1 /∂ y = ∂ f2 /∂ x, so the double integral in the
theorem is simply the integral of the zero function, namely, 0. So in the case that f is conservative, the
theorem says simply that 0 = 0.

In this case, none of the integrations are difficult, but the second approach is somewhat tedious because
of the necessity to set up three different integrals. In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the
single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into
the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best.
Here is a clever use of Green’s Theorem: We know that areas can be computed using double integrals,
namely,

D

computes the area of region D. If we can find f1 and f2 so that ∂ f2 /∂ x − ∂ f1 /∂ y = 1, then the area is also
Z

∂D

f1 dx + f2 dy.

It is quite easy to do this: f1 = 0, f2 = x works, as do f1 = −y, f2 = 0 and f1 = −y/2, f2 = x/2.
Example 16.14:

An ellipse centered at the origin, with its two principal axes aligned with the x and y axes, is given
by
x2 y2
+ = 1.
a2 b2
Find the area of the interior of the ellipse.
Solution. We find the area of the interior of the ellipse via Green’s theorem. To do this we need a vector
equation for the boundary; one such equation is ha cost, b sinti, as t ranges from 0 to 2π . We can easily
verify this by substitution:

Now we look at the proof of Green’s Theorem.
Proof. We cannot here prove Green’s Theorem in general, but we can do a special case. We seek to prove
that for a vector field f = h f1 , f2 i

Vector Calculus

Here we have simply used the ordinary Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since for the inner integral
we are integrating a derivative with respect to y: an antiderivative of ∂ f1 /∂ y with respect to y is simply
f1 (x, y), and then we substitute g1 and g2 for y and subtract.
H
Now we need to manipulate C f1 dx. The boundary of region D consists of 4 parts, given by the
equations y = g1 (x), x = b, y = g2 (x), and x = a. On the portions x = b and x = a, dx = 0 dt, so the
corresponding integrals are zero. For the other two portions, we use the parametric forms x = t, y = g1 (t),
a ≤ t ≤ b, and x = t, y = g2 (t), letting t range from b to a, since we are integrating counter-clockwise
around the boundary. The resulting integrals give us

f1 dx =

f1 (t, g1(t)) − f1(t, g2(t)) dt

which is the result of the double integral times −1, as desired.
The equation involving f2 is essentially the same, and left as an exercise.

♣

We can now rewrite Green’s Theorem using the concepts of divergence and curl; these rewritten versions in turn are closer to some later theorems we will see.
Suppose we write a two dimensional vector field in the form f = h f1 , f2 , 0i, where f1 and f2 are functions of x and y. Then

(16.2)

Roughly speaking, the right-most integral adds up the curl (tendency to swirl) at each point in the region;
the left-most integral adds up the tangential components of the vector field around the entire boundary.
Green’s Theorem says these are equal, or roughly, that the sum of the “microscopic” swirls over the region
is the same as the “macroscopic” swirl around the boundary.
Next, suppose that the boundary ∂ D has a vector form r(t), so that r′ (t) is tangent to the boundary,
and T = r′ (t)/|r′ (t)| is the usual unit tangent vector. Writing r = hx(t), y(t)i we get

T= ′

So far, we’ve just rewritten the original integral using alternate notation. The last integral looks just like

Roughly speaking, the first integral adds up the flow across the boundary of the region, from inside to out,
and the second sums the divergence (tendency to spread) at each point in the interior. The theorem roughly
says that the sum of the “microscopic” spreads is the same as the total spread across the boundary and out
of the region.

Proof. Again this theorem is too difficult to prove here, but a special case is easier. In the proof of a
special case of Green’s Theorem, we needed to know that we could describe the region of integration in
both possible orders, so that we could set up one double integral using dx dy and another using dy dx.
Similarly here, we need to be able to describe the three-dimensional region E in different ways.
We start by rewriting the triple integral:

where B is the region in the y-z plane over which we integrate. The boundary surface of E consists of a
“top” x = g2 (y, z), a “bottom” x = g1 (y, z), and a “wrap-around side” that is vertical to the y-z plane. To
integrate over the entire boundary surface, we can integrate over each of these (top, bottom, side) and add
the results. Over the side surface, the vector N is perpendicular to the vector i, so

Thus, we are left with just the surface integral over the top plus the surface integral over the bottom. For
the top, we use the vector function r = hg2 (y, z), y, zi which gives ry × rz = h1, −g2y , −g2z i; the dot product
of this with i = h1, 0, 0i is 1. Then
ZZ

f1 i · N dS =

In almost identical fashion we get

bottom

f1 i · N dS = −

ZZ

B

f1 (g1 (y, z), y, z) dA,

where the negative sign is needed to make N point in the negative x direction. Now
ZZ

D

f1 i · N dS =

ZZ

B

f1 (g2 (y, z), y, z) dA −

ZZ

B

f1 (g1 (y, z), y, z) dA,

which is the same as the value of the triple integral above.

♣

It is worth noting that this theorem is also referred to as Gauss’ Theorem. We now compute an example.

Example 16.16:

Let f = h2x, 3y, z2 i, and consider the three-dimensional volume inside the cube with faces parallel
to the principal planes and opposite corners at (0, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 1). Compute the two integrals of
the divergence theorem.

2 + 3 + 2z dx dy dz = 6.

The surface integral must be separated into six parts, one for each face of the cube. One face is z = 0 or
r = hu, v, 0i, 0 ≤ u, v ≤ 1. Then ru = h1, 0, 0i, rv = h0, 1, 0i, and ru × rv = h0, 0, 1i. We need this to be
oriented downward (out of the cube), so we use h0, 0, −1i and the corresponding integral is

Another face is y = 1 or r = hu, 1, vi. Then ru = h1, 0, 0i, rv = h0, 0, 1i, and ru × rv = h0, −1, 0i. We
need a normal in the positive y direction, so we convert this to h0, 1, 0i, and the corresponding integral is

The remaining four integrals have values 0, 0, 2, and 1, and the sum of these is 6, in agreement with
the triple integral.

16.6 Vector Functions for Surfaces
We have dealt extensively with vector equations for curves, r(t) = hx(t), y(t), z(t)i. A similar technique
can be used to represent surfaces in a way that is more general than the equations for surfaces we have
used so far. Recall that when we use r(t) to represent a curve, we imagine the vector r(t) with its tail at
the origin, and then we follow the head of the arrow as t changes. The vector “draws” the curve through
space as t varies.
Suppose we instead have a vector function of two variables,
r(u, v) = hx(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)i.

As both u and v vary, we again imagine the vector r(u, v) with its tail at the origin, and its head sweeps
out a surface in space. A useful analogy is the technology of CRT video screens, in which an electron
gun fires electrons in the direction of the screen. The gun’s direction sweeps horizontally and vertically
to “paint” the screen with the desired image. In practice, the gun moves horizontally through an entire
line, then moves vertically to the next line and repeats the operation. In the same way, it can be useful to
imagine fixing a value of v and letting r(u, v) sweep out a curve as u changes. Then v can change a bit, and
r(u, v) sweeps out a new curve very close to the first. Put enough of these curves together and they form a
surface.
Example 16.18:

Consider the function r(u, v) = hv cos u, v sin u, vi. For a fixed value of v, as u varies from 0 to 2π,
this traces a circle of radius v at height v above the x-y plane. Put lots and lots of these together,and
they form a cone, as in Figure 16.4.

16.6. Vector Functions for Surfaces

567

Recall that from the vector equation of the curve we can compute the unit tangent T, the unit normal N,
and the binormal vector B = T × N; you may want to review Section 15.3. The binormal is perpendicular
to both T and N; one way to interpret this is that N and B define a plane perpendicular to T, that is,
perpendicular to the curve; since N and B are perpendicular to each other, they can function just as i and j
do for the x-y plane.
Example 16.19:

The curve given by
r = h(2 + cos(3u/2)) cosu, (2 + cos(3u/2)) sinu, sin(3u/2)i
is called a trefoil knot. Then c(v) = N cos v + B sin v is a vector equation for a unit circle in a plane
perpendicular to the curve described by r, except that the usual interpretation of c would put its
center at the origin. We can fix that simply by adding c to the original r: let f = r(u) + c(v). For
a fixed u this draws a circle around the point r(u); as u varies we get a sequence of such circles
around the curve r, that is, a tube of radius 1 with r at its center. We can easily change the radius;
for example r(u) + ac(v) gives the tube radius a; we can make the radius vary as we move along the
curve with r(u) + g(u)c(v), where g(u) is a function of u.
As shown in Figure 16.5, it is hard to see that the plain knot is knotted; the tube makes the structure
apparent. Of course, there is nothing special about the trefoil knot in this example; we can put a tube
around (almost) any curve in the same way.

Figure 16.5: Tubes around a trefoil knot, with radius 1/2 and 3 cos(u)/4.
We have previously examined surfaces given in the form f (x, y). It is sometimes useful to represent
such surfaces in the more general vector form, which is quite easy: r(u, v) = hu, v, f (u, v)i. The names of
the variables are not important of course; instead of disguising x and y, we could simply write r(x, y) =
hx, y, f (x, y)i.
We have also previously dealt with surfaces that are not functions of x and y; many of these are easy
to represent in vector form. One common type of surface that cannot be represented as z = f (x, y) is a
surface given by an equation involving only x and y. For example, x + y = 1 and y = x2 are “vertical”
surfaces. For every point (x, y) in the plane that satisfies the equation, the point (x, y, z) is on the surface,
for every value of z. Thus, a corresponding vector form for the surface is something like h f (u), g(u), vi;
for example, x + y = 1 becomes hu, 1 − u, vi and y = x2 becomes hu, u2, vi.

Yet another sort of example is the sphere, say x2 + y2 + z2 = 1. This cannot be written in the form
z = f (x, y), but it is easy to write in vector form; indeed this particular surface is much like the cone,
since it has circular cross-sections, or we can think of it as a tube around a portion of the z-axis, with
a√radius that varies
√ depending on where along the axis we are. One vector expression for the sphere is
2
h 1 − v cos u, √1 − v2 sin u, vi—this emphasizes the tube structure, as it is naturally viewed as drawing a
circle of radius 1 − v2 around the z-axis at height v. We could also take a cue from spherical coordinates,
and write hsin u cos v, sin u sin v, cos ui, where in effect u and v are φ and θ in disguise.
It is quite simple to use a computer program to plot any surface for which you have a vector representation. Using different vector functions sometimes gives different looking plots, because the computer in
effect draws the surface by holding one variable constant and then the other.
Here’s a simple but striking example: the plane x + y + z = 1 can be represented quite naturally as
hu, v, 1 − u − vi. However we could also think of painting the same plane by choosing a particular point
on the plane, say (1, 0, 0), and then drawing circles or ellipses (or any of a number of other curves) as if
that point were the origin in the plane. For example, h1 − v cos u − v sin u, v sin u, v cos ui is one such vector
function. Note that while it may not be obvious where this came from, it is quite easy to see that the sum
of the x, y, and z components of the vector is always 1. Computer renderings of the plane using these two
functions are shown in Figure 16.6.

Figure 16.6: Two representations of the same plane.
Suppose we know that a plane contains a particular point (x0 , y0 , z0 ) and that two vectors u = hu0 , u1 , u2 i
and v = hv0 , v1 , v2 i are parallel to the plane but not to each other. We know how to get an equation for the
plane in the form ax + by + cz = d, by first computing u × v. It’s even easier to get a vector equation:
r(u, v) = hx0 , y0 , z0 i + uu + vv.
The first vector gets to the point (x0 , y0 , z0 ) and then by varying u and v, uu + vv gets to every point in the
plane.
Returning to x + y + z = 1, the points (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1) are all on the plane. By subtracting
coordinates we see that h−1, 0, 1i and h−1, 1, 0i are parallel to the plane, so a third vector form for this
plane is
h1, 0, 0i + uh−1, 0, 1i + vh−1, 1, 0i = h1 − u − v, v, ui.

This is clearly quite similar to the first form we found.
We have already seen (Section 14.4) how to find the area of a surface when it is defined in the form
f (x, y). Finding the area when the surface is given as a vector function is very similar. Looking at the plots
of surfaces we have just seen, it is evident that the two sets of curves that fill out the surface divide it into
a grid, and that the spaces in the grid are approximately parallelograms. As before this is the key: we can
write down the area of a typical small parallelogram and add them all up with an integral.
Suppose we want to approximate the area of the surface r(u, v) near r(u0 , v0 ). The functions r(u, v0 )
and r(u0 , v) define two curves that intersect at r(u0 , v0 ). The derivatives of r give us vectors tangent to
these two curves: ru (u0 , v0 ) and rv (u0 , v0 ), and then ru (u0 , v0 ) du and rv (u0 , v0 ) dv are two small tangent
vectors, whose lengths can be used as the lengths of the sides of an approximating parallelogram. Finally,
the area of this parallelogram is |ru × rv | du dv and so the total surface area is

√u, 0i and

16.7 Surface Integrals
In the integral for surface area, from Equation 16.7,
Z bZ d
a

c

|ru × rv | du dv,

the integrand |ru × rv | du dv is the area of a tiny parallelogram, that is, a very small surface area, so it is
reasonable to abbreviate it dS; then a shortened version of the integral is
ZZ

D

1 · dS.

We have already seen that if D is a region in the plane, the area of D may be computed with
ZZ

D

1 · dA,

so this is really quite familiar, but the dS hides a little more detail than does dA.

16.7. Surface Integrals

Just as we can integrate functions f (x, y) over regions in the plane, using
ZZ

D

f (x, y) dA,

so we can compute integrals over surfaces in space, using
ZZ

D

f (x, y, z) dS.

In practice this means that we have a vector function r(u, v) = hx(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)i for the surface, and
the integral we compute is
Z bZ d
a

c

f (x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v))|ru × rv | du dv.

That is, we express everything in terms of u and v, and then we can do an ordinary double integral.
Example 16.21: Mass and Center of Mass

Suppose a thin object occupies the upper hemisphere of x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 and has density σ (x, y, z) =
z. Find the mass and center of mass of the object. (Note that the object is just a thin shell; it does
not occupy the interior of the hemisphere.)
Solution. We write the hemisphere as r(φ , θ ) = hcos θ sin φ , sin θ sin φ , cos φ i, 0 ≤ φ ≤ π /2 and 0 ≤ θ ≤
2π . So rθ = h− sin θ sin φ , cos θ sin φ , 0i and rφ = hcos θ cos φ , sin θ cos φ , − sin φ i. Then
rθ × rφ = h− cos θ sin2 φ , − sin θ sin2 φ , − cos φ sin φ i
and
|rθ × rφ | = | sin φ | = sin φ ,

since we are interested only in 0 ≤ φ ≤ π /2. Finally, the density is z = cos φ and the integral for mass is
Z 2π Z π /2
0

0

cos φ sin φ d φ d θ = π .

By symmetry, the center of mass is clearly on the z-axis, so we only need to find the z-coordinate of
the center of mass. The moment around the x-y plane is
Z 2π Z π /2

Now suppose that f is a vector field; imagine that it represents the velocity of some fluid at each point
in space. We would like to measure how much fluid is passing through a surface D, the flux across D. As
usual, we imagine computing the flux across a very small section of the surface, with area dS, and then
adding up all such small fluxes over D with an integral. Suppose that vector N is a unit normal to the
surface at a point; f · N is the scalar projection of f onto the direction of N, so it measures how fast the fluid
is moving across the surface. In one unit of time the fluid moving across the surface will fill a volume of

572

f · N dS, which is therefore the rate at which the fluid is moving across a small patch of the surface. Thus,
the total flux across D is
ZZ
ZZ
f · N dS =
f · dS,
D

defining dS = N dS.
As usual, certain conditions must be met for this to work out; chief among them is the nature of the
surface. As we integrate over the surface, we must choose the normal vectors N in such a way that they
point “the same way” through the surface. For example, if the surface is roughly horizontal in orientation,
we might want to measure the flux in the “upwards” direction, or if the surface is closed, like a sphere,
we might want to measure the flux “outwards” across the surface. In the first case we would choose N
to have positive z component, in the second we would make sure that N points away from the origin.
Unfortunately, there are surfaces that are not orientable: they have only one side, so that it is not possible
to choose the normal vectors to point in the “same way” through the surface. The most famous such
surface is the Möbius strip shown in Figure 16.7. It is quite easy to make such a strip with a piece of paper
and some tape. If you have never done this, it is quite instructive; in particular, you should draw a line
down the center of the strip until you return to your starting point. No matter how unit normal vectors are
assigned to the points of the Möbius strip, there will be normal vectors very close to each other pointing
in opposite directions.

Solution. We write the cone as a vector function: r = hv cos u, v sin u, vi, 0 ≤ u ≤ 2π and 0 ≤ v ≤ 2. Then
ru = h−v sin u, v cos u, 0i and rv = hcos u, sin u, 1i and ru × rv = hv cos u, v sin u, −vi. The third coordinate

16.8 Stokes’ Theorem
Recall that one version of Green’s Theorem (see Equation 16.2) is
Z

∂D

f · dr =

ZZ

D

(∇ × f) · kdA.

Here D is a region in the x-y plane and k is a unit normal to D at every point. If D is instead an orientable
surface in space, there is an obvious way to alter this equation, and it turns out still to be true:
Theorem 16.23: Stokes’ Theorem

Provided that the quantities involved are sufficiently nice, and in particular if D is orientable,
Z

∂D

f · dr =

ZZ

D

(∇ × f) · N dS,

if ∂ D is oriented counter-clockwise relative to N.
The proof of Stokes’ Theorem will follow a discussion and several examples of the Theorem in use.
Note how little has changed: k becomes N, a unit normal to the surface, and dA becomes dS, since this
is now a general surface integral. The phrase “counter-clockwise relative to N” means that if we take the
direction of N to be “up”, then we go around the boundary counter-clockwise when viewed from “above”.
Example 16.24:
p
Let f = hy2 z, x2 z, xy2 i and the surface D be x = 1 − y2 − z2 , oriented in the positive x direction. It
quickly becomes apparent that the surface integral in Stokes’ Theorem is intractable, so compute
the line integral.
Solution. The boundary of D is the unit circle in the y-z plane, r = h0, cos u, sin ui, 0 ≤ u ≤ 2π . The integral

are difficult, but you may be able to find a second surface E so that

E

(∇ × f) · NdS

has the same value but is easier to compute.
In the previous example, the line integral was easy to compute. But we might also notice that another
surface E with the same boundary is the flat disk y2 + z2 ≤ 1.
Example 16.25:

Let f = hy2 z, x2 z, xy2 i and the surface E be y2 + z2 ≤ 1. Compute the surface integral.
Solution. The unit normal N for this surface is simply i = h1, 0, 0i. We compute the curl:
∇ × f = h2xy − x2 , 0, 2xz − 2yzi.
Since x = 0 everywhere on the surface,
(∇ × f) · N = h0, 0, 2xz − 2yzi · h1, 0, 0i = 0,
so the surface integral is
ZZ

E

0 dS = 0,

as before. In this case, of course, it is still somewhat easier to compute the line integral, avoiding ∇ × f
entirely.
♣
Now let’s look at the proof of Stokes’ Theorem.
Proof. We can prove here a special case of Stokes’ Theorem, which perhaps not too surprisingly uses
Green’s Theorem.
Suppose the surface D of interest can be expressed in the form z = g(x, y), and let f = h f1 , f2 , f3 i. Using

5.4.13 Notice that f (−2) = 19, f (0) = −11, and f (5) = 19 and f is a continuous function. By the
Intermediate Value Theorem there exists a root in [−2, 0] and [0, 5]. Choose x0 = 0, then x4 ≈ −0.93242.
Choose x0 = 5, then x4 ≈ 3.93242.
5.4.14

(a) x4 ≈ 1.00022 . . .

(b) x = 1 is the root of f . Our approximation in part (a) was correct to 3 decimal places.
(c) x1 = 1. The root is found in one iteration of Newton’s Method.
5.4.15 cos(π /2) = 0, so x1 is undefined.
